        "text": "This story was originally posted in /r/talesfromretail, but they removed it and told me to put it here.\n\nOver the summer, I worked at a local golf course to save up some money before heading off to college. I was a Cart Barn Attendant, so my job was to clean golf carts, handle rental clubs (selling, checking them out, and checking them in), and help customers with other stuff when necessary. Golf is actually a surprisingly stressful game; as a result, customers can actually get pretty angry over little things.\n\nAt my course, the washing station for golf carts was really close to the 18th hole. This means that whenever I washed carts, I could see everything that happened on the 18th hole. One day, as I was washing carts, I saw a guy with rental clubs slice his initial drive. He flubbed the next shot too and hit his ball into a sand trap near a water hazard on the 18th hole.\n\n&gt;\"FUCK THIS SHIT, I'M DONE!\"\n\nHe then proceeds to throw the $100 rental driver into the water hazard. When he comes back to return his rental clubs, the driver was obviously missing. I got my boss and he charged him the $100 replacement fee for the driver. The guy protested but my boss didn't budge.\n\nTo this day, I'm just grateful that my boss fished the driver out of the water hazard himself. He didn't make me do it and I'm really just happy about that.",

So after giving an apartment away and taking the advertisement down from some list sites, I will still get calls from people asking about the apartment. Some of them will be people that submitted an application asking for a status update. Some of them will be people that took down the information but only after several days, have the opportunity to use the information to call several possibilities to see if the apartments are still available.  Usually the calls go like this...  \n&gt;*Caller A:* Hello! Is the apartment still available?  \n&gt;*me:* nope.    \n\nbut sometimes I get the weird ones...  \n\n&gt;**Caller B:** Hello.  \n&gt;**me:** Hi.   \n&gt;**Caller B:** I'm calling to see if I can see the apartment that is on XXXXlist.   \n&gt;**me:** There is no apartment on that XXXXlist.  \n&gt;**Caller B:** What? Yes there is! There is an apartment listed for the city of XXX for the price of XXX.  \n&gt;**me:** There was an ad for it. It was taken down because the owner gave it away.   \n&gt;**Caller B:** Your lying! I'm looking at it right now!   \n&gt;**me:** What is the date in your world?   \n&gt;**Caller B:** Excuse me?  \n&gt;**me:** What is the todays' day of the week?   \n&gt;**Caller B:** It's Sunday.   \n&gt;**me:** Is the sky blue in your world too?    \n&gt;**Caller B:** What the FXXX are you talking about?  \n&gt;**me:** I took the ad down on Friday. So if you can see it now... that means you must be from an alternative universe earth where the owner wasn't able to find a renter for that particular apt.   \n&gt;**Caller B:** WHAT THE F...  \nThen I hung on her. I wonder what the color of her sky is.  She didn't call back, so I may never really know. ",

        "text": "[edits] were done to make it more readable. \n\nLast night I met a very cheap and shady potential customer for a studio apartment that I'm trying to rent. At the time of the call, I was in a hardware store trying to find the correct applicator pad for a floor wax I have. And I also use my phone for own personal calls, so I tend to try to get the caller to speak first so I can identify if it's personal or business related. It started innocently enough.   \n&gt;*the phone rings*  \n&gt;**Me:** Hi.    \n&gt;**Caller:** Hello.   \n&gt;**Me:** Yes?   \n&gt;**Caller:** I saw an ad in XXX and is it still available?  \n&gt;**Me:** Yes it is. How many people?  \n&gt;**Caller:** Two. Can I see it now?   \n&gt;**Me:** It's a bit late and I don't live in the building. I can see you tomorrow anytime after 10AM.   \n&gt;**Caller:** My wife and I work long hours. She is a hotel rep and I'm a truck driver. Can we please see this tonight? We can be there in twenty minutes.   \n&gt;**Me:** There is heavy traffic in the streets due to this rain storm. It may take me thirty or forty minutes to get there.   \n&gt;**Caller :** Please, we both want to see the apartment and we don't have time any other day this week.   \n&gt;**Me:** Okay. I'll be there in thirty minutes.   \n\nLucky for both of us, the rain storm and the parking lot disguised as a highway clears up in several minutes. I get to the building within thirty minutes from the hardware store. At the building I notice 2 people standing on the steps. The female is a young Asian, high heel, over the knee length boots and a really tiny tight dress. Geez lady, what type of Hotel Rep are you? The man is a young Spanish looking person dressed in bulk and looks like he's carrying some sort of tool in his inner pocket. His hands are shoved into his pockets and for the meeting he never remove them from his pocket. I decide to call the number and to see if that's them. They call me before I do.   \n\n&gt;**female Caller:** Hi! We are at the building.   \n&gt;**Me:** Oh. I'll be there in a few minutes, can you please refresh my memory on who you are?  \n&gt;**female Caller:** um. Hold on.   \n&gt;**male Caller:** Hello?   \n&gt;**Me:**Hi. The lady told me that you two are at the building. I will be there in a few minutes. I'm sorry, Where did you two worked again?  \n&gt;**male caller:** We're bartenders at a hotel. We make good money and I can prove everything. Thank you for seeing us so late.   \n&gt;**Me:** No problem. Bye.   \n\nI then re-checked the number to make sure it was the same number as before. It was. Oh no. People playing games. So I headed over there and got stopped by a pair of Russians men who read ad and decided to show up out of the blue. I told them to wait a few minutes outside for I had a prior appointment. They told me sure and waited outside as I lead the other two inside. I showed off the place and after some discussion among themselves they wandered back to me.   \n\n&gt;**female:** We like this place. Can we give a deposit to hold this place now?  \n&gt;**Me:** It doesn't work like that here. If you are interested, there is an application for $10 and you just need to fill it out and bring it back with proofs of income &amp; ID and a credit report if you have one.   \n\nThe woman is stopped by the male and he steps forward while pushing her behind him. The guy tells me a sob story about working for business for many years with no contract or pay stubs and if a job letter would be sufficient. I tell them that I'm not the one who decides or investigates you. \"I would think the more you bring, the better your application will look to the owner and the investigator. So if you have this year's taxes, that should help.\" He becomes wary at this point. He looks around himself and tells the woman to stop fidgeting even though she wasn't. She whispers to him that she didn't do this year but she has last year and she has the money for the application. He tells her to be quiet and she meekly follows suit.   \n\n&gt;**Male:** \"Look, maybe there is something we could work out between each other,\" He gestures at the woman, \" That could skip all of this?\"  \n&gt;**Me:** I have no involvement in the decision making process. I just show the apartment, give out info and collect the fee if they want an application.   \n&gt;**Male:** Okay. Can I see the application before I decide to pay for it?  \n&gt;**Me:** No.   \n&gt;**Male:** Oh come on, work with me here.   \n&gt;**Me:** I work for my boss not for you.   \n&gt;**Male:** Alright. Then we aren't interested right now. I'll call that number again and try to see the owner.   \n&gt;**Me:** And you'll get me. The owner isn't going to waste time unless the applicant is vetted by the investigator and the investigator won't meet with you either.   \n\nThe woman at this point tries to say something but she is stopped by the man. They both leave. The Russian pair eye the two walking away and then ask me it's still available. I tell them that I just show the place off and hand out applications for a small fee. I don't decide anything. One of the pair talks to the other in their language and they both decide to check out the apartment. One of them stays behind the other one the entire conversation. He seems to defer to him. The other one tells me that he owns and runs a hotel. He wants a small place to save enough money to buy a house later. He says he can give me all the money now and take this place. I tell him what I told the other pair and he gets a bit angry and asks what else he can provide to help push things further for him over the others. I remind him that I don't decide and just show it. His friend talks to him in their language and he says, \"Okay. I understand your position. I'll go get the money for the application.\" As we are leaving he asks how many people are being investigated and I tell him 5. He decides that is too many and tells me that he's not coming back.",

I forgot how to post stuff in reddit. \n\nI'm a property manager for a group of apartment buildings scattered about XXX. I and a few workers recently spruced up an apartment after the renter took off for the wild unknown. I put up an advertisement on a popular list site for stuff and waited for the call to come in. The following is a call where things got annoying. \n\n&gt;The phone rings.  \n&gt;Me: Hello?  \n&gt;Caller 1: Hi.   \n&gt;Me: Yes?  \n&gt;Caller 1: I'm calling about the ad about the studio apartment located at XXX. Is it still available?  \n&gt;Me: Yes it is. How many people are looking to rent it?  \n&gt;Caller 1: So can I come by to see this place?  \n&gt;Me: Yes and How many people are looking to rent?  \n&gt;Caller 1: I can be out there by XXX PM and I have a good job with lots of money.   \n&gt;Me: How many people are looking to rent?  \n\nThe caller at this point hangs up. I don't bother calling them back because I'm not hurting for potential customers. At XXX PM, I get a call from Caller 1.   \n\n&gt;Caller 1: WHERE ARE YOU!  \n&gt;Me: Hello?  \n&gt;Caller 1: I have been waiting for an HOUR with my clients!  \n&gt;Me: Why?  \n&gt;Caller 1: WHY!? WHY THE F DO YOU THINK?  \n\nHe seriously used the letter F instead of the curse word.   \nI then hanged up. I didn't remember him or the conversation we had at that point until later. I had a lot of calls from real estate agents and potential renters by themselves wanting to see the apartment. So his odd call got lost in the shuffle. He called back after several minutes went by. At this point I remembered who he is.   \n\n&gt;Me: Hello.   \n&gt;Caller 1: I am trying to show your studio apartment to a some of my clients that would like to rent the studio.   \n&gt;Me: Ok. How many people are looking to rent?  \n&gt;Caller 1: You don't need to know that.   \n\nI hung up the phone on him. I don't like those type of real estate agents. They tend to waste my time. They usually act like royalty and try to push the owners or agents of the owners around.  It's like they don't understand that there are people that are successful without using them. He called back.   \n\n&gt;Caller 1: Don't hang up on me again!  \n&gt;Me: Then stop being rude. How many people are looking at this apartment?   \n&gt;Caller 1: Ten.   \n&gt;Me: That's too many for one studio.   \n&gt;Caller 1: What type of idiot...  \n\nI hung up again and blocked his number finally. He called back with a different number. Perhaps one of those ten people.   \n\n&gt;Caller 1: I'm sorry. Please don't hang up on me. I have ten people with me that want to see that apartment. There are not together and it's mix of couples and single people that are interested.   \n&gt;Me: Do they roughly make above XXX amount of income annually?  \n&gt;Caller 1: why?   \n&gt;Me: Because the rent is XXX and when you multiply that by 12 you get XXX and living expense which includes their electric bill would mean they would need roughly more than XXX to live in this apartment.   \n&gt;Caller 1: You don't need to know that. All you need to know is if they can pay the rent.   \n&gt;Me: That's exactly what I just said.   \n&gt;Caller 1: Are you coming out here or not?  \n&gt;Me: Why are you there? We didn't make an appointment.   \n&gt;Caller 1: I told you that I would be there here at XXX time!  \n&gt;Me: That's not how you make an appointment with me. Clearly you are wasting my time. Goodbye.   \n\nI hung up on him. I got six more calls from him which I hung up on as soon as I identified him. I found out by my renters who live in the building that the individual started to ring every doorbell until the one of the apartments finally buzzed him in the front door. Then he knocked on the empty apartment for a few minutes. He gave up when the last of his potential clients left him. He pounded the empty apartment door and cursed the building before leaving.   ",

Working Sunday night, nobody comes in after 7:30 all the times i worked there, sit there and do nothing.

The receptionist tells me that manager does not like when people clock out early. So i take her advice and go down to the pool again to make sure nothing is there. 10:00 rolls around and i clock out and leave. Next day i get a phone call asking me why i left early. I stated that i left at 10:00 and this is when my shift ends. I get told the receptionist \"took note\" that i tried to leave at 9:40. I get told i am not working next week and that they will call to tell me if i am working the week after that. Obviously they are looking for a new person and don't want to let me go just in case they cant find anyone. This is too much power play bullshit for a minimal wage job that i do once a week. Not to mention that this club makes me do more maintenance work than any other club. Thankfully when one door closes another one opens and another club called me, not to mention this is my favorite club to work at and i am friends with all the other people that work there. What disgusts me the most is they do not have the gall to fire me outright, they tell me its a company policy when its obviously not, its a person issue they have with me. And i don't like that the people that are so quick to do something never worked my position and don't understand that at every other club if there is no one there you are allowed to close 30mins early. If you got through the whole rant thank you. I just wanted to get this off my chest.",

It literally took him 20 minutes to get 100 ft.  He stopped and talked to everyone!  He knew them by name and asked about their kids by name and what school they were in.  I was Blown Away!!

I explain it's all pretty basic until the last six inches.  It got real quiet at the mention of the magic words 'Six Inches'  So I made a joke that, \"I'm used to working with six inches.\"\nHe says, Dead seriously, \"That's too bad, I don't have that problem myself.\" and walks out.\nF*ckin' Prick, after all.\n",

Anyway, this one time . . . . . . \nWe were shooting at the Statue of Liberty.  I was to pick up Major Celeb in NJ.  But first we had to get his 'Forward Person' on board to check out the boat.  This is unusual.  We do a lot of movies, and never had this.  But this guy is easily a top 10 box office Star.\n   So, on the boat is my deckhand, and my boss, the owner, (who always shows up for movie shoots,) and me.  We go up to Midtown to get this Fwd person.  Turns out, it's a really cute, late 20s lady.  Super friendly.  She rides in the wheelhouse w/ owner and myself.  Owner is all over her.  She's blowing him off.  I want nothing to do with this.  (It never goes well, despite what Dear Penthouse claims.)  Suddenly, she leans way forward into my space and says, &gt;\"You look really familiar\"  \nNot wanting to get between the owner and her, I just say, \n&gt;\"Yeah, I get that a lot.\"  \nShe persists,  \n&gt;\"But who is it??\"  \n&gt;\"IDK, I get Tom Selleck a lot.\"  (NK, like a lot, I am 6'-4\" and do look a little like him.  My last 3 GFs had me in their phones as Tom, Magnum, and Selleck)   \n&gt;\"Yeah, I see that, but No, that's not it.\"  \nOwner is getting pissy, and tries to get between us.  I say, \n&gt;\"Oh, one ex used to call me 'Mr. Big'\"  \n&gt;\"That's IT!!  Right around the eyes!!\"  \nI look my boss right in the eye and tell her, \n&gt;\"Yeah, I don't think she was talking about my eyes.\"  \nHe almost fell down the stairs.  She laughed and blushed.  He just yelled, \n&gt;\"We are NOT calling you Mr. Big!\"\nOkay, that was just the first part of the trip.\n\nThen we go down to Jersey City to pick up Mr. Celeb.  He shows up with his 2 kids, like 10 and 12 yrs old.  Okay, that's cool.  As we are backing out, he points up to the buildings in Jersey City and says, \n&gt;\"See that kids?  That's NEW YORK CITY.  Where I grew up!\"  \nI lean over shaking my head, \n&gt;\"That's Jersey City, New York is behind us.\"  \nGuess who kept his mouth shut the rest of the trip?  \n\nSo we get to the Statue, and this guy has a 200 ft yacht standing by as his dressing room.  (We were just transportation.)  He goes off to work, and the kids are on board with me.  They are bored and sad.  Clearly these kids have been sheltered their whole lives.  Non-social, the whole bit.  So I try to warm them up a bit.  After about an hour, we are told we have to clear the dock for filming.  So we go stand off a quarter mile.  Waiting waiting waiting.  The kids are climbing the walls.  I feel really bad for them.  \n&gt;\"Hey kids, want a tour?\"  \n&gt;\"SURE!!\"  \nSo I slowly drift away and head up to the city and show them the Brooklyn Bridge and give some local knowledge and some stories.  Then . . . . all at once, the radios and phones blow the hell up!!  &gt;\"Where are you??? Do you have (Celebs) kids???  He's freaking the fuck out!!!  You just kidnapped his kids!!!  Get TF back here!!  NOW!!\"  \nNow I'm no stranger to trouble, and frankly, Celebs do nothing for me.  I head back and send the kids off.  Several reps come to tell me off, and throw me off the job.  Before they are done, (Celeb) walks in.  \n&gt;\"Hey man, I just want to thank you for taking care of my kids.  They loved the tour and I appreciate you entertaining them while I work.\"  \nEveryone walks out quietly.  Apparently they told dad, and he manned up.  It was a good day.",

        "text": "It's been a bit. I'm still in command of my own assembly line, running the machines with my assistant and QA guy. You may remember that I had some complaints about my old assistant, Onions. My new assistant, however, made me realize that there was even more that Onions could have been screwing up.\n\nTo that end, I present three stories about my new assistant, who I'll dub Angelo. Angelo is a pretty cool guy, but some of the stuff he does makes me want to bash my forehead on the table like I'm trying to kill a fly. All three of these stories start in the same spot, which I should point out that not only has a pallet jack specifically for our use, but is also ten feet away from a water fountain.\n\nIn fact, that water fountain is a major point of contention in the first story. While preparing the chemical cocktail that was necessary for our rocks, we needed 4oz of water. Since I was setting up the machine, I told Angelo to go get that water. He took the measuring cylinder and started off. I was expecting him to pass back in front of me on his way to the water fountain once he made it around all the machines, but after a few moments I realized that he wasn't going to the fountain right by us. He was off, through our staging area, past the other machines, down the main hall, to the hand sinks by the break room, where he let a small solo stream slowly fill the cylinder. Instead of walking ten feet, he went nearly 200.\n\nOur second story has a couple of similar overtones to the first. In this one, he was sent out to get about 300 pieces of a specific rock. Naturally, the Forklift Guy brings these rocks by before the order actually shows up on our schedule and puts them in the staging area. Angelo knew this. He'd pulled plenty of rocks from the staging area before. On this order, he confidently strolls past the staging area where the appropriate rocks are clearly visible. Walking up to a staging area for a completely different set of machines, he then decides that he needs to go to the warehouse and take them from there. Coincidentally, moments before, the Forklift Guy had set aside a pile of the very quantity of the very rocks that Angelo was looking for, but then had gotten called off to pick something up somewhere else. Angelo drags those rocks 300 feet back to our machines. The Forklift Guy comes by looking for the rocks, and him and I shared a moment reflecting on some of the things that we'd seen Angelo do. Again, he went ten times as far as he needed to, while effectively negating both the work Forklift Guy had done and was trying to do.\n\nThe last story happened after I messed up some cobalt rocks, and we needed six boxes of replacements. Naturally, I have my assistant do all the bitch work, and so I send Angelo to the warehouse to procure them. Each box is about 20 pounds, so I was really surprised when he walked off without our pallet jack. More surprising was that, when he came back without any, he felt it necessary to dutifully let me know that there were indeed six more boxes in the warehouse, before finally grabbing the pallet jack and making the trip back a second time to actually grab them. This one was especially baffling considering that we have thousands of these in our warehouse, but in his defense, he only walked twice the distance he had to.\n\nI promised three, but here's a bonus story. In the staging area was a full pallet of rocks, but Angelo just needed to bring about eight boxes of them over to the machines. Since it was a full pallet, though, it was still wrapped all the way - and this particular type of rock was wrapped in every annoying way possible. My approach to the situation would be to pull the pallet over, dispose of the wrapping in the bins by my machine, take the boxes off from the pallet while it's by the machine, and then bring it back to the staging area for the Forklift Guy to take away. Instead, Angelo leaves it in the staging area. First he brings the plastic wrapping 30 feet to our bins, then walks back to the pallet. Then he brings the plastic bands back the 30 feet to our bins, then walks back. He does the same thing with the board on the top of the pallet, then starts carrying the boxes over individually. He literally walked 720 feet when he could have walked sixty.\n\nI could probably come up with another three stories about this guy in the next week. Sometimes, watching him work literally hurts. He's a cool guy, though.",

I love seeing their reactions after it's set. For me, it just feels like the final \"gift\" they can give their loved one. Anyway, I've been working with a lady who lost her husband in 2013 from a heart attack. The headstone she bought was very simple, but we were able to add a few details to make it really personal. Every thing was chosen with her husband's personality in mind, even the font. We finally got it delivered and set Friday, and I emailed her to let her know it was ready for her to visit. 30 minutes later or so, I see her walking up to the office. She was walking differently, like really determined or angry, and my heart sank because I thought she was about to come in and tell me she hated it, or something was wrong with it. When she opened the door, I said, \"Do you love it?\" and then she just started bawling. She threw her arms around me and just hugged me and cried into my shirt and said, \"I love it so much. It's better than I could have ever imagined it would be, and I know he would love it so much too.\" After a few minutes, she stopped hugging me and told me that his birthday was the next day, and all her kids had come home from college to celebrate his birthday and that the timing was just perfect. When she left, I just sat at my desk and cried. It was so sad, but it also made me happy that she loved it so much. Later that afternoon, I got an email from her thanking me and telling me again how much she loved it. She said a lot of really nice things, and it just makes me feel super validated! ",

However today was a bit different than the usual crappy mornings that are faced in industry. I get to work on time somehow and get clocked in. I check the production logs for Fridays second shift, they ran 50 parts over rate. My only thought was \"kudos buddy ya had a good night\". Then I went through the normal checklist of things to start my machines up. And lo and behold the tool bar for my smaller finishing lathe is loose. Great. So I check the few parts we still have that were run through it friday. Their no good. Mention this to my supervisor and find out all the other parts have already been sent to be heat treated... wonderful. I fix the tool bar and think to myself \"ok not a bad deal just an honest mistake I can talk to him tonight\".  \n\nI get to running my machines and everything is going ok until a coworker starts talking to me   \nCoworker =c.  \nMe = me.  \n\n&gt;C: did you hear about the guy on second shift?  \n&gt;Me: no, what'd he do outside of the normal fuckups?  \n&gt;C: he hung himself Saturday.  \n&gt;Me: bullshit. That cocky little pricks never gonna die.  \n&gt;C: I'm being serious. (Shows me his parents facebook)  \n&gt;Me: well fuck... didn't see that coming...  \nMaybe five minutes later I hear that all three of our companies remaining engineers resigned friday. I texted one of them who I trust to give me an honest answer.  \n\n&gt;Me: hey so how long does (redacted) really have before they're shut down?  \n&gt;Engineer: 2 months.  \nHopefully Tuesday goes better.",

Correction, our platform doesn't have the latest excel and is limited to a 200 something column excel download. Haha, tech companies really should not be this behind. However, as this major client asks for such a file on their own survey, obviously, we have our engineers pull it out from the back end. \n\nWell the client isn't easy. They don't like the format of it, as it is different from when you would download it straight from the platform. So we ask our engineers to reformat it (bad idea to be in with because if our system doesn't do it, IT DOESNT DO IT) \n\nMy manager, who is also the CEO's wife (haha, that's always a bad sign) pushes back and says no, engineers, go manually format this excel sheet. \n\nBackground info: this survey has 222 questions. \n\nSo our engineers do this and deliver. The client is FURIOUS. Why? Because the formatting is completely screwed. Our engineers ( located in India) have an immediate holiday, but the U.S office is open of course and our manager asks me and my team to MANUALLY Format this. \n\nSo I say to her: \"I feel uncomfortable with this task because we are manually hand manipulating data. There are too many opportunities for error\". \n\nI also am not an excel guru... So touching this excel sheet already freaked me out. Especially with real data from a clients survey. \n\nMy manager, in turn, says I am an insubordinate. \n\nWhich I suppose is technically the nice version of saying \"you do whatever I tell you to, or else\"\n\nYes, because as a survey company we should really be manipulating data anyways. \n\nTldr; Work at a survey company, had to manipulate data format, said I was uncomfortable because there are potentially too many errors, gets called an insubordinate.",

FML. \n\nSomeone reached out to me because their organization was hosting an event, and they needed a program for this event. I’d never freelanced before, but I agreed to do it because I love money and bills needed to be paid. So I said I’d do their program for $150. But then I also agreed to do the Powerpoint that they presented at the awards ceremony. And the banners for their sponsors. And their wine sponsor labels. And I showed up to help set up for the Powerpoint prior to the awards ceremony.  I would venture to say that I spent well over 60 hours on this project at what should have been at least $25 an hour.  But nothing was ever in writing. I was too much of a pussy to press the issue. I ended up getting paid $250 for EVERYTHING that I did. *face palm*\n\nOK. Fast forward. I get a REALLY GOOD job shortly thereafter. Today, I get an email today from the organizer of the event that read “Hope your job is going well.  We would still love for you to put our program and PowerPoint together this year.  Let me know if you are interested in helping this year.”\n\nI responded “Last year, I had the burden of unemployment and bills to pay, and $4.16 an hour was a welcome relief at the time. But this year, I'm faced with so many deadlines where I'm working now, I don't think I'll be able to fit it into my schedule. Thank you for thinking of me, though!”\n\n\n\n\n",

Explanatory commentary by me in parentheses. Maybe some of you can relate to my frustration.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n10:07 PM Desktop View successfully initiated.\n\n10:07 PM Tommy: I can hear you and would appreciate quiet please\n\n10:08 PM Proctor: It seems you're still connected to your previous proctor as well as me. One moment. I'll borrow your mouse and we'll fix that for you!\n\n10:08 PM Tommy: Yes I can hear him complaining about another student with someone - very disruptive\n\n10:09 PM Proctor: Sometimes the software does not disconnect properly. I'll get it fixed for you.\n\n\n(I am now fixing his issue which involves going to the video tab he has open and hitting the refresh button and a couple other things. In all, it's about 5 clicks and usually takes about 1-2 minutes to complete, given the loading times, which can be slow if the test taker has ComCast or another comparably sucky ISP. However, when I get his feed back up, I am required to check and make sure it's working. This is where things start to head south. As I'm still in this process, he attempts to navigate back to his test, which I do not allow, since I still have remote access to (read: control over) his computer. With one more click everything seems to be up. Now I speak, asking if he can hear me.)\n\n\n10:09 PM Tommy: This is a timed test. Quit\n\n10:10 PM Proctor: I have to make sure your video is running properly, sir. Your institution requires me to proctor you with video as well as audio.\n\n10:11 PM Tommy: I'm in the middle of my test I need to take the test\n\n10:11 PM Tommy: You don't have the ability to give me more time\n\n\n(I hear a slight echo of my own voice in his video, letting me know he can hear me, whether he wants to cooperate or not.)\n\n\n10:11 PM Proctor : I'm bound by the proctoring requirements of your institution, but your video feed seems to be working. You may continue your exam.\n\n10:11 PM Tommy: OK what do we need to do you have already cost me at least 5 minutes\n\n\n(He continues typing to me and not doing his test, because time is of the essence.)\n\n\n10:11 PM Proctor: I will notate your time los in the institution's notes, so you are not penalized.\n\n10:11 PM Proctor: loss\n\n10:12 PM Tommy: I don't hear you\n\n10:12 PM Tommy: lost time note will not help\n\n\n(Because his institution pays out the ass for our proctoring service so they can NOT read our reports.... Suuuuure. We get near-constant feedback about our reports from partnered institutions.)\n\n\n10:12 PM Proctor: You may continue your exam.\n\n\n(Since he didn't the last time I said it and took it upon himself to waste 3 more minutes of his own testing time trying to argue about his own institution's requirements.)\n\n\n\n(A while later, luckily with no further contact from him. Silence is golden!)\n\n\n10:35 PM Tommy: I'm Done\n\n10:35 PM Proctor: Alright. Great! One moment, please.\n\n10:36 PM Proctor: Alright. You may close the test window.\n\n10:36 PM Tommy: done\n\n10:37 PM Proctor: Next, I'll need to see you log out of [Academic Courses Website] .\n\n\n(He just closes the tab, rather than doing as instructed. Sometimes this does auto-log-out, but sometimes it doesn't. Thus, we're required to have test takers ACTUALLY use their website's \"log/sign out\" function, so the institutions can be sure that there is no further access to the test available to the test-takers.)\n\n\n10:37 PM Proctor: I must witness you actually click the \"Log out,\" or \"Sign out\" button, rather than just closing the tab, as required by your institution.\n\n10:37 PM Tommy: It is not open - closed with the other proctor - all I have open is [Proctoring Company Name] and [Academic Courses Website] and you just told me to get out of [Academic Courses Website] which I did\n\n10:38 PM Proctor: Alright, then I'll need you to reopen and make sure you're logged out before we can continue.\n\n\n(He reopens the tab and it jumps to the \"log-in page,\" which is verification that it auto logged him out, so the requirements are satisfied and I try to respond so he knows we can continue.)\n\n\n10:38 PM Proctor: okay great!\n\n10:38 PM Proctor: Thank you!\n\n\n(However, because he was pitching a verbal fit about having to reopen the tab, he neglected to read my chat and actually logs back into the website.)\n\n\n10:38 PM Proctor: Oh, I only needed to see that you were not actively logged in, which I saw at the log-in page.\n\n10:39 PM Tommy: I'm logged in close the tab?  There is no log out button on this page\n\n10:39 PM Proctor: However, you may now use the little \"power symbol\" button in the top right corner of this tab to log out.\n\n\n(Clicking this takes him to a page that reads, \"YOU HAVE BEEN LOGGED OUT\" in giant letters, serving to rustle his jimmies even further.)\n\n\n10:39 PM Proctor: Perfect! Thank you.\n\n10:39 PM Tommy: Can you see that?\n\n\n(Rage-enduced chat-ignoring continues)\n\n\n10:39 PM Proctor: Yes. Thank you.\n\n10:39 PM Proctor: You have now completed your session.\n\n10:40 PM Tommy: This has been the most disrespectful proctoring session Ihave ever had - I need to file a complaint and will do so with [Test-taker's University].\n\n10:40 PM Proctor: You may end the session by closing the video page and chat box. Thank you for using [Proctoring Company Name] and have a great night!\n\n10:40 PM The customer ended the session.",

        "text": "I am a landlord. My family owns a small property management company and we manage rental houses for private investors. We're a pretty small operation, and most days I'm the only person in the office so I field all the calls and complaints. Yay! \n\nLast month an irate gentleman came in to the office waving some sort of fraud paperwork in my face and asking if I remembered him. I didn't. Turns out he was a former tenant who rented from my company about 5 years ago. He then launched into a long and complicated story about how his identity had been stolen by somebody who signed up for a pre-approved credit card in his name. However, the address they used on the credit card application was the address of the house he'd rented from us 5 years ago. So obviously it was my fault. Armed with his fraud letter and a collection of choice 4 letter words, he had come to get me to fix it. \n\nStill trying to wrap my mind around the problem, I asked him if he'd filed a fraud report with his bank. He said yes, the card had been closed and no money had been stolen because his bank caught it in time. \n\"Ok, what are you hoping I can do for you?\" I asked cautiously. Former Tenant replied \"I was HOPING that you would do something to fix this. I thought you would feel some sense of responsibility here. This is my money and YOUR TENANT tried to steal from me! They used the rental address so it has to be the people living there!\" \n\nOhhhh, that makes more sense. He thinks the current tenant got some of his mail and applied for the card. I explained that I can't give out tenant information for no reason, but if there was an investigation going on he should have the authorities contact me so I could give them any relevant info. He told me \"There's no investigation because they didn't steal any money, but I know it's them. You have to do something. They can't just go around taking things from people like that! What are you going to do about it?! This is your company and you're letting them get away with this?\" Oh lordy. He's loud and angry and I have no idea how to help him, so I finally said \"I'm not really sure what I can do to help you. I could call the tenants and ask if they'd received any of your mail, but if they did try to steal your identity they wouldn't just admit to it. Honestly, this seems like more of a civil issue that doesn't really involve us. I'd need some kind of proof before I could take any action on my end.” \nWrong move. \n\nHe starts going off on “What do you mean you don't know how to help me?! Of course this #&amp;$*%(^&amp;# involves you! It's your company! Just deal with the *&amp;%#$@(%* tenants or I'm going to call the police!” Any time he pauses for breath I just keep interjecting “I'm not sure how to help you. Let me talk to the property manager when she comes in and we'll figure out what we can do.” After about a half hour of back and forth he finally realizes I legitimately don't know what to do, so he leaves after a few passive-aggressive parting shots about how I should feel bad that my company is screwing innocent people over. \n\nOnce he leaves, I look up the tenant information and find there's only been 1 tenant in the house since he moved out 5 years ago. Since the fraud happened only a couple weeks ago, it's not terribly likely that his mail was still going to the rental address, but who knows. He came in the next day and we went through almost exactly the same exchange again. I told him we needed proof because I can't just evict somebody on hearsay. In the meantime, if he wanted to contact the police we'd be happy to provide any information they needed. Finally the property manager got time to talk to him, and told him the same things I'd been saying all along. \n\nHe was not a happy camper, but seriously, what did he expect me to do? \n\nTL;DR Angry guy thinks my tenant stole his identity. Has no proof, but wants me to evict said tenant on his word. I can't; he gets angrier. ",

They always refuse to buy tanning lotion.\n\n\nWell this guy has one of the highest memberships. $110/month. It allows him to use all of the tanning beds as well as all of the spray tan machines. He also pays his memberships with gift cards. I'm pretty sure he was some sort of scammer.\n\n\nAnyways, one night he comes in, requests and extra towel and the same bed he always uses to tan \"because it has the loudest stereo.\" If warning bells are going off for you, good.\n\n\nI have to preface this a bit. Our radio in the stores sucked. They were terrible. And the way the walls were built, they didn't go all the way to the ceiling. The only rooms that had drop ceilings were the bathrooms, laundry room, and spray tan rooms, so if someone turns the room speaker up too loud, the entire store can hear it, even over the fans on the tanning beds. The machine involve in this story has an Aux input cable built into it so you don't have to listen to our shitty taste in music.\n\n\nWell, I send this dude on his way and he starts the bed. Within the first 30 seconds of him being in the bed, his phone is hooked up, with both the device and bed volumes turned ALL. THE. WAY. UP. For 12 minutes, I had to listen to a mixture of Nickleback and Kidd Rock while this asshole tanned.\n\n\nThankfully, he leaves after what feels like an eternity and I go to clean the bed after I finish up some other nightly duties. Now, some people just sweat a lot. It's not a big deal. Every tanning salon I've worked at uses medical grade sanitizer to clean the acrylic. This dude happened to sweat a lot and I noticed the puddle first. Then I notice the towels. I fucking hate folding towels. I especially hate it when (most) people request extra towels.\n\n\nThen...

        "text": "Hello this is M3. By day, I work middle-management and by night I work at a coffee shop.\n\n\nA good part of my job is printing reports for people in my department and other departments to use.  When I arrive at work, it's basically the first thing I do - print reports and place them in the file cubby thing so people can take them whenever they need it.  However, if we are a bit more busy than usual, Boss will come in a little earlier and print out some of the reports.  I still don't understand why she does this, it just takes away stuff for me to do.  \n\nThis past weekend was one such busy weekend.  I walk into work this morning and glance at the file cubby across the room.  Looks like there's one report dangling from the cubby.  I sit down and start printing reports.  When I'm halfway done, the other supervisor walks up to my desk and tells me that Boss has already printed the reports from the weekend.  Boss's desk is two feet away from my desk.  She is just sitting there staring at her monitor.  Not saying a word.  I walk over to the file cubby and grab that one dangling report.  It is about one-fifth of all the completed reports.  I put on my best calm face, and walk over to her desk, \"Hey Boss, do you have the other reports too or should I print them out?\"  She looks up at me as if she didn't hear a word of my and other supervisor's discussion and tells me, \"Oh, I printed some of the reports, here you go.\"  And she hands me about another three-fifths of the reports.  I look through them and per usual she has formatted them incorrectly and highlighted the wrong things.  Through my sigh I ask her for the remaining reports.  She replies, \"Oh I got busy, so you can print the rest.\"\n\n\nFFFfffffffff!\n\n\nA small problem with the reports is that you look them up through batches and print them with batches.  It's much more efficient if I just sit and print them all at once.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I’ve never felt the need to share my experiences online. But I’m still so baffled and appalled by this asshat. \nI work reception at a small veterinary clinic in North America, and paperwork aside- I really do enjoy my job, my co-workers, and our regular clients. I’m super bubbly, easy to work with, and eager to make a customer happy—but this guy… I literally can’t say anything civil about.\n\n\nBackground before the start of my shift: \nA family calls at 8:00am sharp (opening hour) with an emergency situation. My co-worker pulls up the file, and a BIG RED pop-up alerts her that these clients once owed us $400+, and it took several months of reminders and stern phone conversations to actually get them to pay us the full amount. \nSo that’s a warm fuzzy…\n\n\nThe owner (who will now be referred to as O) explains over the phone that her dog has been in labor since 5pm last night, and needs to be seen by a vet. My co-worker immediately adds her to the schedule and tells her to head straight for our clinic, as this is considered life threatening. My manager makes up an estimate for an emergency C-section, and the techs in back begin prepping for an unscheduled, intensive surgery. Minutes go by and O’s arrive (teen daughter and mother) along with a tiny, terrier-mix, dog. In the O’s defence (hardly…) the dog seemed very alert and responsive, even after being in labor for 15+ hours. My techs asked if the O had called the veterinary emergency hospital, after they noticed no puppies were passing from labor. \n\n\nO said yes, she called at 3 a.m. and they told her to wait until morning. (We work VERY closely with the emerge clinic, and we are certain this is a lie. They would have told her to come in immediately. Our theory is: being a 24hr clinic, emerge is expensive and they didn’t want to pay for this. So they instead decided to risk waiting until morning for a general practice to open.)\n\n\n My manager didn’t press the matter and showed her the estimate and began to go over the procedure my doctor would be performing to save their dog, and hopefully the puppies. My manager also asked for a deposit, as it was an emergency, walk-in surgery.\n\n \nO was appalled at the price and the request for a deposit. The emergency C-Section with full IV fluids, monitoring, medication, and pain management ranged from $1700-2300. (It’s a lot—I get it, I really do. I can’t afford a pet myself, and try to sympathise as best I can with clients. But people, you gotta think before getting a pet—let alone BREEDING ONE!) The O proceeds to spew insults at my manager, how we’re “all about the money,” how we “don’t really care about the animals,” etc etc…\n\n\nMy manager tells O there is nothing she can do—they can either decide as a family to surrender the pet (at no charge) so we can begin surgery and providing care, or they have to pay for their pet’s medical needs.\nO threatens to leave, and my manager tells her very clearly that if she leaves without providing care for her animal (care the animal needs because the O stupidly tried to breed the poor thing, and then let the dog suffer through 15+ hrs of labor!!!) that she would report the O for negligence. The dog was lucky to still be alive.\n\n\nO bitches some more—pays the deposit of $1700 (the very LOW end of the estimate) and storms out of the clinic.\nI arrive and get filled in on the situation, while my doctor is in back performing surgery. My doctor had all hands on deck- we had to cancel appointments, and the doctor had to call her husband into clinic to assist in resuscitating puppies.\n\n\nX-rays show 5 puppies; one stuck in the birthing canal. (Turns out the O bred her small female with a larger male, as the puppies’ heads were 30mm in diameter, and the birthing canal’s opening was only 25mm wide….. well done Back-yard Breeder.) \n\n\nAfter several minutes of surgically opening the dog- my doctor discovers the uterus has essentially collapsed, has had blood circulation cut off, and was slowly dying/spilling out—along with the 5 puppies inside. She removed the entire uterus, and the second doctor along with her technicians had to take over with the puppies, while my first doctor continued trying to save the mother. \n\n\nI’m manning phones, and the front desk- checking in back, desperately wishing I could help. Both technicians, a fellow receptionist, the second doctor, and the first doctor’s husband, each have a puppy they are desperately trying to resuscitate. I get called over to prep epinephrine, after 45 minutes of little to no signs of life. \nRoughly 2 hours pass—doctor one is still in surgery saving the mother, and only one puppy is barely showing signs of life. Finally after another 10-15 minutes, the staff rejoices to hear the angry squeaks and whimpers from the only surviving puppy, finally breathing on her own. My first doctor manages to save the mother as well—we get her all sutured up, and before long she is set into a blanketed kennel with her new pup, who is eagerly nursing. \nThe day continues fairly normally, aside for the occasional angry squeaks from the new born puppy learning to suckle.\n\n\nMy doctor calls O’s and tells them both the tragic, and heartwarming news. We tell O that we will monitor through the day and the dog and pup could go home around 5 p.m. \nLater my doctor tries to call O after the bill has been finalized, but gets no answer. There is a remaining balance of approximately $400 (as they only paid the low end of the estimate).\n\n\n5 p.m. rolls around and daughter comes in to pick up her dog and pup. We explain the remaining balance, and she is surprised. She tells us her mom never got the message and would be very upset. Instead of getting her mom from the parking lot (who is still irate and infuriated with us), she calls her dad to pick up the dogs after he finishes work at 6 p.m. The daughter tells my manager her father would pay upon pick up.\n\n\n6 p.m. rolls around, and I’m at the till typing notes. A gentleman walks in, and I smile and greet him, “I’ll be right with you sir, I’ll just be a second.” \n\nHe steps to the side of the counter, and I manage to hit 4 keys before he puts his hands down and says abruptly, “Nope. Nope- no, I’m here for my dog.” He begins to walk behind the counter—\n\nShocked, I stammer, “Sir—sir? Sir please stop—,”\n“No—I need to get my dog.” He proceeds past my counter into our treatment room.\n\nI follow, “Sir, I need you to stop- is there something I can help you with?? Sir--!” My manager looks up at me, shocked- my two doctors, holding a loose cat for vaccines, are frozen in shock as well. \n\n“What’s going on?” my manager asks.\n\n“I- I don’t know—he won’t stop--,”\n\nMy manager dismisses me to return up front. I glance back and see him opening the dog’s kennel, and my two doctors racing to stop him. I close the door to the back treatment room and try to regain my composure. I hear yelling, mumbled words, more yelling, and then my heart stops as I hear the most pitiful squeak---\n\n\nI begin to panic, not knowing what to do—I turn to see my manager escorting him off the property, with a box in his arms and some towels. \nI dash in back to see my doctor in tears, and my staff completely shell-shocked. I cautiously asked what happened, and my doctor tells me: the gentleman marched back into the kennel room, ignored orders to stop what he was doing—lifted the dog and towels out of the kennel (almost ripping her sutures out) and in doing so—he had dropped the new born pup from almost 4ft high… (That had been the terrifying squeak I had heard while up front….)\n\n\nThankfully, my doctor caught the pup, before she died on impact—but he proceeded to call my doctor a “butcher,” and tell her how she murdered his puppies and maimed his dog, and how she and all of her staff were despicable low-lives and degenerates only interested in money… \n\n\nI’m still in shock—this is a first for our clinic, and we now have a new policy in place to immediately call 911 if EVER anyone enters treatment against an employee’s word… But we still haven’t been fully paid… and we have NO idea if the puppy is even alive still… The O’s are being sent to collections next week.\nI’ve never felt so stupid and helpless and infuriated.\n\n\nPlease: SPAY and NEUTER you pets- there are dogs and puppies in shelters, we don’t need anymore! DON’T be STUPID backyard breeders. DON’T wait 15+hrs after labor to seek veterinary help. And DON’T almost murder a new born pup (that took 3 hrs to save) through ignorant actions!!! Don’t be an idiot--- or at least, if you’re going to be an idiot, DON’T OWN PETS!!! Ugh…\n",

        "text": "(x-posted from /u/TailesFromRetail 'cause I didn't know about this sub till just now...)\n\nThis happened last year at the tailor shop that I now own.\n\nAn old man brought in about 8 panels sheer drapes (the worst kind) he started right out by telling me all about how he used to make drapes for a living, but had sold his sewing machine years ago and that was why he was coming to me or else he would totally be doing this by himself.\n\nThere was about 75ft of width between many, many panels. At the time, I hadn't yet started charging per panel, but by the previous owners metric of 'per foot in width.' I have learned that when you say any price followed by 'per foot' the customer starts panicking about what the cost -might- be and it is safer to say 'per panel.' The most time consuming part of hemming drapes is getting them all laid out and measured accurately which is what most of the cost is for. The actual sewing of the hem is really fast and easy in comparison... and sadly, the only part that the customers actually think about when they want to get them hemmed. 'It is so easy, you just sew straight across!' is what many people think.\n\nHe was in a hurry after telling his story and didn't want to stand around while I measured this massive pile of fabric. I said, \"How about I measure it after you've gone, figure out the price and give you a phone call to let you know how much it would cost. Then you can can decide if you want to go ahead with it or not. I wouldn't do anything until you've made your choice.\" The dry cleaner I work with does this a lot. Their customer brings them a mending/alteration job and they send it along to me with a 'call with price' note and then I can call the customer to say what it would be and if they want me to do it or just send it back.\n\nHe said that seemed okay... and then said, \"So what would it be in the ballpark of? Like thirty dollars?\" ... THIRTY DOLLARS? Are you freaking kidding me? It took all I had not to laugh in his face. I told him no... typically for sheer drapes the cost has always been $5.99 per foot in width. Sheer fabric is a little more difficult to work with both to measure/mark accurately and to sew without snagging/bunching so it gets the highest price. However, I would be willing to give him the price for unlined drapes ($3.99/ft) since he had so much and people like hearing that they are getting a deal.\n\nHis eyes bugged out of his skull. He couldn't believe it. \"People actually pay that much?!\" Yes they do. \"But all you have to do is fold it up to here (he points) and sew it across. Thankfully his drapes were already cut, they just needed to be folded up 1/2\" then again by 1.25\" and sewn across. I had no other customer at the time so he kept going on and on about how I was charging sooooooo much.\n\nI was such a push over. I told him that since the case was such that I wouldn't have to spend all that extra time measuring and cutting, that I would just charge him for my time (to think of price for things, the original owner -aka master tailor- said that you should charge $1 for every minute you had to spend on something... I didn't tell the customer the scale by which I determined price) so the price would be more like $50, take it or leave it. He begrudgingly decided to give me his information. He then said that he didn't want to pay until he picked up just incase I \"screwed it up\" because how could he know if I'd do a good job or not!\n\nI sucked it up and said fine, then if next week was good for pick up (I like asking one week turnaround so I can schedule things nicely) but no no no, he had to have it on Friday (it was currently Tuesday). I figured I'd have time to squeak it in if I came in extra early one morning and I just wanted him to leave so I said okay.\n\nI did those damned drapes. Even added little weights to each one at the two bottom corners like sheers should have so they don't flap wildly in the breeze (these didn't originally have them since he cut them himself and probably lost them). I pressed the hems ONLY since that has always been shop practice plus there is no space to press the entirety of drapes, folded them neatly and had them ready to go at 9:30 Friday morning. I even adjusted the price as I input it into the computer to be exactly $50 after GST even though it had taken about 60 minutes... just 'cause I didn't want him to whinge that I had quoted him $50 so why is it now higher?\n\nHe showed up the next Wed/Thurs or something like that. Asked if I had pressed all the wrinkles out (he had brought them to me all balled up in a garbage bag) so I said that I did my best and even weighted them. \"Well good, you are supposed to do that.\" I bit my tongue and asked for the $50. He pointed at a sign in my window and I cringed. \"I dropped these off on a Tuesday. Your sign says 10% off for seniors on Tuesday. Did you apply that?\" ... No. Not only does the sign also state that you must give me one week and you demanded them to be ready in 3 days, which they were even if you didn't come for them, but I had pretty much already discounted between $250 and $400 on these things. I told him how much of a discount he was getting too.\n\nHe angrily shoved his credit card at me \"I can't believe you are robbing people like this!!!\" Yeah, well you didn't have to choose to get them done by me. Payment goes through and I put his receipt in the bag and wish him a great afternoon. He snatches the bag and marches out while grumbling \"I am never coming here again!\"\n\n... And I never saw him again. Also, I kept an eye on my bank in case he decided to be a dick and reverse the charge, which he didn't thank goodness.\n\nLesson learned. I am not such a pushover now. Guys like him can go hang. I am desperate for work, but not that much.",

        "text": "I don't know if this is the best /r/ for me to post this in, it seemed fitting to me though.\n\nBackground: I'm a receptionist at the service department of *Car Dealership*. I answer phone calls and make appointments. Anything complicated I usually just send over to one of my Service Advisors.\n\nPhone Call: A woman calls asking about an Urgent Recall notice that we send out whenever someone has a recall on their car and doesn't bring it in. First she starts off with saying she never got the first notice. I'm still a little bit knotted up about this so I'm not going to format this in dialogue, just going to summarize it.\n\nBasically, what happens is sometimes the HQ of *Car Dealership* prints out old information that no longer applies to certain customers. The place I work at is privately owned. Although we work with the HQ, we are NOT the HQ. We do not control the printing of information. The recall notices are sent out based on that information.\n\nThis woman, as it turned out, no longer owned the car that this notice is for. So, just as I tell every other customer that has this issue, I told her that she can disregard this notice. She then continues to question why we had sent out this card with wrong information on it (as it is handwritten). I say, just like always, we do not control the information being printed. I then offer her a number to HQ to get her name and no-longer owned car off the list.\n\nShe then begins to chew me out, asking me if we'll pay her to do that (sarcastically) because it's \"our job\" to handle whether she's on the list or not. I keep trying to insist that it's simply not my job to call HQ about it. I do what I'm told, I'm just the f*cking receptionist.\n\nThen she continues to say \"I've been working in sales for years\" and goes on and on about how *Car Dealership* is acting like a herd of sheep, and not the \"leader\". Which, is literally what we are. We're not a leader business, we literally follow guidelines and rules from HQ.\n\nShe continued to berate me and chew me out for something that is not in my control, repeating the same lines she was using earlier. She finally decided to hang up, but not before telling me \"Actually, I think I WILL call HQ. Have a nice day.\"\n\nI was so frustrated and angry that I started crying. This is something that happens to me, not necessarily because I'm sad. Whenever I get an overflow of any emotion, I cry. But I'm at work (even while typing this) and I can't cry on the job. So I ran to the bathroom. My stomach is still in knots over this.\n\nI really don't like working with people, I belong with animals working with them. I want to be a dog trainer. This job is out of necessity and I have to deal with it, obviously. I needed to vent about this, I'm still really upset. Sorry if something doesn't make sense or if this is sloppy.",

They go through the wash (touchless auto wash) and about ten minutes after she went through, she comes up to me and asks for some tire shine. \nI asked her to show me her receipt, she didnt have one and didnt ask for one when she should have either. So i looked at her tires and they were bone dry (the tire shine is applied automatically albeit liberally in the car wash tunnel) and i told her i could not give her tire shine without proof of purchase. \n(That's the company policy and i uphold it because my management is very strict, and i didn't want to have to deal with any disciplinary consequences.)\nShe gets uppity and starts cursing at me blah blah blah. She calls her son over to \"verify\" her purchase. After i said once more she wouldn't be getting tire shine, and stated that it really wasn't that big of a deal for her to be making such a scene over something so insignificant. Her son said \"if it's not a big deal, then why not give her some tire shine?\" \n(I would have completely ignored her son if he hadn't taken a step towards me in a \"threatening\" manner while he said it.) At this point i realized this 16-18 y/o kid was \"out for blood\" so i told him point blank \"don't step to me like that.\" Of course that sends him over the edge and reaches in his pocket and pulls out...\n\n\n\nhis wallet, and throws it on the hood of my car. I replied to this indignant action by saying \"don't throw your shit on my car.\" \nSo now i knew this kid was about to do something stupid.\nSure enough, he winds all the way up movie style (twisted his hips and shoulders, all that) and punched me in the face... I had to consciously think about what to do next, and then it hit me. (pun intended?...) i turned my head back to face him and laughed! \nThen i asked him and his mom and little friend to leave the property and not come back. (They left pretty quickly surprisingly, still huffing and puffing.)\n\n\nI was shocked that he punched me in the face over some tire shine...come on now really? \nIf all that wasn't enough...he punched like a BITCH! I literally have been hit harder by my ten month old daughter. And i promise i am not exaggerating in the slightest bit.",

        "text": "Forgive me if this is the wrong place for this story. If there is a more specific place to post, do let me know and I will take it there!\n\nSo, I work at a funeral home. It's a wonderful job and I really love where I work. We do a lot to take care of families in a way that the other funeral businesses in our area don't. For example, we own our cemetery and it's on the same property as our office. Great place for people who don't go to church to be buried. But anyway, this is about the cemetery. Our office and cemetery close at 8pm everyday. It sucks, but it's what we have to do. I'll be the first to tell you that people don't care about others and their loved ones' graves. I've seen jerks drive over graves in their car and leave tire marks without a care in the world.  If you leave cute little trinkets out, they're going to get stolen. So, we lock up when the closing staff leaves because we don't want someone's stuff getting ruined in the night, when we have no one to watch over everything. \n\nIt's 8:30pm, a whole half hour after I was supposed to close. I had done my drive around the cemetery to find people visiting and let them know I would be closing the gates. We have two separate gates; one for entering and one, with a stop sign, for leaving. The last family is waiting to pull out, our entrance gate is locked, and I am standing literally right next to the exit gate when Mr. \"I know you're locking up but I need to visit this person right this very second\" pulls in at a speed higher than necessary through our exit, nearly hitting both the family trying to leave and little old me in the process. I got back in my car to go politely ask him to leave. Of course, when I found him he was at the grave talking to his loved one, so I let him be for the good two minutes he was there. \n\nTwo. Minutes.\n\nMaybe this was his only chance to visit, maybe he had driven clear across the country (we get a lot of those people trying to visit when we're trying to close), who knows. But, was that two minutes really worth nearly causing a big fat accident? \n\nWhy don't people check when places close and plan accordingly? Why don't people use their context clues and decide that maybe right now is not the right time to visit?\n",

        "text": "A bit of a background: I was in acrobatic aerobics from the age of 7. It was very fun at first, but then all my friends leaft and I became lonely.  Also, everybody had a pair or a (three person group?) to dance with,  but there was no one in my age category, which meant I was going to dance alone.  I wanted to leave but my mom encouraged me to stay because it would leave me fit,  and I will have an easier (and better paid, I guess) job in the military, so I stayed. \n\nWe had the directress-an old russian woman,  two trainers,  and three semi-trainers(I call them semi trainers because they are not yet 18,  so they are not getting paid for it, but aside from this,  they are legitimately trainers). One of the trainers had quit,  because she got a job, I was told.  The other was getting a degree in sports medicine,  so she got very little time on her hands to be a trainer. One of the semi trainers had finals,  the other one quit because she got in an argument with the directress and the last one just vanished (there was a rumor he was involved in a rape case, but it's kinda hard to belive it,  especially because a classmate told me she saw him a month ago.) So there was almost no one left to train the 20 teammates I had in the group. Then , the derectress told me I was going to be a semi-trainer in  the next year. I had no training skills, I was very irresponsible (I missed a lot of lessons), and learnd very slowly. Also, my skills at sports were in a lag for my age and experience, so I couldn't be a good example for the kids I thought.  But I couldn't refuse, because I knew the derectress also couldn't do it. She was too old to show on herself some of the elements and had no time to  teach. She was too occupied with the events whe had throughout the year. And then there was this huge event where she couldn't care at all for our team,  just because there were so many teams in this event. \n \nFrom the nightmare of counting down the minutes i have left to the end of the lesson, it became real life hell in the first month. In the first two minths It took the most stress and guilt out of me in my life. The derectress could have done a great job of teaching me of how to be a good semi-trainer,  if only she knew how to teach slow and difficult people like me. I was getting used to the new schedule of not missing any of my lessons, because if the teacher is absent ,there is no lesson. I had to come before everyone,  and that meant I had to ask to leave school earlier. There were kids who came like half an hour earlier,  so I had to come an hour earlier before the lesson has begun.  I couldn't interest the kids(and some adolescents.  I forgot I also trained newbies older than me) when I trained them. I basically just passed them my experience of a sports lesson, that sports are boring and we are just passing time here, and I just couldn't manage them, because kids don't like being bored.  I also hadn't had the right eye to judge someone's dance quality,  so instead of training someone over and over again,  giving them tips and advices,  I just focused on the kids who danced better; they were usually the ones who asked for more checking of their dances, and that's what I did.  Once I was required to help a little girl how ro do a bridge (if that's how it's called in English) and she squirmed in my hands and i almost dropped her on her head, and after that experience I just thought about not coming back. Ever. But I came back. There were many other times when kids got traumas in their legs and arms, but I just couldn't take the responsibility all the time.  I knew I had to give them some ice, or put a stretch band on their limbs,  but I was scared to go all the time to the first aid kit, because it meant I had to go through the derectress office,  and she would see how many kids got hurt during my time with them. I had nightmares where i was chased and where I killed strangers with a chanesaw, but they were gone after a month. \n\nThen the sports- medicine learning trainer just completely stopped coming, so I got her responsibilities too.  After I was done training the kids,  I had to train middle aged women.  I was horrible at it. Most of the exercise they did them selves, from what they rememberd,  and I just repeated after them. They hated me(, shocker).  I had no life in this point.  I had only one friend left,  because she learned in the same class as me. Those were just cycles of school, unpaid job,  sleep.  I lost hope. I was trying to get an advice from the most beloved sports medicine studying trainer, and she told me to get my assertiveness and start shouting when required.  It didn't fit my character,  and kids began seeing me as mean. Oh, and I almost had no time to do some sports myself. In the end wanted to talk to some mother I trusted from the parent committee about my desire to leave.  Instead of supporting me, she just started shoving me her Jewish bullshit; that if I leave this club of feminine dance,  I might start becoming musculine, and than I may even become gay, and being gay is immoral because God.  I just began crying.  At one point I got the courage to tell the derectress to leave. And that's how I realized I really wanted to quit a dance club I was in for 7 years, because of four months of hell. \n\n\n*TL;DR* I got an unpaid job out of the blues, where I was a total disaster to my employer,  hurt some kids on the way,  and lost my personal life.",

        "text": "This might go without saying, but I pick up a lot of rocks at the Rock Factory. Sometimes six thousand a shift. Sometimes eight tons a shift. Even though I'm a machine operator, I definitely work with my hands, and it shows in the various cuts, blisters, and callouses that I end up with. This is the story of how one of those callouses became a pretty gross practical joke on Redwood, my direct supervisor.\n\nI originally got a blister five days before this story's events. I didn't pop it, so it ended up just forming a huge callous over the area that wasn't actually attached to the skin underneath, and I'd managed not to tear it up until this particular day. Sadly, one edge finally started to tear, and I ripped most of it off in one piece. I was just about to throw it away when I realized that I still owed Redwood a prank from something he'd done a while ago. Instead of tossing it, I put it on a corner of my desk.\n\nMuch later in the day, Redwood comes over. In this stage of our industrial process, I was finishing calibrating the machine, and needed to measure the output and show it to Redwood for approval. I run the machine and set the prototype down, turn around to grab a ruler, and when I turn around he's already looking at the quality of it. This is sort of annoying to me, because we need to measure the position before we worry about the parts of it that Red is checking.\n\n\"Can I see that rock real quick?\" I ask him. He just ignores me, looking at the rock. I can tell by the way that he's ignoring me that he's just messing with me, but I give him a few seconds to bask before I tell him, \"Give me that rock.\" He just still keeps ignoring me. No smile or anything. Usually the third time, he'll break, so I yell, \"For fucks sake, will you give me that goddamn rock!?\" Still nothing... and then I remember what's on my desk.\n\nI turn around and grab it, and he sets down the rock. Too late for me to call of retribution. Holding my skinflake in my fingers in a clear \"hold out your hand and accept this\" gesture while shielding it from view, I kept my gaze focused on my hand. \"What's that?\" he asks, and I ignore him. He sticks out his hand, palm up, and accepts it. \"What IS that?\" he asks, inspecting it closer. I grin and show him my [thumb](http://i.imgur.com/T1wi7of.jpg). He quickly puts the pieces together in his mind.\n\nHis reaction is priceless, and made me really appreciate how close the emotional response to fear and to being grossed out are. Even though he was just holding it in his fingers, he brings both of his hands back over his shoulders, as well as taking a step back. He managed to even throw it in the trash can. He says something about how much he hates me, then we all laugh about it. Someone tells a related story, and the rest of the shift goes on.\n\nAlthough that's where this story ends, something happened later that I think might be coming up in a future episode. While Redwood was talking about some future roster changes, he told me one that would affect my line that I did not like. See, Onions figured his shit out and got on Adderall, and now I truly think that he's the best assistant floating around. I'd known that personnel were going to be shifting in the near future and was hoping to snag him for my line. However, Redwood told me that it was not to be; I would be keeping my current assistant. I could write an entire post about how much I hate working with the guy (although honestly, he's a really cool dude I have no personal problems with), but instead I'll have to promise that I'll soon be writing about my process to weed him out - ASSUMING that Redwood wasn't trying to prank me when he told me that I wasn't getting Onions. But that is for a future tale from the Rock Factory.",

And John Doe is on there too!\"    \nMe: \"No he isn't.\"\n\nWe went back and forth a bit before I finally convinced her that, no, he hadn't been added to the account.\n\nJ: \"Well, I'm still his wife. You should've just put it in the account I told you. Now I'm going to be overdrawn when my bill hits this evening! What are YOU going to do about it?\"    \nMe: \"Well, since it was a cheque, it wouldn't be available until tomorrow anyway. Any bill removed tonight would overdraw your account any way. I can't reverse it anymore, since you waited an hour to come in, and I can't withdraw it since the money isn't in your account yet.\"         \nJ: \"WE COULD'VE AVOIDED ALL THIS IF YOU JUST PUT IT IN MY ACCOUNT.\"\n\nBy now, I'm irritated, and a line is forming.\n\nMe: \"You're right; I could have. Then your bills would've come out, probably leaving you with a few hundred in the account. Then maybe you would've used your debit card for groceries and shopping. So, now you have about a hundred or so in your account. Then, the back room would've looked at the transaction, and noticed that John Doe's cheque never went into an account for John Doe. They don't know if you're his wife, or if you're a relative who stole his cheque. So they're going to say \"this was never Jane's money, we need to return a copy of the cheque so John can have his money.\" And the money for that cheque will be taken from your account. And they won't call you, and they won't care you're now overdrawn. And it'll be a week or more before that cheque is delivered.\"\n\nAt this point she's kind of shrunk a little in size.\n\nMe: \"SO! Since I deposited the money into an account with his name on it, you can just go ahead tomorrow and transfer it over into your billing account. And we won't have to worry about you losing all this money a few weeks from now, when the back room decides you have no right to it.\"\n\nEnd of the long story, she is suddenly as nice as pie, thanks me for explaining it to her, and tells me if she has any issue with the transfer, she'll get help at the branch before she goes to work.\n\nShould I have said I couldn't deposit it into the linked account? In hindsight, yes, I should have. But when you tell me to put it into the JOINT account, and there's only ONE? Bonus financial advice: if you have an ACH payment that evening, don't have only $3 in your account. A cheque won't be available immediately.",

        "text": " This summer I worked at the Boys and Girls Club, a job masquerading as an internship, for 6 weeks. For those of you who don't know what the Boys and Girls Club is, your property value might be too high.\n\n Randy is a member of this \"club,\" a 6 year old kid who took a liking to me, fuck me for trying to be empathetic because this is just the beginning of a new form of torture.\n\n Week 1. Randy comes to me and tells me some kids keep calling him \"Randy Cunningham,\" what am I supposed to do, being the namesake of a popular cartoon character isn't anybody's fault, I jsut politely told them to stop. They did for a little while, but when they started up again Randy started crying. I told him to go sit back on the bleachers, he sat on the floor(right next to an active game of Flag Football) and I told him he has to sit down. \"Why?\" \"Because you have to, it's the rules\" he goes and sits under the bleachers and starts crying. Everyday for the rest of the week he cries and runs to me because some kids make fun of him. One day during lunch, he asks if he can help. I say \"Go ask Ms.Cherry for some gloves\" he says \"No, can you go get the gloves, shes gonna say no.\" \"Well if she sees you helping, Im going to get in trouble\" \"But your staff, the other staff let kids help them\" \"Theyre my bosses\" Randy starts crying.\n\n Week 2. It's reading time, we read everyday before lunch. Randy walks up to me and asks me if he can stand up, \"No, your only supposed to be up here if you're in trouble\" \"But I want to stand\" \"No\" Randy starts crying. One day the club let in kids early, I came to work, Randy is crying again. Unexplained. I ask the kid next to him what happened, he don't know nuffin'. Everyone starts calling Randy a crybaby, I asked him if he wanted to stand next to me, he doesnt say anything and stands.\n\nWeek 3. You're seeing a pattern by now, Randy cried, let's move on.\n\nWeek 4. Randy gets a new friend and a new attitude. Introducing, Kevin, he's 7, and is a bad influence. Randy starts picking on people and generally being a nuisance under the guiding hand of Kevin, everyone's complaining, Randy gets in a fight with local bad boy Brion, Brion pushes Randy and Randy does something rather predictable. A few more days of serving lunch and watching kids play sports, Randy complains about having to follow rules and cries because he can't help with lunch, the other staff members say dont baby him and one guy picks him up and takes him to the front desk.\n\nWeek 5. I didn't see Randy for like, three full days! Then, Thursday,  Randy starts cheating at Flag Football, tying his flag and what not. So we switch to Basketball, Randy cheated at that too, every time he caught the ball he dropped on the floor and started yelling \"ball,\" so I took him out of the game, surprise, he cried. The next day he did this again.\n\nWeek Final: AKA Randy works up the nerve. Randy comes up to me while I'm on bathroom duty(sit in a chair in the bathroom and tell kids not to play in there, occasionally cleaning it.) and Randy comes up to me with a bag of gummy things, fruit snacks I think, and gives them to me, Walks away. He comes back and asks me to help. \"With what\" \"I'll watch the bathroom if you fall asleep\" \"no Randy\" \"But you're staff\"(meaningless title still) \"I can't let you help or else I'll get in trouble\" \"But you're staff\" \"My boss doesn't like when I let people help\" \"You have a boss?\" \"Yes, goodbye Randy.\" Randy does his usual routine. \"Goodbye, Randy\" \"But if I leave I have to take the gummies back.\" \"Here you go\" \"But if I take them back you'll call me mean\" \"No I wont, goodbye.\" Randy falls on the floor. A few minutes later one of my coworkers comes by and asks me whats wrong, \"He wanted to help\" \"Help do what?\" \"Exactly\" so he takes Randy back to the Gym. Later, Randy is sharing out the gummies and walks up to me and asks me if I'm still mad at him, I never acted like I was mad so this question was an obvious sign of a failed guilt trip. Some sort of calamity happens and like four kids, including Randy are fighting, we break it up and they say their \"playing\" I ignore them until my final day is over, good thing I didn't tell Randy I was leaving though.",

Maybe 35~ employees total and I'm one of the summer temps for the second year in a row.\n\nThe process of making traffic signs isn't too complicated. We have these rolls of reflective plastic in one of three sizes (45.7m x 770/960/1220mm) that we feed through a giant printer. Then we laminate the rolls and after that cut shit out with a CNC cutter.\n\nBut sometimes for some ~~odd~~ purely evil reason we're asked to just cut out the shapes straight from the unprinted rolls and ship them off to some other place to get \"painted\" with some super-thin paint. I don't question it too much even though the result usually looks like absolute shit. We've had shit come back with flies dead on the thing UNDER the paint itself and sometimes even had ones where it looked like someone took a weegie and some turpentine and dragged it across half the thing.\n\nSo for triangle \"silk prints\" we cut from 770s. The total width of the cut pattern is ~740mm. Not much space on each side left, but surely this is no problem? Oh jesus f'ing kitten-killing christ. I think for the first half hour the thing kept stopping every minute because the cutting head was moving along the sheet with such forcw that the suction in the mat of the cutter couldn't keep it still. There's a good reason that all prints we make have at the very least 2cm from each edge because this happens. Whoever thought that this was a great idea is ab asshole. Sure, I could grab a 960 roll and cut from that, but that would more than a few m^2 per roll in the trash.\n\nFuck silk prints. Especially the triangles.",

Where is it?\" he asks. I hold up the water bottle, which has been unhelpfully labelled \"GUBMINT JUICE\" for longer than I've been at High Speed. With his eye raised uncertainly at the bottle, he reached to grab it as I sprayed him in the face. \"What the F**K!\" He takes a step back, throwing his hands up with a look of betrayal and anger.\n\n\"Relax, it's only water,\" I said, grinning as I shot him again. He lowered his head and glared at me, then sighed and said, \"I hate you so f**king much.\"",

Anyhow, we get a call claiming that the toilet doesn't work. So I head out there and before I even knock on the door, I can smell something awful coming from the kitchen window. He lets me in and brings me to his kitchen sink and says, \"My toilet's broken!\" It's jammed full of urine and excrement. I ask him after a minute of being shocked at that horrible sight, \"What do you consider your sink is?\"  He brought me to his perfectly working toilet and showed what he uses for fresh water to cook and drink with.  I get my boss and call the tenant that is on the lease.      \n\nThe dude is the tenant's brother and some good charity folks from America came to his country and built a system to ensure fresh and clean water was delivered to their toilets after a hurricane and political infighting wrecked things for the people. The good charity folks forgot to help them with their drinking water situation. Since the country is too darn poor to fix it themselves, I'm sure you can imagine how that screwed up kids and people growing up there. The tenant cleaned things up and after a few months, kicked his younger brother out of his apartment when he refused to change his ways. He refused to believe clean water comes from the kitchen sink. The plumber we usually use wasn't surprised and even correctly guessed which country they came from.    \n\nI'm not going to say which country it is because I don't want to cause unnecessary drama.

        "text": "Ever had a co-worker you just wanted to slap so hard across the face you want to see it ripple in slow-motion? So confounding in their work that it made you wonder how they are still employed?\n\nI have, and we'll call him Dipstick.\n\nMany years ago I worked for an electronics repair shop. We fixed everything from TVs to home theater and car audio. I won't say I was an expert in what I did, but I certainly didn't make mistakes that cost the company money. A few years after my hire, workflow has improved so we hire Dipstick fresh out of tech school.\n\nNow that the backstory is complete, here's a **short** list of things that made me cringe, with helpful cost notes: (My labor cost excluded, I had to deal with all these)\n\n**$140.00** Dipstick forgot that the really long 3inch screws don't go in the back of a 1inch flatscreen TV. He proceeded to giggle and cover it with epoxy when I pointed it out to him. The giggling infuriated me so much I had to take an approved 1hour break.\n\n**A LOT of headache** Dipstick, for whatever reason, was formatting the boss's desktop to update to a newer OS and forgot to backup 6months of sales data. Just wiped the whole thing. Luckily, boss had home backup but still lost a week as he was getting ready to transfer it the next day.\n\n**$1,800** Dipstick broke a plasma TV screen when he left the torque on MAX for his drill. He drilled a screw in and didn't realize there was plastic wedged between the glass, proceeded to break the screen by ramming the screw down too hard. After I had just (literally 15sec before) instructed him to turn his torque down on his drill. *Fun* ensues when he dropped it on the floor as I was informing my boss.\n\n**$700** Dipstick, in the process of repairing a tuner from a board on an LCD TV, somehow broke the ribbon cable connector on two separate unrelated boards. Proceeded to cover it up with epoxy and return to cust, who returned stating that now the TV didn't turn on. Electrical taped over the epoxy and returned to cust again, who returned to us again same issue. Ended up replacing both boards out of company's pocket.\n\n**$3,000** Dipstick mislabeled a brand new under-warranty TV as scrap, proceeds to place with other scrapped sets. Warehouse guy throws out said brand new TV as, well, it was labeled scrap and with the other ones. Blames warehouse guy for not reading the label because warehouse guy has learning disability. I find now destroyed set with label that says SCRAP and comfort warehouse guy.\n\n**$500** Blows up car audio amp and speaker by hooking up wrong that customer was about to pay for. (Had money literally in hand, wanted to see it work) Not in their car mind you, at his workstation. You know, with the safety and special hookups and diagram instructing how to hook it up properly.\n\n**Headaches beyond headaches** Dipstick would intentionally not listen to me (a senior tech) and *openly tell me so*. Not because he felt I was wrong, but because I wasn't his direct supervisor nor was I given the title of supervisor. (Although it was offered) By god, I'm just trying to help out.\n\n**So much wasted time** Dipstick would constantly avoid as much work as possible by playing on his laptop while at work. There was one day my manager and I timed him. He spent 4 hours fiddling/dicking around with what we set up as a 30min job. Not that he didn't know how, he just spent 99% of his time on his laptop and bitched me out every time I checked in on him.\n\nDipstick was still working there after I quit, for a total of 4 or 5 years. I don't know how he was never fired. There were many times he was taken off anything valued over $200 due to him being a liability, and he was never allowed in a customer's home. Last I heard he was working for ComCast. -LOL!",

Each door's hinges is set to spring close and the door knobs auto locks by itself. You need to only use the key on the outside knob.   \n\nOne apartment of one section calls me up to tell me that the hallway door is difficult to open. I check it and determine that the lock has been damaged over time and possible misuse. I remove the lock and put in it's place a non locking door knob so that I can ensure each apartment has a key to the new lock prior to installing it. The owner's policy is that I am have to take back the old key from each apartment as I give them the new key. I am able to do this for 4 of the six apartments. This is what happened with the sixth apartment.  \n\nJust to clarify... this tenant is an older gentleman that seems to take pleasure in being obnoxious.  \nI call the tenant ahead of the time to ask when they will be there so I can give them the new key. We set an appointment. \nI ring his door bell and wait patiently outside his door. A few minutes go by and I decide to knock on the door. I know he's home because I saw him enter the building as I parked my car. I call his phone after a minute goes by. I can hear his phone within the apartment. He answers the phone.    \n**Tenant:** Hello?  \n**me:** Mr. XXX? I'm outside your apartment door.   \n**Tenant:** What for?  \n**me:** We set up an appointment so I can give you the key for the hallway door.   \n**Tenant:** No, I didn't!   \n**me:** Okay. Can I give you the key now?   \n**Tenant:** I'm not home!   \nI can clearly hear him as I stand outside his apartment. He sounds like he is within his living room.   \n\n**me:** When will you be home?  \n**Tenant:** When are you going to fix that hallway door!  \n**me:** What is wrong with it?  \n**Tenant:** It doesn't lock anymore! How can be safe if it doesn't lock?  \n**me:** I need to get the old key so I can give you the new key. Then I can install the new door lock.   \n**Tenant:** That's not right! How can I live in this building if the hallway door doesn't lock? I have lived in this building for twenty three years and this is simply not ACCEPTABLE!  \n**me:** I need to get the old key so I can give you the new key. Then I can install the new door lock.   \n**Tenant:** THAT DOOR DOESN'T LOCK! MAN, HOW DUMB ARE YOU?  \n**me:** I need to get the old key so I can give you the new key. Then I can install the new door lock.   \n**Tenant:** DON'T YOU YELL AT ME! I HAVE LIVED HERE FOR 23 YEARS AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN TREATED LIKE THIS!  \n**me:**  *I haven't yelled at him and I'm trying to not get into an argument with him, so I just keep my mouth shut for a while*   \n**Tenant:** WELL? Don't you have anything to say?  \n**me:**  I need to get the old key so I can give you the new key. Then I can install the new door lock. When will you be in the apartment?  \n**Tenant:** Tomorrow.  \n**me:** Or you can open the door now and I can give you the key.   \n**Tenant:** Are you deaf or just STUPID?  \n**me:** Can you please open the door, so I can give you the new key?  \n**Tenant:** I AM NOT HOME.   \n**me:** okay. At what time will you be home?  \n**Tenant:** Tomorrow at 8 PM! And Don't be late!   \n\nHe slams the phone down.  It's not a cell phone. I can hear the phone rattle in the apartment from the force of his blow. \nI walk over the hallway door and I open the door. I let the springed hinges auto-close the door. It makes a very loud sound. I then stand near his door. He opens it and then is startled by my presence.   \n\n**me:** Sir, can I have the old key so I can give the new key?  \n*He walks over the hallway door and then points at the my temporary door knob.*    \n**Tenant:** There is no lock!  \n**me:**  I need to get the old key so I can give you the new key. Then I can install the new door lock.   \n**Tenant:** THERE IS NO LOCK HERE.  \n**me:** That is temporary.   \n**Tenant:** Install the new one and then give me the key.   \n**me:**  I need to get the old key so I can give you the new key.   \n**Tenant:** I heard you the first time. Install it and then give me the key.    \n**me:** This policy isn't new. Please just give me the old key.   \n**Tenant:** THEN FIX THE DAMN LOCK!  \n\nAt this point the last apartment that I need to give the key to opens. Another rather obnoxious older man walks out and asks me what's wrong.   \n\n**me:** Sir, I am trying to replace this lock. Can you please give me the old key and I can give you the new key?  \nHe tries to argue and then his wife hits him in the back of his head, hands him the key and tells him, \"Don't be an asshole and get this over with it.\" An exchange of keys occurs and I thank him. He closes the door.   \n*I look at the Tenant. He walks back to his apartment and then looks at me.*    \n**me:** Sir, can I please get the old key now?  \n**Tenant:** I have lived here for 23 years and this is ...  \nFrom within the another apartment we hear another lady yell, \"WOULD YOU GIVE HIM THE KEY ALREADY!\"  \nTenant shakes his head and gives me the key while muttering to himself. I check to make sure it's the right key and then hand him back the key he gave me. \"That's the wrong key.\"   \n**Tenant:** WHAT? THAT IS THE RIGHT ...  \nAt this point the other five apartments all open their doors. A bunch of ladies walk up to him and tells him to stop being an asshole and give me the right key. The correct exchange of keys occurs and everyone goes back to their apartment. It takes me fifteen minutes to replace the lock &amp; ensure the door is operating properly before I leave.  \n\nJust to clarify some things, this particular tenant and a few others is the reason why the policy exists. I had changed the hallway lock before and he would spent months playing stupid games while complaining loudly that he doesn't have the key. Games like pretending he's not there or that he won't open the door after a certain time, etc. We can not just stick the key in an envelope and shove it under his door with a note explaining the situation because he will claim that he never received the key. We cannot install the lock and then wait for each tenant to come home to find a locked door. When they find that they can not enter it will create anger and irritation and in some cases, they will just break the door or lock to get past the barrier. Some will contact the super or the management, a few will break down the door and one *-guess who-* will call the city and claim that we are trying to illegally kick him out of the building. We have tired many different iterations and learned this really is the best way. He just enjoys being obnoxious.",

Then there are times when you know it's on purpose, for example:\n\nI fixed appliance for quite a while and had one lady saying the water dispenser on her fridge \"wasn't working properly.\" I get there and the damn thing is working just fine. Flow is good, not splashing everywhere, so I asked her to show me what she was talking about.\n\nShe proceeds to put the glass up to get water, but turns it 90degrees sideways before pressing the button. I kid you not, literally ------- horizontal. So, I kindly explain that gravity does not work that way and to get water into the glass you need to actually have the open part facing up, you know, to catch the water.\n\nShe insisted that since the product wasn't working to her satisfaction she demanded a new one or a full refund. It should work \"the way she wants it to\" or she won't be having it. I promptly told her to chalk it up with the warranty and have a good day, skipping right out of her house.\n\nI was the 6th person from a 3rd company over 8 separate trips to go out there for the same problem. To lay out how much money she wasted from both the warranty and the contracted companies, it would be about $700. And she didn't pay a single dime of it.",

        "text": "I work at a laser tag place. The equipment we use is fairly heavy, just slightly lighter than actual guns (or so says a friend who was in the marines says). Today, I had a session with a bunch of younger kids. I really don't like working with younger kids because they never listen to my instructions or the rules of the different games. \n\nWell, this group was a birthday party. We used to give out a free tee shirt to the birthday boy. We don't do that any more, by order of the owners. The kid thought we still did that, then threw a fit when I had to tell him we didn't. The whole session the kid just got to be more and more of a prick. Kid was a terrible shot, but always blamed either the equipment or someone else of cheating. The whole time, the kids mother takes his side, blaming everyone the little brat did. But during the middle game, where one team has to defend the central base against an endless hoard of enemies. About half way through, one of the kids runs out shouting that there was a fight. \n\nI stopped the game, and ran into the base. I could hear shouting. Sure enough, the prick was slamming the butt of the rifle into another kid's chest, yelling about cheating. I grab the gun away from him and have to drag the kid, who is now crying, out to his mother.  And then she starts yelling at me. Apparently the kid that got beat up was his brother, and it was just boys being boys. I'd have called an ambulance for the kid if my cell phone had not been dead, but as it was she was the only one with a phone. She started screeching at me when I started packing up the equipment. She went off on the whole \"I'm going to have you fired\" thing. I feel so bad for not being able to do anything. It is even worse because the kid was kind of \"cheating.\" It was a spur of the moment game, and I hadn't had time to check that everything was working right. One of the sensors on the kid's gear was out and couldn't be hit.",

The judge tells me to wait outside and then I come in after the tenant and his witness explains why they stopped paying the rent. I come in and tell them, \"They complained about the stove not working. So I checked it. I checked the oven and stove and both turned on with no problems. I asked them what was wrong and they pointed at the stove. I asked them to be please tell what's wrong and then they told me to leave the apartment. They didn't give me a reason.\"   \n**Judge:** *directed at tenant* What was wrong with the stove?   \n**tenant:** It's broken!  \n**Judge:** *directed at tenant and points at me* He just said that the stovetop and oven was working and that you didn't specify what's wrong with the stove. You haven't paid your rent for 4 months over this. So tell me, what is EXACTLY wrong with your stove.   \n**tenant:** It's dirty. They need to clean it or buy me another one.   \n**Judge:** *spends a few minutes re-reading the lease and lease rider that the owner provided.* There is nothing here that states that the owner or his employees will clean your stove.   \n**tenant:** I know LAWS! NY LAW says that they got to clean it! *she is very angry and shouts very loudly.*  \n**Judge:** Don't shout in my courtroom again. There is so no law that forces the owner to clean the property that you are currently using. The laws only state that the property must be clean and useable prior to renting, Not during.   \n**tenant:** The last building I lived in did it! They said it was a rule!  \n**Judge:** A rule for that building. A rule made by that particular owner. Is that particular owner standing over there? *He points at my Boss*  \n**tenant:** No. But I can't clean it!  \n**Judge:** Why?  \n**tenant:** XXX oven cleaner don't work!  \n**Judge:** I use that cleaner to clean my stove. How do you use it?  \n**tenant:** I spray it on and then it doesn't wipe off! The can lies!  \n**Judge:** On the back of that can is set of directions. A set of directions that my 12 year old daughter is able to read a follow to clean the stove. Are you telling me that you are incapable of doing something an average 12 year old can do?  \n**tenant:** *tenant looks angry for a few minutes while they work it out in her head.* No. Uhm, if *she points at me* that guy comes to my apartment and shows me how to use it, I'll pay the rent that I owe.   \n**Judge:** 4 months rent + legal fees = XXXX.XX  \n**tenant:** I'm not going to pay his lawyer! XXXX that!  \n**Judge:** Don't curse in my court room!  Also that legal fee is part of your punishment for wasting everyone's time. Do you feel that amount is too LOW?   \n**tenant:** *the obvious dawns on her* No, sir.   \n\nLegal stuff occurs. Later in the apartment while the owner is counting out the money that has been paid to him, I am reading and explaining how to use the oven cleaner. She didn't know that for that particular cleaner, you need to turn the stove or oven on until it hits a certain temperature for a few minutes and then turn it off, spray the chemical on and wait 5-10 minutes for it to work before wiping clean. I explain on what gloves she should wear and how to wipe it and rinse it down. She actually calls my Boss to praise me on how I taught her and that it works perfectly every-time she cleans her stove.

I use this time to determine if you meet the criteria that the Landlord has put prior to showing.  \n**Lady:** I see. I make a 100k a year and my husband makes 50k a year.   \n**me:** I can show the apartment any time between 8 AM to 8 PM.   \n**Lady:** I can be there at 4 PM. Is the address at the bottom of the advertisement correct?  \n**me:** Yes, the apartment is located at.....  \n**Lady:** I will be there.   \n**me:** Call me when you arrive and I can be out there within XX minutes.   \n**Lady:** Or you can be there for our appointment.   \n**me:** Too many people disappoint me and never show up.   \n**Lady:** Fine. *She hangs up*  \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\nI get a few more calls and one more couple decides they will be there at that time as well. The lady calls me at 4:40 PM, to tell me that she has arrived and is waiting for me. I get a call three minutes later from the couple as well. I might be disappointed in them if I didn't expect this by now.  \n\nI'm driving to the location and before 5 minutes go by since the Lady has talked to me, I get a phone call.  \n**Lady:** Are you coming?  \n**me:** Yes. I will be there in 5 minutes.  \n**Lady:** I have been waiting here for an hour for you already!    \n**me:** You called me a few minutes ago, not an hour ago.  \n*She hangs up*  \n  \nI arrive at the location and find both waiting in the courtyard of the complex.   \n**me:** Hello, I am XXX and you are here to see the apartment? I will take you up now.   \n**Lady:** We all have been waiting an hour for you!  \n**Couple:** We just got here 8 or 10 minutes ago.  \nThe Lady and the husband doesn't seem to acknowledge their presence. They rudely push their way through them to follow immediately behind me. It's a bit disconcerting to see that behavior especially since as potential customers they are making themselves look bad in front of me. The husband seems to the silent type that communicates through grunts and nods.   \n\nI get to the door and unlock it. Before I can open it the Lady asks a question.  \n**Lady:** Wait one moment. Will you be the one that decides who takes the apartment?  \n**me:** No. The landlord will decide.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\nThe Lady then pushes me out the way, opens the door and walks into the apartment. The husband grunts as he walks past me. The couple exclaims on their rudeness. I let the couple in and give them a quick layout of the apartment before letting them explore. The female of the couple is walking down the hallway, heading to the bedrooms when the Lady appears from the bedrooms, shoves her into the closet in the hallway and walks up to me. She didn't even apologize to her.  She is very rude and making an horrible impression on me.   \n\n**Lady:** I like the place. I want it. I have the money, tell you boss to get over here on the double.   \nHer Husband grunts in agreement.   \n\n**me:** That isn't how it works. You must fill out an application and bring back necessary proofs of id &amp; work history as well as pay an small nonrefundable application fee.   \n**Lady:** FEE! Fine. Give me the application, I'll pay later.   \n**me:** No. Payment first.   \nLady's Husband: Stop giving him a hard time. He just works here.   \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\nThe Lady hands over the fee and takes the application. I take from them their names and phone number and some other bits of information. She walks out with her husband. The couple asks a few questions and also take an application.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\nThe couple calls me later that night and asks to drop off everything in the morning. I agree and tell them the best time. That morning, the landlord express interest to meet the couple and take the application since he is in the area for an unrelated reason.  I tell him that the couple will be waiting in the courtyard. I call up the couple and tell them where to wait. The Lady then calls me and tells me that she will be there to drop up the paperwork. I tell the landlord and then go about my business.   \n\n**Landlord:** Hello. Are you XXX?   \n**the Couple:** Yes. We are. Your agent told us to bring the application and our proofs. He told us ....  \n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The two of them discuss some business and leave. The Lady's Husband arrives and hands the paperwork to the landlord and then asks him if he will decide on who gets the apartment as the landlord reads through the documents.   \n\n**Landlord:** Sir, can you wait one moment before you leave?  \n**Lady's Husband:** Yes?  \n**Landlord:** It says here that you are 23. You look more like you are in your late fifties.   \nThe Lady's Husband pulls out his employee badge that shows his birth date to be 23 years ago. He is in person very visibly in his late 50s. The badge's picture has a much younger face with a different first name than is listed in the application.   \n**Landlord:** Okay. So these are both your kids and they are in fact 11 and 12 years old?   \n**Lady's Husband:** Of course! Is that it?  \n**Landlord:** Where do you live now?  \n**Lady's Husband:** I am renting a space at the address provided. I'm just looking for a bigger space. I am raising kids after all.   \nThe Lady's Husband leaves and I get the applications later from the landlord. My boss relates the events with some humor.   \n\nI do a check on the information they provided and do a little investigation of my own from other sources. Many potential customers are surprised later to find that I don't just use the information they submitted in my decisions.   \n\nI get a call from the Lady.  \n**me:** Hello.  \n**Lady:** Did you review my application? Is it a Yes or a No?  \n**me:** I have some questions you need to answer first.   \n**Lady:** I don't have the time for that. Is it Yes or a No?  \n**me:** My decision is based upon the information you give me as well what I can derive.  If you can not answer my questions then it is a No.   \n**Lady:** Fine. What are they?  \n**me:** Where are you living now?  \n**Lady:** I am renting an apartment. The address in in the application.  \n**me:** Do you mean....  \n**Lady:** Yes, that's it.   \n**me:** So you don't own that property?    \n**Lady:** Why would I rent property that I own. *She laughs*  \n**me:** So these public records that I found that shows that you owned this property since 1995 and have remortgaged it three times since is wrong?  \n**Lady:** I didn't give those records!  \n**me:** I told you that I will check your id and past work history. It would be pretty lazy of me to only use what you give me.    \n**Lady:** This is a clear invasion of privacy!   \n**me:** Public record.   \nLady hangs up. I never hear from her again. My investigation from her has found that she rents multiple apartments across NYC and owns three buildings. Her son is 33 and is currently serving a prison sentence for something that I haven't determined and those kids are his. No wife. I don't understand what they are playing at and I don't want to be involved.  ",

I'm inquiring about the advertisement I saw on {insert ad source here}, is it still available?  \n**me:** Hello. It is is still available. I can show the property during this time period. Is it for you?  \n**Wife:** No it's for my husband, he teaches at a college in NYC and commutes to work from Maryland everyday. I convinced him to stop wasting gas on his beast and to live in the city for a week and then come home. He has been now wasting money in expensive hotels and I decided to help him look for a small property to live during the week. Does the property have.....  \n**me:** Yes. It does.   \n**Wife:** That's wonderful! I'll give him your name and number and tell him the time period you are available so he can come over and look at. Thank you.   \n**me:** Your welcome, Goodbye.     \n\nI get his call late last night. We work out an appointment time a few hours after the crack of dawn.    \nHe arrives and except for his sandals, he looks very much like a stereotypical Indian College Professor in America.   \n\n**College Professor:** Good morning. Can I see the property?  \n**me:** You can't double park your car there and it is blocking the driveway.   \n**College Professor:** Oh, it will be fine.   \n**me:** I'm renting this parking lot to a few clients. Your vehicle blocks their way. Please move it. There is also a police station a few blocks down on this very street and their morning shift just started.   \n**College Professor:** There is no other parking spots. I also don't mind the ticket.   \n**me:** If you don't move the vehicle then I will have no choice but to have it towed.   \n**College Professor:** I'm a potential client. That is certainly not the way to treat me.   \n**me:** I have clients that use the parking lot and I would not be respecting them if I let you get away with this. Please move the vehicle.   \n**College Professor:** He moves the vehicle out of the way and still double parks it on the street, a mere few meters from two perfectly good parking spots.   \n**College Professor:** Can I see it now?  \n**me:** The cops tend to be cranky this early in the morning and this close to their precinct. They will do something to your vehicle.   \n**College Professor:** My wife's a brain surgeon. I have enough money to pay some tickets. Can I see the property now.  \n**me:** Ok, please follow me.   \n\nI show him the property. He seems to like it.   \n\n**College Professor:** The property is much smaller than I was lead to believe.   \n**me:** No. This property is exactly this XXX sq feet.   \n**College Professor:** Then you obviously don't know anything about marketing.   \n**me:** I'm sorry?  \n**College Professor:** You see, you always over-exaggerate the dimension of the item and the condition of the property to attract potential customers. Then you use obfuscation tactics to hide the truth when they see it person.     \n**me:** That's both false advertising, immoral and doesn't that mean you expected this property to be smaller than what the advertisement said it was?  \n**College Professor:** He ignores the last bit of my response. “But not illegal.”  \n**Me:** No.  \n**College Professor:** Trust me. I do know what I'm talking about.  \n**Me:** No. You don't and stop trying to convince me. It is a waste of my time.   \n\n**College Professor:** Okay, then what is the particulars involved?  \n**me:** As the ad said, all utilities is included except you will have to pay a little extra if you install a AC or an electric heater. Cable is not included and you can't install a satellite dish. First month's rent + Security Deposit + Application Fee + this fresh install of a CO/smoke/fire detector fee + a Prorated Fee.   \n**College Professor:** I never heard of the term Prorated. What is it?  \n**me:** The fee depends on when you move in. It is determined by dividing the monthly rent by the number of days of this month and then multiplying it by the number of days left in the month when you sign the lease.   \n**College Professor:** We can negotiate all of this of course.   \n**me:** no. The owner does not negotiate.   \n**College Professor:** But he has to if he wants to run a successful business.   \n**me:** The owner does not negotiate. You can either accept the terms or leave.   \n**College Professor:** I'm only going to sleep here. I don't need the detector.   \n**me:** It's illegal to provide a studio or apartment without one in NYC and this one is electrically wired in.  \n**College Professor:** Surely, we can come to a different arrangement.  \n**me:** No.  \n**College Professor:** Your parents came from India?  \n**me:** Yes.  \n**College Professor:** I'm from India as well!  \n**me:** So?  \n**College Professor:** So surely we can...  \n**me:** There is no preferential treatment given. No negotiation on the price. If you like the property and wish to rent here, then you must fill out an application and provide certain proofs.   \n**College Professor:** And then I can give you the money to rent here for a few days?  \n**me:** No. Once you submit the paperwork, then I will check the proofs submitted, run a credit check on you and a few other checks on your past history. I will then submit it to the owner and the owner will decide whether he wants to rent to you or not. You must also sign a 1 year lease.   \n**College Professor:** There is too many constraints here. You can not possibly run this business like this.    \n**me:** Are you interested?  \n**College Professor:** We can come to a better arrangement.  \n**me:** Please stop trying to negotiate. You are wasting my time.  \n**College Professor:** I still have a trump card. You don't want me to use it.  \n**me:** Can you leave now? You are just wasting my time.  \n**College Professor:** I can complain to the city that you are running an illegal tenements.   \n**me:** What?  \n**College Professor:** This building is obviously a house redesigned illegally into an tenement.  \n**me:** This building was originally a hotel and then converted into an apartment building and all of the apartments and studios are legal rent stabilized apartments. The XXX will probably laugh at your complaint and then close it. Now, please stop wasting my time.    \n**College Professor:** “You'll see. You'll be sorry.” He leaves.   \n\nHis wife calls me later that night to apologize for her husband's behavior and asks me to fax the documents to her. I tell her that the owner does not do business like that. The owner would rather have the potential customer come in person and take the application and the list of proofs needed. She tells me that she will send her son to pick it up. I give the application and the paperwork.   \n\nThe College Professor shows up to give in the paperwork. We are standing outside the property.   \n**College Professor:** “This is all of it and this letter,” he winks at me as he hands me a sealed envelope, “is the letters from my employment.”    \n**Me:** I open the letter as he tries to stop me. I find a $300 with the employment letter. “I cannot accept money at this time. Take this back.”  \n**College Professor:** He takes the money back and then pulls out a money clip and ask me, “How much to put my application above the rest?”  \n**me:** Through the information that you have provided and your application.   \n**College Professor:** Think of it as a gift.  \n**me:** No. I deal with information. No one is given preferential treatment over the other.  \n**College Professor:** You look young.  \n**me:** …  \n**College Professor:** I do know of few young girls that...  \n**me:** No.   \n**College Professor:** or young men...  \n**me:** No.   \n**College Professor:** Are you a priest in your free time?  \n**me:** No. Goodbye.

        "text": "[@#$ = various profanity][Edits are made to make this more clear.]\n\nI work for a real estate company that manages an group of apartment buildings and we tend to get all sorts of applicants. Some people surprises us.   \n\nI had a studio for rent that I put up for advertisement that was best for one person and that's it. At 450 sq feet with a separate locked bathroom in the hall outside the studio, it tends to be grabbed up by single college students and older retired folk than anyone else.   \n\n*phone rings*  \n**me:** Hello.  \n**Gentleman:** Hello. My name is XYZ.  Is the studio still available for rent?  \n**me:** Yes it is. The studio is best for one person. (I have to say that since I have learned that people generally don't read ads completely)  \n\n**Gentleman:** I live with a child and dog is that fine?   \n**me:** 450 sq feet is really small. It's best for 1 person. If you like, you can come and see it but I don't think it's big enough for you.   \n**Gentleman:** That is perfectly fine. We don't need much space. What time can I come.  \n**me:** You can.... (I'm trying to omit irrelevant details that needs to be anonymized)  \n\nSo at the appointed time. An old minivan parks near the building. The Gentleman steps out wearing a suit you would expect a british butler would wear, he's African-American and very thin. I assumed that a child stepped out next but I quickly realized that she was a midget. She wore a purple tutu, had a multicolored mohawk and leather jacket with a pair of heavy army boots. The driver also stepped out and he was wearing an identical suit to the Gentleman and a dog collar and much younger than he.  The Gentleman lead the pack to me.   \n\n**me:**Hello. Are you here for the studio.   \n**Gentleman:** Yes. We are.   \n**me:** It's 450 square feet. It's too small for three people.   \nGentleman gestured to his two companions and said: It's perfect for me, my child-@#$ and cur.   \nThe Younger man slapped the back of his head so hard that the Gentleman staggered forward. The Gentleman turned to face him and got an uppercut to his groin by the midget. He crumbled to the floor.   \n\nThe younger man strode back to the van and the midget in a voice far louder than I thought could come from her said, \"I told you to @#$ quit with the profanity and to @#$ing find a proper apartment for us you little @#$!\"  \nThe Gentleman looked up at her not in fear or horror or surprise but of total love.   \n**The Midget:** I'm sorry the studio is far too small for our needs. Do you have anything else that is big enough to accommodate 3 people?  \n**me:** No Ma'am.   \nThe Midget smiled at me and said, \"Thank you and I'm sorry we wasted your time.\"     \nShe then spat in the Gentleman's face and strode off to the minivan.   \n\nThe  Gentleman got up, dusted himself off with a brush that he pulled out of his pocket. He combed his hair and made himself look more presentable again. He then started to apologize for the event that occurred and then asked me if I had anything else for rent. Then he face scrunched up with pain and with what I think was pleasure. The midget had came back and from behind him, grabbed his groin hard and started to pull him back to the minivan.  \n**The midget:** You @#$ing @#$! Would you get you ass back to the van already!  \nWhen they got back to the van I heard a series of profanities that ended with, \"You came! You could even wait till we got home?! You are @#$ing getting the cane when we get back @#$!\"  \n\nI didn't move from my spot the entire time. I am still not sure if that was real or if it was some sort of elaborate prank.  ",

        "text": "They've been having me float around the rock factory lately, helping whoever needed it. It gave me an opportunity to get away from Onions and see some of the other people around the factory. Although, I do want to tell one quick story about Onions that also sort of illustrates the chain of command in the factory.\n\nI'm at the peon level. Even though there's a running joke that I'm actually the High Speed lead, I'm just at the same level as Onions and the rest of everyone in that area. Redwood, in addition to running a machine, is the actual High Speed lead, so he ends up stopping the machine a lot to address everyone's issues. Above Redwood is Tom, who's the production supervisor. He's in charge of making sure everything in the actual factory is running smoothly. Above that is Singer, the plant director. He's more in charge of strategy than tactics; he orders new machines and hires new employees. He's also one of the Big Four. If the Rock Factory was a video game, the four biggest bosses would be Singer, Mechin (the facilities, maintenance and safety director), Chester (the supply chain director), and Baller (the CEO).\n\nNow, Singer interviewed and hired Onions, and Techin gave him his orientation tour, but Tom is the one who trained him and told him what to do from his first day of employment. Now, a month later, Redwood happened to mention that Tom was the supervisor in a story or whatever, and Onions is completely surprised. I remember one day Tom told Onions that he would be loading in the 6Barrel area instead of Pez. Onions straight up told him that's not what he got hired for. It makes a lot more sense that he'd do that, not knowing Tom was his boss's boss...\n\nThis story, though, is about some of the others around the factory, and what we put each other through. There are a lot of people who take jokes really well, so there are always pranks. Usually they involve someone getting chemicals on them. A classic one is when Redwood was working in the APP area, the lead told him to ask the then-supervisor about an order. The then-supervisor was a woman, and she's since been promoted to the Head of Sales. The APP Lead told Redwood there was an order that had to ship today that he couldn't find, and that he needed Redwood to go ask the supervisor about the \"cunnilingus\" order. At the time, Redwood was apparently pretty naive, because he did. Luckily, this is the rock factory, so everyone thought it was hilarious. Redwood was thoroughly embarrassed, and there wasn't any sexual harassment BS.\n\nI used to be the Warehouse Lead, but then I took leave for a couple months and ended up back at the bottom. Zany, the new warehouse lead, is an awesome guy, but he hates his job because he has to deal with cleaning up after everyone else. While I was bringing a pallet to shipping, he was following behind me in his forklift, trying to get around me to return to the stacks of his lair. He didn't honk or anything, and I'd only barely noticed him out of the corner of my eye, so he was just following behind me since I was walking lively. We got to a choke point right before our paths would split, and I slowed way down, eventually stopping with his way completely blocked. I stand there and start scratching my ass for a second, then turn around at him, grinning. He's just sitting there with his arms out and his head back like \"ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?\" Then he sees me looking at him and knows I'm just messing with him, and he just bends over, laughing and shaking his head at me.\n\nIt wasn't too long ago we had a guy with us in High Speed we'll call G. Now, G was a big black guy, but he was also the biggest pansy. He called me OG after I walked up to another machine operator (we'll call him Emo) and turned his music down. To be fair, Emo really tried to project this tough guy persona, but to me he really just came across like a teenage emo boy. The way he dressed, the music he listened to, the way he acted... yet he's older than everyone else in High Speed. Apparently G was a little intimidated. To be fair, we lost G one day when a burner malfunctioned and caught fire. When the flame rose up, G just screamed, \"OH, SH*T!\" and bolted. The burner just got hosed down with a fire extinguisher (PASS is an important acronym in our factory) and the maintenance lead replaced it. We never saw G at the rock factory again, however. He's the kind of guy who abandoned a car on the side of the highway because it broke down, though...\n\nBesides being called Princess Hitler and OG, lately they've been calling me the Honey Badger. About a month ago, a 20lb box of rocks dropped on my head. I ended up being absolutely fine. A couple weeks later, while we were installing new racks in the warehouse, a 200lb beam landed on my foot. Of course, it was literally the one day that I decided not to wear my steel toed boots. Everyone else pointed out how nonchalant I was about it (\"Hey, guys, can you get this off my foot?\") and between that, the rocks dropping on my head, and an incident where I started my shift by walking to High Speed, throwing up, then immediately starting doing my job, now Honey Badger is apparently a thing. Although, I'm rather partial to Princess Hitler.",

        "text": "Onions doesn't just lack common sense; he seems to go in complete defiance of it.\n\nI'm fairly lucky in that my interactions with him are limited. Mostly we only see each other when he brings me boxes and paperwork, although sometimes he fails to do that and I get to hunt whatever I'm missing down myself. Although, today, he'd been really good about remembering to bring me things. This story, however, is about when he came down just to try and help me get caught up.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why the QA position that I was subbing in for is the single hardest in the factory. There was a rotating schedule of which lines would be used by which teams each week, so that the QA guy on the line I'm on this week doesn't get burnt out catching the heaviest, most difficult rocks day after day, week after week. Today, it was probably about 90 degrees where I was standing, and the rocks from three different orders were coming out of the machine at once. It was apparent that I was fighting a losing battle and would have to press the kill switch when Onions came by. He grabbed the (correct) gloves and started helping me with the rocks for two of the orders.\n\nNow, there were three orders coming down. One was the 1\" tall rocks, and the other two were for the same type of rocks, but they were two separate orders. Once you look at the rocks, you can tell what chemicals have been applied and make sure they're right. Y'know, basic QA. After you check them, you box them up and throw them on a skid. \n\nAbout three hours later, I'm looking at the paperwork for one of the orders Onions inspected, and I realize the numbers are way off. So, I open the boxes and, lo and behold, Onions has put two completely different orders together. Not like mixed up Order A with Order B. Not even just mixed up the boxes. He put rocks from different orders next to each other in the same box. I was already having a stressful day from looking at the literal three tons of rocks that had come down the line since he had helped me, so I just grabbed the box, found the lead Redwood, pulled two that didn't match out, and gave him a look like \"wtf.\" He asked, \"Who did that?\" I turned and glared at Onions, grabbed the box, and went back to grab the rocks coming out of the machine. The QA guy on the line next to me saw the whole thing about about hit the floor laughing. Redwood told him, \"I'm really surprised, usually PH (me) is brutal with Onions.\"\n\nOnions ended up coming back and sorting the orders out. Him, my brother and I are also going shooting, ATV riding, and swimming at his place on Sunday.\n\nBonus story: Redwood got me good today. \n\nTwo of the methods we ship by are freight and courier. Naturally, a pallet travelling by freight is going to fare a lot better than the same boxes being handled individually, so we have special boxes for the courier orders. Now, Onions has no idea about this. Hell, he probably has no idea about what he's doing half the time as he does it. \n\nOnions comes down to my end and says, \"Hey, Redwood said something about this being a courier order?\" I would not only have to go through and open all of the boxes that I had just taped closed and transfer their contents to the other boxes, but I would first need to trek to the shipping department, grab the boxes, bring them back, FOLD THEM, and put their inserts in. Did I mention we were 50 boxes deep? I about had an aneurysm. \n\nOnions then said, \"He also told me to tell you he was just kidding.\" I walked to the side of the machine and looked down, and he was standing there doubled over laughing. I flipped him off. Both hands. I already have my revenge mostly planned, but that will have to be in Rock Factory 6 or whatever.",

        "text": "Please feel free to give me any constructive criticism on how I could've improved upon my approach. I was asking my co-worker to stop making masticating noises with her mouth, as well as to stop clanking her mouse around like some feverish, computer-illiterate old lady. Keep in mind that her work station is in front of me but facing me, but we have dual monitors so we can't see each other's faces. Also, the office is an open plan and the only person behind her (G, briefly mentioned) is multiple desk spaces away, while there's nobody to either her left or right side. Also, if not immediately obvious, I'm E and she's L, and this conversation was held over skype.\n\n\n&gt;[2:25:29 PM] Me: Hey L, could you please chew your gum with your mouse closed and also fix your mouse speed so you don't have to keep lifting it and clanging it on your desk? Sorry, but I can hear it through my music.\n\n&gt;[2:26:28 PM] L: I haven't chewed gum all day today. Please check where theses noises you're hearing is coming from because its certainly not from me.\n\n&gt;[2:26:54 PM] L: I have manners and never chew my gym with my mouth open but today I haven't at all.\n\n&gt;[2:26:55 PM] Me: Well, I keep hearing these wet smacking noises, and I'm pretty sure it's coming from you.\n\n&gt;[2:27:08 PM] L: I am telling you its not\n\n&gt;[2:27:10 PM] Me: I'm just asking that it please stop.\n\n&gt;[2:27:35 PM] L: Right, but i cant stop something im not doing. Are you listening to what I;m saying&gt;\n&gt;[2:27:56 PM] L: I've never smacked any gym in here, im a respectful professional\n\n&gt;[2:28:57 PM] Me: I'm not trying to argue about whether it's happening or not. I keep hearing these wet, sloshing, mouthy noises, and they're coming from you, so maybe you're not conscious of it, but I'm bringing it to your attention now.\n\n&gt;[2:29:08 PM] Me: Anyway, thanks!\n\n&gt;[2:29:22 PM] L: E, I. Am. Not. Chewing. Gum.\n\n&gt;[2:30:16 PM] Me: Well whether or not gum is involved is aside from the point. I would just appreciate if you would be more conscious of your mouth noises. Thanks!\n\n&gt;[2:31:29 PM] L: I am not doing absolutely nothing with my mouth. I do not have any medical issues that would make my mouth, \"wet, sloshing, mouthy noises\"...I am sorry you're hearing these things. Nothing I can do about it though.\n\n&gt;[2:32:40 PM] Me: No worries. I'll bring it to your attention when it happens again.\n\n&gt;[2:44:53 PM] L: Don't bring anything to my attention. When you hear the noises you're hearing, see who its coming from first and then let them know. So you don't falsely accuse someone of something like you just did.\n\n&gt;[2:45:31 PM] Me: Well, the noises were coming from directly in front of me, so I did \"see\" where the noises were coming from.\n\n&gt;[2:45:50 PM] Me: I'm sorry you're so upset, but it's really affecting my ability to focus on work.\n\n&gt;[2:45:54 PM] L: How did you see it? Did you get up and look at my mouth?\n\n&gt;[2:46:12 PM] L: Im not upset. I don't like people making up stories.\n\n&gt;[2:46:27 PM] L: like what you're doing right now\n\n&gt;[2:46:39 PM] Me: I agree. I don't like when people make up stories either, unless they're funny or entertaining stories.\n\n&gt;[2:46:46 PM] Me: Anyway\n\n&gt;[2:47:09 PM] L: Right, in this case you're neither. Its just 100% falsehood.\n\n&gt;[2:47:11 PM] Me: When I was making calls throughout the morning, it was happening a lot too.\n\n&gt;[2:47:59 PM] L: Looks like you're really not understanding at all what I'm writing when I say that I DID NOT eat gum at all today.\n\n&gt;[2:48:20 PM] L: I can not help you if you're just not comprehending something\n\n&gt;[2:48:29 PM] Me: Ok, well we can come to the consensus that you did not eat gum, but I was hearing the noises from you.\n\n&gt;[2:48:47 PM] Me: So whether or not gum was involved is debatable, but the noises you were making are not.\n\n&gt;[2:48:48 PM] L: please stop making these things up because you loose a lot of credibility this way\n\n&gt;[2:49:07 PM] L: Its not debateble because I DID NOT chew gum. o\n\n&gt;[2:49:10 PM] Me: L, do you honestly think I'm trying to pick on you? I'm not. I'm being completely honest here.\n\n&gt;[2:49:19 PM] Me: k\n\n&gt;[2:49:30 PM] L: I am 100% sure you are picking on me right now\n\n&gt;[2:49:51 PM] Me: I'm very sorry you feel that way, but it's not my intention to incite a negative emotional response from you.\n\n&gt;[2:49:55 PM] L: yes, i do chew gum, matter fact, I have a pack in front of me. But today, of all days, I did not chew them.\n\n&gt;[2:50:06 PM] Me: I wasw simply calling to your attention a behavior that is very distressing for me to hear.\n\n&gt;[2:50:29 PM] L: And you insist that I did all these things with my mouth when i been quite this entire day\n\n&gt;[2:50:41 PM] L: Right, BUT ITS NOT FROM ME\n\n&gt;[2:50:49 PM] Me: Ok, forget the gum. Pretend I didn't say gum. But the mouth noises were there, which is why I brought it to your attention.\n\n&gt;[2:50:54 PM] L: Why don;t you understand that?\n\n&gt;[2:51:16 PM] Me: Haha, if it were coming from G, or a ghost on your left side, I'd be asking either one of them instead.\n\n&gt;[2:53:11 PM] L: E, I get very fraustrated when people accuse me of something I know I didn't do becuase I am very apologetic when i do something wrong and I like to recognize when I am wrong. But whem someone makes up all these things you're saying and we both know its not true, I have a problem with it.\n\n&gt;[2:53:36 PM] L: I don't tolerate falsehood.\n\n&gt;[2:54:05 PM] Me: I understand that you're unaware that you make these noises, but is it outside of the realm of possibility that you think you don't make these noises because you have your headphones on and you can't hear yourself?\n\n&gt;[2:54:47 PM] Me: It's not just the mouth noises either. You clatter your mouse around quite often, and I would appreciate if that would stop, too. Thanks!\n\n&gt;[2:55:51 PM] L: E, I control my mouth. I am aware of any normal or abnormal behaviors my mouth does. No one has ever complained about my \"mouth\"...Now you're complaining about my mouse? Like, really E. Are you that bored today?\n\n&gt;[2:56:25 PM] L: I am tired of all your rudeness and lack of honesty, so i have to end this because I have to get back to what i'm here for. Work.\n\n&gt;[2:58:04 PM] Me: No, I'm not bored. It's actually something that's been on my mind for a while. I just thought I'd mention it to you today. When you brought my smelly blanket to my attention, I didn't get defensive or bring up the fact that I had quit smoking months prior. I said I'd move it and that was it. I thought you would do me the same courtesy today, especially since you've previously felt at ease to take those kinds of liberties with me.\n\n&gt;[2:58:28 PM] Me: But you're right. I'm here to work too. Thanks for the reminder.\n\n&gt;[2:59:04 PM] L: You just confirmed my thinking. This was a retaliation. Just as I though. Thanks for the confirmation. At least I was honest with you. Which is what you lacked today.\n\n&gt;[2:59:23 PM] L: *Just as I thought\n\n&gt;[2:59:30 PM] Me: I'm sorry that's how you wish to perceive things.\n\n&gt;[2:59:49 PM] L: Don't be sorry- you just confirmed it.\n\n&gt;[3:00:01 PM] Me: k\n\n&gt;[3:00:33 PM] Me: Well I do appreciate you not clanking your mouse around anymore. Thanks!\n\n&gt;[3:01:11 PM] L: E, Please. Stop.\n\n&gt;[3:01:22 PM] L: You have no rights to treat me this way.\n\n&gt;[3:01:29 PM] L: I am not going to take this from you.\n\n&gt;[3:02:02 PM] L: I am going to behave like I do everyda. You will not control what I do. I have you respect this and know your boundries.\n\n&gt;[3:03:23 PM] L: * I hope you respect this/ What I am saying\n\n&gt;[3:03:35 PM] Me: Well then I believe I share that same right when I request for you to stop behavier that interferes with my focus while at work. Again, I'm sorry you're feeling attacked and felt the need to defend yourself so aggressively, but I stand by my claim that I didn't fabricate the mouth noises/mouse clankings.\n\n&gt;[3:03:41 PM] Me: bahavior*\n\nEdit: formatting and clarity.",

        "text": "hi there redditors from TFTJ. I work in a tiny dual credit charter school, in enrollment. Fortunately I am quitting, only about 2 weeks left. I have a few mildly weird stories but right now I just need to rant! \n\nThe school's registration process is a bit intensive, requiring potential students to visit the school several times before actually being enrolled. Sometimes these people are so impossibly dense, and it's incredibly frustrating telling person after person to \"sign here. No, not there - THERE, where it says 'student signature.' NO. THAT IS PARENT SIGNATURE. I need you to sign HERE.\" ~internal voice~: 'fuck, kid, you either desperately need glasses or you're missing part of your brain.'\n\nThen there are the people that come in an hour or more after their appointment time. I'm sorry but we don't start appointments later than an hour before closing. You were supposed to be here an hour ago, so now we have to reschedule you. It's not my fault you got lost, it's your fault that you didn't leave early enough when you knew you were going to an unfamiliar place! Or that one mother who was irate because she apparently didn't notice we closed at a certain hour, only finishing up existing appointments. Then claimed the appointment confirmation call said [insert closing time]. Joke's on you lady, we don't do confirmation calls, and you weren't even on the calendar. Not sure what she expected to get out of that. What was funny is she pulled the classic \"I'm never coming here again\" card, actually half turning around expecting me to call her back with an apology or something. Nope, good riddance to you.\n\nThe school has its own issues, of course. One is the bullheaded insistence to use actual paper instead of a computer. Seriously, it would make life easier for all involved if this stuff was ON A COMPUTER. But no, we must have stacks of paper around because...why? No reason. Just stubbornness, I guess.\n\nAnother thing that is odd is the lack of breaks. I usually work about seven hours, with barely a chance to run to the bathroom for a quick pee. In my retail job, a normal shift is 4 or 5 hours and we are required to take a ten minute break after 3 hours! I'm sure this lack of breaks is against some kind of law but I don't really want to push it, as I'm leaving the position soon.\n\nMost of the staff at this school is quitting, with few people lasting more than a few months. No wonder why. It's a pretty tense and uncomfortable environment, and certainly no love lost between staff and the higher ups.\n\nWow that felt good. Thanks for listening, fellow work drones!",

        "text": "This subreddit seems kind of slow, so I'd hate to feel like I was posting too often, but I have a ton of stories about the [Rock Factory](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/38lej4/a_new_guy_approaches_the_workstation/). And there are getting to be more with each new work day. This story, however, is again about Onions. Onions has not been doing well, you see.\n\nAt the very end of our production process in the rock factory, the QA guy checks that the rocks are good before sending them to the customer. It's an exhausting job, and entails checking rocks, box‌ing rocks, stacking boxes on skids, and pulling skids to the shipping department. Most people in the factory are cross-trained to do this so they can jump on and help out as well. \n\nAs it ended up, I was the one who ended up training Onions to check rocks. The rocks come out of the machine several hundred degrees, so there are special thermal gloves that are used to make sure that you don't burn the hell out of yourself. Onions was familiar with how hot the rocks were at this stage of the process, having spent a few previous sessions with me at that end of the machines. At the start of this session, he wasted no time in first grabbing a box, then immediately trying to grab a hot rock with his bare hands.\n\nNow, I could have said something and stopped him, but I'm kind of an ass, and watching him juggle that rock into the box amused the hell out of me. He shook his hands, trying to dissipate the heat left in his fingers, before sheepishly saying, \"I guess I should have worn gloves.\" I told him there were some on a table in the vicinity, and then went back to looking at rocks.\n\nWhen he came back, I'm sure I laughed at him, but Onions is pretty dense, so he carried on with his plan without noting that omen. Again, I could have said something and stopped him, but it was hilarious to watch him try and pick up four hot rocks simultaneously, with his only protection being latex gloves. Needless to say, he got burnt again. I let him just deal with the boxes.\n\nAnd of course, that incident isn't the end. In the first week since he joined our team, our team ended up having to print the Dark Order. Now, in addition to being an asshole, I'm also pretty anal and demanding about how my rocks and chemicals are. In fact, High Speed has affectionately dubbed me \"Princess Hitler.\" My standards are NOTHING compared what needs to go into the Dark Order. The Dark Order calls for a set of several very precise chemical recipes for the rocks. Not only is the customer that places the Dark Order a regular; that customer also regularly returns things that are just not perfect enough. In fact, I think that the ratio of the number of times they've ordered and the times they've returned something is probably 1:1, if not worse. One month, the Dark Order was the ONLY order that any of our customers sent back.\n\nOnions had been learning how to mix chemicals, and was willing to try to make the chemicals for this job himself. The first step is to add various pastes in different ratios by weights. Essentially, you set a container on a scale, then pour in the pastes from thinnest to densest. The weights need to match at every decimal level of precision that our scale has. Also, the pastes aren't very viscous, so you have to make sure you aim for the bottom of the container when pouring or scooping them in so a whole bunch doesn't just get stuck to the side.\n\nAnyways, Onions comes up to the scale, puts on a container, then proceeds pours paste not only into the container (good for him) but also all down the side of the container and even some on the scale as a nice touch. Naturally, the response would be to wipe the scale and unusable part of the glass with solvent to remove the paste, then continue measuring from there. Onions just confidently grabbed the next paste and started measuring it in.\n\nI strode up to him and again stressed how this was the Dark Order, and he didn't want it to come back on him. I pointed out he had to be incredibly careful with his measurements, and that the part all over the side was going to stick to the side, not to mention the part on the scale wasn't even in the glass, yet the scale was measuring them anyway, so his chemicals were inaccurate. He looks at me and says, \"Oh, it's okay, I was way over weight on that paste anyway.\" I grab the container out of his hand, throw it in the trash, and tell him to start it over and walked off.\n\nNow, Onions and I go back a ways. That's why I got him the job. And I know that despite being an asshole to him, we're still friends. Or at least, I hope so. I know he used to have an anger management problem, and he actually broke one of his teacher's arms. So far nothing like that's manifested itself at work yet, but I'm kind of nervous with the way that I things I do to him. For example, when I told him that everyone at work called him Onions behind his back because of his bad BO. He raised his eye and said, \"Wait, is this a prank? Because I'm not THAT gullible.\" His fiance was there, and she just said, \"No, honey... it's true.\" There have been times the man has smelled of literal feces.",

        "text": "The factory that I work in makes a variety of related products, but the methods by which they are made drastically differ. The station I work in is called High Speed, and I don't want to post exactly what we do (we're big enough it would violate Rule #1), so forgive me if I'm being a bit vague when I describe our process. Essentially, in High Speed, there are teams of three men. The first man goes and grabs the rocks from the warehouse and gets them ready and in reach for the second guy, who puts them in a series of two machines. When the rock comes out of the second machine, the QA guy checks the rock, then boxes it up and hauls it to shipping. Or, if they're bad, he smashes them in a bin.\n\nNow, lately had been a time of great restructuring in the factory. New machines were being added all over the factory, and there was going to be a new line of machines at High Speed - as well as a new team of 3 to run them. Things were getting juggled around so people could get trained, so I became the QA guy, and that left us needing a new stager.\n\nNow, I said there were different products at different parts of the factory, and the other relevant area is known as Pez, because of the way the rocks get stacked together after they're put through the machine over there. It was a different, slower pace over there, and plenty of people who couldn't make it at High Speed were more than capable at Pez. So, when we got our new replacement stager, he had already spent some time over at Pez, and had heard plenty of horror stories from others over there about how brutal High Speed. \n\nI remember once, I was operating and we had a stager call in sick. We got a temporary replacement from Pez who had never worked at High Speed. The poor guy went from staging 20 pounds of rocks a minute to easily four times that. Not to mention the pallets the rocks came in were 10 feet tall, so he had to repeated climb a stepladder. After less than half an hour into an 8-hour shift, he looked like he was going to die from a heart attack. Apparently he asked the lead if I was mad at him or something because of how hard I was making him work, and got told that that's just how High Speed operated. We ended up switching him out for another guy who had some chops.\n\nBack to the new line woes, though. Our stager-in-training was known as Onions behind his back during his time in Pez. This is because his BO was so bad, your eyes would water up like someone was cutting onions when he stood by you. Not to mention that he had to be told time and time again how to perform basic procedures. He was pretty naive when it came to work, though. One time, the plant manager and the production supervisor were discussing something importannt on the factory floor, and he interrupted them to ask if he had enough job security to quit his other job. They essentially didn't give him an answer either way, and he didn't get the hint his job security would probably improve if he got back to work, so he asked them about four more times before he finally wandered off to whatever he was supposed to be doing. The managers chuckled about it.\n\nAt High Speed, he didn't do much better. He could keep the pace up just staging rocks, but he didn't have a good idea of what to do next to keep the line moving. A few incidents that stand out... He got told to make 150g of chemicals for a job, and asked if he could make 200g instead because \"math is hard.\" He brought paperwork to my side of the machines, then when I brought it back and told him to fill it out (after showing him how to do it for the second or third time), he brought it back, blank again. And lastly, in High Speed you \"push down boxes.\" It's a thing. And he did it wrong. We showed him where to push the boxes and he did it wrong. We went down and rearranged the boxes so they were in the right place, then the next time he pushed down boxes, he did it wrong again. I put an empty skid in the spot where he was pushing the boxes, in hopes of guiding him into the right spot. He put the skid up, then he pushed the boxes into the wrong place. \n\nIt's sort of fun in some ways, though. He's sort of naive about the workplace, having gone to college and not working until he graduated. This leads to some hilarious reactions. For example, when the machine operator on our line flipped off the Facilities Manager, Onions about peed himself out of fear. The operator and that manager were actually really good friends and the type of blue collar people who do that, but it was hilarious to hear Onions say, \"I can't believe you just FLIPPED OFF your BOSS!\" \n\nOne prank we want to pull on Onions has actually been successfully done by our operator before, when he was a measly stager. Our Warehouse Lead was this really extroverted half-black guy (we'll call him Zany), and he was friends with our current operator, Redwood. Redwood was staging for Beelzebub, a quiet guy. Redwood and Zany got the idea to stage a fight in front of Beelzebub where Redwood would end up calling Zany a \"stupid n****r.\" When they did it, Beelzebub's eyes shot open, his face immediately flushed red and he suddenly acted VERY interested in the rocks that he was putting into the machines.\n\nThere is no real end to this story yet. Onions is gradually improving, but he still has a long way to go. I'm sure that I'll have plenty of other stories about him. Like the time we went out to shoot pool, and he comments about how we weren't playing slop and needed to call combos while literally simultaneously lining up a combo that he didn't call. But, there's one detail about Onions that I haven't mentioned, and it's something about him that brings me great shame. \n\nOnions only works in my factory because I gave him a referral.",

To add to this, we are also the drive-through tellers, and have to bounce between customers in the lobby and outside. This Old Lady was in the drive-through. I have a quick glance in the tube before I greet the customers, so I can verify what we're doing.\n\nMe - Welcome, were we just cashing this today?   \nOL - *blank stare*   \nMe - *seeing another piece of paper* Oh, you're depositing?   \nOL - *blank stare*   \nMe - *realising it was a post-it* Oh, nevermind, I...   \nOL - I JUST WANT IT CASHED\n\nSo I go back to my computer, and see we have a cheque for $1,000. But her note is for 3 $100 bills and 2 $50 bills. \n\nMe - Ma'am, since I'm not familiar with you, and you're cashing for a large amount, would you send through your license for ID?   \nOL - *blank stare followed by sigh*   \nMe - Thank you so much. Also, I see you only specified for $400, did you not mind how you got the rest back?   \nOL - *glaring* WHAT?   \nMe - You only specified how you wanted $400 back, so...   \nOL - I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME A THOUSAND DOLLARS!   \nMe - *fed up at this point* I know that ma'am, how did you want to other $600 back, or do you not care?\n\nShe confirms she doesn't care about the remainder, sends her license through, and I get her taken care of.

You'll need to come in and speak to someone about it.   \nOL - WHAT?!   \nMe - You would need to speak with a banker.   \nOL - Well, what if I just wrote a cheque out for the full amount and deposited it at another bank?

You're driving a car, you should have your license, and me asking for it does not make me the scum of the earth. And we don't really care if you take your $1,500 to another bank.

Any names have been altered for their protection. \n\nSo I wear many different hats at my job, from doing normal data entry, to working the front desk, call center and even doing billing and collections. The only things I can't do is actually diagnose anyone or sit in on groups as I'm not a counselor or clinician. Every Day, and I do mean EVERY DAY, I have someone or multiple someone's that need to pay their bill and argue with me that they don't owe. On the rare occasion I encounter individuals who have half a brain cell and understand that we provide a service, and yes they have to pay for it. I love these people. I give Discounts to these people. They pay without argument, they smile, they're happy about it and understand that although they are not getting a good (like they would in a grocery store or book store) they are receiving a service for one problem or another. \n\nEnter Jose. \n\n\nI hate this guy. He's in a 2 year Chemical Dependency program. At the beginning of his treatment, we told him clearly that he owed 231.25$ a month, and it was due on the 1st of every month (but we had a leniency that it had to be in by the 15th of the month to avoid a 30$ late fee). He signed a contract to this degree, so he obviously understood it.\n\nEvery Month he comes in, and I'm usually at the front desk so I have to ask him for his payment and he argues with me. \n\n\"But, I haven't received anything yet. I'm not paying for something I've never gotten!\"\n\nI don't know how many times I've had to tell him that he IS receiving a service from us, and therefore he needs to pay for his group and individual sessions as well as the UA tests that are sent out when he has those sessions with our counselors. After arguing he always ends up paying, but he only pays about 50$ every time, because \"that's all I have. Just take that and be grateful that I'm giving you anything.\" This is a Monthly occurrence. And I've told him multiple times that he can pay the 50$, but he'll have a larger balance at the end of his program to pay off before he can be discharged, to which he brushes me off and walks off every time. \n\n\nFinally it happened a couple weeks ago. He came in to have his very last session with his counselor and be discharged from the program. I presented him with a bill of 2300$ because the doofus hadn't paid nearly anything towards his program for the whole two years he'd been with us. He'd also accrued late fees because he NEVER paid on time. His face went pale, before it went scarlet with what I can only assume was misguided rage.\n\n\"What!? I am not paying this! I never received anything!\" But I was ready for this. I was ready for this idiot to tell me I had to give him a discount, and give him all this for free. So I pulled out the 3 page long invoice of Every Group session he attended, and every Individual session he attended and was getting credit for. \n\n\"Oh.. really? Well then I guess we can let your Parole Officer and Attorney know that you never attended these groups or individual sessions. And if that's the case, then you would certainly be Non-Compliant in your program. Is that correct?\"\n\nBeing non-compliant can range from having an angry family member at you to jail time. For Jose, it's Jail time. \n\nJose was silent. He carefully thumbed through all the pages I handed him and I could see the wheels turning. He stuttered a few curse words, some other words in Spanish that I didn't understand, before reaching for his wallet. He pulled out one bill at a time until it totaled the full amount of 2300$. It was probably the most satisfying moment I've had at work. ",

        "text": "Ok, so I originally posted this in Tales from Retail, but was told Rudely by a Mod that it was not appropriate there....so since there is not subreddit called \"Tales from the Counseling Office\", I'm guessing this is the best place for it....\n\n\nOk, so this happened to me while I was at work a couple weeks ago. I work in an office that specializes in chemical dependency, alcohol, domestic violence, anger management and mental health counseling. A lot of what we do has to to do with group therapy and individual sessions with counselors for chemical dependency (aka drug use). It's a huge bulk of our clientele, and with that we regularly admit new clients and do a standard urinalysis test to gauge what drugs (if any) are in their systems.\n\n\nI've worked at this company for nearly 2 years. I've done well over 300 piss tests. I know what is Positive. I know what I'm looking for on the test. It's seriously not difficult. 2 lines is Negative. 1 line is Positive. Plain and Simple. The test we use only looks for 4 main drugs; Methamphetamine (Meth), Cocaine, Opiates and THC (aka, Marijuana, including Medicinal Marijuana).\nThat being said, I was at the front desk, checking in clients for group and their individual sessions when a new client (NC) had just come out of her evaluation. The counselor who had been speaking with her explained everything that was needed and asked me to do the piss test for her since her next appointment was waiting. It's not my favorite part of the day, and usually I make the counselors do their own piss tests with their clients, but as I had just gotten caught up I put a smile on and said Sure.\n\n\nI walk this new client out to the UA room just outside the office in the hallway. It's basically a large closet, but it has a sink to wash hands and a small counter to do the necessary paperwork, along with the sticks for the tests and the cups to pee in. I instruct the new client to take the key to the bathroom and a cup and come back when she's finished. She comes back and because they don't pay me enough to touch this stuff, I make the clients hold the sticks in the cup. I go through the same sch-peel every time with every client when I do a piss test.\n\n\nMe: Are you taking any medications at all? (I'm writing down the ones she says on the test paperwork)\n\n\nNC: Yeah (blah blah blah)....Oh and I have an Rx for Medicinal Marijuana.\n\n\nMe: Ok great. I'll just write that down here too. No problem. (My state just legalized Marijuana, so it's really not an issue. We still have to write it down and our tests still test for it regardless, but again, not an issue.)\n\n\nNC: Ok, but it's not going to make me test positive right?\n\n\nI pause briefly. Yes... yes it is... But again... not a big deal so I brush it off.\n\n\nMe: Probably. But because you have a Medicinal Marijuana card, it wont' matter, so don't worry.\n\n\nNC: Oh, ok. I just don't want to get in trouble because I'm not taking Drugs.\n\n\nInwardly I correct her because she obviously is taking drugs, even if they are prescribed to her. It's been a long day, and while I was in a good mood, the stupid is strong with this one, and it's starting to wear on me. When the test comes back positive for THC there's a slightly different procedure with the test. Instead of signing a line that says they agree that they are negative for all substances (just the 4 we were testing for), NC has to sign the line that says they agree that they are Positive for one or more of the substances listed (I checked THC because that's all that came up). Now there's a problem.\n\n\nNC: Wait a minute... I'm not signing this.\n\n\nMe: ? It's just standard procedure. You tested positive for THC, which you knew you would because of the Medicinal Marijuana. It's not a big deal, but I need you to sign saying that you agree that that is in your system.\n\n\nNC: Well I'm not signing this saying that I've taken drugs!\n\n\nMe: But... Marijuana is a Drug. Just like all the other medications listed here. Like I said though it's ok because you have that card...\n\n\nNC: Listen, you obviously don't know what your talking about. I'm Not on Drugs!\n\n\nDefiantly she takes the pen and crosses out the term \"listed Drugs\" on the description above the Positive line and manually writes in \"Medicinal Marijuana\" even though I had Already Written that on the \"Medications Taken\" Section of the same paper. At this point, I've lost all the fucks I had to give and let her. She's signing the stupid thing and that's all that really mattered. It was just an eye opening experience that in all the other 300 piss tests I've administered, \n\nI:\n1: don't know what I'm talking about as far as Drugs are concerned and 2: had no idea that THC was not a drug.......\nToday I Learned.......\n",

        "text": "Hi all, very new user to Reddit, longtime lurker, first-time poster, etc. Hopefully this is the best place to share this tale.\n\nI work as an assistant editor/graphic designer/writer/sometimes customer service rep at a small weekly newspaper company. Our newspaper published an article on a Vietnam veteran who had a banner installed in the city as part of the city's military heroes banner program. We publish a weekly features piece on every veteran with an installed banner, as it's a series. \n\nSometimes we receive photos from the installation ceremony from the city clerk's assistant. Sometimes the photos aren't as great a quality when we receive courtesy photos, but we make due with the content we receive. \n\nAfter this article published, an older lady called to complain about the photo we used; it was a photo with several people included and was placed width-wise, already taking up several inches of print space as it was. \n\nMe: thank you for calling (newspaper), this is fatbabyotters, how may I help you?\n\nOld Lady: I want to talk to your editor.\n\nMe: Yes ma'am, I am an assistant editor, how may I help you?\n\nOL: This photo you used, I don't like it.\n\nMe: Ma'am?\n\n\n*after several minutes figuring out which edition, which newspaper and which story she was referring to (we publish 6 each week), I was finally able to understand. By now I was annoyed with the amount of my time she was wasting.*\n\n\nOL: I can't see the faces.\n\nMe: Ma'am, it's a large photo that expands the width of six columns on the front page. The people in the photo are visible and you can even read their names from left to right in the caption.\n\nOL: I still can't see them. You should reprint this and make it bigger.\n\nMe: ma'am, there are no factual fallacies in the article and it will not be reprinted. The photo already takes up several inches to make it clearly visible.\n\nOL: I just don't understand why you people can't do your job and reprint this photo so it's bigger. You take horrible photos.\n\nMe: Ma'am, I'm sorry to hear you don't like the photo, but it was a photo we received, not one that a photographer from our newspaper took. It is already quite large and cropped so you can view the subjects' faces. If it were to have been made any larger, the quality would have been blurry.\n\nOL: I will call the mayor, he will make you print better photos. He can do that, you know. I am calling the mayor's office right now.\n\nMe: *(thinking) you do that, I'm sure he'll drop everything to listen to your complaint about a photo you can't see probably due to your own poor eyesight.* yes ma'am, I speak to the mayor every week, I will wait for a call from him on this matter. Is there anything else I can do for you? \n\nOL: No! *hangs up*\n\n\nI promptly told the ridiculous complaint to every colleague within earshot. We all had a good laugh. The mayor also laughed when I asked him if he'd recevied her call, which he had, and jokingly ordered me to print better photos.",

        "text": "For those who requested the story of me telling a guy a year in advance that I was going to screw him over, how I was going to do it, why I was going to do it, and what he had to do to stop me.... And how I came out looking like a Big Damned Hero when I did in fact screw him over a year later.....\n\nI work in a testing lab of sorts.  Customers come to us with gizmos and we put said gizmos through their paces.\n\nWe have a regular customer, CustomerA.  They bring [Turbo Encabulators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLDgQg6bq7o) that they purchased from VenderB to us for testing.  Obviously, a Turbo Encabulator is going to need a turbine to run it.  The turbines are provided by VendorC.  As Turbo Encabulators cost several million dollars and the testing destroys them, these tests are obviously a very Big Deal.  VIPs from around the country come to witness the tests.\n\nAnywho, as I said, VendorC is on the hook to provide the turbines and maintain them (Note: While the Encabulators are destroyed by the tests, the turbines themselves are reusable.).  Unfortunately, VendorC wasn't really holding up their end of the bargin.  Yes, we had a number of turbines, but they were in very poor repair.  We were down to one working turbine with the remainders being \"hanger queens\" that we robbed parts from to keep the one running turbine up.\n\nAll of that is background information.\n\nEnter CustomerD.  CustomerD was a big spender with a different Turbo Encabulator.  CustomerD wanted us to test their Encabulator too.  Thing is, CustomerD did not have a turbine.  Further, CustomerD simply cut us a big check and said, \"Hey, you guys know turbines a lot better than we do.  Why don't you just buy the turbine for us?\"  I told them that we could in fact do that, but that legally the turbine would be our's at the end of the day.  CustomerD stated that they had no use for a turbine and as such did not care if we retained the turbine at the end of the test.\n\nThat's when I saw an opportunity to fuck over VendorC for not properly maintaining the turbines that they were supposed to maintain.\n\nI bought a turbine for CustomerD.  However, I purchased a turbine that was very well suited to be used on CustomerA's Encabulator.\n\nThis was happening right as we were testing an Encabulator for CustomerA so I pulled VendorC's representative aside and said something along these lines....\n\n\"I'm sick and tired of these crap turbines.  I'm refusing to use them again on safety grounds until you have completely overhauled them.  I'm shipping them back to your factory.  You had better overhaul them.  Because if you don't, I'll simply keep shipping them back to you over and over until you **DO** overhaul them.  If you don't, then the next time when CustomerA wants an Encabulator test **YOU** can explain to them why there are no working turbines available.  Something you have been paid a lot of money to do, I might add.  So if you don't want to look stupid, I suggest you overhaul the turbines that I'm going to ship you.  And when I say 'overhaul' I mean it.  I want every single O-ring/gasket/etc. replaced.  Anything less in unacceptable.\"\n\nA few weeks later, I shipped him every turbine we had.\n\nSix months later, the next Encabulator test was on the schedule.  I pointed out in some preliminary meetings that we still didn't have working turbines because VendorC had them in maintenance.  VendorC's representative was like, \"Yeah, we need money for that\" to which CustomerA said, \"You were paid money for that.  If you have spent it elsewhere that is your problem, not our's.\"\n\nAbout two months later the turbines showed up on my doorstep.  I took one look at them and could tell that the maintenance performed upon them had been minimal at best (details unimportant).  \n\nI waited a month and then shipped the turbines back to VendorC with a note.  \"I said they were to be **OVERHAULED**, not just hit with a pressure washer.\"\n\nA few months went by and the Encabulator test was just around the corner.  I pointed out in one of the meetings that we *STILL* didn't have functional turbines from VendorC; that they had been in VendorC's maintenance department for the better part of a year.  At this point, things got ugly and the VendorC rep was visibly sweating/squirming.  People were *pissed*.  A multi-million dollar operation was going to have to be delayed indefinitely because VendorC had not done what they were paid to do.\n\nAt that point I was like, \"Uh... I may have a solution.\"\n\nAll eyes turned to me.\n\n\"Recently we did a test for CustomerD.  We had to buy a turbine for their Encabulator.  That turbine is practically brand new.  It's only been used once.  It's sitting in our warehouse right now.  I'm pretty sure that it would actually work for your Encabulator.\"\n\nOf course, I knew goddamned good and well that it would work for their Encabulator as I'd fed my turbine vendor with CustomerA's turbine specifications when I purchased CustomerD's turbine, but nobody else at the table knew that.  I was simply a guy who saw a possibility.\n\n\"Do you have specifications for that turbine?\"\n\n\"Uh... In my office.\"\n\n\"Let's take a break.  Inigo93, could you dig those specs up?\"\n\nBlah blah blah....\n\nA month later CustomerA's Encabulator test went off without a hitch...Using CustomerD's turbine.\n\nVendorC came out looking like shit and the annual money they were paid to maintain turbines was cut off.\n\nI came out looking like the Hero of the Day and we get maintenance money for our tubine.\n",

In his 60s, a tall, thin man wearing a dirty t-shirt and shorts. We sat in a conference room and he told me about how he had been a succesful doctor in Arizona. So successful, he said, that the other doctors and hospitals had chased him out of town because he was too good at curing the sick. *Without sick people, they'll go out of business*, he told me. He was hoping to set up shop in my town, to cure everything that ailed everyone. We talked shop, I explained rates and contracts, etc ... and I thought maybe down the road he'd be a client.\n\nDidn't hear from Earl for a while. And then he arrived, once again. He placed a personal ad seeking a woman he'd had a chance encounter with, a woman with *the forehead of a dolphin.* He came in every week thereafter, increasingly agitated, seeking the dolphin headed woman. Each week, I dutifully kept his money, placed his ad, and knew I'd see him next week. (Because really, what woman is going to read the personal ads, see \"Seeking Dolphin Headed Woman\" and think, THAT'S ME, I HAVE TO ANSWER THIS AD!)\n\nThen one week, he came in with a bigger idea. Why pay small amounts of cash for a tiny ad, when he could pay hundreds of dollars for a big print ad in the front of the paper? I set him up in the conference room, as he designed his ad, checking in every few minutes to see if he wanted help, ideas, spell-checking, etc. No, every time. And then he presented his masterpiece. Two \"mug-shot\" type drawings of the dolphin headed woman. One, a profile, the other, a face shot. And a description of their meeting, where she touched his life.\n\nI took his money. His ad ran on the cover page. I enjoyed the commission.\n\nA month passed with nothing from Earl. And then he arrived. *I had an experience with Meth last night. It was like sex ... with carpet* (at this time, he pointed at the floor). He went on to tell me about how it was time for him to leave town, but he wanted to trust me with a set of documents to deliver to the Dolphin Woman.\n\nWhat was in those documents was madness. A screed that started with a version of the Moses story that involved Egpytian Lesbians teaching him to swim with the crocodiles and feces, through proof that God's punishment to man was to eat feces and how to become true beings we needed to eat gold, to a dozen pages about how the dolphin woman was the reincarnation of God, here to teach Earl to eat gold.\n\nLovely. A love story.",

A few years ago I worked a part time second job for the county’s medical examiner’s office for a little extra cash. It was my job to pick up dead bodies either from hospitals or from where they died and transport them to the ME’s office. I have many, MANY stories but I figured I would share my most memorable. On hospital calls we would transport solo. On home pickups we always had a partner. This instance is of the later variety.  He doesn’t add anything to this story, but he does in others I may tell. \n\nIts my first night on the job. We get a call from dispatch to collect a body we head to the address and talk with the cops on scene. (Side note: every death scene will have police officers and a death investigator from the ME’s office.) Their only words are “HA. He’s all yours guys”. Awesome….\n\nSo we head on up to the second floor apt of a duplex. Door opens directly into a kitchen. We wait in the kitchen for the death investigator to do his thing. In the meantime we take in the sites of the room. Harley-Davidson. Everything is emblazoned with Harley. Pictures on the fridge are of his Harley, him on a Harley, some girls on a Harley, etc. Alrighty. Whatever. People have their own interests. So the doorway from the kitchen to the living room has sleeping bag stapled above it to act as some kind of curtain. Again, whatever. Not my place, people can live how they want I suppose. So we make into the living room which is where the man collapsed on the floor and died. I have no idea what from, its not my job to know. Me and my partner are taking in the scene while the DI does his thing. Now this room is where things get weird. On one of the end tables is a pile of pot, some rolled joints and some cocaine. Cops are busy bagging everything up while we wait. Next let me describe this gentleman. He is naked from the waist down (which is oddly common among the dead) and wearing a Harley t-shirt. Ohh and how I wish that’s all. On top of that he is wearing a pink negligee, pink thigh high stockings, and makeup. We move him to start the transport and we find the matching pink high heels underneath. If that wasn’t enough of a show, the room has about 20 didoes scattered across it. About 10 in a tool bag next to the TV and one suction cupped to the coffee table with dried shit still on it. What a great day my first was turning into. That was only my third pickup of six that night.\n\nI will never be able to, for as long as I live, remove the image of that pickup from my head.\n",

        "text": "“We need a goal,” he said with a disgruntled look on his face. This was him, my official, addressing myself and my other two co-staffers in the office today. My Chief of Staff, ever the man of action and arguably the most important man in this entire puzzle, was out of the office. I think it was a meeting, but he was most likely trying to decompress from all the stress he’s been under lately. As I said before- he tries to move the world by himself, and doesn't let anyone try to help him. I personally think it’s because he doesn't want anyone to bear his burdens, but I also think it could equally be his work ethic makes him too proud of the burden itself to lighten it at all. Whatever the case may be, the only person in the office worth their weight in gold was out, and here we were, staring the man without goals in the face as he told us “we need a goal.” \n\nIn many dictionaries, a goal is defined as a sort of milestone someone would want to achieve. To have a goal itself is to imply ambition, drive, or some sort of work ethic. Antonym: laziness. \n\nThe usage of the word “goals” is also a funny thing for a person who absconds from having them in the first place. For some people with my boss’ job, they’d set goals. A great many might even set the goal to be submitting bills, or maybe getting a reform passed. Possibly you might suggest that they set the goal to be to help over 1,000 constituents in a single term or less. It would also be honorable to think that a good goal would be to try and work behind the scenes of politics itself to move the wheels just *that* much faster. \n\nMy boss’ goal?\n\nNot too sure. He wants to be an ambassador to some country. He also wants to do stuff for education. Jokes on him though- he’s already past the prime, and then some, of his life. He has literally no political power, because he never had any ambition to get any, and all he has is seniority in the state legislature, which is of itself hilarious because everyone in the know itself knows that he’s someone who votes whatever way he thinks looks politically the best. This is used to great effect by his party superiors, so I’d wager. The education thing is a joke too. If he was genuinely interested, he’d actually try. He’d get into the more closed political circles- he’d rub shoulders with the movers and shakers. Hell, he’d *become* one of those sort of people. \n\nBut we’re here to talk about goals. \n\nGoals. Funny things. Good things to have, if you do. If you don’t, sometimes you float by. Sometimes you can ride the waves of others, like a surfer over a vortex of deep blue. If you are particularly good at clutching coattails, you may appear to have satisfied faux-goals; ones that you set, or are at least saying you set while sitting in a press conference while in reality you made up those goals just now to make it seem like you achieved something.\n\nSigning onto a bill, for example, is a good way to say you achieved one of your “goals” when it comes time to grab some glory. That way, when it’s passed, and you no longer have to worry about it (as if you did in the first place), you can roll up to any constituent and say that not only did you vote in favor of it, but you *helped* to pass it. Although in reality, no work was done by you, no work really was ever thought of by you at all, and instead you may simply staple yourself onto the backs of others. You now look like you did something.\n\nNow, you've achieved your goal. Now, your constituents realize something- you’re a leader.\nYou can move mountains.\nYou can make things happen.\nYou can produce.\nYou can meet your goals. \nYou are a mover and a shaker.\n\nAnd now, you have their vote. \n\nGoals… If your only goal is to get re-elected, you can pretend you have a lot of goals. Boy, you can pretend to have the most important goals in the land. Then, when none of them come through, and because you already had so little (see: nothing) invested in the first place, it’s so easy to drop them that you can avoid any scandal. But any successes…. \n\nWell, it’s like fishing. \n\nYou have to find a worm first. Remember to dig where it’s moist- where it’s been raining. Somewhere the clouds have given a lot of attention. Find a big one. Find something that will attract a lot of fish. Make sure your hook is sharp- you want to be able to pierce that fish’s mouth. But not too sharp, otherwise you might cut right through it and the worm could fall off. Stick your hook into the worm. Live ones are best, as they dance with it. Fish get attracted. Bites happen; small at first, then a few, big crunches. I feel bad for the worm at this point, but that’s it’s job. Pull when you feel a tug. That hook has a job to do too, and so does the fish- but it’s just not conscious of it yet. Pull hard, now. Reel fast, then slow, then fast again to make sure you don’t stress the fish out. Work with the motions. Let it jiggle on the line- make a few waves here and there. Once you pull it out, you become god. It’s gills; now cemented together outside of the watery, self-suspending environment, are useless here. It can’t breathe, but you got the prize. Unhook it, and throw it in the cooler. Get it stuffed, and mount it. It’ll be a nice trophy over the fireplace, next to all the other ones. ",

        "text": "I have not posted in almost a year. Mostly because I didnt have a job (I have one now, but I havent had any crazy customer stories from there yet.) But you don't care, you're here because you were intruiged by my title. Let me tell you a story....\n\n--\n\nThe Bible Fair is a bi-yearly event held by the curches in our immediate town, plus the three towns surrounding us. About 16 churches in all participate, every one of them Christain. They pitch in building and renting kiddie rides, making attractions, and all that such. The whole fair is bible-themed. The boat swing called 'Noahs Ark' is decortated with animals. A 6-person cardboard church with preeteens giving 3 minute sermons. An 'adult' attraction preaches the ten commandments (focusing on adultery mainly). Etc, etc. For the past 4 years the fair has been held, it has had a 'Non-Christian' section, with no rides and mainly just booths that preach about Christianity. If you swear yourself to God and the Bible and promise to attend at least four church services, you can enter the main fair. Its really bigoted.\n\nI was hired by a friend of my mothers to work security seeing as how I know some self defense and can wrestle a bit. If I tried I could probably take down a grown man IF he wasnt fighting very hard. My station was the entryway between the Non-Christian section and the entrance TO the Christain section. Most of the day went fine, until a mother with her 3 children started screaming around halfway through the Fairs 3rd day. She will be called 'CrayLady'.\n\n&gt; CrayLady: \"I WILL NOT 'SWEAR' TO YOUR GOD! YOU MUST LET ME IN, THIS ISNT FAIR!\" (Juding by her skin color, I would assume she was Muslim, but since she wasnt wearing a Hijab I couldnt be sure. She could have been anything, honestly, but it wouldnt make the story any different.)\n\n&gt; Christian: Ma'am, you wont be let into the fair if you dont. \n\n&gt; CrayLady: MY CHILDREN WANT TO SEE THE FAIR! YOU MUST LET ME IN!\n\n&gt; Christian: This fair is Christian-themed ma'am.\n\n&gt; CrayLady: LET ME IN! \n\nAt this point she takes a swing at one of the workers. Since the two other teens on security started moving towards her, I followed. \n\n&gt; SecurityKid: Ma'am, if you don't calm down we will ask you to leave. If you don't leave we will use force.\n\n&gt; CrayLady: *screams and stomps off without her children* *Her children run after her*\n\nWe had thought the ordeal was over for good.\n\n&gt; CrayLady: *Stomps back with pocket knife and begins slicing up anything she can get her blade onto, including wood, metal, and almost a little kid. Almost.*\n\nMe and the other security teens surrounded her. One took her knife away and we apprehended her and called the police. She was found to be drunk. \n\nThe End.\n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/316kdy/vendetta_against_v/",
        "text": "As I’ve outlined in my [previous post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/311shf/the_meeting_of_the_fire_chiefs/) about *Contract Publishing Company*, where I work, the sales staff have few scruples. The worst one is undoubtedly a man (in the loosest sense of the term) who we’ll call V. Words I would use to describe his personality include ‘abrasive’, ‘greedy’, ‘idiotic’ and ‘careless’.\n\nFor example, when sales reps sell an advert into one of our publications, they’ll also typically include a half page or full page of commercial advertorial (an article that looks like a regular article but is actually paid content) for free, as a sweetener. Unfortunately, when V makes a note of this generosity on our internal systems he often forgets to tell the client, which can make for some embarrassing or awkward moments when they haven’t got a clue what I’m talking about.\n\nI’ve quietly nicknamed him the Penguin, because he looks exactly like Danny DeVito’s character in Batman Returns - balding head and scraggly hair, harsh, grating voice and a huge beer belly that wobbles when he walks. His favourite thing to do in the office is nap, and at lunchtime he’ll recline on his chair and start snoring. His shirt buttons don’t always remain closed. He’s also got tonnes of money and a big Mercedes jeep yet he apparently doesn’t have access to a shower or soap. What makes it worse is that he thinks he’s some sort of player, and gets very handsy with female co-workers. One girl in particular, who is about 23 and more than half his age, is the recipient of a number of gifts that she finds very creepy, and immediately gives them away. He’s also married, with children, however that happened.\n\nThese are some of his highlights:\n\nIn the past V has promised field interviews for half page commercial profiles (consisting of only 250 words), has sold cover stories [yes, some of our larger magazines have cover stories that are sold to a particular client, meaning there tends to be some repetition involving companies with deeper pockets] that have already been sold by other sales reps, and then he fights until he gets his way. V usually gets his way because his regular clients are among some of my country’s biggest businesses. If he goes, he takes tens of thousands of euro in sales revenue with him, probably more.\n\nVoice impersonations are a large part of V’s repertoire. One of the most famed stories about him around the office is that of a client who was becoming more and more impatient with V and his manner, and hung up on him. V immediately called back, put on an accent, and attempted to sell the ad again. The client knew who it was straight away, and hung up once more. \n\nThe worst story I heard about V only happened a few weeks back. Several staff members attended the funeral of the mother of one of our senior sales staff; our boss, heads of design and editorial, and V. V travelled to the funeral in his big 4x4 with several young members of our Events division, who obviously couldn’t get a lift with anyone else. When they arrived, V pulled in behind another car that happened to belong to our design director, J, who was retrieving an umbrella from the boot (trunk for you American folk) as V arrived. V began inching towards her, smiling away, pretending to trap her. But where normal people would stop, V kept going and eventually pinned J to the boot of her own car. J was pounding on the bonnet (hood) of his 4x4, screaming at him to back up, the Events team in the back of V’s Mercedes were screaming at him to back up and all the while V was nodding and smiling, having a great time. Eventually he backed up and got out, and couldn’t  understand why everyone was so mad at him. For a relatively accurate graphical representation of the inner working's of V's thought processes, please see [here] (https://img1.etsystatic.com/014/1/8195938/il_fullxfull.465378139_8tih.jpg).\n\nV didn’t even apologise until he realised J was ignoring his cheery greetings in the office, and was continually blanking his design requests. When she pointed out exactly why she was annoyed (understatement of the year) with him, he tried to deny any wrongdoing. But J was having none of it and eventually made him apologise in front of the entire sales floor, and he disappeared back to his pen with a very red face. In my opinion, J should have made use of a thick wooden stick in getting the point across. To each their own.\n\nJ’s back is also quite sore since it happened, and apparently she’s going to find out what’s wrong and maybe pursue him for it. One can only hope.\n\n**TL;DR - The only cure for stupidity is a belt of a good stick**",

        "text": "A little set-up is required for this tale. I work as a staff editor for one of the largest contract publishing companies in my home country. We mainly produce magazines or yearbooks specifically requested by clients, which will be distributed to members or customers rather than sold on shelves.\n\nAt the helm of *Contract Publishing Company* is our boss, Glorious Leader, a former salesperson who appears to have zero understanding of editorial, design or tact. What he does understand are sales, and the fact that the more ads they sell, the more money finds its way into his pocket, and so the Sales department is deemed to be the most important. Not Editorial (who actually write each publication and guide it to print), not Design (who create masterpieces from shit specifications), but Sales. The former are considered useful on certain occasions, but not indispensable.\n\nAs a result they’re given almost free rein and routinely ignore client requests about certain ads not appearing in their publication, or go on selling frenzies and transform titles with great potential into magazines chock full of often unrelated ads. Deadlines have essentially become nonexistent and in my time here I’ve had approximately two publications go to print on time. The rest are always held up because Glorious Leader sanctions the selling of more ads, despite having promised the client personally that we will deliver by a certain time. Cue unpleasantness between each editor and the client, as they wonder why their publication hasn’t gone to print yet. \n\nUnfortunately, even the more human sales reps are prone to this sort of irritating behaviour. One of these is someone I work with on a semi-regular basis: D. \n\nD is a lower-level salesperson who sells ads for our smaller titles, including one of mine that focuses on our city’s fire service. The client is a high-level officer in the fire service and while it’s not an official publication, we still have invaluable access to fire service personnel and stations across the city. One day I get a call from this client. We’ll refer to him as G.\n\n&gt;G: Hey, I have a new story for you, here’s the details. Oh, and we have a fairly serious issue involving your company that I need to talk to you about.\n\n&gt;Me, obviously a little taken aback: Oh? Ok, what is it?\n\n&gt;G: Well, we attended a fire at a university apartment complex a few weeks back, and we recently got a call from them. Apparently D from your organisation called them and pretended to work for the fire service. He told them all about the magazine you do and asked if they would like to support it with an ad, considering the great work the fire service did in saving their building. Then he told them they needed to make a quick decision as he was meeting the ‘fire chiefs’ later to discuss this. They have a recording of this conversation.\n\n**[Aside: the fire service in my city has one fire chief, not several. Despite the fact that D has worked on this publication for a number of years, he still doesn’t know enough about the fire service to create a more believable lie].**\n\nI don’t say anything for about ten seconds. I’m gobsmacked, really. Sales staff have pulled some pretty fast moves in the past, but I’ve only heard about those in stories. Now it’s happening to me.\n\n&gt;Me: Uh...let me pass this onto my editorial manager (ED) and out head of sales (HS) and we’ll get this sorted.\n\n&gt;G: Ok, thanks. Just so you know, I haven’t passed this higher up the chain. If the fire chief found out he’d immediately stop access to the stations and personnel, and the magazine would be finished.\n\nI duly passed it on. Glorious Leader, ED and HS all sat in on a conference call with G several days later, and the recording was played. ED pulled me aside after and told me how embarrassing it was. Even Glorious Leader cringed, and if he has a moral compass then I’m a banana. In the end it was all resolved, D was given a strong warning and the client was satisfied. Whether it’ll sink in for D, however, is another story.\n\n**TL;DR - If you don't want to start a fire, keep the monkey in his cage** ",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/30ucg7/ii_the_emails/",
        "text": "\n\nWhen I started working here, and by that I mean being paid actual money to show up instead of showing up randomly as an intern for a day or two, I started by doing emails. It wasn’t like I’d write emails to important people or change lives through my writing. What I would do, and still do, is read them. Every day. I’d log into Outlook under my official’s credentials, go through his inbox, and read the hundreds of unopened emails we get every day. All of the complaints sent in by constituents- all the requests for new legislation, asking for his support for this bill or that resolution, would be ignored by everyone. Everyone but me. It was my job to read them, file them away, and try to reply back in the voice and opinion of my state representative. \n\nThere are a lot of these. They’re sent in by computers, really, so technically they don’t count as constituent emails per se, but the websites that send them are political organizations which people sign into and give permission to use their name when sending letters asking for support or opposition of laws in the state. So although they’re almost always the same, generic, walls of text that no one cares about, they’re always recognizable as inhuman. And we get these. Every day. 90% of the emails in the inbox every day are these. \n\nSure, we get emails from constituents that are written out carefully, with time taken to make them personal and seemingly intimate. “I voted for you last cycle, and I did this year as well” some read. It’s nice to show support. Others simply say “I vote and I will remember your decision on this!”, warning the elected official, supposing he read them, of course, of the impending retribution he will face should he not abandon all previous positions in favor of this one single issue. \n\nHere's the fun part- I have to reply to these emails. The grand irony of this all is that every single email, from the Governor right down to the constituent farmer who lives in Bumshart, Nebrahoma (Credit: The Oatmeal), is addressed to my elected official. He will never see them. He hasn't opened his email in around three or more years. I think the one time he did was the day after it was given to him by the state after he won his first election. Since then he waves it off like it's a bag of toxic waste. \n\nNow when I reply to these emails, I have to not only form an opinion on behalf of my boss, but I now also have to *sound* like him. The trouble is how do you reply to an email in the voice of a condescending asshole without coming off as an asshole in the first place? \n\nThere is a light at the end of this torturous tunnel. Thankfully, all of these constituent emails and issues are filed immediately into a tidy little folder never to be seen again, titled \"Handled\". Job done. \n\nSo at the end of every day, I look at my pristine work inbox, now cleared, and realize, that many people today have contacted an elected official of the State gov't with hopes of getting their point across to the man they were told would listen to them and weigh their opinions when voting in the legislature. I regret the lie that I have to tell many people- in his name- that *I thank them* for contacting *my* office, and for giving me their opinion. \"I'll\" be sure to think of it when I'm voting next. \n\nNoticing my few hours are up in the day, I close Outlook, log off the state computer, turn it off, and head home. This process repeats every day. My chief of staff looks at the inbox the next day, pats me on the back and says \"good job in keeping it clean.\"\n\n[Link to Part I: Years in the Making](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtheoffice/comments/3062qq/years_in_the_making/)",

        "text": "I've been working for this government now for a few years. Started as an intern, and before that a campaigner on the trail of a candidate or two. That was back in highschool. I was still somewhat hopeful, and in turn interested in politics. However interesting my life was back then, I consider the more recent years to be some of the more... humorous ones, to say the least. \n\nThe life of a civil servant isn't easy. It's filled with trials and tribulations; a constituent is stuck in a life-threatening bureaucratic paper loop, or a local's Social Services paperwork didn't go through and now they might be stripped of their medication, and a local charity stopped half-way through paying some guy's bills and now he needs help before he becomes homeless. It's our job to help those kinds of people.\n\nSo I imagined, three years ago when I signed my name on a slip of creamy light-khaki colored paper that told me to swear to protect and preserve the Constitution of this state. So I have experienced, anyway, once or twice. Although we don't really get that many cases in my office specifically, we do get them once in a blue moon. The time in between those long, dreary, weeks-long stints of boredom and hypocritical \"civil service\" is spent doing other things. Reddit is popular between my coworker and I, while my Chief of Staff attempts to fix the world and doesn't let us help. He's got a great work ethic, but sometimes it isolates him. \n\nThe office itself is sort of an indicator of our productive output to society. The white-washed walls, now slightly darker due to a rooftop heater expelling black snowflakes of carbon everywhere, smearing black streaks and cracks throughout, encase a small area of roughly 30 square feet. A long, black, rubberized carpet leads from the doorway to the front divider, behind which sits my fellow Redditor. The carpet was supposed to keep the floor generally clean from the assaults of salt and gravel used by the highway department outside. Success has been varied. People rarely come in to warrant having it in the first place. Fluorescent lights indiscriminately illuminate the room, throwing harsh white light over files which haven't moved in an unknown amount of time.  \n\nA single, long, equally as bland corridor stretches the length of the office. The first door, encountered immediately as you begin the trek to the back room, is *the* office. His office. My boss' office. It's small, relatively speaking. Elected officials usually have more spacious rooms, fitted out in all the decorations and rights of splendor which would present an air of authority and governing tradition to those who enter. This all is enforced by the fact that the couch, angled to face the door, forces you by the way it's positioned to awkwardly angle your head towards a large desk, pitted against the opposite wall and arguably taking up the other half of the already claustrophobic room. That's *His* desk. So it says in the paperwork, anyway. The last time he used it was... I can't even remember. I've used it more times than he has. It's great for napping in. A single, lonely portrait of JFK lingers near the corner of it, by the wall. It has the most melancholy expression\n\nFurther down, by about three feet, is another door on the left. The conference room. It's just a conference room. Lit by the same fluorescent lights, stuffing the room with an awkward, immature lighting which reduces any meeting to an almost impolite silence with their intensity. The large, needlessly expensive granite long table is encircled by a number of executive chairs. Each is identical, with the same ass imprint engraved into the depressed seating foam as the one next to it. \n\nAt the end of the hall is a single store room. We technically don't own it. It's donated by the owner of the building. Because of this loophole, we keep all of our election material in there. Legal, but sketchy. The weird-smelling microwave, decrepit minifridge, and pile of assorted plastic silverware is also in there as well. The cleaning crew somehow managed to make that room spotless, while the rest of the office walls are stained black from the soot. \n\nAnd this is the place I work. Five days a week, and now four because of my college classes, I've been coming here for between 3 to four hours a day. I've done this now for three years, and I've grown to appreciate the finer things of government work. I've helped with presidential elections, congressional runs, county legislature campaigns, and State Legislature bids, but nothing prepared me for the irony that is the hypocritical work I don't do on a daily basis. I'll post more, but for those wondering- I'll be chronicling the hypocrisy of my State Legislature office through this account. I've had an itch to begin writing them since last year, and since I'm leaving in five months due to transferring to a four-year university from the one I'm currently in, I think now's a good time. These are the tales from my office.  \n",

        "text": "Little bit of a rant this time about my employer. \n\nI work for a family run electronics chain. I \"run\" the cell phone department (basically the manager, but without the title). I've been in this position for close to 3 years. I got this position through a friend, who was the cell phone department manager at the time. \n\nThere is one guy at this particular store that is pretty much untouchable. He is the typical \"sleazy sales guy\" and is usually one of the top sales guys of the entire company, which puts him on the map with the big boss. We shall call him DB (douchebag for short). \n\nIn the time I have been employed with this company, I have witnessed DB, shout, threaten, intimidate, harass, bully AND physically throw a punch at employees (he had to take anger management classes for the punch. It never actually connected). This guy also steals sales. As we are commissioned, it's a pretty big deal for the person that loses the sale. I've personally lost $10,000 gross profit deals (we get 25% of gp). Management ignores it and makes provisions for DB. I've even been told that everyone else BUT him are replaceable. \n\nI have seen 4 people leave the company because they cannot work with DB. 2 of them were hired after me, 1 was the previous store manager! I have spoken to clients that refuse to shop our store after buying from him. This week I overheard him complaining to a coworker that he should have \"charged more\" for a certain TV as it was worth way more than $1000. He sold it to a little old lady, who for some reason, loves the guy. If only she knew!\n\nFast forward to last month. Big boss visits our store (will call him BDB for bigger douche bag). Decides to \"have a chat\" since the cell department isn't making him enough money (mainly because he cut back on the cell department's commission 6 months ago, but hey, that shouldn't matter...). Until last month, DB was not permitted to go near cell or satelitte sales as he's, well, an idiot and would screw up the contracts. So BDB in his infinite wisdom, decides that DB can \"pre-sell\" to a client and expect a cut from the sales person he sends the client to. Basically giving DB more money for less work and forcing me (sucker) to do it with a smile. BDB also hired an extra person for the cell department so the pie could be split even thinner than it already is. \n\nFast forward to this month. Note this is the 6th. DB has been passing deals to the newbie, knowing that the newbie will just gladly pass him his cut, but newbie doesn't KNOW how to actually do the job, so newbie comes to me for help. DB has already claimed his percentage, so in our pos, we can split things to 2 people. So now, I do ALL the work, for free! Newbie is currently sitting pretty at $450+ while I'm sat at $45. Go figure. Guess I should \"up my game eh?\". \n\nDB continues to give these deals to my coworkers while I'm sat at the desk, basically sitting on facebook thinking \"f**k you!\". Am I bitter? Damn right! I have been treated like cr@p with this company from this guy, the store manager and upper management for a long time. I have been insulted in front of clients. Have had my disability blatantly made aware of TO clients (I have a fake eye, which usually doesn't get noticed). I have been manipulated into handing over deals to DB, repeatedly. Been told I can ONLY sell cell phones while EVERYONE else can sell anything. The list is on-going.\n\nTo quote Milton... \"I'm gonna burn this place down!\"\n\n\nThanks for listening. Feels a little better.",
