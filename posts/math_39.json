For many construction problems just having equal angles can do the job (for example constructing a tangent to a circle using the opposing equal angle property of an inscribed triangle doesn't require you to draw a radius that might get in the way later on.) \n\nmaybe Americans have learned how to do this but you can construct equal angles by drawing equal size circles around the target points, then setting the compass to the distance between the intersections of the sides of angle A and drawing the intersection onto the circle around B to get the same angle.\n\nIt might seem irrelevant but since i didn't learn it i just wanted o let people know since construction can take up a lot of precious time in competitions so shortcuts are nice.\n\nsome links to geogebra files i made to show the concept visually:\n\nthe basics of the method: [https://www.geogebra.org/calculator/abzznmsz](https://www.geogebra.org/calculator/abzznmsz)\n\nusing the method to draw a tangent to a circle: [https://www.geogebra.org/calculator/arv7fyca](https://www.geogebra.org/calculator/arv7fyca)",

I have some understanding and experience with calculus(derivatives, integrals, Taylor expansions, DEs), complex numbers(De Moivre's theorem, roots of unity, vectors in the argand diagram, Eulers form), proofs, and other high school maths topics. Are there any super interesting books that you would recommend for someone at my level? I'm currently reading about complex analysis, but I just want to know more about maths!",

In fact by definition R(G) \nis unbounded. \nNow lets attempt to prove that the subsequence along R(G) converges to y.\nLet U be a neighbourhood of y then there exists k in G such that for all g&gt;k we have y_g in U.\n**now assume that G is totally ordered**\nthen for n &gt; R(k) where n in R(G) we have that n=R(g) for some g in G.\nNow assume g not &gt; k, thus g&lt;=k then R(g)&lt;= R(k) a contradiction.\nSo we learn that g &gt; k and thus x_n = y_g in U.\nSo the subsequence converges to y.\n\nWe see that the proof only breaks down if we assume that G is not totally ordered (and that it has no totally ordered subnet, so maximal chains in G must not be unbounded).\n\nSo in fact the possible non-linearity of the directed set plays a huge role and is not just some \"additional\" generalisation while we are at it.\n\nWith a little bit of thought I also found an example of a compact space X where the filter of neighbourhoods of any point x has no totally ordered base.\nThis space is the real numbers with the co-finite topology.\n(Interestingly the question whether a neighbourhood filter in the co-countable topology has a totally ordered base is equivalent to the continuum hypothesis)\n\nThe problem with my example is that it is not Hausdorff so convergence of nets is not very interesting as limits are not unique.\n\n**so here is my question: are there any Hausdorff spaces X such that for a point x in X there is no totally ordered base of the neighbourhood filter at x?**",

It took me a long time to realize what the problem is, but I think I finally have pinpointed it; I've noticed that I have this bad habit of not knowing when to stop reading as I never feel like I know enough to tackle a problem. \n\nFor example, my research is pretty far from algebra, and say for some reason something involving group theory appears in a paper I am reading or in a theorem I need to prove. Because I am not an algebraist, I would spend weeks (sometimes months) reading books on group theory. I keep reading and reading but I never feel like I know enough to actually do the proof I originally set out to do. When I was taking classes it was a little easier because the instructor only has you read certain sections of a textbook and so you know when to stop reading. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to overcome this? It has been really hindering my research progress.",

I'm considering switching majors to a double major in genetics and applied mathematics but I wanted to make sure that my goals are reasonable. I know that being a math major requires different skills than lower level math classes but I took a discrete math course where we worked on proofs and I thought they were pretty satisfying to do so I think I'll enjoy math a bit more than my current major.

My subjects till second year were Physics, Math and Statistics. I did my major in Physics but I'm considering taking up some degree where I can learn math and programming for masters. I've heard about applied mathematics and I'm wondering if that would be a good area for me? \n\nYou might ask why I majored in Physics if I was interested in Math. During the time I did my Bachelor's, I had research in Physics as a career option but after studying it for a whole year and working on a small research project, I realised I didn't enjoy it much? \n\nHas anyone else switched from physics to math? Do you have any areas of study which would be more into math and programming? Any advice is appreciated! \n\nSorry, this might be a very incoherent post. I've just started thinking and researching about this, and the whole topic has been confusing.",

Including but not limited to how you read and/or write papers, thinking about potential problems and ideas, and so on?\n\nThank you!",

Currently the topic I've chosen is \"To what extent can game theory be applied in the field of insurance pricing?”\n\nThere are several issues with issues with this question:\n- It’s way too broad. I’d have to narrow it down significantly in order for it to be viable\n- Risk of not focusing enough on maths: I can’t use too much business management/economics terminology because then it wouldn’t be a maths extended essay! However since I’ve already submitted my subject choice to my school there’s no going back - I have to do the research paper on maths.\n- Knowledge constraints: the Extended Essay is expected to take 40 hours. I’m willing to spend about 120 hours on this,nevertheless there’s simply way too many complicated things out there so I’d need my topic to be relatively simple\n\nConsidering all of this,I'd really appreciate feedback on potential financial mathematics research questions! Thanks your input is much appreciated",

Is this a property of all triangles? It would seem that for a triangle ABC, there is a smaller triangle A/2 B/2 C/2 that can be tiled to fill ABC. So maybe I'm answering myself.",
