        "text": "Last April, I went on a walk and stopped by a fast food joint. It was a Saturday night, so it was pretty slow. Just 2 or 3 other people waiting for their order. I ordered my burger and fries and stepped to the side to wait.\n\nWhile waiting, I saw a sign over the apple pie warmer. Said something like, \"If we don't recommend an apple pie at the time of your order, get one for free!\"\n\nI wave over the manager, who happened to be walking by. I ask, \"Don't I get a free apple pie with this?\"\n\nShe says, \"What?\"\n\nI say, \"Yeah. Sign over there says, 'If we don't recommend an apple pie at the time of your order, get one for free!' \"\n\nA girl who was also waiting for her order laughs. The manager stares at the sign.\n\nLong story short: I get a free apple pie. So does everybody else waiting.\n\nI wasn't a douche about this. Promise. I thanked the manager and I wasn't condescending. ",

        "text": "\nJust astounding.  So I ordered something at work to be delivered to my work address.  For work, not personal.  On a company credit card.  The shipper messed up the address, and didn't respond to my request for the tracking number.  When I finally called and got it, I saw that the package had gone on an amazing journey around our city - first to the wrong address, then back to a center, then to our old address, then back to the center.  So I called brown delivery service.  They have this policy that they only trust the shipper.  If you're the recipient, they want you to verify the delivery address.  But the address was wrong and I don't know this arbitrary wrong address.  I only know the company's correct address.  Anyway we go round and round and they finally agree that it would be good to try sending the package to the right address.  I hang up with the CSR, later get on chat because this is a multi-thousand dollar thing and it took 8 weeks to make.  I try hard to verify the updated delivery address, chat CSR says yes the address is fixed delivery will be tomorrow.   Shipper also contacts me apologizing and saying she contacted brown and made sure it was fixed.\n\nSince the story is here you know what happened next.  I'm at my desk working and the tracking updates to 'delivered - porch'.  WTF?  There's no porch here.  Proof of delivery has only the town which is not here.  I get on chat again and after more \"verify the address\" shenanigans they confirm the package was delivered - to MY HOME.  WTF again?  More and more chat and I find out their policy is to look up the NAME of the recipient in public records and try that address, ignoring little things like \"company name\" on the next line, or the fact that signature delivery was expected.  Mind boggling.  \n\nHere is the chat guy's response to why the changes were ignored:\n\n\"I can see the request you made when you contacted us, the request was not completed by the center, as a result the address didn't get updated to the address you corrected it to. \"",

        "text": "The weekend before last I tried watching a movie on-demand on cable, which I've done many times before. I was enjoying the movie until a part a little over an hour in where a blue screen popped up for a few seconds and then the movie restarted but the timer didn't restart so it showed like it was still playing the movie. I tried multiple times to rewind and play over but the issue kept happening. Also it was a movie I couldn't fast forward through so I had to play it and wait to get to that part again to see if it was fixed. It was VERY annoying. \n\nSo I went to a social media and wrote on the cable company's page about my experience and within minutes I had replies about the issue and they said they would look into it. It was the next day when I tried it again that I noticed the movie restarted at the same point but after a later commercial break it continues on with about 10-12 minutes missing and being replaced by the start of the movie. I wrote back to them to let them know it was probably an issue with the movie file when it was uploaded or something like that (The only thing I could think that it might be). They said they'd pass it on.\n\nIt's been a week since last hearing from them and just yesterday while I was working I got a voicemail from the cable company thanking me for letting them know about the issue and that it is fixed now. \n\nI won't be trying to watch the movie again because I saw the ending even though I missed those 10 minutes. I appreciate them letting me know the issue has been resolved. I hope everyone else that tries to watch that movie in the future won't have the same problem. Thanks cable company for following up.",

        "text": "So if you don't know this company, they are basically the largest cell phone insurance providers in the US. They represent all these service provider companies: http://i.imgur.com/bIuCXxD.png\n\nSo I drop my phone and the screen slightly cracks. I don't care about the tiny crack, but the screen won't turn on at this point. \n\nI go to \"Cell phone store\"  where I got my phone and they say we have an insurance policy so to file a claim on insurance company's website. They told me I would get my phone next day, believe it or not! Also all over insurance company's website they boast next day phone delivery. \n\nSo I file a claim, and get a message saying they won't replace the phone, but that I need to take it to cell phone service provider's repair shop. I drive the 30 minutes out of the way to the repair shop to get it fixed. \n\nThe repair shop man tells me he won't fix it, and that they don't do that and I need to go to insurance co. I tell him what already happened and we both try to call insurance co. together to get it sorted. OOOPS! They are down for maintenance, better try again later. \n\nI try online again 4 hours later and I get the same results (go to your cell phone provider's store). So I finally get through to someone on the phone and explain the situation. \"No problem, we can get you your phone tomorroW!!\" they say. I give them all my info. They state that they won't ship to my P.O. box on file so I give them my home address. All is going well. \n\nUntil we are about to hang up and she stops and says my account has a hold on it and we need to wait 24 hours before moving any further. WTF? I pay my bills *religiously*. Never late once. In fact I have a $300 credit on my account because I *overpaid*. \n\nSo I go back to the cell phone store and say \"WTF is going on...why do I have a hold on my account, why is this whole process so fucked up when people must break their phones EVERY FUCKING DAY!\" (I was polite to the employees, this is in my head thoughts haha) \n\nSo I get the store manager to call insurance co. and figure this out for me. They finally, after an hour of back and forth confusion about who should replace the phone and what is wrong with it, say they will cover it, but that they will call us in 24 hours when they have finished processing the claim. \n\nThe next day they call and say we are suspected of fraud because that first day, I went on the website and tried to submit the claim again. (after the first claim failed) They need us to wait 24 hours for them to \"process\" this info. \n\nThey call us the next day and say \"Ok well when you were on the phone before, you only had a P.O. box and you gave us another address but it is wrong\" \n\nI verify that the address is indeed correct and get this gem in return \n\n\"No sir, that address is to a mailbox. Not a door\" \n\nErm, well yeah we have a mailbox outside our house? \n\n\"No, sir we need to deliver it *to a house* not a mailbox\" \n\nWell that is my house address as well...wtf? Put it at the door or the mailbox, idc. I need a phone. \n\nSo he says \"Ok, fine. It will take us 24 hours to process the new address and verify that we can ship to it\" \n\nSo WTF is going on with this fucking company!? \n\nIt's been 7 days since I first filed a claim and I still don't have a damn phone. \n\n***TL;DR*** Cell phone insurance company dicks me around for 7 days, constantly needs \"24 hours to process\" things that should instantly be put in a computer and registered, and in general made arguably THE MOST COMMON phone breakage into the most difficult fucking process ever. You would think they would have done this stuff before...ya know?",

A will be associate, A2 will be associate 2, Me will be, well me \n\n&gt;A: ok i'll need to make sure we have this is stock i'll be right back.\n\n&gt;Me: ok no problem\n\nA makes his way back \n\n&gt;A: Great news we have this in stock but the bad news is this is a fork lift load.  \n\nA starts to input the number for the item and gets half way into it when....\n\n&gt;Me: So this would be a bad time to tell you i have a hatch back huh??\n\nKeep in mind i said it completely serious and in a sheepish tone giving the impression i know i screwed up.

        "text": "So today my mom told me this story and I thought I'd share it.\n\nSo my parents decided to eat out at family dining restaraunt near their house. Apparently that day the place decided to give them issues.\n\nSo my parents had ordered their meals. The first issue came with my dad's food. He had ordered a medium steak, and the steak the waitress brought out was super well done. My parents let the waitress know. She apologized and took the plate back. Should have been easy enough.\n\n\nNope.\n\n\nIt took them over half an hour to even start cooking the steak. My parents knew because they were sitting close enough to the kitchen to hear the poor waitress keep telling the kitchen to start cooking my dad's steak! They heard her tell them multiple times. By the time the steak arrived, my mom had already finished her food and told the waitress just to box my dad's food to go.\n\n\nThe waitress kept apologizing and offered to give them a free dessert on her. My parents declined and said it wasn't necessary for her to give them a dessert on her just because of the kitchen.\n\n\nSo my parents paid. My mom put the tip on her card with the meal. She always marks in her book what she spends. So she knew what she paid. Well. Mom checked her credit statement at the end of the month, and sure enough the total was off. The restaraunt never added the tip! The poor waitress never got her tip.\n\n\nSo do you know what my parent's did? They went to the restaurant and asked for the specific waitress to speak with her. They then hand her cash. She's confused and asked why. My parents explained what happened. She told them they didn't have to, but they told her they wanted to and it was the right thing to do.\n\nTl;dr: kitchen messed up a steak, took forever to start cooking new one after waitress kept telling them to start the damn steak. Restaurant jipped waitress out of her deserved tip, parents make it right.",

This morning, I rushed into a huge chain drugstore near my law school to pick up some last minute things to give myself a manicure. I was running a little bit behind schedule, not too bad, but I was rushing around the store as a result. One employee, who greeted me, playfully commented about it. They were very chipper this morning, which I really appreciated! I laughed along and finished gathering my manicure stuff.  \n  \nWhen I got to the register, the same employee that greeted me started ringing up my ridiculous amount of nail supplies. We ended up getting into a fun conversation about nails and doing them yourself (I ended up teaching her how to remove a no-chip mani on her own!). However, when she got to the very last item of my pile, we realized it had no UPC or anything identifiable on it. She apologized and said she knew I was in a rush, but that she would have to do a price check. I told her it wasn't her fault at all and to go ahead! It honestly didn't bother me that much - so what if I was a few minutes late to class today!  \n  \nWhile we waited, we continued to chat about nails. The price check took maybe 3 minutes tops, not a huge deal at all. My final total came out to around $38 or $39. I was ready to pay when the associate stopped me and said, \"here's a discount because you waited! Thanks for being so patient!\" My total came down to about $31 after the discount. It was such a small, sweet gesture and it really brightened my morning as well. I'm going to call the manager later and compliment the employee...as soon as I get out of class ;)  ",

        "text": "This happened to me just last night so I am still in full rage and will be filing a complaint soon. I should also just say that I live in a not so nice neighbourhood and they cant often find my home.\n\nLast night i was a craving a good pizza, looking at my options it was either some kebab shop or Mahjong, if i order in the next 40 odd minutes off course. Its 12am and everything is going fine, i order my pizza online and I expect to wait about 30 minutes. (usually less but its late) 30 minutes go by and nothing has changed on the tracker, a little concerning but they are just busy. Within 10-15 minutes the tracker updates to say its out for delivered. Awesome, im starting to get super hungry and slightly concerned here as the store is technically closed and I dont know if I will be able to call up if anything happens.\n\n40 minutes go by and I am starting to stress out, I have no idea where this pizza is but the driver hasnt called me to ask for directions. I gave it ten more minutes before I called. At this point its an hour and 30 minutes late and the tracker is stating that its being delivered. I call hoping that I get an answer.\n\nMahjong Employee: Mahjong, (lets call her emma) emma speaking, how can I help?\n\nMe: Hi, I ordered a pizza about 1hour and 30 minutes ago, it hasnt been delivered and the tracker is telling me it has.\n\nEmma: Whats your address?\n\nMe: (gave address)\n\nEmma: Okay well actually the driver has just gotten back now so let me ask him for you. I will put you on hold, give me a minute.\n\nOkay so I am a little hopeful that I will get a good resolution out of this, she seems resonable, a bit of back and forth happens, asking some small questions.\n\nEmma: Okay well the issue was he couldnt find your address so after awhile he decided to come back.\n\nMe: Well its quite commen that you guys cant find my address but why didnt he call me?\n\nEmma: Well to be fair he has bad english.\n\nMe: Thats not an excuse....\n\nEmma: Oh no it isnt.\n\nMe: So why didnt he call.\n\n(To the driver) Emma: Why didnt you call?\n\nWell now I know I am fucked to all hell, this shouldnt need to be asked infront of me. \n\nEmma: (gave some bs excuse about my number being incorrect which is a lie. My number was correct and they called that number later on)\n\nAt this point me and Emma argue for a bit, about what they can offer me. She offers me a refund but no pizza or £10 off on my next delivery but I have to call up the store and it has to be past 11pm or they cant deliver to me. (there is a closer store that handles my address up to that time at night) I say thats not good enough but I accept the pizza, i am starving and everywhere else is just about closed. Bad decision on my part. Right before i put the phone down she wants my information and I tell her to not bother and that i wont call up again and that she is basically punishing me when the driver cant do his job.\n\n30 minutes go by and I am super pissed off. I am fighting the urge to shout at Emma. I call up again, she says that its on its way. Yeah okay. A few minutes later, some random guy I dont know who I assume works for Mahjong asks me for my address saying he is trying to direct the pizza guy, this guy says it will be 20 minutes.\n\nLonger than that goes by and I just say fuck it and I walk about 5 minutes away from where I live, so not too far. The pizza is 2hours and 40 odd minutes late. I see the guy walking around outside what I assume is squinting at road signs trying to decipher the strange code of the english language. He tries to say something to me, it makes no sense. He points at the Mahjong menu and my address, I point and say I live down there and that I walked. He attempts to pronounce my street but it sounds like gobbly goop. He cant prounce anything past the first letter,\n\nI get home, the pizza feels pretty cool, I open it up and it looks like they messed up my order. I ordered a medium pizza, with extra cheese, extra sauce and ham. What I got looked like a small awkwardly portioned up to 8 slices (as per the definition of their medium pizzas) with maybe half the amount of sauce and most of it on one side. This pizza looks like something left in a car for nearly 3 hours. I eat most of this disgusting pizza. The end.\n\nSorry if my grammar is terrible and let me know if there is anything I need to change. I am in a bit of a rush and still very angry.\n\nEdit: I guess this post is large. Sorry!! I didnt realise thats how it worked here.",

        "text": "A couple of months ago, I decided to walk over to a very well known super store that has just expanded their grocery department. It was the only one of this brand within feasible walking or driving distance, so it was always very popular as people from the next three or so towns would come there to do their shopping. \n\nOn this particular day they were giving out free samples of some kind of biscuit. Awesome, I'm up for that, I head over. There's a big crowd of people around the stand where a lady is handing out samples. Little kids, adults, teenagers, it's basically impossible to tell who's with who, the lady's just handing the stuff out and then moving on to the next customer.  \n\nI finally find myself by the front and am about to have my sample handed to me when the lady looks at me, frowns and then snatches the toothpick impaled slab of chocolatey glory away from me. \n\nL - How old are you?\n\n\nMe - 16\n\nL - Where's your parents?\n\nI explain that I walked here by myself and my parents are at home.\n\nL - Then I can't give this to you.\n\nMe - Why not?\n\nL - You need to be 18 or have a parent with you. I don't know your allergies, I'm not being held responsible for you. \n\nMe - I don't have any allergies?\n\nI know it seems kind of a petty thing to be arguing over, but I really wanted the chocolate.\n\nL - I don't know that. So I can't give it to you. You'll have to buy it.\n\nI repeated that I didn't have any allergies a couple more times, and then walked away. Still not sure how it would be okay for me to buy it from them instead of having a sample, given that my non existent allergies would remain unchanged. \n\nAnd yes, I understand that it's probably company policy to not give samples to minors or without parental permission, but surely that only applies when the kid is &lt;10, not of driving age, and she was definitely giving them out to kids under five without asking them where their parents were. \n\nStill a little confused about the logic on this one.  \n\n",

        "text": "I went to a lingerie store (it is ubiquitous in the U.S. and uses a lot of pink) to try on some yoga pants they were selling. I know their sales associates always try to get customers to do a bra fitting, but the lady at the changing room was pushy and obnoxious to the extreme.  \n  \n  She asked me what size bra I wore, and I replied that I was only interested in yoga pants today and was not planning on buying a bra. I didn't want to talk about my bra size in a semi-public area for no good reason. Unsatisfied, she started to hassle me with variations of \"Well what size do you wear from other stores? Come on, tell me. I just want to know.\" After several unsuccessful attempts at politely changing the subject, I got annoyed and started answering with \"I'm just here for yoga pants today\" in a Marshawn Lynch-like manner.  \n  \n  A while later, she finally decides that it's a bad idea to keep the customers behind me waiting, so she gives me a changing room. Before closing the curtains, she pulls out a pair of the smallest sized bras they stock from the pile of fitting room rejects and throws it on the floor. She said, \"You can try these on while you're in there. They look like your size.\" Now anyone who's bought a bra before knows that it's inaccurate to look at a person, especially one who's wearing loose fitting clothes, and eyeball their bra size. The bra was the wrong size and kind of ratty and dubious-looking. I don't know why she thought throwing it on the dirty floor would make me want to try it on.  \n  \n  Once I try on the yoga pants, I decide that I like them but hate the sales lady so much that I won't give the store any money. She asks me if I tried on the bra when I walk out, no inquiries at all about whether I liked the yoga pants. Of course, I respond with \"Nope, I'm just here for yoga pants today.\"  \n  \n  As I'm leaving, I notice the sales lady had scribbled some stuff onto a form that they fill out when a customer gets a bra fitting. I figured she probably made up some numbers and filled out the form so that she could lie to the manager about having helped me with a bra fitting. So I go home, write a nasty email to corporate about the entire experience, and get a vaguely apologetic response saying that they were going to retrain the employees but couldn't tell me what they were going to do.  \n  \n  I understand that the sales associates of this nationwide chain are pressured to do bra fittings and sympathize with them. However, this sales lady was trying to brow-beat me into it. Had she asked nicely and explained that she had a weekly quota, I would've at least pretended to try on the bra. She also could've at least done her job by trying to sell me yoga pants. I'm boycotting this company for the rest of my life.",

        "text": "So I decided I wanted to build an AR15 rifle. \n\nIf you are unaware, an AR15/M16/M4 rifle basically consists of two main assemblies. The upper receiver has the barrel, bolt, and charging handle. The lower receiver has the trigger, pistol grip, and butt stock. \n\nLegally in the US, the lower receiver is the only part that counts as a firearm and this is where the serial number is located. You can order any parts straight to your house except for the lower receiver. The lower receiver has to be shipped to a FFL dealer and picked up at that location. These dealers then charge a transfer fee to the buyer, they complete the background check, and do all the legal paperwork. \n\nSo I ordered my lower from a company. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post which one, I loved their customer service so if I can I will edit this and say who they are. \n\nThey give me tracking information and ship the lower the same day I order it. Sweet!\n\nI eagerly await about a week. I check tracking data 3 or 4 times a day. Finally it arrives. I'm at work, it's 0800 in the morning, but it says its delivered. \n\nAfter work I get home, shove my kids in the car, and drive to the very well known big box outdoor equipment store to pick up the lower. \n\nI get to the fire arms counter and politely ask about my lower receiver. The gentleman behind the desk is like, \"your what?\". My lower receiver for an AR15. His response, \"did we call you to tell you it had arrived?\". Well, no. \"It takes 24 hours for us to unload it off the truck and get it ready to transfer\". Okay, no problem, I'll come back tomorrow. \n\nNext day. They don't call me. I'm busy so I can't go by and pick it up anyway. \n\nNext day. They don't call me. After work I call them and ask. \"Did we call you?\" is the response. Um, no... But the tracker shows it arrived and that $Bob signed for it. \"We don't have anyone named $Bob working here and we will call you when it arrives. It's not here yet.\" He hangs up the phone. \n\nUm. Okay.. \n\nNext morning. I call store and ask for a manager. I say, Tracking software shows this arrived three days ago and it was signed for by $Bob. \"Did we call you?\". Um, no.... But I've called you several times and there is a signature for this item. \"Let me look into it.\", he hangs up. \n\nUmm, okay?...\n\nI call the company I order the lower receiver from. They are awesome. Lady on the phone says she will call the store personally. I get a phone call from the store not even 15 minutes later. \n\nStore manager: \"Uh, yeah, we found your lower and its ready for you to pickup.\"\n\nGreat, I'll be by tonight. \n\nLady calls me back immediately afterwards. Turns out, it had arrived when the tracker showed it. The company does have an employee named $Bob who works at their shipping and receiving department. $Bob, who works for one of the largest outdoor retailers in the US doesn't know what a lower receiver is, signed for it, took legal responsibility for a firearm, and promptly set it aside somewhere and forgot about it. It had been sitting for three days. \n\nBest part. I show up that night to pick it up. I wait in line very impatiently. There are three employees, one is helping a customer, the other two are just talking to each other. I wait for them to finish with their customer, an attractive lady comes by, and when they finish with the customer they go to her next even though I was there first. \n\nFinally, I get up to the desk, and ask about my lower receiver. Their response, \"did we call you?\". ",

        "text": "The following happened a few years ago, but still sticks out in my mind as one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever encountered.\n\nWhat you should know: laptop in question is an ASUS i5 unit, one of their bamboo line which I bought as a demo unit from a big box retailer at the end of this lines life cycle. This all happens within a year of purchase. Also: I practise safe IT, so before bringing the laptop into the store I threw in a spare HDD and did a fresh install of Windows on it - completely barebones except for a few utilities (AV and such).\n\nSo one day I wake up feeling a bit sick and groggy, all stuffy and nasty as I lay in bed contemplating if I should just roll over and die or if I should do something with my day. The first option was chosen and I rolled over to boot up my laptop to watch some sweet, sweet Youtube videos all day while I lay in bed sick on this otherwise beautiful summer's Saturday. Fast forward a number of hours of watching HD content and I start to notice the fan on the laptop going like the clappers! I've heard it going this fast once or twice before, but only after asking it to render some video or while playing a demanding game, but it was still rare to hear it at all to be honest. Well time had come for me to actually do something since death wasn't on the cards this day in particular. Shut the laptop off to cool down, moved to the sofa and spent the rest of the day watching Youtube there. I know, exciting life, right?\n\nNext morning, Sunday, I'm still feeling a bit pukeish so decide to once again lay down and watch some cat videos. Laptop POST's, but fan is now spinning at 100%, constantly. Strange I thought, so let's do some digging! Nothing makes me feel better than a mystery, especially when it's computer related. Diagnostics, tests, and physical inspections take up the majority of the day and the result is clear: the heatpipe for the CPU has broked. Fan is spinning at full tilt, but there is no heat on the radiator for it to do anything about, so the CPU is hitting 100c almost instantly and thermally throttling if not crashing outright. (in layman's terms: the thermal management system had failed physically)\n\nMonday morning I call the store I bought it from to see if there was still warranty on the unit. Result: yes! Let them know I am coming by after work and jot the employees name down. We'll call him $Joe. I manage to stop by as stated, drop the laptop off with $Joe, get some paperwork, and I am on my way after being told that it should only be about a week - tops.\n\nOne week goes by. Phone didn't ring. Another week - still no ring. So I call them to enquire about the status of my laptop \"Still in for repairs, but we expect it back soon\". Another week. \"I'm sorry, but it's not back yet.\" Another bloody week \"Any day now, I promise.\" It's been over a month at this point and I am getting a little upset over this whole thing, especially since I could have bought the broken part for $20 on eBay and had it shipped from China by now. But I waited and kept phoning. Another week goes by, another phone call by me \"Oh, yeah your laptop is right here, you want to come by today and pick it up?\"\n\nYES.\n\nAt this point I should note that it is roughly 40km out of my way to get to this location, and that I didn't have anything more than a bicycle, so I wasn't wanting to make this trip more than once.\n\nAnyway, after much elation and joy making I leave work early and rush over to the store to grab my laptop. Walk in like a boss, go up to the desk and ask for my property to which I was informed that it had been sitting in the back, fixed, for about a month now and they were wondering why I had waited so long to come pick it up (are you kidding me?). More paperwork was signed and exchanged, details about the issue were covered, and I get my laptop back. For those interested they replaced \"motherboard and CPU assembly\". Go home and fire the thing up: exact same issue. Sigh. Added bonus: they gave me some diagnostic paperwork detailing my system and the software installed. Apparently my AV software (Avast!) was a virus, and Windows Update was incorrectly set to \"Automatic\" which they recommend against and turned off altogether (I mean, who really needs updates to their operating system, am I right?).\n\nConfused and annoyed at this point I call the store again and request to talk to $Joe, explain the situation, and he apologises profusely for it and asks me to come by again with it. No probs, maybe they just missed something or didn't know what they were testing - happens to the best of us!\n\nWell, no. I get to the store the next day with laptop in tow, sit down with one of the other intake techs (we'll call him $Dave) since $Joe wasn't available, and explain the situation. The conversation afterwards went something like this:\n\n&gt;$Dave \"Your laptop cannot be overheating - it passed our very thorough checks.\"\n\n&gt; $Me \"Would you like me to demonstrate?\"\n\n&gt; $Dave \"Okay, but it won't change anything as there is nothing wrong!\"\n\n&gt; $Me ~loads up diagnostic programs and causes laptop to overheat and BSOD while watching a video~\n\n&gt; $Dave \"I don't know what those were, but they're probably viruses. Your laptop is just fine.\" ~holds hand beside fan output after computer is rebooted~ \"Plus it's running cold! The fan is putting out cold air right here, so it cannot be overheating.\"\n\n&gt; $Me \"These are industry standard tools! Surely you've heard of Speedfan before?! Plus the centre of the laptop's keyboard is so hot I cannot touch the keys.\"\n\n&gt; $Dave \"No, I haven't and that's normal. We only use real tools here not stuff we find on the internet. But this is all besides the point, as your laptop is fine and even if it weren't, the warranty ran out months ago.\"\n\nWut?\n\n&gt; $Me \"Yeah, no, I've been told multiple times that it had warranty on it by your own staff - that is the only reason I brought it here in the first place!\"\n\n&gt; $Dave \"No you didn't, nobody said that to you. There is no warranty on it, and the laptop is fine. I don't know what else you want me to do.\"\n\n&gt; $Me \"I want you to fix this. Get me your manager.\"\n\nI'll save you the finer details, but in summary the manager said the same as $Dave did, that the laptop didn't have a warranty and that it was 100% functional because their diagnostics were \"never wrong\". Once again I demonstrated the overheating issue, and once again the person held their hand by the output of the fan and couldn't feel any heat, so they concluded that there was no problem. More bickering. Finally in an attempt to get me out of the store more than anything else I am sure the manager relented and said:\n\n&gt; $Manager \"Just this one time I'll break the rules for you, but in the future you won't get any special treatment. We won't even work on your computer if you need help. You'll effectively be banned from this department.\"\n\nSure, fine, whatever, just fix the damn thing dude! You know the drill by this point: paperwork and signatures everywhere! \n\nTwo weeks later and no phone call. Gave them a ring and was told that they'd gotten it back about a week ago and were waiting on me to come in and pick it up. Still a facedesk moment, but at least it was faster than the first time. Once more I go in and once more I get to fill in more paperwork: but this time I decided to test the machine at the store in front of an employee. What do you know: success! They actually managed to fix it this time.\n\nOnce home I read through the paperwork: replaced HSF and heatpipe unit (you know, the thing that was broken in the first place), formatted the hard drive, reinstalled Windows.\n\nWait, they reinstalled Windows? Yeah, and apparently a lot of other stuff with it. Multiple unkillable processes, multiple uninstallable programs, multiple adware programs, just garbage everywhere. Also: several encrypted folders on the C: drive taking up quite a lot of space. At this point I hadn't even connected to the internet with it, never mind tried to use it, so these programs could ONLY have come from them. And the final kicker: remember when I said this thing is from the ASUS bamboo line? Yeah, a big selling feature is the fact that the case of the laptop is made from bamboo, which is really quite nice aesthetically if a bit pointless. After getting the laptop back though the thing is scratched and gouged like it was the chew toy of a dog. This once expensive bit of aesthetic pointlessness is now looking like scrap wood.\n\nUnsurprisingly enough I've never bought anything from this retailer since nor could I recommend them to anybody other than the criminally insane.",

I paid for it online, so that I didn't have to worry about it later. When I showed up, there was a waiver and a syllabus, and people filling out the waiver so I assumed I needed to as well. I turned it in, and was then asked to pay the fee (which I already did) and this is where my trouble began. For reference, the Customer \"Service\" Rep will be R, I will be Me.\n\n&gt;Me: Okay, so here's the waiver.\n\n&gt;R: Alright, the fee is $80.\n\n&gt;Me: I already paid the fee, though.\n\n&gt;R: Then why did you take a waiver? You didn't need one if you paid already.\n\n&gt;Me: Because it was sitting on the counter, so I thought I needed it. You can throw it away.\n\n&gt;R (apparently forgetting I just told him I paid): Okay, but you need to pay the fee.\n\n&gt;Me: I did, though, online.\n\n&gt;R: That's something different (side note: the class page directs you to the page to pay the fee online), you need to pay the fee.  \n\n&gt;Me (now speaking slower and more clearly): I already paid the fee, online. The class page linked to it, and I paid it.\n\n&gt;R: *stares for a good 3 or 4 seconds\n\n&gt;Me: If there is a separate fee, than what is it?\n\n&gt;R: *continues staring, as if he continued to do so I'd leave\n\n&gt;Me: I can show you the receipt and my checking statement if it would help.\n\nSo I pulled up the receipt and my checking statement, which apparently didn't seem to help. \n\n&gt;R: But did you pay today in person?\n\nAt this point I was amazed. Fortunately the instructor noticed this, as 5 or 6 people had gone through the other CSR while I was still standing there. He came over, so I explained to him that I paid online, and he explained that to the C\"S\"R, who never gave any indication that he even remotely understood what the instructor was talking about, but let the issue drop because it was an instructor talking. Astonishing display, if I do say so myself.\n\n*edited for readability*",

It had been a few months of a harsh winter in the northeast so I went to [Fashion Clothing B] to buy a jacket. Ended up getting a really good deal on a down bomber jacket. It was one of those things you wouldn’t buy if it was full price (too expensive) but who can argue a 70% discount right? Plus the thing was just beautiful.\n\nA few weeks later I go to [Fashion Clothing A] store to window shop. I greet the retail guy (RG) working there (I had shopped there a few times in the past so I kinda knew him), he compliments my fairly new jacket, I smile say thanks and proceed to walk around the store. I stumble upon a nice blazer so I start looking for my size and RG comes over starts telling me about how he’s wanted that blazer for so long (a lil pricy) so he was waiting for it to go on sale next week, etc… I figure I’d give it a go so I take my jacket off, place it on some stool and try on the blazer.\n\nEnter confused guy (CG) with his buddy. As I am trying on the blazer, CG is checking out some clothes and grabs my jacket and starts inspecting it. I don’t think too much of it since I thought he would see the [Fashion Clothing B] tag inside. He probably didn’t since he decided to try it on… Then takes it off, mumbles something to his buddy and starts looking for a price tag. RG is looking from a distance, both of us looking confused… CG starts walking toward the cashier so I promptly follow:\n\n&gt;Cashier: (to CG) Hi did you find everything you were looking for?\n\n&gt;CG: Yeah (places [Fashion Clothing B] jacket on counter.\n\n-Cashier starts looking for tag-\n&gt;Me: Hey… That’s mine…\n\n-Cashier looks back confused-\n&gt;CG: I’m getting that\n\n&gt;Me: No I mean I already “got” it\n-CG looks back confused-\n\n&gt;Me: I bought it at [Fashion Clothing B] store…\n\n-The cashier then hands me my jacket-",

Today I went in to a different location for my other job. I had grabbed some stuff for other job and for myself. Since I had two transactions I did mine first. \nSo a bit of a side note, we always have lots of coupons online but we limit them to customers.\nSo I pull up the first one on my phone and she asks which transition I want to use it on since I can only use it once. No biggie, decide to wait and use it on my second transaction since I also had a coupon for some stuff I was specifically getting in my transaction. So she finishes and I tell her about my coupon: \nMe: okay and I have this coupon for the stickers\nCashier: and this one is a different one? \nEven though it states it right above the barcode what it's for. So after I pull out my employee discount. \nSo for our discounts we have cards that have a place for our name, signature, and ID number. I didn't have mine filled out since no one ever told me we had to and any time I've rung up my coworkers they have always been blank too. \nC: this isn't filled out. \nMe: oh! Sorry I never had a problem before. I can do it right now do you have a pen? \nSo I start filling it out and I ask what exactly do they need for employee ID. She doesn't answer me so I start explaining that like I know my number for the computer and all that but I'm not sure what number they want. \nC: it's the number on your clock in card. \nMe: oh, I don't know that number. \nC: well that's the number you need. \nAt this point her voice is getting more and more annoyed with me and I'm trying to stay calm. \nC:what store do you work at? \nMe: (town) \nC: how long have you been there?\nSo I tell her like 6 weeks. By now there's 4-5 people in line behind me. So finally she says \nC: okay well I'll do it now but I'm going to call (town) and talk to them. \nThe way she said it was like she's doing me some huge favor. \nShe wasn't happy when I had her do it again for the second purchase. \n\nJust some things I should add:\nI'm assuming she's the manager and that is some sort of formality but not only was I never told about filling out my employee card, I was never told to check others when they use them in stores. \nSecondly, she would have just looked at it and scanned it had it been filled out so I don't get why she was making it a bigger deal then it was. \nThird, I've gone to other locations before and used it without any problems. The other store the cashier was even friendlier when she found out I worked at another one. ",

I have a day off today and to relax, me and a couple pals went down to our local pub for a few drinks. The staff at this particular pub are familiar with us and have always been friendly as can be and we've returned the kindness with more kindness. So it's fairly empty surprisingly as this is a popular joint for both young and old patrons and after finishing our first round, I volunteer to go up and get the next one in. Two of the regular barmaids are on shift by themselves at this time, we'll call them Rachel and Sophie. \n\nBoth of them greet and me and we ended up talking for a while, bare in mind Sophie was behind the bar getting the drinks and Rachel was on the customer side near me cleaning some pint glasses. All's well until a Ned of around 45 years old at a guess walks up who's obviously quite drunk, now if you're not familiar with the term Ned, a Ned is a Scottish slang word for Chav, and if you don't know what a Chav is, it's one of these lovely gents\n\n http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v233/thelittleredone/neds.jpg\n\nWe'll call this guy Perverted Prick or PP for short. PP stumbles over and the following conversation ensues. \n\nPP: Alright hen? How're you dain tonight?\n\nRachel: I'm good thanks, you?\n\nNow I'm in a relationship, I'll say that Rachel is a good looking girl but I wouldn't be interested for obvious reasons, she's probably used to getting these kind of people so I didn't say anything at first but when he started getting a bit creepy, that's when I intervened. \n\nPP: Aw aye am good, where're ya goin tonight then?\n\nRachel: Home. \n\nPP proceeds to lurch forward and tried grabbing her while muttering about taking her home tonight. \n\nI proceeded to step forward and give him a not so gentle push away from her.\n\nMe: What do you think you're playing at pal?\n\nPP: Aw see you, am gonna fukin burst ya if you dinne get out ma face. \n\nMe: Aye I'll fucking do the same to you if you don't stop harassing girls half your age, now do me a favor and leave you fucking fruit loop.\n\nI'm not the biggest guy in the world, around 5\"11 and about 175 lbs(or 12 and a half stone) but I wasn't afraid to get this sexual deviant out of there if I had to, reason I reacted so badly is my younger sister used to work in a bar when she was 18 and on more than one occasion she had drunken lunatics like this guy on her case trying to get her number and asking her very inappropriate questions so I feel like I  was justified in what I did. \n\nLuckily the guy left with the assistance of one of the door men, I was shaking with adrenaline and Rachel offered me a free drink on the house for that, I insisted I pay and gave her a £10 tip for the inconvenience.

        "text": "Just as a disclaimer, I've worked in retail and find it very reasonable for an employee not to know every product a store carries. I also understand that employees may be expected to up-sell their customers. But I think there is a certain level of ignorance after which it becomes unacceptable, especially when it's coupled with a complete failure to listen to the customer while going for a hard sell. \n\nAnyway, this happened over the weekend and I feel the need to vent. If my frustration is unreasonable, feel free to call me out on it.\n\nSo. I have an old iPhone 3 that I use in the car just for music. Its cable stopped working, so I went online to see if any stores still carry compatible  cables (the 30-pin to USB kind) as newer models' cables are different. I find a nearby big-box store that has some in stock. They aren't Apple brand, but they're way cheaper than I expected (less than $15) so I was quite happy.\n\nI get to the electronics section of the store and an associate immediately came over to ask me if I needed help. Normally, I'd just say \"No, I'm all set\" but he was a \"Wireless Specialists\" (you know, the ones that wear nice clothes instead of the regular uniform), so I figured he'd easily be able to help and told him what I was looking for.\n\nHe had no idea what I was talking about, so as we headed to the Apple products section, I repeated I'm looking for a 30-pin to USB cable compatible with an iPhone 3.\n\n\"Oh, those. Yeah, we don't carry them anymore.\"\n\n*Feh.* \"I just looked on your website and it said you had some in stock. They're not Apple brand though.\"\n\n\"Oh, no. Can't be. We don't carry any 3rd party accessories for iPhones.\"\n\n*Seriously? Well, that's annoying.* I should have looked it up on my phone and showed him, but it didn't occur to me at the time.\n\nHe then grabbed the newer version of the cable (~$30) along with a 30-pin to lightning adapter (for another ~$30) and hands it to me saying, \"This should work. If that's all, I can ring you up over here.\"\n\nThis is of course way more than I was expecting to pay, so I said I was all set. I started hanging the products back up on the rack, and notice the cable I had been looking for is hanging literally in the next section over along with all kinds of 3rd party iPhone accessories. *Sigh.*\n\nI grab one and tell him, \"This is what I was looking for.\"\n\n\"Weird. I had no idea we sold those. Must be new or something.\" \n\nWhat's weirder is that, with this section being twice as big as the Apple product section, a wireless \"specialist\" could have no knowledge of 2/3rds of the products they sold. Maybe he worked on commission and was trying to up-sell me, but I try not to be so cynical. I just wanted get out of the store with a working cable, so grabbed one and turned to head to the front to pay, thinking at least I'm done dealing with this guy.\n\nI get maybe three steps and he yells, \"UH, YO, YOU KNOW YOU STILL NEED TO PAY ME FOR THAT!\" as if I were trying to steal the thing from him specifically. I had paid for electronics at the front registers before, but maybe it's a new policy (or an old one I had been disregarding). But fair enough, although he didn't need to be so rude about it.\n\nSo he's ringing me up and condescendingly mentions how silly it is that I was still using some POS iPhone 3 when he could get me a brand new phone for essentially free. I explain I'm not looking for a new phone and that I just use the old iPhone to listen to music in my car. It doesn't click and he starts his spiel all over again, this time pointing to different phones, explaining their features along with different plans I'd be eligible for. I told him the same thing, and even showed him my quite new Samsung phone. But he keeps interrupting saying, \"Nah, man, just listen\" and went on and on about the brand new, free phones he could hook me up with. \n\n\"Sorry, I'm not interested.\"\n\n\"That's just stupid, man. You're an *idiot* for passing this up.\"\n\n\"Thanks. I'm still not interested.\" \n\nFinally he relented, \"All right, man, it's your loss... SMH,\" while also shaking his head in real life, and handed me my bag and receipt.\n\n*What the hell was that?* I've done some stupid things working in retail, but I've never turned what should have been a 2 minute transaction into a 20 minute shit-show like that. And I've certainly never used chatspeak to a customer. But I'm in my mid-30s and look about a decade younger, so I'm used to people around my age talking down or not listening to me. Still, this was a bit much.",

I went home and told my mom, who gave me a five to pay for the chips.\n\nI went back, apologized again, and bought the chips. I suppose this convinced them I was telling the truth, because their expressions softened. They told me it was alright, that most places would have called the cops, but they didn't want the hassle. Nice people, as I said.\n\nEDIT: Sorry, this was several years ago and I may have it a little mixed up. The five may have been fake, the singles real. I don't remember, but I do remember telling my mom and going back. I also don't remember if they kept the bill(s) or not, and I hadn't until now considered the possibility that I was duped. I do know that I was scared shitless at the time.",

The store opened fairly recently, so the employees weren't too experienced with the system, and our poor cashier was so confused. He kept profusely apologizing even though it wasn't his fault at all. Neither of us were upset or anything, I was kind of embarrassed, but the guy had to have us return everything and then buy it again. I felt *so bad.* The cashier wasn't sure how to do everything, and he had to keep asking his manager, who was at another register. It probably took us ~15 minutes to check out and there was a line (although there were three other registers open so we weren't really holding much up).\n\nFor all retail workers, I apologize for ever being \"that guy.\"",

I receive them through my bank account directly - they appear online and I just press a button to pay.\n\nSo I called customer service, and they immediately acknowledged they had had an issue with their billing system for a few months. Some (many?) customers did not receive any bill and were now sent \"final warning\" letters and fines.\n\nOf course they apologized and took my fine away, like with any other customer who complains.\n\nI am wondering how many customers will not complain, feel guilty and just pay the fine.",

Today i asked for a hot tea and sat down with it. When they came over with my soup, theres a huge bowl of hot coco with it -i dont like hot coco- and said it wasnt mine. The waitress said it was on my bill. Lo and behold theres a $4.00 additive of a hot coco. \n\nI asked her why would i order that when i have a tea in hand? \n\nWas told to go back up to the cashier for a refund. The lady had disappeared and they had to find her. Meanwhile my food is sitting there on its own and likely to be swept up by a waitress in passing. Finally they find her and she realizes that the button for tea and hot coco are beside each other. And that her finger must have slipped. I put my card in for a refund and three times it rejects. Fourth time it works. Turns out their system is buggy today, another customer was having problems. \n\nYeesh! This is more work for such a simple meal!

        "text": "Last year a friend of mine got accepted into a college in Iowa. We are both Canadians from Ontario who both finished our undergrads in April. Starting in December this friend started to ask people to drive with him to the college and I volunteered since I thought it would be cool to see part of the Midwest. We had a week break from school in February so we decided to go then. The drive through Michigan and Indiana was uneventful, we stopped a few times for food, coffee and gas but everyone was very friendly and welcoming. However about 2 hours from the Iowa border we experienced a stone cold bitch of a cashier (SCBC) who gave us one of the worst customer service experiences of our lives.\n\nWe pulled up to a gas station in rural Illinois to fill up for the last time before reaching our destination. My friend had to pee so I wound up browsing around and noticed that beer was sold in this gas station and at an extremely cheap rate. In Ontario alcohol is sold in special government run stores that mark up the cost significantly. The cheapness of this beer made me want to buy a pack to enjoy while we hung out at the hotel that night. I brought the pack to the front where this interaction with SCBC played out.\n\nSCBC: \"Pointscard?\"\n\nMe: \"No.\"\n\nSCBC: \"Birthday?\"\n\nI hesitated wondering what she meant. Did she mean to ask if it was my birthday? Maybe she thinks I am celebrating because I am buying beer?\n\nMe: \"...No?\"\nSuddenly she snatches the beer dramatically and tosses it on the floor behind her,\n\nSCBC: \"Well you are NOT having this!\" she says in the snarkiest manner imaginable.\n\nI was caught off guard by this, my friend came out of the washroom and witnessed it too and was stunned. I composed myself and realized she was probably asking for my ID in a very strange fashion. I handed her my passport.\n\nSCBC: \"What is this? I don't have time for this!\"\n\nShe threw my passport at me. At this point I'm so confused at this lady's behaviour that I probably have the dumbest look on my face.\n\nSCBC: \"Why are you so stupid? Just tell me your birthday!\"\n\nMe: \"Oh, I thought you were asking for ID.\"\n\nSCBC: \"What is your birthday, stupid? I need to enter it on my register, that's it!\"\n\nMe: \"xber 2x, I was confused because you just said birthday, in Canada you have to show ID if you look young. I didn't know you were entering it on your register.\" (At the time I was 22 and probably looked 19, I am quite young looking for my age. The drinking age in USA is 21 so I thought this was reasonable.)\n\nSCBC: \"Well you aren't in Canada anymore now are you?\" (even snarkier than before in a matter of fact type way)\n\nMe: \"No, I'm not.\" \n\nSCBC tosses my change at me causing most of it to drop.\n\nI pick it up and I say \"that was unnecessary\" calmly as the two of us leave.\n\nStill not sure what was up her ass. \n\n\n",

Perfect.\n\n\nWe sit down, the little old lady working the register was absolutely adorable and kept refilling our drinks, coffee, etc. Our waitress takes our order, I get some fried eggs and pancakes, my boyfriend gets country steak and eggs.\n\n\nWe waited about 40 minutes for our food, which normally we don't really mind long waits, it was a busy day, but we had to go to a brewery tour that afternoon.\n\n\nThree different times, our waitress tried to bring us a plate of corned beef hash. All three times we rejected it, saying neither of us ordered it. She came up to us a fourth time, asking what I ordered. I said the eggs and pancakes, my boyfriend the country fried steak. The waitress turns to the food runner and points, walking away. The food runner brings me my eggs and pancakes...and a plate of corned beef hash.\n\n\nWe call the waitress back over and tell her the mistake. She brings the food back, and comes back a few minutes later saying it will take over an hour for the correct order to be ready. We told her we didn't have that time since we had to be at a brewery tour, but that we would take the corned beef hash anyway. It turned out to be some of the best hash we'd ever had.\n\n\nWhen the check came, we had been charged for my meal and the corned beef hash. We told the waitress we didn't feel this was right, that we were willing to pay for my meal and all the drinks, but not my boyfriend's since he never actually got his meal. She took the check back, brought it to our table about five seconds later, the same total outlined in pen. \n\n\nWe brought the check up to the little old lady working the register and explained our situation. She took our check, crumpled it up, gave us a wink, and sent us on our way!\n\n\n\nTL;DR Bad customer service ended in great customer service",

My policy when finding wallets is to open it up and check the ID. Nothing more and nothing less. I don't go rifling through it, I don't go digging through card pockets. I just open it up and see if there's a clear picture of the owner. \n\nI walk into the building and am looking at the inside picture when I realize the face of the owner is the lady at the cafe. I close the wallet and, since she's two feet from me I walk towards her and hold it up.\n\n&gt;Cafe lady: What are you doing with my wallet?\n\nShe barked this at me.

It was pretty darn hot, and it was the middle of the day, so somewhere in the upper 80's or lower 90's for temps, with high humidity. We popped into the shop once, but saw it was WAY busy, so we left and came back about a half hour later when it had cleared out a little.\n\nNow, this shop was setup to look like one of the old-time drugstores/shops, with antiques on the walls and such. There were 5 tables off to one side and a long 'ice cream bar' along the other. The girl behind the 'bar' was the only one in the entire shop, and she was just swamped. We hopped in line and waited patiently as we got to the front. More people just kept coming in. She soldiered on until we got up to the front, then apologized and mentioned she had to make a call to get more help. She was on the phone for ~5 minutes, apologizing about halfway through because of the delay.\n\nSome old guy walked past us while she was on the phone and rather rudely said something about 'getting off the phone' and such. I would have liked to have said something but he walked past too quickly and the shop was getting packed again.\n\nShe finally finished and came back to get our orders, and just kept on working. We ate and moved on, but I wish there was some way we could have given her a tip (It was the kind of place that you pay up front, so no bill or anything really). I do think my dad said something to her about how good of a job she was doing, or that he could relate, but I'm not sure if she heard it.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to thank you again for being awesome about everything! I know how hard you were working and I hope you got to sit down and rest your feet for a while! :)\n",

Also, this is usually the only issue I have with giving my information to people.  \n\nA few weeks ago, I decided to go to my local grocery store’s pharmacy to fill out a new prescription.

She starts insinuating that this isn’t the “correct” prescription, as the doctor who prescribed me the medication was different from the one on my insurance card. I told her I see the doctor that gave me the prescription in her hand for the medication, as I see different doctors for different issues. W was visibly annoyed but didn’t fight it.  \n\nFinally, the information is filled out, I find out my rate for the prescription, I agreed to it, and left it for them to fill. I returned to pick it up a couple of hours later. I walk up to the pick up counter, where a gentleman was working. I’ll refer to him as W2. W2 is much friendlier than W was.  \n\nW2: Hi, how can I help you?  \nMe: I’m here to pick up a prescription, it’s under [first name] [last name].  \nW2: Ok, I’ll go get it for you.  \n\nHe looks for three minutes and comes back to the counter.  \n\nW2: Did you say your name was [last name]?  \nMe: Yes, just like [type of location name is].  \n\nW2 goes back to look for it. He finally finds a bag and brings it over.  \n\nW2: Are you sure your last name is [actual last name]?  \nMe: Yes, it is. I’ll give you my license to show you.  \nW2: No, it’s alright, I believe you. She (W) put it under [wrong last name] which is why I couldn’t find it.  \nMe: (laughs) That’s ok, I understand. I get that all the time.  \n\nI’m annoyed but it’s not W2’s fault at all, so I continue talking to W2 as he’s checking me out for the prescription. I finish the transaction, wish him a good day, and as I’m walking away, I noticed two things on the bag.  \n\nOne was a hand written note next to my wrongly printed name, asking the person that was going to check the prescription off to confirm if my last name really was the one that was given to her on my license, insurance card, and prescription. She also spelled my street name wrong. The only information she didn’t mess up was my birthdate, which was the only thing she didn't have me verbally confirm.  \n\nLet’s just say I won’t be refilling at this particular pharmacy location.",

She starts insinuating that this isn’t the “correct” prescription, as the doctor who prescribed me the medication was different from the one on my insurance card. I told her I see the doctor that gave me the prescription in her hand for the medication, as I see different doctors for different issues. W was visibly annoyed but didn’t fight it. \n\nFinally, the information is filled out, I find out my rate for the prescription, I agreed to it, and left it for them to fill. I returned to pick it up a couple of hours later. I walk up to the pick up counter, where a gentleman was working. I’ll refer to him as W2. W2 is much friendlier than W was.\n\nW2: Hi, how can I help you?\nMe: I’m here to pick up a prescription, it’s under [first name] [last name].\nW2: Ok, I’ll go get it for you.\n\nHe looks for three minutes and comes back to the counter.\n\nW2: Did you say your name was [last name]?\nMe: Yes, just like [type of location name is]. \n\nW2 goes back to look for it and finds it. He gets a bag and brings it over.\n\nW2: (reading the info on the bag) Are you sure your last name is [actual last name]?\nMe: Yes, it is. I’ll give you my license to show you.\nW2: No, it’s alright, I believe you. She (W) put it under [wrong last name] which is why I couldn’t find it.\nMe: (laughs) That’s ok, I understand. I get that all the time.\n\nI’m annoyed but it’s not W2’s fault at all, so I continue talking to W2 as he’s checking me out for the prescription. I finish the transaction, wish him a good day, and as I’m walking away, I noticed two things on the bag.\n\nOne was a hand written note next to my wrongly printed name, asking the person that was going to check the prescription off to confirm if my last name really was the one that was given to her on my license, insurance card, and prescription. She also spelled my street name wrong. The only information she didn’t mess up was my birthdate, which, oddly enough was the only thing she didn't have me verbally confirm.\n\nLet’s just say I won’t be refilling at this particular pharmacy location.",

We settle for a sit-down place that, last time we went, had some pretty good food. I'm a burger guy, so I want a nice burger.\n\nAfter our waitress gets our drinks, we place our orders. I order a Bacon Cheeseburger, with barbecue sauce, with a side of fries. She takes both of our orders, and we catch up.\n\nShe comes back later with the food, and I am starving. I pick at the fries before I dig in. It's delicious.\n\nBut there's something odd about this burger. I can't figure out what it is, but it seems different.\n\nI pull it apart, and find out it's a pulled pork sandwich. Nothing in my order mentioned any of those words.

I guess it could've been worse and got soup or something.\n\nI bring it up to the waitress, and she apologizes and runs back to place the correct order.

A little confused that this minor incident now has the manager apologizing for it, but I guess that speaks to the type of people that they get.\n\nAfter we've finished eating, I convince my parent to leave a full 20% tip (they were treating me), and we leave.

While we were waiting on his manager to balance the register, I told him something along the lines of, \"I was once a cashier so I understood what he had to do.\"\n\n He responded, \"$10 is worth it to wait for.\"\n\nLater on, he said to me, \"are you sure there was nothing else in your wallet? Maybe you thought you had a twenty but actually pulled out a ten\"\n\nOnce they got it sorted out, he gave me $10 and said \"thank you for your patience.\"\n\nI responded \"I would like an apology for you wasting ten minutes of mine,\" while I was walking out.\n\nHe then asked me,\"Would you like your receipt?\n\nI was irritated at this kid so I ignored him and kept walking but he said to himself, but loud enough for me to hear, \"I guess not.\"\n\nAm I petty for wanting a fucking apology for being inconvenienced because the cashier wasn't paying attention to the amount I paid?

If he's my cashier when I check out, is it warranted if I do either one of these things: 1) Pull out cash, look at him, then say \"oh. it's you,\" then proceed to pay with card;\" or, when I've got nowhere to be 2) \"Buy something for under $10, give him a $10, tell him I gave him $20, then make him balance his register.\n\nI've been in this situation where I was the cashier and someone was trying to scam the store I was working at. I've never been in the situation where the customer was right. However, I feel like if I were, I would have felt bad and apologized.

It was a Saturday afternoon and my roommates and I decide to have some friends over to hang out, play some video games and drink beer. Nothing too crazy as it was Parent's Weekend and most people had family activities early the next morning.\n\nThere were maybe 12 of us and, as it got later, we decided to order some food. Usually we'd get takeout from a national pizza chain since we could pay using our university's meal plan, but everyone was sick of it, so we ordered from a nearby privately-owned, non-chain restaurant. It was more expensive, but the food was much better.\n\nI make the call to put in our order. It's a pretty big one, totaling just over $200, and they warn us that, being Parents Weekend, they're very busy and it might be over an hour before the food gets to us. *OK, no problem*, and I give them my debit card information to pay.\n\nThe food arrives around an hour and a half later. All is good, except for my order. I ordered a calzone and they gave me a pizza instead. I would have let is slide, but looking at the receipt, they charged me for a calzone which was more expensive.\n\nI call the restaurant, and from the background noise, I could tell they're still very busy. I explain the problem and ask for an exchange. The girl tells me how swamped they all are and asks me to just settle for the pizza. I stand my ground, and she hangs up on me.\n\nI call back. No answer. Repeat. Still no answer. Finally, on the third try, some guy answers the phone. I explain about the order and that I was hung up on. The guy identifies himself as the manager and says his staff don't have time for the phone. I asked if they could send the calzone or at least reimburse me for that part of the order. He replies with a \"Yeah, not gonna happen. If you want a calzone, fold the pizza in half\" and hangs up.\n\nI was pretty angry. I ordered from that place a lot, so I was really surprised by how I was treated. But whatever, it's only $10's difference... I go back to drinking beer and playing video games, and end up eating some of the pizza.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later, my phone rings. It's the manager who hung up on me. Apparently, they made a mistake when copying down my debit card number and asked if I could give it to them again. I make sure the guy realizes I'm the same person who he hung up on earlier. He's aware, and asks me for my debit card info again.\n\n\"Yeah, not gonna happen.\" and I hang up.",

        "text": "This happened yesterday. I've never seen a more absurd demonstration of customer entitlement in my life, so thought I'd share it. Hopefully this is the right place for it, but if not, my apologies.\n\nJust as a bit of background, in high school, I worked in several customer-service roles (fast food, theater concessions, department store and telephone answering service), so I know how unreasonable people can be, and I try very hard to make sure that, if someone does help me, I'm not a pain and that they know I appreciate their time.\n\nSo, yesterday afternoon, I went to a department store to get some new clothes for a job interview I have next week. As I'm going in, a young man (16-19 y/o, I would say) holds the first set of doors for me. I thank him, then hold the next set of doors for him. He's holding a vest that employees of the store wear, so presumably he's just showing up for his shift and needs to go punch in or whatever. I'll refer to him as E for employee.\n\nThe menswear is on the second floor, so I head to towards the escalator. E is only a few steps in front of me and seems to be headed for the escalators as well. He has earbuds in and is talking, so presumably, he's on the phone.\n\nWe both get on the escalator and I'm maybe 3 steps behind him. We're going up, when I hear \"Oh, *FINALLY*! Excuse me, sir? EXCUSE ME!\" I glance up and there's an irate-looking woman on the going-down side of the escalator trying to get E's attention. He's still on the phone, looking down and off to the side, and doesn't notice her.\n\nAs they pass, the woman actually tries to grab E to get his attention. She doesn't manage to reach him, but does manage to smack me in the face in the process. Of course, no apologies or anything; just a dirty look as if to say *how dare you get in my way*. She keeps trying to get E's attention, to the point where she actually turned and started walking up the down escalator to try to catch up to him. \n\nShe made it up a few steps, basically pushing her way around another customer, before being blocked by a cluster of people. So she's forced to stop, but all the while continues yelling after E, alternating between \"How dare you ignore me!\", \"HELLO! I NEED IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE!\" and the like. Easily one of the most bizarre 30 seconds of my life.\n\nAnyway, when we get to the top, E takes out his earbuds and slips on his vest, just in time to hear the woman bellow a final, \"HELLO!!!?!\". He looked back confused, but at this point, the lady can no longer be seen. We're both still headed in roughly the same direction away from the escalator, so I figure it's worth giving him a heads up:\n\n&gt;ME: There was some crazy lady trying to get your attention on the escalator. You might want to keep your head down for a bit to avoid her.\n\n&gt;E: Seriously? Oh man, I was on the phone. Was she mad?\n\n&gt;ME: Yes, she definitely was. But it was totally ridiculous. I wouldn't worry about it...[I go on to explain her shenanigans as we're walking].\n\nOh course, as I'm reassuring him, we both hear a loud, \"I HAVE NEVER ... BEEN ... SO DISRESPECTED ... IN ALL MY LIFE!\" (through heavy breathing) and turn to see Crazy Lady (CL) storming over to us. E immediately begins to apologize but CL is having none of it. She's been searching for an employee to help her for over 10 minutes and can't believe how disrespectful E was and she would make sure he was fired. I'd heard enough at this point and wanted to punch the lady (she hit me first, after all), but instead:\n\n&gt;ME: Excuse me, ma'am, he's currently assisting me with something. Please find someone else to help you. I don't have time for your interruptions.\n\n&gt;CL (giving me a death stare): No, I need help right now. I've been here longer.\n\n&gt;ME: Then find someone else. Good bye.\n\n&gt;CL: Well, you're both very rude and I'm certainly going to talk to his manager about this.\n\n&gt;ME: I'll be sure to do the same.\n\nShe finally leaves, E goes to the back room to punch in and I buy the clothes I needed. When I'm leaving, I bumped into E again who's doing some recovery in the shoe department. As far as he knew, CL hadn't made a complaint yet, but I told him I'd let his manager know what happened and he gave me the manager's number. I left a message that night about how helpful E was and how disruptive CL was (mentioning the potentially dangerous things she pulled on the escalator). I haven't heard back yet, but I hope E didn't get into any trouble. If I hear anything, I'll be sure to update this post.\n\nI'm still shocked at this woman's behavior. Can someone really lack that much self-awareness? I'm kind of curious what it is she needed help with, but I guess I'll never know.",

I'm sure you're wondering what the title of this tale could mean.\n\nThis tailor shop is a (privately owned, as far as I know?) Tailor store found in a popular Scarborough/Toronto shopping centre. It's a VERY expensive store (seriously, their dress shirts are upwards of $120). I went to this store about 2 weeks before my hight school graduation to purchase a dress shirt, vest, jacket and shoes. My parents provided me with the necessary funds and I headed in. Keep in mind, I'm about 6 feet tall and not exactly young looking.\n\nI manage to flag down an employee that I know quite well (my dad has shopped here before and I talked with this guy often) and I inquired about the items I needed. The skill of this man's mental measurements astounded me, as he got a perfectly fitting vest, shirt and jacket without taking ANY measurements or even estimates. As I'm about ready to pay, a tall woman with a Manager tag walks over and starts reprimanding me. I'll refer to her as RM, or Ridiculous Manager. \n\nRM: Hey, kid! Where are your parents? *speaking in the most derogatory and offensive child's voice possible* \nMe: Oh, my parents aren't here, they're shopping somewhere else. \nRM: How do you plan to pay then? *her face suddenly darkens* Not planning to steal, are you?\n\nAlthough I'm a bit offended, as my dad is a regular customer and they SHOULD know me, I smile anyway.\n\nMe: No no, I am sure I have enough money for this. \nRM: *scoffs and looks at the employee who helped me* what is this? These sizes are far too big for him! \nMe: actually I tried them on already... They fit great! \n\nShe stared at me with the look of a hungry lion sizing up its prey. \n\nRM: Alright... \n\nI pay for the outfit (plus shoes) and hooo boy, was it expensive. I barely was able to pay, but I managed. As I was leaving I met up with my parents and the Manager suddenly storms over. \n\nRM: Mr and Mrs. (Last name)!!! Your son tried to steal from us!! \n\nAll of my wat.\n\nDad: What?! That's absurd! \nRM: He hasn't paid for those clothes, I'm sure!\n\nLong story short, I nearly got arrested as she called security, they checked my receipt, said to the Manager to stop being ridiculous, and we went home in triumph. \n\nStill, though... Was it because I'm young or because I look strong? \n\nTL:DR, go to buy expensive clothes, manager lies and says I didn't pay, tries to get me arrested ",

(Getting an idea) You know, maybe you could get a binder and put the discs in it to keep behind the register, then when they want a DVD they can ask for it...\n\nCashier: (Suddenly glowers at me)  You seriously want to make me do ALL that EXTRA work?  No, absolutely not!  There is NO POINT!  Making me try to do EXTRA work for your DVDs...\n\nShe seriously began yelling at me over it.  I was so shocked I just squeaked out a \"thank you\" and scurried away quick as I could.  \n\nI wasn't trying to be mean, was just thinking aloud, I even recall having a cheery voice because I wanted to help the thrift store (it was one of my favorites).  \n\nI didn't even buy a DVD.

        "text": "Sorry for the rant. I'm really, really fed up right now. \n\nAbout a year ago, my boyfriend and I were so excited to start using this service that would send you ingredients and recipes for 3 full dinners every week. It sounded like it would take a lot of the stress out of cooking semi-complex dinners.\n\nOur first delivery was guaranteed to arrive by 8:00. We eat dinner pretty late, so we decided that we could wait until 8:00 if need be and cook our first meal the night of the delivery. We had dinner plans the following night, too, and we wanted to cook the fish ASAP. Well, 8:00 rolled around, and there was no delivery. Then 9:00. Then 10:00. Finally our food arrived. I wrote an angry email about how this was making a terrible first impression, and they replied by giving us a $5.00 credit and promising it wouldn't happen again. Okay. The meals were good, so we tried again.\n\nSecond week's delivery arrived on time - yes! We unloaded the ingredients quickly and started cooking. We saved the tastiest-sounding meal for last  - steak tacos with tomatillo sauce. And that was when we started looking for the tomatillo. No tomatillo. The one obscure (for our neighborhood, at least) ingredient in the box was not there. And the sauce utilized maybe 5 of the other ingredients, too, which otherwise were going to go unused. We went out searching for a tomatillo at 8:00 at night - for at least an hour - with no luck. We ultimately bought a jar of pre-made tomatillo sauce. Another email was sent, asking for a refund for that meal, as we wasted money, ingredients, and time. They refused a refund but instead applied a credit to our next delivery. Annoying, but we understood the tactic, and the meals had tasted great. We took the credit and let the next delivery be our last set of meals from them. It actually went smoothly, but we were just tired of bracing ourselves for the next mistake.\n\nFast forward to present day. We've been really bad about grocery shopping, so we decided to give it another go, figuring that they'd had time to work out the kinks. We selected the Thursday delivery this time, again by 8:00. We later realized that this was not ideal for this particular week, as we agreed to dog sit all the way across town all weekend, planning to head over there immediately after work on Friday (today). However, the food is supposed to stay fresh all week (with the exception of the fish), so we planned to make the fish on Thursday and cook the other 2 meals on Monday and Tuesday. Problem solved. \n\nExcept last night, at 6:40 (40 minutes after their business hours end), I received an email saying that our delivery was postponed, but - \"not to worry!\" - they'd  already arranged for it to be delivered tomorrow (Friday). I immediately replied saying that that would not work as we would not be home to move the food into the refrigerator. I explained the situation and asked for an immediate cancellation of the order, plus a full refund. I also left a voicemail. Aaaaand I have yet to hear from them. It's now 9:15 Friday morning, and I currently have no idea if I will come home to a box of rotting meat on Monday night. \n\nNeedless to say, we're done with this service. I have to read the terms of service, but I'm not sure what I'm going to do if there's a delivery waiting for us. What a waste. \n\nEdit: tldr: Meal delivery service messes up too many times. Missing ingredient, delayed deliveries, and lack of communication. Potential rotting meat on my doorstep. Not happy. The end.\n\nUPDATE: Been calling since 10:00 this morning (their hours are 10-6). Finally spoke to someone at 11:00 - she said our order was refunded last night, but her colleague had neglected to email me. They were unable to stop the delivery, so we will have a lovely, stinky surprise waiting for us when we get home. ",

I know the girl who served me and she assured me it was totally fine but I know the feeling and I felt dreadful. She asks if I want my usual, I say yes and pay, then wait on a nearby bench. About two minutes later, in walks a large guy with his friend, a small dude in a blazer and khakis. The large guy orders and gets his pizza immediately. It's that little \"Hot N Ready\" shop that has pepperonis always hot and ready, however, they now close in 10 minutes and are cleaning out everything. The small guy tries to order the same thing.\n\n&gt;Cashier: Sorry, since we're closing we stopped making them about 5 minutes ago, but we can get one made if you want to wait 7 minutes. \n\n&gt;Blazer Guy: That's false advertising, the sign right there says Hot N Ready and it's not hot or ready. \n\n&gt;Cashier: Sorry, would you like the pepperoni pizza still, sir?\n\n&gt;Blazer Guy: Naw, give me one of the deep dishes. \n\n&gt;Cashier: Alright, that'll be $X. \n\n&gt;Blazer Guy: Are they hot and ready?\n\n&gt;Cashier: No sir, nothing is ready right now, but we can get anything you want made. \n\n&gt;Blazer Guy: You really need to change your sign then. I should sue you guys for that.\n\nThe lady takes his order and goes to the back to start making it. I'm now left alone in the lobby with this guy and this asshole in the blazer. He's pacing around. Then he walks up to the fridge and pulls out a Mountain Dew. \n\n&gt;Blazer Guy (to friend): Did this come with my meal?\n\n&gt;Friend: I don't think so, man. \n\n&gt;Blazer Guy: I paid $12 for it, I should at least get a drink. Should I just steal it? I should just take it. \n\n&gt;Chill Friend: (laughs) No, man, don't. \n\nThen another customer comes in and orders a pepperoni, completely understanding in the fact it has to be made and isn't hot n ready. The cashier turns to the kitchen and says \n\n&gt;Cashier: One pep!\n\n&gt;Blazer Guy: Hahahaha, one pep! ONE PEP, ONE PEP. Am I fucking up the kitchen right now? One pep! \n\nHe just kept going on and on saying stupid shit. Whenever I got my pizza I leaned in and told the cashier that he took out a pop and to watch him. I don't know how someone can act like that and not be completely embarrassed of themselves.",

I was appalled at the laziness, incompetence and aversion I encountered.\n\nMy business has been receiving mail for an unknown person for weeks. It has our address but belongs to a completely random, unaffiliated person. If you get one piece it's not really an issue but the mail began to pile up and some of it looked important so I notified my mail carrier. I told him I did not know this person and to stop delivering it and maybe figure out what to do with it. I mean I don't really know if they can find out where it is supposed to go but, bottom line, stop giving it to me. \n\nAt first the mail stopped coming. Then I would get bunches of it at once. I noticed that I was getting this random mail on the days that I was not present when the mail carrier came by. **He was saving it for the days that I wasn't in the office and delivering it then.** \n\nI decide to go directly to the source to stop this nonsense and, you know, maybe make sure this woman is gets her bills and magazines and shit. Yesterdat, I took my (her) stack of mail to the local post office and described for them my (very simple) problem. I ask them what they can do because, you know, they are the ones that deliver the mail. That's not my job. The woman at the desk has a puzzled look and says, \"Well, this is your address, isn't it?\" \n\n\"Well yes it is,\" I tell her, \"but the mail is not mine nor does it belong to anyone at this address.\"\n\n\"Okay well I'll tell the route carrier.\" \n\nSo what happens today? **I got every single piece of mail that i gave them yesterday ALONG WITH A COUPLE NEW ONES**. They didn't just NOT do what I asked them. That would be one thing. If I got another piece for this mystery woman, that would *still* be some pretty epic failure to perform but NO. Not only did they bring more after I twice asked them to stop, they brought all the other shit back. They had ONE JOB and did the complete and perfect OPPOSITE of what I asked. \n\nBeing a blue-blooded liberal, I've defended the *SPS a few times to conservatives who would rather see the money allocated elsewhere. Nope. No more. Cut those halfwits loose and let the free market do its thing. \n\nTL;DR: Returned mail that doesn't belong to me to the post office and they delivered it all again.  ",

        "text": "My brother and I were shooting the shit the other day reminiscing about when we lived in Washington, DC and he reminded me of a story I thought I'd share with you all.\n\nWe were in a particular Seattle-based coffee shop located in a semi-touristy part of the city. It was fairly quiet, just us and maybe one or two other people. The staff was fairly busy, though, because the franchise owner was in and he seemed like maybe he wasn't built for managing a staff. Very demanding and grumpy and loud in his criticisms of how much his employees were disappointing him. At one point an obviously homeless guy came in to get a cup of water and the owner chased him out because, he said, those kinds of people are always messing up the place and asking people for money and making the cafe unpleasant. I can't imagine that homeless guy was going to make it any more unpleasant than owner was making it, though.\n\nAnyway, towards the end of our visit I decided that I needed a quick slash. I had to wait a few minutes because one of the baristas was sent to clean the bathrooms. No biggie, right? Who doesn't appreciate peeing in a clean loo? He finishes up and comes out and before I can get up, owner runs in to do his own business. Again, no biggie. He's only in there a few minutes. \n\nWhen he comes out I jump up and go in. And what do I find? Piss. Everywhere. On the toilet seat, on the floor, even a little bit on the wall. Remember, the barista had just cleaned it up, which means that it had to have been the owner who managed to get it everywhere but in the bowl where it belonged.  \n\nSimply horrible. I would much rather have preferred homeless guy asking me for some change than the expert job the owner did of marking his territory.",

Up came about half a dozen large shrimp! Tossed again, same result. Virtually every throw brings up shrimp! We can’t stop, this is GREAT! Much later we realize it’s 1 am, we have pounds and pounds of delicious shrimp, so fresh they are kicking… but no ice to hold them till morning. I need to go buy ice.\n\nIn \"town\" (pop 2000) is an automated ice dispensary where you stick in money and a bag of ice drops out. I’m dressed for cast-netting; a swimsuit, t-shirt, sandals. After netting for hours the shirt is too fishy for the car, so I take off the shirt, sit on a towel and drive to the icehouse. No one will see me at 1:30 am in Nowhere at the off-road icehouse, or care if they do.\n\nIcehouse money-taker-machine is broken. No ice from there.\n\nThe all-night gas station / convenience store on the highway through town is open… and they sell ice! As I walk to the door I see the sign “no shirt, no shoes…” but, I HAVE to have ice!\n\nI step inside. The counter is manned by two ladies. \n\n“I’m sorry I’m not properly dressed, but something has come up, and I have an unexpected, sudden and desperate need for a couple of bags of ice. Can I please buy ice dressed like this, or must I go get a shirt and come back?” (Smile… thinking please please please - just sell me the ice!)\n\nThey look me over and evidently decide that it’s BORING working the wee hours in a town where no one is out at night. Play me for a little bit first.\n\n“Hun, *you* can come in anytime like that! That sign is just for the nasty 'ol oystermen. Come on in, stay a while! What in the world do you need ice for at this time of night anyway?” Etc., etc. Eventually they took my money and I got my ice.\n\n \n\nOne would think that was embarrassing, but that’s just because you don’t yet have the Ultimate Embarrassment Benchmark, which follows.\n\n \n\nA couple of days later (Saturday morning) Wife and I are driving out of town. We stop in the same store to get coffee and a couple of chicken biscuits. The place is packed, bustling, loud, and all they have left for breakfast is hot wings and corn dogs. I get coffee and get in the long line. At the counter is one of the ladies from a couple of nights ago. Harried voice: “Did-you find-everything-you-were-looking-for?”\n\n“Well, I was hoping for two chicken biscuits, but I see you’ve had a really busy morning. Just the coffee will do, thanks.”\n\nSudden interest. “Hey... I don’t recognize you, but I know your voice from somewhere?”\n\n“Ice at 1:30 in the morning.”\n\nFace lights up, shouts to back room “HEY! IT’S OUR HOT, WET GUY... ‘CEPT NOW HE’S WEARING *CLOTHES*! AND HE NEEDS A COUPLE OF CHICKEN BISCUITS!”\n\nPlace falls dead silent, and I can feel every single set of eyes locking on me, speculatively.\n\nFrom the back “OH, LORDY! WE”RE ALL OUT! BUT, TELL HIM TO HANG ON! I’LL PUT TOGETHER SOMETHIN, SOMEHOW!”\n\nAfter an amazingly short (but eternally long) one minute, in which not a single soul in the store said a word or moved a muscle, the other lady comes out with two hot chicken biscuits. I smile, thank them both, pay and leave. At the door I glance back. Every soul is still rooted in place, watching me leave. Even the next person in line has not stepped forward yet. \n\n \n\nAnd that is why we have to move out of state.",

I saw her hand back some change to the cashier and tell her that she just owed her a nickel. I didn't think too much about it.\n\nMy husband, daughter, and I placed our order. I wasn't paying too much attention when my husband paid for our order until I noticed he had to give the cashier back some change and and tell her to give him the right amount. At that point I started to really watch her because I wanted to make sure my daughter's friends got back the correct amount of change because as kids they probably wouldn't even notice if she gave them back the wrong amount. \n\nThe first kid placed their order and was supposed to get back $16.72. I was watching the cashier closely. She had no trouble counting out the bills, but when it came to the change she started struggling........like really struggling. She was using her fingers to count, and then started looking really frustrated etc until I finally spoke up and said 2 quarters, 2 dimes, and 2 pennies. She looked at me in relief and said, thank you! \n\nI continued to watch her when the next kid ordered. The total he was supposed to receive back was $14.63. Again, she had no trouble getting the bills out correctly but she started struggling hard with the change. So, again, I spoke up and told her 2 quarters, 1 dime, and 3 pennies. Again, she said thank you! \n\nThe person that looked like the manager looked over both times she heard me tell the cashier what change to hand out. She ended up getting the cashier to start putting the orders together and she started working the register. I wouldn't be surprised if that drawer isn't WAY off balance when it's counted tonight. I understand that some people are not great with math and money but this was way past that. How does a person get to be old enough to work a job but can't count out change properly, especially when the register told her exactly how much to give back!?!?!",

It just happened to be the cigarette isle.  As I reach the checkout the lady in front of me is just finishing unloading her cart on the belt.   She noticed that I only have two bottles of water and offers to let me go ahead of her.   However, the cashier had already started scanning her items so I thanked her and politely declined.   \n\nAfter the cashier finished ringing up her purchases the lady requested a pack of cigarettes.   The cashier ran them up and requested ID.   She took out her ID and handed it to the cashier.   No big deal happens all day.   Here is where it becomes jaw droppingly stupid.   After she hands him her ID the cashier turns to me and asks for my ID.   \n\nWe both reply that we are not together.   The cashier then replied \"I saw you two talking I know you are together! \"  What?  The lady then says \"Strangers talk to each other too!\"  Meanwhile I am standing dumbfounded while these two are staring at each other and I am getting ready to ring the boxing bell.  At that moment the cashier calls out for a manager. \n\nI reiterate that I am not with the woman and I don't have any ID because I had left my purse in the car because I was simply grabbing a bottle of water.   I then offered to get my purse if that was the only way to get the line moving.  The lady replies that it isn't necessary that I should not have to provide identification for a perfect stranger and she will just get her cigarettes elsewhere. \n\nProblem solved right?   Oh come on that just too easy.  No the cashier has summoned the manager which locks the register and now we must wait for the manager.   Good night.   So the manager finally meanders over and we explain the situation.   He just shakes his head and finishes out the transaction.   The lady takes her things and says good bye to me and leaves.  I purchase my water and leave out the opposite door.  \n\n\nTl;DR Stranger danger still applies to adults.",
