        "text": "Browsing Gametales recently, I encountered [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/39cj3b/acslb_the_death_of_an_actual_cannibal/) about a microRPG based on a terrifying encounter with Actual Cannibal Shia Labeouf. After finding [the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ACSLB) dedicated to its development and downloading [the rules PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B969888pWakxOHMxRjlUOVpHdW8/view), I invited the Glorious Chucklefucks to try it out. Donovan and Spencer couldn't make it, leaving Garrett, Wade, and JD to face the terror of...Shia Labeouf. \n\nGarrett went with a fairly straightforward Irish rock climber, armed with a military multi-tool. A somewhat scattered collection of features, but plausible. He was unacquainted with his two companions, whose players took...a somewhat less serious approach. JD created a 75 year-old Jewish Neo-Nazi armed with a swastika throwing-star, while Wade chose a middle-aged Israeli Muslim Extremist with a length of piano wire.\n\nAboard a train in the depths of a dark, abandoned subway station, the unlikely trio slowly awakens. None of them knows where they are, or how they got there, but they can hear the menacing sounds of shuffling footsteps in the darkness. The Neo-Nazi and Muslim Extremist immediately begin praying to Der Fuhrer and shouting Allahu Akbar, respectively, prompting the baffled and somewhat frightened Irishman to back up against one of the windows. This proves to be an unwise decision, when moments later that window shatters inward, propelled by a bloody, naked human figure which latches itself onto the Irishman's back. \n\nIT'S SHIA LABEOUF!\n\nShia takes a bite out of the Irishman's neck, blood spraying everywhere, but fortunately the rock climber can do jujitsu, and attempts to flip Shia onto the broken glass he has strewn across the floor. He succeeds, slicing a deep gash across Shia's face, but overbalances himself in doing so and lands on the glass himself, cutting his arm. The cannibal shrieks in outrage and leaps out the window, giving the victims a temporary respite. After bandaging the Irishman's wounds, the group moves out onto the platform, dimly lit by a flickering electric light, and starts moving in a direction which they hope is that in which the exit lies. The Irishman requests that the Nazi stop loudly praying to Der Fuhrer, as it is giving away their position; the Nazi is not receptive. \n\nThen, as they pass under another flickering light, they catch a glimpse of a figure seated in the train; another survivor, or the corpse of one of Shia's victims? They look closer, and the figure raises its head to look back. IT'S SHIA LABEOUF! He leaps through the window and lunges for the Nazi, who barely manages to dodge out of the way. Shia lands in a crouch on the platform, then lunges for the Irishman, who is not so lucky; Shia rakes across the poor rock climber's side with his vicious claws. The Nazi hurls his swastika throwing star at Shia Labeouf, but grips it in such a way that he slices open his own palm in the process. The projectile buries itself in Shia's side, and he darts away into the darkness. The Irishman is badly wounded now, but the group has finally caught sight of a set of stairs, hopefully leading out of the station. \n\nThey climb up and enter a long hallway with two doors on the left and one on the right before curving to the left a ways ahead. Ignoring the doors, the crew races toward the end of the hall, hoping to find an exit. As they pass the second door on the left, however, it suddenly bursts off its hinges and flattens the Nazi against the wall! Standing in the doorway, Shia Labeouf! He surges forward and manages to wound the Irishman yet again, but this time his victim strikes back with the knife attachment on his multitool, dealing Shia a deep wound in the neck. The cannibal leaps up, into a ventilation shaft in the ceiling, and is once again temporarily gone.\n\nExploring the storage closet Shia burst out of, the survivors find several useful items: a flashlight, a wrench to replace the Nazi's lost weapon (still buried in Shia's flank), a lighter, several cans of highly flammable WD40, and several brooms, which the Irishman carves into spears with his knife. The group then hears a noise in the back of the closet, alerting them that Shia is in there with them. Brandishing their spears, they prepare to face the cannibal, but are taken aback when the sound of his footsteps abruptly vanishes. The quick-thinking Muslim Extremist warns the others to watch the ceiling, and they look up just in time to see Shia Labeouf leaping down at them. The intrepid survivors point the sharp ends of their spears directly up, impaling Shia as he descends. But Shia Labeouf is undeterred, and intentionally drags himself further down onto the Irishman's spear to get close enough for another attack! The Irishman falls, bleeding profusely, and Shia leaps away, breaking off the spears in his chest before bounding away. The Irishman, knowing that he is near death, bravely volunteers to stay behind rather than slow the other two down. His fellow survivors have another idea.\n\nThe Nazi and the Muslim burst into the hallway and rush forward, hauling the Irishman in front of them as a human shield. The wounded man still holds the flashlight, illuminating the way forward with a shaky, wobbling circle of light. They round the corner and see, far ahead of them at the end of the hallway, the red light of an exit sign! They move toward the exit as fast as they can, but after a few moments the Irishman discovers that HIS LEG, AH! IT'S CAUGHT IN A BEAR TRAP! Shia has tampered with the trap, removing the latch to open it, and the Irishman knows that this is the end. He takes the WD40 and the lighter, then bids his companions to run for their lives. They do so, leaving the Irishman in the dark trying to free his leg.\n\nWith the help of the WD40, the Irish rock climber manages to wriggle his leg free from the trap, only to look up and see a shadowy figure standing over him. It's Shia Labeouf. Knowing that his life is about to end, the Irishman does the only thing he can; he douses himself thoroughly in the highly flammable WD40 and uses the lighter to set himself ablaze. As his final act, he attempts to embrace Shia Labeouf, but the cannibal jumps back out of his reach, leaving the poor Irishman to burn to death in the darkness. His only consolation lies in knowing that he will leave nothing for Shia Labeouf to devour.\n\nHearing the screams behind them, the implausible brothers sprint for their lives toward the exit door, armed with the last of their spears and the wrench they'd picked up. They look back to see Shia Labeouf following them, about thirty feet back. He gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint, gaining on them! With moments to spare, they reach the door and kick it down, running through to find themselves in the lobby of the station, with the door to the outside ahead of them. The brothers sprint to it, only to find a padlocked chain sealing their only path to freedom. They find their salvation in the form of a pair of bolt cutters, located in a nearby storage closet, and narrowly avoid another encounter with Shia Labeouf in the process of retrieving them. They manage to trap Shia inside the closet and escape, cutting the chain and emerging into the outside. But they are in the Ghetto in the middle of the night, and won't be safe until they can make it to a hospital to treat their wounds.\n\nChoosing a random car parked on the street, they break in and find a revolver in the glove compartment with two bullets in the chamber. As the Muslim begins hotwiring the vehicle, the Nazi looks over his shoulder and sees a shadow in the back seat...\n\n**SHIA SURPRISE!**\n\nShia Labeouf lunges forward and rakes his claws across the Muslim's chest and throat, spraying blood across the car. The Nazi stabs with his broom-spear, and the Muslim points the revolver over his shoulder and pulls the trigger. The sharpened point of the spear pierces Shia's cannibal heart, and the bullet reduces his evil, inhuman brain to a cloud of red mist. All of the evil energies within the actual cannibal's cursed body burst out and dissipate into the air, leaving only a bloody husk behind. The two brothers sit, panting and bleeding, in the aftermath of Shia's demise. Their wounds, both mental and physical, will leave them scarred for the rest of their days, but they are safe.\n\nThey've won.\n\nThey're finally safe from Shia Labeouf.",

        "text": "(Note this is using the Victoria 2 Ultimate Mod)\n\n1939. Benito Mussolini leads his people into the 2nd World War. A maelstrom of death as French, Belgian, Dutch, and British forces assault northeastern Italy, while a mostly French force spearheads a counterattack from the German blitzkrieg. Much of Northern Italy is taken by the Allied forces, but not for long as the Germans have broken through the Maginot line and steamrolled into the Northern France. A coalition of German and Italian forces retake Norther Italy from the Allies, as Italy moves in for a swift and decisive capture of Greece. As France falls to the German war machine, Italy turns her sights on the Kingdom of the Serbs and Slavs (think roughly Yugoslavia). Again, the Italian forces, now toughened veterans quickly destroy all resistance and take Eastern Balkans. The Germans then smash the Dutch, and capture Amsterdam and Belgium as well. The United Kingdom, now barely receiving even the basic necessities as a joint German and Italian blockade stop any US supplies and reinforcements to even reach English soil, accept a surrender agreement from the Germans, abolish their government and install a Fascist Regime, loyal to Hitler himself.  \n\nNow Hitler comes to Mussolini and asks him for his support in a war against the massive Soviet Union, a foolish war that Mussolini’s knows the exhausted Germans will lose, even with Italian support. Hitler, furious, returns to Berlin and immediately launches his invasion. At first it looked to be decisively German, but the Soviet forces just never stopped coming, even with Japanese support in Siberia (The Japanese were about 50% of the way with the annexation of China, their main goal). The real turning point was a massive American invasion force that slipped past German U-Boats. Suddenly Germany was facing a 2 fronted war, and it began losing and rapidly. And just like that, it was over. Hitler had committed suicide as Patton himself laid the charges to blow open Hitler’s bunker. As Mussolini watched, the US and Soviets agreed to rather strange conditional terms. The Reich was dismantled. Germany would be a democracy, and in a more strange turn of events, allowed to keep its ill-gotten colonial gains in the South Pacific, formerly the Dutch Indies. France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, and the Eastern Balkans were returned to their cultural owners, though strangely the Germans were allowed to continue to directly control Serbia, in a move which severely angered Mussolini. The Soviets gained any and all African colonial assets, but overall Germany still managed to come out relatively on top, even if they had to pay war reparations, their country and economy was still very intact. An interesting note is that Prussia was liberated as its own country in-between Poland and Germany.\n\nIt was at this point that Mussolini unveiled his grand plan, the reformation of the Roman Empire. Overnight the flags of the country changed to a blood red flag of the Roman Empire. Europe, nervously looked on, surely not wanting a return to times when Rome ruled the Mediterranean, and most of Europe. The countries of Northern Africa were Rome’s first target. Without any major resistance Roman forces swept through and installed puppet heads in all the states along Mediterranean in Northern Africa, leaving Spain and France a rather worried. It was at this time the English and the French once again drew blood and went to war with each other, this time over a silly diplomatic mistake. France, still very weary from the 2nd World War was utterly crushed, lost whatever colonial possessions they had left and were completely forced to disarm. It was a massive loss of prestige to the French people as they slipped out of Great Power status in the world. Mussolini, being the genius behind the restoration of the Roman Empire, quickly unveiled Top Secret War plans to his top brass, the invasion, and subsequent annexation of France itself, and the subsequent annexations of Belgium and the Netherlands, before anyone could react. Copying German strategies, Roman forces raced across the French countryside, and were in Paris within a week. Within 2 more weeks’ time, the rest of France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxemburg had also fallen. Just like that, within a months’ time, Rome had doubled her living space. In a rather gruesome, and relatively untalked about note, Mussolini ordered a brutal shakedown of any and all dissidents, and committed genocide worse than Hitler’s. The French people rose up, throughout the countryside and launched two massive revolts against Roman occupation. Unfortunately for the French people, the battle hardened troops of the Legion brutally massacred over 1.7 million Frenchmen. \n\nThe British, appalled by the actions of Rome, immediately declared war on the Romans in an attempt to contain and dismantle the Empire. Fortunately, Mussolini had foreseen this backstab from the British and had stationed over 100,000 Roman forces, included the vaunted 1st Legion at Dunkirk as it was the only viable landing zone without American or Soviet support. Mussolini ordered a surprise invasion of the British Isles. However the grand Roman fleet was busy protecting assets in the South Pacific and while steaming at full speed, was not expected to reach the Straights of Dover for another 2 weeks. Mussolini orders a small contingent of troops to board a small fleet, far too small defeat the British Navy to attempt an invasion of Scotland. A suicide mission, but enough to pull the British warships away from the Straights of Dover long enough for 200,000 Roman troops to land in the beaches of Canterbury. Strangely enough, the shores were completely undefended. As the Roman fleet sailed into the Straights of Dover and promptly sank the British fleet, Roman forces started to move outward from Canterbury. Suddenly and swiftly over 500,000 British troops, believed to be mostly conscripts attacked from all sides. In a desperate retreat to Canterbury, Rome lost over 50,000 men, but still retained a beachhead on the British Isle. Continuing on the viscous counterattack, the British poured in over 840,000 able bodied men into the fields of Canterbury. Mussolini realizing that this would be not only the defining battle of the war, but would ultimately make or break either nation, sent in 830,000 of his most battle hardened, troops and not a single conscript. This one battle included nearly every single troop that Rome could muster at the time. This and the fortifications that the Romans were able to construct in Canterbury were the reasons for the utter and total Roman victory. Rome lost roughly 300,000 men, but the English lost over 700,000 men (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=450231024), and eventually the War itself. Rome took all of the Britain’s colonies, forced her to pay reparations to the Roman families affected by the Battle of Canterbury, and completely disarmed her military, while replacing her leader with a far more Roman friendly one. This was the sunset for the once great British Empire. \n\nRome enjoyed the next few years of peace and prosperity, recovering from one of the largest battles in human history, though Mussolini was busy, drawing up plans for the reclamation of the rest of Rome’s former holdings. As the troops moved into place, Romania, Austria, and the rest of the countries in that area all fell to the Roman war machine. The USSR, noting that it was losing far too many of its spherelings, launched their own war of contain and dismantlement against mighty Rome. Unlike the British, the Soviets never through everything they had in one decisive battle, but they were still crushed under the Roman boot. Rome dismantled the Soviet Union, and freed many of the countries that were horribly oppressed by the Russians, and used them as friendly to Rome buffer states.\n\nMeanwhile in his Grand Bunker, Mussolini continued to prepare to the taking of land he rightfully decided belonged to Rome. Bulgaria and Romania both fell to the Roman onslaught within days, being annexed into the Greater Roman Empire. His only targets that remained were the former Soviet states, Spain, Portugal, Germany and Prussia. Soon after the fall of Romania, Rome’s ally Ukraine asked for support against their enemies the Polish in regaining some of their long lost clay. Rome and the Ukrainians quickly destroyed the Polish Armed Forces and split up the bounty, Ukraine regained a state they thought belonged to them, and Rome took the rest of the country. \n\nRome then turned her eyes on the Iberian Peninsula. A naval invasion was planned, as well as a land invasion from Rome’s puppet the Moroccans. Quickly the troops landed and broke the Portuguese resistance and quickly captured the Capital of Lisbon. Portugal not wanting to go down that easily had troops hidden throughout its African holdings and soon struck back at the Romans puppets in Africa. Months of combat between Roman Allies and Portuguese forces were waged until Roman reinforcements arrived to smash the Portuguese resistance, and with that the Portuguese government accepted the Roman war demands of annexation and joined the Greater Roman Empire. Spain however was a far stronger foe and would take months of prepping and moving soldiers to the Spanish borders. Rome declared war, and it raged for years as Spanish forces had been digging in and preparing for the invasion. 10 long years of on and off combat finally saw the Spanish fall, leaving mainland Europe in the hands of Rome and Germany, as well as the former Soviet States. \nWith the defeat of Spain, all forces were moved to the German border. Over 2 million troops surrounded the country with the Roman Fleet in port in the city of Amsterdam.  However a diplomatic incident in Canada, with its westernmost state wanted independence. Imperial Japan, seeing an opportunity backed the separatists in Canada, and the US immediately backed Canada. Rome, attempting to keep its powerful ally in the Pacific backed Japan. In a surprise move the Germans also backed Canada. Diplomatic solutions failed and the world erupted into World War III. Roman forces swept into Germany and broke the German lines almost instantly. Japan and the US never really launched at serious attacks on each other’s mainland, only harassing skirmishes from naval forces. Mussolini however had been working on a secret weapon for years, one painstakingly stolen from German and American scientists; The Atomic Bomb. Suddenly and without warning, Mussolini and Rome launch two tactical nuclear strikes launched from the military garrison of Bermuda on the population centers of both Canada and the US. New York City and Toronto are leveled and the surrounding areas for hundreds of miles are covered in radiation. Japan, completely unaware of the Roman plans was completely shocked and disgusted with the strikes on the civilian populations, immediately sued for peace and declared war on the Roman Empire.\n\nJapanese forces quickly captured Roman holdings in the South Pacific, while the Roman fleet sailed towards Edo. The garrison of Roman Hong Kong remained untouched though it was clear that the Japanese were surrounding the small province with hundreds of thousands of troops. Before reinforcements could arrive the Japanese launched their assault. Outnumbered the Roman forces valiantly defended Hong Kong from the Japanese invaders until reinforcements arrived. The tide was turned and Rome used Hong Kong as a launching point to launch the invasion of mainland China. Over the next year, Japanese China was completely captured by Roman forces, but any attempt on the Japanese main Islands was completely rebuffed. Mussolini and the Roman High Command decided to launch another tactical nuclear strike on Edo. With the threat of more nuclear strikes to come, the Japanese government surrendered to Rome. Japan was to dismantle her overseas empire and disarm its military. In a strange turn of events Rome neglected to oversee the dismantling process and only awarded small chunks of land on the Chinese mainland, with the US and Germany gaining large swathes of land, and Japan allowed to keep large chunks of Chinese territory. It was a strange ending, but Rome had no real interest in lands in the Pacific and let it be.\n\nGermany, allied with some of the remaining Soviet States declared it would defend their sovereignty from any invaders. Rome, seeing an opportunity, promptly declared war on these countries, causing Germany to defend them. Rome swiftly crushed any opposition and while adding these territories to the Greater Roman Empire, completely disarmed Germany. Prussia, seeing an opportunity, promptly declared war on Germany and took roughly half its territory. Rome, sensing opportunity secretly moved a massive number of troops to the Prussia border and struck before more of the Prussian Army could return. Prussia quickly fell to the Roman onslaught and joined the Empire. Germany was surrounded, without an army, and now missing half of what it believed to its rightful territory. They soon fell from Great Power status and with the Romans surrounding the territory the German people voted to cede control of the state to Rome itself. Germany had fallen with not a single more bullet fired. \n\nMussolini then declared that the Greater Roman Empire was to be declared the great nation of Europa. (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=462084092). Mussolini now the Grand Leader of Europe, in a completely surprise move, stepped down and installed a democracy. The people of Europa streamed to the ballot stations and elected Mussolini the first President of Europa, championed by the liberal party. Mussolini and his first Congress declared that all territories of Europe to be rightful members of Europa and immediately invaded Eastern Europe sans Ukraine. Meanwhile troops quickly moved into Denmark and added it to Europa. On the fields of Dunkirk 750,000 Roman troops lay in wait for the invasion of the English Isles. With the Fleet in position the Roman Army quickly crushed the British in London and took the rest of the country with minimal combat. England then joined Europa. Europa then turned to the government of Turkey and demanded the return of Thrace, rightful Europa clay. The Turkish government refused and European forces were sent in to smash the Turks who quickly conceded and surrendered Thrace to Europa. Ireland, the last Great Power in Europe not in the grand Europa Union was quickly invaded by the forces still in Britain and the Emerald Isles were subdued and added to the Grand Union. This only left Ukraine, who decided to join Europa instead of fight. Europa was whole. (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=462084530)\n",

        "text": "Some years ago I was running a game of Hackmaster at my local gameshop. We tended to stick with the flavour as written, so no fudging of dice rolls, full use of crit tables and so on all game into play.\n\nAfter spending two hours carefully guiding the players through character generation, getting everyone set up just how they wanted, we were ready to start play. Total party size of five, but really only the human buccaneer, paladin and the dwarven barbarian are important to this story.\n\nThe game starts, as is traditional, in a tavern - the players know each other but not well, all having answered an advert looking for adventurers. Some introductions and chatter go around and a little bit of boasting begins. At this point I've done nothing more than set the scene and am giving the players time to feel out their characters and get to know one another.\n\nAnd it's then, not five minutes into the game, that the dwarf barbarian fatefully boasts that he has an incredibly hard head. So the buccaneer, laughing all the while, grabs a bottle from the table and states that he's going to smash it over the dwarf's head. The dwarf laughs, the barbarian laughs, everyone's happy. I tell the buccaneer to roll for an attack.\n\n20. A nice, even critical. I start flicking through the book and get to the critical table, and ask the buccaneer to roll his d10 000 for results of the crit. The laughter at this point has stopped. The buccaneer rolls and ends up caving in the dwarf's head completely with this bottle, shattering his helmet, and resulting in instant death. First character death five minutes in.\n\nNow unfortunately the paladin is very heavy on justice and law, and has just seen a murder committed in a public place right in front of him. His system of law was written out by the player pre-game, and murders have only one penalty. So the paladin calls for guards (it's a tiny village, there are no guards) and then resorts to trying to drum up a lynch mob. With a critical on his charisma roll the paladin gets the entire tavern up and moving towards the buccaneer, who fights back in a panic and kills a villager as well. At this point I've given up on trying to get things back on track, and decided I'll just let the survivors deal with the adventure while the casualties roll up new characters.\n\nThe paladin and lynch mob subdue the buccaneer, take him outside, and string him up. Ten minutes into our first session, with no plot having been thrown at the players at all, and we have two character deaths already. It could have been one if not for that paladin...\n\n...who dies a few hours later when a goblin scores a critical hit against him after they've finally started the adventure.",

We used Call of Cthulhu 6th ed rules, but failed san checks indicated a flight or fight response rather than going crazy.\n\nHere is a timeline and a list of characters and how they died, in order of death.\n\nLex Murphy - grandaughter of Dr. Hammond: died when the T-Rex kicked the car she was in over the concrete embankment next to the paddock.\n\nTim Murphy - grandson of Dr. Hammond: ran away towards the Visitor Center when the T-Rex attacked, is blinded by a Dilophosaurus and partially eaten before discovery.\n\nEd Regis - career tourguide: runs away when T-Rex attacks, hides in jungle, attempts to make way back to Visitor Center and is eaten by juvenile T-Rex.\n\nDonald Gennaro - blood sucking lawyer: convinces Muldoon to give him a shotgun and rides in jeep to try to rescue Hammond's grandchildren (both already dead). He is snapped out of the back during a chase scene with the T-Rex.\n\nIan Malcom and Alan Grant are navigating through the other dinosaur paddocks towards the visitor center when they stumble across the half built aviary and start searching for supplies. They are killed in the ensuing pterosaur attacks.\n\nDr. Henry Wu - lead geneticist: goes to retrieve some of the embryos after power is restored and a helicopter is called in for evacuation. He is ambushed by the escaped velociraptors and eaten.\n\nAt this point the remaining characters, Ellie Sattler, Gerry Harding, Robert Muldoon, and John Arnold tool up with shotguns from the gun cabinet, and the single LAW rocket launcher.\n\nDr. Hammond - despondent over the loss of his grandchildren and the colossal fuck-up that is his park, sits in the cafeteria eating ginger icecream rather than preparing to evacuate. He is murdered by Ellie Sattler with a shotgun.\n\nThe surviving characters head to the Safari Lodge to fortify their position until the helicopter arrives.\n\nEllie Sattler is disemboweled by ambushing velociraptors on the way to the Safari Lodge, although the other characters are able to kill the 3 raptors with their shotguns.\n\nRobert Muldoon, Gerry Harding, and John Arnold wait at the Safari Lodge until the helicopter arrives. They make a run for the landing pad.\n\nThe T-Rex attacks them on the landing pad and ends up destroying the helicopter, taking damage from the rotors in the process.\n\nMuldoon misses with the LAW rocket and flees the scene. Gerry Harding and John Arnold find their shotguns ineffective against the T-Rex and run into the jungle after Muldoon.\n\nGerry Harding - chief veterinarian: killed by falling down a mountain side while traveling to the north dock.\n\nRobert Muldoon - head of security: separated from the other survivors and killed by a pack of compsagnathus.\n\nEpilogue: The Chief Engineer, John Arnold, is picked up from the north dock of the Isle Nublar by the Costa Rican Navy. He is the only person to make it off the island. The Costa Rican Airforce napalms the island, killing the dinosaurs. The wild velociraptors stowed away on the supply ship (the one Dennis Nedry was trying to smuggle the stolen embryos out on) are never discovered and make it to the mainland and escape into the jungles. John Arnold dies of cancer several years after the debacle, the only witness to the tragedy that was Jurassic Park.\n\nHold onto your butts.",

        "text": "Like most of my stories, this took place in a homebrew setting where the rules were occasionally kicked out of the party so we could all hang out with Mr. entertainment and drink all his fun-flavored alcohol. Also, names have been changed to protect the innocent.\n\nSo the setting goes a little like this. In the near future, Europe and a bit of Asia is hit by an unknown wave of purple energy in the middle of the night. People and animals mutate into fantasy creatures, minor deities from all religions start popping up, people are suddenly able to use magic and a large wall of obsidian has popped up and surrounded the blast zone. The UN sends troops to guard this wall to ensure that nothing dangerous ever gets out. It's a brand new world and the times are changing, let's have some fun.\n\nThe group consists of Jack, who was Super Sneaks in a previous life and favored using a rifle despite guns not being able to be enchanted, Cody, formerly Archer Bro and a berserker who used his magic to augment his strength and speed, and myself who decided to be stealthy individual by using illusion magic coupled with a silenced pistol and a short sword. Looking back, I think I was going for what would happen if Big Boss put a level into being a wizard. We were just starting out in Greece, which had rapidly increased its power and influence due to its greater ability to create enchanted weaponry, and were helping out the local militia to repay the man who taught us how to fight, use magic, and speak other languages.\n\nShortly after an incident involving a circus, several skeletons and a modified Bop-It, we were sent out to help a local farmer. We get there and the man says that he is having a bear problem. We may be new but we're starting to get good by this point and we accept the job to kill the bear. The bear usually came to the farm at night so we decided to set up an ambush for the bear. Jack went up to the barn for a good sniping position while me and Cody dug a hole. Our idea was for Cody to get the bear to come near the hole so I could jump out and assassinate it. I jump into the hole and Cody covers it up. As we wait for nightfall, I start getting flashbacks to Vietnam sitting there in that spider hole.\n\nNight comes and we hear bear noises. At the edge of the farm, we see the silhouette of the animal, looking to eat someone. Cody insults its whole bear family and gets its attention. The bear starts charging, I'm still sitting there and hear the footsteps and roars coming closer. Right as it gets close, I leap out of my spider hole and swing at its neck with my short sword. As it connects, there is a shower of sparks, illuminating the area enough to show that this bear IS COMPLETELY COVERED IN BONE ARMOR. Suffice to say, my sword doesn't do shit. It stops its charge and turns to face me, yellow eyes glaring through the slits in the armor.\n\nI ran. I fled. I absconded. I got the fuck out of there!\n\nI run as fast as I ever had in my life and the bear chases after me. All the while, Jack was shooting it with his rifle but the bullets kept glancing off the bone and didn't even phase the thing. We ran in circles around that farm for over five minutes, I was basically working on adrenaline at that point. All we needed was the Benny Hill music and the moment would be complete.\n\nFinally, Cody thinks up a plan and yells at me to lure it towards him. Not in a position to come up with a better idea, I pivoted around, action rolled under the bear as it leaped at me and made a beeline towards Cody. Cody is slowly walking up like a cocky little shit and begins channeling his magic to augment his strength. I run past him and he takes a baseball swing at the bear with his greatsword as it passes. The sheer force is enough to make it reel back as the bone protecting its face shatters. I'm gasping for breath and am glad that at the very least it will be going after someone el-**HOLY TITS, WHY IS IT STILL CHASING ME?!! WHY! WHY!**\n\nI start running from the thing again until I'm basically unconscious on my feet. This time I start running towards the other two in the hopes that either one of them will kill it before it kills me or it decides to eat one them instead, I didn't care which at that point. In an unplanned turn of events, I was actually running at them at the perfect angle where Jack could aim at the shattered point on the bear's head. Now he just needed to make an incredibly pinpoint shot on a moving target and pierce through the thick skull of a bear and kill it before it ate his friend.\n\nA little bit on what Jack's specialty was. On top of training to be a marksman, Jack used his magic to create shields. This was mainly for the classic defense but he also could use it offensively by putting up sharp edged shields around weapons to increase their piercing potential. He used this on his bullets to give them armor piercing capabilities but it required a lot of energy to keep the shield moving with the bullet so he couldn't use it very often. Jack focuses his power and fires his rifle. A small yellow trail can be seen briefly in the bullet's path as it whizzes across the field and pegs the bear right in the weak point, bouncing around in its skull a little for good measure. The bear slumps over, not getting back up.\n\nThe other two were celebrating their victory but I wasn't able to join them. I was too busy puking my guts out from the surprise cardio workout and collapsed right there in the middle of the field. The farmer comes out of his house and offers to pay us but the others refuse, instead asking to stay the night so I could recover. We left the next morning, the others carrying my still unconscious body all the way back to town.\n\nSo that's the story of how I bravely ran away from a bear in the brave new world known as Europe. Fun times, you guys should try it sometime. ",

        "text": "As a DM, i try to leave a lot of room for improvisation; sometime things go wrong, but it can happen that leaving the players free to act however they see fit will result in most hilarious moments. This tale is about one such moment.\nThe adventurers (paladin, ranger, druid and rogue) where crossing a forest in a region overflowing with monstrous humanoids, monsters and huge wild beasts. At some point, one of them hears from afar a loud, approaching noise. The group stops for a moment, ready for combat; as time passes, the noise grows louder and louder. They start moving on the direction opposite to the noise, walking at first, running when the ground starts shaking under their feet. As the thundering source of the noise is getting closer, they are almost run over by stampeding herds of wild animals, but the worst is yet to come: behind the animals a massive wave of rampaging Stegosauri  is trampling over everything on it's path; only the sturdiest and tallest of the trees can survive the destruction the dinosaurs are causing. The party manages to find one such tree, a huge oak-tree, and somehow climb all the way to the top branches... but they are far from being safe: the running dinosaurs have no control on their direction, and many of them collide with the tree, brutally shaking it. the paladin and the druid eventually fall down, luckily on the side that still gives a measure of protection from the stampede... but it is obvious that the tree will not be able to endure many more hits. To escape a certain death, the only way out is a plan so crazy that it just might work... and IT DID, thanks to the most unbelievable series of high-rolls/nat 20's ever seen! \nHere is how it goes:\nthe paladin and the druid sit on the paladin's shield;\nthe ranger ties one end of a rope to one of his arrows and the other to his metal-reinforced bow;\nthe ranger &amp; the rogue jump on the back of a stampeding stegosaurus, miraculously landing safely between it's plates and immediately gaining a foothold;\nthe arrow with the rope is fired at the paladin, who immediately grabs it;\na few strength/dex checks later, two grown men are surfing among huge dinosaurs on a shield, the only thing keeping them alive (apart from sheer luck) a rope held by the paladin on the shield and a weakly elven ranger balancing himself on top of a stegosaurus' back.\n\nWell, this is it, my first contribution XD I'm sorry if there are mistakes, but English is not my first language.",

Our party agreed to meet a representative for the big scary organization in a popular pub. Of course we were ambushed by a group of people order to take us alive by a man we met in the first encounter of the campaign. My slayer had not been briefed of his importance but can just tell he was important. Our Wizard already has a favorite spell, Blindness and Deafness.  He rolled better initiative and decided to blind him which worked great. A few rounds of slicing people I run outside where the bad guy stumbled out to.     \n      \nHe was about 60 feet away so I attmpeted to hustle to him and tackle him. Natural 1, I run myself into a horse falling on my arse. The bad guy started rubbing himself with an ointment and attempted to fly off. I fire a special arrow I had made with a silk rope tied to it, got a great hit into his back and managed to grab a hold of the rope. Our alchemist runs outside and I yell at him to tackle the guy after we managed to yank him out of the sky. He rolls a 24 on the CMB tackle attempt and the 135 lb elf alchemist tackles the highest up bad guy we have met. I quickly put my masterwork barbed manacles on him and the two of us run away undetected. Just as that is happening our paladin slices a guy open through the front door where guards are now amassing.      \n       \nWe promptly ended the session with our wizard and paladin running for their life out the back door of the bar. the alchemist and I escorting a barbed evil dude through the streets and a GM satisfied but also flustered by our human kite tactics.

In our first couple encounters I did some neat things with snatch arrow and rolled pretty well for damage.       \n      \nIn our second encounter however a couple giant centipedes came out of a whole in the ground.

        "text": "Having been years since I was last able to have a decent group to roleplay with, I've been keen to play just about anything with anyone. During a trip to London, I was overjoyed to find that my friends were all 1. keen to try a tabletop game, and 2. all fans of Rob Cantor's Actual Cannibal Shia LaBeouf. Naturally, there was only one thing to do. So, sat down in our hostel room after a few games of Munchkin, I proposed one thing: a deadly game of wits and survival against the world's deadliest predator, Shia LaBeouf. They agreed.\n\nNow I consider myself a very novice GM, and have not had the opportunity to GM in years, so I considered what skills I did possess to be very rusted indeed. To that end, I used the example from the ACSLB pdf as a starting point.\n\nI also buggered up the rules massively throughout the game, but everyone was having a blast and crying with laughter by the end of it, and that's what's important at the end of the day.\n\nSo meet the unfortunate victims of tonight's misadventure: Kevin the stage magician, Michelle the internet troll, and Emily the hippy. \n\nGroggily they wake up in the middle of a house of mirrors, their reflections cast in an eerie glow by dim lamps. Together these strangers introduce themselves and try to piece together how they arrived here, checking their clothes and pockets for anything, anything that could help them.\n\nThen they hear the clawing. A faint patter of footsteps that came from everywhere, yet nowhere, all at once. The faint chorus of Latin chanting, *“Shiaaa....Shiaaa...”*. Seeing but three paths around them, they split up in search of the exit. Kevin to the north, Emily the east, while Michelle the south. Grotesque reflections of themselves surround them in the distorted mirror as they cautiously tread. Tall, skinny, fat. Their reflections stared back, Emily noticed, but as she walked, a shape appeared behind her, *Shia LaBeouf!* Crawling along the ceiling, naked and covered in blood, Shia *LaBeouf.* \n\nShe barely has time to scream before he's upon her, he drops from the ceiling onto the floor, prowling on all fours. He lunges and claws at Emily, opening up her arm, and blood starts pouring. My god the blood is pouring everywhere! Alerted by her screams, the others rush in the direction of her, Michelle readying a pocket watch, her only possession, to strike. They come across their grappling forms, and without hesitation Michelle strikes with her pocket watch, wielding it like a flail.  It connects with Shia's head, cracking open his skull and he hisses in pain, leaping 10 feet up into the shadows of the rafters above. Shia LaBeouf has retreated for now. \n\nBleeding profusely from her Shia stab wound, Emily stumbles to her feet. Kevin takes Emily's hippy scarf to use as a makeshift tourniquet to stop the bleeding. Agreeing that splitting was a bad idea, they move through the hall together, looking for the exit. Yet they are hopelessly lost. They come to a dead end. Trapped. No, they refuse, and begin kicking, punching, pounding at the wall. Cracks begin to form in the wood, splintering and snapping. Encouraged, they continue their architectural assault, while Michelle breaks a mirror and grabs a shard of glass. Soon enough the wall begins to falter, and with a solid push, a head-shaped hole emerges. Eagerly they look through. Michelle peers into it, and two eyes stare back. *It's Shia LaBeouf!* \n\nHe crashes through the wooden wall, and slashes open Michelle's thigh, but his neck is slashed open by the glass shard. His blood splashes everywhere, the floor and mirrors are covered in Shia blood. As they look through the Shia-shaped hole in the wall, they see it! The exit! Kevin digs into his pockets and pulls out a handful of fun snaps and throws them in Shia's face. They explode like little fireworks, blinding Shia LaBeouf. He leaps and punches Shia in the throat so hard that a fist-shaped splatter of blood explodes onto the ceiling. Enraged, Shia sinks his fangs into Kevin's neck before bounding out on all fours. Once again, they are temporarily safe from Shia LaBeouf.\n\nEmily and Michelle waste no time in trying to get the hell out of dodge, making for the exit. Kevin, fearful for Shia's return, instead crumples to the floor, playing dead, hoping that covering himself in Shia's blood will mark him as one of his own. As Emily and Michelle step outside, fairground lights flare to life amidst the pitch-black night, carousel music playing faintly. Yet for all the illumination, no sign of the exit was to be found. \n\nDesperate, they head for the nearest ride: the Ferris wheel, to gain a vantage point. Emily mans the controls as Michelle clambers into a cab. As she rises into the macabre sky, she sees it all: the rides, the fairground stalls, and there, like a shining beacon, the exit! They have a way out, a release from this nightmare- **clang, drip. Clang, drip. Clang, drip**. She stares up. Climbing down the steel beams like Gollum, it's Shia Labeouf! Blood oozes from his wounded, cannibal face, dripping onto the cab. Panicking, Emily quickly finds some rope and throws it to Michelle. She quickly ties it to the cab, but as she tries to climb out, Shia crashes onto the roof, rocking the cab dangerously on its rusted hinges. He swipes with his hands, catching Michelle across the face, blinding her with blood. \n\nRisking certain death, Michelle blindly leaps from the cab, and just barely grasps the rope. She rappels down, breaking her leg as she crashes to the ground. The cab rocks violently, moaning with strain, Shia digging his hands into the metal. Emily sees this for what it is, a chance to kill Shia LaBeouf, right there and then. With no hesitation, she presses the button to release the cab. But as it tumbles, Shia leaps from the roof down to another, and Michelle only barely rolls away in time to dodge the cab as it explodes into warped metal. She staggers to her feet, her broken leg hurting, but Shia LaBeouf leaps in front of them both. He slashes at Michelle's hand, knocking away her pocket watch-flail. \n\nHe raises his hand, prepared to deal a deadly blow, when a silver spear emerges through his stomach, his blood and intestines erupting everywhere. As he stumbles to his knees, a figure steps forward into the light. It's Kevin! He's stripped down to only his trousers, and his face, he has taken the blood of Shia LaBeouf and marked it like warpaint! “To defeat Shia, one must become Shia!” he roars as he charges at Shia, but Shia charges back, and claws at his side before leaping off into the darkness once more. \n\n“Shia is mine and mine alone to kill. Make for the exit, I shall stay and look for more weapons.” Kevin clutches at his side, losing blood from the jagged tear across his flesh, but he makes for the confectionery stand. He knew what needed to be done.\n\nEmily and Michelle immediately make a break for the exit, and as they run, they come to the merry-go-round. The horses prance on their poles, bobbing to the tinny melody. They stop to stare for a second, a second-long mistake, for as it turns, upon a silver stallion, rode none other than Shia LaBeouf! He stares at them with murderous intent, eyes wild with hunger. In a blink he leaps off the ride, taking his horse with him like a mighty wooden steed. As he lands on the ground he grabs it by the pole and swings it, launching it at the duo. Barely they manage to dodge it, but Michelle's broken leg forces her to the ground. The horse shatters, it's head landing at the feet of Emily. Determined, she picks it up, and launches it back at Shia. Her aim strikes true, as it soars towards his head, but Shia grabs it with his teeth! He tosses it up in the air, and as it falls back down his jaw unhinges like a snake, and he swallows it whole, his gaze once more turning back to the duo.\n\nSmelling the weakness and broken bone of Michelle, he charges at her, yet as he sets himself upon her, she ripostes by stabbing him through the neck with the glass shard. Howling with rage, and fearful of his seeming invincibility, Emily helps Michelle to her feet, and they continue to run for the gate, their only chance of survival. As they run, Shia's howls grow quieter, and quickly he is lost to the darkness of the night. \n\nKevin, too, hears the howls of Shia, and knows that soon the cannibal will turn his eyes back upon him. He has seen into the mind of Shia LaBeouf, peered into the madness in his quest to stop him. He knows that the only thing that can stop Shia, that have any chance of beating him, are but simple paper bags. He makes for the giant pick'n'mix stall. He vaults over the counter, sending bonbons and Berty Bassetts flying everywhere. There, amongst the gobstoppers and cola bottles, a sea of white-and-green striped paper bags. He grabs a handful of them and stuff them in his pockets, ready for Shia. As he moves back over the stall, he sees it: the air rifle stand. A new weapon to face Shia. He eagerly makes his way over. \n\nThere, waiting like it was meant for him, sat an old wooden air rifle. As he approaches the stand the lights blared into life, and the rows of targets began bobbing and weaving along their tracks. Little metal ducks, tugboats, rowboats, all moving along the track. But there, in the corner, was one that looked different, looked faintly....\n\n#**SHIA SURPRISE!** #\n\nBobbing among the targets, *Shia LaBeouf!* As soon as his cunning ruse is uncovered, he lunges forwards, scattering the targets. He strikes Kevin, death in his eyes, but Kevin manages to butt him with the rifle, and they both tumble to the ground. As they clamber to their feet, a scuffing sound turns their heads. Emily runs towards them, panicked. \n\n“The Gate is locked! We must-” she cries, but she is cut short as Shia lunges for her, and punches through her gut and out her back, intestines firmly held in his bloody grip. His mouth, dripping with blood from his forehead, moves towards  her head, as his jaw unhinges once more, ready to consume his victim. \n\nA sharp crack deafens the still air, and Shia howls in pain, a pellet-shaped hole spurting gory chunks from the nape of his neck. He turns his head 180 degrees, to see a silver barrel facing him, Kevin behind it fierce with menacing intent. He hisses and sticks his tongue out a Kevin. Kevin draws closer, and he sees – no wait, that's not a tongue! It's a smaller Shia LaBeouf head! Actual Cannibal Xenomorph Shia LaBeouf! It darts out a grabs the barrel, but before it can wrench it from Kevin's grasp, he pulls the trigger once more, sending a lead pellet straight through the back of the LaBeouf-tongue, sending its brains out through it's skull. \n\nPrimordial, ungodly screams erupts from Shia Labeouf, the essence of pain made audible. Unperturbed, Kevin only looks on with dead cold eyes. He steps forwards, grabbing one of his paper bags. \n\n“May you find eternal torment LaBeouf”, and with that placed the bag over Shia LaBeouf. Screaming, Shia LaBeouf begins to crumple like a paper bag itself, slowly stuffed into the pick'n'mix. He claws the ground for a hold, yet the asphalt grants him nothing. With a final grunt, Kevin forces the last of Shia inside his papery prison. Exhausted, he slumps against a lamppost, the dim light casting harsh reflections on his face.\n\n“Help me, Kevin, please!” Emily was lying on the ground, desperately clutching her innards. Deep down she knew that her life was measured in minutes. “Please, Kevin, please!” Yet Kevin doesn't respond, his back turned. “Kevin! Shia is dead, now help me, I beg you!” He turns.\n\nHis eyes glow with the same predatory fury that belonged to Shia. “Shia LaBeouf cannot be killed, for Shia LaBeouf isn't a being: Shia LaBeouf is a state of mind.” He paces towards her, and looks down. He only saw food.",

        "text": "Usually when I'm gaming I can be found slumped on the couch, pad held loosely, gawping at the TV. Last night I had one of those moments that takes you back to struggling past a big boss by the skin of your teeth or beating a jumping puzzle on your 20th try.\n\nI was on the look-out for a black box somewhere around Trella and had some time to spare, so dropped in at the nearest Nav Beacon to see what was going on. Not many ships around, and none that were wanted. I cruised around for a while, passing a wing of ships escorting a trader, and was about to continue on my way when a new ship arrived.\n\nAn Imperial Courier dropped in and started to zip around. I hadn't seen one up-close until now, and as I get close I realize the pilot is wanted. He's not harming anyone but has his hardpoints deployed, ready to ruin someone's day. And so, in my trusty old barely-upgraded Adder I ping off a few shots to get the Courier's attention. \n\nWhat followed was a ridiculous 20 minute battle between myself, the Courier and some passing Sidewinders who saw an Adder in need of assistance. I'm not sure why it took three of us to get through this guy's shields but with my new allies distracting the Courier we slowly chipped away. \n\nBack in the real world, I found myself gripping the controller tightly, my arms tensed right up to my shoulders, leaning into each turn and biting my tongue in concentration. \n\nWith the last dull thuds of my struggling comes-as-standard lasers, the Courier's hull rippled and tore open in a brief gout of blue and orange flame. I sat back in my seat, feeling my heart pounding, and took a moment to get my breath as my temporary sidekick Sidewinders peeled off and cruised away together. I realized I'd been squeezing down on the controller and relaxed my hands. \n\nThat tough 20 minute battle netted a bounty of about 16K but reminded me why I play this game. It felt like a losing battle for the first 10 minutes, and then as my silent friends joined the battle we started to gain the upper-hand. That final explosion was glorious.\n\nBut now I wonder, if an Imperial Courier can give me such trouble then how will I fare against the baddest pilots the galaxy has to offer...?",

        "text": "*so after my first entry [about my Cycloptic teenager writing in her diary about her winter time travels](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/37h2av/pathfinders_you_mean_i_have_to_write_out_my/). Pratena ( [The multi-classing teenaged cyclops with a compulsive punching habit](http://sta.sh/228ze9pctrg4) ) had not yet divulged into the incidents at Rockdust Lake when she got stuck there for 10 days. My DM [Mister Numbers/ 113420](http://www.reddit.com/user/113420) wanted to know exactly what happened. So! with a small prompt and some quick descriptions. I got Pratena to write it out! so enjoy my second installment of Pratena's diary (just don't let yourself get caught by her)!*\n\nDiary, \n\nI think it’s time I tell you about what happened in Rockdust Lake. I was trapped there for 10 days after hungrily wandering in. It was chaotic, made no sense, filled with war… **and I loved it.**\n\nIt started off by wandering into a small camp of orcs, luckily it was easy to win them over. The ones we fought along with and gave a tank had told them about me and my team. So they knew me already. They welcomed me with cheery grins and explained why they were on the outskirts of Rockdust. \n\nApparently this place is NEVER gonna settle down. They like the chaos too much and it greatly pleases Junaug to see a constant war. So when a faction gets too much power or manages to win, they come in and knock them down to continue the fighting. They’re own goal is to literally make sure that Rockdust stays in a state of constant war and carnage. I approve of this! I’m sure that my crew wouldn’t but… I’ll just keep my opinions to myself on that. \n\nAfter a good time talking about fights we’re all had and scar stories (My favorite was how one lost their eye to a Bug Bear) They told me about 3 parties at the lake that were starting to gain too much strength against the others. They invited me to help them with the first group. Of course I decided to help, it was going to be fun right? So we had a good night’s rest (I slept for a few hours then waited for them to get up) then prepared for the first move!\n\nThe first group we went for was called “Breaking Dawn”. Apparently they were all in this big group with the goal of wiping out anything not human. Apparently extremely religious and very very hypocritical. They were a fun bunch to charge in on! We didn’t wipe them out completely, that would have meant less for the conflict at the lake. The orcs called it “war weeding” like a garden. This had to happen to two others after this. Breaking Dawn’s leader kept rallying his troops and screaming how he’d “rip out my eye and use it as a trophy” but it was all talk and no actual action. He was too easy to take down actually. All these weapons and armor seemed to be old and broken but didn’t look like it was. I managed to corner him and he gave up and cried. He wasn’t worth actually killing… I let the orcs have their fun killing him instead while I worked on the rest of the troops still attacking. I found this super nifty Glaive while we were fighting here and I think Virkri will like it. It’s just the handle but it looks like it’s all there and not damaged, I think I’ll call it a Ghost Glaive. \n\nAt this point I think The orcs wanted to check on the other groups and saw thought I could do this on my own, so they asked me to deal with the other two. I agreed and said my good byes as they left and I made my way to the next group.\n\nThe second mini-nation I think they called BoggleDingBang from what the Orcs told me. It had a bunch of gnomes like the town near the base but none of them had any kind of structure. I’m surprised this place had so much power over other nations. I think something was said about them wanting the world turned to cheese? This one was pretty easy to knock down. All I did was take down their “leader”, this really eccentric artificer name Frumptious. He wasn’t that hard at all either… and I was getting hungry around this time. He tasted like copper and gouda cheese, most of them did. I only ate the ones that attacked me so it was self defense and I won’t leave good meat out to rot. Here I found this nifty balloon sword that will just never pop I think Thot will like and this fishbowl that never runs out of water and it had like 200 fish in it but I couldn’t figure out how it could fit all that fish. I think Lars will like the fishbowl, I hope he’s still around. With these little guys out of the way I made my way to the last one. \n\nThis last one was a lot larger then the other two. I guess they really didn’t pay attention to this one. Apparently the last guy who lead this thing called “The menagerie” was an invisible guy who’s army was crushed by a wall? I think this was what happened the last time the crew came and I couldn’t go. The whole group was a horde of monsters and creatures. Some new guy named Steven was in charge now and they seemed a little more… agricultural? They were trying to weaponize plants. This was a little weird. Though they had to be knocked down a few pegs either way right? So I had a big fight here, they were harder then the last group. Immediately didn’t trust me so the fight started almost as soon as I approached. I didn’t mind though. I probably had the most fun here (and the most food)!\n\nI got **really** disappointed though. This Steven guy? he was a TREE. **A TALKING. TREE.** He wasn’t even like the cool walking and talking trees. Nope. Just a tree. With a face. Guess what trees don’t like. **fire**. I knew a spell called Spark. I didn’t even wanna bother with a talking tree. After a lot of screaming and cursing my name he died though (I think it’s because I roasted some marshmallows with the fire his body was feeding). He was ash at the point I was done with my s'mores. Now with Steven gone I grabbed some bags and went back to where those orcs camped out. Turns out I grabbed a bag of catnip and some funny looking vials filled with red powder. I think Twiddlest will like the powder but I’m gonna give Virkri the catnip for his?her? pet cat. \n\nAfter telling my tales of the other two groups to the orcs, they gave me hearty congratulations and then helped me out of the mess of Rockdust and bid me farewell. The invited me back to help any time I would like. I may go back, but right now, I think spending the last month or so of winter at the base is more for me.\n\n-Pratena",

        "text": "\n\tI stumbled into your little corner of the internet a few nights ago, and thought someone might get a laugh out of my 4e shenanigans. A friend saw the 4e Dungeon Delve book, and thought it looked cool, so he decided to DM the first adventure. I had played some 3.5, and we are all general nerds, but no one in the group had played 4e at this point. Thus, this is the tale of Breach &amp; Clear Home Securities. Specifically, our first foray into the wonderful clusterfuck that is 4th Edition. \n\tA dwarven mine had been overrun by a clan of kobolds and the owner was offering a reasonable amount of gold for anyone who could reclaim his property. I caught wind of his plight and offered to  gather some mercenaries for his cause. A quick trip through the tavern later, I set off, ( Damon,  Tiefling Warlock) , with several interested adventurers in tow. Veil (Human Artificer), played by a friend of ours, Glide (Human Swordmage), played by the friend who's living room we had invaded to play the session, and Break, Glide's room-mate (Dragonborn Avenger). \n\tWe quickly discover that dwarf had left out some rather important information. Following his directions lead us to what looked like (from the outside), a fortified camp. Ten-foot walls on three sides, with patrols on the parapets, and a hill of broken gravel protecting the other side. Suddenly not the easy gold we had expected. The party hunkers down out of sight, and consider their options. At this point, I will point out Break's one and only redeeming feature. He gets shit done. Not well, not the way you want it, and not when you want it, but he makes things happen. Thus, while the sane members of the party are plotting to stealth up and quietly dispose of the nearest patrol, Break charges the walls. \n\tA couple of javelins come his way, but kobolds were never known for their aim. He gets within five feet of the wall, and jumps. He rolls. 20. 200lbs of dragonborn stops being on the ground and starts being atop the wall, sword hilt-deep in the nearest guard. Glide wisely decides that stealth is no longer an options, and runs in to help. Swordmages aren't known for their feats of athleticism, but they can teleport, so he gets up just fine and they start chopping vermin.   \n\tNeither Veil nor I can teleport, and we don't have a single hop between us, so we scramble up the gravel, with only a few slides back to the bottom. Everything in the camps is dead by the time we get there. Veil gets to patching up our minorly wounded crazies, and I go searching bodies. No loot in sight, but I find the way down into the mine. A hole with a rope ladder. Lovely. Veil breaks out a sunrod, cracks it, and tosses it down. He estimates a thirty-foot drop. \n\tBreak, with some fresh stitches, decides he is going first. Dude can leap walls, but can't hold ropes. He falls, hard. The rest of us shuffle down and Veil patches him up. A chipped tooth and a headache, but he's mostly fine. We fight our way down to the next floor, kill another half a dozen kobolds without anything too interesting happening. Somewhere in the fighting, we failed to notice that one of the little shits had run off. Turns out, perception is important. \n\tWe get to the end of the tunnel, and find a door. It's locked, and too thick to hear anything in the next room. No problem, Veil breaks out the lock-picks and goes to work. The second the door clicks open, Break kicks it open. No warning, just bootfucked it. This, is where we discovered the wonderful (and painful) world of readied actions. Turns out, the door leads to the owner's private offices, which had been co-opted by the kobold's leader. A white dragon wyrmling. Break proceeds to catch a breath-weapon and two kobold slinger stink-pots with his face. Glide charges the slingers, Veil and I set to work blasting the wyrmling, and Break does his best to keep his insides on the inside. \n\tWe kill the dragon (eventually), and take stock of our situation. Break is in several pieces, but still breathing. Glide is fine, somehow, but has maybe one spell left in him for the day. Veil spends the last of his healing getting our idiot-avenger walking. I have a new-found hatred of kobolds, and a need for clean leathers, but don't have any problems a nap and a tailor couldn't fix. Thus, was climb back out of the hole in the ground, intending to give our dwarf friend a talking to, and maybe “negotiate” a better reward. \n\tSomething isn't quite right top-side. There's a bonfire burning in the middle of the camp, and it smells like hell. A grizzled old kobold wearing some sort of skull for a helmet is standing over the corpses of his slain clan, chanting and waving his staff. He sees us and starts screeching furiously. None of us can understand him. Damon has a touch of OCD, and while he enjoys blasting enough to accept knee-deep gore as an occupational hazard, he has now had enough of the dragon-worshiping little vermin. I hadn't cast Flames of Phlegethos yet that day. Out went the curse, out went the Flames. Roll for the spell. 20. For anyone who hasn't read the spell, it's a whole glorious shitton of fire. Mr. Kobold Shaman is suddenly a neat pile of blackened bones at the bottom of a shallow crater. Damon decided then that he had a new favourite spell. \n\tAfter some surprisingly non-violent negotiations with the mine's owner, Veil and Break wandered off never to be seen again. Damon and Glide took their share of the pay and founded the mercenary guild Breach &amp; Clear Home Securities, which went on to be a successful, if moderately sketchy, company who did business across much of the Forgotten Realms. \n\n\t ",

        "text": "[PART 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/397cye/dd_5e_the_running_monk_part_12_the_backstory/)\n\nThe final day of training, the entire party is exhausted from being up for too long but fighting animals and survival skills kept their hands busy and their brains freed up to think about the final three coins. They noticed the soldiers watching them in a new, more careful light. Studying each action they made, consciously and unconsciously. Their formation had become military and they snapped to orders quickly and with no fuss, but under the quiet obedience was the innate hope that all soldiers have towards their superiors, the hope that they'll get the chance one day to stick their boot in with no repercussions.\n\nThe days training came to an end with successes and failures alike. Thought this evening was different. Normally the militia fell about and got on with whatever duties they had or went to go get something to eat, but this evening was different. Nearly every single man remained within the square, spread out with the party always in sight.\n\nIt was not a subtle attempt at watching the party and the effect of a whole lot of spying eyes was apparent on our vastly outnumbered party members. They decided they'd retire to the tavern until darkness fell because they needed a new plan and they needed it quick.\n\nAs they party fed themselves they observed out of the windows that the soldiers were moving away, but not towards the barracks. They filed into alleys and scrambled up ladders on to rooftops. They doubled up patrols and set up a perimeter of torches all around the square. They had learned the most valuable skill of being guards. They had learned to make a nuisance of themselves. It seemed that every last able bodied man was out that night to catch the party and the party rose to the challenge. Hoping beyond hope that their training was flawed enough.\n\nOur party members decided they would try to sneak out of the back before sundown and hide in some of the abandoned buildings until sundown, the tavern was too easily surrounded. The Warlock and the Rogue paired up, as did The Monk and The Bard and the Barbarian and the Paladin. The Warlock, Rogue, Monk and Bard snuck out together and settled in their pairs in two empty houses and waited. The Paladin with his heavy armour decided that sneaking was not going to work out well for him and decided to take an evening stroll, Happy went with him for no reason, because Happy don't care, Happy got places to be. The whole walk out of the gate the two were tailed on ground and by rooftop guards, being watched carefully. The Padre continued onwards to the gate where he was challenged by a guard who told him sundown was approaching and he would have to get inside. The Padre declared he was spending the evening in the wilderness, under the stars and was leaving the city. The guard waved him out.\n\nFifteen of the following soldiers also decided, 'Goodness, wasn't the countryside so beautiful this time of year? Why don't we use our new survival skills and go camping?' and took their leave of the town for evening.\n\nFive minutes walk from the gates and the Padre found a decent campsite, in the time it would take to set up he would think of a plan. Unfortunately, the guards were one campsite of thought ahead and promptly dogpiled the pair.\n\nNow, it should be noted to his credit that Happy managed to swat away three soldiers before another five wrestled him to the ground where he then struck the fear of his barbarian might into them with a shout and got loose before being tackled again by all eight and had a sock shoved in his mouth. At this point his rage was nothing short of an aid, as that sock came off someone's foot and that someone had been training all day.\n\nThe Paladin was outright subdued. Dwarves in Heavy Armour may be stout and fearsome but there are limits. And this was well past that limit.\n\nThe two were dragged back and jailed.\n\nAs daylight waned the four remaining party members were unaware that their large friends had already been removed from the game. What they were aware of, however, was that they kept hearing shuffling sounds and coughing near where they were hiding. They were not alone.\n\nDeciding that slow and steady was the best option they did well to move together for a time but the nature of the world is that sometimes the novice succeeds and the expert fails and here, they all failed together.\n\nA lit torch was thrown into the air and a series of shouts of alarm followed. The Rogue and Warlock stayed put but the Bard and the Monk panicked and ran for it. This worked in the favour of both parties as the running pair took the attention of the pursuing guards leaving the Warlock and the Rogue in silence.\n\nThe Monk quickly outpaced the Bard and left him behind. The Bard, not wanting to get arrested again split down another alley and their pursuers, number unknown in the darkness, split as well. The Bard continued to run and run before becoming thoroughly lost, twisted alley after twisted alley sped past but pursuit showed no signs of letting up. He noticed torches being thrown in air both in front and around him and as he rounded a corner into the square he found a group of ten militiamen waiting for him and another four cut him off from behind. Realising that he would have to fight he opted for his dirty trick and cast Crown of Madness on the lieutenant in front of him. The soldiers never finding out where the crown had come from at the barracks had themselves an answer, and as two held down the lieutenant the remainder flattened the Bard and took their opportunity to get some payback before jailing the bloodied man.\n\nThe Monk kept running, swiftly leaving pursuit behind with his natural speed. He failed, however, to notice when he was alone and kept on going. His thoughts lost in the wind rushing past his face that reminded him strongly of the ships he had spent his life on.\n\nThe Monk ran.\n\nThe Rogue and the Warlock waited for an hour to be sure they were alone, they heard no sound of shuffling or even breathing. Just the occasional flutter of a bat amongst the eaves of the empty houses. The made their move, sneaking at a snails pace from house to house. The pair reached a line of houses with upper floors that barred their way towards the Barracks they had made their target. \n\nThey snuck upstairs and decided that the rooftops would be an ideal place to take as a vantage, the Warlock descended to go outside and wait for the Rogue's directions though this plan was short-lived. As the Rogue hoisted her arms onto the roof she came face to face with a previously unseen watchman. The stared at each other for a moment. And for a moment longer. \n\nThe watchman reacted first, raising his voice in alarm and the Rogue let go of the roof to be caught flawlessly in the arms of the Half-Orc Warlock waiting below. The two proceeded to run. Both were on good form and continued to flee until they heard that pursuit was far enough away before hiding separately. The Rogue found an empty fireplace and hid in the chimney and the Warlock opting for another house found a wardrobe and decided that you couldn't beat a classic as far as hiding places are concerned.\n\nIt appears he didn't consider that the classic might beat him.\n\nHe entered the wardrobe and leaned against the back panel only to discover that the wardrobe had not been pushed back against the wall fully and with age and inattention, the back panel had come loose. He fell through and was wedged between wall and floor, his backside stuck in the gap and unable to move his legs or arms. The noise had brought the attention of the pursuers who, finding the Warlock, had a thoroughly good laugh at his expense before helping him up and giving him a pat on the back and a pair of special iron bracelets.\n\nThe Rogue decided that staying still for a while was the best option and took the opportunity to think for two hours, hoping the guards would get bored and assume she had given them the slip. She wondered how many of her friends had been caught and if any had managed to mark anymore. Her silent musings were interrupted once. The sound of a single man running sent terror up her spine and caused her whole body to clench but the runner passed at speed, followed closely by the sounds of five or six more giving chase.\n\nWaiting another hour for silence, just in case, the Rogue nodded to herself and left. Weaving her way flawlessly from house to house, behind patrols and over roofs she snaked her way to the barracks, marking men as she went past with her little pot of red paint.\n\nShe found herself at the barracks well after midnight, taking a look at the building she decided to look into a downstairs window. The building was empty, everybody was out on the streets looking for her and her friends. Suspecting a trap she entered the barracks and failed to find any, for the there were none. She left the way she had come and decided that next would be the Captain's quarters, on the other side of town. As she began to melt back into the shadows she heard a familiar noise.\n\nThe sound of fast moving feet and laboured breathing blazed past in the darkness, the echoes of lightly booted feet reaching into every dark corner. Though, if anything had been sleeping in those dark corners their rest was promptly disturbed by the sound the came after the feet. A sound that could only be described as a stampede.\n\nWaiting a little longer, our Rogue merged with the shadows and flickered from building to building. She moved unseen and unheard before she eventually came to the will illuminated road that was the last obstacle between her and the Captain's quarters. She thanked the Pantheon for her good fortune so far. Though it was not the Pantheon she should have been thanking. It was the Monk.\n\nThe day-dreaming runner was truly lost in some kind of homesick meditation, the body was present but the mind was far away. Dreaming of rigging and sails, of drinking and whaling and storms and fights. For hours it seemed the Monk was away at sea and hours it was. Until he saw a torch burning in the ocean.\n\nThe Monk snapped out of his daze to find himself face to face with the torches placed in the middle of the town square, exhaustion struck him like nothing he had ever felt before. \n\nThe Monk stopped running.\n\nHow long had he run for? \n\nWhich direction was bed? \n\nWhat was that sound?\n\nTwenty guards rounded the corner behind him and stopped. They stared at one another gasping for air. Behind the soldiers the Monk spied the Rogue making use of the distraction. The Monk decided that if a job was worth doing it was worth doing properly and that a Captain should go down with his ship.\n\nPirates are showmen after all.\n\nThe Monk straightened before the soldiers, corrected his clothing and delivered a flawless salute.\n\n'Gentlemen.' He said, 'Good morning.'\n\nOf course, it would be impossible for the Monk, the Rogue, the twenty soldiers or the forty onlookers on the rooftops to know this, but no one in the history of the world had ever been tackled by twenty men simultaneously before.\n\nThe Rogue continued her passage onwards, confident that she could make use of what had just happened before her to get the job done and go to bed.\n\nShe made it to the Captain's quarters and deftly picked the lock. Peering inside she saw an empty room with naught but a table and a lit lamp on the other side of the building. On the table was a coin, carved from malachite.\n\nEver suspicious the Rogue peered inside looking for the Captain. Finding that neither he nor anyone else was there she set foot inside.\n\nHer foot stopped briefly before sinking. She reflexively looked upwards to see a heavy bag of flour descending to meet her.\n\nIf only she'd looked for traps as well.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Captain had hated the bagpipes to begin with. Whilst he was learning the melody was always wrong and half the time he had made the terrible screeching sound akin to the sound farm animals make when you violate a whole barn at once. Though as he had learned he had realised that bagpipes require balance, focus and even attention to all parts of the instrument. If not enough effort was placed at one point the whole thing went wrong. Perhaps that had been what his Lord had been trying to teach him.\n\nPerhaps his Lord really did just love the bagpipes so much. Dwarves are tricky to read.\n\nThe Captain waited, until between the cracks of the houses he saw the light of day emerge from over the hills.\n\nHe took a deep breath in and started the day.\n\nIt was the Rogue's day he started first, because he began playing three feet from her unconscious body.\n\nThe party was released and patched up and escorted to the square. They were placed in their usual position, facing the now flawless formation with the Captain between them.\n\nThe Captain stopped and looked at his militiamen. No. His guardsmen. He nodded.\n\nHe marched to the centre and took place at the head of the formation, performing and about turn to face the party he bellowed in the perfectly practiced voice of every Drill Sergeant ever,\n\n'ATTENTION!'\n\nHe snapped a salute to the party and the formation behind him followed suit. The held for a while until the Captain lowered his hand and began clapping his hands, an action that his formation followed suit in.\n\nThe applauded the party and all the was done for them, they took turn in shaking the hands of each and every exhausted and battered party member.\n\nAfter all, there was nothing wrong with being a good winner.\n\n[PART 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/397cye/dd_5e_the_running_monk_part_12_the_backstory/)",

        "text": "(After much badgering from /u/Simplersimon I'm writing this out here, sorry it took me longer than it should've.)\n\n[PART 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/397ewq/dnd_5e_the_running_monk_part_22_the_final_night/)\n\nThis is a story from my first ever D&amp;D 5e campaign with myself as the DM and 5 friends, also new to it. What started out as using the Mines of Phandelver for one session turned into me improvising because I like to tell my own stories.\n\nOur characters include:\n\nToothless - The Monk - So called because he was the victim of a critical in his first ever fight knocking him to 0HP before he even got a go.\n\nLoudmouth - The Rogue - So named because she unintentionally says some very brutal things to other players.\n\nScapegoat - The Warlock - Blamed for everything on account of being part Orc.\n\nHappy - The Barbarian - Our motto for Happy is, 'Happy don't care. Happy got places to be.' Happy doesn't really partake in diplomacy or backstory but much instead prefers to be hitting things with large weapons and/or drinking. Nor do any of us actually know what places he has to be at.\n\nFlopsy - The Druid - Botched his initiative in his first ever fight, hit the deck. Bows out half way through to be replaced by Padre.\n\nPadre - The Paladin - Named after his service as a Paladin in the army of a noble. Has yet to cause/be victim to anything particularly awful. I am working on it.\n\nTrophy - The Bard - Really, really, really, really likes killing people. Named because he was found prisoner in a bandit camp the party liberated and subsequently claimed by the Warlock.\n\nI call them the Party Unencounterable. For some reason no matter how long this party travels for, the dice never seem to allow for Random Encounters.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the story of the Running Monk and the Training of the Phandelver Militia. I hope you enjoy it.\n\nOur intrepid party members find themselves within the limits of the run down town of Phandelver. Though town is an overstatement as years of avoidance by merchants and adventurers following an increase in goblin attacks has left the town down a fraction of its former self with a dilapidated palisade wall, an untrained militia of farmhands and workmen and a surprisingly well armed green pest problem.\n\nAfter a very close encounter with some bandits (that should have been much, much easier than it was Flopsy for God's sake) and sending some discontent farmers, builders and lumberjacks back to work (that should have been much, much harder than it was thankyouverymuch Toothless and my d6) our freshly bloodied adventurers are approached by the Captain of the Guard; an ageing warrior with a wealth of experience and an absence of good help who served a Dwarven noble all his life. He asked our non-human party for help training the militia of Phandelver as an increase in goblin attacks had him concerned about an all out offensive to take the town. \n\nOur morally ambiguous party found the concept of spending days systematically beating the daylights out of commoners without class features to be something that everyone who mattered could enjoy and promptly agreed..\n\nOf course, the party was not expecting what would happen once that daylight had indeed gone. But I get ahead of myself.\n\nThe first day consisted of learning to fight unarmed, with a demonstration between the Captain and Toothless the Monk as to 'King's Rules'. A fighting style in which two opponents stood before one another and took turns striking the other until one of the fighters didn't feel like getting up. The Monk, having recently ejected a rebellious lumberjack from the tavern and the town square outside the tavern with a single punch happily agreed to engage in pugilism with a middle-aged man.\n\nWho proceeded to beat him, decisively. Proving that age brings experience and that experience brings a high Armor Class.\n\nFrom there, the days training proceeded into unfair fighting and as the sun began to set a lot of militiamen limped back to their barracks or their homes with bloody noses, bruised knuckles and swollen testicles. Because we all know that girls fight dirty and can therefore conclude the female rogues fight the dirtiest.\n\nIt should be noted that the town of Phandelver in the centre of the Compass that I made up on the spot is very secluded. As such, the nights are silent. The surrounding countryside is pure serenity, with rolling fields and a hill line that, when the sun shines across it at dawn, causes light to laxly spill across the countryside like syrup across a pancake.\n\nThe Captain stood alone in the town square, waiting. Years of watches and vigils had left the greying man with a love for the minutes before dawn. Before the barracks turned out and every corner of every room was filled with the sound of training and boasting and belching. Before the wives and bird began their chatter. Before the Sergeant played the Wake Up Call on the instrument mandated by the reigning Lord.\n\nYou may also recall that our dear Captain's Lord was a Dwarf.\n\nAnd Dwarves love the bagpipes.\n\nThis awakening was beyond rude for all but Happy, the only Dwarf of the party. So, with the sound of the drone still buzzing in their ears our party and the militia were once again faced with another day and the sunlight crept over the town square, bringing with it the promise of clear skies and bloodied noses.\n\nThe days events considered of weapon training, with each party members splitting off with groups of the militia best suited for the weapon they were carrying. Finesse, versatile and heavy weapons were the highlight of the day, with Happy's axemen learning how to give a good battlecry whilst a barbarian is charging at you with murder in his eyes and glee on his face. \n\nIt was during lunch of the second day that the party found themselves as guests with the Captain. He confided in the party that whilst fighting was one thing, guarding was another. The Night Watch regularly fell asleep, blinded themselves with torches or got themselves killed because asking for help is, 'Not Manly'. The offered each of the party members a small pot of paint with a brush. Stating that for each guard found with paint on himself during morning inspection for the rest of the training would earn the party an electrum coin and, should any of the party find any of his possessions given to the troops at either the north, east, west, south entrances, the barracks, the healer's quarters or the Captain's quarters and take it without being noticed. The would bag them 5 gold per item. To make things interesting, he was now also imposing a curfew at sundown and a no-nonsense attitude to criminal activity. Anyone caught would be arrested and not released until the following morning.\n\nOur adventurers agreed to these terms. They began to build a solid plan based around stealth, unaware they were also digging themselves into a hole.\n\nAfter training, our party members elected to use the small amount of time they had before sundown to collect some intelligence. Each went to various spots, asking questions as to whether the Captain had given anything to anyone. They were met with moderate success, learning the position of 3 of the 7 objects and discovering that each was a large stone coin. Some were left on counters whilst others were kept in the possession of the on-duty guard.\n\nOpting not to take action, our wary travellers turned in for the night and prepared themselves for the bagpipes.\n\nIt was during this night that Flopsy the Druid disappeared without trace, track or even a suicide note. He was just gone.\n\nThe bagpipe reveille was no better the third day. Though it did attract the attention of a Dwarven Paladin from his prayers at the Healer's Chapel. He discovered a reasonably scruffy formation of soldiers and a handful of unreasonably scruffy adventurers. The Captain found himself in need of someone who found with a shield and, with the absence of such a fighter within the Party Unencounterable, the Padre agreed. His patron was the God of War, and believed that training didn't stop until you died and in that case you hadn't trained enough.\n\nThe days training in defensive skills, light armour and heavy armour was uneventful as the party found themselves thinking long on the evenings activities. The dear Padre, finding himself in good, trouble-finding company decided that he would stay and was promptly filled in on the coin and paint situation.\n\nOur party members decided that whilst they would use the paint, the coins offered much more of a bounty. The Rogue and the Bard decided that they would take the coin from the Barracks, which they had learned was kept near the entrance in a small kitchen and concluded that the best way to obtain this coin would be through subterfuge by disguise. Having successfully sneaked past the guards in the square using the darkness as cover they approached the Barracks and made use of their disguise kits to deck themselves out as guardsmen before boldly striding in.\n\nThere were no less than 10 soldiers on the ground floor between them and the coin. Their entrance caught the attention of the soldier currently making use of the kitchen who continued to stare at them as they walked through. It wasn't until they got closer to this solider and saw a look of realisation cross their faces that they realised their disguise wasn't working.\n\nAfter three days of being kicked in the balls by her, you wouldn't forget a woman's face either, would you?\n\nFlight was as viable an option to the pair as it was to the dodo as the guardsmen subdued and arrested them both. Shackling them within the cells under the barracks.\n\nThe Warlock and the Monk were met with much greater success, in attempting to discover the location of another coin they were able to mark the tunics of four guards without being discovered at all before learning the location and retreating for the night. The plan was to find all the coins and take them in one fell swoop.\n\nThe best laid plans of mice and parties with no Men gang aft agley.\n\nThe next day shrieked into existence as all were woken from their slumber by the bagpipes. Before making his way to the square a newly appointed lieutenant inquired as to the intention of the Bard and Rogue. They managed to bluff their way into saying it was a test requested by the Captain and the lieutenant let them off the hook.\n\nThe militia were formed into a borderline respectable formation for inspection. The Captain spent a painstaking length of time looking at each man for anything amiss. The four marked guards from the night before were called forward and given a dressing down that would have made a level 20 barbarian blubber. They were given latrine duty and the entire formation found themselves suspicious as to how the red marks got there.\n\nAnother days fighting, with all the weapons and armour broke out. With some incredible lessons and some awful lessons from different members of the party taking place. The day ended with some sport with the bow, a number of soldiers were given the option for promotion if they could shoot three pumpkins thrown from a rooftop before they could hit the floor. Two succeeded, two did not. Earning themselves promotion to lieutenant and a handful of troops to command.\n\nAgain, night fell and with it the curfew came into place. Our regal heroes scurried into the darkness to see how much of a nuisance they could make of themselves. Intent on marking as many as possible and finding as many coins as luck would allow. \n\nThe Bard wished to try his luck once more at the Barracks and made his way there himself, ducking out of sight of the new rooftop watchers. The bowmen, it seemed, were already being put to use. He opted this time, to leap onto the house next to the barracks and enter through a first floor window. A good idea, but his jumping capability fell short. On this occasion, by short I mean he grabbed the edge of the roof tore off a tile and fell to the ground making a lot of noise. This attracted the attention of a wandering patrol and the Bard, finding himself in a dead end incapable of getting on to the roof decided the next course of action would be to run. This activity was short lived as he the fall left him slowed and he was promptly run down, tackled, shackled and dragged to the cells for a second night. \n\nThe Paladin and the Barbarian found where the Healer's coin was, decided they'd done their share and went to bed.\n\nThe Rogue decided that greed was the option for the evening and took one of the coins, marking a few as they went.\n\nThe Monk was caught pickpocketing another coin and was arrested.\n\nThe Warlock, seeing the Monk getting arrested decided that he would take it slowly, and made careful use of the paintbrush and Mage Hand.\n\nBy the next day, another four had been marked and the first coin taken.\n\nBagpipes, shouting at those against dress code, training, night time!\n\nThe Bard, decided that stealth was no longer fun and opted instead to sneak up the the Barracks, open the door a little and then throw his pot of paint at a solider before casting Crown of Madness on him causing him to freak out and cover another two men in paint in his throes of rage before being knocked out. The Bard, happy that he had given a man lead poisoning, slept with a smile on his face.\n\nThe Monk relieved the coin he had failed to get the day before, but not before having to reveal himself before marking a soldier. The soldier, evidently acted on orders to act like he had been killed, continued his patrols with a whole load of internal hatred but also a whole lot more aware of his surroundings. The Rogue had intended to prevent this by providing support but failed to notice the lieutenant who had been following her since nightfall who promptly saw his opportunity and subdued the Rogue whilst she was isolated.\n\nThe Warlock also had to do the same at another gate with another coin for the party.\n\nThe Rogue had followed the Captain after training and found he resided in a tiny house behind the tavern. In the short time before sundown, she knocked on the door with the intent of inviting the Captain to dinner with the party. He answered the door with no shirt on and covered in sweat before promptly regretfully declining the invitation and shutting the door on the Rogue's face.\n\nThe Barbarian and the Paladin entered the Chapel that housed the Healer and, unable to shake the Healer for the purpose of stealing the coin in peace, painted a streak across his face and took the coin. \n\n[PART 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/397ewq/dnd_5e_the_running_monk_part_22_the_final_night/)\n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/395cvz/rome_total_war_barbarian_invasion_in_defense_of/",
        "text": "I played as the Western Roman Empire, wanting a bit of a challenge. Expecting a full invasion through Gaul, I spent most of my extra denarii building barracks in the Gallic provinces and generally moving most of my armies to the Rhine. By contrast, the Balkans had about one full army in operation, and mainly composed of Limetanei and Foederati Infantry (the worst and second worst type of infantry that realistically can hold a battle line). If any invaders entered through the Balkans, I thought they would do so from the South into Salona (near modern-day Split, Croatia), and not into Acquincum (modern-day Budapest, Hungary). As such, Salona was more heavily guarded with better quality troops, such as Comitatenses.\nIt shocked me doubly when the Roxolani invaded Roman territory for two reasons: first, I thought they would have ventured west into Germania, perhaps eventually Gallia, and second, that they invaded near Acquincum and not Salona. Acquincum, at the time, was guarded decently, having two generals (Oppius and Spurius Flavius), two units of Comitatenses, three units of Limitanei, one unit of Foederati Infantry, two units of Archers, and two units of Sarmatian Auxilia. By contrast, the two armies laying siege were full of horse archers and spearmen, as well as having the King and Heir of the Roxolani tribe. As a precaution, I send the disinherited Leontius Flavius from Salona with roughly seven Comitatenses north, hiring some mercenary Veteranii (basically a stronger version of Comitatenses) along the way.\nThe two Roxolani armies press the attack with the army of Leontius just outside the city. Since the two armies are attacking from opposite sides of the city, I devise a plan. One unit of Limitanei is to guard the gate from which one army is attacking and the unit of Foederati Infantry is to guard the gate from which the other army is attacking. The rest of the infantry guards the four possible entrances to the city plaza. The cavalry (the bodyguards of Oppius and Spurius as well as the two units of Sarmatian Auxilia) also each pick a side to guard. The archers are stationed inside the city plaza, safe as long as all four entrances hold. The plan is for the reinforcing army of Leontius to split into two and flank the attacking armies while the gate defending units attack the front. The city plaza army, commanded by Spurius and Oppius, will be a fall back in case that fails.\nThe battle commences, but the reinforcing army of Leontius does not arrive (the computer could not handle that many soldiers at one time, a common problem). The armies attack, and as expected, decimate and rout the unit of Limitanei and Foederati Infantry supposed to guard the gates. They flee towards the plaza. Effectively, all hope is lost.\nThere is a silver lining. The towers still belong to Rome, meaning they shoot arrows at the invading units as they snake around the city, trying to find an entrance to the plaza. In order to minimize casualties, the armies run to the plaza, tiring the units. The initial defense are rather effective: between the casualties inflicted by the gate defending units as well as the towers, roughly 15% of the two armies fall before engaging the main force.\nIt, however, pales in comparison to the remaining force left. All four plaza entrances are attacked, and defending the entrances is no small task, given that each side is outnumbered. However, repeated cavalry charges orchestrated in rapid succession rout many of the initial enemy spearmen as well as some of the enemy horse archers. The slaughter continues, and it starts to look like maybe the battle will be a Pyrrhic victory for the Roxolani.\nFaced with either having their armies whittled down or risking the bodyguards of their King and Heir, the Roxolani nobility charge into the fray, decimating the two remaining Limitanei. The only unit guarding the lion's share of the Heir's army is Oppius and his bodyguard unit. The elite Comitatenses are busy holding down the King's army, and are doing so extremely well. The entrance adjacent to the entrance Oppius is guarding is guarded by Spurius, his bodyguard, and the Sarmatian Auxilia. Because that entrance is not being attacked heavily, I send Spurius as well as one unit of the Sarmatian Auxilia to aid Oppius, who is in extreme danger. The remnants of the Limitanei also help. The Sarmatian Auxilia, both units, get battered beyond help, to say nothing of the Limitanei. The forces effectively have whittled down to the bodyguard units of Oppius and Spurius, the two archer units, as well as the to Comitatenses.\nIn rapid succession, two miraculous things occur which change the tide of battle. First, when Spurius charges in, he and Oppius take on the bodyguard of the Heir. The Heir attempts to retreat and let the rest of his army whittle down the guard. This proves a mistake, as Spurius lands a fatal blow upon him. The entirety of the Heir's army, disheartened, exhausted, and decimated, rout.\nThe second miracle occurs a few seconds later. When the Heir's army flees, the reinforcing army of Leontius arrives (the computer finally had freed up enough space). However, he arrives on the side that the Heir's army had attacked from, meaning that he will not be able to flank the King's army. The AI-led army of Leontius decides to go mop up the routing army of the Heir.\nSpeaking of the King, his army has been cut down for the most part by the Comitatenses. Besides his Horse Archers, which have been engaging my archers unsuccessfully, his bodyguard unit is the only battle-worthy unit in the army. He charges at one of my units of Comitatenses instead of accepting defeat. I rush the other unit of Comitatenses at him, as well as the bodyguard of Oppius. Through some stroke of luck, however, he makes his way into the plaza and attacks my archers. I decide to put my archer units into tight formation and send the Comitatenses units as well as Spurius to rout the remainder of the army while Oppius and the archers will engage the King. Oppius flanks the King, attacks while his back is turned, and kills the King right in the center of Acquincum.\nThe remainder of the King's army flees, ending the battle. Oppius and Spurius snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.\nThe city of Acquincum, still Roman, recovers. Leontius and his army, still near full strength, are ordered to mop up the remainder of the armies before fortifying a bridge where he gains an easy victory over the rest of the Roxolani army, lead by a new family member. He then returns south to Salona with his massive army, where Rome has heard reports of its Eastern counterpart being crushed by Sarmatian hordes. The valiant generals, Spurius and Oppius, part ways. As a reward for their valiant actions in battle, each gets rewarded a province: Spurius keeps Acquincum and Oppius governs Carnuntum, formerly governed by the now-deceased Emperor Valentinian.\nPerhaps, in time, the other barbarians of Europe will attempt to capture Roman lands. The Sarmatians already have. For their sake, I hope they learn their lesson and ally with us instead. Roma invicta!",

        "text": "I got a rep for playing overly cautious after several 0 death campaigns when everyone else lost'em willy-nilly, so decide to make crazy, first-in-the-fight character, tell DM my goal is to see this guy die. I won't be excessively stupid or suicidal, but will die at least once. DM takes that as a challenge, tells me I have to play a character who wears full plate and carries two shields. I even find a prestige class for that to make him happy (snapping something-or-other-that-means-turtle). Give him a backstory as a Turtle farmer, from a long line of turtle farmers. He worked off the belief that the best offense was a good defense... that you could hit people with. And his name was Roy Cooper.\n\nThe RNG has never been so nice to me as it was in that campaign. Cooper was impossible. He was convinced that he'd never die, and as the campaign wore on, we all started to think he was right. We made it through to near the end without a single death, because no one could hit Cooper, no one could get past him, and if we could help it, no one got to the rest of the party without going through him.\n\nThere were some great moments in the campaign, from the first time he held off an army trying to cross a bridge, to the time he went back to the farm, from his stint as a human cannonball, to the the day he was acting king of the myconids. And he lived all the way to the final battle.\n\nOur nemesis from the beginning had been an evil mage who was just trying to take over a nice kingdom to rule in his twilight years, and we were having none of it. His final attempt was to open a gate to the Abyss and let an endless demon army pour out. We screwed up, and he got it open in the middle of the castle. But, it was only man-sized, and the rest of the party was fighting him to keep him from expanding it further.\n\nCooper saw a man-sized hole and knew just how to fill it. He charged up, pushing a couple demons back through, and started doing what he did best: blocking. The fight was long and hard, our cleric was banished to one of the nine hells, the monk was torn in two and used to try and expand the gateway, but it failed when our rogue set the corpse parts on fire using a scroll he'd stolen of the mage during his villain monologue.\n\nFinally, the rogue got a killing blow, and turned to see the gate collapse behind me. The DM let us know that Cooper's back was against the empty space at the edge of an Abyssal plate, essentially meaning no one could get behind him. He had magical items that made sure he would not need to rest, or eat, or drink, or even breathe. It was never said officially, but I like to think he's still fighting the endless horde, getting better and better, and wondering the whole time, \"Where the heck is that rogue?!\"",

        "text": "This is the tale of a game of Exalted, and one of my favorite characters that I put little to no effort in.\n\nThe game was a mix of regular and modified Exalted, where the dragon blood daughter/descendant of the Scarlet emperor was the one to take the throne. About all else I could remember is things were taking place 700 years later, around when she was going to die. And common tech had, to an extent, developed to being like our modern tech.\n\nMy character was a perpetually drunken Dawn cast, who drunk dialed Sol Invictus too many times, and with a limit break involving sobriety.\n\nAnd the other two were two Lunars, one played by the ST who was a Lunar fanboy and the other was played by an RP'er.\n\nThe way my character met theirs was some criminals of some sort(gun runners at least) were smuggling essence cannons and decided to fight close to him. So of course I joined in, and beat them with their own warehouse while they were inside. And they never noticed.\n\nMy character had only a point or two in stealth and I had some spare charms I didn't much care about and got an excellency in stealth. So this succeeded massively with multiple 10s.\n\nAfter I was done beating those criminals to death I met the rest of the party, then did a hulk jump to a bar. Of which they followed me too. While at the bar there was drinking and revelry, followed by this character whose name never mattered much getting an orgy to happen with another stupidly well rolled presence check.\n\nFor the rest of the first and second session this guy would enter and leave scenes with hulk jumps when possible, suggest just beating what foes had to be dealt with using large things like mountains, and pulling off BS well rolled checks.\n\nThe game never went past the second session, and the guy who was the ST of the game just sort of forgot about nigh on to everything but my character. Who is a running joke between me and my group of friends still.",

        "text": "I shall tell you the tale of our most recent two man session, which is a branch off our current escaping from chaos campaign where all people in the original party were thrown in prison and had to ESCAPE at level 0. \n\nCharacters (currently level 4)\n\nTilliam / Human / Bard\n\nEtnovam / Tiefling / Rogue [Me]\n\nSo the night of our campaign comes to a close, and the dm says, \"if anyone wants to keep going, i'll be up for a side adventure and a little more RP. So being that this was a Friday night, I said why not!? \n\nThe \"night\" of RP with the rest of our group ended with Etnovam having a performance duel with our group's trigger happy bard at the local inn of Red Larch.\n\nEt's an Entertainer Rogue, and Tilliam, is a Bard. So as the performance is going on, both play and sing wonderfully.... but Etnovam won the [night](http://s1.postimg.org/kep86zbn3/the_duel.png).  \n\nThis is where the companions of our campaign step to bed while Et looks over to the bard with a sort of smug but goofy smile (the bard is very quick to anger and enrage) and Et goes over and says \"i have a proposition for you\". The bard scoffs and is pissed at the interaction, flaws be damned, and condemns the interaction. With smooth words however, the Rogue convinces him to follow him to the Merchant of the town's shop in the morning, so that they can maybe do a job for Volvo, a business relation of Et that is an NPC.\n\nUpon entering the shop it is revealed to Et that Volvo has had his merchandise stolen south of town, and would appreciate Et and Tilliam going after the culprits as soon as possible. Volvo also notes to Et that the culprits have also stolen merchandise that he had ordered earlier in the campaign and had already put a 100gp down payment on. The two of them accept the quest, and when they do Volvo tells them that he also wants them to bring back a \"boar\" that was in the shipment as well. \n\nWith the two of them not being as sturdy as can be, They make their way back to the inn, Et calling out a request saying \"if anyone wants to make some quick coin and can take a punch, let me know\".\n\nOut comes a half-Orc, Scunion. he repeatedly asks for half of whatever the profit is, and no matter what. The bard and the rogue try to bargain with him and they make no leeway. Upon a little negotiation the rogue tells him that he will get half of all *gold* that is involved. \n\nThey make their jolly way to the camp, and see the bandits. next to the camp is Volvo's merchant wagon and inside a black BEAR.  Et asks the Bard should he begin the assassination of these bandits or should he try to talk to them to squash the situation. Tilliam says to strike, and Et takes an assassinating shot to the one closest to the wagon, killing him instantly. \n\nHe takes cover behind  the rock as the bandits begin their assault. a couple of turns later and the bandits are all dealt with accordingly.Sadly the bear was let go in an attempt to kill them, however the bard, rogue, and orc was not in the line of sight for the bear to try to attack. As a result, the bear ran off into the nearby woods. \n\nUpon searching the cabin and the bandits, it appeared that the wares Etnovam had sent for had already vanished probably shipped or sold, and with the bear gone, going back to the shop would be in bad taste. Et would be returning from his accepted quest with no success for anyone involved other than stopping the bandits themselves. At this point Tilliam and the half Orc are about to make their way back when a darkened Et approaches from the cabin, his mind already focused on how to make his business relationship with Volvo not go sour because of this failure on his part. \n\nThe Half-Orc NPC that they hired must have had a low intelligence because he asked Et as he left the cabin \"Half of the wagon\", in which the rogue said \"You said half of the Gold, we have found 400 gold, take your 200 pieces and leave.\" The Orc looks again to the already pissed off rogue who could care less about 'coin' and says \"half of the wagon\". The Rogue who is already pissed at the whole ordeal of not getting his wares which he already put a down payment for and losing track of the *bear* they were meaning to bring back to Volvo goes dark for a second and throws the 200 gold to the half ogre and states \"there's your money. Leave.\"\n\nOf course the Half Orc attacks. \n\nBeing that he is an assassin who is constantly on the alert for any foul movements, Et sees that the Orc is getting hostile. Because he is so close to the bard his first reaction is to get in close and strike with his rapier to sort of protect his fellow adventurer and end it quickly, but due to him not being so focused on striking and more on what he would be saying after to Volvo, he misses his strike (That and I **forgot** that he had advantage from attacking before Scunion). As his reacting strike Et is knocked out from the orc in one blow. \n\nThe bard, seeing that Et was out of whack in the way he was acting is now face to face with the orc, whom he is trying to calm down. \"Don't mind him, he's just a greedy bastard I'll personally knock him out even further for you when i take him back to the group\". \n\nThe Half Orc Still attacks Tilliam. \n\nWith quick thinking he casts Hold Person, which effectively stops the rampaging of the orc. He heals the Tiefling Rogue who is effectively scared of getting hit again, as he has such a low constitution, literally one hit takes him out. he throws ball bearings down as he backflips away beginning his rain of arrows on the paralyzed body. \n\nThe orc is so strong that even though it goes for several rounds with the Human striking with his rapier and dagger and the rogue shooting with the hand bow, he still finds a way to stand paralyzed and viciously look to kill them once he can. Seeing that there's enough time wasted on this situation Et pulls out his wand of magic missile and knocks him unconscious. On the Orc's turn he wakes (nat20 death save) and is charging for our bodies and souls. The bard casts thunder wave and puts him down, both of us barely making out of a battle that shouldn't have happened. \n\n\"I'm taking all the gold\"\n\n\"Hahaha! No. **No** I'll gladly give you 300 out of the 400, but that's because I believe you did do great work here today.\"\n\n\"that's a load of bullsh-\"\n\non an insight roll, the Bard and Rogue notice that one of the bandits is wearing a very nice cloak that when Et looks at it realizes exactly what Volvo had ordered to help him \"sneak around\". When Et was in the shop 2 days earlier, he requested Volvo to find him an item to help him sneak around better because of his low health and ability to take a punch and Volvo passed him a note saying he had something in mind if he could get it shipped down. Without knowing what it was, Et agreed to make a 100 gp downpayment and 400 gp payment once it actually arrived, with Volvo noting that the item was worth MUCH more, just he was doing this as a favor for them saving the village. \n\nIt was a Cloak of Elvenkind. \n\nThe instant the Tilliam saw that this look in Etnovam's face he snatched up the cloak and stated \"this is mine now\". \n\nIn which Etnovam went into a rage, proclaiming \"it was his, and he already payed for it's \"preorder\".  Tilliam proclaims that \"there's no way to trust a rogue, especially one that proves to be so *greedy*\". Etnovam says \"In that case why don't we just BRING it back to Volvo, i don't trust you knowing that you've *killed* innocent civilians to make an attack that didn't even harm your intended target\"\n\n\"I healed your ass when you were dying! I could have left you to die!\"\n\n\"This has nothing to do with the business of this land. it's not yours, it's not mine, it's Volvo's!\"\n\n\"No i'm taking it\"\n\nIn a gut wrenching test of Dex and strength and Etnovam jerked the cloak out of Tilliam's chaotic little hands. with the bard having a face of a grumpy school child. \n\nthey walk back to the Shop, where Etnovam proceeds to pacify the rage of volvo by paying his *boar* situation off (300 gp), and then paying 400 gp to the shop for the cloak as promised. The Tilliam's laughing in the backround because he think that the Tiefling's being ripped off for paying for the bear and not only that but paying so much for a damn cloak. Meanwhile Etnovam is pissed because he may have gotten the cloak, but is more worried about the future relationship between himself and Volvo. \n\nThe life of an Entrepreneur is rough when you're a rogue.\n\n#RogueRules \n\n(and btw i honestly think that bard is Chaotic Evil lol)",

        "text": "So me and some friends just started up a session of Pathfinder. We technically are all fairly inexperienced role players but we're willing to learn.\n\n**The Cast**\n\nMorgan Liventchi- A young, starry eyed half elf wizard and the youngest of three of a national hero. He is a complete mamma's boy though, caring very little about his father's legacy, and is adventuring so he can help those in need. Played by yours truly.\n\nDelvin- A ratfolk rogue who served as a treasure hunter for a relic obsessed noble until the noble was assassinated by rival groups and he was forced to flee for his safety.\n\nCandryll Storge- An aasimar paladin who is on a journey to deliver some religious scripts. He's basically playing delivery boy between the churches.\n\nMuuka &amp; Kiji- A tengu pair comprised of bard and monk respectively who travel together in search of high adventure.\n\nSo we begin with the usual setup of us all walking into a tavern. For some strange reason, everyone, the barkeep especially, was staring a bit too long at Delvin. Most of us are all sitting by ourselves when Muuka asks Kiji if she wants to play a card game. They start up and the GM asks for a 1d100 roll to see who wins. Kiji rolls decently but Muuka rolls a 1. He tries to shuffle but ends up spraying cards everywhere, braining Morgan, Delvin, and Candryll with the aces. We take it in stride, return the cards, give our introductions and ask to join in.\n\nIt's at this point that the food Morgan ordered arrives. He takes a bite and nearly spit it right back out. \"Blech! This stuff tastes like raaaaaaaa-\" he stops, looking at Delvin the ratfolk sitting right next to me. Morgan glances back, the barkeep is still staring at Delvin, a small trickle of drool collecting on his chin.\n\nSo we all start playing the game and roll a d100. Most of us roll decently, Muuka rolls another 1. This poor bird man just rolled a 1 on a d100 twice in a row, shit was lost. This time when he shuffles, the cards just explode into flame, flying all over the place and burning a hole through the table. We're all looking for something to break the awkward silence when a man bursts through the door. He keeps screaming about a bunch of ogres and that they took \"Murphy\" from him. Being the kind of guy who can't say no to a person in need, Morgan consoles the man and runs off to where the ogres were last sighted. Candryll is close behind and the others tag along because it might be entertaining.\n\nWe get to the ogre camp at night fall and see 3 sitting by a campfire and one on his own. A quick powwow later and it's decided that Delvin snipes the loner while Morgan casts sleep on the others. Morgan manages to put two of them to sleep but Delvin completely misses his shot, alerting the ogres still awake and initiative is rolled. Muuka jumps out of the bushes and does his bard stuff to intimidate the ogres. This completely fails as one of them charges at him with a spear. It hits for max damage and Muuka gets dropped immediately. To recap, this guy has not had a single good roll yet and just got dropped in one hit. It'd be funny if it weren't so sad. ~~What the heck, I'll laugh anyway~~\n\nWe rush in to whack the two ogres who ganked our friend. Candryll got buff from my enlarge person and started swinging has warhammer around, Morgan was throwing telekinetic fists, Kiji was using her regular fists, and Delvin shot into melee and barely missed drilling one into the back of Kiji's head before we grilled him enough on it to start flanking with a short sword. Meanwhile, Muuka is casting cure light wounds on himself. He rolls. He gets minimum healing, he's still in the negative. The next round he casts another, this one also does minimum healing but it's enough to get him to one health as we are finishing up. The one remaining ogre tries to run to his sleeping companions but Candryll runs up and golf clubs him through the nearby tent, killing the ogre and pinning the one that was in the tent under the debris while Morgan and Kiji rained blows on its confused head.\n\nThe fight was over and Delvin was going around executing the ogres that were still asleep. Muuka, still at 1 health because all his spells were gone now, walked over and opened the flap to the biggest tent. He finds a cultist chanting to a blue fire on a pedestal (Oh now I get it). The cultist turns around and swipes at Muuka with his dinky little dagger. It connects and Muuka is downed again. Guy could not catch a brake.\n\nKiji runs up to aid her unlucky buddy but is grabbed by the cultist. Fortunately, a well placed grease spell from Morgan allows her to slip out before she gets stabbed and Candryll draws agro. Kiji rolls a heal check to stabilize Muuka. Crit fail. Of course it was a crit fail, apparently his bad luck affects those that help him. The poor guy has gotten nothing but horrible rolls and has gotten dropped at the very beginning of combat twice now. He says absolutely nothing. We find that this is because he has left the call and gone to bed for the night due to extreme dehydration from massive amounts of salt. We laugh at his misfortune, Schadenfreude at its finest.\n\nKiji drags Muuka off into the forest so she can just do a take 10 on the heal check to stabilize him and we finish off the combat. Candryll brings his mighty hammer down and lands a crit. The word we used to describe the scene was \"tomatoed\". We all loot the area and begin to head back to town.\n\nMe- \"Wait a minute, where's Murphy?\"\n\nGM- \"Oh right. Well, if you would look over here\" He points over to the half-eaten remains of a dog.\n\nMe- \"Oh................. Morgan runs away crying.\"\n\nWe all get back to town, Muuka back on his feet, and inform the man of the fate of Murphy. He goes to the bar and drinks his sorrows away. The barkeep is appreciates what we've done and offers us all rooms for the night.\n\nDelvin- \"Even me?\"\n\n\"Especially you\" the barkeep says, licking his lips.\n\nMorgan goes up to his room to take a bath and wash the blood off of his clothes left by the cultist that got tomatoed. He then sits down with his rabbit familiar and reads a book until he falls asleep.\n\nAnd so began the adventures of this ragtag group of people. Not the greatest of beginnings for some, especially poor Muuka, but hopefully they'll all live to do great things in the near future.",

        "text": "Continued from:\n\nPart 1: http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/38w9ei/grasp_the_sky_a_space_opera_adventure_adventure/\n\nPart 2: http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/38wa39/grasp_the_sky_a_space_opera_adventure_adventure/\n\nOur heroes have a long discussion regarding tactics. Just how they're going to approach this problem. Antonio, Donny, John, Rozie, and Leontyne and his researchers arm themselves and split up, approaching the mining chamber from three separate doors. They enter.\n\nThe auxiliary light here is supposed to be red. But it's blue. The air is filled with ash-like black and blue glowing firefly-like particles. These particles are moving as if there's an air current. There isn't, which is unusual; on board ships or stations like this, there are typically constant light breezes due to air circulation systems. These are simply moving on their own.\n\nOur heroes see the creature. Hanging from the ceiling. It has the tall, thin build of a Belter; the build of the original test subject. It's covered in thick, shiny black plates of some kind, with the appearance of some sort of organic armor. Blue lights shine from its face and chest.\n\nIt sees its visitors and drops from the ceiling, crouching motionlessly next to the shallow mineshaft. Nothing happens. A few long, tense moments pass. Finally, one of Leontyne's researchers, unexperienced in any sort of conflict, panics and fires his weapon at the thing.\n\nBullets strike the creature. Sprays of black, filamentous 'blood' spread out behind it. The creature barely seems to notice physically, but it's enraged by the attack. With motions so quick as to be scarcely visible, it tears the researchers apart. Leontyne flees back to the labs where Sam and Valorie are waiting. Rozie sees him go, and in her distrust, she falls back to keep an eye on him.\n\nThe creature approaches Antonio, Donny, and John, seemingly without aggression. It stares at them. John tries to speak to it, but gets no response. From back in the lab, Sam can see that some kind of strange, static radiation emits from the creature, but it neither seems to care nor understand when it's spoken to.\n\nDonny, surmising that this behavior doesn't bode well for them, injects adrenaline into himself from his cybernetic systems, focusing him enough that he's capable of making an incredibly accurate shot. He fires. His bullet strikes the creature in the throat. Shining black blood sprays back over the room an mesmerizing pattern. The blue lights in its face and chest turn red, and it lets out a blood-curdling scream.\n\nWithout a moment's hesitation, John empties the makeshift flamethrower's fuel tank at the monster. It melts with a horrible sound into a puddle of strange black matter.\n\nThe auxiliary lights begin to shine the red they're meant to. Blue and black ash-like Particles drop out of the air and fizzle into darkness.\n\nJohn steps into the shallow mine at the center of the room, where he finds strange-looking debris. He puts a single intact blue crystal of some kind into his pocket, suspecting that it may be valuable. The three men return to the lab, where they confront Leontyne.\n\nWhat kind of experiments led to this horror?\n\nBio-matter from the mine, he explained, had been allowed to self-replicate slowly, and then administered to human test subjects in various ways. Topical application, injection, muscle layering, swallowed in pill form, etc. Every single test subject died horribly. All except one. The project lead's records had been destroyed, so Leontyne didn't know which method had ultimately led to a result, but that one had... changed. Mutated.\n\nAntonio asks how many volunteers had died along the way. Leontyne laughs and explains that there had never BEEN any volunteers. Prisoners bought from crooked wardens, the homeless, the elderly. People whose absences wouldn't be noted or lamented. THESE had been the test subjects. They'd never consented to anything. They'd just been shipped in and experimented on. Leontyne justifies this by claiming that the bio-matter represented the potential for the next stage of human evolution.\n\n\"Our race has been biologically stagnant for hundreds of years, maybe even thousands. We haven't changed, we haven't adapted. We've BUILT instead, but that's no substitute for true advancement. With this, we can specialize, we can make people into the perfect organisms for whatever problems they face. We haven't perfected it yet, but imagine a soldier that can ignore bullets the way that thing did! Imagine an engineer with eight limbs, that doesn't have to sleep, with a mental framework augmented by the bio-matter. It can solve problems faster, it can build solutions more efficiently. Imagine the possibilities. This... THIS... This is the road to human progress. This is the link bridging our reticence. This is the way we become our ultimate selves.\"\n\nOur heroes are taken aback. Some of them almost begin to believe him. He's taking a breath to continue his sales pitch when Rozie shoots him squarely between the eyes. Brains splash onto the wall behind him. His lips twitch wordlessly a few times. Blood trickles down either side of his nose. His eyes go dark, and he slumps to the ground lifelessly.\n\n\"Look at what he created. Look at what he did to people. He was a dangerous man with dangerous ideals.\"\n\nOur heroes mostly agree with her, though they're shaken by the weight of all they've witnessed, and unnerved by the fact that they've just seen her kill a man without remorse.\n\nThey collect as much data and safe-to-handle materials as they can. Sam discovers records on the computers indicating that Antonio had been framed for the attack on Mars, and that the chemical used had been based on this bio-matter. This solidifies the beginnings of trust in her mind, but when she mentioned it to Antonio, it only troubles him. The only person he knows who inhaled any of that material who had any chance of surviving was Zavier Koury, Prime Minister of Martian Parliament.\n\nThey find to ships registered in the docking bat. Large, sleek-looking, black-painted, beautiful ships with an unfamiliar design.\n\nRozie and Antonio speak briefly, airing their suspicions that Nintai (and in turn, Rozie's father) must have had something to do with the attack on Mars. Rozie broadcasts a message to the solar system, professing Antonio's innocence and condemning her father. Then she bids our heroes farewell, takes one of the ships, and flies off alone into the black. Our crew boards the other, identical vessel. They look around briefly.\n\nAn incoming transmission calls them all to the comms room. Out of curiosity, they go and answer the call. They're met with the image of Daneel Turing, CEO of Venn Orbital Limited, a large corporation. None of our heroes recognize him... except for Sam. She's been in contact with him before. He knows who she is. When he contacted her, hoping to employ her services, he'd mentioned things that she knew meant he was aware of her true identity. In response, she went digging for dirt on him in case he intended to blackmail her.\n\nWhat she found was strange indeed... Daneel Turing didn't exist.\n\nOr at least he hadn't. Not until four years ago.\n\nThere was no record of the man. He came into being almost at the same time as his company. All of his documents were impressively backdated, but simply absent from earlier scans and databases. When Venn Orbital Limited was founded, so appeared Daneel Turing, seemingly from thin air.\n\nSam's clever. She's found some sources indicating that Turing's documents were forged. But she still can't find who he is, or where he came from before. Whoever he is, 'Daneel Turing'... is a constructed identity.\n\nRegardless of all that, the truth is that Turing never had any intentions of blackmailing her. He was simply impressed by her abilities and wanted her in his stable.\n\nThe rest of our heroes know nothing about him. Whoever and wherever he may be, though, he seems to be able to communicate without lightspeed lag. His messages come in instantly, and the scenery and starfield in the background behind him indicates that he's not close enough for that to be reasonable. That means he's privy to tech the rest of the solar system would brutally kill for.\n\n\"Hello, my friends. The ship you're standing in, and the one our mutual friend Rozie just left in, were of my own design. They're prototype Venn Orbital ships. They were, in fact, stolen from our... private factories not long ago. But rest assured, I have no intention of blaming you. In fact, I don't want them back.\n\n\"I know your colleague Sam. And as such, I've been researching the rest of you for the last day or so. I think you're something special. You're free to keep the ship, but only on two conditions. First: you stay together. You have skills that are impressive individually, but together, you're uniquely suited to a wide range of challenges no single specialist could possibly handle. Second: while you're free to wander as you please, I reserve the right to hire you at any time and have you drop whatever you may be doing to take care of things for me. You will, of course, be paid handsomely in any such case; I have no intention of robbing you.\n\n\"I warn you now, what you've seen today... it was all nothing compared to what you'll see before long. The universe is changing, my friends; and you'll all be witness to the birth of the new one it's becoming. You'll all live to see everything that you think you know and believe changed before you.\n\n\"Sam: your roots are not what you believe them to be. You're in more danger than you think. Your instincts tell you it's not safe to trust anyone, and while there is some wisdom in that, it's even more dangerous to go alone. I promise you, these few people around you can be trusted. You've done a fine job staying hidden, but I've wiped your trail clean. It should keep the hounds away from you... at least for now.\n\n\"Antonio: Rozie planted the seeds of your innocence with her message. It was intercepted and blocked on Earth and Mars, but I circumvented their security and interrupted their evening news with a bit of, ah... let's call it pirate television, shall we? Still, you must be careful. The people who did this to you will not adjust their agendas, and I'm afraid these measures won't draw the heat off of you. The public has no evidence of your innocence beyond Rozie's word, and your pursuers won't hesitate to fabricate evidence of their own for... less altruistic reasons.\n\n\"John Calvor: I suspect you have... *glances meaningfully at Sam and Valorie*...reasons enough of your own to stay on with this crew, but in case you're in need of extra motivation, I'm hiring you on as a retainer, and assigning you as gunnery specialist aboard this ship. If you check your accounts, I believe you should find your first payment... suitable. Also, a warning: the Martian military is about to become much more hostile for you. Your enemies will try to buy your friends, and the ones who aren't for sale may be forced out or killed. Your enemies are running with dangerous people and playing with forces they don't understand.\n\n\"Valorie: this ship is very special. She's yours now, but I designed her myself. She'll fly faster, safer, and more agile than any vessel in space, matched only by the one I've given to Rozie. Your life is about to become... a bit complicated. But trust me when I say the only road to peace lies through the fire, and you're about to be leading the charge right through those flames. Take care of this ship. Take care of her crew. If you do, they'll take care of you in return.\"\n\n\"Donny: I'm sure you're excited to see what your new baby has under the hood, but I'd suggest you first head to the medbay. It's extremely advanced; probably the only place in the solar system capable of reconstructing the genetic damage you sustained absorbing the levels of radiation you did. Still, I don't suggest climbing into any more reactors, just the same. While you're there, you'll find a firmware update for your implants in the medbay computer. It should increase their efficiency in ways I think you'll appreciate, and it also includes a complete schematic of this ship. Take care of her.\"\n\nWith that, Turing nods and his face blinks out from the display.\n\nOur heroes fly into the black for a few moments. Donny finally speaks up, suggesting a name for their new home.\n\n\"I think we should call her the Reclamation.\"\n\nThe rest of the crew approves. They fly on in silence, out into the infinite night.\n\nWe've played a few more sessions since these first couple. Unfortunately, we live all over the place, so our games have been erratic. Still, the ongoing adventures of the crew of the Reclamation have continued! I might post more summaries in the future if people enjoy these.",

        "text": "Continued from Part 1: http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/38w9ei/grasp_the_sky_a_space_opera_adventure_adventure/\n\nOur heroes flee out into space. No time for real course-setting yet; they just have to get AWAY. A couple of hours pass. Everyone's too exhausted and too suspicious to get to know one another.\n\nThey push Valorie's ship too hard. WAY too hard. It was never meant for this kind of sustained high-intensity operation. The drive fails. Donny manages to rescue the engine from total, explosive catastrophic failure, but not without climbing all the way into the unshielded reactor, taking a very unhealthy dose of radiation for it, and he isn't able to repair it. They're unable to fly, floating free through nothingness.\n\nAfter an hour or two, they stumble across a small asteroid with some kind of facility built into it, with a small ship orbiting it in silence with all systems off to avoid being scanned. Before they know what's happened, they've been drawn in with a tractor beam and forcibly boarded.\n\nThis ship belongs to some pirates. They're in mid-mutiny, and their captain, Rozamond Kohara, is having command wrested from her by Edwin and his man-mountain second-in-command Thragg, a pair of members of her crew. She's pretending to accede her authority in hopes that the mutineers will allow her some room to maneuver. Our heroes are able to talk the mutineers into getting Donny to the medbay to treat his radiation poisoning. Med treatments along with injections of adrenaline from his own cybernetic implants get him back to consciousness; he's in working order, if a little woozy.\n\nA disagreement among the mutineers lead to them firing on our heroes, starting a fight. Rozie and Donny are in the medbay, while Antonio, John, Sam, and Valorie are in a cargo bay. Gunfire breaks out. The cargo bay heroes hide behind crates, while Rozie overturns a table in the medbay. She sheds her jacket, revealing extensive Yakuza tattoos over her arms and torso and a pair of Gun Fist Way pistols; specialized handguns designed for a martial art that focuses on both shooting and hand-to-hand combat.\n\nRozie and Donny quickly dispose of three mutineers and run for the cargo bay. Meanwhile, John, Antonio, and Valorie thin the crowd a bit with some careful shots and Sam hacks open a crate full of contraband weaponry. They nearly regain control of the situation, and Rozie arrives just in time to dispatch Edwin with EXTREME prejudice when Thragg shows up and hurls a crate across the cargo bay, nearly flattening our heroes.\n\nJohn finds a turret in the crate Sam hacked and begins setting it up. Donny fires a pistol shot at the giant, who barely notices it and charges at the engineer, picking up by his head and smashing him down... onto John's turret, destroying it. John tries to sneak behind Thragg to attack him from behind, but reinforcements arrive. Too many to handle.\n\nForced to concede in the face of overwhelming odds, our heroes are marched to midship. In light of Edwin's brutal death, a lieutenant claims the role of leader of the mutineers. He instructs his men to put Rozie on an escape pod with her belongings; afraid to kill her because of her father's power, and orders the rest of our heroes to be thrown into the airlock and dumped into open space. Rozie is launched away. Antonio attempts to reason with the leader of these rogues, but they don't care at all. Within minutes, our valiant heroes are floating in vacuum without suits.\n\nThey exhale to prevent their lungs from bursting. Ten seconds pass. Twenty. Thirty. Forty. Fifty. They only have a few moments left before they lose consciousness, suffer irreparable damage from vacuum exposure, and die. Fifty-nine seconds. The point of no return is about to click past.\n\nAt the last possible moment, Rozie swoops in, having gained direct control of her pod, and scoops them up. But they can't flee. The pod is far too short-range. The only place they can go is the uncharted base below.\n\nThey dock. While pressurizing, the others recognize Rozie's tattoos as the ornate irezumi of a high-ranking member of the Yakuza. Her father, Rurik Kohara, is the CEO of Nintai Solutions, a thinly-veiled front for the New Yakuza, headquartered on the asteroid Pallas. A few years earlier, organized crime in the solar system was a splintered mess; hundreds of tiny factions squabbling over territory. But when Rurik Kohara seized control, everything changed. He united nearly the entire criminal underworld into a single unit either by force, bribe, or leverage, resulting in a force so powerful that official governments have been forced to recognize its legitimacy and negotiate with it. Rozie worked for her father for much of her early life. She was overseeing a shipment of stolen goods before the end of the criminal wars when she and her team (assigned to her by her father) were attacked by a rival gang. Her people were wiped out, and she was held for ransom. Brutally tortured for days, leaving scars on her back which cut across her tattoos. She began to believe her father would never come for her. Ultimately, he did, and a few months passed. But her faith was broken, and she began to look into her father's affairs, and came to find that while he hadn't intended her to come to any harm, he'd always intended her to be bait to draw out his enemies. He viewed her torture as a hazard of a duty she'd never been told she was serving.\n\nIn response to this discovery, she cut herself off from her father, stole a ship, and fled the life she'd known, swearing to either wrest Nintai Solutions and its criminal underbelly from her father's hands... or to burn it all to the ground.\n\nThe station her ship had been orbiting was in fact a secret research station; one she had reason to believe was being funded by Nintai. She intended to raid it, strip it of resources that might be valuable to her father, and destroy it.\n\nAfter the rest of our heroes heard her story, they spend a moment trying to craft a plan of action, but are interrupted by the doors opening to an empty lobby, lit only with red emergency lights, indicating a fallback to the emergency power grid. They step into the room. A voice greets them over intercom and directs them. They follow its instructions and find themselves inside the ruins of a research lab, scientists in ragged, dirty clothes congregated along one wall. They're greeted by the overseer, a man incongruously decked out in full formal dress who calls himself Leontyne.\n\nLeontyne explains that they've walked into what he terms \"a bit of an inconvenience\"; one of their experimental subjects has gone wild. In the process, it knocked out the power to half the station and wiped out the entire military contingent stationed there for defense. Leontyne wheedles our heroes to assist his science team in solving this \"little problem\". They reluctantly agree, knowing they have no easy way off this small asteroid base on their own.\n\nThere's no power to life support through most of the station; the labs are one of the only places sealed off separately and pressurized. As such, Donny and John are forced to don atmosphere suits and walk over the top of the station to reach the secondary reactor and reactivate the power. Just before they go, Leontyne warns them that if they see blood anywhere, either the creature's or the soldiers it's killed, they must not touch it. They walk in uneasy silence, their magnetized boots holding them down. It takes nearly fifteen minutes to reach the opposite end. Halfway across, they pass a spot where the base's metal shell has been badly torn, and the gruesome, mutilated, faceless remains of a soldier who'd faced whatever it was lurking below floats slowly up from the damaged room. They reach their destination. Donny finds the station's schematics and uploads them into his cybernetics systems. They reactivate the cameras, but see no trace of whatever it is haunting the halls.\n\nSam switches the monitors to display output from the security cameras back at the labs, and while doing so, catches a glimpse of the Taos Corporation logo on the computers. Her family is involved in this somehow. How? She's not sure. She doesn't let on that she's gleaned this bit of knowledge, but is much more wary of Leontyne and his people now.\n\nShe manages to hack into the system and clear what will hopefully be a safe path of clean rooms and sealed doors for John and Donny to return through. They make their way halfway across the station to the locker rooms that had belonged to the military security unit that had been stationed here. They arm themselves and collect enough weapons for everyone else. But while they're doing so, the power drops out again.\n\nJohn and Donny now don't have enough air left in their suits to return. Someone from the original group has to make the journey. Rozie and John discuss it. Rozie doesn't trust Leontyne or his people, and given that she has more experience with combat, they decide that she should remain behind to protect the more vulnerable Sam and Valorie. So Antonio, a politician with no military experience or technical knowledge, nervously climbs into an atmo suit and stakes a slow, lonely, terrifying walk across the roof.\n\nHe breathes heavily and does everything in his power not to panic. SOMETHING is below him, and it's killed dozens of trained personnel. The only thing between him and open vacuum is a thin pressurized atmo suit and a couple of electromagnets. It's all he can do to keep from hyperventilating as he walks across the top of the station, passes the lazily drifting and horribly mutilated body of a man with years of training he never had, floating blank-faced through space, drifting slowly away to be lost forever to the emptiness.\n\nHe finally arrives at the other side. He descends into a maintenance shaft. He has no technical knowledge whatsoever. The only way he can be useful is by listening to Donny's instructions over the radio. Barely able to breathe for his fear, he begins to reconnect wires and go through the necessary processes Donny describes to re-establish power.\n\nFrom above, Antonio hears the hiss of an opening door, and the thump... thump... thump... of footsteps. Heavy, with the taps of claws. Not human footsteps. Something else. Something slower, something predatory. He freezes, not moving.\n\nThump.\n\nThump.\n\nThump.\n\nPause.\n\n\n\nThump.\n\nThump.\n\nThump.\n\nThe footsteps finally lead away, and the hiss of the door sounds again. Antonio realizes he's been subconsciously holding his breath. He gasps, draws in a few breaths, struggles to calm his desperate heartbeat. Donny walks him through the last few steps of reactivating the power.\n\nPressure returns. From somewhere in the base, all three of our errant heroes hear the sound of tearing metal. Sam sees on the security displays that one of the heavy-duty doors has been completely, roughly torn out of the wall it was held in.\n\nJohn and Donny, jumpy with what they've garnered from recent events, make their way back hastily to join with Antonio. They decide that even though pressure and atmosphere has returned, they'll be safest returning the way they came: over the top. They climb back into the airlock. Donny turns just in time to see several long, black talons piercing the door between them and the rest of the base. He urgently mentions it over the radio, and Sam tries to get a look on the security cameras, but all she sees is a few frames of frighteningly smooth and quick talons as the creature purposefully destroys the camera.\n\nThat confirms it. This thing is intelligent.\n\nJohn, Donny, and Antonio try to double-time across the roof. Halfway across, something hears the clanking of their footsteps. Talons shred through the metal mere inches from their feet, releasing a nearly-invisible puff of oxygen into space, but the metal proves too thick for the creature to quickly tear through, and they make it back to the labs, terrified but safe.\n\nAll our heroes want at this point is to leave. John tells Leontyne that only a military presence could handle whatever it was they were dealing with.\n\n\"Why, Mr. Calvor...\" Leontyne says, demonstrating knowledge that he shouldn't have of our heroes' origins and identities, \"You ARE a military presence, are you not?\"\n\nOur heroes are taken aback by Leontyne's knowledge of them. He begins to explain. This asteroid is a Jovian capture; sometime in the last couple of million years, it had come barreling through our solar system on a collision course with Earth, but it was caught (like so many others) in Jupiter's gravity well, which sent it careering into the asteroid belt. It ricocheted around a bit and finally settled in one place. A few years before the events of our story, it had been found by corporate mining surveyors.\n\nWherever it came from, artifacts were found inside. Something... alien. Much of it damaged by collisions with other space rocks, but some technology survived. And, incredibly, some living samples of some kind of biological matter were recovered.\n\nResearch began in earnest. Secret labs cropped up throughout the solar system, belonging to various companies, and they sent pieces of debris and the strange bio-matter between one another, trying to puzzle out just what it all was and what it meant.\n\nLeontyne's station had been especially secret; highly experimental. Most bio-matter test subjects simply died.\n\nOne survived.\n\nDestroyed its entire lab. Killed the project lead that had been studying it. That was the one that was stalking around the ruins of this station right now.\n\nBy now, Sam is able to determine from systems readouts that the thing had holed up in the central chamber of the base. A large room with a hole in the middle; the area where all of this alien stuff had been mined out in the first place. But she can't see into it. The creature has intentionally cut off security cameras and power to its room, so nothing can look in on it.\n\nLeontyne notes that the creature disliked extreme high temperatures. Our heroes manage to MacGyver a sort of crude flamethrower out of the labs few Bunsen burners and their fuel sources.",

        "text": "Our universe is based heavily on The Expanse. James S. A. Corey is the pen name used for space opera collaborations between Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck, who are friends/assistants to George R. R. Martin. If you haven't read the series, I strongly recommend picking up Leviathan's Wake. If you read this, I lifted some plot ideas and imagery straight from that series (my players haven't read them, and there's that whole \"good artists copy, great artists steal\" thing, haha). There will be quasi-spoilers for The Expanse in here.\n\nOur plot is a hodgepodge; as GM, I've just duct-taped everything I love about various space operas into our setting; stuff from Leviathan Wakes, elements of Farscape and Firefly, touches from Neal Stephenson novels, whatever else I may be reading/watching, and my own ideas. We're playing FATE Core with some slight system adjustments to accommodate our universe. The following is setup, paraphrasing bridge plot I wrote based on my players' seed ideas to bring our heroes together after the character creation session.\n\nOur story takes place in the mid-30th century. Mankind has colonized our solar system. We're just beginning to create the technology necessary to reach beyond. Travel is still slow; no FTL, so it takes days or weeks to months to cross the distances between Earth (controlled by the UN) to Mars (independent government just becoming strong enough to start getting uncomfortably expansionist), to asteroid belt colonies and the Jupiter system (still the Wild West of the solar system). Humans have physiological differences based on the amount of gravity they grew up with. Earthers; Martians and Belters/Spacers who are thinner and taller due to gravity differences.\n\nOur heroes: Antonio Berni, UN diplomat from Earth with Paraguayan mestizo heritage, 'Sam' Taos, brilliant hacker and runaway corporate princess of a wealthy Earth family, John V. Calvor, ex-Special Forces Martian Marines sniper (dishonorably discharged) turned mercenary, Donny Jacobson, Earther mechanic/boxer who's been secretly stealing parts from his employers to build himself a ship, Valorie Rose, shy Earther racing pilot who's spent her adult life in space on racing circuits, and Rozie Kohara, Belter; wayward and estranged daughter of Rurik Kohara, kumicho of the Palladian Yakuza, possibly the largest and most successful organized crime syndicate in existence, determined to dismantle her father's legacy after he endangered and used her for his own means. I'd intended Rozie to be a recurring NPC, but she's become my GMPC since the player running Valorie dropped out after our second session.\n\nAntonio is a prodigy. Now in his early-mid 20s, recruited by the UN Foreign Service at just 18. Distinguished himself over the intervening years enough to earn the honor of becoming the youngest intersolar envoy in the organization's history. Sort of a golden boy of Earther politics, an incredibly talented and insightful politician. Not beloved among the more conservative wings of the UN government; some of the extremists want war, and Antonio has always stood for peace. Currently on a prestige mission to Mars, renegotiating the peace accords between UN and Martian governments. An important task, but a bit of a gimme; no one expects negotiations to go poorly. The UN and Martian governments are on good terms, though they still try to take advantage of one another.\n\nBetween intense sessions of carefully-worded negotiations, he got a call from a colleague back on Earth. Evelyn Truscott, Australian representative to the UN. A good friend. One of the only people he worked with that he'd trust without question.\n\n\"Tony, you have to leave. NOW. You can't finish negotiations. Someone's making a move. There's going to be a chemical attack on the Martian capitol dome.\"\n\nMars hasn't been completely terraformed yet; as such, its people still live primarily in a network of atmosphere domes.\n\n\"Not sure when... but soon. Very soon. Maybe less than an hour from when I'm sending this message. Not sure who ordered it. Not Bautista; even he's not that bold. But he knows it's coming, and he intends to use it. He wants you out of his way. He's arranged for you to be there when it happens. Can't tell you my sources, but trust me, they're reliable. If this happens and you're in the middle of it... Please, Tony, just get the hell away.\"\n\nTony has a million thoughts. One stands out.\n\nLag.\n\nEarth is about twenty light-minutes away from Mars right now. That makes this warning twenty minutes old. And twenty minutes too late.\n\nHe throws open the door to the boardroom where he's been negotiating, shouting that they have to evacuate. Shows the message. Martian negotiators aren't sure it's not just a play, but they don't ignore this kind of threat. They start moving politicians to safety, supplying emergency gas masks. Antonio sends one to evacuate the Parliament itself, currently in a meeting. They're almost in time.\n\nVents burst above them, spraying a thick, toxic fog. They struggle not to panic, hold their breath, grab gas masks. Guards escort diplomats to safety. They're mostly too late. Everywhere Antonio runs, he finds bodies. Staff. Innocent people who'd come into work not knowing what awaited them. People who'd traveled with him from Earth.\n\nHe tries not to be sick. No time for that now. Right now, maybe he can still help some of them. He runs through offices, holding air in his lungs. Dead everywhere. He makes his way to the office of the Prime Minister of the Martian Parliamentary Republic, Zavier Koury. Nothing appears to be wrong here, but he rushes past a frantic secretary. Just in time to see fog pour in through the vents. He tries to press his own gas mask to the PM's face. Koury is already unconscious. Antonio drags Koury out, lungs burning as his single gasp of air runs out, tripping over bodies. There's the secretary he passed on the way in, glassy-eyed and pale. There's the guard he sent to evacuate Parliament, who never reached his goal. Antonio's vision starts to fade as lack of oxygen and screaming lungs start to win. He bursts through doors between domes, feels them closed against his back, feels the moment of vacuum as they vent into Mars' thin atmosphere and repressurize. He gasps desperately just as the doors opposite him open. Martian soldiers burst through. They see this Earther standing over their unconscious Prime Minister. they raise their weapons.\n\nAntonio desperately hits the emergency lock button. Doors slam shut. He leaves his gas mask strapped onto the PM's face... and runs back into the gas. There must be another way out.\n\nHe finds his way out, but he's still lost. He wanders the domes, fleeing every time he sees soldiers running to the capitol dome.\n\nFinally, he reached the base of the orbital lift, where a space elevator can carry passengers to and from the spaceports in orbit and their docked ships. No soldiers posted here; they must not know he's escaped the capitol dome. The lift doors open.\n\nSix guards exit, dragging a big, bearded Earther in restraints. Donny Jacobson. He smashes an elbow into one of his guards' faces. Gets a punch to the stomach in answer. While he's doubled over, his guards notice Antonio staring at them open-mouthed. They radio that they've found the fugitive they heard about on their way in and bolt for Antonio. He grabs a wrench and starts hitting people.\n\nDonny joins in once he realizes what's happening. Together, they take down the guards. After a brief conversation, just enough to determine that Donny's not a monster (in fact, he was arrested for stealing parts from his employers to build his own ship), Antonio smashes his cuffs. They run to the nearest orbital lift in hopes of escaping. No good; it's locked down. They're just considering running when a 17-year old girl steps onto their lift. She won't answer when they ask who she is, but she rapidly hacks the systems to activate the lift.\n\n'Sam' Taos wants out. She hasn't done anything SPECIFICALLY wrong, but she knows bad things are happening, and she doesn't want to be recognized. Her family has people looking for her, with significant bounties; she prefers to keep a low profile. She keeps a close eye on Antonio and Donny as the lift carries them into orbit.\n\nShe tries to walk away from them at the top, toward a boarding umbilical, but Antonio catches her arm.\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"My own way.\"\n\n\"Can you fly that ship?\"\n\nShe hesitates. That's all he needs to know.\n\n\"I didn't think so. Listen, even if you know what's going on down there, even if they don't know you helped me... us... the ships docked here aren't going anywhere. The Martians are very, very angry with me right now. This shipyard is locked down. Nothing leaves. You get on that ship, even if you hack security magnets holding it in place and fly it out of here, they're going to fire on you. If you don't know what you're doing, you're slag before you fly a kilometer. You stay here, they know somebody hacked the lifts to get us up here, and that makes you an accomplice.\"\n\n\"So what, I come with you so there's no question that I was your accomplice?\"\n\n\"I was thinking maybe you come with us, we get you wherever you're going, we don't ask each other too many questions, we drop you off, and I... I don't have to be responsible for any...  any MORE corpses today.\"\n\n\"...Fine. Lead the way.\"\n\nThey make their way down the docking bays. They find Antonio's ship, the *UNS Armistice*. Ambassador-class diplomatic vessel from Earth. Not Antonio's command, but at least his home. She's carried him to every foreign-soil negotiation he's ever attended, and before that he interned aboard her.\n\nWalking into her airlock, he starts to relax for the first time since all this started. He'd get out. He couldn't undo all the tragedies he's witnessed, but he's going to put it all right. Clear his name.\n\nThe doors open. He smells the copper tang of blood on the air. All that tension comes back with a healthy dose of dread.\n\nEveryone on board has been slaughtered. They stare in horror at the bodies for a moment, let the automatic airlock doors close again in front of them.\n\nIn this moment he knows that Evelyn was wrong. Bautista was bolder than she thought. He didn't just want Antonio to be there for this disaster; he wanted to pin it all on him.\n\nSam swallows. \"We're not flying in there. Not with all those... all those bodies.\"\n\nAntonio shakes his head. \"No, we're not. One of them is sure to be our pilot. Even if he was alive, this is too thorough of a hit. Bautista wouldn't count on me being too disturbed to fly.\"\n\nDonny nods. \"You go into that engine room, you'll find a reactor leak, maybe a cracked drive core. Or a bomb, depending on how subtle this guy who wants you dead is.\"\n\nThey step back out into the docking bays. How will they escape? Steal a ship, maybe, Donny suggests.\n\nThey walk almost all the way back down the bay when they notice someone working on a ship. A tiny racer with no markings. She has grease on her face, holding a small welding torch.\n\nValorie Rose has had a bad few days. Her ship will fly, but it has a decel problem. Makes it annoying to stop. She's been flying people in to Mars on the downlow. Technically not legal, but she's careful enough. Things have gotten messy. She's gotten blamed for some things happening on the surface. She's being held here on those suspicions, though they don't have anything on her, and she's been here a few days.\n\nDonny's a mechanic; he sees her working and jumps right in. \"Will she fly?\"\n\n\"Sure; she's just a bit sluggish incoming. Why? Who are you?\"\n\n\"Donny Jacobson.\" He offers a hand; she takes it uncertainly.\n\n\"Valorie Rose.\"\n\n\"Nice to meet you, Val. Listen, I'll be straight with you; we're, uh, we're in a little trouble. This lockdown belongs to us, in fact. Has anybody here seen you?\"\n\nShe shakes her head.\n\n\"Good. Great, in fact. Now listen, I'm willing to bet your decel problem has something to do with stabilizer calibrations. Whatever it is, I can fix it for you, I guarantee it, but I need you to give us a lift away from Mars.\"\n\nShe nods. \"I can do that. Well, COULD do that. But I'm locked in like everybody else.\"\n\nAntonio turns to Sam. \"Think you can hack that?\"\n\nSam bites her lip. \"I can... but not fast. They were throwing every defense they had at me on that lift. Getting back into the system now would be tough. You'd probably be able to cut those magnet arms before I'd be able to release them.\"\n\nDonny shushes everyone as he notices motion at the entrance. \"Company!\"\n\nA security team steps out of the lift. Our heroes scramble to hide behind crates and equipment as the security officers start to walk in their direction.\n\nA tall martian in marine armor steps out of the shadows into their way.\n\n\"Oh, so you DO exist after all! I was beginning to think no one was listening to my hails.\"\n\nThe guards look at each other, and then at the marine, confused.\n\n\"Uh... what?\"\n\n\"Oh, for--Fine, let's just start again, shall we? I'm John Calvor.\" He produces a credential chip and waves it at them irritably. \"Marine Special Forces, tracking the fugitives on special orders from the deputy Prime Minister. We followed them in here, but they cut their way free and left this port on a LADAR-dark ship about six minutes ago. My special ops team commandeered the ship in bay 1138 to pursue, and if we'd had clearance when we ASKED for it, we'd have them back in custody already. Instead, YOU are about to be responsible for their escape, do you understand? We're on their tail as soon as you release the locks on this port. What the hell are you waiting for!?\"\n\nThe lead guard swallows, scans the credential chip. His scanner blinks green. John breathes a quiet sigh of relief; his creds were supposed to be cancelled when he was discharged, but he has a few friends left, altering systems. The guard locks into a stiff salute.\n\n\"So sorry, Commander Calvor. We'll release the locks immediately.\"\n\nThey run to a control station. John waits for them, then walks to Antonio.\n\n\"All right,\" he says under his breath, \"I was just your ticket off this rock; I think that's worth a ticket of my own.\"\n\nAntonio looks at him suspiciously. \"Why would you help us?\"\n\nCalvor shrugs; holds up his chip. \"They really ought to be more thorough about taking this thing out of the system. Only came back to Mars to tie up some loose ends. Now I should really be going, and I like the look of your...\"\n\nHe eyes Valorie lasciviously. \"...ship.\"\n\nAntonio rolls his eyes, but thinks about it. \"Well, unless anyone else objects, I'd say you're welcome... you probably just saved our skins.\"\n\nThe others nod. Valorie waves them into the ship and runs to the cockpit. The others make their way to the passenger area and engine deck. Valorie's ship is tiny and cramped; clearly made for single-pilot racing and not for hauling people. They strap in. Lift free from the docking arms. Accelerate forward. Out into the black.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/38v7yn/nights_black_agents_taking_the_vampire_with_you/",
        "text": "For the vast majority of you who aren't familiar with it, Night's Black Agents is a game that can best be described as Burn Notice, if Michael Weston discovered in the pilot episode that he had been working for literal vampires all along. Anyway, my group decided to give it a shot because it sounded fun, expecting it to be a short campaign. We were not wrong; mortal espionage-types against literal vampires in command of other mortal espionage-types is an inequitable match-up at the best of times.\n\nThe campaign had progressed to the point that we felt we needed to snatch a vampire directly, both to gather intelligence and as a source of leverage to make them stop threatening family-members of PCs. We'd tracked the one absolutely-known vampire down to a hotel in Berlin, and moved in to bag him. Half the team (three members) went up in cleaning uniforms as the bag team while the remainder (myself included) stayed parked nearby in a stolen ambulance wearing EMT uniforms as the extraction team. Everything went smoothly at first. I stress those last two words: at first.\n\nThe bag-team made their way into the hotel unnoticed, got up to the floor unnoticed, found the vampire's room unnoticed, snuck into it unnoticed with the vampire asleep on one of the hotel beds. Now, at this point I should detail something else about the system: there are a shitload of different kinds of vampires, and the players have no more idea of what the actual vampires they're dealing with are capable of than the characters do. We knew these ones were fucking strong, really fucking perceptive, had vicious, nasty claws, drank blood, disliked bullets to some degree, and didn't give any fucks about artificial UV light. Beyond that...who knows?\n\nSo the bag team gets set up around the vampire. Ron's ready with a sharpened stake, because we hadn't tried those yet. Danny is ready at the curtains, because it's daytime and we also hadn't tried actual sunlight yet, and Freddy has a homemade flamethrower at the ready, made from a heavily-modified water pistol. Fire seemed a safe bet under most circumstances.\n\nSo we opened with the stake. The vampire's hands were folded over his chest, so the shot was awkward at best, and nobody was worth a damn with melee weapons, so Ron flubbed the roll and just sort of...didn't accomplish much. We'd also established that these fuckers were pretty tough, and he just didn't penetrate much at all. He did, however, wake the vampire up, and it proceeded to start clawing at Ron. Danny yanked the curtains open -- sunlight did fuck-all. The three of them started weaving between staking attempts and flamethrower attacks, somehow miraculously not lighting each other on fire through vastly lucky rolls, and Oren hit the panic button. The extraction team started to roll in, knowing some shit was going down, but without details as to what.\n\nBy the time we arrived at the hotel, the fire alarms had gone off and people were evacuating. That was nice, both because it meant that nobody was surprised at emergency services showing up and because evacuation procedures are built around keeping elevators clear for emergency personnel to use. We took the elevator up to the floor with the vampire, and...ding, it opened. Into...aw shit.\n\nWe were treated to the sight of a hallway full of several things. One, screaming civilians. Two, gunmen, specifically the vampire's private bodyguards. Three, two of our three comrades (Danny was already dead, shot in the head in one of the rooms). And four, the OTHER vampire we hadn't known about. Oh, and five and six, smoke and bullets.\n\nWe start laying down covering fire from the open elevator, sheltering to either side of the doorway. It became clear quickly that our guys weren't going to make it out under their own power, largely because they were gunned down before our eyes. Couldn't tell if they were dead or just too injured to move, but in either case, well...they needed help. My character was a serious hand-to-hand badass, more a wrestler than a boxer or a martial artist, and I had an idea.\n\nQuentin (yours truly) yelled for the Doc to shoot out the window in one of the open hotel rooms nearby, and then took off running at the vampire. Oren starts to cover me from the gunmen by herding civilians into their line of fire with his flamethrowers. The Doc did what he was told, ran over to the open doorway and shot the floor-to-ceiling window, put a couple of holes in it and put about a million little cracks in the pane. And Quentin went for the grapple. Now, his original plan was to hurl the vampire out the window, but as he was wrestling with the vampire, several things occurred. \n\nHis backup started getting shot to hell, the vampire started struggling like crazy, and he realized that it's a lot easier to take someone with you out the window than it is to try to throw them through it while stopping yourself. The way his team was getting shot apart, if he didn't do something drastic, they were all going to die.\n\nSo Quentin just charged the window, vampire in hand, and went right through the glass. Of a seventh-story hotel room. Now, we still didn't have a feel for how tough these things were, so I made one last hand-to-hand roll to keep hold of the vampire on the way down, and rolled perfect. And that's the story of how Quentin Bardasano died piledriving a vampire into a Berlin city street from seven stories up while the Doc set off a suicide vest,  killed absolutely everyone else left behind on all sides and providing a huge explosion for Quentin's dive to silhouette against.\n\nNobody lived, but at least the bloody vampires died.",

        "text": "Sent here from the recent [Askreddit question](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/38q5oy/dd_players_of_reddit_what_is_the_biggest_mistake/), and I figured I would share with you guys too. The first campaign is still happening, the rest are just tidbits that I remember.\n\n**System** - Pathfinder for all\n\n**Character** - Dora the Destroyer, then Ti'Ana\n\n**Race and Class** - Halfling Barbarian, then a Human Arcanist\n\n**Level** - Created at lvl 1 Mythic tier 10. Dora died at lvl 10 Mythic tier 10. Ti'Ana was then made at 10/10. (Mythic tiers are essentially huge rewards/extra levels for being recognized by the gods).\n\n**Other characters** - Half-elf Ninja, Half-elf Paladin, Dwarf Cleric\n\nThis campaign was all about being really overpowered at a low level. We were taken from our respective worlds and given all the power we could want by a deity. He had been cut off from the world and needed people to restore his power. We come into the world and hear about a couple of bad guys that are causing havoc. Of course, we go and defeat them.\n\nAfter the major battle (where I killed at least 100 goblins on my own), we expected to return home. No dice, we didn't actually free the god. However, there was now a town that loved us. Some of us let that power go to our heads.\n\nWe found a tent that teleported you to a castle. There were inhabitants. We killed all but one, who we then hired to maintain the castle. The dwarf started a cult, then a religion. He basically controlled all of the crafters in the city. I set up a royal guard to protect him. The ninja trained ninjas that got rid of whoever was in our way. The paladin started churches that hopefully would give the god strength.\n\nAnother army came to attack the city. There was a magic circle with five priests. I hit two of them. The circle broke with a bang and I walked it off to kill the lead priest. Later we came across a lich doing a ritual. The lich was able to hold me down with his mind. I did not like that one bit. The party defeated him and he started reforming instantly. The paladin said his home must be in the circle. So I took the dwarf's divine hammer and destroyed the circle. I killed me, the four hostages, and knocked the paladin unconscious.\n\nThe ninja returned home with the paladin. The dwarf stayed looking for his hammer. The ninja convinced the paladin that the dwarf was dead. The dwarf's player decided he wanted to drop the campaign. Long live the dwarf king. Luckily my new character could make any item, so she filled the void.\n\nWe were then sent to rescue a goddess. We defeated the (immortal) champion guarding her and tried to bring her back home. She said she was too weak. So she gave us the last of her power. Five levels for everyone. We offered to sit with her until she faded (which took five days). While the paladin held her hand, my character questioned her about everything. I now have knowledge on how to become a goddess.\n\n**Character** - Ahrli\n\n**Race/Class** - Kitsune Bard\n\n**Level** - Between 6-8\n\n**Other Characters** - Dwarf Cleric, Elven Ranger, Half-Orc Barbarian\n\nOOC, the party was discussing if we got xp last session. The DM was consulting his notes and the barbarian said \"I am taking 20,000 xp\". We didn't stop him.\n\nThat session, the barbarian failed a saving throw. We had recently picked up an artifact, and it wanted to manipulate him. He was shown a vision with two guards, a king, and a queen sleeping. Each had keys around their necks and behind them was a door with four locks. He was told that there would be endless power behind the door.\n\nHe tried sneaking up on a guard and woke him up. When the guard tried to defend himself, he beheaded him and took the key. He went on and hit the king enough for him to go down. The second guard and the queen were awake now. He roared and caused the second guard to flee (in the vision he dropped the key). The queen resisted and simply said \"Your reality is not real.\" He got to reroll the saving throw. Failed again.\n\nThe queen repeated \"Otto! Wake up!\" He passed his throw this time. We then had to deal with a dead ranger (revived), a mostly dead cleric and a magus (with access to dimension door) who was compelled to flee as far and as fast as possible.\n\nMy bard used a suggestion spell to save the party. It was awesome.\n\n**Character** - Lilia\n\n**Race/Class** - Halfling Oracle\n\n**Level** - Around 5\n\n**Other Characters** - Don't even remember everyone\n\nThere are five of us. Three of us fall down into a spike pit trap. Two are fine, one is at exactly 0 hp. Unconscious, not dead. One of the two on the surface drops down a rope, I tie myself onto it, and she lifts me up half way. I then cast levitate on the unconscious party member and lift him to the top of the pit. Due to the rules of the spell, I can only move him up and down. He is a few feet above the pit near the edge. The gnome tries to grab him to pull him over. He misses (like, a 5).\n\nPart of playing the Oracle is a curse. My curse was that there was a spirit following me that would randomly mess with things around me. At that moment, the DM decided the spirit should mess with the knots on the rope. As I am falling, I yell \"GRAB HIM!\" and maintain the spell. The person that was holding the rope tries to grab him. Rolls a 1. Falls down the pit.\n\nI hit the bottom of the pit and loose my concentration (and hit the range of the spell). The unconscious character drops. And dies. It was an NPC character that was supposed to die, but the DM did let us try and save him.\n\nAnd one last one.\n\nI had a socially awkward friend that I got into Pathfinder. We were playing with some close friends when the DM decided to test her a little bit. He introduces a character that starts flirting with her (though not in a creepy way). As a player, she mostly understands what is happening. The character was buying her gifts and bringing her to dinners, etc.\n\nHowever, this character had issues with social cues and had no clue. So we got one of my favorite quotes out of her.\n\n\"Another gift? I DON'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THIS!!!\"",

        "text": "(Link to Part 1 http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/38naed/gather_round_young_children_and_let_old_grandpa/)\n\nSomething that wasn't mentioned in part 1, but is very important, the party found a parcel full of strings that were embedded with magic on Lucas's body. Each string was about 4 ft long\n\nSo when we last left our heroes, Dandi had been accused of starting a fire that had burned down an entire village because Dandi was a wizard and had the ability to do so. We know that Dandi didn't do it because Dandi was in prison at the time. So now the group of adventurers had to clear Dandi's name. \n\nAfter leaving the cave where they left Lucas and his warhammer Mitchell, they came to a sign that had an arrow pointing down a path that read \"Donlia.\" They discovered that Donlia was a village and decided to pay them a visit. . Sunshine, at this point, left the party to go on a hunting trip, not to be seen for several days. Now that they were on the path to Donlia, Sunshine returns to the group, looking rather ragged and worn out. It looked like she had been attacked, but she couldn't really give an explanation as to why she looked the way that she did. The party paid it no mind and decided to go on to Donlia. So after they got about halfway to the village, they came across what appeared to be an abandoned shack. They went ahead and investigated, thinking that there might be some loot that they could pillage out of this shack. When the party walked in, the building burst into flames. The party ran outside and on top of the house was the devil like creature that appeared to them in front of the prison. He laughed and then disappeared in a wall of flames. The party high tailed it to Donlia. \n\nOnce in Donlia, they found out that the city was starving. They were relying on the crops that the prison was growing as a food supply. The inn was only accepting food in place of gold for payment. Not having any food, the party had a fair amount of gold, so they decided to go to the local bakery. Inside the bakery, they found an old wizard who wasn't selling bread, but magical items. Sophie decided to strike out on her own. Falloran and Dandi decided to shop around and see what magical items the guy had. So Dandi decided to buy one of the potions that he had on sale. She took it outside and opened it up. An ethereal light began to glow from the bottle and out popped a solid white mongoose. Falloran and Sophie promptly called it a sock rat. Dandi called it Dede. (Pronounced DayDay.) So our party of Sunshine, Falloran, Sophie, Dande, and Dede the sock rat decided to go to the local pub for a drink. When they walked in a friendly voice said \"Welcome to Reggie's Pub! REEEEEEGGGGGIEEEEEE!\" Reggie Pub. Can I get you something to drink?\" The party felt welcomed by Reggie and decided to take him up on his offer. The group's first drink was on the house. They talked to Reggie and found out that the demon that had been causing all the fires was called the Sabot and there was a bounty on his head. They should talk to the mayor. While Reggie, Sunshine, Falloran, and Dandi talked to Reggie, Sophie walked over and sat next to a woman who was hooded and cloaked and had a private conversation with her. The woman, Falloran recognized as an elf, got up to leave and Sophie came back to join them. As she walked by, Falloran said in elfish \"So what's your story?\" In return, also in elfish, the woman replied \"Speak to me again, and I will cut out your tongue.\" So Falloran let her be. The party then decided to go pay a visit to the local blacksmith. They came across a dwarf there who went by the name of Brakeules Irongut, but everyone called him Brake. Brake and Dandi hit it off pretty well and Brake gave Dandi a spell that would allow Brake to be called to the party in a time of need. Sophie had in her possession a helmet that rendered the user blind, which she sold to Brake for 200 gold. After striking that deal, the party went to visit the Mayor of Donlia to see about this bounty for the Sabot. The mayor immediately knew who Dandi was and said that if they were to bring the Sabot to him, dead or alive, he would petition the King to have Dandi pardoned. The party took him up on his offer and went to the old mine shaft where the Sabot lived. They had several encounters in the mines, and at one point, in a fight against some looters, Sunshine got very angry. VERY ANGRY! She began to glow and sprout fur all over her body. Her teeth and nose elongated and she grew a bushy tail. She now stood at about 15 ft tall. The party panicked. Sunshine was a werewolf. They didn't know exactly what to do after Sunshine destroyed a group of looters all by herself. Falloran and Sophie were ready to fight, but it was Dandi who came up with the solution. They fed her some raw meat that they had saved from a previous camp. Sunshine turned back into her normal bubbly self. Falloran and Sophie were quite upset that she hadn't made the party aware of this ability. Sunshine then explained that while she was hunting, she was attacked by a werewolf and discovered that upon becoming angry, she turned into a werewolf. The party now became really wary of Sunshine. So the party then adventured on into the lair of the Sabot. They discovered that each of the strings from earlier had a different magical property when they were used to choke someone. One in particular, a blue one, encased the user in water and immobilized them. They made it to the chamber with the Sabot and he immediately informed the party that he could easily decimate them all. Falloran charged, knowing that this was a demon and hating all things that were evil. They couldn't land a blow on him. Falloran finally decided to try the blue string. Sunshine went wolf and distracted him from the front while Falloran choked him from behind with the blue string. They now had the Sabot captured. \"Cool,\" said Falloran, \"Now how do we get him back?\" Sunshine had the answer. She had the ability to walk on water, so the seven foot half-orc werewolf climbed on top of the sphere of water and walked it back to town like a lumberjack on a log on the river. The party took him back to the mayor, who said he would make the arrangements to have Dandi pardoned. Then he started to act really strange. He wouldn't tell the party why he wanted the Sabot to stay in town. It made Falloran think that he would use the Sabot as leverage to line his own pockets with the townsfolk's money. Then Falloran heard a voice in his head. \"I used to be an angel once, release me and I will help you take on this wicked man.\" It was the voice of the Sabot. Falloran believed the Sabot and ran forward and grabbed the blue string that was holding the Sabot in place. The water disappeared and everyone looked horrified, except the party. (Later, Falloran found out that the Sabot had communicated with each party member with something that was in line with their interests, trying to free itself.) The Sabot fell to the ground, rose up and looked at Falloran. \"Thank you. You fool!\" The Sabot then proceeded to wreak havoc upon the town, burning Donlia to the ground. The party had just enough time to escape to the outskirts with their lives.",

        "text": "Good day, /r/gametales! It's been quite some time, hasn't it? The Shirt Bandits are back and causing more trouble than ever.\n\n* The Furbag: The sole Wookiee on the crew. Thoughtful, kindhearted, introspective, and well-learned. He's the team muscle when he has to be (though not as much as you might expect from a Wookiee), he's basically the closest thing to a moral center and mitigating influence that the group has. This would matter a lot more if anyone else on the crew besides the Killbot actually understood the Wookiee language. Fights with a vibro axe.\n* The Dealer: The Bothan on the crew is the negotiator. He doesn't actually take the forefront in most encounters (preferring to leave that to the Pilot), and he's not so good in combat, but he's an absolute master at wheeling and dealing. When the crew turns the Dealer loose on a world, if it's there to be found, he can find it. When he has to fight, he has a very dangerous (and quite illegal) disruptor pistol he usually keeps hidden.\n* The Pilot: The crew's pilot and, generally, the secondary \"face,\" is a flashy Duros with a weird thing for [Cad Bane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoSayqv1TVI), to the point where he's taken the name and is doing his best to imitate the character by purchasing a jet pack (with eventual intent to have it modified into a set of jet boots). He's the most outgoing of the group and handles a lot of the face-to-face work. His imitation of a notorious and dangerous bounty hunter while traveling with a group of people who all manage to have some form of bounty on their heads will *not* cause trouble for the group down the road, I swear. Fights with dual blasters when he does have to fight, but prefers to avoid combat using his jetpack.\n* The Killbot: Apparently a semi-defective assassin droid, the Killbot is a sneaky, amoral type. Deadly with a blaster rifle but not with much else, the Killbot can be a bit bad about getting the party in trouble. He tends to act as the party translator, as he's the only member of the group who can understand Mate's binary speech and the Furbag's native language, though he has been known to \"creatively\" interpret things before. Presumably due to buggy programming, he's somewhat inept with any weapon besides a blaster rifle despite not having the strength to aim anything bigger than a carbine unaided.\n* \"Mate\": Originally a generic NPC R4 astromech unit, the crew took an instant liking to Mate's bloody-minded outlook and tendency to communicate via rebus-style images from his holoprojector. They adopted him as a full member of the crew, and he handles ship maintenance and guards the ship while the rest of the party is off. Refuses to fight, since he's only armed with a simple shockprobe.\nAnd a new addition to the crew,\n\n* The Greasemonkey: This poor sap was picked up in The Shirt Bandits and the Destroyer's second part, which I promise I'll write eventually. The Destroyer killed his crew and left him alone, where he spent an unidentified amount of time up a tree drinking rainwater and eating whatever emergency rations he'd smuggled off the ship as he fled. Quiet, unassuming, completely uninterested in combat, but a mean hand with a wrench.\n\nThe Shirt Bandits had decided to proceed to  Corellia, in search of a historian who might be able to tell them more about the mysterious bauble they picked up in their introductory adventure (Shirt Bandits and the Crate O' Doom!). Their entry to the planet was quiet, but so too was their initial time spent wandering about. Completely out of character for this group, they all managed to avoid getting in trouble in such a major urban area for several days, until the Pilot picks up a com signal from a stranger requesting a meeting.\n\nThey do some scouting, and decide to attend the meeting; it's taking place in a cantina in a lower-class part of town, but while the place isn't fancy or nice, it's not a complete dive either. They figure they'll be okay if a fight breaks out.\n\nUnfortunately, rather than a fight, a lovely short-haired woman comes to the table and introduces herself, in a low voice, as Lyra Kast, CorSec officer (off duty, of course). Before they can recover, she goes around the table and addresses all of them (save the Greasemonkey) by name.\n\nSee, she had noticed the Pilot wandering around on one of the group's frequent trips into the city, and after some inquiry (as he'd caught her eye), found that he had a registered bounty, though it was from one of the Hutt bounty operations and not the Empire. More importantly, after some (rather costly) investigation and some cross-galactic HoloNet calls, she'd found that very nearly the entire group had some form of bounty registered with some body or another, including the Furbag who actually did have a modest official Imperial bounty.\n\nThey were suspicious, and she curtly informed them that she didn't really have much in the way of official grounds to move against them. On the other hand, she could make their lives very difficult indeed, via the simple means of some unofficial off-the-record calls to any of the nastier bounty hunters that might be operating on Corellia at the moment.\n\nShe told them that she had a proposition. There was a smuggler, a Mon Calamari (unusual, that) who had somehow set up a serious operation smuggling stims onto the planet. He'd gained a cozy relationship with the guards, and while he had a bounty on his head nobody had really gone after him.\n\nShe offered the following: if they took down the Mon Calamari smuggler boss, she'd help them collect his (sizable) bounty anonymously and safely. More importantly, she offered to help out if she could with whatever their actual business on the planet would be; she couldn't guarantee anything, but at the very least she could make it easier for them to operate in an Imperial-occupied world with a strong central law enforcement agency.\n\nThey took the deal and immediately set out, with the Furbag taking the mysterious object to a local university and the Killbot and the Dealer going hunting for some leads. It wasn't that hard for the Dealer to track down a tweaky Rodian addict trying to pawn off some cheap-grade drugs, and in typical efficient Killbot-and-Dealer fashion they grabbed him and threw him in the speeder.\n\nWhat did take them some time was calming him down, because on top of being freaked out by the kidnapping he was also tripping on something and having a bad time of it. The Dealer eventually got him soothed out and charmed him using a careful combination of smooth talk with the occasional flashing of both big dollar signs and a few of the last samples of glitterstim the party had saved from a previous adventure. He presented himself as a new supplier wanting in on the game, and the idea that bringing in such a whale might possibly deflect attention from his employers about the fact that he was probably using more of his stock than he was selling convinced the Rodian to try to set up a meeting.\n\nThe Shirt Bandits showed up at the meeting in force, with the Killbot staking out a spot on the roof with his big rifle and the rest of the team following Twitchy into the front operation. He led them through into the warehouse, where they were confronted by some big Human thugs and another irate human who seemed to be the leader of this particular operation.\n\nThe Dealer and the Pilot tried to work their charm on him, but he was (for some reason) noticeably more resistant to the smooth talk than Twitchy was. It was going badly, and half the party was getting ready to draw weapons...\n\nAnd then the back wall of the warehouse blew in. There was a modified hovertruck outside, and freaking Stormtroopers started dropping to the street below it from some drop panel on the underside.\n\nThe Wookie charged the boss and mauled him,  leaving the axe out of the equation in an attempt to keep him alive. The stormies already on the ground started to spray blaster fire into the warehouse, and the thugs carrying crates dropped them, took cover, and picked up blaster rifles that had spilled from the crates.\n\nThe Killbot immediately started sniping Stormtroopers from the roof while the rest of the party poured fire into them, as more and more stormies dropped from the transport. The Mechanic excused himself to sneak into the boss's office.\n\nThe Pilot, the crazy little bastard that he is, pulled a ridiculous stunt. He blasted off with his jetpack, flew forward and up into the open hatch of the assault truck, landed in motion toward the cab of the truck, jumped into the copilot's seat, and killed the pilot, all in one smooth-as-fuck move.\n\nThe Mechanic, on the other hand, found three things in that office: a bunch of slagged computers, an open hatch that went under street level and presumably to a bolt-hole of some sort, and a rather large bomb.\n\nUnderstandably, he went to work disarming the bomb while the rest of the party fought off the small squad of stormtroopers. It wasn't a terribly nasty fight; the stormtroopers spent their first rounds killing the human thugs, since they didn't have much chance of hitting the sniper and considered the beefcakes with the rifles a bigger threat than schmucks with pistols. Big mistake; the Dealer's disruptor pistol proved able to burn right through Stormtrooper armor.\n\nThe party killed the Stormies, the Mechanic successfully disarmed the bomb (by the skin of his teeth), and the Pilot managed to swipe a customized armored assault truck.\n\nIt was then that the second troop transport landed and started to demand an update on the status of their mission.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED...",

Its very loosely based on DnD 3.5 edition)\n\nSo our story begins with a group of 3 prisoners harvesting crops as manual labor. The prisoners are the human rogue, Sophie, the halfling wizard Dandi, and Falloran, the half-elf paladin. The group begins to see smoke over the horizon and see flames rapidly approaching their location. Dandi and Sophie make a run for it, back to the prison walls, while Falloran runs forward toward the flames to see if anyone needs help. He reaches a village and sees it in ruin and people are dying. Falloran realizes that there is nothing he can do to help and runs back to where Dandi and Sophie are standing trying to figure out how to get in the walls of the castle. The flames come within three feet of them and then freeze. A figure appears in front of them. The figure looks like the devil. He says, \"Not yet,\" and then disappears into flash of flames.\n\nThe Warden then appears and takes the prisoners to their cells and left them to rot. They explored the cell and found a skeleton with a note. The note was a spell. Once read out loud it caused a magic portal to open and allowed them to escape to a ship. The ship was abandoned and throughout searching the ship, they found a half-orc slave that went by the name Sunshine. They found some weapons and bailed off the side of the ship, going to an island. After several encounters, to include a wolf and a guy named Lucas and his warhammer Mitchell, they found a cave. On Lucas's body, they found a body a bounty on the firestarter, which Lucas assumed was the wizard, Dandi. The party's new mission; clear Dandi's name.",

So, overall, a rather relaxing day of adventuring. \n\nThe end goal of our adventure was a small farm in the middle(ish) of the farm.

        "text": "Looking back, a lot of my stories are just my character trying to prove his phenomenal cosmic power and it backfiring in one way or another. First there was the dark phoenix incident and now we have a dire situation involving an extreme vampire tennis death-match. Allow me to explain.\n\nAs stated before, this was a homebrew game with high absurdity and rules that could be bent like a bendy straw. The actors are Super Sneaks the antisocial rogue, the surprisingly charismatic Archer Bro and myself as the practitioner of all things arcane and swordplay and the main perpetrator of these tales.\n\nOur story takes place pretty early on in the campaign, I had yet to gain my signature soul sword or flame wheel spell. The three of us were tasked with investigating a town because all the guards were too busy blowing spit bubbles or something else equally important. So we march on down to the village and find it's completely inhabited by women. They all invite us into the town where everything is peaceful and wonderful and-\n\nUs- \"Look, we know they're evil. Can we skip to the part where they ambush us in the night?\"\n\nGM- \".....Fine you cheeky bastards\"\n\nSo it turns out the entire town was a bunch of vampire ladies. I thought vampires burned in sunlight but that's just me playing too much World of Darkness I suppose. So they try to attack in the middle of the night like we knew they were going to, but as soon as one opens the door to where we were staying they fall for our practical joke. It was kind of like that prank where you put a bucket of water on top of the door but instead of a bucket it was a bear trap, hilarious stuff really. The others rush in while the first is on the ground with her head nearly taken off, but by that point we had already escaped out the window and lit the fuse on the metric fuckton of alchemist fire we had hidden in the closet.\n\nThe building goes up in the night and we now have another problem on our hands; the problem of having an entire town of vampires looking for us and us with the need to kill them all in order to get our pay. So we start doing hit and fade tactics, Super Sneaks does his assassination stuff, Archer Bro shoots from the rooftops and I'm teleporting around, lopping heads off and chucking fireballs. This work well for a while until the vampires grouped together and started to hunt us down. So we came up with a plan to kill them all in one hit. We lured them all to the center of the town then teleported to the top of the tallest tower and I started to cast a fireball.\n\nLet me go into how magic worked in this setting real quick. Magic was something that anyone could but it caused a lot of mental strain. At the very beginning of the game, creating a small gust of wind was enough to cause a massive migraine. The only way to get better was to keep practicing and build up a resistance to the effects. Also, you could put as much energy into the spell as you wanted provided it didn't kill you. Where I'm going with this is I dumped all of my magical power into this fireball until it was the size of a small village and chucked it at the vampires below.\n\nGM- \"The fireball speeds towards the vampires, it is about to engulf the town and.... It starts coming back towards you\"\n\nMe- \"Wait, what?!\"\n\nGM- \"I'm saying they bounced it back at you.\"\n\nThey bounced it back. The fucking vampires blocked the  mile-long fireball I had put all of my energy into and slapped a Return to Sender sticker on it. The others were rightfully terrified by the ball of fiery death heading towards us and start to force feed me a potion that gets rid of the mental fatigue caused by magic use. My guy comes back to his senses with Archer Bro slapping him in the face and screaming to save our sorry hides. I get back on my feet and do the only thing that I could think of at the time, bounce it right back.\n\nAnd so began a ten minute match of tennis between me and the vampires. Neither of us were willing to just bounce it away so we kept sending it back at each other. At one point, the vampires send in another fire ball so now we had two mile-long death balls bouncing back and forth. I'm pretty busy at the time so the others have to think up another plan on their own. So they get down there and start creating distractions. Fire crackers, explosions, slaughtered animals with fresh blood, anything to try to get their attention on something other than the fireballs. This starts to take effect and their reaction for bouncing back the fireballs takes a little bit longer. Then came the final part of our plan.\n\nThe others are able to set some buildings on fire and cause mass hysteria among the vampires with some timed explosives provided by Archer Bro's affinity for alchemy and Super Sneak's ability to plant them unnoticed. As the explosions go off, I bounce the fireballs back and use the last of my energy to create a massive blast of wind that slid underneath the fireballs and hit the vampires. They all get knocked down and I fall unconscious for the second time in thirty minutes as the two mini nukes reach the ground. The combined force is enough to completely incinerate the town and the blast starts to reach the tower I'm sleeping on. Just as I'm about to go up in my own magic power, the others come back for me. Archer Bro shoots a grappling hook with some extra strength rope into the nearby woods and Super Sneaks hoists me onto his back as we all zip-line off the burning tower only feet away from death. The rope burns and we all fall to the ground but the explosion peters out before it can reach where we fell. We all just fell asleep right on the spot, recovering only feet away from the charred remains of our latest victory.\n\nSo that's how I nearly got us all killed with a fireball that I had put way too much faith into. If my friends hadn't been the last action heroes they decided to be in that last moment, my guy wouldn't have survived to slay Patches and the necromancer or raise the dark phoenix. They may be antisocial and/or slightly psychotic, but we're a team goddammit! \n\nSo I guess the moral is to be careful with what you throw around, you never know when it will come back at you in a way you didn't expect.",

        "text": "Yeah, we're [still](http://redd.it/37q4gd) playing [The Underground](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/673212907/the-underground-a-sam-and-fuzzy-rpg), and this session... uh. It was something.\n\nIt started out innocently enough. [Bullmime, avant-garde artist built like a deranged mime mixed with a pitbull](http://i.imgur.com/GPR6sZx.png), went into the wonderful underground community to talk shop with some talented arts folks. Simple, yeah? Discuss paint techniques, glue your hands to a chair, break down crying, build a scale model of the eiffel tower out of popsicle sticks and nail a few dead rats to the wall. Get chummy with your pals Bob the Builder and Hastur. But then... then the TV comes on.\n\nIt's a masked wrestling extravaganza. A poorly-planned tournament full of muscly men beating the shit out of each other. And the winner gets cash.\n\nBullmime, always a fan of live art and being deranged, signed up immediately. Unfortunately, another entrant was our OTHER player, Squidalibre, who was deep in debt and determined to wreck the shit of SOMETHING. Still nothing too serious, but just you wait. By the way, did I mention that [Squidalibre is a half-squid-half-wolfman-and-some-fraction-cyborg by this point](http://i.imgur.com/EKy6nOn.jpg)? And he fights with a wet pool noodle?\n\nSee, we have only two players competing against each other, but that doesn't mean all the others are just sitting on their asses and waiting for things to get going. I give them NPC prompts. They play the roles of minor characters. In this case, \"moral support\" and opposing luchadores. Thus, Squidalibre's pre-fight training montage was peppered with insults and belittlements from his sensei, a cranky old squid battlechef who was salty because Squidalibre had no food-making talent whatsoever. But he learned a secret technique, and oh yeah, Bullmime stapled a dead cat to her face.\n\nThen things get weird... or weirder, anyway. Squidalibre's manager (under player control) slips laxatives into all of the on-site catering. Squidalibre doesn't eat anything, but Bullmime does. And then the matches begin. Bullmime makes short work of her first opponent, and Squidalibre is thrown into the ring with a terrifying man known as The Streaker (player controlled), who was as batshit crazy as he was buck-ass naked. He also wielded a wet pool noodle, which was Squidalibre's gimmick, so naturally the two were bitter rivals. But the fight doesn't go well for Squidalibre.\n\nAfter a few sissy exchanged blows, Squidalibre tries to grapple the naked man. This was a situation that could not, would not, end well. See, The Streaker reversed the grapple, and lashed out with his, ahem, OTHER noodle. Straight towards Squidalibre's face. Squidalibre crit failed the check to keep his cool, and began to flip out all over the place. Which was right when The Streaker realized that his stomach was rumbling.\n\nSquidalbre emerged victorious with a mask that would have to be burned, a chest that was a lot browner and stickier than it used to be, and a permanent fear of naked men. To put it gently, he was not having a good day. Which is why it was unfortunate that he was up against Bullmime next. Her opening move was slapping him in the face with her dead cat mask and then trying to eat his face. Thankfully, Bullmime had more presence of mind than The Streaker, and when her stomach started rumbling, she fled the ring. Squidalibre won by default, though he was on his last legs.\n\nRight before his final fight, Squidalibre's manager filled the man up to the eyeballs with morphine, sprayed him off with a firehose and threw him into the ring. His next opponent was someone called [Prayer Puncher](http://pre00.deviantart.net/06a4/th/pre/f/2015/154/a/4/prayer_puncher__by_myan149-d8vx8xa.png), who rather oddly resembled a [certain hitchhiker](http://redd.it/2l50cg). She was no slouch at combat, so Squidalibre opened up with his secret technique, scoring a hit without even having to roll. Prayer Puncher and her busy fists came back strong, pounding the soft wolf-squid-borg until his morphine high started to wear off. They were both barely dodging blows from eachother, vying for that last knockout punch that would win the match.\n\nTen misses. The wrestlers traded frenzied blows and got ten misses, when even a single hit would decide the match. Then, Prayer Puncher got a lucky hit and dropped the flagging Squidalibre to critical condition. He had strength for one last blow...!  \nPrayer Puncher rolled a 24.\nSquidalibre rolled a 26.\n\nTheir fists met like a thunderstorm, and the impact shattered Prayer Puncher's arm. She fell to the ground moments before Squidalibre did, as the sparkly morphine lights finally winked out. Technically, it was a pin, and Prayer Puncher couldn't beat the count in time to secure her victory.\n\nWith that, Squidalibre had won the title, and gotten enough prize money to pay off his debts and live comfortably for a while (preferably while high on morphine). So he had a few scars. And he would never look at corn the same way again. But he had done it. He was his own man. And he was the CHAMP.\n\nFade to black with an instrumental rendition of \"We Are The Champions\", as Bullmime tries unsuccessfully to steal Squidalibre's wallet.",

        "text": "I was inspired to post this by the other DayZ tale. This was a couple of years ago, in DayZ Epoch, on a private server with two of my friends, who I will call Kyle and Shawn. \n\nWe were doing pretty well for ourselves. We had built a small base, we had enough food and medical supplies for a little while, and we had found a civilian helicopter in one of the cities, so we were set on transportation. After consulting our maps and our sole gps unit, we decided to loot a nearby town (one of the small, no-name ones). Taking some bandages, a little food and water, and our best weapons, we set out in the helicopter. \n\nKyle was flying while Shawyn and I talked and double checked out inventories. While over a densely wooded hilly area, disaster struck. Kyle had been looking at his map and, while his attention was still diverted, managed to fly directly into the side of a hill. The helicopter goes down, Shawn and I are freaking out wondering what's going on, and the teamspeak channel is filled with cursing and confused questions. A couple of seconds later, the chopper slams into the ground.\n\nAt this point, it's worth noting that the three of us take dying in video games very seriously. If you die, you stop talking in the teamspeak channel until you can rejoin the group. No exceptions. So after the chopper hit the ground, Shawn and I were understandably worried when Kyle wouldn't answer our questions. A short investigation revealed three things: Kyle was DOA, Shawn had a broken leg, and I was bleeding profusely. I patched myself up and looted Kyle's corpse. Unfortunately, we had no morphine, so Shawn remained on the ground, restricted to a slow crawl. As we heard the telltale sound of zombies drawing ever closer, I was forced to make a hard choice. I pulled out our Springfield and walked towards Shawn. \n\n\"Sorry about this man, but we won't make it with your busted leg.\"\n\n\"No, wait! We have enough ammo, we can probably-\" **BLAM** Shawn fell silent. \n\nAfter looting his body as well, I began the long journey back to our base. I was alone, with no one to talk to and no one to watch my back, and I came close to dying several times, but eventually, I made it to the city closest to our base (Electro for you DayZ fans). I was on a bike I had found a couple of towns back, and I was running dangerously low on food and water. Going around the city would take far too long; I had to go through it. I went as fast as I could, stopping very briefly every so often to consult my map, but I wasn't fast enough. Trapped in a dead end with zombies all around, I fought my way out and abandoned the bike. I was bleeding, and bleeding bad, but I had no more bandages. The color drained from my vision as I stumbled towards our hastily built base. Crossing the threshold, I was met by Kyle and Shawn. \n\n\"Hey guys! I salvaged our stuff, but I'm bleeding pretty bad. Either of you have a band-\" **BLAM** I fell silent as Shawn's bullet hit home and the two of them began looting my body. \n\nShawn later told me that that was his payback and that we were even now, but from that point on, I was always a little on edge whenever I was scavenging with him.

        "text": "I just found this subreddit today but reading through your tales has made me remember many of my own. I've been playing D&amp;D since I was 10 so for nearly two decades I've played characters and for fourteen of those years I've also made adventures for characters.\n\nOne character though, in my mind at least, stands above all others. This fellow played with me for five of my nineteen years and he was a staple of my games for a long long time.\n\nHutch Tinyfists was without a doubt the most badass gnome fighter of all time. He survived things that players twice his size modifier could not have and finally had to be retired at level 20 because the adventures I crafted for him were too grand for normal players. Hutch did not save the world; he saved worlds (plural) and multiverses.\n\nI've got a lot of stories about him but this one still makes me laugh.\n\nSo without further ado, lords and ladies, I bring you\nAn ode to Hutch Tinyfists\nPart 1: Tiny Fist to the crotch\n\nIn one of his early adventures Hutch was drinking at the bar with the members of his party (they were getting information about a thieves guild plot but Hutch was doing the drinking for all of them)\n\nHutch was in contest with a Halforc at the bar. The Halforc had tied him in drink and began to brag about how he was stronger by far than a halfling. Hutch could not dispute this (his strength was only 13 after all) but claimed that he certainly had the better constitution.\n\n\"At least your wife believes this to be so.\" Said Hutch but the orc sired dog only laughed \n\n\"I doubt a man such as you could bed a woman such as mine ya puny dog!\"\n\nHutch only nodded and left the bar\n\n250 gold in bribes, 2 charisma checks, and 3 constitution checks later he walked back into the bar with the half orcs wife who told all who would hear how the tiny man was indeed a better lover than her beastial husband.\n\nThis was the half Orc shamed and Hutch proved that strength means nothing when you have to roll perfect twenties each turn to lift your brass balls\n\nTLDR\n\n(Carter, who plays Hutch took offense during a game to something I made an NPC say while he was drinking instead of helping and used the hour his group was allotted to gain information to search the city for the NPC's wife, have graph paper relations with her successfully, and than flaunt his triumph)\n\nHis party also stopped what they were doing to see if he could pull it off so they were poorly prepared for the Thieves Guild ",

That's just how it's going to be from now on, because I will not have ONE FUCKING POST break the format.\n\nIn any case, about three fourths of the way through the last session, [The Glorious Chucklefucks](https://i.imgur.com/rOaUt25.jpg) returned to the city from which they had been sent out most recently to report on the completion of their mission to the king. Patrick tries to steal some shit, Nathaniel goes off somewhere to do something, Spencer's new character gets some mercenary work unrelated to the party (as he has yet to be given a compelling in-game reason to join the chucklefucks) and Friedrich prepares to leave on a holy pilgrimage. I ask what Noel is doing, and JD responds by asking how many tailors there are in the city. I tell him there are three. If I had only known then what he had planned, I might have told him there were none.\n\nNoel goes to the first tailor and asks if he can make the exact same outfit Noel (who is currently female due to magical shenanigans, so female pronouns will apply henceforth) is wearing, but for each of the three seasons other than the one it was originally designed to be worn in. Now, this outfit is pretty fucking fabulous, basically an exact copy of the outfit worn by [this motherfucker](http://th04.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2013/293/e/f/jotaro_2014_blue_by_superhedgehogtx-d6r7xvh.png). The tailor takes the order, but then Noel decides to go to the second tailor on the other side of town and make the same request, but this time just for a winter version. That tailor makes the winter outfit, and Noel pays him...then goes back to the first guy and cancels her original order, asking for just the fall version. He makes it, she pays him, then goes BACK TO THE OTHER GUY and orders a spring version of the outfit, assuming that the original was meant for summer. The tailor fucking makes it, Noel buys it, and now she has a variation on that one stupid fucking outfit for every season. At this point, we're all laughing heartily at JD's shenanigans, assuming he's done.\n\nMotherfucker is just getting started.\n\nHe reminds me that the original outfit is REVERSIBLE, and that the flip side has a different color scheme. So Noel goes BACK TO THE OTHER GUY and asks for a winter version of the outfit in this new color scheme. She gets that shit, then goes BACK TO THE OTHER GUY and so on, until she has a full seasonal set in the new color scheme as well. Noel is hemorrhaging money by now, and the table is in chaos. Donovan and Garrett are both wanting to get back to what they're doing, but I say \"No. I want to see where he's going with this. I was sure there must have been some kind of objective, some point to all of this.\n\nNah, fuck that.\n\nNoel goes BACK TO THE OTHER GUY and says (we're blurring the lines between in-character and out-of-character bullshit pretty hard by this point) \"HEY BRO,\" asking for a fucking tank top in about four different colors. Then it's BACK TO THE OTHER GUY and she says \"HEY BRO,\" wanting to buy a bunch of their fucking dye. BACK TO THE OTHER GUY and \"HEY BRO,\" she orders a bunch of their fucking dye, but DIFFERENT COLORS than those she had already bought. Shit has been lost by this point, JD is clearly trying to get rid of all of Noel's money. He is struggling to think of new shit to buy as I try to get my fucking jaw back up out of the Earth's crust. Then he asks, \"Is there a blacksmith in this city?\"\n\nNoel fucking goes to the blacksmith and asks him to remake her fucking CHAIN in two different colors. This, finally, costs all the money she has, and the shopping spree grinds to a halt. I take several deep breaths. People have left the table. Sides are in orbit. And JD has the most smug fucking shit-eating grin I have ever seen. The whole fiasco ended up eating more than twenty minutes of the session, and it was about ten more afterwards before we could focus in and actually resume playing. JD assures me that as soon as Noel gets more money, the fashion fuckery will resume. I believe him. And I am afraid. \n\nFuck the sign-off, this was not business as usual. This was a Bizarre Fashion Adventure.",

He was a seasoned DM and he needed one more so I agreed (my shadowrun group was barely meeting once a month and other than college and FNM I didn't have much of a schedule)\n\nSo I roll up a Bard (rogue was taken already and he didn't want two of any class) and off we go. We were four levels into a campaign (fight a cult that's trying to summon an elder God and blah blah blah) when we come to a town. They are having trouble with a group of female assassins and will pay us handsomely for helping them so we away to the nearby \"dark and dreary fort\" to do battle with this league of comely assassins. After murdering a metric shit ton of assassins (we gained almost two levels off this side quest) we come to the leader who is surprisingly a man. He's a bard/swashbuckler and apparently he has a magic lute. After defeating him and another slew of assassins it's decided I should have the lute since I was the bard. This was the paper I was given describing this lute\n\nLute of Whore summoning\n1d4 damage if used as weapon\nNo crit\nCan be used to summon 1 whore, prostitute, slattern, strumpet, lady of questionable moral compass, \"entertainer\", \"dancer\", \"med student\", or slut per level of bard per round.\nRoll 1d20 when used. If a 20 is rolled summon double this amount or 2 dominatrix's \n(There followed stats for dominatrix's and random whores who depending on rolls could have random items, armor, etc)\n\nDid I say paper? This thing was a narrative. I think he put more effort into this one item than he had the whole plot of the adventure. We found two or three other weapons that had crazy eldritch powers too as the story unfolded but nothing quite as crazy as this loot.\n\nFast forward a month. We have reached 0 hour, the portal is open and we have an hour before its big enough for the elder God to come through and simply turn our world into pink slime or something.\nFighter: I'm going to lead our armies against his legions. (Rogue) you sneak in and see if you can kill the summoner. (Priest) your with me. (Ranger) use your bow (it's was also pretty epic) and find a vantage point.\nMe: what do I do?\nFighter: (dead pan stare) you take that lute and you summon as many sluts, slatterns, and skaggy old street walkers as your can. Fill this battle field with as many strumpets as you can muster and we may still live to see the sunrise!\"\n\nApparently 7 scared as hell prostitutes a turn who are running around causing chaos turned the tides nicely.\n\nI've played a lot of his crazy campaigns since then but that by far was the most memorable  ",

He has since utilized the quarry to begin construction of town fortification's and sent word to my Zhentarim allies that the town has been secured as well as the church of Bane. They have sent me 100 Zhentarim mercenaries to help me control the area along with supplies and craftsman to assist in turning it into a stronghold.\nMy cleric has the soldier background but only holds the rank of Sergeant.

We were driving around and gathering loot and decided to go to a military base to get some military gear. We decided to drive to NW Airfield because that is usually where there are most loot, and some times even planes or choppers on the server we were playing on. We finally got there and started to loot a barrack, when I spotted a heliplane or whatever they are called (the plane that are also a helicopter). I ran over to it and checked its condition and fuel level. Everything were green, and we decided to take it for a spin. My friend asked me if I knew how to fly, and I said yes. I mean, I have read how to fly it online, that was surely enough. I started to speed up and everything were going smoothly, and then, suddenly, I accidentally pressed the wrong button and it switched from plane mode to helicopter mode, which resulted in it making a backwards salto and landing upside down, on the roof of a building.\n\nIt wasn’t good, because we couldn’t get down from the roof without dying. I had to use all my pilot skills to get it to slide down from the roof and onto a hill beside it. Of course there was a tree in the way, which one of the propels were trying to cut down, so the plane started to smoke. I screamed to my friend that he should jump out and run for his life. I wasn’t going to leave my new baby, if she was going to blow up, I was gonna blow up with her. My friend didn’t share my feelings for the plane, so he jumped out. We both kind of underestimated how far up the doors were, so he broke his leg when he landed on the ground. He had to crawl away from the plane which was going to explode any second.\n\nI don’t know how to explain what happened next, but somehow the plane got loose and landed on its wheels. My friend was now stuck under the plane, and the propel were still having a battle with the tree. I decided the plane wasn’t worth the fuzz, so I jumped out and started to run away from it. My friend screamed for help. He begged me to help him, but what should I do? If I tried to help him we could both die. It was a numbers game, and this way I was at least sure that one of us would survive. I got safely away, and turned around to look at the plane.

        "text": "A bit of context about the game first, since I know fairly few people play it. Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead (or CDDA for short) is a free roguelike zombie game (although there's a lot more than just zombies) set in post-apocalyptic New England. The game is tough as nails, and you tend to die a lot, at least at first. If you know about the game \"Project Zomboid\", Cataclysm:dda is the same thing, but better (in my opinion) and free.\n\nOne day, my new character had to make a town raid, since supplies in the evacuation shelter were nonexistant, and he was getting hungry and thirsty fast. Unfortunately, I fucked it up and soon I was running from town with a red health bar on half my limbs. This normally wouldn't have been a problem, as most zombies are very slow, but I was being chased by a Z-9. See the K-9 units police use? Now think the zombified version, still strapped in a Kevlar Harness. If the armor wasn't bad enough, they are not slow like most zombies, but are actually faster than most characters.\n\nLittle furry bastard would have been faster than me at full health, but I was at 3/4^ths of my normal speed, mostly because of damage to my legs. Plus, they're impossible to hit, and their Kevlar Harness just soaks up all of the damage that does get through. I was armed with a piece of sharp metal stuck at the end of a curtain rod. Basically, I was fucked.\n\nThen, while looking around in desperation, I saw a single moose fairly close to my location. \n\nNow, when I say \"moose\", I'm sure you're already thinking of a cuddly big goof, funny to look at but ultimately harmless, right? You might be wondering what those oversized Teddy Bears have to do with anything, right? Wrong. Moose in CDDA are scary as fuck. They are at least twice as fast as humans, are surprisingly agile for their size (making them hard to hit), have a lot of hit points and most importantly of all, are *very*, *very* aggressive. Because of this, my next action was a risky gamble. I said to myself \"Hey, what if I made them fight each other while I run away?\"\n\nYou see, in the game, creatures of different factions (zombies, animals) are as much enemies to each other as they are to you, and will often fight among themselves. Seeing as my chances of killing the Z-9 were very slim, I lead it towards the moose and sure enough, they started killing each other as I sort of hobbled in the opposite direction. My thought process was that, since they were both so impossible to kill, they should be busy for a while, giving me ample time to run away, despite my poor condition.\n\nThe moose killed the Z-9 in under 5 turns and killed it so hard it pulped the body all over the place. But then, it decided its blood rampage hadn't gone on for long enough, and that it was still pissed as fuck, and that it was going to take it out on ME. \n\nSo then it started chasing me. And then it started pummeling me to death while I tried (and failed) to hurt it. I didn't have anything remotely capable to do anything to it fast enough to avoid death, so I did the last thing I could: I took a picture of it with a camera I'd found in town, since there was nothing else I could do, and then I died.\n\nI like to think that somewhere, out there, there is a mangled and barely recognizable as human corpse, and lying next to it, a camera, with a single picture on it: that of a raging moose, blood covering it hooves and horns and its eyes glowing red with almighty fury.\n\nLet that picture serve as a warning: Do NOT fuck with moose.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/387toy/how_the_chucklefucks_conclude_a_covert/",
        "text": "At the end of the session previous to this one, [The Glorious Chucklefucks](https://i.imgur.com/rOaUt25.jpg) had reached the climax of their \"covert\" investigation into an underground crime syndicate by launching a raid on their base of operations. The first group of goons had been dealt with handily, but then a door had flown off its hinges and Patrick had responded by blindly charging into the room beyond. He had found himself surrounded by six goons, a wizard, and a particularly burly goon, all of whom were ahead of him in the initiative order. At the beginning of this session, Donovan is asking me if he can just go ahead and roll up his next character ahead of time. I tell him to wait, as Patrick hasn't died yet.\n\nFriedrich goes first, deals some decent damage to the burly dude, but he can't get to Patrick. Then Nathaniel steps up, and motherfucker casts Time Stop. He gets four actions before time resumes flowing, and if he directly acts on anyone the stop ends. He first casts Haste on himself, queuing up an extra action that he'll be able to use after time starts back up. Then the motherfucker throws out two Delayed Blast Fireballs, at seventh and eighth level. These fucking things are essentially high-powered explosive charges which he can set off at will and from the effects of which he can exempt his allies. His final action goes to casting a regular old Fireball, the damage of which he maxes out and exempts his friends from with some bullshit class feature ability. Time resumes, and all eight enemies take the damage from three massive fucking explosions which appear out of nowhere, thus taking them all completely by surprise.\n\nI calculate the damage. Everyone is dead.\n\nSo, from the perspective of everyone else in the room: a wizard steps into the doorway, and an instant later the equivalent of a huge fucking bomb has gone off, everything is on fire, and the building is collapsing. Bad guys are all dead, but you can't exempt your allies from the damage of a metric fuck ton of rubble. Nathaniel uses his earlier queued Haste action to cast Dimension Door and teleport out the front door of the building with Friedrich, and the others are far enough from the blast that they easily pass their checks to escape the building. Patrick seems to be in trouble though; he's standing at ground zero, blind, deaf, and disoriented, with a building about to fall on his head. His Dex check to react in time to teleport into a safe shadow outside is very high. He fucking passes that shit.\n\nThe Chucklefucks are all safe and have just fucking wrecked the group they were sent to investigate...all except for one guy. The miniboss of this quest, having tanked the damage from a building falling on his head, climbs out of the rubble like a champ and advances on the group. Patrick teleports into his shadow, jumps up onto his shoulder, and starts ripping off his armor. Then Noel decides to start using some of the Sorcery Points he's been saving up to, through some bullshit finagling of Metamagic, hit the boss with three Disintegrate spells in one round. Motherfucker lives, but he isn't doing so hot. Then it's Nathaniel's turn, and he decides to use Banishment. Now, I know how this spell works (this time) and point out that he can only send the enemy to a harmless demiplane, and only for up to one minute...unless he maintains concentration for that full minute, in which case the target just remains there. No other enemies around to disrupt concentration, goodbye boss. \n\nFuck.\n\nThe PCs then set about searching the ruins, find a secret underground lab which survived the blast. A lot of sketchy shit down there, including some incriminating evidence. I mention that the floor is coated in a strange blue powder (a common byproduct of certain alchemical processes, although the PCs don't know that) and Donovan announces that he wants to have Patrick lick the floor. MFW. Youfuckingwot.gif? This kind of reckless shit is sort of in keeping with his character (see earlier blind charge into goon-filled room) so I let him do it. His tongue immediately starts to dissolve, leading the \"warforged druid\", having some knowledge of alchemy, to scramble around the lab desperately searching for a base to counteract the acid. He finds one and tosses it in Patrick's face, then washes that off with copious amounts of water, and then finally has Friedrich Lay On Hands to heal the horrible burns. Patrick, undaunted, collects some of the powder in a vial and carries on.\n\nAs they are leaving, an unknown force draws the miniboss back from the harmless demiplane to launch his attack anew, prompting the \"warforged druid\" to shoot him with the Jakkawab. He gets the result which puts him back where he was a year ago, which leaves the psychic ant in his colony on another continent and the warforged in the middle of the wasteland he was exploring at the time, now unable to function without the ant. Spencer began rolling a new character while the others finished off the boss.\n\nSome Deck of Many Things hijinks on the boat home led to the summoning of a genie and Nathaniel getting one wish, but the rest of the session after the miniboss's defeat was mostly falling action...that is, except for JD's Bizarre Fashion Adventure. That is a story so fucking outrageous, it requires a Game Tale of its own, and it will get one soon. As for the rest of the day's events, were they bizarre? Yes. But it's just business as usual for these chucklefucks.",

Again, it is dangerously close to a deadline they have to meet. The man they have to meet will be waiting downstairs at 9:00. It is 8:50 now. Silver decides to quickly make breakfast for everyone and they make their way to the lobby after their morning routines. The man they have to meet is already there, standing silently by the door. He is a Mountainfolk by the name of N. Along with him is Ælvis (who finally managed to show up), who was also running late and had stayed in a different inn. N explains that he requires the party's assistance in exploring some ruins in the canyon outside the city. The party agrees to investigate further and leaves for the canyon by Ælvis’ car-- Silver is driving, Aharoni’s at shotgun, Fi and N are in the back and Ælvis is in the trunk; an ironic twist. \n\nWhen the party reaches a slim rope bridge over the canyon, they decide to proceed on foot over the rickety passage. As they near the stairs down the canyon’s side, they notice a number of small figures moving energetically in the distance. They assume at first that these are the canyon’s resident archaeologists, preparing for a new dig. However, as the party draws closer, it becomes apparent that the archaeologists are actually knocked out on the canyon floor. These are instead bandits who are raiding the area!\n\n3 of the bandits are riding on motorcycles, each decorated with colorful art. We manage to disperse the bandits, and claim their loot, which consists of:\n\n3 bikes (One decorated with drawings of blue whales, one with green butterflies, and one with yellow bees)\n\nA longsword\n\nLots of cash\n\nThey manage to get to the site, slightly recovered from the fight, to find all the archeologists knocked out cold. After making sure the archeologists are ok, they head into the ruins and are quickly separated by some unknown force. \n\nThe party wanders through the hallways blindly, not even the Night Elf's eyes nor the High Elf's flame can help them navigate these dark corridors. I’m still not sure as to what happened to everyone else because the DM had us encounter it equally, but I ran into a wall with a mouth on it, into which I poured the contents of a shit jar. From this I got an eyeball. I later found another room with a pool of eyeballs, and returned the eyeball to it’s family.\n\nWe seemingly clear the dungeon, as the mysterious magic that separated us previously has been dispelled. We work our way to the heart of the ruins, and the party manages to find a machine that piques N's interest. There he places some moss in a slot and steps inside a cylinder shaped chamber connected to the machine. Once inside he laughs maniacally. Shit.",

        "text": "TL:DR at the bottom\n\nSo a little backstory before I get into the details. My character is a neutral good Ranger by the name of Wayne Draconis. He is the human descendant of the (homebrewed) god of good dragons, Draconis. Draconis has this sword, sort of a family heirloom, known as Dragonsbane. The sword got lost somewhere down the bloodline, and Wayne has made it his goal to find it. \n\nAlright now for the story. My party entered an ancient green dragon's lair (We find out later his name was Broken-Scale), one who had been housing a lizardfolk army that defected from our BBEG, Jenison Fey. New Athens (our current country's capital) asked us to remove the army in fear that a bigger problem that was raising, the Order of the Dragon's Claw, may use the army against Jenison and possibly destroying a city in the process. So we take care of the army and recruit a bunch of them for future use (thank god for the Druid that spoke lizard), and we get to the hallway before the dragon.\n\nNow our DM lets us roll percent to pray to the gods, the lower the better. So of course I'm asking Draconis for help, since Green Dragons are evil. I roll a 01, and don't get much other than a \"You are doing the Good Lord's work kiddo!\", but I think it helped me with this later bit. Next were a few other of the party's gods and goddesses, not much there, until I reach the rogue. She has Hecate, goddess of witchcraft. I rolled a 05. A plan to get the information I wanted pops into my head. \"I ask for an evil aura to disguise me.\" The DM gives me a smirk and makes it true, next thing I know he is describing my new pale look and black and red armor. I grab the two magicians that know Draconic the best, borrow a Order cloak that was taken earlier in the session, and get dressed for the occasion. I rolled Draconis again and asked for forgiveness for what I was about to do and double zeroed, best roll of the night prayer wise. We move any good characters to the back and I walk in with the two magicians, both wearing masks and all three of us in cultist cloaks. We wake the dragon and the conversation is as such.\n\n\"Oh great and powerful dragon, I come seeking your aid.\"\n\n\"What do you seek that risks waking a dragon from his slumber, human?\"\n\n\"I am Lloyd Bradington, a member of the Order of the Dragon's Claw, and I am on a mission that I think you could help with. I seek to dethrone the platinum dragon, the god of good dragon's himself, Draconis.\"\n\nThe dragon seems to perk up at the mention of Draconis. \"Is that so? And why come seeking my aid? Do you wish for me to fight a god?\"\n\nI raise my hand, dressed in a hydra claw gauntlet, and shake my head in disagreement. \"No mighty one, I only come seeking information, you see I wish for Draconis to have an ironic death. I seek to kill him with his own blade, Dragonsbane.\"\n\n\"Ah yes, Dragonsbane. My father fought against that blade once before, along side Vlad the Impaler. The wield was one of his descendants, a Draconis human.\"\n\n\"Have you any idea where the blade may be now?\"\n\n\"After my father killed the Draconis child, I believe the knights of the round may have collected the blade. You seek them for further answers.\"\n\n\"Thank you mighty one.\"\n\nI'll skip the covering my ass bit where I ask for something on behalf of the Order, it was along the lines of recruiting him against Jenison, and I asked for his name before returning to my party. We act as if we left and the dragon falls back asleep. So remember that rogue I mentioned? Well she is good \"friends\" with a demon in the shadow realm (I guess DM's version of shadowfell) and was hiding and waiting for us to leave. She drops out of the ceiling and lands on the dragon's back, dealing 144 damage in backstab damage with her equipment. At the same time all the spellcasters (and myself with a ring of spell storing) unleash a wave of magic missiles and chain lightnings. The rest of the fighters rush up and get a free hit on Broken-Scales. All the while, our clerics are chanting, giving us even more bonus damage. End of our turn, we kill the ancient green dragon with about 360~ points of damage. The big boss encounter of the night, killed in one turn. Speech and fight lasted 30 minutes exactly, and I walked out of there with the most valuable piece of information to my character, and a new alter ego. Draconis rewarded me with a shiny new look (red glow of a draconian hero, and fixed my armor and alignment detection back to normal) and we loot the horde.\n\nTL:DR Ranger asks for help from gods, gets it, tricks a dragon, dragon dies in one turn, and Ranger knows where to look for artifact sword. Good session everybody.\n",

[Custom] or [Fine Game of Nil]?)\n\nThe party woke up in the morning well rested. The DM, not wanting us to crit toast again, changes the baking system to a d100. Silver still crits. We then go out shopping, and after a stop at the bank and a walk around town, the group manages to acquire: \n\nOne (1) Lovecraftian Horror Book - FREE\n\nOne (1) Italian Longsword Instruction Manual - FREE\n\nOne (1) Longsword – $80\n\nOne (1) Book on Magical Martial Arts in the 20th Century - FREE\n\nTwo (2) Knives - $40 each\n\nOne (1) Coin Sword - $50\n\nTwo (2) Moss-Bound Dolls - $60 \n\nOne (1) Quartz Ring - $700\n\nIn the process, SIlver tried to flirt with the librarian, who proceeded to wallop him over the head with a book. Still managed to get the Longsword practice book though.\n\nAt the end of the shopping trip, the group breaks up—Silver runs an errand for the general store, collecting cranberries around the city. Fi follows. Meanwhile, I go to visit the church down the road.\nThe church was silent and brilliant—the atrium shimmering with multicolored light, and silken drapes seeming to hover over the windows, swaying in the pleasant breeze. White marble lined the building’s already majestic features. For a while, I sat next down to an old man, thinking, but soon decided to head into the vestry, which was much smaller than the rest of the church but no less beautiful. For the rest of the evening, I spoke with a nun about the church’s teachings. I have been converted.\n\nItems/Information acquired this evening:\n\nOne (1) extra basket of cranberries. \n\nInformation about the Church of the God of Light\n\nFinally, late at night, the group meets again in the bar. Earlier in the day, Silver was shooed out of the bar by the owner because of his Night Elf heritage. However, the bar has been opened to him now that the bartender, a Wood Elf by the name of Ann, is watching over the building while the owner sleeps. As it turns out, the bar is unable to sell or even stock alcohol due to the strict law enforcement in this town. Instead, they sell drinks such as apple juice and root beer. At the end of the day, the group gathers there and recounts what they did that day. Soon the bar closes and everyone heads to the hotel, unaware of the eve.",

Before we can do that, however, our DM has decided that the final dungeon before the hiatus needs to be a meat grinder.\n\nWhile planning her campaign, our DM decided to create a random dungeon using an online resource and set one of the modifiers to turn it into a trap wasteland... knowing that my group has a tendency to just charge forward and not bother searching for traps. \n\nThis problem was further modified by 2 things:\n\n* 1) We have founded our own religion devoted to the worship of the deity Dickbutt and have developed a list of the 10 \"Dickmmandments\" which we all follow, with the first being that wooden doors are offensive to Dickbutt and must immediately be kicked in.\n\n* and 2) Our rogue stopped showing up due to a new job and apparent lack of interest in playing, so we have no one with proficiency in searching for traps.\n\nTo make matters worse, our Duegar barbarian named Lolipop contracted Lycanthropy and is right on the cusp of \"wolfing\" out. She also possesses our bag of holding (or in this case a beard of holding) where she stores all our goodies, along with some various farm animals, pets, weapons, and random shit.\n\nSo we reach our first wooden door of the campaign, and as the high priestess of Dickbuttism, I find it my duty to kick it in, but also found a bookshelf and the draw of further level 3 spell insanity took my attention away, resulting in Lolipop and the other barbarian Bloodfart stepping in and kicking the door, which promptly erupted in flames almost killing Bloodfart.\n\nWe learned our lesson though! We decided the best idea we could do is use one of the farm animals in Lolipop's beard (a goat in this case) as a test for further traps (and we named the goat Canary fittingly). So Canary strolls down the hallways and triggers another trap, releasing a black cloud of.... something. A detect magic spell eventually revealed that our walking trap detector was now cursed that it needed to make a wisdom save to do ANY action!\n\nSo after much provoking (including a nat 20 kick on Canary that sent her hurtling into a stone wall), Canary met her end triggering yet another trap... this time a pendulum which cut her in two.\n\nUndeterred, Lolipop summoned Edgar, a mighty bovine from her beard of holding to take Canary's place. Edgar needed less provoking, So we quickly decided that in order to keep him alive he needed protection. Two swords were tied to his body and he was outfitted with a helmet that featured a spike on time for those tricky doors he needed to ram.\n\nEdgar eventually reached a wide open (but dark room) that features the sounds of laughter and talking. As I don't wanna make this post too long, stay tuned for part 2 tomorrow to hear the rest of the story on how we completely invalidated the DM's plans for Lolipop's transformation.",

        "text": "Bruised and bloodied I limp towards the door. My chest was burning and my knuckles were bruised. Everything hurt like hell and the only chance to find my son just ran the hell away. I needed to drink some mead and lie down, I needed rest. But hearing the sounds of battle outside I knew it wasn't over. Straightening up I unsheathe my daggers and smirk. I can rest when I'm dead I thought, as I began running down the stairs. There was a battle to be won and I sure as hell am not missing any of the glory for winning it. I dashed down the stairs and through a large pair of double doors, meeting two drow as i left, they both turned in surprise, meeting a swift end by my blades. After killing the two drow I looked around for a bit finding my next targets. Spotting a group of 15 I grab both spears from the fallen drow and charge them. Looking at me as though I had lost my mind the group counter charged. Exactly like i expected them too. I flung both spears with all the strength I could muster. The spears flew through the air and directly through the chest of two of the men, 13 to go. The remaining men slowed down. Long enough for me to unsheath my throwing knives. 10 knives thrown, nine drow fell dead. I was getting rusty i thought smiling. The remaining 4 showed no signs giving up, which was good since I'm not a fan of leaving people trying to kill me alive. Except her... I shrugged off the thoughts her and tried to get back to the task at hand. I chunked my dirk into the closest drow sliting anothers throat and stabbing the last in the eye. Retrieving my dirk I looked for my next bit of prey. A sudden whistle of an arrow going towards me ended my search as I dove to the left. Only to watch a drow priestess fall behind me. Looking back I see Marana, the half elf ranger, smiling with bow in had standing 10 yard behind me. \"Pay attention pretty boy\" she said with a wink. I answered her with a glare as I stood up from my embarrassing fall.\nTOO BE CONTINUED.......",

        "text": "Lom (whose name was originally Hieren-Zuu Rensher Jheall'Arren Lombarrs of Ironoak) was the very first character I ever played who perished during regular play.\n\nLom was gigantic, even by Centaur standards - better than nine feet tall with shoulders nearly five feet across, he was a goddamned titan.  Physically imposing.  Massively powerful.  \n\nFunctionally retarded.  \n\nI'm using that word literally.  \n\nVery early on in the campaign, Lom was struck with a vicious curse that granted him increased strength (which was nearly superhuman to begin with) in return for absolutely tanking his INT (which was... really kind of shit already.) \n\nOnce you got through the small print and special details, Lom was barely more intelligent than an actual horse and in some ways he was considerably *less*.\n\nHe could not read or write and had serious difficulties conversing with any living being - he had to take a lot of extra time forming words into language and his functional vocabulary was less than 60 words.   \nEven the simplest concepts needed to be broken down for him as though he was a toddler.  \n\nFurther, his sheer size meant he couldn't *fit* in some dungeon crawls - two of the other players actually ended up building heavy-duty demolition equipment just so the simple act of getting through doorways didn't have to be a massive production spanning an entire session and that is not a fucking exaggeration.\n\nPlus also he stank like a barn.\n\nOh also he was fiercely loyal, morally pure, held nothing but complete and total unconditional love for the other members of the party and also was impossibly strong.  \n\n*Impossibly* strong.   \n\nIf he was not careful - and it was *very very difficult* for him to be careful - he'd break shit by touching it the wrong way.  Shit like doors, carts, errant food stands, livestock, people.  \n\nAfter he straight-up shattered four longbows of increasing size and tensile strength, the party just bought him a fucking ballista, ditched all the mechanical parts and just handed over the gigantic, metal bow.  \n\nIt took a full round to draw but once loosed, he could blow a steel golem to pieces in a single shot.\n\nThis one time, i ruined a full month of our DM's planning by blowing off the wing of a dracolich that made the terrible mistake of threatening Lom's friends before it could get away with a particular MacGuffin.  Another time I one-shot a middling Big Bad riding a 'Dwarvish Warmech', ending in one round a fight that was scheduled to take the entire session.\n\nHe was also super handy for carrying excess gear, doubled as the bestest most fastest \"CAN. RUN? MORE. YES?\" steed ever, was alarmingly good at Intimidation (he never actually understood that what he was doing and saying were intimidating things) and was totally happy waiting outside in the stables with the rest of the horses, should the barkeep or local lordship balk at the concept of an 9.3-foot tall mentally challenged centaur with a siege bow strapped to his back stomping around breaking everything.\n\nHe was always okay with just waiting.\n\nHe was extremely challenging to play and i fucking loved his stupid, smelly ass.\n\nA castle fell on him.\n\nIt was toward the end of a campaign that had gone on for over a year and a half, the details are pretty long and convoluted but the TL DR is that we'd just hit a *major* climactic point, the *real* Big Bad and had just revealed himself to us in a goddamned GoT-level double-cross *none* of us saw coming -in character or out - that left almost the entire party battered, mind-fucked and locked up in the dungeon of a collapsing castle.  \n\nAlmost the entire party.\n\nAlmost.\n\nLom was waiting outside.  \n\nIt was sheer luck that he happened to be close enough to a window to hear his very best friend - Asa Burrwick, a shifty-as-shit halfling rogue - screaming for him.  \n\nAsa, the only party member not incapacitated from a nightmarish psychic attack, tried to explain what was happening and couldn't because Lom simply could not grasp the concept of duplicity.  Asa tried for almost ten minutes to explain that 'The Shiny Man' - an Elvish lord who had been our primary employer and ally for almost the entire campaign - wasn't our friend after all and to absolutely no avail.  Lom simply didn't get it.\n\nIt was a gut wrenching conversation.  The castle is groaning and rumbling and starting to come down all around us and we are maybe ten rounds from horrible death and here's this cutthroat career criminal who has never cared about anyone but himself trying to explain through a metal grating to a monster with the mind of an infant that *sometimes people lie*\n\nand they do it because they want to hurt you.  \n\nLom never understood.  He refused to grasp that The Shiny Man wasn't big friend.\n\nAsa finally, finally managed to get through to Lom by telling him that unless he did something, all his friends were going to die.\n\nThat did it.  Lom blew through the wall like it wasn't even there - causing it to completely collapse behind him, barring that exit - and ripped open barbed steel cages, pulling the doors off their hinges or just yanking them up out of the floor and kicked out a foot-thick reinforced wooden door that would let the party escape.\n\nAlmost the entire party.\n\nAlmost.\n\nLom was just too fucking big to fit through the door.  \n\nHe couldn't kick through the stone in here.  Inside, it was too damn thick.  And the wreckage of the wall he'd come in through was pulling more and more stone down every moment.  Asa helped the rest of the party - who were severely fucked at that point - through the gaping hole where the door use to be, the walls shaking, floors cracking and collapsing, the whole fucking thing coming down and Lom just stood in the door, completely unable to fit through.\n\nTrapped.\n\nAsa came back for him.  He dodged falling masonry and nearly lost an entire leg to an exploding support beam but he came back, he grabbed Lom's hands and screamed at him, \"*FUCKING MOVE\"* screaming and crying and pounding his fists against the stone, trying to chip it away with his knives, *\"FUCKING MOVE YOU STUPID SHIT, YOU DUMB SACK OF SHIT MOVE\"*  Fucking bawling.    \n\nLom reached out and picked up Asa as gently as he could and said \"No.\"  He put Asa down so slowly, like the halfling was a soap bubble that could just burst if he moved too quickly.  \"I.  Wait.  *I wait.*\"\n\nAnd then the ceiling caved in. \n \n(I declined to roll for damages, our DM agreed to allow him to simply die instantly.)\n\nAsa barely got out alive.  \n\nThe rest of the party suffered varying degrees of horrible injury, but nothing that wouldn't heal, given time and judicious application of various Cures and Heals.  \n\nAnd then they set to picking apart and destroying everything 'The Shiny Man' held dear.\n\nThey didn't bother with justice.  \n\nFrom the moment Lom died, it was revenge.  \n\nOver the next seven months, they took apart his entire political, business and criminal empire, burned docks that held his ships, destroyed storehouses filled with his goods, destroyed his whorehouses and his opium dens, assassinated all of his political allies, systematically murdered anyone who'd ever done business with him, burned his mansion to the ground and waited outside, cutting down every single man and woman who tried to escape.\n\nAnd when they finally had The Shiny Man cornered, his fine silk clothes in tatters, his beautiful face bloodied and torn, his breath ragged and all trace of his sneering contempt and superiority replaced with stark terror, it was Asa who took that Elvish bastard's face in his hands and whispered *\"Lom is waiting for you,\"* before pushing the knife into his belly, all the way to the hilt.\n\nAnd then, just like that, the party broke apart.  They all went their separate ways.  Campaign over.  Party done.\n\nExcept for Asa.\n\nWho stayed to make sure that son of a bitch was dead.",

        "text": "I stood across from my former lover. I had fought ahead and had gotten to Samana's tower. Leaving my party and the army that had accompanied us behind. I didn't know what I was thinking honestly. Maybe I thought she would see me and revert back to the pretty reluctant young priestess I had known before. Maybe I wanted to try and save her, or maybe I wanted to kill her myself. Either way it didn't really matter since I knew she wasn't the same as she was before. I knew that as soon as I had seen her. The drow ideals that she had once shunned had finally poisoned her, as I had feared it might have.\n\"I was wondering when you would get here\", she said staring deeply into my eyes. \"Its been a long time Maryk.\" \"Too long apparently.\" I snapped. \"What the hell happened to you Sammi. You used to hate this bullshit, and look at you now. Leading an invasion to the surface.......\" Looking down I let out a resentful sigh. \"Your mother would be proud.\" Her eyes began to glow with anger, predictably she darted towards me, short sword drawn, screaming \"YOU WILL NOT SPEAK OF MY MOTHER!!\". I dodged to the right and dove behind her. Landing from my dive with a roll I swiftly threw 4 throwing knives in quick succession, but she had already sensed my move and with near supernatural grace and speed dodged my attack and quickly closed the gap between us. Sword in hand she began her assualt, jabbing and hacking at me. Dodging and ducking i unsheathed my dirks and began my assault. I parried her blow and kicked her hard in the shin, making a resounding crack and caused her to let out an earthshattering scream. I let my guard down, just for an instant, just long enough to hit me dead center with a push spell, I flew across the room, crashing into the wall, and knocking the breath out of me. She limped towards me as I gasped for breath, sword gripped tightly and murder in her eyes. She stood over me and smiled. \"Too bad, your son wanted to meet his father.\" she said. I gritted my teeth, anger fueled my body as I grabbed her ankle and pulled back with as much force as I could muster. She fell back fast and hard. Clinching my hands into a fist I lunged on top of her, and began punching her as hard and as many times as I can. \"WHERE\" CRACK \"IS\" CRACK \"MY\" CRACK \"FUCKING\" CRACK \"SON\"!!!!!!!!!!! My hands bloodied and her face bruised and broken, I clenched her throat turning her eyes to meet mine. \"ANSWER ME DAMN IT!!!!\" I screamed clenching tighter and tighter as each moment of her silence passed. She grunted, and simply said \"He's not here.... He's in the underdark... In Om'damora....\" I released her throat, and watched as she started to cry. \"I'm sorry...\" she sobbed \"I...\" \"Don't...... Just.. Don't.... Please.\"\nI rose from attop her and started walking towards the door, and when I turned to look back she was gone. Probably used a teleportation spell when I turned away. \"Goodbye Sammi..... I love you.\" Sitting against the corner cloaked a bruised and bloodied Samana whispered \"I love you too..\" trying to stop herself from crying again..... TOO BE CONTINUED",

When last I left off, it was with a gang of vaguely-sociopathic misfits piling into a car in various states of consciousness and then running over a creepy-as-shit Nicolas Cage vampire three times. Good stuff. Next up, the party tackles a mystery, complete with mysterious dissappearences!\n\nThe party today includes:\n\n* [Bullmime, avant-garde artist extraordinare. Hidden beneath that mime-crossed-with-a-bulldog exterior is a heart that beats with care and concern for her friends. Camps out in the bathroom of a burger joint, pays rent for it.](http://i.imgur.com/GPR6sZx.png)\n* [Lupusexpress, wolfwoman delivery girl who's devoted to her job. Occasionally chases red rubber balls and barks at cats.](http://i.imgur.com/uTafvow.png)\n* [Denial, the straight man who would very firmly like to believe that none of this is happening. Tries to stay afloat in a crazy-ass world.](http://i.imgur.com/1aw8O5g.jpg)\n* [Squidalibre, half-human-half-squid turned half-wolfman-half-squid. Close combat monster, tries to solve every problem with his fists instead of his brain.](http://i.imgur.com/EKy6nOn.jpg)\n* [Landlady, the perfectly ordinary lady whose sanity is starting to crack under the pressure of her weird-ass tennents (Squidalibre, Denial and Medstudent). Recently acquired a therapist girlfriend.](http://i.imgur.com/4Pax9qT.jpg)\n\nFade in on Lupusexpress preparing to deliver a package to a certain ninja burger when she notices the car is inhabited by a sentient sock. Yes, a sentient goddamn sock. Who, as it turns out, was hired to destroy Lupusexpress's car.\n\n\"Whatever, it's insured.\" She then drove at full speed into a brick wall, while triumphantly flaunting a power she had just purchased allowing her to ignore damage from vehicle crashes.\n\nThe sock, meanwhile, picked up the flaming car in its stubby, two-inch-long arms and hucked it at Lupusexpress's face. The two then proceeded to get lunch together. What. The sock then rolled to romance Lupusexpress. [Turbo success](http://i.imgur.com/AqKlRgd.png). [WHAT](http://i.imgur.com/wlZLeCL.png).\n\nAnyway. All of this was a flimsy prelude to the party's next goal- figuring out why all of the weird shit had suddenly dropped off, and started being replaced by vaguely spooky shit. Multiple party members thought they were being followed by something. Denial became very concerned after his cadre of *perfectly ordinary* friends began to drop off the face of the earth, with the remaining ones alluding to vague things hunting them while exuding high-octane panic. The gang war between gerbils and ninjas had screeched to a halt. Then, things came to a head when Lupusexpress's father went missing while he was getting groceries.\n\nThis flipped a seriously primal switch in Lupusexpress, and she immediately set out to round up her \"friends\". They all barreled off to the scene of the crime- the grocery store where Papadog was last seen. Taking advantage of how absurdly uncomfortable it was to talk with Lupusexpress (everyone thought she was a *really enthusiastic* furry), the party bullshitted their way into the building and scouted for clues. This proved boring, so they decided to look at the security tapes instead. When they found the employees-only door, Squidalibre promptly wrenched it off the hinges, not noticing that it was both unlocked and *a swinging door*. Thus drew the attention of the security guard in the camera room. Now, follow along, children. What is the appropriate response to this situation?\n\n* Run\n* Claim to be a carpenter\n* Say \"oops\"\n* Surprise inspection!\n* Ask friends for help\n* **LUCHA LIBRE**\n\n...And that's how Lupusexpress became a wrestling tag-team-partner and impromptu ballistic missile. The poor security guard was knocked out and thrown in front of Landlady, who started to flip her shit until Bullmime calmed her down by slapping a bottle of Jack Daniels in her hand and stuffing her into a shopping cart. Then taking a selfie.\n\nDenial then stepped up to bat and sifted through the various tapes, using his powers of enjoying boredom to speed up the investigation immensely. He found that Lupusexpress's father was kidnapped from the middle of the store by a nearly invisible assailant, and presumably taken to some sort of dungeon. Lupusexpress found the location and picked up her father's scent, following it outside (past two security guards, whom Bullmime ran over with the Landlady cart, while capturing the whole thing on video) and through a winding path that eventually led to a large warehouse district. Trouble was, there was an assload of warehouses. So, the party strolled over to the district manager and \"coerced\" him into helping (by letting Bullmime talk to him until he started fearing for his life). Denial once again stepped up into the role of Boring Paperwork Man, and quickly tracked down the suspicious warehouse whose owners had gone curiously unrecorded.\n\nDoing away with any silly concepts of stealth or caution, the whole party charged into the pitch-black warehouse, where they were ambushed. Denial was the first to get silently tased and dragged off, and Bullmime got lucky by unintentionally shining her phone's flashlight app into the face of a man wearing night-vision goggles. This all proved too much for Landlady, whose sanity finally gave under the pressure, and she assaulted one of the black-ops freaks with her teeth. Bullmime and Squidalibre joined forces into a sort of walking one-two punch, where Bullmime would blind a black ops guy and Squidalibre would beat the everloving shit out of the unfortunate victim. Lupusexpress, hearing her father further in, dashed on ahead to free him.\n\nThe fight was valiant. Denial even regained consciousness at a critical point to snatch the sniper rifle out of the hands of his captor and prevent the death/incapacitation of Bullmime. However, without Lupusexpress backing them up, Bullmime, Squidalibre and Landlady were eventually worn down and subdued by the assholes in jumpsuits with the zappy hands. Denial and Lupusexpress fled the scene. Denial ditched his shiny new sniper rifle in a random alley and tried to forget the entire night's events. Lupusexpress, meanwhile, had a tearful reunion with her father and asked what the whole business was about.\n\nWell, funny she should ask. See, those assholes in the jumpsuits were part of a secret organization called the Erasers, who were in charge of keeping human society in some semblance of normality. Their jobs consisted of tracking down non-humans who upset the status quo and confining them to the underground, where all the monsters and weirdos could live happily without freaking out the delicate humans. And now, the Erasers had captured three party members, two of which were \"normal\" humans, and one of which was so much of a freak that even pro wrestlers thought he was weird.\n\nWhich is why, on reflection, that it was not terribly smart for Squidalibre to start his prisoner debriefing by kicking his captor in the nards.\n\nLandlady and Bullmime were generally treated well by the shady government officials while their information was checked out. Squidalibre, for his crimes against normality and the squad commander's balls, was tied to a table and forced to listen to a continuous loop of What's New Pussycat while the squad commander implanted sixteen faulty quarantine chips into Squidalibre's face (and one working one). These chips would ensure that Squidalibre never returned to the surface, or (most of) the chips would explode. Then, the three of them were unceremoniously booted into the underground, one of the cities beneath the surface, and told not to cause any trouble. I don't know how I kept a straight face.",

Now for Chapter One:  \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOur heros are in their shared hotel room. Silver Suertes is reading from his codex (not related to mine, the codex is a common spellbook also) in the corner of the room, while I’m brushing his teeth. The curtains are drawn over the window, but it is obviously noon. Both characters are still in their pajamas, but Suertes also has his coat on. The room is in complete disarray—the nightstand is piled high with books and still-smoking candles, and there are miscellaneous magical symbols strewn on the wallpaper. Yet despite all the chaos, our bags are packed—they’ve got a meeting in another town that they don’t want to miss. Fi is one room over, sleeping. She came only with the clothes on her back and her trusty Briefcase. Ælvis is already in the other town (he couldn’t make it to the first session).\n\nAs the city began to wake up, the players began their morning routine—a chaotic bustle to make breakfast and get out of the house. While I was taking inventory, Silver Suertes woke up Fi and ended up critting a roll to make toast (It should be noted that the crit officially made toast the universal symbol of friendship and trust. Didn’t really affect the campaign other than the constant toast greetings). As they’re about to leave the hotel, they notice that there’s a bit of statuary maintenance going on in front of the door—it’s blocked by a bust of Ben Stiller (the DM is truly the most refined form of Problem Sleuth trash) As Silver and I attempt to right the situation, Fi breaks the window at the other end of the room. The group decides that what’s done is done, and that it would be better to head down the fire escape. At the bottom, there’s a risky jump, but all players make it out okay. \n\nThe group is now standing on the curb, waiting for a taxi. I try to seduce the nearest driver into stopping for the group, but my “hideous man-ankles” end up doing quite the opposite. Meanwhile, Suertes hails a different cab and the group makes it to the airport. Unfortunately, when they arrive, they find that their flight left more than two hours ago! However, the group does manage to charm an attendant into making an exception: the group is good to go. \n\nIn the shining international terminal of the airport, the group discusses moonshine, eats sandwiches, and gets harassed by an angry police officer. Life is good. As the group boards the flying ferret (big WTF at the DM there, apparently magical flying ferrets are airplanes in this setting) heading for Europe, I knit a fine pair of gloves. Silver Suertes complains about the in-flight meal, and Fi simply watches from the back. The flight goes for a long while without a hitch, and the group gets off safely. The walk to their inn is only about seven blocks from the airport, so the group decides that it might be best to retire for the night. \n\n[DM’s Note: There are normal planes too.]",

        "text": "Hello Reddit! I am here to tell you the (still ongoing) tale of a group of heros who managed to screw up the universe in unimaginable ways. Before I tell you this tale, you should know that this is a custom setting that the DM and I built from the ground up. It could be compared to a crossbreed between 3.5e and 5e D&amp;D. Set in prohibition era, it began as a Problem Sleuth knockoff and became something way, way more. The stats are slightly different from normal D&amp;D, and consist of:\n\nPulchritude: Basically charisma. \n\nVim: Basically strength.\n\nIntelligence: Typical intelligence stat.\n\nVisualisation: Spell casting stat, typically the dump stat for melee characters.\n\nDexterity: Typical dexterity\n\nConstitution: Physical and Mental fortitude (Save against poison and madness and such)\n\nThis combined with basic health stats creates our characters. Speaking of which, our main characters are:\n\nAharoni “Wingding” Corsiva: My character, whose unoriginal name came from 3 fonts I thought fit together (Though my DM would disagree). His class is Inspector, a primarily spell-casting class. He was born into a wealthy family of High Elves and took up his parents’ business when they died in a mysterious house fire along with his baby sister. He took the last remaining artifact of his family’s life, a magical codex containing everything his family had learned about the world (This is basically the Wikipedia of monsters that only my character can use due to it being bound to those in his bloodline. Helps when we see some sort of abomination and want to know what we’re looking at). It should be also noted that High Elves in our setting have assorted mutations, though are still regarded as highly beautiful for some unknown reason. This becomes a running joke later. Anyways, during his travels, he met…\n\nSilver Suerte: A friend’s character, and probably the “That Guy” of the session… in a way. Remains quiet for the most part except in combat or when it involves alcohol. Also he the most god-damned anime character in existence. His character is an absolute clusterfuck of god knows what. He is the most discriminated against, being a Night Elf (modified drow class, more monstrous), and has an obsession with brewing during the *prohibition era* (The DM would like to point out, though, that even during the prohibition era, brewing liquor wasn’t all too uncommon). He plays a sorcerer, which is the most magically gifted class, but prefers using a longsword because of his relatively solid vim stat. Muscle Wizard much? Along with him, we have…\n\nÆlvis Dumbledoor: Another good friends character, with an even more original name than me. He doesn’t show up for many campaigns due to a busy schedule, but is cool when he is around. He plays an Oceanid (cough cough zora cough cough) professor who joined us for a research project. Hasn’t been in combat much but can use a special magic that is only available to fish people like him. Lastly, we have…\n\nFi: A wood elf with the sleuth background who only showed up for the first session. She was supposed to have been following us because she thought we were engaging in criminal activity, but we befriended her and she joined us for a short time.\n\nAnd that’s our cast of misfit idiots who bumble around in the world our DM created. Let me know if you’re interested. I quite like this session, and have a great many stories to tell about it.",

        "text": "So, I'm playing D&amp;D 5e with 4 new players, and they're having a blast with all of the RP that can be had. That being said, I figured I'd throw a doppelganger their way to see how they deal with it.\n\nThe story starts with the party, consisting of a bard, druid, barbarian, rogue, and sorcerer, arriving to a new town that praises Avandra over the other gods for various reasons. Anyway, the elven druid took the gnome sorcerer's bag of holding (which he used to earlier steal from the party before they saw loot) and held it away from him while lecturing him. This went on for a little bit, so I decided to keep things moving with a thief running by and snatching the bag of holding, giving a good opportunity to introduce chases to them. The dragonborn barbarian manages to catch and knock the thief out, revealing a note that fell out of the thief's cloak. The note simply had an amount of gold written on it with the name \"Raito\". The druid uses manacles to bind together the thief's left arm to his right leg behind his back so that the barbarian can \"wear\" him like a purse! The druid then changes into a bloodhound to follow the scent on a note the thief dropped.\n\nThe party immediately moves towards the town's chapel with the bard convincing everyone on the way not to be alerted by the thief-purse. Upon arriving, they immediately see the head priest and begin interrogating him without being too offensive as the druid, still in dog form, is circling the man and making absolutely sure that the scents match. The barbarian asks if the priest knows the thief to which he denies. The group moves into the chapel at the priests request, and the druid changes back to humanoid form, startling the priest drastically (low magic campaign) who then screamed demon and ran towards his room in the back for some holy tools. The druid immediately takes chase and locks himself in the back room with the priest while the party keeps the acolytes in the main hall in place. The druid nearly kills the priest through interrogation methods based on strangling, and with a high insight roll, determines that the priest truly knows nothing but claims that the situation is very suspicious. \n\nFast-forward a few hours, the party has managed to move the thief into an inn room with the bard explaining that the man passed out from a drinking contest with the dragonborn. Before the thief becomes conscious, the gnome sorcerer decides to search for magical auras in the inn. It's an interesting idea to play with, so I tell him that he senses magic coming from down the hallway. He moves forward and peeks through the keyhole to see a woman practicing illusion spells. Now, the gnome sorcerer, pulling one of his normal stunts, decides to use mage hand to grab her butt and flee. She storms out and yells at the gnome before returning to her room. Little did the players know that I had decided to make her the doppelganger they were after who was practicing illusion magic to avoid the need for stealing someone's clothes to impersonate them. \n\nThe thief awakens in the room and explains that the head priest had given him the note to remind him of his debt and identified him by name. The thief went on to tell that his wife was killed and daughter kidnapped to ensure his repayment. Throughout the conversation, this terrified (crazy intimidate rolls) thief was constantly looking for a way to flee, so the druid ended up getting very impatient and had the barbarian slay him on the spot after believing that the priest had tricked the group earlier somehow. The party returns to the chapel at night where the rogue breaks in and spreads oil EVERYWHERE. As dawn broke and the very moment the dragonborn saw the priests entering the main hall from their chambers, he sets the thief's body (he was decapitated earlier) on fire and throws it into the chapel screaming, \"Do you recognize him now?!\" \n\n... The party never did find out that the doppelganger was stealing the priest's clothing to conduct his business. Nope, they instead turned a holy building into a giant blaze. ",

        "text": "*I'm playing Pathfinders DM-ed by the hilarious [113420](http://www.reddit.com/user/113420)  and currently in this world, it is winter. No one wants to deal with all the cold weather rules. SO! What does our DM do? He has quick one-on-one sessions to play out what we did over the \"winter break\"! Beyond hiring gnomes to fix our cart up and giving the boss naga lady a heated stone floor around her desk, my character Pratena ([A multi-classing cyclops who is currently 9 feet tall](http://sta.sh/01r9i2mnc44c) ) heard about Storm Giants! Giants that can literally punch with the weather. So then, with diary in her bag, she made her way to find them and learn how to punch with storms. Below is her travels...*\n\n**//this diary has been spell checked for the purpose of not having Non-Orcs try to read Orc spelling//**\n\nDear Diary,\n\nToday I head out to find the Storm Giants! I heard they can punch with a storm and I want to learn that! After talking with Valera and the Mana I found out a good place I can go to find them. It will be a long trip, and my ring has run out of battery so I will need to hunt on my way over at least. I think I will train and not use it my whole trip. Learn to hunt again. I have spent too long not doing it. So today I will pack and head out! I think if I find anything nice I’ll take it home. I’ll keep writing in here to talk about my travels of course, I like to look back into this.\nPratena\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-Day one\nI was walking today on my way, and not even looking for it I found a Hydra! It was weird though. It was on fire and frozen at the same time. I think it was in a lot of pain. I decided it needed to be put down. I now had at least two days of food.\n\n-Day two\nI couldn’t find food, but I had hyrda! The scenery was pretty. It was also cold. Good thing I have this winter mono-goggle, it keeps my eye from getting hurt.\n\n-Day three\nFound nothing. Ran out of food. I need more.\n\n-Day four\nI found some dens and managed to find a bear. It wasn’t enough for the whole day but it was something right?\n\n-Day five\nCame across a bunch of mountains with trees. I managed to scavenge for tiny animals. lots of snacking.\n\n-Day six\nFound a lighthouse in the middle of land. I decided not to go and go hunting. I was too hungry to explore.\n\n-Day seven\nI ran into bandits! They tried to jump me. I was too hungry to care who they were…one tasted funny though, maybe he was a clown?\n\n-Day eight\nToday I found cat human things. They seemed very nice and curious. They had no food since there was a famine, but they did let me stay the night. They were fun, I could make them chase lights. They wanted to keep sticking their hands in my mouth.\n\n-Day nine\nI found a big temple from the cat people pointing out where I might have been able to hunt. It had a big monster in it. I decided to deal with it. It was delicious.\n\n-Day ten\nI found a path covered in weapons. Obvious bandit stuff. I found more Asshole patrol people! They came from the southern branch. They pointed me in the way of more edibles. Found a HUGE snake monster! I decided it was too big. I now have a LOT of snake meat.\n\n-Day eleven\nI find a lot more food this day on my way to the giants. It was a good break between snake meat. I would sometimes think of Valera eating the snake, I felt weird after that for a while.\n\n-Day twelve\nI FOUND THE GIANTS! They were super eager to teach me how to punch!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDear Diary,\n\nSo after a few days I found out that this town is called Typhus. Everyone living here is a Storm Giant. They want to see if I’m actually capable of learning their power without abusing it so they are letting me stay with them for a while. I get to stay with one named Cloudmane. I think it’s because of his hair, it looks like a puffy cloud! I heard some call him Cloudmaim. I wonder why.\n\nThe first few days was learning what chores I was assigned. They don’t use currency because they share everything. I can see why as they explained their life. I wouldn’t want to worry about money if I lived as short as they did. I got assigned to fish and help the bar. I didn’t know how to fish though, but Cloudmane showed me! The bar though was very easy since I helped with the one in Townorc back home, the bottle and glasses were just a lot larger.\n\nI was given the name \"Little Piranha\" as well. I think it's because I'll eat anything they give me, and any bones if I don't eat them are picked completely clean by the time I'm done with it. I don't think they've met a cyclops before me. That's okay I like the name, it's a lot more imaginative then back at Townorc. I'm starting to miss home and Asshole Patrol. \n\nLittle Piranha (Pratena)\n\n——-\n\nDiary,\n\nFishing has been fun! Lots of whale wrestling, and I never knew I could find something that ate more then I do. few nights ago I earned my right to train and learn how to use the power of storms. I never knew how Orc-like they were till recently. They’re very happy but turn on a dime to wildly violent. It’s like watching living thunderstorms.\n\nAnyways, I earned my rights at the bar. I was hanging out with Cloudmane there and sitting on one of the tables since I was too short for the chairs. A big fight broke out and Cloudmane joined in so I was told to just sit tight and stay safe. I lost my temper when one took a swing at me and I punched him clear across the room. I really didn’t mean to but, after thinking I was royally screwed since they all fell silent and stared at me for the five knows how long, they picked me up and started cheering! I was really scared but really excited at the same time. Was that just a near death experience I had? Is that what it feels like?\n\nPratena\n\n———-\n\nDiary,\n\nTraining to use storms is HARD. I’m really tired but it’s been worth it. I can’t quite punch with them yet, but I can now make my own small thunder clouds! I think I’m making them really proud with my progress. If not it’s hard to tell because every lesson ends with cheers and drinks at the bar. They are excited I can hold my own in there so they don’t have to worry about hurting me. Well, one did accidentally fall on me, but I wasn’t too hurt! I think he was more scared then I was hurt.\n\nI was starting to feel really homesick a few nights back. I think they could tell. I have been talking non-stop about my life in Townorc. They seemed very interested and liked how orcs lived their lives to the fullest. Though I guess I’ve been seeming sadder, the other night one of them approached me before I went into Cloudmane’s place to go to bed and he gave me something a few of them worked on for me. It was their attempt at a doll of an Orc. It looked more like a sewn voodoo doll with a toy axe and button eyes but I love it all the same. It was probably the smallest thing they ever tried to make, but it’s the perfect size for me. I hope I didn’t crush his leg when I gave him that hug in thanks, I think I saw him wince. I don’t think I can go to bed anymore without it.\n\nI leave tomorrow for home though, and I’ll be taking this and all my knowledge with me. I think I’m gonna miss this place. I will definitely be visiting again. I hope I do them all proud while I’m gone.\n\nPratena\n\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n-Day one back\nOne my way back home! Cloudmane gave me a day’s worth of food and drink to give me a headstart. He said I did really well! Better then the last guy who came to learn this. I hope I do them proud and see them again. I would love to spend more time there. I need to get home though so I wish them luck as they wished me luck! I’ll think about them every time I see a thunder storm.\n\nI found a Swamp monster on the way home this day too, I decided to take it down and eat it. It was salty, I love salty things so I’m happy.\n\n-Day two back\nRan into the Asshole Patrol guys again! They needed help with bandits, so I helped. I was hungry too. They didn’t need to clean up the bandits’ messes there. They didn’t ask me either so all was good. I went on my way after bidding them farewell.\n\n-Day three back\nNot a good hunting day, I found just a deer. I kept the antlers. It was a Twelve point Buck.\n\n-Day four back\nI found small traveling groups, I traded gold and stuff I got from fighting the bandits for food and water. That was an easy day.\n\n-Day five back\nI found these really pretty big cats, I WAS gonna leave them alone but I was so hungry, I took them down and took their prey. Valera may like their fur, so I made sure to save the pelts.\n\n-Day six back\nI ran into a small army group. They ran when they saw me. I followed them.\n\n-Day seven back\nLots of frozen dead things. Ate just the animals. They ran into a nation and I don’t wanna deal with that. Decided to keep going home.\n\n-Day eight back\nI found this big ugly monster thing. No idea what it was. I killed it. It tasted as ugly as it looked.\n\n-Day nine back\nI found nothing today, I got snowed over. Made myself a little hole and stayed there till the snow storm died down. I ate the rest of my rations.\n\n-Day ten back\nStorm passed and I dug myself out. I found bandits as I went on. The place I noticed was where a mission from Valera was we put aside for a while. I decided to take care of it now. I’ll tell Valera later. They helped me not starve.\n\n-Day eleven back\nI found those robed people from the woods. They tried to attack me. I was hungry. I’ll leave it there.\n\n-Day twelve back\nWandered into Rockdust Lake. I got stuck here for 10 days. Had no time to write. Lots of fighting, lots of uprisings…I think I killed some “kings” or leaders… whatever I did I left with some neat crowns and awesome battle scars!\n\n-Day thirteen back\nI made it home after some hunting! brought home a lot of food to help the base out with feeding Carch and Hurtle. I am going back to using my ring for now so I don’t have to eat for two months. I had a lot of fun but it’s good to be back. I hope there wasn’t too much trouble while I was gone. ",

        "text": "For those of you who have read my previous posts, you already know the party composition for the campaign a friend of mine and I Co-DM. Just in case you need some brushing up, here is a link to my first post. \n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/30iqf0/35_the_god_king_of_the_north_in_the_south/\n\nAnyway, this is pertaining once again to the crazy wizard Griffin.\n\nAt this point, Griffin has shown that, even though he's an absolute nutball, he is by far the most perceptive and sometimes the most intelligent member of the party. All of his craziness is actually calculated and planned to place people off guard so he can more easily befriend them, or in cases of bad guys, defeat them. He's become the sort of defacto leader. \n\nHis backstory is quite interesting as well. He is the eldest member of one of the Great Houses of a secluded and highly magical island nation of Grey Elves which essentially means he is royalty (which very much surprised the other members when they discovered this). He left his homeland in the care of his younger brother in search of knowledge and adventure. 150 years before the formation of the party, he found a minor artifact. A powerful book that allows him to create an extra dimensional study and allows the book to emulate any book within the study (he uses this as basically an infinite page spellbook as he can simply leave all of his spell books in the study and emulate them from the outside) it also gives him a bonus to knowledge checks. Nothing too OP but still interesting. The best part, it split his soul when he found it. He had this idea where his \"normal\" alignment is  Chaotic Good but occasionally, the book gives power to the other part of his soul which has turned Lawful Evil. We've had some fun with that.\n\nHis nephew (the samurai warrior I mentioned in my previous post) Is the adopted son of Griffin's brother who found him mysteriously abandoned in the streets and took him in (Much to the chagrin of his irritatingly snobby wife). Young Talon (only 150 years old which is young for elves) has been traveling with the party for well over a year of in game time when he finally reasserts his original mission, to find and retrieve Griffin and bring him home to deal with his responsibilities. Griffin's brother was dead and His house needed a leader.\n\nThe party saddles up in their newly acquired skyship and flies top speed for the island. When they arrive, they are met with disdain as the Grey Elves are typically very against having other races in their homeland. At this point I should also mention that the party's Elf rogue has left and was replaced by a shadowswyft rogue named Kyne.\n\nAnyway, a political shitstorm ensues and Griffin has to abandon his typical carefree attitude to try and deal with it. Eventually, in an attempt to gain influence through renown, Griffin decides to try and reclaim what is called The Repository. A vault of all Grey Elf knowledge that was sealed against them after a Drow raid from the underdark. After a few fights and a bunch of puzzles, they make it to the inner library. Books everywhere, but their guide reveals that they are mostly decoys and traps. The real Repository is in a hidden chamber, a large magical tome written by Boccob himself and blessed by Correlon that records all of Elf history.\n\nThis book accepts a gift of knowledge from Griffin and offers him knowledge in return. Before now, Griffin never knew about his alter ego and refused to believe it when someone told him otherwise. The Repository first informs him that his soul was split, which leaves him concerned, but not surprised. This is where I started to F*** with his story though.\n\nGriffin: Is there anyway to reforge my soul completely? \n\nRepository: You may merge the two parts within you, but the third part is too far gone.\n\nGriffin: Third part.... what are you talking about?!\n\nRepository: When you found the book, it split your soul /THREE/ ways. The first two I have already explained. The third was trapped in a powerful receptacle, given new life, and transported away by foreign powers.\n\nGriffin: Are you saying there's another... another me walking around out there?!\n\nRepository: I believe you already know the answer.\n\nHe looked at me with this \"What is happening, I don't remember putting this in my story\" look before I dropped the bomb.\n\nRepository: How long ago did you find the artifact, Griffin?\n\nGriffin: Why, it was 150 years ago. But what-\n\nRepository: And how old..... is your nephew, Griffin?\n\nDead silence around the table. He's totally shell shocked, everyone has so much surprise in their eyes as they look at me and process what I just said.\n\nRepository: Talon is not your adopted nephew, Griffin Dawntracker. Talon /is/ you.\n\nNobody speaks for a full 5 minutes. Talon collapsed to the floor of the tomb in shock. Griffin is calculating and spouting magical gibberish, trying to see if it's possible. Finally, the alcoholic sorcerer speaks up and breaks the tension.\n\nMerrick: So... what happens if I call you Griffin Jr?\n\nTalon:...... (Stands up, tries to regain composure) I will hunt you down, and gut you like a pig. ",

        "text": "I've battled my way through the daemon hordes of the Chaos god \"Finals Week\" to submit the next part in my party's Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay campaign. This one is quite long, and it sees the party traveling to a fetid swamp to find lost magisters and fragments of history. And some real combat for once! A quick summary of the characters involved, more detailed biographies in Part 1, which I'm sure the bot will link in the comments.\n\nVebur Skullhammer, Dwarf Troll Slayer\n\nSwearing the slayer oath to die in battle after breaking the dwarven code of honor, Vebur is with the caravan following the path of his ancestor, who traveled to Araby centuries ago. And he might find some terrible monster to slay him along the way - unfortunately for him, dwarves are psychologically incapable of fighting to lose.\n\nAxel Muffins, Halfling Fieldwarden\n\nAxel was formerly part of a tight-knit group of scouts in the halfling homeland. His group was nearly destroyed by an encounter with the necromancer Dramesh. Axel, the only survivor, joined the caravan in search of new beginnings.\n\nRigg D'Elvagar, Human Tradesman\n\nRigg is a middle-aged man who grew up in a small village in the northern human Empire. Realizing he had reached his life's halfway point with nothing to show for it, Rigg apprenticed to an engineer by the name of Gregor Friemann, the caravan's resident technical expert.\n\nHelden Rommstagg, Human Apprentice Wizard\n\nHelden is a wizard who channels one of the eight winds of magic. His wind of choice is Shyish, the wind of death. As the senior apprentice of the Amethyst College, he was sent to investigate the disappearance of another Amethyst Magister by the name of Ludevicus, who vanished hunting down Dramesh.\n\nNikkel Roklept, Human Grave Robber\n\nBorn a peasant in the Empire, Nikkel's life was changed forever when his father abandoned the Roklept family, leaving behind a chest containing a stack of encrypted maps and a decoding tool, encoded in an unknown language. Nikkel was able to figure out that his father had headed in the direction of Araby, and joined the caravan to pursue the mystery.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Adventure 3: Bloody Days at Barak Varr**\n\nThe prospect of negotiating with dwarves was in fact so formidable that the party opted to let the more diplomatic members of the caravan handle it. They set their sights on the small port market and some well-deserved rest and recuperation. While Marcus handled the task of trading the caravan's goods for profit and arranging passage to Araby by sea, the party spent the following days left to their own devices. Surprisingly, they managed to avoid bloodshed.\n\n*Some downtime, with the party eager to exploit the fact they were in one of the more varied markets of the Old World to actually buy some stuff while it was available.*\n\nVebur was shocked to see a throng of slayers milling around the port-side taverns. Correctly identifying them as the legendary crew of Long Drong the Slayer Pirate, he boarded their ship to have a drink with the infamous dwarf. Drong welcomed the young slayer with open arms, and in between rounds of drinking Vebur under the table, the Slayer Pirate imparted ancient words of Dwarven wisdom. Or alcoholic babble. The two things are oft confused. After recovering from his hangover, and with even more motivation to fulfill his oaths, Vebur sought the library of Barak Varr for information on his ancestor. Poring over dusty human journals and ancient dwarven history-tablets, he found a few scant clues suggesting that Verrick was consumed by an awesome fervor, raving about some great edifice built by the gods themselves buried beneath the desert in a foreign land...\n\n*Long Drong comes straight from Warhammer lore. Slayer pirates, too good not to throw in.*\n\nRigg, with the help of Gregor, collected the necessary parts from the dwarven marketplace to begin building a rifle, and set about the task of putting the weapon together, aided by the master engineer's keen eye. In between long hours of assembling the rifle, Gregor began training Rigg on the finer points of firearm marksmanship.\n\nAxel collected the suit of mail Anastasia had promised him, and found a skilled dwarf blacksmith who claimed to be able to resize it to fit him. However, the surly dwarf made it clear that this wouldn't be easy or quick, and collected a large payment of gold pieces in exchange for a promise to come back in a month.\n\nNikkel, searching for a quality set of thieves tools, found his efforts stymied by the honorable contents of the dwarf market. Almost ready to give up the search, he stumbled across a merchant going by the name of Skeevy Pete, cloistered away at the end of the harbor. Pete sold Nikkel the tools he was looking for before absconding on a battered dinghy.\n\n*A bit of a silly plot device to get Nikkel what he would need to move into his next career. Skeevy Pete ended up a recurring star in our group, and he's showed up in various forms in other campaigns on his apparently extra-dimensional dinghy.*\n\nHelden divided his time between searching for any nearby indicators of necromantic activity and checking in on the girl he had saved from the ravaged town. While she was still nearly mute with shock, he was able to coax a name out of her-Catarina, or Cat for short. A week after his arrival in Barak Varr, he received word from the Amethyst College. Magister Ludevicus, after a year of silence, had made his presence known through a ritual. The message was disjointed and garbled after traveling the Winds of Magic to Altdorf, but it was clear he was somewhere in the Bloodmire, a swamp about a week's travel south of Barak Varr.\n\nThe party agreed to travel with Helden to find Ludevicus, given that the ship the caravan had booked passage on wasn't bound to depart for another month, and Marcus still had to arrange for the sale or storage of the wagons and horses. They gathered supplies for the road, borrowed steeds from the caravan, and set out for the Bloodmire. For the first several days, their path mirrored that of the undead legion, until the party came across a crossroads. The footsteps of the dead led further into the heart of the Badlands, while the path to the Bloodmire went towards the coast. Thankful not to be following the necromancer's army, the party continued on their original path.\n\nWith each passing sunrise, the scenery grew bleaker and more desolate, eventually giving way from rock and scrub to a massive bog. In the distance, a thicket of trees stretched miles in either direction- the heart of the Bloodmire. As the party traveled further through the swamp, the reason behind its name became clear-the marsh water gradually took on a shade of deep crimson that stained skin and clothes. Reassurances that it was just some kind of plant life in the water fell on deaf ears as the party passed below the canopy and the shadows grew longer. Helden's witchsight saw lingering, atrophied dark magic from centuries past pooling in the shadows, along with more recent workings of Dhar and Shyish leading deeper into the swamp. Necromantic activity. Perhaps the reason Magister Ludevicus was here- Amethyst magisters are sworn to combat the undead wherever they arise.\n\nFollowing a barely visible path of cracked and sinking cobbles, the companions came to a village built on stilts, nestled between the trees. Suddenly faced with a thicket of spear and arrowheads as the natives of the swamp emerged from the trees, the party’s hands flew to their weapons and they prepared for a fight. Before battle could be joined, the village elder emerged, inquiring in shaky Reikspiel as to what the outsiders wanted in the swamp. After being told of their search for Ludevicus, the elder commanded his tribesmen put down their weapons. Apparently, Ludevicus had become something of a friend to the swamp people, helping them repel attacks by undead. He had disappeared into the swamp months ago, following the reemergence of a Dark witch from the tribes’ old stories-the Hag of the Bloodmire. The elder directed the party further into the swamp, towards a place called the Field of Bones, Ludevicus’ last known destination. The party wasted no time in setting out, after one last warning by the village elder to stay clear of the ancient black obelisk in the center of the swamp.\n\n*I tried my best to portray how creepy the Bloodmire was, and the insular nature of the native tribe.The grimdark never ends. Witchsight continues to be a useful tool for this kind of thing.*\n\nAfter wading through the swamp for an hour, the party stumbled another group of “travelers”- a Greenskin war party, presumably scouts from the nearby Waaagh! The small group of Orcs charged forward as the goblins ran into the tree line, readying crude bows and spears. The battle was short and brutal, as the party struggled for their lives and true blood joined the red waters of the Bloodmire. Axel vanished into the tree line as well, hurling sling bullets at the goblin bowmen. Helden scourged the Orcs with the Wind of Death, sending bolts that drained life energy. Nikkel found himself wounded and harried by one of the Orcs, climbing into a tree to escape. Rigg supported the companions with well-placed crossbow bolts. And Vebur charged into the thick of battle, bellowing dwarven war cries. After a savage melee, he took down the leader of the Orcs with a crushing hammer blow. Turning to lay waste to the lesser greenskins, he was blindsided by a goblin spearman that carved a furrow in his scalp, sending the Troll Slayer to his knees in the brackish swamp. The party rushed to his aid before the goblins could finish him off, and routed the remainder of the greenskins. \n\n*The Orcs from Pentus coming back, for the first big combat since the first session. I think the party had forgotten how lethal combat could be. Fortunately for most of the party, goblins have crap accuracy and most of them were only lightly wounded. Vebur, however, after losing a lot of wounds fighting the boss orc, was critically hit and almost killed by a lowly spear gobbo. The poor goblin's triumph was cut short as the rest of the party ran to save Vebur and patched him up a bit.*\n\nThe group briefly considered turning back, but only Vebur was heavily wounded, and he insisted he was fine. Trusting the dwarf’s toughness, the party continued towards the Field of Bones. Upon arriving, they discovered the reason for its name- a field of petrified skeletons stood in the clearing, crumbling stone covering limbs that still clutched weapons. Helden, with his witchsight, determined that these were the victims of a truly powerful spell- and an ancient one. By his vague estimation, the magic that had done this was cast hundreds of years ago at the earliest. While looking through the clearing for any sign of Ludevicus, Helden felt a sudden pulse of necromantic energy roll out from the center of the swamp. Dark magic abruptly flared to life in a half-dozen of the skeletons, stone crumbling off of them as they advanced with their rusted blades. The party rushed to ready weapons for the second time that day, and fell upon the skeletons. They proved less able foes than the greenskins, their skill at battle decayed by death and centuries, and the party quickly gained the upper hand, destroying the Undead and suffering only minor wounds. The party moved on before another wave of black magic could reanimate more of the corpses.\n\n*Skeletons also have crap accuracy, and the party's luck held out. Just a few scraches suffered.*\n\nNearby the Field of Bones, the party found a decaying stone watchtower, a relic from the old Mourkain Empire. Inside, they found a bedroll, some charms of Amethyst magic, and a map hastily scratched into the wall. The map indicated that Ludevicus was investigating some Mourkain ruins on the other side of the swamp, but his small camp had been abandoned for several months. The party set out again to traverse the Bloodmire, fighting a growing sense of unease as waves of malevolent energy continued to roil out from the heart of the Bloodmire. The party members trained in woodcraft led their group around patrols of orcs, and walking corpses steadily advancing inwards. Soon, they came across a strange hut, seemingly carved from petrified wood and surrounded by a fence of wrought bone. Axel recklessly advanced, and before Helden could warn him of the weave of Dark and Grey magic surrounding the cottage, the fence exploded in a shower of skeletal splinters as the hut dissolved into mist. The halfling’s leather armor managed to absorb the worst of the blow, but the wounds were serious and would need medical attention. The bleeding was inexpertly staunched, and the group continued on the trail of Ludevicus. \n\n*Grey magic, the wind of* Ulgu*, is the magic of shadows and illusion and mind magic, which Axel learned to his chagrin. I rolled low enough for damage that Axel stayed standing with a couple of wounds left, as I recall.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd I'm at a good point to stop before running up on the character limit.

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/37chlp/the_tale_of_the_elven_barmaid_and_the_murderhappy/",
        "text": "My first campaign had an elven barmaid as the first quest giver. The quest was simple, there's a patron at the bar that's hassling her and she's afraid to leave the tavern. The plan was to have them talk to the patron, convince him to come to terms with his wife's death, and move on from harassing the barmaid. Unfortunately, our paladin missed the subtext and went into full white knight mode, opening the conversation with a gauntleted fist to the mans jaw. A minute later, the Druids dog has torn his leg off, our \"Bearman\" Mage (replacement for orcs in this setting, since one of the players wanted to be a bear and I let him haha) had burned him to a crisp with fire Magic, and the rogue is disposing of the body in the canals. Jesus, good start.\n\nThe second quest from the barmaid was a little more complicated. \"Retrieve my fathers ancestral amulet from the nearby kobold infested elven cairn.\" Except the paladin kept flirting with the barmaid, which was hilarious to be fair, but I could see it getting irritating if everyone started doing it. So I hatched a plan. A devious devious plan.\n\nThey fought their way through the kobold infested cairn, fight a huge kobold leader, get through a trap filled corridor, and finally reach the cairn room. They spend some time worrying about ghosts, before I tell them they hear nothing but the wind wailing through the corridors. Fearing elven spirits, they carefully start disassembling the cairn before grabbing the small, dull amulet. To its side however, is a shield.\n\nThis shield was incredible. Probably about L10 or so when the party was L1. Massively overpowered, the paladin grabbed it and murdered every kobold on the way out with ease, when they had had to be tactical before. A few of the other more experienced players raised their eyebrows at me, assuming I was just being a noob dm, asking to check it for curses, etc. They found nothing, and I convinced them to keep playing. We had a break at this point and I explained to the most concerned one that all was not as it seemed, but not to tell the others.\n\nWhen we next met up a week or so later we started by heading back to town and handing in the quest. The paladin was flirting again now, but instead of saying \"the barmaid feels uncomfortable\" or whatever I played along. He handed her the amulet and she winked at him, leading him into the back room. He walked in backwards, giving two thumbs up to the party.\n\nThings start getting on, and she reaches over to take off his helmet. In the same movement, she grabs a cleaver from the bedside table and swings at the Paladins face, rolling high (17-19 iirc) whilst he rolls low, and slashes his face open before grabbing the massively OP shield from him and activating a teleportation spell, disappearing in a puff of smoke. Hearing nothing but screams the party decide to give him a minute, before realising that those aren't normal sex noises.\n\nThey kick the door down, and find the paladin clutching at his bleeding face. The Druid heals him, but he's left with a pretty gnarly scar. To make this better, the party had agreed that they would have to RP injuries, so a broken jaw would make it hard to talk, damaged leg meant they had to limp to get a beer, etc. The paladin had a huge scar drawn on his face in red dry eraser for the next few sessions, until the joke wore thin and we forgot to keep doing it. It was hilarious though.\n\nAnyway, they decide to go to the captain of the guard, and whilst the paladin nearly lost an eye he's more concerned that he lost his super OP shield. The captain informs them that they had been investigating reports of a thief/murderer in the region, and had sent their best investigator to figure it out. He told them this investigator normally spent his evenings sat at the bar in the tavern. They're just about to go and find him before the Mage, out of character, asks; \"Wait, didn't we kill that guy?\"\n\nThe realisation kicks in that they had been played from the start. I explained that after the barmaid saw how they 'expertly' dealt with the drunk she realised they were the perfect idiots to do her job for her, stealing a worthless amulet and a hugely valuable shield for her. If she had asked for the shield then they would've been hesitant to return it, but a worthless amulet given to all elves when they're buried was the perfect cover for it. The patron wasn't even that drunk, and definitely wasn't harassing the staff - he was just enjoying a quiet drink after a long day of thief hunting.\n\nThey couldn't tell the guard captain what had happened, as they would be admitting to murdering one of his best men. They decided to flee the capital, however the guards had witnesses who testified that the party had killed the investigators. The party was declared outlaws in the capital region, and spent the rest of the game trying to clear their name and catch the new big bad, known only as \"The Barmaid.\"\n\nNot only did she fool the party into doing her job for her, she covered her own tracks by convincing a group of well meaning idiots to kill the person in charge of hunting her down. Not only that, but they in turn became the most feared party of \"outlaws\" in the capital region, meaning the guards weren't bothered about the thief anymore, they had bigger problems.\n\nAnd it had two beautiful side effects. One, they were personally invested in the campaigns big bad. They weren't told by a guard \"go find this thief,\" they stumbled upon her themselves and were immediately made to look like fools; she stole their prize item, stabbed the paladin in the face, and caused them to be exiled from the capital. The second effect was that none of them ever flirted with npcs again. The party became totally professional, stopped acting like frat boys, and the campaign was considerably better for it.\n\nAnd the paladin gained the best motivation a player can get - take out his arch nemesis and retrieve the incredible shield.\n\nThere's three morals to this story.\n\nThe first is don't trust your DM - when you play the game of dice you win or you die.\n\nThe second is don't take a powerful item for granted - the DM giveth and the DM taketh away.\n\nThe third is don't immediately kill innocent NPCs - any smart DM will come up with some way to make their murder integral to the plot, and it will come back to bite you in the ass.",

        "text": "A week ago today, my wife made the decision to have her 15 year old dog put to sleep.  Spike was a cool little guy; at easter we would always put those bunny ear headbands on his back, and he'd prance around like a little fairy dog.  My wife would colour his hair and he was an excellent pet to my children.  When he died, I decided that I would immortalise him in my family's Dungeons and Dragons setting.  I wrote this for my wife a couple of days ago, and I hope you like it:\n\n\nAlistra (a 20th level half celestial drow cleric of Eilistree) was exhausted but content as she alighted on the balcony of her room.  She folded the great wings that took her aloft so easily and shrugged off the diaphanous robe that she wore while dancing the dance of her goddess under the moonlight.  Her children and grandchildren would be here in the morning, and all was well with the world.   Then she was hit by sadness; all was not well with the world.  Her goddess was still gone, and even though she fought against evil as hard as ever she had, she still felt like something was missing.  She climbed into the large bed with her husband.  He was fast asleep, and didn't awaken.  He worked hard during the day, training the paladins of the temple and working the small farms that kept them all fed.  She closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep.\n\nShe woke to the sound of laughing and whispers and sat upright in bed.  She was no longer in her room, but in the middle of a great forest.  Beyond the foot of her bed, a trio of drow women looked at her and talked.  One, taller and more beautiful than the rest, looked at Alistra and smiled.  \n\n“Be well, my daughter, for I have returned.”  Alistra knew in her heart that this was Eilistraee, the Dark Maiden herself and not a dream.  “I have returned to this world, and I bring a…strange message and a task to you, from another goddess of another world.  Listen close, so that you may know the wishes of Beatrix, the hearth mother (A goddess in a homebrew world I based on my wife)”.  Alistra listened, and all the while her heart was filled again with joy. \n\nThe sun broke through the windows of the room, and Alistra’s husband stirred.  She smiled and stretched, remembering last night’s dreams, and feeling of fullness in her soul.  She sat up, and the small, strange creature that Eilistraee has tasked her with looking after sat up, and snuffled over to her.  Butterfly wings shimmering, long white fur glistening.  He pawed at the bed as she ruffled his hair.\n\n“Good morning, little friend!  The dawn is at hand and the children will be here soon!  Let’s go and get ready to meet them!”  With a yawn and a yap, Spike the fairy-dog took to the air and followed his new mistress out of the room and into his new brand new life. \n\n\nSpike meant a lot to my wife, and now he lives on as a companion and guardian of my wife's fictional family, forever.  Plus he gets to be a pretty fairy-dog.  The stats for Spike can be found here: http://imgur.com/XUV9d4E\n\nThanks.\n\n\n",

        "text": "Our Vampire game, for those who haven't heard of it before, is a little complicated. \n\nGoing on two years now, with the same group of people meeting every week, our story has ballooned into a tangled mess of intersecting plotlines that I cannot summarize here, but with these plot threads come loads of NPCs. [And I do mean loads](https://sfvampires.wordpress.com/known-npcs/). Sometimes in this mess, NPCs that originate in relation to one plot thread get dragged along to complete new ones, which is a hell of a lot of fun, so long as no one gets killed and/or eaten. And sometimes even if they do.\n\nThis clip occurs after two *very* long in-game nights wherein my character blew up a bridge, recovered an ancient statue from UC Berkeley with the help of the school's absent-minded Toreador dean, fought a bunch of goons sent by our Big Bad, argued with some neutral-aligned werewolves, fought a bunch of Settites sent by who-the-fuck-knows, argued with one of the other PC's over information on my long-lost sister, and now is meeting with a fucking mokole *dragon* about aforementioned ancient statue. I just want to get my shit done and go home for the day, but the dragon has other plans, dragging in another NPC ally of ours and making eyes at my magical shape-changing sword.\n\nThe other NPC, a British historian Toreador, helps me take stock of the whole situation and, thankfully, [find some humor amidst the madness](http://raptor.zombox.org/vampire_recordings/2015_04_07_npc_forget.mp3).\n\nFull writeups of our campaign [can be found on our blog](https://sfvampires.wordpress.com).\n\n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/379cq2/dd_5e_how_the_chucklefucks_handle_a_covert/",
        "text": "At the outset of our latest session, [The Glorious Chucklefucks](https://i.imgur.com/rOaUt25.jpg) are in the city of Induta, a lawless shit hole inhabited by all manner of criminals, cultists, and other unsavory fuckers. The PCs are seeking information about a group whose members recently attacked a party hosted in the PCs' honor by the region's king. Upon arriving in Induta, the first order of business is to decide who will go into the city proper and who will remain with the ship; Friedrich Eisenberg, at six foot nine and with one of the most well-known faces in the world, is deemed somewhat inconspicuous and elects to stay on the ship with the six men of the king's guard and Noel, who is resting after taking a severe wound from a mutant hound. Thus Patrick, the \"warforged druid\", and Nathaniel head into the city seeking information, the lattermost being under the effects of Alter Self to disguise his appearance despite having been assured that a heavy cloak would work just as well.\n\nI'm not going to describe everything that happened in the city chronologically, but there was no one event from the session which stood out enough to justify its own tale. As such, I'll present this Game Tale in the form of a sort of highlight reel. Among the absurd bullshit in which the Glorious Chucklefucks engaged while attempting to carry out a covert investigation, there is:\n\nNathaniel notices a mugger trying to take his shit and proceeds to...I don't know what he was going for, but the \"warforged druid\" steps in and helpfully disarms the mugger. Patrick manages to steal the thief's wallet as he's running away, turning a profit on the attempted mugging.\n\n\"Warforged druid\" tries to haggle with a bartender and nearly gets shot in the face.\n\nThanks to outrageous rolls, skinny little fucking Nathaniel manages to intimidate a big burly asshole and prevent a barfight, only to start another one later; when he notices a man poison another man's drink, his response is to tell the guy that his drink was poisoned. This leads to, \"You trying to fucking poison me?\" and a brawl ensues. Nathaniel takes a punch to the face...and turns around to try and follow the poisoner. He takes another punch to the back of the head, at which point we all expect him to turn around and deal with the thug. Instead, he keeps walking toward the door. I am baffled at this point, motherfucking agape. Can't believe the dumbassery on display. Motherfucker gets punched in the back of the head again, and I tell him that next time he'll have to make a Constitution save or pass the fuck out. Finally Nathaniel uses Blink and nopes the fuck out of there, shaking his pursuers and meeting the lads back at the boat, having learned nothing.\n\nPatrick, wandering through a bad neighborhood, gets attacked by a gang and responds not by attacking, but by grappling one guy's balls. Shit you not, he has the Grappler feat and uses it to grab the fuck on to that dude's balls. Once the nut-grappled goon passes out, Patrick uses monk bullshit to run up the wall of a nearby building and escape. He is followed, however, to the group's boat.\n\nFriedrich and the king's men turn out to be terrible at keeping watch, with Friedrich critically failing to notice the molotov cocktail careening toward the boat, and the lads are forced to flee to the pier, where they are surrounded by goons. Friedrich uses Compel Duel to force their leader into single combat and blows his fucking head off with one shot from his rifle. The remaining thugs run in fear, and the party spends the rest of the night in Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion.\n\nFinally, the height of bullshit shenanigans that session came when the party visited a sketchy store the next day, and I made a very grave error: forgetting that my players are fucking five years old, I used the word \"dank\" (adjective: unpleasantly moist or humid; damp and, often, chilly) to describe the interior of a dark, damp building. We were derailed for at least ten minutes. Assholes.\n\nBizarre? Yes. But it's just business as usual for these chucklefucks.",

        "text": "As previously stated, this was a homebrew setting where the living was easy, absurdity was high and rules took a backseat to fun. \n\nLast time on my rambling tales, the party consisting of the antisocial rogue, Super Sneaks as I will now call him, the surprisingly suave archer, now known as Archer Bro, and the mage/swordsman played by myself had entered the super spooks Bleak Woods. I got impaled by a zombie the size of a crane and miraculously came back to life. We killed baddies, saved a lady and narrowly avoided getting mugged by her assassin buddies when Archer Bro unleashed his crouching tiger hidden charisma technique. We were now on our way to a castle to find a necromancer and plant his face firmly into the dirt.\n\nProblem was, we had a few obstacles in our way before we could kick down his door and piss in his potted plants. The first one was a skeletal knight sporting golden armor and riding a phantom steed. We encountered this prick three separate times on our hike. The first time he destroyed us and nearly killed me before we were able to drop a metric ton of smoke bombs Super Sneaks was hiding in his handy haversack and we made our tactical retreat. The second time we were able to surprise him and kill his horse before he summoned a bunch of zombies to distract us and walked off, laughing at us as best he could for being a skeleton and therefore not having vocal chords to laugh with. The third time was when we finally got him dead to rights. Me and Archer Bro peppered him with arrows and magic missiles to keep him distracted while Super Sneaks crawled up behind him and embedded my soul sword into the back of his head. I then used my extremely rare and valuable soul destroying sword as a lightning rod to call down three bolts of lightning directly onto his face. He went down and all three of us curb stomped the skeleton until it was nothing but dust. We then took the dust, burned it even more to be sure, and scattered it to the four winds to make sure he would never come back. We really hated this guy.\n\nThe second ordeal wasn't even a combat situation, but it was more terrifying than the golden skull knight. To get to the castle, we had to get through an underground tunnel system. At the entrance, there was a warning that something was down there and would attack us if we had any light. Lacking any way of getting darkvision, we tied ourselves together with rope and descended down into the completely dark tunnel. As we slowly shimmied along the wall, knee deep in sludge, we could hear ragged breathing that we couldn't find what direction it was coming from. Then Super Sneaks fell down. As he fell, his dagger hit something hard and caused a spark. The time the spark was alive was enough for the thing to take Super Sneaks down to 10 health, completely cut his armor to ribbons and sever the rope connecting him to us. We tried to lead him back to us with our voices but the echo of the tunnel made it impossible. We eventually felt our way to him and continued along the wall until we finally found the exit. As we left, Archer Bro gave a quick yelp, saying that he caught a glimpse of something moving as we closed the door. We blocked that stupid tunnel up with boulders and never looked back.\n\nFinally we made it to the necromancer's castle. Plenty upset from the stuff we had to go through to get there, we charged the front door, killing everything in sight. Several charred zombie corpses and a puzzle room that somehow made us dislike the necromancer even more, we made it to the throne room that was hidden in a pocket dimension. Necromancer tells us his evil scheme, we tell him to eat a bag of soggy dicks and he calls in his last line of defense. Patches, the 300 foot tall zombie wielding a hook chain, ports in and roars his zombie roar. This normally would have a fear effect but I was getting pretty tired of this crap and popped the cork on a potion of stupid heroism that I had been given when we first accepted the job to go into the creepy forest and had been holding onto for some time now. To this day, I am certain that the ingredients were just water and a whole lot of cocaine.\n\nLetting out my own roar, I side-stepped his first attack, jumped on his weapon and ran up his arm, dragging my soul sword through his chain and flesh as I did so. I got up to Patches' head and started repeatedly stabbing him as he tried to swat me off. It was kind of like Shadow of the Colossus if Wander was a caffeine junky and the colossi were zombies. After a good number of stabs, I surfed down the bridge of his nose and chucked a bomb made of alchemist's fire and holy water that I tied together with string into his eye as I jumped off. I used a feather fall at the last second to stick the landing as the huge zombie's right eye exploded into meaty chunks and holy fire. Patches didn't seem to mind the missing eye too much and continued swinging at us. The necromancer laughed at me while teleporting out of the way of the attacks of the other two.\n\n\"You dolt, you can't kill my minion like that! He is powered by hundreds of souls inside him and will keep fighting as long as they are still working. lololololol.\"\n\nOkay, cool. Thanks for the tip dumbass.\n\nRe-coating my soul sword with holy energy, I use a maximum power wind blast to rocket myself all the way back up to Patches' face then dive into his mouth. Through the black energy inside that's trying to tear me apart, I see the ball of souls powering Patches. My sword was made for the sole purpose of destroying souls, but with this quantity I would be torn apart by the black energy before I could get them all. Then I powered up my sword's special ability. Once I had destroyed a certain number of souls, my sword would get the ability to use the residual energy collected from the shattered souls to release a wave of energy from the sword Zangetsu style. The more souls I destroyed between each time I used this power, the larger and more powerful the wave would be. I had killed a lot of zombies on the way to this fight, probably in the hundreds, destroying their souls and building up energy. I poured it all out on this big ball of souls.\n\nTo the others, I had jumped into Patches' mouth and hadn't come out for some time. Then, a giant wave of energy coated in holy magic erupted from Patches, cutting him in half and causing him to dissolve away. In the bubbling  corpse of the massive zombie, they saw me, throwing out the horns and screaming a victory shout to the heavens before falling to my knees and gasping for breath. It was metal as fuck dude.\n\nThe necromancer sighed, realizing that he couldn't play around with us anymore as our undivided attention was now on him.\n\n\"Whenever you're ready\" he said to us, channeling dark energy into preparing an attack.\n\n\"In that case, we're gonna take a five minute lunch break\" I replied.\n\nEveryone be like, \"Wut\" :V\n\nI sit down and unpack the lunch I had brought with me, chugging a health potion as well. The other two are kinda confused but decide to go along with it and sit beside me. The necromancer, and consequently the GM, is really surprised by this but decides that he did say whenever we were ready and just sort of stands there waiting.\n\n\"Hey, can you hand me a health potion?\" the necromancer asks, \"the archer pegged my shoulder and I kinda want to heal that\". The other two object but I say \"Sure thing\" and toss him one of our extra potions.\n\nMe- \"As the potion leaves my hand, I teleport behind him and break his neck.\"\n\nGM- Double Wut?\n\nMe- \"Can't say no, natural 20.\"\n\nThe necromancer was dead in my arms and I stabbed him a few times with my soul sword to be safe. Everyone was absolutely stunned that I just unceremoniously snapped the big bad's neck and tossed him aside. After a minute the GM just started laughing, he couldn't even be mad at this turn of events, we had already done a lot of hard fights anyway. We looted the place, told the village of our victory and marched out of the Bleak Woods back the the hub city.\n\nSo that's the anticlimactic end to our tromp through the Bleak Woods, by far one of the best parts of the campaign. But there are still more stories to come about Super Sneaks, Archer Bro and yours truly.\n\nNext Time: Hyper-nova Hot Potato \"We know you're evil, can we just kill you already?\"",

        "text": "So, I'm stress testing [The Underground](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/673212907/the-underground-a-sam-and-fuzzy-rpg) and it's a freaking weird experience, in just about every sense. [Last time](http://redd.it/36vu28), there was a big to-do with Ninjas and Biker Hampsters (or gerbils, whatever) getting all up in the party's grill, and then the party did some wackiness and pretty much trashed a fast food joint. The players, for the purposes of today's session, are:\n\n* [Bullmime, avant garde artist extraordinare. \"Normal\" human, built like a bulldog bred with a deranged mime. Surprisingly likeable.](http://i.imgur.com/GPR6sZx.png)\n* [Lupusexpress, wolfwoman delivery person devoted to her job. Occasionaly chases red rubber balls.](http://i.imgur.com/uTafvow.png)\n* [Denial, perfectly normal delivery guy who is furiously trying to stay afloat in world getting weirder day by day.](http://i.imgur.com/1aw8O5g.jpg)\n* [Medstudent, a \"normal\" human clinic worker and also the most deranged of the party. Tried to drain Denial's blood once.](http://i.imgur.com/3kTnmpb.png)\n\nAnd introducing...\n\n* [Squidalibre, half-human half-squid, luchadore wrestler. A bit of a LEEROY.](http://i.imgur.com/EKy6nOn.jpg)\n* [Landlady, prefectly normal lady whose sanity is starting to crack under the pressure of putting up with her weird-ass tennents (Squidalibre, Denial and Medstudent).](http://i.imgur.com/4Pax9qT.jpg)\n\nSquidalibre, Denial and Medstudent had a problem. That of RENT. Landlady was a *kind old-ish woman* who was *nice to them* and *starting to come unhinged*, so the three joined forces to go scrounge up some cash. Which meant Medstudent driving over to a fast food joint and trying to beg cash off of Bullmime. This did not work. Things got even worse when Medstudent recieved a call from his sketchy-as-shit boss, who offered 100$ in exchange for some fresh blood. Medstudent then proceeded to assault his landlady with a hypodermic needle.\n\nThat particular event ended with Medstudent rocking a neat concussion and dumped in an alleyway, Squidalibre battling a bunch of ninjas with a table, Landlady running out of the joint screaming, and Denial dreamily trying to eat his fries as though they had not just been weaponized by Squidalibre as emergency shurikens. Medstudent made the best of things by siphoning a large amount of blood from a passed-out hobo and rounding up his \"friends\" for a visit to [Herr Doktor Sketchbag](http://i.imgur.com/tTpnTbF.jpg). Perhaps inevitably, they made a mess of this as well. See, the hobo blood was laced with... something, and Sketchbag proceeded to trip balls shortly after drinking it... right in front of everyone. The entire party glared at Medstudent, as if he was a complete goddamn psychopath. Medstudent proceeded to reinforce this idea by asking the high-as-a-kite Sketchbag if he had any weapons lying around, because now priority one on Medstudent's mind was gunning down a bunch of gerbil gangsters in broad daylight.\n\nThis led to a wacky chain of events where the party got dragged into a back-alley deal with an addlebrained \"lost body part collector\", who claimed that his dog had stolen his shotgun. Said dog proceeded to walk into the scene, just in time to fire the shotgun directly at Medstudent's back. Squidalibre leapt to the rescue, smacking the canine assasin with a wet pool noodle and then punting it over the rooftops. But now there were two new problems- one, there were sirens approaching, and two, Squidalibre was now holding the gun that had been used to shoot Medstudent. Oh, and three, Medstudent had been shot. Oh \"no\". What a \"shame\". Squidalibre lunged to the rescue once more, carrying the arms dealer under one arm, the bleeding Medstudent on the other, and trying his level best to avoid the police pursuit (Denial and Landlord, meanwhile, had nope'd the hell out of there and were determinedly heading home to erase the night's events from their memories). Medstudent was delivered to a vet, who perscribed bandages and a ringworm pill.\n\nSome time later, Medstudent recieved a knock on his door from someone who looked like the bastard child of [Count Nosferatu and a Jehova's witness](http://i.imgur.com/dxr4Njg.jpg). He was given a brief pitch of the wonders of \"tempering the bloodlust\" and \"the marvels of fitting in with human society\", before Medstudent cut in saying that A) he wasn't a vampire and B) he just sometimes killed homeless people by draining their blood. The good Count Jehova proceeded to drop the act and fire a pistol at Medstudent's face. He dodged, which was unfortunate, because the shot ended up destroying the living room TV. Squidalibre, Medstudent and Count Jehova proceeded to get into a heated argument about interrupting the WWE marathon, vampire ethics, and how gallingly stupid it was for Medstudent to tell a random stranger that he was a serial killer. Count Jehova proceeded to blame the group for the enabling of a rogue vampire (Sketchbag), and that if Medstudent was going to live to see tomorrow, Sketchbag had to be brought to justice. To prove his point, Count Jehova demonstrated that he had a sniper aiming at Medstudent's face. Squidalibre's hero instincts kicked in once more, and he bashed Medstudent over the head with a vase to make him duck. Medstudent was rendered unconscious. Count Jehova facepalmed.\n\nThus, the party (consisting this time of everyone but Lupusexpress) crammed into Medstudent's slightly creepy van and left for Doktor Sketchbag's shady back-alley clinic to hunt for clues. Apparently, the tripping-balls-Sketchbag had done a bit of redecorating, because the entire place was covered with ruptured bloodbags. Goody. Denial managed to do some searching and find the Hilariously Cliche Secret Lair Entrance^^TM complete with creepy stalker pictures and body pillows with blood bags affixed to the neck. Yeah, so Sketchbag had to die, and somebody had to calm down Landlady, who did not want to be here and was gibbering in the corner. So they slapped a bottle of Jack Daniels into her hand and told her it was all a dream, and then set to work reading through the creepy stalker diaries. They found the apparent target of Sketchbag, some unsuspecting normal girl, and set off to stop the NEFARIOUS BUSINESS.\n\nHalfway there, they realized that they didn't actually have a plan. Thankfully, the still-tipsy Landlady stepped up to bat, as she had been in the neighborhood before, and knocked on NormalGirl's door and promptly asked her out to dinner and a movie. NormalGirl accepted, and the two went off for a lovely night on the town.\n\n\"Guys, I think our Landlady is actually our best infiltrator.\"\n\nWith that, the party broke into her house and started rummaging through her things (finding numerous shitty vampire novels, but otherwise nothing out of the ordinary), and settled in to wait for Sketchbag. They spotted him trying to hide behind a lawn flamingo, and Squidalibre took off in pursuit. When this didn't quite work, Bullmime hijacked Medstudent's shitty van and aimed it in the general direction of Sketchbag, and then proceeded to crash said van into a regiment of lawn gnomes (performance art, ho!). However, this distracted Sketchbag enough that Squidalibre caught up and started smacking him with a wet steak (having misheard the vampire rumors). Sketchbag retaliated by biting the shit out of Squidalibre. Now, the interesting thing about vampires in this system is that their bite does not turn people into a vampire... it turns them into a Wolfman.\n\nSQUIDALIBRE evolved into WOLFSQUID!\n\nDespite his new fuzzy outlook, Squidalibre kept up the chase, though now both participants were heavily wounded. The spontaneous interference of Medstudent was of no use whatsoever, as he was still reeling from near-fatal gunshot wounds and a concussion. This all came to an abrupt conclusion when Squidalibre and Sketchbag were both struck by the delivery van of Lupusexpress, who hadn't been paying attention to the road. Medstudent arrived on scene just in time to attempt medical attention, only to Turbo Fail the roll and jab himself with his own sedatives, turning it into a three-man dogpile of unconscious bodies. Lupusexpress exited his delivery van to take stock of the situation, seeing:\n\n* An unconscious vampire that looked like Nicolas Cage\n* An exceedingly furry man-squid in a lucha mask, also unconscious\n* That creepy-as-shit \"Clinic Worker\" that she had learned to avoid\n\nWith that, Lupusexpress made the morally correct decision- she got back in her van and completed the freakin' delivery. It turned out to be in the very house that NormalGirl lived in. Thus, Lupusexpress ran straight into Denial, who had been confused as to why the house was suddenly empty. One quick explanation of \"I'm housesitting\" later, Lupusexpress and Denial left the premesis (after conscientiously putting everything away and locking the doors) and drove off to get some chinese food. Bullmime flagged them down, having survived the crash with no injuries whatsoever, and then everyone begrudgingly agreed to pick up Squidalibre and Medstudent on the way [(after taking selfies, obviously)](http://i.imgur.com/vVk05OG.jpg). As for Sketchbag, Denial may have \"accidentally\" nudged Lupusexpress onto a collision course with the unconscious vampire. Three times. \n\nWith that, the entire gang crashed Landlady's date, Medstudent was strapped into a high-chair, and the gang informed Count Jehova of their success. Fade to black as Squidalibre slowly regains consciousness while facedown in a plate of delicious calamari.\n\nDid I mention this game is freaking weird?",

        "text": "According to reddit it's been about 4 months, so it's time I kept my word and we return to the saga of Kingmaker, where plenty has happened since Chapter [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/2sk6si/confessions_of_a_serial_party_killer_ch_1/)(New readers can also check out Ch [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/2solbs/confessions_of_a_serial_party_killer_ch_2_suicide/) and [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/314pec/confessions_of_a_serial_party_killer_ch_3_the/) but they center around a different campaign).  I'd originally intended to tell a different story today, but so much happened in-between the death of the druid and the story I wanted to tell that I ran out of characters. \n\n&gt;Druid is dead and it's my character's fault.  It's not something he's happy about, but he can live with it, he's done worse and he will do worse again on his way to the throne.\n\n&gt;Druid's player, as I've mentioned in comments, is an interesting guy and didn't take the kill personally OOC, he comes back at us with what appears to be a ranger of some kind, or, at least, a guy with a bow who can make survival checks.\n\n&gt;Make initial reports and do some more scouting out in the forbidden zone, but basically my character and Saul convince their government that the undead threat in the forbidden zone has been vastly overstated by Shieldmaidens and it's ready to be opened up.\n\n&gt;Goodnewseveryone.jpg, it turns out there's actually a conclave of all the nations who signed the agreement to forbid the zone in the first place coming up in a month or so.\n\n&gt;My character and Saul(Both of us are absolutely devastating diplomancers and at this point our interests are completely aligned) persuade the guy they were working for to let them meet the head diplomat, then persuade the head diplomat he should bring us along to the conclave as eyeball witnesses if needed.\n\n&gt;Interestingly, along with the diplomatic group comes a very rich merchant from the only country in the region that A) Isn't a signatory to the forbidden zone treaty and B) Allows government overseen necromancy instead of treating it as a capital crime.\n\n&gt;As we're travelling Saul and I take turns probing the diplomat and the necromancy guy we find out he's the representative of a powerful merchant's consortium that basically owns his country's government, and the debts of our country's government, and does **not** want the forbidden zone open because they have a monopoly on all the water-based shipping that has to go around it.\n\n&gt;While we're gathering information the ninja sneaks into his tent and starts reading his papers, and, in the process, manages to blindly activate(He rolled a 1 on linguistics) a scroll of color spray.\n\n&gt;Hilarity ensues, but thankfully even though the ninja has piss-poor luck on 80% of his rolls his player is good at thinking quick and he often gets the clutch 20'.  He immediately activates racial disguise self and uses sleeves of many garments to turn himself into one of the merchant's guards, then runs off in a random direction.\n\n&gt;Saul and my character are on the case, I immediately guard the merchant, Saul investigates, ninja(now out of disguise) whispers what happened to him, and we conclude that the guard was trying to rob his employer.  Bluff somewhere in excess of 30.  \n\n&gt;The next day the guard is now one of the loinclothed and chained slaves pulling the barge up the river.  \n\n&gt;We arrive at the city where the conclave is being held, and as soon as we've spent a day there with Saul and my character gathering information we conclude that shit is fucked.\n\n&gt;Practically every country is going to vote against opening up the forbidden zone for different reasons.  If we don't open the zone up, we don't have anywhere to Kingmake (Okay we do, there was a conversation about our own illegal bandit kingdom but that was Plan R at best)\n\n&gt;bettercallsaul\n\n&gt;In the two sessions that follow comes a magnificent flow of bullshit between Saul and my character.\n\n&gt;Saul works the back rooms, lobbying, politicking and blackmailing where he can.\n\n&gt;Meanwhile my character, a mysterious young nobleman with an exotic and beautiful lady on his arm/bodyguard(The Fey) circulates through society, getting the pulse, swaying nobles and circulating half a dozen different rumors.\n\n&gt;Ninja ninjas around among the servants gathering us information on a different level.\n\n&gt;Even the ranger(?) gets into it, going out among the common folk and having parties at inns and, in the process, making perform checks with his lute that would make a bard jealous to sing songs about all the opportunity out there in the forbidden zone.\n\n&gt;We start getting a few votes our way, and then Saul and I really go to work, as I appeal to the diplomat's inherent patriotism about the fact that our country's being pimped out by these necromantic merchant motherfuckers who've spent centuries buying out all our debts and crushing our possibility of profiting by charging huge percentages on all our trade.\n\n&gt;He gives what I ask for, \"unofficial authorization,\" we're not government functionaries and anything we say or do can be denied by him, but we *can* get meetings with other diplomats or the people who serve the same roles for them as we serve for our diplomat.\n\n&gt;My character has his first taste of real power, and it is sweet.\n\n&gt;Two of the countries still voting against opening the forbidden zone are doing it because they're ancient enemies on opposite sides of this neutral buffer, and they both know that as soon as the zone is open it's only a matter of time before they're going to war over it.\n\n&gt;Saul and I not only convince these countries that they should open the zone and our country will support their territorial claims(very carefully double-speaking it so that we're only supporting each side up to a boundary *we've* drawn) but that they should loan our government money to buy out necromancy debt so we can vote for it, too.\n\n&gt;Convince orc empire(think persians with green skin) that it's totally in their interests even though they don't have a border with the forbidden zone, because the incipient war it's going to cause will allow them to eat up the two countries we just persuaded to buy out our debt.\n\n&gt;Convince the elf empire(Think latter day romans, a decadent civilization that knows it's in its twilight) who also has no border on the zone to vote for opening it, because the loss in profits will weaken the necromantic merchants' profitable hold on the oceans and the elves already have the second best navy in the region, they could easily own the sea again.\n\n&gt;What went from a sure \"no\" vote is now very nearly tied.\n\n&gt;While resting in his quarters my character hears a knock at his door.\n\n&gt;It's a heavily cloaked woman with the speech and bearing of nobility, expensive but tasteful accents, obviously the real deal, saying she needs my help and asking if she can please come in and speak to me.\n\n&gt;Character assumes she's coming to him because he's been making a name for himself as a gentleman of means and power, so he lets her in, asks how he can help her.\n\n&gt;\"I'm sorry, but this is how.\"  Noblewoman pulls off her cloak to reveal she's all bruised up and her clothes are pre-torn, starts shrieking her head off.\n\n&gt;Oh fuck no.  Character runs right by her, throws his door open, goes out in the hall and raises his hands because he knows that in a setup like this guards will be right around the cor-\n\n&gt;\"Stop right there, criminal scum!\"\n\n&gt;The actual captain of the fucking guard was apparently 50' from my door, what a coincidence.  Oh, and apparently he and the young noblewoman are already well acquainted by how she's sobbing against his chest.\n\n&gt;bettercallsaul\n\n&gt;Guard captain gets up in character's face, starts questioning him, guards are shoving him around.  Captain is not just obviously a part of the framejob that's happening, but he's also being rude as fuck to my character.  The latter is really worse, in a way, the first was just business, and could have been excused.\n\n&gt;\"My character is physically cooperating with whatever they're doing, but he's not saying **anything**\n\n&gt;Saul's player: \"Good boy.\"\n\n&gt;Guards drag me down hallway, right by Saul's door.\n\n&gt;\"SAAAAAUUUUUL!  I'M BEING ARRESTED!\"\n\n&gt;Saul comes out, was obviously asleep again, pissed as hell, and follows us all the way to the guardhouse to make sure I don't get injured \"resisting arrest.\"\n\n&gt;Saul is already questioning them about charges, about her word vs mine, about why they were so close.\n\n&gt;\"My character is sitting quietly in his cell, he's not complaining, he's not talking to guards or other prisoners, he knows he's not going to be here long.\"\n\n&gt;Saul's player: \"Good boy.\"\n\n&gt;Saul gets a judge there in the middle of the night to try to get me loose on the lack of hard evidence.\n\n&gt;Unfortunately my character starts running his mouth trying to press the judge with his apparent authority.\n\n&gt;Pushes judge too far, back to jail.\n\n&gt;Saul's Player: \"What did we learn?\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"Shut up and let the lawyer talk?\"\n\n&gt;Saul's Player: \"Good boy.\"\n\n&gt;While I sit in jail the rest of the party figures out what's going on.  The merchant who came with us had been trying to just bribe everybody to vote no, but now that that's not working anymore he's identified me as his major problem and this was his solution, they even find out the noble lady(she's actually a bard/courtesan but she's one of the most popular and respected/loved people in the city)'s brother has a bad gambling problem and apparently somebody bought up all his debts.  Familiar pattern.\n\n&gt;The Fey, the ninja and the lawyer lean on the Lady until she recants her accusation against my character, and by now have identified where he's holding the brother.  No sooner am I out of jail than we go on a raid to recover Lady's brother.\n\n&gt;Hyjinks ensue, the Fey wrecks shit, the ninja ninjas, the ranger(?) goes straight downstairs and finds a guard slitting some young guy's throat, kills him, and starts trying to keep the kid from bleeding out.\n\n&gt;The head guard is some kind of goddamn monk/rogue/I'm not even sure but he's obviously a few levels above us.  Goes invis, obviously intends to end our shit.  The Fey's having none of it.  Fucking blind she still manages to hit this guy twice for around 40 damage total.  The others are fighting in the hall, I suddenly get a bad feeling and run back to the Lady and, sure enough, I hear somebody coming from a different direction, somebody invisible.\n\n&gt;With nothing but a knife(I'd been disarmed of my halberd) I scream \"I am &lt;long pretentious noble name&gt; and this woman is under my protection, if any man lays hand on her I swear I will fucking gut you.\"  \n\n&gt;DM: Roll intimidate.\n\n&gt; Nat-20 and like I said, diplomancer.\n\n&gt;DM: You smell urine and hear the sound of retreating footsteps.\n\n&gt;Ranger(?) brings bleeding guy upstairs, and since I've got levels of wizard now, I slap an Infernal Healing on him.  Yep, it's Lady's brother.  We put them into protective custody and Saul has her write an affadavit that she was threatened on the life of her brother by the necromantic merchant to frame me.\n\n&gt;While all this has been going on the ranger(?), since he's not real big on the politicking has been running around town at night, and found out that normally the street is deserted at sunset because this town has a Spring-Heeled Jack, an evil murderous terror fey.  He meets the Jack and they have some weird times because the Jack is missing his knife and so the Ranger(?) is teaching him other, interesting ways to scare people.\n\n&gt;Unfortunately the Ranger(?) doesn't tell the rest of the party about any of this.  The reason this is unfortunate is that the Fey is, you know, a Fey, and the Ninja actually **found** Jack's knife weeks previously, and wound up showing it to the Fey since he couldn't read the sylvan inscription, so she is carrying it right now.\n\n&gt;However, the night after we finish getting me unframed the Fey finally meets Jack and makes friends with him.  Makes him promise not to hurt her or her friends, and then gives him his knife back.  He's eager for a new victim to try it out on, and she suggests Necromantic Merchant.\n\n&gt;The next morning he's found totally butchered, but we were all in an inn celebrating my release at the time.  Well, other than the ninja who was planting evidence that the Necromantic Merchant was trying to sway the vote to keep the Forbidden Zone closed because the Necromantic Country is building up a Necromantic Army to try to start the Third Simulacrum War and they want the Shieldmaidens nice and occupied in the Forbidden Zone chasing the occasional zombie.\n\n&gt;This sways the last country we need, and the vote comes through.  The Forbidden Zone will officially be opened in a year's time, but we already know our country's major enemy has farms there that we'd seen while scouting, so we get a post-dated royal decree that our party(along with an NPC who's more or less going to be the expedition's figurehead) will be given the authority and responsibility for setting up a new colony.\n\n&gt;We head back down the river from the town and split off from the diplomatic group.  Inbetween towns so nobody will remark his leaving, my character has a talk with the ninja and sends him on a mission.\n\n&gt;Saul is sent to get the money/supplies/peons for setting up our colony.\n\n&gt;Ranger(?) has now started studying with an inter-country college of sages so that's keeping him busy.\n\n&gt;The Fey takes my character along on her own personal quest and we learn she's being tasked by The Winter Queen herself with opening up portals.  In the process of learning this/proving worthy, my character spends a week cleaning Baba Yaga's outhouse.  I still have nightmares.\n\n&gt;Meanwhile the ninja returns to town, spends a few days following his target, establishes he always gets his lunch at the same sausage stand, and proceeds to poison all the sausages.\n\n&gt;The Guard Captain finds himself walking down an alley as he munches, and suddenly gets paralyzed, but, as the ninja had stipulated, still conscious.  The ninja appears out of the shadows, puts blade to his throat, looks deepin his eyes, and says \"My lord (my character) sends his regards.\"  \n\n&gt;Coup de grace.  \n\nComing soon - Chapter 5: Karma's a Bitch.",

        "text": "So, I recently came into possession of the rulebook of [The Underground](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/673212907/the-underground-a-sam-and-fuzzy-rpg), and called up four of my chucklefuck friends (most of whom have never played a tabletop RPG, ever) to playtest a simple couple of sessions with me. I had no goddamn clue what I was getting into.\n\nThe scene: A sidewalk. A down-on-her-luck artist, [built like a bulldog interbred with a deranged mime](http://puu.sh/hW1GH/1f9c086493.jpg) (so just a regular mime, I guess), crashes into an aspiring med student. Doing the only sane thing, Bullmime takes offense and headbutts Medstudent's face. We are two minutes into the game at this point.\n\nThe situation de-escalates somewhat when Bullmime takes Medstudent to a diner as an apology. Another customer, [Denial](http://sta.sh/01ljvp4fv80i), is calmly eating at another booth, and a delivery woman is just entering the door to drop off a package. Did I mention that she's a six-foot-tall humanoid wolf? Because she's a fucking six-foot-tall humanoid wolf. [Wearing a cheery delivery uniform](http://puu.sh/hVYBY/4b4f5d8282.png). Oh, and she was followed through the door by a gerbil biker gang. The gang demands Lupusexpress's package, while fanning out and demanding the wallets of the diners- including Denial, Medstudent and Bullmime.\n\nWhen Bullmime takes offense, she is knocked unconscious by a flying hamsterball and sprawls facefirst into her milkshake. Medstudent furiously tries to resist the hypnotic cuteness of the gerbil bikers, and Denial starts throwing her half-eaten meal at the muggers. Lupusexpress, naturally, starts clawing and biting at the fuzzy little mcnuggets.\n\nA brief battle later, Medstudent and Denial have punted the gerbil biker ringleader through a convenient window, and Lupusexpress was sprawled across a countertop, trying to nip at the little birdies dancing around her head (she'd taken a couple of hamsterballs to the face). Thankfully, though, Medstudent had rescued the package- and the store manager, a man dressed like a motherfucking ninja, thanked everyone for their dilligence and bravery in defending the property of the ninja mafia (with the exception of Bullmime, who was snoring huge bubbles into her milkshake).\n\nNinja-sensei humbly asked the party if they would mind doing another errand for the glory of ninjas everywhere. As it happened, this involved taking ANOTHER package from Point A to Point B. Upon hearing the amount of Ninja Moolah this would earn everyone, the party hastily agreed and set out to retrieve the package in Denial's handy secondhand van.\n\nBut first, Lupusexpress stopped by the local park, got out, and started chasing a hamsterball (with a biker gerbil inside) while furiously barking. Upon catching it, Medstudent proceeded to play fetch while Denial tried to convince himself that none of this was actually happening. Right up until Lupusexpress couldn't catch the ball, because it was rolling too fast, and the party shouted for Denial to run over the hamsterball.\n\nDenial, still feeling salty about the whole mugging thing, complied.\n\nThis sparked an unholy shitstorm. Medstudent, who was dumb enough to stand out in the open and try to fight a horde of gerbils with only his floppy, pitiful fists, was quickly incapacitated by a horde of screeching, bloodthirsty rodents. Thankfully, Lupusexpress and Denial swung by to grab him before the gerbils could beat him to death, and made a hasty escape in the pitiful secondhand van. They succeded, and arrived at the first stop on their journey- a Ninja Burger. Oh, and they decided to get something to eat before they started the mission.\n\nIt was a damn lucky thing that Medstudent spotted the approaching gerbil horde and dragged everyone into the bathroom. Denial and Lupusexpress proceeded to have a whispered argument about going back out to retrieve their food while what sounded like an extremely low-budget kung-fu movie happened outside. Medstudent, not having any of this, wormed his way through a crawl space in the ceiling, found the backroom, and retrieved the package, dragging Denial and Lupusexpress behind him. Now, it was Denial's time to shine- abusing his power of Agressive Blandness, he casually walked out front, got in the shitty van, swung around to pick up his \"comrades\", and proceeded to drive completely unconcerned to the package destination. The only hiccup was when he rolled up a window on Lupusexpress's nose.\n\nThe gang returned to the original diner (where Bullmime had been taking) and collected their payment, then sat down to relax. Bullmime, meanwhile, had somehow wound up in the middle of a strawberry patch soaked with blood, bery juice, and standing above a dead pony (HOW!?). She subsequently lurched back to the diner to bum five bucks off of Medstudent. The bartering turned to intimidation, and then everyone watched in mixed horror/fascination as Bullmime proceeded to hurl Medstudent out of the already-broken window. She was then accosted by the ninja security, who mobbed her, resulting in two ninjas thrown out the aforesaid window, followed by the rest beating Bullmime into a unconsciousness with their katanas (sporting their snazzy Hasbro labels) and threw her out the same goddamned window.\n\nShortly after, Bullmime was approached by an extremely drugged-up faux-french fop in a beret, who praised her talent for \"avant-garde performance art\" and offered 50$ for another performance. Bullmime proceeded to put Medstudent in a headlock, hurl him into yet another fucking window and then set the fop's beret on fire. He was ecstatic and paid up immediately.\n\nOh, and Medstudnet later broke into Denial's apartment, intent on siphoning off a liter of his blood.\n\nWhat.",

        "text": "The following story is from a homebrew setting played fast and easy. Whatever was plausible or entertaining was allowed to happen.\n\nThis tale takes place before that fiasco with the dark phoenix as I seem to be remembering these is reverse. The actors are once again the antisocial triple threat of rogue, archer, and mage/best sword-fighter in the group. Team murder hobo gets a job to investigate a town in a creepy forest known as the Bleak Woods. We set off for adventure, trying out some new equipment by murdering a wandering swordsman with my new soul destroying sword as the archer punched out a group of orcs in a bar fight  with the help of his new ring that granted him unending endurance, and arrived in the Bleak Woods a few days later.\n\nI've been informed that the entire area was ripped entirely from a spooky forest area from WOW, which I haven't played so it was all fresh to me. We walk down the road of misty terrain and mangled trees, the GM put on some atmospheric music to make it more spooks and he kept mentioning something moving just out of sight. I was bringing up the rear when my chest started itching. I soon found out that the itch was coming from a MASSIVE HOOK AND CHAIN THAT HAD JUST IMPALED ME THROUGH THE TORSO so at least that mystery was solved pretty quickly.\n\nThe chain tensed and I was pulled away from the others at high speed. Not one to give up from something as simple as being impaled and dragged to my doom, I chucked my signature spell at the time, a spinning wheel of fiery death, at the source of the attack. The flame wheel seemed to hit its mark and the chain stopped pulling me, leaving me to bleed out in the middle of the road, fun times. That is, until the magic amulet of +3 plot convenience that I had raided from the tomb of a dead god started glowing and I miraculously came back to life. We didn't question it, it was war time, no time for questions.\n\nWe soon found a town being attacked by zombies. We soon killed all the zombies. The local priest tells us of a super bad necromancer raising the dead and had one special zombie named Patches that was about 300 feet tall and was probably the one who impaled me earlier. We decided that the bad necromancer was a bad dude who did evil stuff (I didn't have any necromancy or that dark resurrection spell yet so I had moral superiority) and got some holy gear from the town to go kill him for great justice. Holy stuff included holy daggers, arrows, and a spell that would put a holy coating on my sword that was made to destroy freaking souls. I don't know if that makes all the sense or none at all.\n\nVarious encounters such as zombies, spooky scary skeletons and a massive clicking spider that spewed acid everywhere later, we arrived at a graveyard where a lady was being attacked by some hulking zombies built like rotting refrigerators that ate people. Being the kind, generous, sweet, murderous, caring individuals we were, we jumped in, teleported out with the girl and ran into a barn for cover. Turns out that the girl was part of a group of thieves/assassins that immediately jumped us and demanded my glowing amulet that I was pretty sure was keeping me alive. Not wanting any of that, I cranked my light spell up to maximum output to the point where I cast the equivalent of a flash-bang and grabbed the other two. Now we were simply outnumbered instead of outnumbered and pressed against the ground, so that's good. Then the archer, this glorious, magnificent, psychopathic bastard, kicked his antisocial nature for just a minute and became an ace diplomat. He convinced those damn thieves to not only let us go without taking anything, but got them to show us on a map where the necromancer was holed up. We bid our new murder friends farewell and cut a bloody swath through the horde of zombies that were banging on the barn walls. This was the very best diplomacy roll and role playing I have experienced to this day, good job Mr. antisocial archer.\n\nNext Time: Patchwork Showdown \"I'll show you true courage!\"",

        "text": "Note this has been heavily edited from the actual session, the basic plot however is the same.\n\nA vassal of Swadia, what a proud title to bare. I look at that title and laugh sometimes, for it has given me nothing but pain in the end. I am Fredrik Wulfson, born a Nord. I came to Swadia to find my fortune, hearing on a merchants brother being captured I immediately rose to the challenge. I recruited five villagers, one of which who was with me to the end. Harald, I shall never forget his sacrifice. But back to the story, the merchants brother was rescued and I then began campaigning around Swadia. Recruiting a little war band of men. Who I taught how to ride, how to ride like the long gone winged hussars of the old Swadian empire. The Khergits themselves would one day question their spirituality in cavalry, but nonetheless I rode with my men. \n\nI freed villages, killed bandits, all whilst riding with my loyal war band. We then rose our own banner, that of my family a white and red flag with two swords crossed. We rode, gaining fame, we became legends. People flocked to join us, but I did not accept the rich who dared to think themselves above my men. For I to was a commoner, and my legendary cavalry rode, and I wished to server the empire of Swadia. The king accepted my wish and my war band became an army. Recruiting some Rhodok pike veterans to assist my foot soldiers. \n\nI was doing well now, my army flew the banner of Swadia. I was given a village, and that village would change so much. For that village was that of the Sarranids, and they hated me. So I fixed up the desolate village, I shall never forget the smile upon the children's faces at being able to meet my legendary cavalry. God those were beautiful times\n\nTimes that would be destroyed\n\nDestroyed by the corruption\n\nThe Aristocrats\n\nAnd Lord Despin, how I despise that name. \n\nI was ordered to fight the Sarranids, Despin promised the support of the Swadian army. When I arrived in the pass protected by the great fortress of Almerra, I found no other Swadian banners. So I did what any of Nord blood would do, attack... This great siege was victorious, quickly sending my cavalry to scout around the villages for any signs of unrest. They came, the armies of the Sarranids.\n\nThree times they attacked\n\nTwo times they lost\n\nOne time they nearly one, but thanks to Harald, who brought the cavalry back, right into the back of the charging Sarranids. I was victorious, I held a banquet in my victory. Inviting all, I requested that this castle be given to me. Since it was a grand victory of mine. But that snake Despin, he poisoned the kings mind. Made him think, that I would other throw him. That I was more loyal to my Nord brethren, his proof? Me letting free the great Nord general after his amazing last stand at the great battle of Jelbegi. He got the aristocrats, told them I threatened the rich. The king refused to accept that I owned teh castle, and Lord Despin and the Swadian army marched forth. I refused to acknowledge this and mad my own kingdom, the Kingdom of Frinksi. That lasted such a short time. My once Swadian brothers ran up on ladders to remove me from my stronghold. I saw Despin, and he saw me. He ran at me upon the walls, and with my huge body threw him off. Despin died that day, and it was a glorious day for me and my comrades. But then the king himself arrived, and the entire Swadian army came upon me, and I was defeated. No one survived, all were killed. Except for me and Harald, who was kept alive. \n\nI didn't know why, but he and I then escaped. With the help of an admiring guard we escaped, stole two horses and rode off as fast as I could to Shariz. The Sultan himself greeted me, and gave me a heroes welcome. With an army of Mamlukes and Swadian prisioners, I rode back to Almerra. I won that siege, I won the war.\n\n\n\nAs I marched victoriously through Praven, I saw a familiar face. A face which I had come to despise with so much pain and sorrow. It was the face of Despin, I took Harald aside and told him this. Harald laughed, \"Glory to Swadia.\" He said before stabbing me with his knife. I had been betrayed once more, lying in agony on the floor. Despin had not died that fateful day it seems, he only became lame, and dishonored. I stumbled all the way to the palace, where Harald was speaking to Despin. I drew my blade and then, and then I fell to the ground. Wheezing in pain, Harald laughed, \"You think that I would really let you destroy my homeland and give nothing in return?\" He kicked me, \"you are truly a greedy man, just like Despin said.\"  I lay there dead, and I had lost fair and square.\n\nBut being a real bad-loser, I reloaded\n\nI made sure to not look at the crowd, I had no idea why i did that. Paranoia maybe? But I went by myself while Harald went to the keep. Suddenly I drew my sword and ordered some of the guard to come to the keep with me, and who did I find there but Harald and Despin. I enjoyed the day that I tortured Despin, but wept the day I executed Harald. His last words were, \"Glory to Swadia!\" He shouted, and for some reason that phrase sounded very similar...\n  ",

        "text": "[The Asshole Patrol was not having a terribly good day.](http://redd.it/32cbx6) One of their former members, a summoner, had turned on them and was assaulting everything with seemingly-endless waves of T-rexes. The Patrol was equipped for this, but a lot of other places weren't, and at some point, the party had to kill the man responsible for all the chaos- the traitorous Sleazeball. But going up against a level 20 sorcerer was kind of a big deal, especially when [the Patrol's most capable fighter had his legs bitten off and was currently in a coma](http://fav.me/d8rc4pt).\n\nThings looked a bit grim, but [the party (Pratena the punchy cyclops, Rose the dullahan ranger, Barrel the halfling rogue, and Thoth the shabti magus)](http://imgur.com/a/1azWs) hadn't given up hope. And Partyboss, the woman in charge, had a plan- to go raid a crypt with a powerful magical artifact in it. Magic Macguffins, ho!\n\nThe party immediately set off to the ancient crypt/temple/whatever, marvelling at the novelty of a thousand-year-old ancient structure that HADN'T only been there for the past week. Unfortunately, it was occupied by a squadron of dullahans. Typical. But fortunately, the party had experience with this stuff- especially Rose. The dullahans weren't so much voluntary guards as puppets of their programming, and therefore, as heroes, it was the party's job to deactivate said programming, preferably without killing anyone.\n\nThe biggest problem was the massive dullahan captain in the entryway, unflinchingly watching and waiting for intruders to enter. But, seeing as how it wasn't in any sort of cover, the party hatched a plan to disable it- if they could hit it in just the right spot, and do just enough damage, they could deprogram it without a fight. To this end, the party MacGuyvered a crude ballista with an ornamental stone sword, a two-ton stone column, and abuse of the True Strike and Force Punch spells. They set it up right outside the entrance, in plain view of the dullahan captain, and sent Rose in to lure said captain closer. \n\nNow, if you could imagine this next part accompanied by the Benny Hill chase theme, that would be great.\n\nCaptian dullahan lived through being impaled, and was suitably pissed. It, and every other dullahan in the crypt, charged forward. With a lucky roll, Rose stole the captain's weapon (by getting it wrapped around her shield). Pratena tried to stop this from becoming a collosal fuckup by trying to bash the captain with a stone column (which, conveniently, was large enough to jam up the entrance of the crypt), and promptly got into a tug of war match with the dullahan captain, while reinforcements started to trickle in. Just about everyone was screaming. Rose then used Named Bullet and her own personal arm cannon to shoot off one of the captain's limbs (while thanking the gods of the holy sourcebook that named bullet prevents misfires). Now, they had another problem- the downed captain was sitting right in the entryway to the freaking crypt, pinned in by the giant stone column that Pratena had wedged in there specifically so that nobody could get out of the crypt. Rose was currently inside said crypt.\n\nWith a lot of screaming, furious spellcasting, and cursing, the party wrangled the two-ton stone column out of the damned entryway, Rose grabbed the inert remains of the captain dullahan, and everyone ran for their lives as the dullahan reinforcements arrived. Rose ran as fast as her clanky, overburdened legs could take her. Now there was a new problem- the entrance of the crypt was open again, and reinforcements were streaming out of it. So Pratena hurled the fucking stone column into the entrance of the crypt, AGAIN, and proceeded to play two-ton-hot-potato with a couple of beefy dullahan soldiers while the party cheered her on. She finally overcame the opposition, and once more sealed the entrance of the crypt.\n\nWhich was just about when Sleazeball's summoned monsters broke through a side-entrance and burst in, intent on destroying all of the treasure before the party could get to it. Oh, and just to recap, the party had just sealed the main entrance with a two-ton stone column. Again.\n\n\"FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK\"\n\nOnce more, Pratena played the role of Mobile Dump Truck and wrangled the damn column out of the entrance, just in time for everyone else to see a big rush of dullahans to the side entrance. The party waded in to lend assistance, in defense of their potential loot (and also the numerous enslaved dullahans, *of course*), and found the side-entrance being completely flooded with summoned monsters. But the trouble was, Sleazeball was a rather unimaginative summoner, and just about every creature was large enough to completely clog the hallway. Rose hacked a path clear, and Pratena leapt in, easily demonstrating why it's awesome to be a hasted Large-sized brawler with 30 STR, Longarm Bracers, and the [Pummeling Charge](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/pummeling-charge-combat) feat. Because the summons could only attack one at a time, and there was a wall of heavily-armored dullahans between them and Pratena, the resulting fight was an outright slaughter. It might have been easier for the poor summons if they had just ran, at full speed, headfirst, into Pratena's outstretched fist.\n\nAt this point, Barrel (who had previously been supporting the \"battle\" by hiding under Greater Invisibility and stabbing the T-rexes in their exposed genitals) sensed something amiss, and ran off to, ahem, *secure the treasure*. This turned out to be an excellent idea, because while everyone was distracted by the rapidly-dwindling horde of T-rexes, the front entrance had been infiltrated by [Configu- Confiter- Cofintger- LARRY](http://imgur.com/EL5p0dU) the killer rat, [Sleazeball's second-favorite summoned monster](http://redd.it/2nl60x). And he was about to dissolve all of the loot in the treasure room with his new power of Acid Breath. There followed an incredibly one-sided battle, as Barrel was still under the effect of Greater Invisibility, and Rose's cat was an excellent flanking partner. Thus, the abomination that was ~~Confite~~ LARRY was slain, and started to melt and dissolve. Which was fucking weird, because summons usually just vanished on death.\n\nSummons dead and loot secure, Pratena set about \"accidentally\" dismantling the dullahans that were aggressive on-sight, and then she and Rose set about freeing all of the passive ones by crushing the instructions written on their arms (by, of course, crushing their arms). With that, the new fleet of Lefty Dullahans expressed their eternal gratitude for being released from their restrictive programming, and rabbited the fuck away. The party found the artifact they were looking for (Which wasn't even in the freakin' treasure room, it was in the armory), filled their various Bags of Holding with copious quantities of loot, and left with various parts of their anatomy held high. Rose got giddy over her personal haul, which was the artifact that the whole raid had been about- the [Summoner's Sorrow](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/specific-magic-weapons/summoner-s-sorrow). It had been a very good day.\n\nBut before they headed home and started the final battle, they had to make a quick stop by the nearby forest...\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"Fun with blood rituals\", ATTACK OF THE LEAF MOLD AND HAVE YOU CHECKED YOUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY?](http://redd.it/3b7igg)",

        "text": "Last year I DM'ed a pretty long campaign for five friends using the 5e playtesting rules. The party had been hired by a university to locate an ancient library that had long ago been buried beneath the desert sands. To find it, they needed to locate the four \"keys\" (which turned out to be ancient artifacts of varying types that had to be activated). The party was dogged throughout the campaign by a fanatical cult that claimed the library was actually an ancient temple to Ioun, the Goddess of Knowledge, and contained such vast amounts of knowledge and power that no mortal could ever be allowed to locate it.\n\nThe party consisted of a human bard, a gnome wizard, a tiefling fighter, a warforged fighter, and a halfling druid. The bard and the wizard were partners in crime and had been conning people at every turn prior to the start of the campaign. The tiefling fighter was a (somewhat) corrupt lawman determined to capture them and the warforged was a bounty hunter who'd been hired on to help. The halfling was searching for an artifact to save her forest, which turned out to be one of the keys. But I digress. To sum up, the campaign opened with the two fighters capturing the con men and conscripting them into the mission, which they'd been hired onto initially as bodyguards. The halfling tagged along because of the artifact.\n\nThroughout the campaign, I'd been dropping hints that the party weren't the only ones seeking the library. There were rumours of demonic and angelic activity that indicated that what lay buried beneath the sand was far more important than the university knew. The party kept this in mind and was on the lookout for any confirmation of the threat.\n\nCue the third key.\n\nThe party enters a cave system infested with kobolds. A hissing voice on the wind makes it very clear that the kobolds aren't in control of themselves. The party treks deep into the caves to find the artifact (a magical pillar) and discovers that it's being guarded by three devils in the form of giant snakes. I'd rolled up some really neat stats for them, expecting the party to charge right in (their usual plan).\n\nInstead, the wizard sees the pillar and says, \"Let's make a deal.\"\n\nInternally, I swear to myself. I have nothing written for this. But I decide to improvise. The wizard, much to the discomfort of the rest of the party, trades the location of the previous keys in exchange for the secret of this key. The devils agree and head off, ultimately discovering the location of the library and beating the party there for a final showdown.\n\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nThe party unlocks the key and heads off in search of the fourth key. They find it--an altar--in the depths of a haunted wizard's tower. It needs magical blood energy to unlock it, and the wizard's tower was filled with summoning circles and all sorts of demonic and angelic lore, so they decide to summon some sort of blood demon and kill it, then use its essence on the altar. They summon the demon, kill it with some difficulty, then head back to the altar room to activate the altar.\n\nThe wizard had taken the worst of the hits during the fight, but in his usual cocky, cheery nature declines to waste hit dice since \"they'd just beaten the final boss.\" They toss the demon's blood on the altar. It activates, revealing a secret escape route to avoid the terrors and traps of the wizard's tower. The escape route is an incredibly steep staircase that goes straight downwards.\n\nThe party is immediately mobbed by shrieking spirits that pour from the altar and the walls. Still injured, they flee down the staircase at a high speed.\n\nThen the wizard crit fails his athletics check to keep his footing. He falls. I roll damage. Not a lot (it's a staircase and not a sheer drop, after all), but enough to hurt.\n\nI roll nearly max. And he's already wounded. He falls unconscious. And keeps falling.\n\nEach time he hits the stairs, I roll damage again.\n\nAnd again.\n\nAnd again.\n\nThe halfling druid shifts into bird form and dives. She manages to get underneath the tumbling wizard. She makes a check to catch him and succeeds. The wizard stops falling with 1 hit point left above negative his total HP (I don't remember if instant death at negative your total HP was a 5e playtesting thing or a house rule we were using).\n\nThe druid sets him down and casts some healing spells to stop him from dying. We all start breathing again. The wizard's player looks up and says, \"I think that's going to leave a mark. What should happen?\"\n\nWe all go around the table tossing out ideas. \"Scar,\" says one person.\n\n\"Limp.\"\n\n\"Forgetfulness.\"\n\nHalf-jokingly, I say, \"Alignment change.\"\n\nThe player looks over at me and says without hesitation, \"I wake up as a lawful good paladin.\"\n\nHe then proceeds to give an epic speech, in character, as his wounded gnome gets to his feet. He tells the party of how the sun reached out and saved him, how he'd always known that his faith would be rewarded one day. He stares at his wizard robes in confusion and demands to know where his armour and holy weapons have gone.\n\nIt's at this point that we all realize that his character is convinced he's always been a paladin. He remembers nothing of his previous deeds, of his former life as a con man.\n\nThe warforged stage-whispers to the rest of the table, \"Don't tell him.\"\n\nWe ruled that the gnome's devotion to the sun god would allow him to re-do his character sheet as a paladin. He also had enough gold kicking around to buy some plate armour, and the two halves of an angelic sword they'd located at various points in the campaign became a side-quest to forge them into a new holy sword for him. All was set for the final showdown at the library.\n\nYou can imagine the paladin's shock when the devils told him about his deal with them.",

I'm going to make it!”\n\nA bright blue flash catches his eye as the ship turns.\n\n“Oh god no!”\n\nHe screams as he gets pushed through the spelljammer's psychic engine.\n\n“WEEEEOOOOOOOHHHHH!”\n\nThe thruster pops loose and shoots high in the air. A blue explosion shimmers and then it is rocketed down into the freighter, cutting it in half and capsizing the back cargo units.\n\nNexus sees the rest of the ship racing around the horizon.\n\n“Dammit!”\n\nThunk! Thunk! Thunk! Thunk!\n\nHe runs at full speed, making a heroic leap for the other side of the freighter. His arms windmill through the air as he comes down upon it. His hand grabs broken metal.\n\n“Gaaaahh!”\n\nHe turns his body to look at the wreckage while the ship whips around Wolf Zero. The capsized portion of the freighter goes nova.\n\nBOOOOM!\n\nHe disappears behind the event.\n\n(Jeremy, the player controlling the character that died, asked me if he could land on the cockpit if he was thrown. I told him I would let him make an acrobatics check in the air to try to direct himself towards his target. However, if he failed, he would hit a psychic engine. The game was being played at lvl 17, and the group decided to make the DC a 25.\n\nHe had second thoughts and decided to throw Phil, the player controlling the other character, instead. The result was extremely hilarious. Good times at the table)\n\n**Here is the part of the video where this took place:**\nhttps://youtu.be/j4ODxlYfTpA?t=2236 \n\n**This occurred last Friday in my From the Astral Game, a custom setting based on Planescape, Spelljammer, and some SciFi elements.**",

        "text": "Boja is a tall, very young elf from an affluent family that used every connection possible to get him accepted into the continent's greatest wizardry tower to hone his powers. He was popular and a savant in the wizarding ways but always had a big mouth that was luckily backed up with skill (or high rolls). Boja, being the \"cocky fuck\" (or at least according to the DM) he is, decided the tower could no longer benefit him with his magical growth and ventured out into the neighboring continent. Of course, he forgot to tell the headmaster, or leave a note, or even close the front door on his way out. In his travels he managed to recruit a bodyguard warrior half-orc named Caiaga by promising great rewards from his affluent family for keeping him safe. He forgot to mention that his family hates him and he never plans to return. With his caustic tongue and Caiaga's raw talent being the main attractions, they found themselves in the company of a paladin dedicated to finding Tom's wares, another half-orc warrior who cares more about stuffing his pockets with gems, and a rogue that wasn't there for the session. Thus begins the tale of our dumbassity protagonist. \n\nWhen leaving town through the north gate, the party was stopped by the guards saying that leaving through the north was a bad idea being that thugs, bad guys, and generally rude or ugly people have taken residence in a windmill on the road. Through a stroke of luck (and a nat20), Boja convinced the guards that he was off to save the town in selfless valiance, but not convincing enough to have them join the battle. With the gate opened and blessings from the guards, the party ventures forward. The windmill is protected by a river perpendicular to the road with a three person wide bridge to cross. Two large figures guard the bridge from the other side. It is midday and the figures cast noticeable shadows. Boja tries to speak to them in orcish but forgets basic words mid-sentence while the male half-orc stealthily walks across the river while under the bridge for a flank in case things go sour. The ogres begin to approach the party and ask \"what the hell did you just say\" in common. It turns out ogres don't natively understand orcish. With Boja hiding behind Caiaga the Meat Shield and preparing a spell, the paladin manages to bluff with saying Caiaga only speaks orcish. With deft conversation he convinces the ogres to permit the two of them (as Boja very dumbassedly remains in hiding) to pass the bridge in peace, letting the travelers walk past them. By some stroke of luck, the ogres forgot to peel the layer of stupid off their eyes and don't notice the tall idiotic elf with a lightning spell in his hands hiding between the two of them. As they left the bridge, the ogres stopped and watched to make sure they went about their unrelated business. Right around now, Boja realized the other half-orc was stuck hiding from the watchful ogres and couldn't regroup without being seen. Boja summoned his hawk familiar and had it snatch a fish to plop behind the ogres. They looked at it but not long enough for the half-orc to regroup. With great magical power, Boja mage handed the fish and slapped the ogres' heads. With great haste the two ogres turn and smash the fish with their clubs, leaving holes in the bridge. The half-orc successfully regrouped and the party makes it to the windmill with nary a scratch. ",

        "text": "So, some time ago, [The Glorious Chucklefucks](https://i.imgur.com/rOaUt25.jpg) were sailing across the ocean to get somewhere for the current quest line. Paelias and Shamus decided, during this journey, that it would be a terrific idea to fuck around with the Wabbajack and the Deck of Many Things. Shit happened, I don't remember all the details, but a coma knight got paralyzed and dropped into the ocean and then shot with the Wabbajack, which spawned a massive storm. Some checks were failed, while some were passed (see Paelias, Garg, and NPC ally Duncan running on water to catch up with the ship like sprinter Jesus), and the ship wrecked on an uncharted island in the middle of the ocean.\n\nOfftoagoodstart.jpg.\n\nAfter the PCs get their shit sorted and take stock of the wreckage (the crew had all died, most of their supplies were gone) they set about exploring the island. Pretty soon, they find a village of primitive tribesmen, with whom Noel is able to communicate thanks to some horseshit feat about languages. The villagers are friendly and hospitable, so Garg and Shamus decide to stay with them while the others go out to explore the jungle further inland. While I describe a number of spooky things encountered by the group in the jungle, I also talk about the celebration back in the village in which Garg and Shamus were participating. At one point, just for laughs, I mention that the two were given some \"special mushrooms\" to eat. I expect to give a funny description of our straight-laced avenger and lovable ogre getting high for a bit, have some giggles around the table, and move on. But then Donovan, after having Garg eat the shrooms, asks me a question I did not expect.\n\n\"Is it a bad trip?\"\n\nI pause. It is a good question. \"Roll for it.\"\n\nHe rolls poorly. Spencer rolls for the quality of his trip and gets an only slightly better result. I decide to just fucking go with it, and declare that the two are both having a bad trip.\n\nSo now these poor bumblefuck villagers have a holy warrior and a massive ogre tripping balls in the middle of their big festival, which goes about as well as you might expect. Both perceive everyone around them as terrifying zombies, to which they respond by fucking killing everyone. Garg bursts out of the hut housing the celebration (through the wall, because fuck doors) and spreads the slaughter elsewhere, while Shamus starts a fire and ends up burning down half the village. The sounds of the carnage draw Friedrich and the others back, and as soon as the paladin gets close the two instantly become sober again (due to Friedrich being a Buzz Kill, which is a story for another day) and realize what they've done. Garg, distraught, runs off into the jungle, while Shamus falls to his knees and looks in despair at the innocents he has murdered. Friedrich, seeing the destruction without the context of the drugs, needs little convincing to grant Shamus's implicit request: that he be executed for his crimes. With a clean stroke, he severs the avenger's head, then goes to seek out Garg.\n\nAfter confronting the ogre in the jungle, Friedrich learns of the drugs which incited the massacre, leading him to forgive Garg for the crime. The villagers are likewise understanding, as the mushrooms have been known to cause such negative effects in the past, and they acknowledge that giving them to a nine-foot-tall killing machine was probably a bad idea. The party later discovered a portal to take them off the island, leaving Shamus's remains behind. Shrooms, kids. Not even once. \n\nBizarre? Yes. But it's just business as usual for these chucklefucks.",

        "text": "I have an \"experienced\" tabletop group that has played D&amp;D, Shadowrun, and Alternity together for about 4 years now. We recently made the switch to Pathfinder. Here's what went down:\n\nThey stumbled through the first part of the abandoned monastery; the rogue wandering down the hall after thinking he adequately checked the fountain room and critically failing his stealth roll against a group of dire rats while the rest of the group were surprised by the shock lizards hiding in the fountain. They failed to spot the room sized trap and were almost squished to death near the fountain. They limped along through the rest of the floor and arrived at the Forge Spurned's (Herein FS) chamber (I removed a couple encounters to keep them from getting slaughtered so they could get to the big baddie at the end of the first floor).\n\nThe fight was at least swift, but not the least bit painless. FS was second on the initiative and began with the bellowing breath to blind and burn a 20 foot radius around him. The ranger was the only one to fail her saving throw and became blinded. The rest of the group tried to tough it out in the fire while beating on FS. By round 2, FS was low enough to decide to chain someone and drag them away. The bloodrager was closest, did a lot of damage, and looked pretty beat up from the fire, so he chained him, knocking him unconscious, and began to drag him away. The Warrior failed an AoO, and the rogue managed a measly 4 damage.\n\nKeep in mind, we use CritGen as a house rule for crits and fails for more variety and fun.\n\nThe warrior tried to charge FS to save the bloodrager, critically failed, and managed to stab himself. The alchemist tried to hit him with a bomb (FS is immune to fire). Ranger whiffed, but luckily the pet had an attack! The spinosaurus ran in and critically failed. Luckily, the fail mod that rolled was deal damage to target, but receive double from target. Enough to kill FS, but down the dino. Everyone gets stabilized and brought back to at least 1 HP.\n\nAfter people take a look at the loot, the warrior decides that the cursed soul chain is something he needs to wield, and grabs it to try and use it. Roll a will save to overcome the evil and control the soul chain. Warrior's roll: 1. \n\nImmediately the warrior begins to turn to a Forge Spurned himself and the group goes into a panicked frenzy. No one knows if they should run or fight. Their friend, near death to begin with, is consumed and begins a horrible undead transformation. The rogue decides to put him out his misery and goes in for the attack. Rogue's roll: 1.\n\nNow the rogue is unconscious from taking fire and thorns damage from the chains and epically failing his roll, but at least the ranger is there to save the day and put the warrior down.\n\nBest part, we had a new player completely new to table top joining us tonight, waiting to be rescued in the next room. His first statement: \"Can I wait for the next adventuring party?\"\n\nMFW: http://i.imgur.com/qoFsZXB.png\n\nA night of critical failures to go down in the history books.",

        "text": "So I finally got around to finishing the editing on the third entry in the campaign log for my ongoing Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay campaign. This one is bite sized, beginning as our intrepid almost-heroes start wrapping things up in Pentus and continue with the caravan to the Dwarven seaport of Barak Varr. First, the characters:\n\nVebur Skullhammer, Dwarf Troll Slayer\n\nSwearing the slayer oath to die in battle after breaking the dwarven code of honor, Vebur is with the caravan following the path of his ancestor, who traveled to Araby centuries ago. And he might find some terrible monster to slay him along the way - unfortunately for him, dwarves are psychologically incapable of fighting to lose.\n\nAxel Muffins, Halfling Fieldwarden\n\nAxel was formerly part of a tight-knit group of scouts in the halfling homeland. His group was nearly destroyed by an encounter with the necromancer Dramesh. Axel, the only survivor, joined the caravan in search of new beginnings.\n\nRigg D'Elvagar, Human Tradesman\n\nRigg is a middle-aged man who grew up in a small village in the northern human Empire. Realizing he had reached his life's halfway point with nothing to show for it, Rigg apprenticed to an engineer by the name of Gregor Friemann, the caravan's resident technical expert.\n\nHelden Rommstagg, Human Apprentice Wizard\n\nHelden is a wizard who channels one of the eight winds of magic. His wind of choice is Shyish, the wind of death. As the senior apprentice of the Amethyst College, he was sent to investigate the disappearance of another Amethyst Magister by the name of Ludevicus, who vanished hunting down Dramesh.\n\nNikkel Roklept, Human Grave Robber\n\nBorn a peasant in the Empire, Nikkel's life was changed forever when his father abandoned the Roklept family, leaving behind a chest containing a stack of encrypted maps and a decoding tool, encoded in an unknown language. Nikkel was able to figure out that his father had headed in the direction of Araby, and joined the caravan to pursue the mystery.\n\n**Interlude 1: The Bloody Road to Barak Varr**\n\nWith the city of Pentus (more or less) saved, the party set about wrapping up their affairs and moving on. Erica wrote to the College of Light in Altdorf, requesting they come and excavate and quarantine the warpstone deposits. This request was cleared by Jurgen, acting as interim regent. He also provided the party with a much appreciated gold stipend for their troubles. \n\n*PCs being PCs, they still maintained a healthy level of interest in profit, even with potentially more pressing matters looming....*\n\nAt that point, there was nothing left to do but head onwards to Barak Varr, where Marcus planned to book passage on a ship to Araby. Unfortunately, there would have to be slight detour. While the Orc Waagh! was in the process of dispersing, there were still far too many greenskins to risk taking the old Arabyan lift down the cliff to make better time to the dwarfhold. So, the Second Kraus Expedition set out along the old cliff-side path, a little-used route that would take nearly a month to traverse. The first night of their journey, the party stumbled across a curious sight. A graveyard-but with all the corpses dug out and coffins broken open...from the inside. The agitated keeper of the yard, after ascertaining that the party wasn't a threat, informed them that a cloaked man had come there yesterday eve, and begun chanting and gathering foul magicks. The keeper, afraid for his life, hid, and only emerged to witness the procession of self-exhumed bodies marching away. The party suspected this to be the work of Dramesh, who was apparently gathering an undead legion, if his work in Pentus was anything to go by. Setting out to rejoin the expedition, the party was rudely interrupted by a black coach thundering up the road. After diving for cover, the party noticed that the coach was completely curtained off, and its driver was shrouded in rags. Axel uneasily recalled folklore that black coaches were used to transport vampires while they slumbered.\n\n*The encounter with the gravedigger was a small triumph in getting the party into the proper Warhammer frame of mind; namely, being appropriately paranoid after dark. Also, Axel and Helden finally got to use their Knowledge(Necromancy) skills.*\n\nContinuing on the road, following the tracks of coach wheels and dead footsteps, they met a hideous sight. The next town they came across was devastated-houses smashed and burnt, blood spattered across the dirt, and bodies staked in morbid witness. Not very many bodies, however. And the tracks they were following seemed to have grown in number. After taking the bodies down, the caravan left the gruesome tableau behind, continuing to follow the tracks of the necromantic legion-and came across another devastated settlement with a distinct lack of corpses. And another, and another, and another... The party raced ahead of the caravan after the swelling corpse-horde, always a day behind, when they reached the last settlement before Barak Varr. It was the same scene the party had grown jaded to-except for Helden, who perceived with his witchsight a spark of Jade magics.\n\n*Get it? I'm so funny, ahaha. Anyway, the party really did try to overtake Dramesh and his armies, but they were already a day behind when they left, and the undead don't need to sleep.*\n\n Curious as to why the wind of life would be noticeable among such death, he delved into the basement of one of the gutted homes. There, he found a young girl, catatonic from the horrors she had witnessed, but possessing a dim whisper of Jade magic-a promise of future potential as a magister. Helden carried the girl out of the ruins of her home, and with the help of Anastasia's matronly care got her settled in the expedition. With that, the party finally came upon Barak Varr. The tracks of the dead and the coach forked south, into the Badlands-a truly inhospitable place Marcus had no desire to lead the caravan into. The party put the legions of the dead out of their minds for the time being, and ventured forth to a task even more daunting than chasing the armies of the damned-negotiating with dwarves.\n\nAnd there's the first interlude of the campaign. Next up, dwarves and swamps and ruins and witches, oh my.  ",

        "text": "Having now been supplied and well rested, our heroes set out to Kyoto. The first stop is in a small village outside of Nagoya. Upon arrival in the small village, the troupe realizes something – they have no idea where they're going. So, they ask around for help.\n\nAfter some prodding and information gathering, the gang learns of a cartographer in a nearby forest and decides to head off to visit her. Right before they enter the forest, however, a villager approaches the group and offers each member a cup of golden sake, claiming it will help us see mushi, or Japanese spirits of folklore. Most of us take of the sake, and the results are interesting.\n\nOur first reaction was Yamaha, who simply looked at the cup after drinking it, and asked for more, believing it made him drunk and he was now seeing things. Rayet, on the other hand, did *not* believe she was drunk, and was shaken in her beliefs because, as I *may or may not have neglected to mention*, she was a Jesuit. Lee just didn’t take the sake, as he didn’t believe in spirits and cared not for something that might make him see them. Yamaha then promptly took Lee’s cup.\n\nHaving now protected themselves from the mushi, our group trekked into the forest. After a fairly long walk, mushi within sight the whole time, the group arrived at the hut where the cartographer was supposed to be. Upon meeting her, they soon realize that she is a mushishi – a Japanese witch doctor that specializes in mushi. She will help the group with their dilemma, if they help her with something.\n\nAfter our motley crew agrees to help her, she leads us outside to a koi pond. Yamaha and Rayet both see a shadow in the pond, which the mushishi points out, alongside a koi fish that is white and missing an eye. The mushishi says that a mushi residing in the pond did that, and that she wished to research it more thoroughly.\n\nLee characteristically rolled his eyes, and Rayet remained wary of the pond. Yamaha, on the other hand, did *not* believe the mushishi, and was soon issued a challenge to walk into the shadow mushi. Rayet remained on the edge of the pond, expecting a monster to attack Yamaha in some fashion. Sure enough, once Yamaha walked into the mushi, he vanished. Seeing this and believing the mushi teleported him somewhere to attack him, Rayet charged into the pond with her sword drawn. She too disappeared. Soon afterwards, they re-emerged, both sporting white hair, a missing eye each, *and amnesia*.\n\nYamaha, upon learning that she tricked him, was furious. He demanded that the mushishi fix him. She replied that there was no known cure, which only made Yamaha more angry. Upon becoming further enraged, Yamaha picked up the mushishi and prepared to toss her into the mushi, thinking she was at fault here. He failed to notice, however, that the mushishi also had white hair and a stunning lack of an eye. By the time we reached him, however, it was too late. He threw the mushishi in and she disappeared forever.\n\nHaving now killed our best shot at getting healed, our group turned to the mushishi’s house, looking for a map and possible clues to our cure. Upon finding the map and not finding any clues to our restoration, we sought to leave. Yamaha setting the house ablaze. We then exit the forest, now headed along the path to Kyoto.",

When we play with voice chat, I will almost always call for an early invade, for the sole reason that if we move as a 5-man unit, we have little danger of encountering the other team grouped up and ready to fight us.\n\nIn this particular game, I was playing Karma support, on the red side. Our Udyr jungler said that he had to go take care of something, so he went AFK in our jungle. The rest of our team consisted of a Jinx, Mundo, and Teemo mid. We secured positions around the enemy red buff, and then their Lee Sin found me, apart from my team. He hit me with a Q, and he followed it up. I wasn't too far from my team, so we were able to deal a decent amount of damage to him. He managed to retreat back to his second-tier tower, and we had all used our skillshots, so we were about to give up on the kill, despite him being almost dead. Then our Mundo landed a max-range cleaver underneath the tower. \n\nFirst blood.\n\nAt this point, the rest of their team had begun collapsing in on us. We quickly regrouped and began pulling away, since some of us had taken damage when we were focused on Lee Sin, and Jinx and I had taken tower shots. Udyr was still AFK in our jungle.\n\nWe began retreating, landing skillshots, but the enemy kept coming after us. After they had taken a bit of damage, I realized that we could actually fight them. We turned, and in the end, we walked into lane with 2 kills for Mundo, 2 kills for Jinx, 1 kill for Teemo, and 1 kill for me. Their Katarina did get the shut-down on Mundo near the end of the fight, but we started the game with a 6-1 advantage.\n\nThe rest of the game was a stomp. We didn't play too seriously, and the enemy Katarina did end up getting a quadra kill in one teamfight. But we were so far ahead that we were able to keep increasing our lead, and the enemy surrendered after 22 minutes.\n\nThis is why we invade.\n\n[Game, for those interested.](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1818747172/38373499?tab=overview)",

After a very quick conversation we found out he had just been sick and staying at home while he got better. \n\nSo to recap a man was sick enough that he was staying home when a man who likes a bit like a walking corpse kicked in his door, shoved a gun in his mouth, and demanded to know where the girl he had been crushing on was.\n\nAt least that time I didn’t maim anyone.\n",

But he could also help by being another support player who ran flag while being guarded etc. (Calling him ***E**)\n\nIt's a fairly even game throughout until around the 35 kill mark the other team pulls ahead by 7. We go back and forth evenly until it's **42-49** them.  I get a double kill by grenading the lifts and **L** wins a 1v1. **45-49**. \n\n[Contsruct](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20071106202406/halo/images/9/9d/9972836-Full.jpg) Each lift you see took you up to a medium sized room (or a bigger area if you came up Gold). The closer lift in the image is Open street lift (\"Open Purple\" in MLG talk), and the other one was closed street lift (\"Closed Purple\"). For the purposes of this, let's pretend I remembered correctly. If you controlled the top level of the map, the people spawning from bottom were at a disadvantage because they would get naded and dueled from the second they lifted up to the top level. Furthermore, from the lift rooms you could see down what was called \"Open street\" and \"Closed street\" which were the walkways between Gold lift (at the back of the map) and the two purple lifts. \n\nSensing we *might* be able to pull this off, **E** and myself are on Closed Purple, **L** was on the other lift, and **R** held the Gold Lift. The other team sends two on my lift and one up Gold. **E** throws two grenades and supporting fire and we dispatch the first guy as the second comes up. I throw both my grenades as soon as I can so the second comer's shields will be down. I stay behind cover (a post about 50% wider than Chief) until I can help **E**, who finishes up the kill. **47-49**. \n\n**R** loses his shields fighting on Gold lift, but wins his 1v1 as well. **48-49**. At this point we're all really excited since we need two kills to pull off an 8 point comeback. \n\nI send **E** to cover Gold lift as well, since it's the lift most teams try to come up en masse. The other team is scrambling at this point and only one player comes up Gold and loses the 2v1. **49-49**. We're all yelling excitedly now. I move off the purple lift and see the last kill on bottom mid, with no cover around. I shoot from Closed Street and drop down to get closer and finish it. I land next to him and melee for the win. **50-49**\n\nTo this day it's the best comeback I've ever had and we still talk about it when we reminisce about gaming haha. Sorry if I'm a sucky writer, thanks for reading though guys!! \n\nedit: Added a link for a visual aid and shortened for some clarity.
