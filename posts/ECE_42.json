I'm having trouble understanding the preamp's gain options - it gives me adjustable output sensitivity options in [V/Pa] and allows me to input the transducer sensitivity in [pC/Pa]. \n\nThe Nexus manual says that gain is defined by output sensitivity / transducer sensitivity (which would be voltage sensitivity [V/Pa] * transducer capacitance [pF]), but I thought the whole point of a charge amplifier was that gain is independent of transducer capacitance? \n\nBasically I just need to know how many dB of gain the preamp is putting out so that I can correct the measured voltage from my scope. Really confused here, thanks for the help!",

        "text": "Currently, I have a ZC706 that is acting as a PCIe endpoint. I am able to read and write data to the endpoint using  Xilinx's XAPP1171 reference design. In addition, attached to the ZC706 is an ad9467 FMC ADC. I am able to capture data from the ADC and store it on the ZC706 DDR memory through DMA.\n\nMy next goal is to initiate data capture on the ZC706 endpoint ADC from a PCIe host. The host in question is a mini-itx Zynq board from Avnet. I was wondering how I would go about implementing this? A potential idea is to have an AXI slave control register on the endpoint, connected to an interconnect where the AXI masters are AXI memory mapped to PCI express. AXI CDMA and Zynq PS. From the host, an application in Linux userspace writes to this control register, where the zynq PS can periodically check to see if a bit is set for ADC data capture. If the register is updated, software on the endpoint will initialise the capture process. Once capture is complete, the endpoint resets the control register back to its default value, notifying the user application that capture is completed. With this solution, is there an available IP core in vivado or would I have to make my own slave AXI IP core to implement a control register?\n\nI would appreciate and be open to any feedback and suggestions :)\nCheers",

        "text": "Hi There!\n \nI'm looking for some help with interfacing my LPC812MAX board with the ESP8266 wifi module using UART. I've tested as much as I could but now I am stumped why the devices are acting the way they are. Here were my findings:\n \n1. I confirmed that the ESP8266 module is working and responding correctly. I confirmed this by connecting it directly to my computer using a TTL UART cable. With this, I was able to open up a serial communication channel and broadcast the command \"AT\" to the wifi module. It responded \"OK\" at a baud rate of 115200. Confirming both the baud rate as well as the functionality of the module.\n\n2. Using the output of serial session, I have confirmed the exact message (including line endings) that the ESP8266 module received in order to reply with \"OK\". \"AT&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.\n\n3. Next, I confirmed that my LPC812MAX board is sending that exact same message by connecting it to my laptop using the TTL UART cable. With this, I confirmed that the LPC812MAX board is communicating at a 115200 baud rate and sends exactly \"AT&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;&lt;CR&gt;LF&gt;.\n\nThe problem now is when I directly connect the ESP8266 to the LPC812MAX. Despite confirming the buad rate and the correct messages being sent, the ESP8266 does not respond. It only echoes back whatever I send to it.\n \nAnother interesting thing I noticed was that the ESP8266 might not initialize properly upon startup when connected directly to the LPC812MAX board. The reasoning behind this thought is because on startup, the ESP8266 sends over UART some gibberish followed by \"READY\". I can confirm this when connecting the ESP8266 to my computer. But this \"READY\" message is not received by the LPC812MAX board when I output everything it receives over it's UART bus. Am I missing some hardware between the LPC board and ESP8266 which is necessary for the UART communication?\n\nAny help would be appreciated! Thanks!",

I've seen the math for that, and the math makes sense...what I don't understand is why a basic envelope detector won't work for DSB-SC. \n\nIs it because of the phase reversal? Wouldn't the phase reversal have predictable effects though on the envelope? Wouldn't it double the frequency if a simple envelope detector was used, and couldn't one also just half the frequency again to correct for this?",

So my questions are to any Power Engineers familiar with the NY area: How is the job market for Power Engineers in NYC, if I want to work for a utility company such as con-ed?

At my school (UT of Arlington), they allow UG's to take some Graduate level classes as long as you meet certain conditions. There are 2 classes on Microprocessor systems and 2 classes on Computer Architecture that I definitely want to take. Outside of that, I don't see anything else that I'm highly interested in. If you were to pursue Graduate school, whats the general set up? Do you have to pursue some type of a degree, or can they allow you to pick and choose your classes of interest? My attitude right now is to finish school as fast as possible and get out so I can just start living life. It looks like a Master's Degree at any school would take at the very least another year of school, but I feel like if I can just take a few classes of interest, and get some immediate benefit from that in my career, its just not worth the extra time.",

I tossed the towel in and just started applying to software jobs, which gave me even more interviews than when I applied to firmware positions. This gave me my current job. The first 7 months were great because I got to code and work on a new project for the company. After the project was finished I'm just stuck writing documents and looking at spreadsheets and stuff, and I don't see any other project coming my way any time soon. I've been asking the higher ups for more work. We don't have any embedded related work here and I guess there isn't that much coding here either :(. At most now all I do is go back to some other code and fix a few lines here and there. \n\nThe problem I had before was that most embedded positions wanted years of experience, which I didn't, and still don't have. The software jobs were much more lenient about my lack of experience. Since I now have 1 year experience under my belt, does this make me a better candidate than I was last year, even if this position isn't embedded related? I programmed in C, C++, and Python mainly. Is it still worth applying to these same positions that I applied for in the past? Do I need to work on more personal projects? I don't want, but if I must... Then I must...

        "text": "First part is a silicon chip integrated circuit. Second part contains the data, encoded with tiny conductive patches and is placed on contact with the IC where it connects or not 2 wires depending on the bit. The data part does not have to be silicon or any other special material, contain any semiconductors or manufactured like ICs with photolitography. Some completely different fabrication method might be easier, cheaper and better.\n\nManufacturing and connecting the data parts can be done with less advanced technology in more places than the IC part. The data parts can be changed later, possibly with a consumer level device.\n\nThis is a possible alternative to once-writable storage chip. This is like a solid state version of a printed DVD or blu-ray when once-writable memory chip is a solid state version of a DVD-r.\n\n\nEDIT: the square area of the IC could be in contact with several smaller data mediums of different sizes. Any subset of existing data medium squares can be placed in there as long as they all fit within the larger square of the IC.",

I've been a systems engineer, software developer, and analog circuits designer.\n\nAt the moment I'm in a pretty bad situation, I'm in the part of the US that I want to be in (Austin), but the job I've accepted (~3 months ago) really isn't working for me, the industry and work content are boring enough that my performance is starting to be affected.\n\nDo you all have any advice for an engineer that has broad but not particularly deep work experience and technical expertise who is looking for a more permanent hardware focused role out here in Austin? I'm interested in an analog circuits related job but have not been able to find anything that fits my current skill level.\n\nI suppose my fallback plan at the moment is to brush up on my software skills and find a software job here, but I would like to stay in the electronics or computer hardware related field.\n\nApologies again, I know this reeks of first world problems.\n\nEDIT:\nJust another general question:\nAny advice on how to get my foot in the door for a position with a somewhat clear path to a specialized role, like maybe a \"high speed SERDES design\" or \"low voltage power electronics design\" role for instance?",

This n-type then goes directly to OUT... if B is also zero is where I get a bit confused, it seems it will loop, but the OUT will already have a positive voltage on it. Unless it's the parallel p-type and n-type gates in the middle doing something funky, I'm at a loss. \n\nAny help is appreciated. \n\nThanks!",

However, after resoldering it the bus still was stuck, however it's voltage is now 1.8V (Vcc = 3.3V).\n\nIs it possible that the chip was damaged?

        "text": "Sorry if this is not the best place to post this question, but I am planning on applying to grad schools soon and have been stuck on what to specialize in because I am interested in many different subjects. \n\nFor undergrad so far I have mainly taken elective courses over electromagnetics (antennas, waveguides, transmission lines), photonics, analog circuits, and RF circuits. After looking into jobs I just grouped analog and RF because they seem to be together for many jobs. I have done 1 semester of research with photonics (might continue senior year) and will soon be done with a summer of research which focused on analog, mixed signal, and RF circuits.     No research or internship related directly to antenna design or anything, but the courses I have had over the subject have been some of my favorite. \n\nI have a hard time deciding what to choose really because I like all of these specializations and would honestly be happy if I could one day have a job working with any of them. Because it is so hard to choose, I would like to know if anyone in these fields can say something about how the job outlook is, maybe even what type of work environment is typical. I don't have a geographic preference (happy anywhere) and maybe have a slight preference towards national lab or R&amp;D type jobs. Also I might go for a PhD after MS if I am feeling it, so if that can change up the outlook please let me know!\n\nTLDR: Job outlook for Analog/RF, Antenna, Photonics jobs with an MS? With a PhD? Which is best for national lab or R&amp;D?\n\nSorry for the long post, thanks for any help!",

I have a bachelors in neuroscience from an esteemed university and am currently working a public health job (I know, not relevant) but am deeply interested in both engineering and prosthetics. \n\nMy question is would electrical engineering be a good way to go to pursue this career path? I've heard both BME and electrical engineering are viable options to pursue a masters in, but I wanted to know which one would be better for building and designing them because thats what really interests me. \n\nThank you for any help!",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI'm tinkering around with OpenEMS, a free and open electromagnetic field solver, using matlab as a scripting interface.\n\nI'm not a huge expert in matlab or OpenEMS and am hoping someone here might know more. So I would like to simulate a horn antenna's electromagnetic field by modifying the template provided by the OpenEMS wiki [here](http://www.openems.de/gitweb/?p=openEMS.git;a=blob_plain;f=matlab/Tutorials/Horn_Antenna.m;hb=refs/heads/master)\n\nI am aiming to create a horn for use with 2.45GHz and am using the WR-240 standard for the waveguide, which means the inner dimensions of the horn are 86.36mm by 43.18mm. The template that I linked earlier is designed for a 15GHz frequency. By using the standard horn antenna equation I have been able to solve for the length and the outer dimensions of the horn (but the solver seems to calculate it later).\n\nThe only part of the code I've been editing is the portion below (I've commented the changes I'm making):\n\n    \n    %horn width in x-direction\n    horn.width  = 20;          %CHANGE USING WR340 (86.36)\n    %horn height in y-direction\n    horn.height = 30;          %CHANGE USING WR340 (43.18)\n    %horn length in z-direction\n    horn.length = 50;          %CHANGE USING VALUE CALCULATED\n    \n    horn.feed_length = 50;   %?\n    \n    horn.thickness = 2;\n    \n    % horn opening angle in x, y\n    horn.angle = [20 20]*pi/180;       %CHANGE USING CALCULATED ANGLES\n    \n    % size of the simulation box\n    SimBox = [200 200 200];\n    \n    % frequency range of interest\n    f_start =  10e9;       %CHANGE TO 2.4 TO 2.5GHz RANGE\n    f_stop  =  20e9;\n    \n    % frequency of interest\n    f0 = 15e9;            %CHANGE TO 2.45GHz\n    \n    %waveguide TE-mode definition\n    TE_mode = 'TE10';\n    a = horn.width;\n    b = horn.height;\n\nOne assumption I am making is that the horn.feed_length does not matter. However, once I change these values to to my calcualted ones, the far field pattern looks nothing like what a standard horn antenna should, it ends up looking something like [this](http://imgur.com/a/SY9QQ) instead of [this](http://imgur.com/a/zNiKq). Does any one have any idea why this is or maybe a factor in the code I'm not considering or have mention here.\n\nIf anyone needs any more information, just let me know and I'll edit it in asap.",

The valves will never be activated at the same time and will only be on for 90 seconds at a time.\n\nThis is one of my first designs and I am struggling to find a way to switch the load. I would prefer to use FETs, not relays. I have been looking at logic level gate FETs and haven't found a perfect match yet.\n\nWhat is the minimum Vds tolerance I should consider? Is 30V sufficient or should I be looking at something closer to 60V?\n\nDo I need to use any sort of gate driver because my MCU output is only 3.3V? My plan, thus far, has been to switch the ground side of the load with the N-channel MOSFET.\n\nI browse the datasheets (most of the logic level gate FETs that pop up on digikey are dual packages, which is convenient for my application) and look at the characteristic curves. **How do I determine what Vds will be?** When voltage is applied to the gate, I think of it as the switch being closed so it's hard for me to work out a voltage drop. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nFor all I know, some of the products I have looked at will work fine and I am just being too skeptical about the requirements. A couple of the products I have looked at are linked below; I thought this would be useful in case someone identifies that I am going down the complete wrong path.\n\nI would appreciate any advice on how I should proceed.
