        "text": "The survey I put out about a day ago received 18 responses. 83.3% of you wanted to switch to Reddit's official spoiler tag, while 16.7% of you wanted to keep both spoilers. None of you wanted to stick to just the old spoiler tag.\n\nAs a result, we now support Reddit's official spoiler tag, instead of the previous method.\n\nUse this for future spoiler tags: `&gt;!spoiler text between symbols!&lt;`\n\nThe old spoiler format still works, but Automoderator will nag you to start using the new format if you use it.\n\nOne small note with this new spoiler: Last I knew, there was a bug where having a space at the beginning or end of the spoiler made it visible to users of the legacy Reddit (https://old.reddit.com). As a result, Automoderator will remove your comment if you have a space at the beginning or end. Butt those symbols right up to the text. More plainly, **do not do this:** `&gt;!  spoiler !&lt;`, or your comment will be removed.\n\n\nPrior stickied post: https://www.reddit.com/r/riddles/comments/8tnxvi/meta_spoiler_tag_survey_what_spoiler_tags_should/",

He said teamwork was allowed in decoding it, which I did with a couple friends.\n\nHere's that code: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MM0IxTCsdqGnCjyltLVoDmLT\\_n8krcjSR0f8pUjYkX0/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MM0IxTCsdqGnCjyltLVoDmLT_n8krcjSR0f8pUjYkX0/edit)\n\nWe decoded it all, and eventually got to this. \"THE GATE OPENS AT LINE 23, THE TALE OF THE SIX CHAMBERS PEN\". We're completely running around in circles, but this is what we got.\n\n\\-A pen that has 6 chambers of ink\n\n\\-An SCP of some sort (I looked everywhere and couldn't find a thing)\n\n\\-A pen for animals that has 6 chambers\n\n\\-SCP-023 (Not sure why.)\n\nThe second code that we made our way to, said this.\n\n**\"(UNRELATED) Second hint: The translation to binary is not the answer. DELVE DEEPER.\"**\n\nAgain, the final puzzle is: \"**THE GATE OPENS AT LINE 23, THE TALE OF THE SIX CHAMBERS PEN**\". We're completely lost. I would appreciate any and all help, as I'm new to solving these sorts of things. I hope this falls under a lateral thinking riddle.",
