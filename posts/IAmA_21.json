        "text": "Hi folks, my name is Sam, I'm a member of the K-Storytelling Foundation and if you watch Korean TV, you might be familiar with my face. [Here's](https://goo.gl/Bv3Nfp) some proof, it's all in Korean but that's kind of unavoidable. Chances are that won't play outside of Korea, so [here's](https://www.liveleak.com/view?t=ur60K_1537841889) a recording of a recording.\n\nI'm not alone, though! There are others from Australia, Vietnam, and we’re eagerly expecting another Filipina storyteller to join us in a few hours. We’ve been here for three weeks now, and the program runs for the full month of September. Aren't we [stylish](https://i.imgur.com/sXVD3Vf.jpg)?\n\nThe region Sachon is based in is called Gyeongsangbuk-do. Despite having some of the country’s more populated cities, people have been leaving the area for several years, and there’s real concern that some villages are going to just vanish off the map entirely.\n\nSeveral local schools in Sachon have closed and been reopened as community centers, there are currently 12 students in the whole village, down from a high of 1,000. The reasons for this are the same reasons for population crashes in other industrialized Asian countries, the cost of educating a child in such a competitive environment have skyrocketed beyond the reach of most families, so people are putting off marriage and child-rearing for economic concerns.\n\nOne of the hopes for attracting international storytellers is to have them work a few hours each week educating area students, which should attract young parents to the village. The average age of the village is getting very near 50, without an influx of new blood there’s the very real possibility that Sachon will become a literal ghost town.\n\nThe regional government has actually been extremely active in preventing this, in years past they have helped construct two museums celebrating the history of the area, both as an agricultural powerhouse and as a hotbed of resistance against the Japanese occupation during the Imjin war. The house I’m staying in is actually immediately adjacent to a beautiful museum celebrating the “Uiseong Uibeong,” the “Uiseong Righteous Militia” which was comprised largely of Confucian scholars.\n\nThere are a LOT of Confucian schools in the area, and they’re some of the most breathtakingly beautiful architecture I’ve ever seen. It’s beyond gorgeous, like stepping onto the set of a historical drama. When it rains I keep expecting to see women in silk dresses gazing wistfully out across the horizon, but that’s just because I’m a sucker for wistful gazes.\n\nIf you happen to be a storyteller, the hope is to run 4-5 month-long residencies each year, with different themes. If that sounds like something you'd want to take part in, [follow us online](https://www.facebook.com/KStorytellingWorldTourProject/) for details on how to apply!\n\nAlso, we're going to be livestreaming a show on the 28th featuring some of our stories, and a performance by a traditional Korean musician. Feel free to [ask us questions](https://www.facebook.com/events/2153242884718121/) about the program or Korea in general!Last but not least, enjoy this [cat tax](https://i.imgur.com/LWa2Pcf.jpg).\n\nedit- feel free to ask other questions as well. Don't feel beholden to the commandment in the title.",

        "text": "Hello r/IAmA,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy name is Joel Haver and I've made movies since I was six years old. This year I graduated from film school. Throughout schooling, I learned that my strong suit was conceptualizing ambitious projects and playing into my limitations to execute them for dirt cheap. This allowed me to make three features and a webseries during my vacations and free time, capitalizing on the creative safety net allowed by school. I had tested the waters with festival submissions and distributors, but given just how cheap I was able to make movies for, it felt dishonest to go through this old world rigmarole. In a day and age where anyone can film anything and post it online, calling anything independent that jumps through extraneous hoops just to be seen began to sound like a bad joke. To avoid that bad joke, I decided to double down on my strong suit, and cut out the middle men. The logical step was to release all my work for free, in hopes that it will find an audience online.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's a little about my three features and webseries! Three of which are entirely viewable now for **free** and the fourth is releasing this weekend!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# [We Are Sasquatch](https://vimeo.com/222848730)\n\n*We Are Sasquatch* is my first feature film, made for just $200 with my childhood friends and family in my hometown throughout the summer of 2016. It's a mockumentary about a small town dance contest in the 90's, set in a world where Sasquatches are just hairy people who have been assimilated into human society. As one might expect, tensions between the humans and Sasquatches boil.\n\nWatch the trailer here: [We Are Sasquatch - Trailer](https://vimeo.com/222695681)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# [31 Days in Marshall, North Carolina](https://vimeo.com/286186006)\n\nIn July 2017, my friend Dylan Dexter and I went to a town we had never been to, where we knew no one, and lived in a trailer for the entire month. We had no preconceived notions and no script. While there, we made a movie with the people we met. This summer, we returned to screen the film in Marshall and over 200 people showed up from a town with a population of 800. The experience from beginning to end was amazing and I hope the film can capture that.\n\nWatch the trailer here: [31 Days in Marshall, North Carolina - Trailer](https://vimeo.com/283231108)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# [I'm Going to Be Famous](https://youtu.be/OMuDsueep9s)\n\nEasily my largest scale project to date, *I'm Going to Be Famous* consists of thirteen episodes shot over eight months and chronicles my real life journey to become famous before graduating college, by means of acting, stand up comedy, rapping, performance art and getting buff. This one is a real roller coaster that was constantly at the whim of the real world, if it seems like I'm just winging it then I probably was.\n\nWatch the trailer here: [I'm Going to Be Famous - Trailer](https://youtu.be/BQU88XR0-Q8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# [Taking a Little Time to Feel Sorry for Myself - Official Trailer](https://vimeo.com/287838929) - COMING SEPTEMBER 30TH\n\n*Taking a Little Time to Feel Sorry for Myself* marks my first time writing a feature length script! It tells the story of Bud, a clueless moron, whose relationship with his girlfriend Judith comes to an abrupt end and he has to learn to move on. Shot in my freetime throughout senior year, using equipment made available to me through my schooling, this film was made for just $10. You can see *Taking a Little to Feel Sorry for Myself* two days early on September 28th by becoming a $10 Patron!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here's the simple idea:** For the price of a movie ticket through Patreon, you will get early access to each movie prior to their ultimate free release. *Taking a Little Time to Feel Sorry for Myself* is the first movie to be using this system, but expect future releases' early access period to be more dramatic. All money raised through Patreon will go solely to bringing the next project to life. If successful, this will result in a beautiful situation allowed by the internet, where audiences can directly support the filmmakers with no middlemen. And best yet, the movies will ultimately be released for free, never permanently locked behind a paywall. So there'll be an ever-growing library of films to make the judgement call if that investment is worth it for you.\n\nRead more about that here: [https://www.patreon.com/joelhaver](https://www.patreon.com/joelhaver)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I'm able to produce for dirt cheap, these projects take forever, don't expect more than 2 a year on average! Check my Patreon for updates on projects in the works.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think the future of filmmaking is one of online self distribution with a direct connection between audience and filmmaker and if no one else has the gonads to welcome in that future maybe I'll have to!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ask me anything!**",

In 2016 I left Squad to pursue new projects, and created [Floating Origin Studios](https://floatingoriginstudios.com), my own dev shop. \n\nI am now working on a new game, which is just about ready for its first release into Early Access. Like KSP, it is also based on a childhood hobby of mine, Model Aviation. It is called [BALSA Model Flight Simulator](https://balsamodelsim.com).  \n  \n(now that I think about it, my parents were pretty chill about entrusting me with power tools...) \n\nI'm not here to plug though, I'm here to answer your questions about what was, what is and what will be, so ask away! \n\nCheers\n\nProof:\nhttps://truepic.com/awkwoewl\n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nIt's been a lot of fun, but it's time to wrap up now! Thanks to everyone who posted and I hope you guys enjoyed it as much as I did! We'll definitely do this again sometime soon!\n\nCheers",

Signing off for now, but keep any questions coming, we'll check back in here at later points!\n-\n-\n-\nFor a bit more information about the project and ourselves:\n\nFeeling there was an absence of historical western graphic novels, author Mark Lee Gardner and artist Nate Olson collaborated on adapting Mark’s original book into a graphic novel.  Meticulously researched, it's about the infamous James-Younger gang who terrorized post-civil war America. It deals with such themes as humanity's capacity for good and evil. \n\nMark: An award-winning historian, author, and musician, Mark Lee Gardner has appeared on the History Channel, PBS American Experience, ABC World News, AMC, the Travel Channel, NPR's All Things Considered, and BBC Radio to name a few.  He writes for both popular and scholarly audiences, such as The Daily Beast, American Heritage, Wild West, True West, New Mexico Magazine, and Journal of the West.  Mark's previous books include the critically lauded To Hell on a Fast Horse and Shot All To Hell.  He is currently researching famed Lakota leaders Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull for a dual biography. For more about Mark and his books: http://www.songofthewest.com/books.html\n\n\nNate: I’ve been working as a freelance artist for about the last five years. I've always been drawn (pun intended) towards the narrative side of art, but this is my first time working on a large graphic novel. \n     So why art? Philosophers from Plato to Schopenhauer have spoken of the power, majesty and meaning of art far better than I ever could. Just one \"for instance\" though of why I like art is it satiates my curiosity and indecisiveness. With a project like a historical graphic novel, I get to learn about another time and place, then in order to share that information I get to wear many hats. It’s like making a movie out of still images, and I research, compose, direct, light, choreograph and act all at the same time, just it's with a pencil! see some of my work follow this link: http://www.nateolsonart.com/graphic-novel/\n\n\n",

Since women earned the right to vote a little under one hundred years ago, our progress hasn't been the Olympic sprint toward gender equality first wave feminists hoped for, but more of a slow, elderly mall walk (with frequent stops to Cinnabon) over the four hundred million hurdles we still face. Some of these obstacles are obvious-unequal pay, under-representation in government, reproductive restrictions, lack of floor-length mirrors in hotel rooms. But a lot of them are harder to identify. They're the white noise of oppression that we've accepted as lady business as usual, and the patriarchy wants to keep it that way. I’m here to talk about all things #Feminasty, so ask me anything.
