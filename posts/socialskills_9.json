        "text": "I use self-checkouts so that I don't have to talk to cashiers and answer the question \"How are you?\" Since two days ago, I've been brutally honest when answering this question. How so?\n\nTwo days ago, instead of lying in bed all day (which was the plan), I decided I was going to buy a case of beer and play video games. Gas station clerk asks how I am and I respond \"Terrible.\" She's responds awkwardly that everyone feels that way once in a while. I say that I can't find a job in this town. As I leave, another clerk says \"Have a blessed day.\"\n\nThat's why I use self-checkouts and avoid cashiers.\n\nBut I also have been avoiding going to the gym for the same reason. \n\nWhen getting off of a bus, are you supposed to wave and say \"Thank you\"? That's what most people do. Lately I've just gotten off the bus without saying anything or looking at the bus driver.\n\nEh, all of this lends itself toward the autism diagnosis that I haven't been given because I can't get help for it. \n\nBut I'm also hesitant to talk to other people because of how my town is affected by the Seattle Freeze (how people are reserved and difficult to make friends with). Is it socially acceptable to strike up a conversation with people on the bus or at the bus stop? Because I only see a few people doing it, and whenever I seem to do it I get met with the awkward expression that I interpret as *\"Why is this person I don't know having a normal human interaction with me?\"*\n\nSo as a 31-year old man, I still don't know how to talk to people, and I've got an empty phonebook to prove it. What to do?",

And to join, you litteraly just show up and join in on the weekly meetings. I meant to join earlier this term but other stuff got in the way. But now I have the time to join. The issue is, we only have 2, maybe 3 weeks left of this term.\n\nI know I'll have time next term to join, and joining at the start of the term sounds less awkward to me instead of going to just two meetings before break.\n\nNext term starts in about a month.

This also happens in the workplace where I'm the new person and people assume I don't want to talk to them, because I'm usually pretty quiet and won't open up easily until I've adjusted to the job a bit more (usually after being there for a few weeks).\n\nI think it's caused some confusion with how I view myself from time to time as people will make comments about how I'm sweet, or super friendly even when I'm kind of quiet. I don't want to put too much emphasis on other's opinions of me, but I like being open to people's genuine input about aspects of my personality as it can help me to understand myself better.\n\nHopefully this makes sense, I just find that I have a certain level of awareness of myself to where I obviously understand that I'm not perfect, and in the past (mainly in my late teens and early 20s) I made some poor decisions when it came to dealing with certain people (mainly with friends that I used to have) and if someone crossed my boundaries or was pushy or pressuring me (This could range from them trying to convince to go out with a certain guy to looking into a certain career path I had little interest in.) I found myself being kind of snappy and rude sometimes.\n\nI get that this is something that a lot of people have dealt with, but I sometimes lack perspective on this, as there's been times where when I was more confident I had stronger boundaries and found myself being a lot nicer, and when I was more vulnerable, found myself being kind of rude which I don't like.\n\nAny insight on this will be appreciated, thanks :)",

But now since I am older in college, it has gotten better but when you grow up with something, it sticks and essentially becomes part of you.\n\nBut it's still here nonetheless. I am always stressing out about stuff like my roommates having a secret groupchat behind my back, or not having much friends or them forgetting about me. I can have fun and be with people but I always have to be the one to reach out to do stuff and whatnot (and chances are we end up doing stuff) otherwise no one does and I am alone.. which I guess pick your poison? \n\nI am already stressing about this fall with all the events, parties, socializing, etc... which is literally 6 months out, which is awhile. \n\nI am trying to fix this fomo and anxiety and stop overthinking about things but it is just hard when you grow up experiencing it and continue to do so when you're older. I've grown a lot as a person too but this is a factor will take time to fix. How do I deal with this meanwhile? I also can't just make people remember me and stuff.\n\nThoughts, advice?

I do understand that people aren’t always ready to give a lot of details about their life without an adequate amount of time having gone by, but I feel like I’m shouldering everything- even on days she starts the conversation first. It’s getting to the point where I want to reply less and less because I already know it’s going to be “lol”, “lmao,” “nice,” or “wyd.” That’s literally it.\n\nAsking people I know irl how to handle it has led to suggestions of “just tell her” to “ghost her” to “try to meet her where she is.” Meeting her where she’s at (at the moment, unsure if this is where she’ll be or if there's more to come) means I have to be wildly untrue to myself and act like I don't know things, or more realistically I have to shove down my interests because\n\"lol nice\", “lol huh”, “lol cool”, is all I get back.\n\nI’m from WA, she’s from MS, and I’ve been trying so hard to not let any sort of geographical bias get in the way of who I befriend but it just feels like they don’t value the same stuff I do (that being education) and I’m getting frustrated having to reword everything I say. I say “they” because since moving to Texas for school I’ve met multiple people from the Deep South both my age and older than me that have no clue about anything I’m talking about… I don’t mean to generalize but I’m getting so frustrated. Like, if you're going to start a dialogue with me (especially if it's something I'm super interested in) then either be ready to respond or ask questions or something.

This is my bounce back year. I’ve been in therapy, developing healthy habits, raising my self esteem, planning my goals, and getting back to myself. \n\nThe issue that I’m having right now is that I’m incredibly isolated. I’m an extrovert and for some reason I’ve gotten into a toxic cycle of staying home all the time. \n\nI drifted from my old friends and I’ve changed so much that I wouldn’t have anything in common with them anymore. I’m self employed and my work is online. I attend college online because campus is far from my home. \n\nIt seems like this has become the norm for a lot of people but this is honestly making me sick. I have no idea where or how to start socializing again. I miss going out and talking to whoever I came across and just being relaxed in public. I thrive when I’m actively social and I feel so stuck and lonely because of my isolation. It’s holding me back from being my best self. \n\nI guess my question is how do I get back out there? How do I get back into the habit of socializing? Is this a confidence issue? What can I start doing to improve?",

I feel like even my college female friends intimidate me and there’s some kind of a wall there, and I’ve just always defaulted to friendships with men because it just felt familiar from a tomboy childhood and having “guy hobbies” but I really want fulfilling female friendships as well.

During my interview I thought my boss was nice and modern. I was happy to start. \n\nTo keep it short, I hate him. I cannot stand him and I get annoyed when I have to look at him. \n\nThere’s two reasons: 1. he is an insufferable know it all. We are only a team of 4 people. Everyone has very different responsibilities and different backgrounds. I was hired for a specific job that none of the other colleagues do or have a degree in/experience in. Neither does he. His job and his degree are very different from mine. I understand that I have to report to him, but it doesn’t stop there. Whenever he has to give me feedback, he just completely redoes what I’ve done but just to do it his way (which is not better or worse just his way). He says learn from this. I can’t and I won’t, because I’m not a mind reader. Also, he never thinks anything is good or okay. He always sends long emails to tell us everything he thinks is wrong with what we do and after he calls us/comes into our office to tell us verbally too.\n2. He is an insane control freak. I cannot do anything without having him proof it and there are certain things that are part of my job description that he just won’t let me do. He wants to do it himself. He’ll ask me to do the preparations but he’ll take over at some point. It’s frustrating as hell. Also, I’m bored because I have to wait for him for everything and he does half of my work himself so I have nothing to do but wait. I talked to my colleague yesterday and I said something along the lines of “okay I’ll do that” and she looked scared and said “no wait for him because he wants everything done like he wants it”.\n\nMy mom said I should send him an email. I don’t want to. She says maybe I should report him somewhere but I’m not comfortable doing that either. Do I even address this? I’ve been looking for a new job but I have to stay here until august. Do I wait it out? I have horrible anxiety when I start thinking about talking to him about it. Like I get physically sick, that’s how much I hate confrontation. I don’t know what to do.",

I give and I’m willing to help out, only for that to be shit on. Like I don’t matter.\n\nIt’s been made more apparent to me within the last couple of months with several experiences. But lately, what’s hurt the most is within the last couple days being ghosted by an online friend who I thought we were really getting along well.  We’d only been talking for a month ish. I truly think it was something to do with me, though others have told me it’s not, it’s a “them” problem. This also hurts me because of all the things she told me - basically telling me how awesome I am, how I inspire her and how sweet I am.  Then giving me their number, then silence. Was all that a lie?  I got blocked on telegram and Reddit. I was never overbearing or clingy. I gave plenty of space. I checked in after a couple weeks, after saying she was out somewhere and would get to my last message later. Being rejected like this has only made my abandonment issues worse… thanks, childhood. \n\nI’ve had other traumatic experiences with being ghosted by so-called friends. Online and in person. One episode was so bad it sent me into a deep dark depression for years in 2015.  When this happened I built walls around my heart so high that I let very few people in. But, I got overconfident and reached out first with this female friend, and I got burned. \n\nI also work from home, so right there that severely limits my ability to make friends. I do belong to a gym but I honestly like to be left alone. Even though secretly I’d love a gym buddy, but … I’m afraid of it. I don’t have other hobbies. Not sure I want to try apps for meeting people because I can’t trust anyone on there. I can’t know if they’re a real person or I’m just being catfished by a dude, if they’re posing as a female…\n\nI really don’t know what my point is of making this post or if any of this makes sense. I’ve recently decided that I just am so exhausted and jaded about making friends as an adult. And I think at this point it’s too late. I feel like if I let anyone else in, they’ll find out something they don’t like (maybe what happened with this person) and they’ll leave me too.  Why should I keep trying? I feel like I’m done. I can’t do it anymore.  \n\nUnfortunately the other day I was in such mental distress that I thought I’d be better off not existing. Then I wouldn’t be a bother or burden to anyone anymore. No one would be bothered by my trying to help anyone, or be their friend ever again. \n\nThis scares me because, ever since joining a gym 2 years ago my mental health had never been better. Physically, too. But this week has been the worst I’ve felt in a long time.\n\nSo what do I do when I’m so disillusioned, exhausted and scared of putting myself out there? \n\nIf anyone could help me out, I’d greatly appreciate it.",

More open and casual.\n\nI don't know why but I have just stopped going near people. I just don't want to start conversations with certain types of people. And those certain types cover like 95% of the people around me. For some reason I talk fast and stammer. When I open my mouth in a group, the stupidest stuff comes out. \n\nI want to scream and tell everyone that I AM STILL THE SAME !!!!! \nI have jokes to crack. I am still sarcastic.

My image in the class is that of a \"Serious faced, Sad, lonely, Stupid, boring, unfunny, Nerd\". And I am not exaggerating this. I am very well aware of what people around me think and talk bout me.\n\nThere's a girl in my class who I had a crush. Initially she would come and spend time with me willingly.

I feared uttering most stuff. Again, I was not flirtatious or funny or anything. Just boring. And if you couldn't guess it, as of today, after about 2 semesters, she does give me attention but it's not the same. I can clearly see her intrested (kinda obsessed) with a fellow classmate of mine. I feel really really bad for myself.\n\nWhat have I done to myself ? I want the old me back. I don't want to be boring to people.\nI am done watching every single \"Psychology behind being interesting socially\" videos on YouTube.\n\nSOMEONE HELP ME :(",

Anyways a woman I know approached me because she saw me standing all alone  when almost everyone around my age were in groups.She started talking to me and I couldn't make eye contact with her.She then offered to introduce to some kids she's knows from my country and at this point that's when I started tearing up.She lead me to them and introduced them to me.They were both  seemed friendly and nice but I was still too nervous and on then verge of tears which they obviously noticed.I managed to talk them normally and keep my voice from cracking.I pretty sure they now think I'm weird and so does the woman who introduced me to them. I feel so embarrassed right now and I don't think I'll ever be able to see any of them again without feel absolutely mortified.How do I stop feeling embarrassed and how can I stop feeling like crying when overwhelmed in social situations?",

The two friends that I did make suddenly ghosted me and got me fired (I didn't do anything awful, they just repeated things I'd said to the boss out of spite) and when I asked them why they literally said word for word \"You did something that made us mad but we don't want to tell you.\" I genuinely, in good faith, want to know how I'm so off-putting. \n\nIt would be extremely helpful if someone were to basically chat with me for a few weeks and be *extremely* blunt about anything socially wrong that I'm doing. I am autistic. If you hint things or just pull back and think I'll take the hint, I won't. I need someone to be extremely frank and say \"you're negative and it makes me not want to talk to you\" or \"your jokes aren't as funny as you think they are.\" Idk, whatever it is that I'm doing. \n\nI know I'm asking for a time commitment from strangers, but I can give mushroom facts in return.",

I try to moderate myself based on the circumstances others reactions,  but it's still something I'm working on, and sometimes I get stuck.\n\nFor example,  my dad (who you'd think I'd know how to communicate with by now) asked if he could bring dinner by my house,  and he asked if there are any Mexican places near me that I like.  My honest answer is no, I don't like any of the restaurants near me-- I live in a quiet suburb that caters mostly to white soccer moms trying to feed picky children, so most of the food is bland and overpriced. But if he's offering to do something nice like buy dinner for us, should I try to be more positive so I don't sour the evening? I don't think I can honestly say that I *like* any of the restaurants near me, but is there a more neutral response I can give so I don't sound unappreciative of the gesture, but I'm not lying either?",

I really loved and cared about her, but we both had our fair share of problems, so our friendship ended up quite toxic and codependent at its worst.\nWhen we graduated we started to drift away from one another until I got a boyfriend and she moved away from my state. In the end we had an argument, then it was radio silent for a couple of years.\n\nDuring those years I went to therapy and addressed a lot of my baggage. I came out a completely different person and I started to grieve my lost friendship with E, feeling a bit lonely and blaming myself for being a stupid angry teenager at the time. So I contacted her, saying I was sorry about the way things went and that I would like to patch things up if she wanted to. \n\nWe are now both 24 and have mended our relationship, but since I don't have many friends I wonder if this is how things should be or if our friendship is still a bit unhealthy.\n\nThere will be months where we don't talk at all, but then E will contact me out of the blue to complain about everything that's going on in her life. I'm happy to help her, but it's quite exhausting to be on the phone for an hour at a time listening to all her complaints and giving her reassuring words over and over. After she's done she will ask me how I am, but I'm usually a bit put off and tired so I'll just brush over some stuff that has been happening to me, and then she'll talk about what movie or tv show she's watching. \nI've tried to reach out to her in between these calls, but she often doesn't respond or even visualize my messages, and if I send audio messages asking her how she is or talking about some funny stuff I've seen, she just won't listen to them and act like I've never sent them in the first place. I don't think E does this on purpose, I bet she just forgets to answer, but it's a bit odd to me because I always do my best to not leave people hanging. \n\nE also says that she's happy to be my friend and that I'm one of the few people she can open up to. This makes me feel so bad because I'm actually a bit resentful towards her since I feel like she only reaches out when she needs a shoulder to cry on, but maybe adult friendships are supposed to be like this and I'm seeing things the wrong way",

I would hang out with him on occasion to talk about random stuff. He worked long hours in a toxic work environment and wasn't happy in his relationship. So I gave him some distance and just dropped by every couple months. I'd see him around sometimes so it wasn't like we weren't in contact in between visits. He never actually went out of his way to visit me at my place so I just figured he was doing his own thing. Turns out he moved a month ago and I only just found out. He didn't even say good bye to me.\n\nThe second was very close. He was like family. We shared a hobby and it was deeply enriching. I learned quite a bit and despite being a lot of physical work and gas to drive out there I never regretted the time spent. The last couple times I saw him he and his wife were stressed about things I made a point not to ask about. I suspect money was a factor, and with his hobby I am directly associated with that expense. He aburptly cut me off completely without warning or even an argument. And it really hurt when I realized it was over.\n\nIt seems I need to find middle ground in my relationships. Either I'm all in and fully invested, or I'm distant to a point of reclusive. My question is how do I create a reasonable distance while remaining close enough to still actually be friends? The first guy didn't even know I thought of him as a friend.",

        "text": "What I mean by understanding the opposing view is that, from what I've seen, girls on the other side of this have said it's easier to make male friends because they're more open-minded, and less judgey and curt. Somehow I understand exactly what they mean, but also don't because I don't typically have those interactions.\n\nBut then for me, I find it easier to make female friends because they can talk about things in a deeper way, and they usually accept/process emotions well. From my experience, I don't relate to a lot of typical male activities either, such as reading or nature and such. In these environments, I find I am either the only or one of the only males in the room out of two dozen students. This happened just a few weeks ago in fact.\n\nOn the contrary, when I'm in a room with mostly guys, or talking to them directly, I never seem to click. Literally one time I misunderstood something by accident, and this random dude corrected me in a somewhat nasty way, and ever since then he looks at me with a suspicious/distasteful look. This isn't even the only time this has happened, it's like, whenever I try to be firm with views/opinions (BARELY - even making a *mistake* in an opinion **we both agree with** \\- I'm suddenly not respected anymore!). With girls, it is the opposite of this and it's so goddamn refreshing!!! But I don't like how I'm essentially restricted to interacting with one gender. It just feels wrong.\n\nI know this probably doesn't have much to do with anything, but I'm straight too. Which makes all of this a bit more confusing to me.\n\nIs it only because of having a specific personality type or upbringing, and somehow the boys/girls looking for specific personality traits somehow find each other, or is it something more?",

We were both in relationships at the time and both relationships were on their last legs. Hers ended first, and mine, an open relationship at the time ended messily a month later due to jealousy about her. \n\nThe truth is that I’ve been quite in love with her since we started spending time together early on. After she got into a relationship I also tried to move on but seeing her again reignited all those feelings that I had. Especially since we started spending so much time together and doing things like cooking together and hanging out platonically late at night during the summer. \n\nAbout a month after my relationship ended, I asked to hold her hand while watching a movie and she rejected me. She later texted me that if I couldn’t be okay with her not having romantic interest in me then we couldn’t hang out anymore. \n\nI obviously said that it was totally fine, which it is. But I’m still in love with her and it hurts that she doesn’t feel the same way. I don’t want to stop being her friend as it feels like punishing her for not having a romantic interest in me. \n\nI guess I’m asking how do I get over this as simple time doesn’t seem to have helped.",

        "text": "Long read ahead but it's the only way I can get anyone to understand what I'm going through. \n\nSo, in my family, NO ONE can have a serious conversation about anything. However, I am able to, which is frustrating as hell!\n\nWhenever I bring up something that normal people would consider a serious conversation, the people in my family will either stonewall me, make jokes or get angry at me and turn things around like I am belittling them or something. And obviously the conversation goes nowhere.\n\nHere's a recent and relevant example:\nWe have a miniature horse named Wully Bully who is prone to stomach aches/getting colicky when they either have too many treats or eats some hay that has too much alfalfa in it. Which if you know horses, these ailments can be serious and deadly. Their stomachs can rupture and/or when they try to roll on the ground like they do when they're stomachs are not feeling well, they can twist their stomachs. And with money being tight these days, both of those outcomes would end up with us putting him down. My mom feeds him in the morning, I feed him at night and My step dad will get off of work inbetween those 2 times and go over to the farm and feed him snacks like apples sometimes. \n\nWell, 1 night ago I noticed he wasn't his usual self when I come out to feed him his normal hay and a handful of sweet feed. He usually Screams and snorts and comes rushing towards me. That night he didn't. So I knew that meant he probably had a belly ache. So I put his halter on and gave him some banamine which is medicine for horses with upset stomachs. I ran him around a little bit to try and work out the gas in his stomach/intestines. \n\nI go over to my mom and step dad's house to tell them that he's not feeling well and that even if he seems like he's feeling better the next day, we probably should stop feeding him any sweet feed or any treats like a piece of apple or anything like that for at least a couple days. My mom stonewalled me by looking down at her phone and scrolling the very minute she heard me mention any suggestions on what we should do with him. Then My step dad just smirked and started making idiotic jokes that only he thought were funny like \"well maybe it's not the sweet feed or treats. Maybe he ate a cat.\" like seriously STUPID jokes. I say \"no, I'm serious here. There's 3 things that could be making his belly upset. 1. Treats/sweet feed 2. The hay and 3. The least likely, the weather. So I think it's best we play it safe and eliminate the treats, which is for certain not to kill him if we do. Switch out the current hay bail with a more \"strawy\" bail and see if that helps. My mom is still scrolling on her phone not replying and my step dad is still making stupid jokes as if to imply that I have no clue what I'm talking about and my suggestions are idiotic. Finally I say \"I'm serious. Can we try that?\". Step-dad doesn't say anything and I have to nudge my mom to get a response. To which she replies angrily and sarcastically \"fine! We will try that!\"\n\nSo, today I come over around 2pm and ask my mom \"was he feeling better this morning?\" she replied \"yes\". Then I ask did you give him any sweet feed? And she replied \"yes\". I kept my frustration to myself and told myself \"don't say anything. I guess if he's feeling better, he'll be OK.\" then my step dad gets off of work and goes to the farm. When he gets back to my mom's house I ask him \"how was wully?\" he says \"fine.\" I asked him \"since I'm going to feed him in a bit, I need to know if you fed him any treats?\". He said \"yea. I fed him a half of an apple.\" once again, my frustration bubbled up inside but kept it to myself because maybe he'll be just fine.\n\nSo I go to feed him tonight and what do I see? He's laying on the ground in the mud and snow and won't move. For one, he rarely ever lays down and two if he does, it will be in his hay bed I make him under the roof near the barn. I also felt his belly and it felt like cement (not good!). So I call my mom and said \"he's not feeling good again. He's laying on the ground and won't move.\" she cruises over and the first thing I say \"can we have a serious conversation without you getting mad and no one making a joke about what I have to say?\" followed by \"I told you guys we shouldn't feed him Any treats for a few days until we know for sure he's feeling better. Why do you two just ignore my suggestions like they're dumb?\" she instantly gets pissed off and tries making excuses like she knows for sure it's not the sweet feed or the apple. And when I ask \"how do you know that?\" she gets even more upset.\n\nSo I stop her once more and say \"see, you're getting mad for no reason. Like I'm saying or doing something purposely to piss you off. And I'm not.\" followed by \"given that what wully is going through could possibly kill him. Is not a reasonable suggestion to cut out treats and sweet feed until he's feeling better for a few days?\" then I said  \"if we don't know what it is exactly causing it, let's play process of elimination and cut out the sweet feed and treats, if he's still sick after that then it might be the hay which we will have to go and by a bail that we know doesn't have a lot of greens in it. If hes still sick after that then we know it's something else like the weather or possibly eating some plant he found or something. And regardless, if he has a belly ache, apples and sweet feed can't do anything but make it worse. So why do it???\"\n\nShe just looked at me like I was crazy and said angrily\" fine! We will try that!\" and I asked\" why are you saying that like youre mad at me?? I don't understand.\" to which she got her car and said \"i'm leaving. Bye\" and drove off.\n\nSo I gave him more banamine tonight and now I'm staying over here to run him around every once in awhile to hopefully work out the bloat/gas out of him.\n\nThat's just one example of how serious conversations go in my family. And it's so frustrating. And honestly makes no sense to me. My suggestions i made about the horse would do nothing to hurt him. If anything, my suggestions would help him feel better and at the worst it would do nothing and we'd be at square one.\n\nI can only conclude that instead of them thinking about the horses health, they're more concerned with someone younger than them suggesting what they should do. And if what I say works that I'll lord it over them or something and use it in future situations with other things. That's all I can think of. Because the ONLY other reason would be they want the horse to die which I know that isn't it at all. Like, not at all. So it has to be my first conclusion.\n\nSorry for the long read. But I'm super frustrated right now. And this is just 1 example of MANY and the most recent. And never being able to have serious conversations with them without them either getting angry or shrugging off what I'm Saying with idiotic \"jokes\" it's extremely depressing and frustrating.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions or articles or studies about this type of behavior, I'm all ears. Thank you.",

        "text": "\\*\\*TW: self-harm\\*\\*\n\nI am struggling with what I can/should do to help my friend who has social anxiety and depression. I have invited him out to social events with my other friends with mixed results. I think he’s given up meeting friends on his own, and other than me and one other person he doesn’t really socialize, he just sits in his room and plays games and watches youtube all day. He also lives far away from both of us, which doesn't help. I've given him suggestions for ways to meet other people. He’s also been focusing on his health lately and I try to give him positive reinforcement, and I don’t criticize him if he slips up. He was severely depressed before I met him and considered suicide, but when I met him he was recovering and doing better. I want to find the balance between not trying to “fix” him, but also being a supportive friend and helping him get out of his comfort zone. \n\nBut I’m trying to figure out what the appropriate level of help I should give to him is. I don’t want to force him into a stressful situation or make it seem like I’m trying to change him to fit my image of what he should be, but he also tells me A LOT about how he’s frustrated with not being able to talk to people and make connections. And I’ll give him advice but he basically ignores everything I say and gives excuses. Whenever I meet with him we usually talk about our shared hobby interests, and he’ll share his emotional baggage, but he also has a hard time meeting me halfway and doesn’t really seem concerned with my own problems when I share things with him. \n\nIt feels like I’m his only outlet, so there isn’t a give and take that you’d normally expect in a friendship, more like I’m his therapist. This can be really frustrating for me, but I’m also not trying to quit being friends with him because I do genuinely like him and enjoy spending time with him. But I don't want, nor am I qualified, to be anyone's therapist. I’m not sure what to do. I just get frustrated hearing about the same problems every time we hang out. It’s a huge emotional drain for me if we spend a long time hanging out together. \n\nI’ve also gone through depression and I know I should look out for myself first, and not take on all of his emotional baggage on my shoulders too. I need some advice on what is the appropriate amount of help to give to him, because I’m kind of lost right now.",

        "text": "I (25,f) used to be outgoing in high school and early college. I was popular. a people pleaser who conformed to who I was around. Kind of ignorant in ways but people liked me and I was funny.. As I have gotten older I have grown into myself. I became more introverted as I learned what my real interests and passions are. For a while in my early 20s/late college, I was really confident in myself and thriving. More Introverted with a small but good friend circle, and was unapologetically myself. I loved trying to attract like minded people rather than getting everyone to like me. I always dated around and never had a long lasting relationship which was fun but of course I outgrew this.\n\nNow, and it seems like since covid really, (or since graduating college in 2020) my social skills have been on a steady decline. I think my self confidence was rocked when I moved to another state to live out my dreams and it failed, so I had to move back home. In addition I haven’t worked in an actual social setting around other people since covid. I only see the same good friends about once a month or less which i’m fine with. I am also in a long lasting comfortable relationship now and around immediate family almost daily. However I really haven’t been outside my bubble to exercise my conversational skills in a long time. \n\nNow I have extreme social anxiety. \nI have become sooo awkward. I think it’s clear to other people that I appear shy and anxious when talking to them, even though I try to hide it, which makes them feel awkward too. I say weird things that i’m always beating myself up for afterwards and I don’t know how to smoothly carry a conversation. I’m especially awkward bumping into acquaintances, when I know i’m leaving a lasting impression on them. which happens a lot now that i’m living back at home.\n\nThis really sucks and I don’t know how to fix it.",

        "text": "So I reconnected with an old friend from many years ago in instagram and we had a good relationship. But in the past few days, I saw that their following page (it's where you see what or whom they're following) has dwindled down from 42 to 0 following. I first thought that maybe it's just people either leaving the platform or accounts suspended, but I rechecked those accounts and they're still online. I kinda fear that it may be a sign of them planning to leave. This wasn't the first time that they did this, as in mid 2014 they ghosted out o tumblr for 2 years until late 2016 that she's gonna leave (at least on tumblr). The last post they made was 2 months ago and they last spoke to me late Jan. I tried talking to her how she's doing, but nothing. Granted, she could just be just cleaning out her homepage and just unfollowing certain users and refollow the ones she likes, but still, this kinda alarms me as I haven't spoken to her for 8 years until I met her again on instagram. I don't know what I should do. I don't want to annoy her, but at the same time I still wanna friends with the person. She was also the reason why I got back into drawing after bad years of middle school on not having any classes thanks to my state's test, so I still give her a lot of gratitude for helping me back after seeing her artwork.",
