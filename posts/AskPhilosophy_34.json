        "text": "“One of the deepest and most lasting legacies of Descartes’ philosophy is his thesis that mind and body are really distinct—a thesis now called “mind-body dualism.” He reaches this conclusion by arguing that the nature of the mind (that is, a thinking, non-extended thing) is completely different from that of the body (that is, an extended, non-thinking thing), and therefore it is possible for one to exist without the other. This argument gives rise to the famous problem of mind-body causal interaction still debated today: how can the mind cause some of our bodily limbs to move (for example, raising one’s hand to ask a question), and how can the body’s sense organs cause sensations in the mind when their natures are completely different? This article examines these issues as well as Descartes’ own response to this problem through his brief remarks on how the mind is united with the body to form a human being. This will show how these issues arise because of a misconception about Descartes’ theory of mind-body union, and how the correct conception of their union avoids this version of the problem. The article begins with an examination of the term “real distinction” and of Descartes’ probable motivations for maintaining his dualist thesis.”",

        "text": "Consider the following scenario:\n\n&gt; M lives in the US and argues that Americans have a moral obligation not to be racist. R responds to the conclusion to M's argument by saying 'Then why are you still in the US? You could move out!'.\n\nNow, it is likely not the case that M's argument implies that M should necessarily follow R's advice. But it seems that R is trying to appeal to some hypocrisy in order to conclude M's argument is absurd.\n\nAppeals to hypocrisy (aka _tu quoque_) are typically fallacious, but I think this retort is a special type of appeal to hypocrisy since it is likely the case that there is in fact no relevant hypocrisy present. Instead, it seems that R is making an _egoist assumption_: that M only cares about their own well-being. But M's arguments would likely indicate that this assumption is false.\n\nFurther, M is likely practically trying to help solve the problems in the world that are related to their argument. This includes trying to make the US less racist through speeches, marches, debates, protests, demonstrations, policy change, conversation, etc. Moving out of the US does not help in solving the problems that the US claims to have.\n\n**Question**: Is this an informal fallacy, and if so is there a name or any literature for it?\n\nI have primarily noticed this fallacy deployed in the following applied ethics topics:\n\n### 1. Abortion\n\nL argues that it immoral to create a human and then later kill the human when there was no harm in not creating the human in the first place. C replies:\n\n&gt; _\"Then why haven't you adopted anyone?\"_\n\nClearly L is arguing that abortion is bad for the human who will be killed as a result, but C seems to miss this since L's adoption is not addressing the humans in the future who will be killed by abortion.\n\n### 2. Antinatalism\n\nA argues that it is always a personal harm but never a personal benefit to have been created and that the harms are really severe in order for it to be a moral obligation to not procreate. N replies:\n\n&gt; _\"Then why are you still living? You could kill yourself.\"_\n\nThis doesn't solve the problem A seeks to address. The issue is that the actions of others causes others harm. N assumes that A only cares about the well-being of A when this is likely not true. A could spend time advocating for policy change, political pressure, having conversations/debates, etc. to bring awareness to what they see as an issue.\n\n#### Notes\n\nThere might be other reasons that these replies are fallacious, but I am curious if there is any literature surrounding the reasons I discussed. Other examples of similar counterarguments are the \"that's your personal choice; respect my personal choice\" claims made surrounding the topics of veganism, religion, abortion, antinatalism, and many more.",

It almost seems like another perversion of Darwinism -&gt; social Darwinism. \n\nI would love to hear what others have to think about this attempt at a \"philosophy\", maybe there's something obvious that I'm missing here. To formalize the question(s):   \n\n\n* Is this a viable philosophy? \n* Is the jump from physical law to ethical/moral imperative valid?\n* Is this even in line with canonical accelerationist texts? \\[Marx, Bataille, Deleuze and Guattari, Fanged Noumena (leave out the rest of Nick Land)\\]",

If that is the case, maybe they will start to develop a technology in the simulated world, which is again able to simulate a world, thus going further and further down the recursion. \n\nThis has been bothering me since some time, because it is thinkable that our universe is nothing more but some kind of simulation created by a \"higher\" world, which again, is simulated by an even higher world.

Both are a recording surface, which inscribe and allow for the production of intensities, both can have their intensities “pass through signs” and be stratified as a result (or for Lyotard “exploited”), both are surfaces of reality, etc. There are notable differences though, especially in description. The BwO is described as an “intensive spatium,” the Dogon egg, or a kind-of black tarry surface whereas the libidinal band is described more like a Möbius strip, which cools and heats up. \n\nAnyway, having not read Lyotard, I was wondering if anyone can elucidate on some of the similarities and differences between these concepts. Moreover, have Deleuze and Lyotard ever commented on each others’ philosophical projects? I know Lyotard eventually abandoned _Libidinal Economy_, but the concepts are so strikingly similar, both leveling and dealing a great blow to Lacanian psychoanalysis in France at the time that it just seems too eerily similar.",

We have some fundamental dimensional constants which \"interact\" with each other.\n\nTo quote \\[Carl Bender\\]\\[2\\] about another constant in physics:\n\n\"About often we treat H bar and this being small but you and I know that H bar is not small that's equal to what okay because it depend if R is as a number that contains units so depending on what system of units you choose H bar may be gigantic or it may be small you can't  say that H bar is a small number or a big number in MKS units yeah it's 10 to the minus 34 but that's not a small number because it contains dimensions which make that number either big or small okay but it's often very very powerful to think of H bar at being a small number and we have to make that precise which we will and when you do that is where wkb theory comes from that's where that's where does it baby if you put if you treat other numbers in\n\nWhat does the physicist do to give life to something like information?

        "title": "Alex Epstein Fossil Fuels - Does anyone have a better framework than expanding human flourishing?",
        "author": "BananaBeach007",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/zz6ief/alex_epstein_fossil_fuels_does_anyone_have_a/",
        "text": "I've read both of Alex Epstein's books on fossil fuels, Personally I find his case on the benefits of fossil fuels to be compelling. Mostly the fact that when the benefits and positive/ negative externalities are weighed fossil fuels have a number of significant advantages over other forms of technology. I picked up his book with the belief that Nuclear has the solution to many of the worlds energy woes, I still believe that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyhow I agree with most of his points but mostly take issue with his framework of improving human flourishing. I am not against human flourishing but it presents a strange utilitarian argument where the welfare of humans is the only concern. I want to talk about my concerns with this method of reasoning and I hope you folks can either point out the errors in my way, or help develop a more robust framework that one can use for energy liberation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst the utilitarianism argument is the default position people seem to take on how large issues should be tackled. It may sound good in practice but is incredibly fickle when you dive into it. There are plenty of thought experiments that demonstrate this - a notable one being as a doctor you run an organ transplant clinic and you need 10 different organs that will save the lives of 10 patients, and you have a resident who has also the healthy organs that have been tissue typed for the patients by sacrificing this one healthy resident you can save the lives of 10 sick patients - do you do it? Most people tend to be uncomfortable with this line of reasoning. \n\nIn the United States this reasoning was considered dangerous and argued against in Federalist 10 by James Madison arguing about factions and the protections of having either powerful minorities suppress majorities, or majorities steamroll minorities due to majority rule. \n\nSecond issue is diversity, people have unique viewpoints, wants, and desires and this is difficult to quantify. It is the libertarian reason that the individual is the biggest minority. So this being said it is virtually impossible to decide that there is a primary value/options that people want out of a menu of values/ options. When this deals with multiple variables it is virtually impossible to maximize on this front. Luke smith explains this well:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"So the first problem is one any mathematician will realize right off the bat: it's rarely possible to maximize a function for two variables. If we had the means, we could maximize (1) the amount of good in society or (2) the number of people who feel that good, but nearly certainly not both (if we can it's a bizarre coincidence). It's sort of like saying you want to find a house with the highest available altitude and the lowest available price; the highest house might not have the lowest price and vice versa, the same way the way of running society which maximizes happiness is nearly certainly not be the way which maximizes all individuals' happiness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are some classic moral puzzles that bring this out: Let's say there's a city where basically everyone is in absolute ecstasy, but their ecstasy can only take place if one particular person in the city is in intense and indescribable pain. Or to put it another way, to maximize my happiness, we might need to make everyone in the world my slave and allow me to rule as I please. Although this might maximize my happiness, it might not maximize anyone else's (if it does however, we might want to consider it).\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlex Epstein believes in the approach of letting private property owners dictate what happens on their land. That this ample protection of private property will in fact lead to massive development that will lead to human flourishing and uses the fact that the empire state building was built in a little more than a year, a 135 mile pipeline was built in 3 months. The issue I have with this approach again is maximizing for values and the differences people want in regard to land usage/ resource extraction\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-With libertarian ideology public land should be controlled by private entities - BLM, NPS, Forest Service, and private entities do a better job at management - preservation, balancing resource extraction, balancing the needs of the public and industry while also preventing negligence on behalf of the government (bad wildfire management practices).  An example of this is the Nature Conservancy who have lands in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Tennessee, and California including a number of other states. In my opinion the Nature Conservancy does a great job but it is rare to find private companies who do this I know thousands of acres of forest in Nova Scotia, The Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and the Pacific Northwest which are inaccessible to the public and cordoned off as they are controlled by logging companies who use the land exclusively for timber. Texas is often championed as a model where the vast majority of land is private and resources are exploited well. The trouble with Texas is if you value the outdoors public lands provide vast opportunities to recreation which are almost non-existent in Texas. This is why so much of the American West, and Canadian West are considered desirable places to live is due to the outdoor recreation opportunities. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \\-The issue with fossil fuel/ mineral exploitation is it is often a zero-sum game. I've lived in Appalachia and in the Western United States where I worked in the mining industry. There are plenty of examples of outstanding mining practices, but there are also horrific examples that occurred with older frameworks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Appalachia you have Little Blue Run Lake a toxic lake of coal slurry, that constantly pollutes water supplies. Appalachia built much of the US. During WWII the men got exemptions from the draft because coal was such a valuable natural resource as it powered the steel mills and led the US to becoming an industrial power to be successful in the war. The industry coal powered went to areas more appropriate to manufacturing - great lakes region which had access to great lakes/ river transport, the sunbelt region. But there was a massive asymmetry in development. Big towns in this region such as Harlan were company towns and when the company left they destroyed much of the infrastructure, hotels, employee housing. The region lags behind the US for a number of reasons but a major one is much of the profits generated from the mining don't go to the people or region (they most get wage/ infrastructure improvements) -product is exported and most of the profit is centralized in areas where the mining headquarters are - Atlanta, GA, Charlotte, NC. This isn't an isolated instance - you can look at the Berkeley Pit in Montana One of the world's largest superfund sites - these are difficult to clean up and liability to clean them is difficult due to the LLCs the companies employ. Jared Diamond calls this rape and run. Anyhow resource development is asymmetrical - if it is uranium mining in the Wind Rivers, or Navajo nation, or oil refineries in Cancer alley. This is only some of what exists in North America the bulk of this is in the developing world. He seems to address it by advocating for local standards of pollution, but again the issue is this is dictated by mining companies as opposed to the people who live in the area (people want mining jobs -not environmental degradation that comes with it). There has to be a way to address this so more nature is protected, while taking into account diverse viewpoints - Greatest human flourishing = mountain top removal in these areas as the worlds' population outweighs that of Appalachia. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEpstein doesn't address how these problems would be dealt with, if anything they'd be made worse. The closest thing I can find in his work is something akin to Neil Postman's technological fallacy. That these problems will occur, but with the boom in human technology these problems will be addressed. I.e. small modular reactors will be cheap to install on reservations, in Appalachia, and at Superfund sites to clean up the messes of the past and what will be made in the present. Similar to Neil Postman/ Ted Kaczynski - New technology isn't weighed/ evaluated for negative externalities it is just released on the public, and new technology is supposed to make up for the shortcomings/ shortfalls of prior technology but ends up creating problems of it's own. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nlastly human primacy utilitarianism under the framework that Epstein advocates It would be permissible to destroy a resource If it leads to greater human flourishing at large. I've gone on way too long with everything else but I'll keep this short and just use animals as an example. The extinction of species is permissible if it leads to greater human flourishing. He talks about the permissibility of animal testing because of the benefits it offers humans. That may be fine but a major issue I have is a Talebian one - we as humans are terrible at evaluating complexity with wild species there are a number of ecological services provided by plants/ animals that we don't yet understand/ can't quantify. There isn't a framework he puts forward for this but I assume it would be in the realm of the proliferation of cheap/ abundant energy will deal with this later. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are plenty of examples of exploitation in the name of Human flourishing leading to extinctions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Extinction of passenger pigeon in the name of food/ nuisance control\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Extinction of Tasmanian wolf -nuisance control\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Functional extinction of Baiji (Chinese Freshwater Dolphin) Due to development of Three Gorges Dam. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Near extinction of Bison - first overhunting of first nations, and later settlers using bison for pelts, meat, and fertilizer. \n\n1830s Estimated 30-60 million bison in North America - mass hunting begins\n\n1870 - 2 million killed in one year southern plains alone\n\n1884 - 325 wild bison left\n\n1910 - conservation brings number to 1,000\n\n2017 - over 500,000 bison in North America. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyhow it is a difficult question to weigh as what is more important saving a dolphin species or providing clean electricity to hundreds of millions of people? Fishing for large numbers of shrimp or protecting the vaquita? \n\nIt's more than I was planning to write but wanted to get your folks take?",

If he only wishes to provide descriptive ethics and not normative ethics, perhaps he is exempt from addressing the is/ought distinction, as he's not using any \"ought\"s.\n\nWhat do you think? Is this a possible solution? Is there another? Are there any illuminative passages from the Treatise (or elsewhere) that I missed?",

        "author": "ImmortalScrunchie",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/zyh6py/question_about_art_specifically_film_and/",
        "text": "I know there have been questions similar to this asked on this subreddit before, and while those answers will undoubtedly help me, I also have a more personal question.\n\nWhen I sometimes talk to film people about objectivity in film the answer I most often get is that while much of it is subjective we can still analyze the objective elements of it (acting, lighting, etc.) and also analyze what we like and do not like about it. While I, for the most part, agree with this, I do not see how this is objective *per se*. \n\nFirst I would like to address the idea of evaluating the objective elements of a film. This seems like evaluating the objective elements of an action, such as, 'does this action cause pain?' While this may be a useful question to ask *within* the institution of a morality that cares about that, this is, I think, completely useless to the error theorist when talking about meta-ethics. To say, 'the lighting is good when you can see things,' or, 'it is good when it accomplishes what it wants to'... is not objective. The first point is already an assumption. Why is that good? That is like saying, 'an action is good if you can universalize it.' That statement seems to have *no place* in a meta-ethical discussion, no? The second part is also subjective as different people will have different ideas of what accomplishes it best. No, people having different ideas doesn't make it subjective, but how could you possibly argue that it is objective? If the lighting *doesn't* make me feel *that* way... how could I be wrong? How is that like saying the world is flat? It is true that that is how I feel, so it is true that, to me, this lighting setup *did not* accomplish what it set out to do, for me, maybe it did for someone else. This is not like different people having different opinions on the shape of the earth.\n\nTo address the second part. I do believe it is useful to critique movies and discuss what we liked and did not like about them. But I also believe this can only go so far (and again, I do not see how this is objective either). Often times we can respect the objective aspects of a film and see why we would like it... but we still don't like it. I love Stalker, but not Mirror. Both by Tarkovsky, both considered some of the greatest films of all time. I have no complaints or reasons to dislike the latter... but I still do not like it very much. For any element 'x'  that I could pull out and say 'I don't like this' I could find another film where I *do* like element 'x'. So it would seem it is *not because* of 'x' that I dislike this film. It must be because the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The way 'x' works in this film compared to others. This is something Tarkovsky says in Sculpting in Time. If you take a moment in life that had a great impact on you and film it exactly as it happened, it may not have that same effect because it doesn't account for 'the poeticism of life'. Film oftentimes gives me this indescribable 'feeling', and for the most part I never hear critics who talk about why they like a film talk about this feeling. I do, however, hear artists talk about it, and it seems all who feel it agree it is beyond description (C.S. Lewis actually talks about it well in Surprised by Joy, but I disagree when he uses this as a proof for God). It seems this feeling is something much deeper than most art criticism, and when I find an artist who relates to this feeling we both find it hard to take a lot of criticism seriously when it claims to say that they know why they enjoy or dislike a piece of art. It just seems so *shallow* compared to this deep feeling.\n\nI am aware of some objections to moral error theory that would seem to be applicable to art as well and I am currently reading the normative web and exploring these more, but this raises another question. Why does it matter if a piece of art is somehow objectively bad? This seems to go back to morals. Does bad art have a bad effect? I really do not see anything morally reprehensible about people who have 'terrible' taste in music and movies... in fact, as a film major I meet a lot of people with more refined taste in cinema and art and they are often much more unpleasant and jerks than those who think Christopher Nolan is the second coming of Jesus. Telling me L'Atalante is an objectively great film doesn't make me like it. I can learn from it etc. but it does nothing for me, and vice versa with 'bad' art.\n\nThank you for any and all replies!",

I am trying to understand, for atheists, where objective morality comes from.

I asked him why he did this and he said: \n\n&gt;I studied at the University of Valladolid, and lived in the Colegio Mayor Santa Cruz, which he founded. According to the constitutions of said colegio mayor, dated November 21st 1483, we the santacrucenses should refer to him as \"my lord\". I may be the only one to actually do that.\n\nThe user Stal77 called this into question by asking: \"That’s an interesting tradition, but do you not think that it impeaches your apparent objectivity on a subject if you refer to the subject as “my lord?” \n\nThe moderator DanKensington replied saying that \"'objectivity' is not a goal of history. Especially when it comes to minoritised scholars speaking of their own history...\"\n\nThe two of them then got into a more detailed debate whereby Stal77 stressed the importance of objectivity in history and that referring to a historical subject as \"my lord\" encourages bias. Also, they both agreed on the point that it is impossible to be truly objective and unbiased. However, Stal77 said that we should strive towards these goals nonetheless.\n\nDanKensignton repeatedly stated that \"objectivity is not a goal of history\" but later seemed to revise this somewhat by effectively stating that it is not ***the*** goal and that other cultures have other goals when studying history which are equally as valid. This is the point which got me interested.\n\nDanKensington states:  \n\n&gt;What you’re not grasping is that the preference for an objective evaluation is actually a cultural worldview in of itself—a Western one at that. To other cultures and scholars who utilized different theoretical models, objectivity isn’t even necessarily something to strive for despite the self-admitted futility to achieve it. Doing so can further obscure the narratives and introduce biases that the “objective” scholar does not recognize because they’re consumed with maintaining some nonexistent idea of neutrality that they, as a human, will never be able to demonstrate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think about DanKensington's view? I would like to hear some different perspectives on this because I had never really considered it before and think it's pretty interesting.",

This  seems to lead to an infinite regress or circularity\n\nIt seems to me there is a way around this, but it's not mentioned in the article. Use several different processes to determine the truth of some set of propositions, and if they all agree, then conclude that they are all reliable. The idea is that it would be extremely unlikely that they all agreed on a set of beliefs \"by chance\". \n\nIs there a name for this kind of argument? I feel like it must be talked about",

        "text": "I have been doing a focused reading group of Rene Guenon’s Reign of Quantity.  In his book he makes many controversial and seemingly unsubstantiated claims.  One such claim, “the greater cannot follow from the lesser” seems to be axiomatic, and many of his other conceptions follow from this idea.\n\nHe states “there seems to be no reason whatever why a thing should always begin by being simple and continue to get more complex: on the contrary, considering that the germ of any being must necessarily contain the virtuality of all that the being will be in the future, so that all the possibilities to be developed in the course of its existence must be included in the germ from the start”…origins must be complex etc.\n\nThe first of my, generally obtuse, objections is that some complex systems seem to show emergent complexity: Conways game of life or any of Wolframs automata, though designed, are inherently simple and despite this, and generate complexity… (plus vorticies, social behaviors, information networks… and perhaps the universe and life itself)\n\nOr, if everything contains the nature of what follows from it, then the structure of “things”, generally, cannot change.. either in number or nature. Or, if degeneration is allowed, complexity should only decrease… which I guess is reasonable if you believe in some kind of creator and some idea of entropy…\n\nAre there any good arguments around this idea?",
