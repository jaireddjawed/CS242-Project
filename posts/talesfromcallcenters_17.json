        "text": "I just got off of this call, after a grueling 2 hours of argument. I do not feel successful, nor do I feel much of anything. For background: I work general customer service for a major appliance company. I schedule service, basic troubleshooting, and answer any customer's questions about their appliances. I have a background/degree in law before this however, and that comes in incredibly important in this tale.\n\nBug shall be me. Prop shall be the customer.\n\nBug: Hi thanks for calling X my name is Bug! May I ask your name?\n\nProp: I'm Prop. And I have a question about my new washer?\n\nBug: Sure thing! What can I help with?\n\nI went through all the pleasantries of registering the appliance/getting address for service, etc at this point.\n\nProp: Um...in this little book thing, it says that this thing could have chemicals that cause cancer and affect pregnancy?!?\n\nI instantly get this feeling of dread from her shrill cry. Not one of the dreaded chemical law calls. Everybody's seen the tags, \"According to the State of California this product contains chemicals known to the state that can cause cancer/pregnancy issues.\" Well...everyone but this lady.\n\nI'll spare you the full 2 hour play by play, but it was somewhat like this:\n\nBug: Oh, yes ma'am. That's a tag that by the state of California must be attached to anything manufactured to be sold there as a warning by Proposition 65.\n\nProp: SO. I'm IN California! And I'M PREGNANT! WHY did my store not tell me that this could hurt my unborn CHILD????\n\nBug: Ma'am...that law simply states that if anything is manufactured or comes in contact with one of any eight hundred chemicals we MUST label it accordingly. \n\nProp: Well WHICH chemicals was it?!\n\nI blinked, tried to find information, was unable to give her a complete list, as a result she argued with me for a while. Said that if she miscarries she's suing X \n. She wants to return it for one that doesn't have that sticker, informed her we couldn't do that. It wasn't functionally failing.\n\nLady kept insisting, unfortunately it took her two HOURS to ask for a supervisor. Can we return it? No. What chemicals are they? Gives her website for list. gave the lady the exact website/phone number to contact the CA division of state law in charge of that who would have that list on hand.Wash, rinse, repeat.\n\nOver. And over. And over again. \n\nI finally broke. \n\nBug: I have supervisor X on the line waiting for you Ma'am, but first may I ask you a question? \n\nProp: YEAH??? WHAT!!!\n\nBug: ....if you check different things in your home do you think you would find the same warning on them?\n\nProp: I have NEVER found that warning anyWHERE!\n\nI still guarantee if she checked her pillow, tv, hell...paint on the WALLS it would say the same exact thing. Lead told her the same thing I did and argued back.\n\nI got a IM from that lead later on asking me why I always get the crazies. I replied that I was just lucky I guess.   ",

For 99% of chats we interact with the customer as a normal human being, but there are one or two clients who do not want you to speak to the customer as all. They request that a message along the lines of \"All of the customer service specialists are busy at this time, please leave an email or phone number and a member of our team will get back to you as soon as they are available.\" is sent to the customer and nothing else. It's important to note as well that if you don't follow instructions like these you will get a autofail on the chat. \n\nNot too hard to understand, right? Usually at this point people just close out of the chat. Not this lady though.\n\n&gt; Lady: I need to reschedule an appointment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: All of the customer service specialists are busy at this time, please leave an email or phone number and a member of our team will get back to you as soon as they are available.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lady: The scheduler on the website isn't working, do you know when it will be back up?\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: Script. \n&gt; \n&gt; Lady: Is this an automated message?\n&gt; \n&gt; Me thinking: I've said the same thing twice in a row so it would be safe to assume that I am a bot, yes. Insert script here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lady: You did not answer my questions. You are not very helpful. \n\nI thought she was done so I closed the chat. \n\nShe was not done.\n\nNew chat:\n\n&gt; Lady: I need to reschedule my appointment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: All of the customer service specialists are busy at this time, please leave an email or phone number and a member of our team will get back to you as soon as they are available.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lady: Can I speak to some one else?

I would prefer to speak to someone else PLEASE\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: Script. \n&gt; \n&gt; Lady: are you the only one on chat? I would prefer to speak to someone else PLEASE\n\nYes, we went back and forth literally 10 times. I'm not sure how she didn't understand at this point that I wasn't going to answer her questions. Some people are really bull headed I guess?\n\n&gt; Me: Script\n&gt; \n&gt; Lady: PLEASE STOP!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: Script.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lady: STOP!!!\n\nFinally, the out I needed. When a customer says stop we have to immediately close the chat without saying anything else. \n\nShe didn't come back.",

        "text": "So we all know how call centers are, people call and yell. A lot of yelling. Sometimes you call them, for various reasons, and there is still more yelling.\n\nIn my center most of us used to take inbound calls to assist customers, since it is now off season there are fewer of us and we make outbound calls essentially asking, \"hey we did a thing for you, where is my money?\" - not that rudely, but you get my point. These calls have the potential to come 2 times a day for a few months before we send it to collections. It's rare that we are calling people 2 times everyday for months and only happens when there are some logistical errors in upper management. \n\nToday, Old Glory called Fired Customer. Another Coworker stepped in at The end to close the call. The following is the interaction. Paraphrased cause i have the memory of an extinct walnut.\n\n*Ring*\nFC: WHAT THE FUCK DO YALL WANT?\nOG: (O_o) *no words*\nFC: Well? Are you gonna answer? I said what the fuck do y'all want??\nOG: ... *no words*\nFC: WHY THE FUCK Y'ALL ALWAYS CALLING ME? ALL THE FUCKING TIME YOU ARE ALWAYS CALLING ME! WHY THE FUCK AINT YOU ANSWERING?\nOG: *puts the call on speaker for everyone to hear.* (Although we were all pretty much listening anyways because she was very loud.)\nCall Center: *everyone stops what they are doing and listens*\nFC: ARE YOU NOT GOING TO ANSWER ME WHORE? THATS WHAT YOU ARE. A WHORE. YOU A BITCH. YOU NOT GOING TO ANSWER ME?!\n*moment of silence before she rages again*\nFC: YOU'RE A DICK EATER! THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE. A DICK EATER. YOU DON'T DO SHIT BUT EAT DICKS. YOU EAT THE DICKS OF MEN ALL DAY. YOU DICK EATER. ANSWER ME DICK EATER. YOU JUST A DICK. EATER. MOTHER FUCKING DICK EATER. \n\n*I am not a supervisor but regularly take-over, de-escalate, and resolve calls for some of my coworkers. I move to start this, but AC steps in instead.*\n\nAC: Excuse me ma'am, I am not going to take this language, because you are being rude I am going to have to disconnect the call and will call back at a later time.\nFC: GOOD HANG UP, DICK EATER!! AND DON'T CALL BACK NO FUCKING MORE!! \nAC: I will call you later, thank you, goodbye.\nOG: *hangs up the phone*\nCall Center: *wtf expressions on our faces*\n\nSome time later our supervisor pulls in OG an has a chat with her to make sure she was alright and to inform her that we are no longer working with this customer in any capacity. OG was fine, she was laughing along with us and making jokes. Everything was okay in the end, but that was definitely the spectacle of the week. \n\nPlease excuse any formatting or spelling errors because both my phone and I are dumb sometimes.",

        "text": "I've spent the better part of the last few months reading through the subreddit. Six months ago, I started my first call center job, working through a third party company and providing support for a particularly fruity brand that makes phones and tablets.\n\nI tend to like my job -- I rarely have rude customers, the metrics aren't ridiculously strict, and I get to crochet at my desk while on calls. Throughout these six months, though, the most frustrated I've ever been was talking to a woman with an iPad who couldn't plug in her headphones.\n\nAfter getting her name and callback number, our conversation went as follows:\n\n&gt;**Me:** Thank you, ma'am. How can I help you today?\n\n&gt;**Lady:** I just purchased an iPad from Walmart, and there isn't anywhere to plug in my headphones. I want to listen to music on my iPad but there is no headphone hole. \n\nInternally, I'm thinking that maybe this lady is mixing up an iPad and an iPhone, so I ask for the Serial Number for the device and look it up. It's an iPad Pro, which 100% has a headphone jack.\n\n&gt;**Me:** Okay! I'll be happy to assist you with that today. The iPad Pro does have a headphone jack, so I'll point it out for you. Does your iPad have a case on it?\n\n&gt;**Lady:** No.\n\n&gt;**Me:** Great. So I want you to hold the iPad in your hands with the home button on the bottom -- there is a power button on the top right of the iPad, and the headphone jack will be on the top left. Do you see it?\n\n&gt;**Lady:** So you want me to go into settings? I don't understand.\n\n&gt;**Me:** No, ma'am. I want you to look on the outside edges of your iPad. There is a small hole that your headphones will fit into, and it's along the top edge of your iPad. \n\nAt this point, I already want to die. I'll spare you guys the details of a **forty-five** minute call where I attempted, in every way I could think of, to show this lady where the headphone jack was.\n\nI eventually had to contact Tier 2, in near hysterics, and ask for them to take over because I couldn't get this lady to understand very simple instructions. The Tier 2 advisor I spoke to was thankfully pretty awesome about it, and took it over happily. I merged the calls, introduced my Tier 2, and went home.\n\nA couple days later, I remembered the case and was curious about the outcome. It turns out, the Tier 2 advisor I spoke to had the customer send them a picture of the iPad. In the picture, the Tier 2 circled the headphone jack in red and sent the photo back to the customer. Exactly where I had described it to be 398673298463 times.",

The wrong days!

We legally are able to retry your payment when it fails up to two additional times.\n\nLady: Well you charged me more than my payment!

You are being rude! You're yelling and that's why I am yelling!\n\nMe: My giving you an answer you disagree with doesn't constitute yelling ma'am. I haven't raised my voice with you.\n\nLady: See!

I called Amazon customer service, and the rep said that there was no way to give me a working return label, and suggested that I pay for shipping out of pocket and he would reimburse me with Amazon credit. Of course I told him that wouldn't work, so he just said I could keep the books. I didn't believe him.

I asked the rep to send me an email confirmation before I get off the line, and he wasn't playing around. Amazon just gave me something like $400 worth of textbook for free, just because a shipping label had an invalid tracking number. WTF?\n",

Since it is flu-season right now, the dialogue mentions getting a flu shot is needed, blah-blah-blah. It then says, \"Did you know that washing your hands is like a do-it-yourself vaccine?!\" \n\nI immediately start laughing.

I handle scheduling service, complaints, and directing consumers to more important divisions for special circumstances. (The fancy $8,000 PLUS brand owners, RVs, legal, out of warranty parts, etc.)\n\nThis call came in, I will be Bug, the Vile Impatient Man as VIM.\n\nBug: Hi I'm Bug with X! May I get your name please? (An account pulled up but people change numbers so much you can never be sure.)\n\nVIM: SHUT YOUR G*DD*MN LAZY WHORE MOUTH AND GET ME A SUPERVISOR NOW!\n\nIt's been a while since I've been called a whore. Especially over the phone.\n\nBug: Sir I apologize but without a name and reason I cannot get a supervisor, I'm certain I can help in some manner...\n\nVIM: NO! I don't NEED one of you dumbasses! WHERE'S MY MONEY?!?!?\n\nBug; .....please hold sir.\n\nI put that ass on hold while he was still screaming, \"WHERE'S MY MONEY?!\" over and over again like in a torture scene out of a mobster movie. So then I start to dig in the file for some sort of reimbursement. That's usually the thing that pisses people off. Our reimbursements take a good 3-7 weeks to process and be delivered via mail to the unlucky soul that wants money because their washer won't wash right or they have to wait 5 precious days for service for a dishwasher...\n\nBut oh no. What I found in this man's file was a stunning warning unlike I have ever seen. I've studied law, quickly got out because it wasn't my bag but I worked for an attorney as an assistant for a good year.\n\nOn the middle most portion of the file was a all caps warning.\n\nVIM IS MERGING INTO HARASSMENT TERRITORY. IF VIM CALLS TRANSFER HIM TO LEGAL LINE XXX-XXX-XXXX. DO NOT ENGAGE, LEAVE VIM TO US TO HANDLE FOR HIS PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIM FORM.\n\nNaturally once I cold transferred him to that line I read through the file in full. Amongst the detailed insults others had gotten: \"Arsewipe.\" \"MotherFers.\" \"Piece of sh*t.\" And plenty, plenty of others...\n\nWhat is he so upset about?\n\nA $75 property damage claim.\n\n$75. He's losing his mind and calling us over TWO HUNDRED TIMES in two short months over $75. $75 that legal has said is being worked on, that keeps asking him about forms they have sent him and he has never touched nor turned in.\n\nWow. All I could say after 5 minutes of looking was wow. \n\n",

We had a spiel to explain who we were, but a lot of parents were still suspicious. I should also mention that we usually called between 4pm and 8pm EST, and some people would get angry that we interrupted their dinner. \n\nIt was mostly the mothers of sons from New Jersey and New York who were the most combative. When they learned that a female college student was calling for their teenage son, they would usually get angry and suspicious, and some would even yell and hang up on us. We had to have pretty thick skins because of this, and after 3 years of working there nothing really fazed me anymore.\n\nOne day I was calling a student who was apparently the son of immigrant parents, because his father answered the phone with a very thick accent.\n\nFather: Hello?\n\nMe: Good evening sir, I'm a student admissions representative calling from University of X. We wanted to congratulate your son Student X on his admission, and inquire if you or he have any questions that we could assist you with. \n\nFather: Excuse me, but can I please speak to a man?\n\nMe: Pardon me, sir? I don't understand...\n\nFather: Thank you for calling, young lady, but I would like to speak to your manager. I'm sure he can give me much more information than you can. \n\nMe: I'm sorry sir, but my manager Brenda (name changed) is not available at the moment.\n\nFather: That's fine, but I'm asking to talk to the man in charge of the office.\n\nMe: Sir, I am more than capable of providing any information you may need. \n\nFather: *chuckles condescendingly* I don't believe that's true. In my experience, women are far less intelligent than men, and you are obviously not qualified to help my son learn about your engineering program. Now, let me speak to the man in charge.\n\nMe: Sir, there are only women working in this office. You can speak to me, or you can do your own research. \n\nFather: My son will not speak to a woman under any circumstances! He goes to an all boys boarding school with all male teachers, so if your school only employs women then you can shove your admission up your ass! *click*",

        "text": "Hello there!\n\n\nThis is a story that happened a while ago at a job that I don't do anymore (thank god). We were a rather small customer service division, so that everyone knew and could see each other. We provided tech support for a mobile phone service provider which sometimes meant dealing with repair issues. The company itself was a service provider so they hired lots of people and let lots of people go on a regular basis. This resulted in people not being educated that well about every topic. So it wasn't surprising if an agent couldn't help a customer.\n\n\nA guy called about something pretty stupid (I think he had his phone in the shop due to repair and had a temporary replacement phone, which was a Huawei brand phone). I heard a colleague talk with the person. A few minutes later another colleague asks around if customers can get a different replacement temporary phone. This went on for a while until my phone rang and I had a customer on the line that had called a bunch of times that day (which you could read up on in the notes). It was always the same topic. I think he didn't even try out his temp phone, he just assumed the brand was shitty due to the name.\n\n\nSo I figured that my colleagues who had an exploding customer that day had actually the same customer. This means this guy almost made a female colleague cry, another one irrationally angry and wasted a lot of time occupying our staff. It was up to me to get rid of him since he wasn't going to stop.\n\n\nAs I answered the guy immediately said \"Oh, finally, you sound really competent. I have been calling all day.\" Apparently I sound very important. He mentioned that he had to talk to \"useless girls\" all day and he's glad that I'm a guy. Since I knew this was eventually going to lead to an argument I changed the topic to his issue.\n\n\nI very politely talked to him about his issue and told him basically that he's lucky he got any temporary replacement at all. And that all the other people told him this because we can't grow magic phones and throw them at customers. It's just logistically not going to happen. He \"understood\" that but wanted me to \"bend the rules\" a bit. After a not so long while I told him that there's nothing we can do and he should please stop calling because he was preventing other customers to get help.\n\n\nOf course he didn't agree. In fact he mentioned that he \"has to pay for every call so why isn't he getting what he wants\" a few times. Of course he wanted to talk to supervisors all the time. After the call I actually went to a supervisor and bugged her (she didn't want to have to do anything related to this guy) to get his account banned from calling. This was done when something like this happened, which I knew because I had been there a while. My poor colleagues. The supervisor just had to make a quick call, of course that requires work and makes us look bad or something, so the guy still got through a few times after that. We agreed to just hang up if someone got him. \n\n\nHe spent almost the entire day calling, this was one of those times where I just couldn't understand how someone would dedicate so much time and effort to an issue that is not a big deal. That job changed my view of humanity as a whole for good.\n\n\n\nEdit: TL;DR: Prejudiced guy keeps calling all day, doesn't have an appropriate issue, doesn't stop. Supervisors don't do their jobs. Colleagues are harassed.",

Yesterday, I received a message from one of the SVP assistants that a client had left a message demanding to speak to a VP and not some “low level customer service person”.\n\nSo I did my initial due diligence and see that the customer had also called our Customer Relations team.  They too had received a similar call, and the notes in the case definitely relayed that the customer was an angry, curmudgeonly person. \n\nI steeled myself and dialed him up.\n\nMe:  Good evening Mr. Customer, I am calling you back from the office of SVP regarding your recent message.  Is now a good time to talk?\n\nMr. C:  why yes it is, babsmitty, thank you for calling.  Do you mind telling me what your position is.\n\nMe:  My job title is Executive Care Specialist, and my role reports to all of our executive staff, including SVP for whom you’ve left a message.\n\nMr. C:  I have been trying for two damned weeks to talk to someone in charge.  Are you in charge?  A regional manager or an area director or something?  I only want to speak to someone at the top!!\n\nMe:  well, you’re in luck!  I am not a regional or area manager, but my role in the organization is the highest you can elevate to from a customer contact standpoint.  I’m well connected in the organization and I know all of our area..\n\nMe. C:  that’s simply not good enough.  I demand to speak to someone at the top. How can I make that happen.\n\nMe:  I would love to share your story with any of the appropriate contacts in our organization, why don’t you tell me a little about your concerns?\n\nMr. C:  who says I have a concern!?  \n\nMe:  well, drawing from your adamant pursuit of our management team, and that you haven’t shared any details with the people with whom you’ve spoken to previously, one could assume you have a complaint.  I see here you own a *really sweet sports car that costs 6 figures*, is it operating as you expect it.\n\nMr. C (softening):  yeah, it is a really fun car.  I used to own *super sweet sedan that coats 6 figures* for years.  I’m 78 now and having kind  of a late life crisis.  I love that car.\n\nMe:  it’s my favorite in our whole line up.  I got to take one for my birthday last summer!  What can I do to get you to tell me more about what’s going on?\n\nMr. C:  here’s the thing babsmitty, I actually have a compliment and I wanted to make sure that my dealership got the recognition they deserve.  When I bought this car, I also got a second set of wheels.  When I went to have them installed locally, they were the wrong size.  Now I called and yelled at the dealership a little, and they didn’t get angry.  Instead, they sent a guy from two hours away with a loaner car to pick my car up.  They put the right wheels on the car and took back the ones that they’d originally sold me, and they threw in new winter tires for me at cost.  Then, the guy drove my car back to me - I didn’t even leave my house!\n\nMe:  I will make sure that I share this!  I so appreciate you trusting me to handle this for you.  \n\nEnd:  I am sending the dealership personnel involved a bunch of sweet swag and certificates of recognition.  I love my job.  :)\n\ntl;dr:  curmudgeonly old man demands leadership, actually has a pretty cool story and compliments to share.  \n",

        "text": "We all get plenty of callers who are angry. Their go-to demand is to speak with a supervisor and our job is to attempt to help them. If you've done this job for any period of time you've developed ways to steer the customer into a solution. This will be important later, bear with me.\n\nThis call is the opposite of that. It was going great! We were laughing and joking and having a fairly smooth interaction.  I wasn't able to give the customer exactly what they wanted but I came up with a solution that was agreeable.\n\nAt my place, if the call runs longer than 10 minutes, you're very very unlikely to get a QA on that call. They could always pull the recording if they needed to but in times of trouble, letting the call run long gives me the opportunity to say things I wouldn't normally say out of fear of a bad QA. For me, these things tend to be jokes and the purpose is to get that all important survey score up, even on difficult calls.\n\nJust as I was getting the credit card number, and 15 minutes into the call I made a joke. A small joke about Georgie Porgie and how kissing girls and making them cry wouldn't fly in today's world.\n\nThe caller lost it. She was laughing so damn hard I thought she was going to choke to death. Every time she would regain her composure she would lose it again laughing so hard that she would go into coughing fits.\n\nThis went on for a full 5 minutes. The joke wasn't that funny. \n\nNow I tell you. I have been considering doing this for a very long time but I never ran across the opportunity to actually drop the line. Certainly it had no benefit other than to tickle my own funny bone but here it was... a ripe opportunity to drop a line I've been wanting to drop for a very long time.\n\nShe was finally winding down. The coughing fits were widely spaced and she seemed to be catching her breath. In for a penny, in for a pound I thought.... I said to her... \"Ms Customer, You seem to be having trouble here. I think I'm going to need to speak with your supervisor.\"\n\nThe laughter to this comment was ever-lasting. I honestly thought I had killed this woman more than once as she clearly had stopped breathing.\n\nBest 45 minutes call EVER!",

However, it was a goodwill gesture so the rule was that if they called up to reject the 70% offer, then the offer was immediately retracted. The logic being that if they were going to try and claim 100% of the charges anyway, there was no point offering 70%.\n\nThen one day it was in the news that The High Court would be investigating the matter, and while that was going on, no banks would be offering any refunds. A woman called up and said\n\n\"Hi, you have made us an offer for these bank charges and we would like to accept that.\"\n\nI checked her information and there was a note on there from the advisor she spoke to last week. It explained that her and her husband had called up to reject our \"pathetic and insulting offer\" and that they would be taking the bank to court for all of their charges. The notes also detailed that the couple took turns to be unnecessarily abusive to the advisor.\n\nI told her about the note and said that the offer no longer stood. She argued that she did call, but only called to say she MIGHT reject the offer, but wasn't definite. The notes on her file suggested otherwise. Oh, and who the hell calls up to say they're undecided? After some arguing, her husband who was in the background snatched the phone. He didn't know that rejecting the offer meant it was retracted, as he had only heard his wife's side of the conversation.\n\n\"Right, listen here you stupid little boy. Last week we called up to say we were rejecting the offer and this week we are calling up to say we are accepting the offer. Are you too stupid to understand that.\"\n\nBasically, he just confirmed what his wife had been denying. And that's when I hear her in the background:\n\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOOO. You silly man.\"\n\nShe then grabbed the phone and tried to say her husband made a mistake and didn't know what he was talking about but I told her he had now confirmed what our notes say and the offer definitely no longer available.\n\nAs she was putting down the phone, I just heard her say \"Oh Trevor you are bloody stupid sometimes.\"",

I could take an electronic check payment which takes several days to clear and you could get cash from your daughter in law and put it in your bank account tomorrow before it clears to cover it. \n\nDB: (raging like I killed her puppy and stomped her grandchild) I cannot do that my bank is 120 miles away in town!!!! Just put that it’s in my name!!!!! \n\nMe: I’m so sorry ma’am I can’t do that it will decline on the banks end for fraud if the name doesn’t match (not necessarily true but it’s what I’m paid and trained to say and if I don’t I get written up) \n\nDB: Your apologies help nothing! How much would I have to pay tomorrow if I cancel and need to start new? (I calculate the customer is behind for November and December and would have to pay a new down payment because of how insurance works, don’t rage at me so don’t control it) \n\nMe: That would be $669.15, that’s for 2 months past due plus a new one month down payment. \n\nDB: I only have to pay $223.05 today what the hell?\n\nMe: I understand your confusion ma’am and I’m so sorry. You’re currently as of today to avoid canceling paying November of $223.05 if you stayed active we were making January a double bill of $446.10 to cover the past due December and the January payment but it you cancel for non payment and reinstate we can’t push the past due balance forward it has to be paid all at once and we need a new down payment of one month to start the policy from scratch. \n\nDB: (Literally screaming like a possessed person in an exorcism movie) You dumb fucking cunt I’ll kill you and rip out your still beating heart, my husband will rape you and every women in your family I hope you die a slow agonizing death, stupid ugly fat bitch, I hate you I hope you die on Christmas!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nCustomer hangs up. \n\nMe to me: Well it can’t get worse than that....",

Ladies, you know what I mean, the type of tone where he may has well have just flat out called me a bitch. The type of tone that imples HE is in charge and I should just shut up and listen.

And since not everyone can transport washing machines and fridges on their own, we have a delivery service for that.\nNow, customer get a timespan, so they can orientate on when they have to be home for their delivery. This timespan triggers a lot of people who are just impatient. I have calls of people complaining why there delivery isn't there yet almost everyday. And most of the time i can talk them to having a little bit more patience.\n\nBut then, a certain fella came around. So this is what happened: \n(M: Me, D: the dude who called)\n\nM: Welcome in Generic Electronics Store Cityname, my name is Ahsona Tano, how may i help you?\n\nD: I bought a washing machine and it was supposed to be delivered today, it did not arrive yet\n\nM: I'm sorry for the inconvience sir, may i ask for your delivery order number?\n\nD: It's 12345678, the delivery was supposed to be here between 10 and 14, it's not here yet.\n\nM: well, considering that it's 14:02 right now, i have to ask for a little bit more patience of you. Our delivery service is working for our customers the whole day, so it might be that the delivery and installing of other customers devices took longer than planned.\n\nD: that might be but the people from the delivery service could at least have called that it takes longer (he actually has a good point on that one) You know, i'm working for the country, i'm getting a monthly salary which is higher than you can ever dream of and i know my rights. Right now, generic electronics store is breaking the contract with us. If the delivery is not here soon, i'm going to my lawyer.\n\n\nM: i'm going to try to find out where our delivery service is right now. Please hold the line, i'll be back in just a second\n\nSo i'm trying to call the department for washing machines (they can check where the delivery people are) but no one picks up.\n\nM: thank you for patience sir, unfortunatly i can't find out where the delivery service is right now. However, i can leave a message so you get a call back.\n\nD: Listen, i have work to do, here's my phone number, if i don't get a call back until 15:00 i'm contacting my lawyer. I don't want to threaten you. Also, i want that the store manager knows about this. You're responsible for telling him, not via email, call him, or else i'm gonna drag you into this aswell. As i said, i'm not threating you. I have a witness. Contact the store manager and tell him about this. Have a nice day.\n\nAnd he hangs up.\n\nHis witness was his wife, who i constantly could hear saying things like: \"mhm, yes, exactly\"\n\nHe mentioned the \"i'm gonna get my lawyer\" part a little bit more often. \nWell yea, he did not threaten me at all. Totally not.\n\nI didn't call the store manager, i typed the situation into the calling back email which was going to department.\n",

What broke and why can't you fix it?\n\nBug: I'm from the south sir. He doesn't want to speak to someone that's not from the northern states.\n\nSB: Oooh really? I'll fix that, do you want to sit in and listen, hun?\n\nBug: SURE! Thank you.\n\nSB does his typical spill about him being a resolution specialist, that he can assist, etc.\n\nAND: OH NO. I am NOT speaking to another one of you a*holes!!! \n\nSB: I apologize sir, but unless you hang up and try to get in touch with our sister center, you will get plenty of people from SOUTHERN UNITED STATE. There is about 800 consumer care agents at this location, the other has 200. You can keep calling back again and again or let me assist you and save you some time. Sir...may I ask your name, please?\n\nAND:....I want to speak to the president.\n\nSB: I can give you an address if you wish to write a formal complaint, that is all I can give you.\n\nThe dead silence was extraordinary. I left the call in stitches because after sputtering and huffing for ten minutes the dude finally relented and gave SB the info we needed to get him service. And how did SB end the call?\n\nSB: Thank you sir, I hope ya'll have a good day now y'hear?",

        "text": "This isn't a single story I directly dealt with, but rather a series of stories I heard about in passing. This is from when I was taking calls for an appliance repair service offered through a power/utility company. In our sharepoint, there was a document detailing one customer who we absolutely were not allowed to provide service to if they ever called in, and in my downtime I researched this gentlemen independently to kill time.(I even took a call from him at one point, but it was relatively tame in comparison to some others)\n\nTo start, this gentleman's password, which he's required to confirm when he calls in, was \"The Lord's Judgement\". Maybe sets off some red flags for some sort of overly zealous dude, but not really a deal breaker.\n\nThe first time we ever sent someone out to repair something for him, he pulled a gun on the technician because they couldn't repair the item in a single visit. No shots fired, nobody hurt, police were called, and we cancelled his appliance service plan. That should have been the end of it, but it wasn't.\n\nFor months this guy called, almost every other day, yelling and screaming, asking why we won't give him appliance service. Just note after note on his account of how the CEO of this power company is *Satan himself*, and all of the employees and call center agents are demons. \n\nThis apparently eventually leads to this man verbally threatening some power line technicians that were working near to his home, though not brandishing a weapon this time. That's unfortunately as far as I could follow this ridiculous individual's story.",

This call kind of perturbed me. \n\nCall comes in with no screen pop, though was announced as a top tier call. Red flag. \n\nKeep in mind, I am being about as sincere as possible. I turn on the cheeriest voice I possibly can when working with people. \n\n&gt; Me: Good afternoon, thank you for calling the whoseitwhatsit reservations desk. My name is XYZ. May I ask who I have the pleasure of assisting today? \n\n&gt; TA: Hi! My name is [name] I have some reservations that I was wondering if you could move to another hotel for me? \n\n&gt; Me: Certainly. Where do we want to start? \n\n&gt; TA: I'll give you a confirmation number. The first one is 12345678\n\n&gt; Me: Perfect. For security reasons, could you please verify the name on the reservation? \n\n&gt; TA: [Name]\n\n&gt; Me: Awesome! I see this reservation is at the XYZ for the dates of ABC. Where do we want to move this to \n\n&gt;TA: [hotel]\n\n&gt;Me: Great! I see that the reservation itself had a cancellation deadline of up to 48 hours before arrival. Because the guest is a [Tier] Member, I will be more than glad to waive the cancellation penalty. Do you mind if I take a moment to ensure that no penalty will be charged? \n\n&gt;TA: Sure, go ahead. \n\n&gt;Me: Perfect, just one moment while I get to work. \n\nQueue the sound of \"takita takita\" in the background while I input the codes. \n\n&gt;Me: Alright! The deed has been done. I have sent emails to the appropriate people, may I ask, would you like to copy the cancellation number? \n\n&gt;TA: Nah, thats fine. The next one, I have a rewards number. 123456\n\n&gt;Me: Great! Could you please verify the name on the profile for me? \n\n&gt;TA: [Name]\n\n&gt;Me: Alright! I do see this profile does have a reservation. I do apologize, but due to the reservation being booked through [third party], I do not have the ability to cancel or modify this reservation\n\n&gt;TA: That's fine. I'll take care of that one on my side. Next, can you find the reservation for [Name]\n\n&gt;Me: I would be glad to. For security reasons, may I have the last four of the credit card that the reservation was booked under? \n\n&gt;TA: I don't have that\n\n&gt;Me: I'm so very sorry, but I cannot look up that reservation without that information. \n\n&gt;TA: Are you serious? \n\n&gt;Me: Yes sir, I am. \n\n&gt;TA: I don't have that information. Can you do any thing else? \n\n&gt;Me: I'm sorry, but the policy states that I have to have the name, rewards number, or the confirmation number, or the arrival da-\n\n&gt;TA: Cut the attitude right now.

So, people start calling asking about their ride.  I hate days when things run behind schedule, but this guy was the worst. \n\n\nMe: XYZ transportation, how can I help you? \n\nCaller: Where is my ride? \n\nMe: Let me look. Can I have your name please? \n\nCaller:  it’s John. \n\nMe: and your last name please John?  \n\nCaller:  It was scheduled for a 6pm pick up. Where is the ride? \n\nMe: I’m sorry we are late John (it’s 6:05pm). If I can have your last name, I will be able to help you. \n\nCaller:  I don’t care if you are sorry, I just want the ride. I want it now. Where is it?  \n\nMe:  John, please give me your last name and I will look it up and see where your driver is. \n\nCaller: if that van is not here in the next 5 minutes I’m going to keep calling you until you get it here. \n\nMe: I’m really sorry John, but I really need your last name to look up your account and the ride. \n\nCaller: YOU HAVE 5 MINUTES BEFORE I CALL BACK!!! \n&lt;click&gt;. \n\nI looked at the 50+ rides on the board for 6pm and none was for a “John”. Nothing I could do. \n\nMe: XYZ transportation how can I help you? \n\nCaller:  WHERE IS MY RIDE?!?! \n\nMe: Please give me your first AND last name and I will look it up for you.  \n\nCaller: it’s Fucking Smith!  Now where is my ride?!?! \n\nMe: Typed “Smith, John” into the search and surprise. No hits.  I’m sorry Mr. Smith, I don’t see any transportation orders listed under your name. \n\nCaller: I’m going to keep calling back until my ride gets here. \n\nMe: I don’t have any ride listed or scheduled for you. Are you sure you wanted XYZ transportation? \n\nCaller:  WHERE IS THE RIDE?  I’m going to to keep calling...  &lt;click&gt;\n\nThis goes on for the next 30 minutes. I got him a couple other times, and my co workers tried talking to him too without success. Some of our routes were running 30-45 minutes behind due to a large traffic accident on a main freeway causing detours and such. It sucks,  but it happens and there is not a damn thing we can do about it. \n\nMe: XYZ Trans....\n\nCaller: I’m never using your company again!  Where. Is. That Ride?!?!  My mother needs to get home to take her medicine!!  \n\nMe: Wait, what? your mother?  What is her name?  \n\nCaller: You should have it there!  The ride was scheduled for 6:pm and it after 6:30 now. \n\nMe:  WHAT. IS. HER. NAME?????  \n\nCaller :  Agnes\n\nMe: And her last name is????  \n\nCaller:  it’s Jones. \n\nMe: &lt;clicking typing &gt; thank you!  Yes I see a  ride for Agnes Jones is en route. It is running behind due to an accident on the XX freeway.  It should be there in about 10 minutes now. \n\nCaller: it better be or I’m just going to keep on calling every 5 minutes until it does. &lt;click&gt; \n\n\nCalling will not clear traffic, melt snow or magically make a vehicle appear at the curb. Calling every few minutes causes more problems and stress, but expecting me to read your god damn mind pisses me off.  Smh. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

I get it, they want to make sure their orders arrive before Christmas, but some of these people just ask too much. We don't have special powers. If we don't have the item in the warehouse at all, what makes you think I can rush it for you just because \"I want it and I want it now!\" If I already clarified, \"I cannot do this, per my supervisor,\" what makes you think demanding to speak to him will give you a different answer... some people are just really bad at listening and/or like to talk loudly over you, \n\nMe: \"Okay, so your replacement order will come this Thurs--\" \n\nCustomer: \"YEAH YOU GUYS SENT ME THE WRONG ITEM SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE-\"\n\nMe: \"You will be receiving it Thursday..\"\n\nCustomer: \"YEAH IDK WHY YOU GUYS SENT ME THIS ITEM I DIDN'T ORDER IT--\" (Customer pressed wrong item on site)\n\nMe: \"I understand, I apologize, I have issued a replacement-\"\n\nCustomer: \"OK SO ARE YOU SENDING ME A REPLACEMENT?!\"\n\nThe only highlight of the day is when I got pretty fed up and just word-vomited on the customer. She was whining about not receiving an item that was on backorder, she received the 2 other items and insisted that if she doesn't get this 1 other item by the end of this month, she doesn't want the 2 other items. So of course I start explaining the different options for returns, she kept telling me to put a note on the account, I say yes ma'am, so if you definitely do not get the items please call us or do self-service return-\n\nCustomer: \"Yeah but... but just put a note on the account because if you people don't send me this item I don't want the other 2 items!\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, I understand, you can return those-\"\n\nCustomer: \"What? And then wait? The customer has to call, the customer has to wait, don't you have customer service?\"\n\nI was going to reply when she added, \"Don't you guys keep track of our orders?\" Somehow that just really triggered me haha and I got rid of my \"nice customer service\" and replied, \"Ma'am there is no way we actively track the thousands of orders we receive. How are we supposed to know if a customer doesn't want to keep an item if they do not notify us? Your options are to call us back or self-service return on the website. Our system is not automatic, it can't read minds and know that you don't want the items you already received.\" \n\nI usually don't talk in a firm voice, I am usually a quiet, soft-voiced person, and I guess this surprised her because it went silent for a few seconds after that. She then asked for my name and then hung up.\n\nWell, she did tell me to put explicit notes on the account so my ass is saved either way! :D\n\n/rant over",

Which I ask which document but she still replies with \"The one from the website\". I ask her if it's a credit card or if it's a policy that she has purchased as there are many documents that you can find on the bank website but she refuses to offer me that info and continues to insist it's the one from the bank website. \n\nSo we go back and forth for a while and I refuse to give her the info she wants; which is that her travelling companion is entitled to all of the same benefits as she's entitled too on the travel insurance (and the travel companion isn't on any of the policies).\n\nFinally she gives up and states that she needs to call in again as I don't understand.

We have a list of questions. I ask the questions, the caller answers the questions, and then I send this up to someone else so they can get a professional to help them. If they preferred, they could do this online. It is the exact same procedure. \n\nMe: [Generic Greeting]\n\nCaller: Hi, this is Bob. I need to report a theft from two weeks ago. I have a police report.\n\nMe: All right, Bob, let's find you in the system.\n\nCaller: [provides information]. I don't know what's wrong with the world anymore. I just feel like that if someone steals, we should do what the Middle East does and cut off their hands\n\nMe: (speechless) Well, Bob, it's always upsetting to have your things stolen. I'm very sorry, but I'm going to help you through this process as quickly as I can. I'm sure you don't want to have to take so much time out of your day because of someone else's actions.\n\nCaller: No I don't.\n\nMe: Can I ask where your [property] was located?\n\nCaller: Well, it's right up by the front of the house. Not too far from it, really, I didn't want to put it too far away because I was worried about it.\n\nMe: (typing) I understand, it was near the front of the house-\n\nCaller: I was trying to answer your question! Don't interrupt me! I have it right by the house because I was worried about it being stolen, and didn't want it out of sight of the house.

Is there a best time to contact you at that number\n\nCaller: It's my cell phone, so no.\n\nMe: (sees the old phone is labeled \"Home\") Yes, sir. Can you describe the damages to [property] to me?\n\nCaller: (Describes)\n\nMe: Can I ask the police department's name and the report number?\n\nCaller: It's [Town] Police Department, of course, and the report number is [number].\n\nMe: And do you know if they have any suspects?\n\nCaller: If I had any suspects I wouldn't have called, I'd have taken care of it myself.\n\nMe: All right, no suspects. Now, I have a reference number for you, do you have a pen handy\n\nCaller: No, you know what, this is taking forever, I need to make a call, can you wait a moment?\n\nMe: Sure?\n\nCaller then proceeds to put me on mute and make a three minute call to someone. Eventually he returns to the phone.\n\nCaller: Are you still here?\n\nMe: Yes, we are almost done. Did you have a pen on hand?\n\nCaller: No! I already said no! Weren't you listening? You sound like you're reading from a script! Why aren't we done?\n\nMe: I can email this information to you, if you prefer.\n\nCaller: That's fine! Why did you do that in the first place?\n\nMe: Some people prefer to have it written down rather than emailed, so we always ask. What is your preferred email address?\n\nCaller: Use whatever's on file.\n\nMe: It looks like I have you wife's email, BobbetteLastName@wordwebsite?\n\nCaller: It's pronounced WORD not word!\n\nMe: Yes, sir, I have all that sent over. (Explains next steps.)\n\nCaller: Great. (hangs up)\n\nMost of these types of calls take under 14 minutes. This one took 30, because he refused to listen to the questions, refused to listen to me when I tried to express I had the answer I needed, and refused to give information I needed. I ended up documenting most of the call in the notes, so the next person would know what they're dealing with and just in case he decided to complain.\n\nJust... let me help you! If you don't have time for this, why did you call in right now? This happened two weeks ago, if you're pressed for time, wait until later.\n ",

        "text": "It boggles my mind how many people wait until the weekend to ask for a refill and then turn into a complete nightmare on Saturday when they don’t get it and have to wait for Monday. I don’t know what they want me to do about it. \n\nMe: Thank you for calling the medical center. How can I help you?\n\nWhiny Mcbitchface: I put in a refill request with the X clinic yesterday. Why haven’t they gotten back to me?\n\nMe: It’s the weekend so generally they aren’t able to process refills on the weekend. \n\nWM: Are you serious?\n\nMe: Yes. I’d be happy to look into your chart though and see where it is in process. [confirms chart information and sees there is a message regarding the refill] I’m going to put you on a brief hold to read the notes. \n\nI take a look at the notes. It’s narcotics so it was forwarded to the prescribing doctor for approval. As it is narcotics, it can’t be approved by anyone but that provider. There’s no way around it. \n\nMe: Thank you for holding. So I see the refill request was routed to Dr. ABC for approval. The clinic will give you a call when they approve it. \n\nWM: No! I need this medication NOW!\n\nMe: I’m sorry but it has to be approved first. \n\nWM: Well I want to speak to a doctor!\n\nMe: I can try to call over and see if there’s a nurse who can speak with you but generally on the weekends they don’t have a triage nurse. \n\nWM: Well why not?! I just called half an hour ago and someone transferred me over and I waited on hold for 10 minutes and nobody answered. \n\nMe: I’m sorry about that but the weekends are less staffed and are pretty busy so they don’t usually have a triage nurse. I’ll give them a call though just in case.\n\nWM: Yes I want to speak to my clinic but don’t put me on hold. \n\nMe: [perplexed] Um... I’ll need to put you on hold in order to call them. \n\nWM: fine! Just do it!\n\nI call. Surprise, no answer. I go back to WM. \n\nMe: I’m sorry but I’m not getting an answer. I can send them a message but again, your provider needs to approve the refill. \n\nWM: Nooooo I need this nooooow! [yes it was as whiny as you’re reading this in your head]. Get me someone to talk to now!\n\nMe: I’m sorry WM but there is nobody. \n\nWM: No you don’t understand. Get me someone. Now!\n\nMe: As I said WM, nobody is answering the phone. I can’t get you over to the clinic if nobody answers the phone. \n\nWM: There needs to be an on call doctor you can transfer me to. \n\nMe: I’m sorry but there is not. \n\nWM: Supervisor!\n——-\n\nI transferred her over and checked later. I have no idea what the supervisor told her but she didn’t get her refill. ",

I answered with the usual \n\nM: Hi you're through to ____ \n\nC: Put a manager on the phone RIGHT NOW!\n \nM: Sorry what would the problem be?\n\nC: I've never had a problem with the Irish, but you Irish people have been so exceedingly rude to me because I'm English. You think you can talk to me however you want. The last two Irish people I spoke too were incredibly rude. And I can already tell that you don't reeeeally want to help me, so save me the hassle and put a manager on now. Unless you really really want to actually help me.\n\nM: I'm so sorry they were rude to you. But I'm sorry I've only spoken about 5 words to you so how do you know I don't want to help you? I'll try to help you. (Got her account number and passed security with her and she started complaining saying the amount we were charging her was ridiculous and she wanted me to calculate her usage manually based on the meter reads she had just taken, so I calculated them and told her how much it came to)\n\nC: THAT IS WRONG!

I overhear a lot of interesting conversations working in a call center but 2 things happened today that stuck out. We’ve got a couple cs reps who get commission per payment they collect so it’s interesting to see how they deal with people trying to skirt around paying their bills. \n\n1: So she calls a customer about a late payment and get the usual “yeah I’m sorry I couldn’t make the payment but I’ll have it” but then he goes on to say he couldn’t call in the payment because he had died. He came back to life though, but after he came back to life he realized he had a warrant, so he went to jail. He’s now talking on the phone in jail, he can’t figure out if his mom is overdosing or has dementia, and his legs don’t work. But everything’s gonna he okay by the 15th so can we can call him back then.  All this for car insurance. \n\n2: One of the women has some pretty creative ways to get payments from people, specifically men. I overheard her today saying “oh Robert you’re a naughty boy...oh that’s naughty Robert.” Followed by a brief pause and then “you know what Robert..these calls are recorded so we can’t get to macking and atttacking on the phone right now but here’s my number *gives customer service number*  we’ll get this payment processed and you can call me later. \n\nYa gotta do what ya gotta do I guess \n",

        "text": "This was going to be a comment on u/wakaslocka 's [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/7gql56/first_time_ive_cried_over_a_customer_today/), but after writing 80% of this I might as well finish it and make my own post post.\n\nI work at an energy management company where sometimes we work with retail employees, the other half the time we work with technicians. Theoretically, I'm only ever dealing with professionals. Also, it kind of helps to color the story to tell you I'm a 6'4 burly bearded guy.\n\nOkay, so, about a month or so ago I'm in a que by myself at like 6 pm and I get a call from a technician doing some maintenance. He need's me to switch some lights on and off (I think) but He's talking about things from his perspective, but I don't have diagrams of what he's talking about, so I ask him to call the wires and such by their function, and not their position. for some reason he really doesn't like this and starts insisting I transfer him. Like I said, I'm the only one in this que, and while I could give him to somebody else, they all have their own work to do, so I try to take care of the guy myself. For whatever reason this guy just refuses to work with me, and starts shouting at the top of his lungs in a mater of like 30 seconds. Not just to get me to transfer him, but actual insults. One in particular \"I don't need your attitude\" even in the moment struck me as completely unreasonable thing to projectile spit style scream that at a person. Eventually I realize this guy isn't going to let help him, but like, can I really subject any of my peers to this shouty ball of hate? And keep in mind, I'm trying to decide this as he's in my ear belittling me at max volume. So I hang up, and after that, I immediately go cry. \n\nEventually, after maybe 10-15 minutes, I get my resolve back and get myself ready to take more calls.  1 or 2 call back in and guess who it is? I tried to work with them a second time only to immediately go back to abuse, at which point I'm like activity &amp; audibly crying on the line, so I hang up again. Ten minutes later comes another call back that opens with a threat. I hang up before I even get to the part where he tells me what he was threatening. Fourth call, which, again opens with a threat, so of course, I cut him off again. I'm barely holding it together at this point, a statement which should probably be read as \"Pretending I'm not openly weeping in front of my coworkers\".\n\nFifth call, he tries to stay calm, but I'm falling the fuck apart. Like, there's no way I'm not sobbing into my mike. So, I calmly say I can't work with him &amp; ask him to call back tomorrow, click. It's like 9 PM this guy has been calling back every 30 minutes or so. Every time the phone rings it's like seeing a shark fin pop out of the water because it might be this guy again. At least after that last call, there's no way he's gonna call back. He has to be able to tell how much I'm dying. He HAS to have some sort of empathy. Sixth call back ANOTHER FUCKING THREAT!\n\nFor brevity's sake I'll cut to the next day, but it ends with my coworkers demanding I take an extra break to go steady myself. \n\nSo I come in the next morning (well, afternoon) to an email from my boss. Apparently this guy called in to complain about me! Like, how do you even shout at someone so much they cry and can't keep talking and somehow still see yourself as the victim.\n\nI tell my bosses what went down, and hope the whole thing blows over.\n\nFast forward to like a week ago, because why the fuck would that be the end of it.\n\nGuy calls back. I try to work with him again. Like, after we got our bosses involved, this guy had to have had a talking to or something right? You can't tell your boss someone reduced you to tears and just nothing comes of that, right? But apparently we (as a society) can't have nice things.  \n\nHe starts doing that thing he did the first time, where he makes no sense and is generally unwilling to be helped. after a minute or two of this craziness, I think I know what he wants. So, of course, I ask him if that's what he want's. For whatever reason, that's what makes him loose his god dammed mind. At this point, I'm not even sad. I'm not even angry. I'm just flabbergasted that he clearly learned no lessons whatsoever. \n\nIn my correspondence with my boss I admit it was clearly unprofessional to, you know, Just hang up on the guy. So if I do that again, I'm a hypocrite. But if I put him back in que, there's like a 50-50 chance he's coming right back to me, and I'll have to flag somebody down and convince someone else to deal with him to transfer him to an individual and at this point we are 20 calls deep, so we're all already stressing out. I spend like a literal minute considering what to do, again, super hard to think with him screaming in my ear (my mute is one way), when I'm saved because a coworker walks past me. I grab him and have him answer on my headset, because I just need to be done with this guy. \n\nGuess what? My colleague can't figure out what he want's either and ends up sending him to a higher troubleshooting tier. This is about 15 minutes before the last troubleshooter goes home, so as he leaves, I see what shouty pants wanted. Turns out, the thing I strait up asked him about. The thing that set him off that I dare ask.\n\nSo after that I sit down and wright a big long email that basically says, well this, but like, less incredulously. I end it by basically asking that they make sure the guy know he can't just do this to people. \n\nAnd for a while I feel pretty good about myself. I may have fucked up and gotten my feeling hurt the first time, but that second time I did a pretty good job. I managed to avoid getting my soul trampled, and reported the aftermath to people who should realistically probably be the ones handling that. So, like, happy ending!\n\nWell...\n\nWriting this I realized I had yet to get a response from my bosses. Like, even the first time, he asked me for clarification, and then didn't respond after that. I literately have no indication that anything I've sent my bosses has even been received. Probably a good thing I decided to write this, because I'm making for damn sure this doesn't get to continue.

        "text": "So I work for the Canadian employment insurance program, taking calls from claimants. I've modified some details from this call to protect the caller's identity.\n\nA few explanations on the Canadian EI program (not sure if it works differently for other countries):\n\nWhen someone stops working for an employer, they'll sometimes get severance pay or other types of earnings. We divide these earnings across multiple weeks depending on how much money the person made on average for the last year or so.\n\nSo someone who gets $1500 severance pay, with an average earning of $500 per week, gets $500 evenly divided across 3 weeks. \n\nAlso, earnings are deducted at a 50% rate from your benefits. The actual formula is a bit more complex but I'll stick with this. So, if you get 300$ of EI benefits per week and you earn $100, what you get is 300-(100/2)=$250.\n\nBasically, if you earn too much in a week, you get no money from us.\n\n______\n\nSo I answer the phone to this European French fellow. Very well-spoken, very kind at first. He would like us to review his claim, as he says he feels something was wrongly calculated.\n\nSure, no problem, I'll take a look. So this guy got for $90 000 worth of severance pay that we ended up dividing across 30 or so weeks. So we couldn't give him any money for about half a year. \n\nMe: \"Sorry sir, there's really nothing we can do for you at the moment, your record of employment shows you received over $90K this month from Money Co. You'll be eligible to receive benefits in July 2018. You may renew your claim at that time, if you do not wish to continue turning in your claimant reports. I can send in a request if you wish for another agent to review your claim, but there is nothing we can do at the moment.\"\n\nHim: \"You don't understand, I put $80K of that money into my retirement fund, and I have nothing left. I might even have to pay the bills with my credit card!\"\n\nMe: \"I do apologize. Perhaps you could contact your bank to have them deposit some of that money back into your account while we review your claim.\"\n\nHim: \"You can't force me to take money out of my retirement fund! That's against the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms!\"\n\nMe: \"I'm sorry sir, you received that money. There's nothing we can do. The reviewing process may take up to 21 days.\"\n\nHim: \"21 days?! Unacceptable. Transfer me to your supervisor.\"\n\nMe: \"I can't at the moment. I could ask for him to call you back in a few hours, but he'll tell you the same things I'm telling you now.\"\n\nHim: \"Then prioritize my claim. It's very important. I don't want to fall into debt.\"\n\nMe: \"Ok. Well, can you give me more details as to your current financial situation that would warrant such a prioritization of your claim?\"\n\nHim: \"I only have $500 left in my account!\"\n\nMe: (This is only a day or two after I had to pause benefits for 3 weeks a single mother of three who hadn't eaten in two days) \"I'm sorry, sir, there's nothing in your financial situation that leads me to believe I should prioritize your claim today.\"\n\nHim: \"I'm going to have to insist. Or else I'm going to complain to my local MP. What's your name again?\"\n\nMe: \"My name is papapapapwapa and my agent number is 6969. As I told you, we cannot simply prioritize your claim without good reason.\"\n\nHim: \"You don't understand! This is the poorest I've ever been!\"\n\nMe: \"Is there anything else I can do for you today, sir?\"\n\nHim: \"I can't wait until they replace you morons with robots! Lazy ass government employees!\" *Hangs up*",

        "text": "So I've wanted to share this story for a while, because I think it's hilarious, but I wasn't sure what to change this woman's name to; it's part of what makes it so funny to me! (Don't judge, the way it sounds just tickles me and she said it maybe a thousand times :p) So I decided to make it sound as close to her name as possible, I'll call her Donna Doodle. She is not the person who called me, however.\n\n\n\nMe: How can I help you?\n\n\n\nCaller: I'm calling because every time I log in to the website, it says my name is Donna Doodle. I'm not Donna Doodle!\n\n\n\n(Odd to me, our website is for businesses and not any one individual, so there are no names that would be immediately displayed other then the business name.)\n\n\n\nMe: Ok, let me access your account so I can see your website the way it appears to you so I can see what's going on.\n\n\n\nC: It's been going on since I took over as manager, Donna Doodle is the old manager. I shouldn't have to look at her name every time I log in! \n\n\n\nMe: I understand, ma'am. Let me look at the contact information we have listed for you and the current manager's name on file. \n\n\n\nC: I already called and let you people know! I've called twice to get it through to you that I'm not Donna Doodle!!\n\n\n\nMe: I apologize for that, I do want to fix this for you today so you won't have to call again, I know that can get really frustrating. None of the contact or manager information says this name, so it appears at least on our end we have the correct information. Where exactly are you seeing this?\n\n\n\nC: Right here in front of my face! Donna Doodle!\n\n\n\nMe: Yes, but can you be a little more specific? Right hand side, left side? Towards the top or the bottom? Do you see where it says [business name] on the left?\n\n\n\nC: All I see is DONNA. DOODLE.\n\n\n\nI didn't even care that she was being bitchy at this point. I was starting to smile a little bit and fighting the urge to laugh. If it was a normal name I'd be annoyed but the way she kept saying this goofy name all pissed off was really silly.\n\n\n\nMe: Hmm, that's really strange.... I've never heard of this before. Do you know how to take a screenshot?\n\n\n\nC: A what?\n\n\n\nMe: A screenshot, like a picture of your computer screen the way it is now so I can look at exactly what you're seeing since my computer doesn't show that name anywhere.\n\n\n\nC: Why should *I* have to do anything? It's your job to fix this! I'm sick of looking at Donna Doodle and having to clear it out EVERY SINGLE DAY before I can do anything! I'm going to call every day I see Donna Doodle until I get through to SOMEONE who knows what they're doing and isn't so lazy they'd ask me to do their job for them!\n\n\n\n\nMe: (biting my lip so I don't laugh) Ma'am, I - wait, did you just say clear it out? Clear it out of where?\n\n\n\n\nC: Like I TOLD YOU, I can't do anything on your stupid site until I clear Donna Doodle out so I can put in MY NAME and password! This isn't that hard to understand!\n\n\n\nMe: So, when you load the site it automatically fills the space for your username and password?\n\n\n\nC: Yes!!\n\n\n\nMe: Ma'am, that's called autofill and is a setting on your browser. You need to delete any saved usernames and passwords on your computer to stop that. It's not very secure to have passwords saved on a shared computer, anyway, this website does have sensitive billing information.\n\n\n\nC: ...How do I do that?\n\n\n\nSo, I showed her how to clear out her browser, and fought every cell in my body from ending the call saying, \"Have a nice day, Donna!\"\n\n\n\n\n....It's not to late to change the manager's name on file, though.",

Well one day I get an elderly lady on my dialer and as I am speaking with her she tells me that she had recently had a fall and was no longer able to work and was forced onto SSI. Being on a fixed income and her husband being gone (died The year before) she was no longer able to make her payment. They had no retirement  and her husband was the main income before he died so she was barely holding on as it was with her job. At this point she is crying because she is so distraught because she always paid everything on time and now she just couldn't and everyone was calling her (she had the card for 20 years with no late payments on the account till now). She was so upset with herself for not being able to pay it but being completely broke she didn't have a choice. So I ended up telling her a secret after an hour on the phone with her that if she sent a cease and desist letter to the company they couldn't legally call her anymore. I gave her the address and told her it had to be notarized but she needed to get the address from all the people calling her and send them all letters and they would stop calling. She thanked me profusely and called me an angel and told me I saved a life today. (I think she was contemplating killing herself because of the guilt and grief) All in all I felt really good about it though.",

        "text": "I work for one of the biggest companies in the world as a higher tier support advisor in Europe region so most of the days I will be speaking with people based in Europe, Middle East and rarely Africa, but as our company offers 24/7 support to customers who are willing to pay we will get calls from American region few times in the early morning. \n\nSo here’s the story. I absolutely love America and your people but your customer support is uncomparable to what we’re used to in EMEA. We are very friendly and talk in a very casual, but respectible manner. Your clients don’t really like that as they’re used to formal and cheesy way of dealing with clients, but we don’t know where’s the caller based until we answer the call. \n\n“Hi John(cx), this is Rich speaking how can I help you today?” \n\ncx: “Thanks for not asking how I’m doing because I’m pretty eff’d up. Why you’re calling me by first name we’re not friends? Could you show some respect and call me by my second name? I’m paying your salary!”\n\nI apologised and started to adress him as Mr. N*****. We started troubleshooting and after a while he interrupts me: “Listen can I speak to someone who speaks american? I don’t understand you, you don’t even speak english.” \n\nAt this point I usually lose all the fucks I had to give and stop being friendly, but still remain polite. \n“I really apologise for this, it might be due to my accent and I will try to speak a little bit clearer so it’s easier to understand me” \n\nCx: “No, I want to speak with American advisor, you fuck off now to whatever country you came from” (I’m based in UK, not US). Then he threw another few insults at me.\n\nI usually ignore this behaviour, warn the customer that I will drop the call but today it wasn’t the case. I had a pretty bad mood and I lost it.\n\n“Excuse me sir, but I’m not based in US, I speak english better than you and I don’t understand why you insist to speak to American advisor when you’re not even American yourself?!”  (Cx was living in US for last two years, not native) \n\nAnd that’s how I got a written warning for being racist to the customer 🤷🏻‍♂️ \n\nRight now I’m looking for the new job, while still working here and decided that after the years of abuse on the calls it’s time to leave. I’m extremely patient person who loves to speak to customers but this few bad seeds absolutely ruined me mentally and I can’t do this job anymore. Kudos to all the people who lasted for years, after 3 years I give up. ",

This is not something we could do (or that could be done) easily.  At the time a customer's due date was determined by the first number on the credit card- 1 is the first, second or third; 2 is the fourth, fifth or sixth, etc.  This woman's account number started with a 9 and the due date had always been the 30th of the month; but this month her bill said it was due on the 28th and she wanted to know why we had changed it.\n\nI was baffled.  I assured her we don't go around changing peoples' due dates at random.  She was very polite, but very confused about this.  (so was I)  I asked her to hold for a moment while I looked into it.  \n\nThe evening manager was not available so I asked a couple of my coworkers if they had ever heard of such a thing happening; they all replied they hadn't.  After exhausting all reasonable paths to try and figure out what the hell was going on, I was about to get back on the phone and tell this poor woman I had no idea why we had changed her due date.\n\nThen it hit me.\n\nI got back on the phone and said, \"Ma'am, I know why your due date changed from the 30th to the 28th.  It's February.  It will go back to the 30th next month.\"\n\nShe laughed and apologized for taking my time and that she felt silly for not figuring it out on her own.\n\nI apologized for not realizing it sooner myself.\n\nTL;DR- Customer and I both forget February has only 28 days.\n",

My department is relatively small, we only have about 80-90 employees across three sites to service all loans for the bank. One of my colleagues and myself sound very similar and even our names are similar especially if you’re not paying attention. \n\nI had a customer call in, and I answered the phone as usual. Right off, the customer asks for my name again (and mistook what I said for my colleagues name), my agent ID number ( which we do not have) and my location (which we do not disclose). The customer then goes on to inform me that I currently have her on hold on the other line and I am now taking other calls and neglecting her call. I tried to explain that our phone systems will not allow me to take other calls from queue, but she didn’t want to hear that. I informed her that I’d be happy to help her, and all she would say is that she will report me and have me fired. At this point I’m slightly annoyed, and she hangs up. I proceeded to message my colleague that I mentioned before and he did have her on hold while he researched her request. I told him about what was happening and then the customer disconnected from his line as well. The same customer calls back in and gets another person who is at the same site as he was and complains and she tried to inform her that we cannot have somebody on hold, and that she really did speak to two separate people who are in two different sites and she accused her of lying and covering for us and said she would also now get the third agent fired. \n\nI cannot wait for her to call back in when management is here to try to complain, I hope she feels like a complete idiot for being so unreasonably rude. \n\nI hope this is enjoyable, I definitely got a nice laugh out of the situation.

She was very upset when she called in.\n\nNow, the problem is that in order to get an extension on her rental car, she needed to talk to a specific person. Let's call that person Ashley. As it was a Monday morning after Thanksgiving and Ashley likely had 500 people trying to talk to her, she wasn't available.\n\nI talked her into calming down by explaining what we could do. I would email her the document and then transfer her to the online account tech support. While that was happening, I would send a message to Ashley to have this woman called back within one day. I advised that we could not reach Ashley, but if she liked I could transfer her to voicemail.\n\nEverything calmed down, seemed fine, I sent the woman off to tech support and sent Ashley a message.\n\nAbout two hours later, I got another person asking after Ashley (a much more reasonable person, who accepted their callback) and got curious as to the status of the first woman. Since our encounter two hours ago, she had called in five times.\n\n1) She felt her property had been damaged by one of our business partners. She was advised to speak to Ashley, became angry, and hung up.\n\nNext, Ashley called her. She was very upset, but Ashley extended her rental and spoke to her about the property. The woman asked for Ashley's manager, and Ashley told her that the manager was in a meeting. He would call her back within one business day. The woman became irate, swore at Ashley, and hung up.\n\n2) She called in asking for the manager. Ashley's notes were not yet in the file, so we reached out to the manager who told us he was in a meeting. When we relayed that to her, she swore at us and hung up.\n\n3) She did #3, but asked when the manager would be out of the meeting. When the manager did not respond and the employee tried to advise the one day call back, the woman swore at us and then hung up.\n\n4) She did #3, just with a different person and more swearing. This person disconnected the call due to abuse.\n\nA note from Ashley, who had been transferred a call, likely from the woman calling back between #4 and #5. She advised again the procedure for the business partner (we are getting pictures of the damages and discussing if they were from what caused the original damage, or from the business partner) and asked the woman to wait for the manager to call her back. Ashley also asked her to wait two-three days for the pictures to arrive and be looked at. More swearing, more hanging up.\n\n5) She called her personal vendor (who was repairing the property) and asked if she could remove her property from our business partner. They called us, confirmed, and then conferenced in the business partner. She must have paid $75 to have the property taken elsewhere. Mind you, someone still needs to look at this property before we can pay her. We have people on site with out business partner, it's going to be at least a week before someone can go out to the new location (and get pictures of those damages).\n\nOne last note was here, which consisted of Ashley paying our business partner for their time and trouble. I really want to know how that talk with the manager goes now.",

Our department closes at 6pm Friday for weekends, and there's an \"after hours\" line for hospitals to call if something is urgent (like if the online system is down).\n\nI had a customer phone through to me at 5:55pm on a Friday saying he hadn't received a payment of $500 for his wife's dental treatment which he was *told* had been paid that morning. Apparently this guy had sent his claim in that Wednesday and called twice a day to check the progress of said claim. I checked his history and sure enough we had paid the funds into his account that morning. I explained to him that interfund bank transfers usually take overnight to appear in the receivers account but can take up to 3 business days. Apparently he REALLY needed to have the money before the weekend - well asshole, generally claims take 5 business days be verified with the provider so we have done you a favour by having it done in 2.\n\nI pulled up the claim to confirm the bank account details said claim had been paid into just to assure him the payment was on it's way. Read out the number, low and behold it was the wrong account, which was not his. Cue this guy going off and swearing at me about incompetence, saying he had put the details on his claim form and called to confirm it.\n\nI checked the audit log and saw that his account details had been changed, per the details on his signed claim form. This guy had filled out a claim form and signed it with the wrong account number, called us again with the wrong account number, and now it's our fault he doesn't have his money. I can hear him yelling at his wife \"they fucked up the claim and we won't be getting it tonight\".\n\nTold him I'd have to log a trace with the bank it was paid to, so the funds could be recovered and we can make a new payment but that could take a week. Guy doesn't seem to understand that even if I *could* make another payment now to his correct account, it's now after 6pm on a Friday so there's no way the funds will be in his account before Monday.\n\nTold him to have a great weekend and we will be in touch once the trace has come back. Cue bogan wifey in the background \"well we fucking won't be having a great weekend now will we!!!\".\n\nCame in on Monday to see he had called early that morning to tell us the money had gone into his wife's bank account - they forgot they had recently opened a second account - which was on the claim form, and the money had gone in by Friday night. I really wish the trace had gone through before he realised and the bank had stopped the payment, just so it would have taken even longer for the guy to get his money.",

        "text": "This happened about two Fridays ago. That entire week we were slammed with calls, and I think 4/5 of the calls irritated the hell out of me. I wanted to post about two in particular that made me want to quit, but I think all of us here could use a little lightheartedness.\n\nSo, for context, I take inbound calls for an insurance company in Texas. I don't actually live in Texas, we're just a 3rd party call center. Some of our members have Medicare plans, and if those members express the slightest displeasure with anything, even if it's as simple as \"Oh. Well, I wish there was a doctor a *little* bit closer... but oh well\", we have to file this displeasure for the insurance company to review it. Any other non-Medicare policy has to explicitly state \"I want to file a complaint\", but Medicare members get extra special care.\n\nI'll be Me, and Nice Grandpa will be NG.\n\n&gt; **Me:** \"Hi there! Thank you for calling Insurance Company. My name is Short-Haired Nymph, how may I assist you today?\"  \n&gt; **NG:** \"Hello, Short-Haired Nymph. I received a very disturbing letter threatening to cancel my insurance.\"  \n\nWow, okay, that's the opener. I roll my eyes and restrain from a heaving sigh as I get comfortable, already opening up the form I need to document that this member is displeased, which is separate from the form documenting anything else we discuss on this call. So I apologize to him for the confusion and the frustration, and after some questions we figure out that it's essentially just a late letter--not \"threatening\" at all, it just says if you don't pay your monthly payment, you get disenrolled. But, again, he's an elderly man, and letters like that can kinda seem scary, I guess.\n\nWell, after talking to him some more, we figure out that his automatic payments had never been set up, when they should have been from the last time he called in. Woops, someone screwed up on our end. I take a look at the previous call notes which show that he canceled his previous automatic payments, but nothing about setting up his new one. Weird. Caller tells me that they went through the new card info and everything, so now I'm thinking about how glad I am to not be the previous person the caller spoke to, because that person is going to get their ass chewed out for not following through for a Medicare member.\n\nI apologize profusely to the member, and offer to both take a one-time payment to ensure he's paid for this month, and then get him set up on automatic payments again using the new card. He accepts, and mentions that he'd like to take care of this quickly as he has a dinner date to get to and he's already a bit late. So, I take his card info.\n\n&gt; **Me:** \\*reading it back\\* \"Does that all sound correct?\"  \n&gt; **NG:** \"Yes, ma'am.\"  \n&gt; **Me:** \"Perfect! Let me go ahead and save this...\"  \n&gt; **NG:** \"Is that all you need from me? Can I go now?\"  \n\nAt this point my breath hitches because he's been nice so far, but our older and elderly members don't much like our procedures that take too long for them, and I have to tell him there's more to do.\n\n&gt; **Me:** \"I'm so sorry sir, not yet, I do need just a *teensy* bit more info from you before we can disconnect. I understand you have plans this evening, so I want to help you get this resolved as quickly as possible, okay?\"  \n&gt; **NG:** \"Oh! Oh, no no, you don't have to be sorry for anything. That can wait, this is more important, you just take your time so we can get this done right this time. My apologies. I don't mean to rush you.\"  \n\nAww... well. Okay! That's one of the nicest things an upset Medicare member has ever said to me. I thank him for his patience and we keep going. I have to go through three separate processes: I have to take down the new card/payment information and save it, then I have to take the one-time payment for the month and save *that* into the system, and then I have to get him set up on the automatic payments and save *that* info, and the auto-pay requires quite a bit more info from myself and the member than the other two processes do. Plus, I have to read back all the information to make sure it's correct so that this caller doesn't encounter the same issue again. There are also a bunch of confirmation numbers that I have to read back. So I asked the member early on (when I got his e-mail) if I could confirm letters and numbers using military phonetics.\n\nThis whole time, the caller is *incredibly* nice. That whole week I had been screamed at, hassled, interrupted--I mean the whole nine yards. And then this caller was really patient to make sure we got it all done correctly, said \"yes, ma'am\" and \"yes please\" and \"thank you\"--and I think he only interrupted me once and immediately afterward followed up with \"I'm so sorry to cut you off, ma'am; I'm just very upset about this situation, but I'm sorry, I shouldn't have cut you off. Please continue, I'm sorry.\"\n\nSo we finish up everything, and I read the last confirmation number, again, using NATO phonetics, and give my pre-close.\n\n&gt; **NG:** \"Okay, I have the confirmation. But that'll be e-mailed to me too, right?\"  \n&gt; **Me:** \"Yes sir, you should have two e-mails, one for the one-time payment and one for the auto-pay.\"  \n&gt; **NG:** \"That's very good news, that's very good. Thank you so much, Short-Haired Nymph, you have been such a huge help. Somebody really dropped the ball somewhere but you've been so patient with me and very, very sweet. Were you ever in the service?\"  \n&gt; **Me:** \"I'm more than happy to help! I've never been in the service, no. I entertained the notion briefly but, yanno, I just don't think I have the disposition, haha!\"  \n&gt; **NG:** \"I see, I see--please, please don't. You're much too sweet for that kind of life. You sound like the most adorable young lady.\"  \n&gt; **Me:** \"Aww, haha, thank you! I try! Now, I remember you said you had a dinner date, so I'll let you go about your evening, and I apologize again that we didn't take care of this for you when you last called in, otherwise you wouldn't be late today. But before I let you go, I just want to be sure, since we want to give you the best customer service, was there anything else that I could assist you with today, Mr. (Name)?\"  \n&gt; **NG:** \"Yes ma'am, you can do one last thing for me: have a blessed evening and a good holiday next week, can you do that, please?\"  \n&gt; **Me, clutching my chest because this man is SO SWEET:** \"Of course, sir, you bet I will, so long as you promise to do the same!\"  \n&gt; **NG:** \"Oh, yes, thank you very very much. You've been so sweet and such a huge help, and I *really* appreciate your patience today. Thank you, Ms Short-Haired Nymph, you take care now.\"  \n&gt; **Me:** \"You too, Mr (Name)! Thank you for calling Insurance Company, (insert the rest of my closing which is super specific to my company and I think would end up identifying them).\"  \n\nI had to deal with the dumbest, most frustrating providers, and then a lawyer calling in about subrogation who refused to speak with our legal offices who handle subrogation cases, and members who kept harassing me and bullying me--and then I took this very call about 45 minutes before I had to clock out. The call itself was only 30 minutes long, and then all the documentation I had to do took up the remaining fifteen minutes (plus it has to be reviewed as the complaints are technically considered legal documents and need reviewing anyway, but the ones filed for Medicare members are under even *closer* scrutiny). So it ended up being the very last call I took that week, on top of all the awful calls I'd taken previously. Took a huge amount of stress off my shoulders.",

We are the devil and everything that is wrong with the world.\n\nLooking back I wonder whose Cheerios I had defieled as I pulled this woman's credit ticket that was sent to me to deny or verify.\n\nCustomer stated that she never authorized x service to be added wants it credited for the three months she's had it. No biggie run of the mill ticket. I pull the call and the customer not only agreed but asked questions about said product....so here comes the call back. \n\nCustomer will be FB (take that as you will) M will be me.\n\n*Hi this is r/Navike calling you back from hell on earth cable company... Blah blah*\n\nI go through the process of explaining to the customer that we would credit her one month of the service but as she did agree we would not be able to credit more. Que the fireworks.\n\nFB *Do you have children, r/Navike?*\n\nM *No, ma'am I do not*\n\nFB *Then you have no idea what the fuck I go through with these kids distracting me while I'm on the phone. I never agreed to add x! *\n\nM *I have younger siblings I do understand they can be distracting but you asked for information about X and the agent went over the product before completing the order. There is nothing we can do.*\n\nQue massive temper tantrum (probably in front of said children) screaming about how she wasn't going to pay for any of it. Another thing to note here is that she was still being charged for the service I offered to get the services removed for her her reply:\n\nFB: *The only way you'll be removing it is if credit it back to the beginning*\n\nM *Ma'am I have already explained to you several times that you agreed to this product on a recorded line there is nothing else we can credit.*\n\nI've done this for about three years now I get it you're upset and you hate my company. Sometimes I do too... It's when they resort to insulting you I really question humanity.\n\nFB: *R/Navike I bet you didn't even graduate highschool. Did you even go to college? You're a dumb bitch and I will sue your company.*\n\nM: *Actually ma'am I did and graduated however this does not negate the fact you agreed to something on a recorded line...whether you were distracted or not this is your responsibility*\n\nQue more screaming and trying to escalate further, which she hung up in the middle of escalating. The kicker? She screamed, cursed me out, and insulted me for 20 minutes over 50 dollars. And that service is still active on her account.\n\nAnyone else in call centers detest this time of year? Seems like they crawl out of the woodwork.\n\nTldr; Insulting a reps intelligence will negate any error you make.\n\nEdit: I'm great at formatting.",

        "text": "Major telecom, collections department. \n\nToday's bright and shiny diamond is a business customer. It's an apartment complex, and the account in question is for a dedicated set of approx 4 or 5 dedicated alarm lines.  This customer has a pretty poor payment record, but because of how many other accounts they have with the company they've been able to get away with not paying regularly by threatening to disconnect all their lines with us. The bill for the alarm lines racked up to over $2000 though so it's beyond any acceptable limit even for our best customers. Multiple notices and calls were done, but they still didn't pay so we denied the service for nonpayment. They ended up calling back shortly and convinced a manager here to turn on the account if we did a post dated check payment. The manager agreed, we turned them on, but when it came time for the payment to process, the payment was rejected by their bank, so per our policy we re-denied until payment was secured. \n\nAlarm services very routinely monitor these types lines as part of their service so when the lines go down the alarm company contacts the customer pretty quickly.  For whatever reason this particular time the alarm company was not able to reach anyone for the property, so they were obligated to call the fire department in case there was a real fire that disabled the alarms. \n\nIt was shortly after the fire department arrived there that we received an angry call from our delinquent customer. \n\nCus: \"You f***ing idiots turned off the alarm lines and now the fire department is here for a false alarm. We're getting a ticket for your error. You need to turn the service back on NOW.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm sorry to hear that that happened, but unfortunately the account has gone delinquent. We sent multiple notices and calls, and we even gave you an extra chance to pay after we shut it off last week, but your payment was rejected by your bank so we had to re-deny the service. We will need all of the past due charges paid on the account first before we can restore the service again. \"\n\nCus: \"F**k you, you're breaking the law by denying this service.\"\n\nMe: \"The law states we can deny service for nonpayment if proper written notice was given. We've done that as well as attempted calls, and we also gave you a payment arrangement which you did not keep. We were within our rights to deny your service.\"\n\nCus: \"Well if you guys don't turn it back on the fire department says we have to have someone on fire watch on site until the fire alarms are back online.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but that situation can be prevented by paying the bill to restore the services.\"\n\nCus: \"Well if a fire breaks out it will be your fault and we'll sue you guys.\"\n\nMe: \"We will not be responsible for that since your account is denied for nonpay.\"\n\nCus: \"We'll see about that. I'm going to start a fire and document everything so that our lawyers can sue the crap outta you.\"\n\nMe: \"Sir, admitting to planning arson on a recorded line is not a wise move. As stated on our automated line that you listened to before you spoke with me, all of our calls are recorded. If you persist in threatening violence or committing a felony I would be required to contact our security department, who would in turn contact your local police department, who would in turn show up at your property and at the very least have a very unpleasant conversation with you. And if they arrest you we would be obligated to release this recording to the authorities where they will hear your threat. So that being said...do you wish to revise your statement?\"\n\nCus: \"...........\"\n\nAt this point all I can hear is heavy breathing plus what I can only possibly describe as maybe his fist hitting a desk multiple times. \n\nCus: \"...do you take Discover?\"\n\nMe with a huge grin: \"Why yes, yes we do...\"",
