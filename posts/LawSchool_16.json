        "text": "I am very sorry in advance for the long rant. I think I just need to vent.\n\nI am a 1L (n-KJD, late 20s) on a full scholarship at a T14. I am far from home, and even farther from my partner (who I lived with for 10 years before law school and is now pursuing a different professional degree many states away). I have no family ties and my support system is really just my partner (who is settling in well at their respective school and has made a very close circle of friends) and a couple friends who I've kind of grown apart from since I left my job and started school. I have not been feeling well throughout the entire school year, but I have been feeling especially depressed since the spring semester started - just fully dissociating in class and not even able to bring myself to read. It is getting harder to go to class/not cry in class. I have no motivation to do anything other than stay in bed all day.\n\nI have a history of mental health issues and was in therapy before law school/I am still on medication. I really don't know what's triggering these new feelings or why I'm feeling this way so strongly. I think the fact that I spend most of my time alone is playing at least a small part. Everyone I meet here is friendly, but relationships never really progress beyond a coworker-esque relationship or \"school friends,\" like I have people to eat lunch with or sit with between classes at school but once I go back to my apartment for the day/weekend, that's it. I am fully and completely alone. Several people from school have tried to reach out to me because they've noticed I'm not doing well over the past couple of weeks, but I just can't even bring myself to answer because I'm so embarrassed by how I've been acting. I also feel like me not answering these people who are concerned about me is further ruining the chances of making any friends in the future. I feel burdensome, annoying, and ungrateful. I don't feel like I deserve friends.\n\nI finished a little bit above median last semester, I have a job lined up for this summer, I'm looking at 25k debt total for this degree, I knew what I was getting myself into + know what I would want to do when I graduate. School itself is actually fine too and doesn't feel super overwhelming (except for the past couple weeks since I haven't been able to read) - I genuinely have nothing to complain about, but I've still been thinking of dropping out. I feel like a failure. I'm scared of letting down my school, the attorneys who mentored me during the years I was in the field before law school, my partner. I don't feel like I deserve to be here. I know it's pathetic to not just stick it out for 2 more years, but I genuinely don't know if I can with how I am feeling right now. I often think about just going back to the legal job I had (and loved) before law school. I don't know what other alternatives there are at this point.\n\nIt is really hard to find mental health resources in the town that I'm in (I've tried but have had absolutely no luck so far). I spoke to a therapist at my school back in the fall and it was unfortunately not really helpful or productive - they also tried to provide me with referrals in town but again, there just aren't a lot of providers here. I don't know what to do or how to fix this.",

        "text": "Hello Everyone, \n\nI am having a bit of a dilemma. I am a 1L at a T-14 with a great scholarship and tons of support from the most amazing friends, professors, family, etc. My whole life has revolved around getting into and graduating from law school. I earned okay grades my first semester, and am working on securing employment for the summer. \n\nI think I don't want to be a lawyer. \n\nI went to law school thinking it would be similar to a history PHD (history always being my first love), but with more prestige and guaranteed money/employment at the end. I never intended on taking/passing the bar because I just wanted my law degree to be the background to my career as a researcher. I am finding myself in a bit of a pickle because I am simply not interested in any legal career. I am too anxious to be in a courtroom, I don't understand contracts enough to do transactional, and I simply do not have the emotional capacity to do public interest. The only class/subject I have enjoyed is Constitutional law and I only like the historical background information aspect/learning about past laws and how they apply to current doctrine. So I guess I could become a constitutional scholar? But again, I don't want to represent anyone, I just want to research.\n\nI love my law school. I LOVE my friends, and my professors are angels. But even with everything going for me, my heart just isn't in it. I just don't care about what i'm learning. \n\nI feel like such an ungrateful brat to myself for all the insane work and sacrifices I made to get in here. But I just don't know what to do. \n\nI also feel silly and demoralized. Which I suppose is how all 1L's feel their second semester. But  I just really, really need advice. Or honestly, I need to know there are people that have felt this way and still stuck it out and are happy they did. \n\nI don't want to leave law school. It is truly the very last option for me. But I want to be happy long-term, and I don't know what path to take. \n\nPlease tell me there is some light at the end of the tunnel.",

My fall grades also turned out pretty well (half a's and half b's).  But now everything feels different.  The workload seems so much heavier and half my classes don't make any sense to me.

My transfer prospects are pretty good.\n\nDoes it make more sense to stay at my current job for this summer, since I already work in the legal field? Or should I look for a summer internship/externship/associate position? Would a summer externship or associate position at a larger firm be better for my 2L summer (and transfer) prospects than staying with my current firm through the end of this summer?\n\nI know it‚Äôs late to start thinking about this, but part-time students at my school don‚Äôt participate in OCI during 1L, and I hadn‚Äôt even considered transferring until I got my grades.\n\nIf anyone could offer any insight I would greatly appreciate it!",
