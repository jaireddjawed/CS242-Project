I’m trying to configure authenticated origin pulls with CloudFlare, and force all requests to go through CloudFlares network with .htaccess “Require ip xxx.xxx.xxx/20”. I generated an origin server SSL certificate on CloudFlare and installed it on WHM and cPanel (not sure if I was supposed to only install it on just WHM, or just cPanel, or both). I downloaded the CloudFlare specific CA (authenticated_origin_pull_ca.pem) and put it in /etc/cloudflare/authenticated_origin_pull_ca.pem. In WHM I added the following to Server Configuration &gt; Apache Configuration &gt; Include Editor &gt; Pre Main Include (Global)\n\nSSLVerifyClient require\nSSLVerifyDepth 1\nSSLCACertificateFile /etc/cloudflare/authenticated_origin_pull_ca.pem\n\nAfter restarting Apache, I get 502 Bad Gateway. I tried adding the “Require zip XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX” rules to .htaccess and uploaded that to public_html on the cPanel FTP.\n\nIn CloudFlare I have SSL/TLS encryption mode set to “Full”, and Authenticated Origin Pulls enabled.\n\nAny ideas on what I’m messing up here?any help is greatly appreciated",

        "text": "Digital Currency Group (DCG), the most important and at one time one of the most valuable companies in the American cryptocurrency economy (and maybe the entire world's crypto economy), [has been in a world of shit lately because of the collapse of Genesis Trading and Genesis Capital](https://cryptadamus.substack.com/i/89744331/ω-the-war-of-the-whales-bro-will-set-upon-bro), one of the 3 jewels in its corporate crown (and also one of the only subsidiaries that actually made money - the others are Coinbase and Grayscale / GBTC) what with owing at last count somewhere between $2 to 4.5 *billion* to various parties including $900 million owed to retail users of Gemini, the Winklevoss's twins startup that it was refusing to pay. [Here's the job posting](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6970407696424394752/). Also worth knowing that 69 people work at grayscale and roughly 100 at parent company DCG.\n\n\\---------\n\nHere's why that job posting is one that at least raised my eyebrows because you *might* (not super high confidence, just so we're clear) post such a job listing after a major security breach:\n\n**\"actively searching\"** usually means one of these things:\n\n1. a contract or board member required it (ok)\n2. someone just turned in their resignation (prolly ok depends on the reason for the resignation)\n3. someone had to be fired (not ideal)\n4. you never had anyone in the role before and now you really need them ASAP (bad)\n\n**\"link designs to outcomes/operational effect\"** is concerning because\n\n1. suggests there was some kind of previous design but it did not result in the desired outcome\n\n**\"cloud security standards\"** is ominous because for any company formed in the last 10 years:\n\n1. company data is *all* in the cloud including keys¹ and so on. with the right SSH/AWS credentials attackers have literally everything.\n2. a startup finding out it did too little too late as far as designing (and enforcing) a set of security protocols for employees is an extremely common, x10 for rapidly growing startups run by rich and overconfident 25 year old men. i can almost basically guarantee you that the \"security protocol\" started out as security keys¹ in a shared google doc.\n3. a lot of startups that get hacked are companies run by 5 people that make shit like dog toys. DCG would be literally the most targeted company in the world.\n4. almost all catastrophic breaches of companies formed in the last \\~8 years are cloud data breaches and so are most catastrophic breaches of companies formed more than 8 years ago\n\n**\"technical risk assessment\"** is ominous because\n\n1. suggests you may have misassessed some risks in the past\n\n**\"4 months ago\"** is concerning because:\n\n1. the LastPass breach happened in August 2022 (AKA a little *before* 4 months ago)\n2. The Apple security breach - the major one that meant that all iPhones and Macs on the planet could be easily compromised via a 0 click attack - was announced in late August. Odds that DCG bros weren't using iPhones? you tell me. And again, DCG would be among the most targeted institutions in the world. [even i got hacked at that time](https://cryptadamus.substack.com/p/the-crypto-bros-hack-back) and i was only talking about crypto on the internet for like a month at that point. point being: if they had time for me they definitely had time for every single employee at DCG/Grayscale/etc, all of whom happily identify themselves on LinkedIn.\n\n**the stuff that's not there** is ominous because:\n\n1. Grayscale is a financial company managing a publicly traded instrument (GBTC). While I'm not familiar with the specifics of running an ETF there are usually absolutely scads of regulations about compliance that come with handling money²and usually a whole lot more that come with being a publicly traded stock. these regulatory requirements are usually attached to certain laws, e.g. Sarbanes-Oxley or Dodd-Frank or whatever. if they were hiring for *that* kind of security they would say so. but they're not -CISSP is a legit certification but not for that kind of thing.\n\ni would also call **generally concerning** stuff like:\n\n1. a multi billion dollar company where the best engineers will be drawn from the pool of people willing to risk the reputational damage of working in crypto\n2. most of the employees will not even be engineers, they will be finance bros. probably finance bros that got fired for or never hired at places like JPMorgan Chase or Bank of America. let's just say that getting them to consistently follow security protocols is gonna be a challenge.\n3. most of those employees who are not engineers will be making contact with digital assets.\n\nCurious if this crowd agrees.\n\n    𝛀 𝛀 𝛀 𝛀 𝛀 𝛀 𝛀 𝛀 𝛀 𝛀 𝛀 𝛀 𝛀 𝛀 𝛀 𝛀 𝛀 𝛀 𝛀 𝛀\n\n¹ the \"not your keys not your coins\" kind of keys\n\n² rules about storing credit cards are for instance one thing i'm vaguely familiar. the regulations are basically so rugged that no one stores credit cards, they hire special companies that store their hard drives in like atomic bomb shelters with 7 kinds of enormous locks to store their customers' credit cards for them. obviously DCG is not processing payments but the point is that government requirements can be kind of extreme.",

I feel really guilty because it's comfortable and cushy, but I don't feel like it fits my personality. I'm not really learning anything, and I hate having to persuade people into following best practices. \n\nLately I've been thinking of switching to working in a SOC since I really want to work a 3x12 schedule where I work 3 days a week in 12 hour shifts. I also really like the idea of monitoring for issues, responding to alerts, and creating tickets etc. I know people say it's mundane, but it sounds kind of satisfying to find an issue and resolve it or escalate it to the right person. I don't like having to focus on the big picture/strategy behind my work which is what I do now. I work best when I'm assigned tasks that I can consistently execute to completion. It feels more fulfilling and organized.\n\nMy only concerns are that I've seen SOC Analyst salaries and they seem much lower than my current salary. I've also heard that working in a SOC is a dead end. Is it a bad idea to switch from my field? What are your thoughts? Thanks!",

If you look for toolsets, everything is pretty straightforward on Windows, slightly less on Linux, but there is plenty of information and MacOS X.. seems to be.. cursed?  \n\n\nEverything starts with the acquisition phase. It must be simple, right? You need three images: a byte-accurate disk dump, decrypted disk dump suitable for analysis detachable from the T2 chip, and a memory dump. NO.   \n\n\nEvery tool out there is either 10 years old and does not work on modern MacOS, or is designed for LEAs and other entities who have forensic investigations as a core business or at least someone's day job. With a corresponding price tag attached.   \n\n\nEvery article out there is either hopelessly outdated or incomplete, or it is SEO-facelifted copywrited 10 years old content, or suggests silly things like using rsync for forensic imaging.  \n\n\nIf you look into Volatility framework manual, it explicitly says:  \n\"Volatility does not provide the ability to acquire memory. We recommend using Mac Memory Reader from ATC-NY, Mac Memoryze, or OSXPmem for this purpose. Remember to check the list of supported OS versions for each tool before using them.\"  \n\n\nGuess what? **None** of these tools work today. Not a single one.  \n\n\nIt does not get any better on the next stages. Say, all information on hunting sleeping Cobalt Strike beacons is heavily Windows-centric.",

Both options have their benefits, but I wanted to get some opinions from others who may have more experience with these types of decisions. One potential advantage of self-hosting is that we have the ability to monitor and set up alarms for detection, which could be beneficial for security purposes.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the Bitwarden cloud vs self-hosted options? Are there any other password management solutions that you would recommend for a company of our size?",

I’d like to learn how to like reinstall it, install new operating systems like Linux or whatever that are secure on it, I don’t really know actually but basically just learn how to do different things on it just for funsies and as a hobby. Right now I basically just use it to stream jazz music or sounds of nature in the background for my room lol. \n\n1. What can I do with this to learn fun computer things like learning how to wipe and reboot windows 10 and installing Linux what other operating systems are there? What should I do with it? Like I want to train myself to be like an IT person almost, I’d be excited to learn. **Asknetsec is there a way that I could learn to like plug in an android and learn how to see if there is malware or viruses on it and do like cybersecurity analysis? Or would that be too advanced?\n\n2. What resources do I have to learn these things? Right now I’m planning on just using YouTube Reddit and google. \n\nIf you don’t know but know of resources I should check out I’d appreciate that as well. Thanks!",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI'm working on a presentation about the Solarwinds incident. I want to analyze the threat actor through the diamond model (DM). I've researched the DM and understand the basics i.e. the four edges, its meta-features and the possibility to synthesize (introducing LKC as the phase) with other CTI models. Basically, I want to create an activity thread for the different \"incidents\" (Sunspot, Sunburst, Teardrop &amp; Raindrop). But when I start looking into how to do this, I don't feel as if I'm understanding it.\n\nHere is an example picture of an activity thread: [https://i0.wp.com/www.activeresponse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DiamondModelActivityThreads.jpg?fit=550%2C404&amp;ssl=1](https://i0.wp.com/www.activeresponse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DiamondModelActivityThreads.jpg?fit=550%2C404&amp;ssl=1)   \n\n\nWhat I don't understand about the activity thread is:\n\n* Does the arrow edge placement on each diamond mean something? Or is it simply to show the lateral movement between different incidents and understand the flow of the attack? \n* When and why should I introduce multiple diamond shapes into one cell of the activity thread?\n* Why are some diamonds and arrows dotted?",

        "text": "**Clarification.** By backdoor I mean, for example, the  OS developer deliberately leaving vulnerabilities, sharing them with a  front organization (NSO Group) which could then develop the spyware (Pegasus) based on them and offer it to intelligence agencies of  friendly governments.\n\n**Questions.**\n\n1. Would this process be easier than just executing a zero-lick attack?\n2. This might work for Apple with iOS but I don’t know how difficult  would it be for Google to introduce vulnerabilities and let it go  unnoticed for a lot of time in Android which is open source. Does the  incident of polkit privilege escalation vulnerability being unnoticed  for 12 years show that it could also be possible to do with Android?\n\n**Motivation.** (This is unrelated to this sub but I'm  just adding this so that people could understand why I'm asking this.)  First, revelations of PRISM showed that both intelligence agencies and  all the major OS developers for smartphones would be willing to  collaborate on such a program. Second, this strategy would make it safer  for both since it would limit the number of insiders who are aware of  this and also offer them plausible deniability in case the front is  caught. They could have multiple fronts working at the same time which  can undergo closure/prosecution and be replaced as and when they are caught.",
