        "text": "So a while back my uncles neighbor died. He was a very nice old man and gave my uncle a lot of land for a cheap price because my uncle sold him some land right by his house to avoid him being land locked. (this was years ago) and due to my uncle selling part of his land and it being close to the house, this mans mobile trailer was pretty close to my uncles house.  (the old mans property was shaped like a thin triangle and he had to have a certain clearance on the sides and front of his property to put a mobile home.)\n\nfor all these years, there has been no problems between the 2 and they even invited him over for thanksgiving a couple of times when his family wouldn't be able to attend. \n\nAfter he died, his son moved into the trailer and this is when it started going to go down hill. My uncle has to wake up at 4:15am to be at work by 5:00am. Richard (the son) would play music until 12-1am. My uncle went over there a couple times to ask him to stop. Which he basically replied with, I move out of the city to BFE for a reason. This of course, frustrated my uncle which led to the police being called.\n\nThe issue was resolved for a while and when it started back up was only a couple of times a week. It was still an annoyance though. About 3 weeks ago, my uncle goes to his mail box and saw he received some mail for Richard. he starts the walk to his front door only to see Richard bust open the door and jump the stairs and rush to his car. As he was running he said \"late for a job interview ill be back in a minute\". My uncle returned home and started doing whatever he had planned around the house. Couple hours later, Richard returns and my uncle goes and gives him the mail. \n\n\"Sorry for rushin out, I was late for a job interview which I didnt end up getting it anyways\". My uncle asked what it was for and Richard said fork lift operator. My uncle realized that he had a golden opportunity. He told Richard that the place he worked was in fact hiring for lift drivers and to apply. \n\nRichard ended up applying and getting the job, and telling him he started the following Monday. My uncle knew that if he were to get hired, he would be the morning shift which starts at 4:30 resulting in him having to wake up around 3:45 at the latest.\n\nSunday night, before his first day my uncle let all the dogs out that night and let them bark all night, he set off his car alarm \"on accident\" around 12 am and he borrowed a big speaker from my other uncle and turned it up and watched Saving Private Ryan. Needless to say, the next day when my uncle happened to run into him he looked like a zombie. My uncle went up to him and said hey what's up? Richard responded with, just learning my way around here. I dont know how you get up this early everyday. My uncle proceeded to say well it is hard to get a good nights sleep with a lot of noise in the middle of the night.\n\nThere was not a oh shit moment on Richards face. He held his zombie face and said yeahh true. However, since then there has been no loud noise coming from his house after 8pm. Even on nights we know he does not have work the next day.",

Jim is one of those guys who just comes across as skeezy.\n\nAnyway, Tara's phone went off one night last week waking her up. Brad happened to be on a business trip. It was a message from Jim. She looked, saw it was a dick pic and some text like \"I know you're hot for me, Tara\". \n\nTara posted a screenshot of the dick pic and the text to social media flagging Jim, their mutual friends, and Jim's wife. Tara then turned her phone off and went back to sleep. \n\nTara realized her phone was still off late the next day. By the time she realized this, her social media blew up - Facebook and a bunch of other ones I don't know about. She had a few dozen calls from Jim, who she then blocked, and a text from Jim's wife thanking her.\n\nShe told my wife about this earlier this evening and we've been laughing about it since. Tara will probably get a ban or some nonsense from Facebook maybe but I think it was worth it. \n\nOh, some of their friends turned the dick pic into a meme drawing a face on it, drawing clothes and a hat in it, and adding different jokes in a word bubble as if the dick was talking. There's a whole messenger group chat going on about this still.",

        "text": "There was another story on here about neighbors playing music way too loud and needing a big of musical justice. It reminded me of something similar. \n\nMy roommates were a couple who also happened to be good friends of mine. We shared an apartment with us on the top floor of a two-story complex. My bedroom was in the back, and theirs in the front. Their bedroom was also next to the balcony. \n\nWe lived in an area of town that had a lot of college kids. This was never an issue. What did become an issue was a group of guys that moved in below us and decided that random weekdays were the best time to throw parties, or generally be extremely loud with music and being outside on their balcony. \n\nMy roommates both went to them and asked nicely to keep the music down at night, or to have their parties during the weekend when they didn't have to work. I really didn't hear any of the parties because of where my bedroom was. But they kept on with their parties and seemed to not care. \n\nI decided to take some revenge of my own, because I don't like when people mess around with my friends. I knew they usually stayed home, unless they left for classes. I had my friends tell me when the next party happened and I waited for both of them to leave for work. The downstairs neighbors were still playing loud music too. \n\nAt the time, my stereo had two obnoxiously large speakers. The kind that double as end tables. Along with a powered subwoofer. I like playing retro games, so I busted out Doom 64. I don't remember the level, but it was one that had a lot of enemies in an open field and I think the music also had crying babies? Either way, I played that level on the loudest my speakers would take for several hours. I kept the difficulty up so that I would actually try to beat the level. I made sure to point the speakers down because I didn't want to hurt my hearing in the process. When I finally turned it off, I didn't hear any more music. The rest of the time we were there (which was only a few more months) my roommates didn't have any more noise issues. \n\nThey still had parties, but it was way more reasonable and they didn't keep it going all night during the week.",

Our neighborhood is all houses with your average sized driveways, and typically each neighbor helps out each other if needed.  We all talk and if they find out your equipment (plow snowblower etc) is down and will usually help you out except for Dawn who is the newest neighbor to the block, somewhat older, and has her driveway plowed unprofessionally by somebody.  Dawn just happens to live next to me up the street and when the plow comes by anything left by her plow guy gets places in my driveway. Enough back story. \n\nDawn’s plow person has on several occasions plowed her snow from her driveway into my yard. This causes the city when they plow the road to have all the accumulated snow in my driveway. Several times I’ve asked Dawn not to have her guy do this to no avail. Yesterday we just got 14 inches of snow. \n\n99% of the time I just use my snowblower to clean it up but I had a thought and some pretty revenge. I borrowed my friends plow truck and completely plowed my driveway and front quarter of the front lawn into her driveway. Then sat back with a cup of coffee and watched as Dawn tried to pull into her driveway and couldn’t. \n\nIt took her guy almost 3 hours to clean it up, all the other neighbors have expressed as well where to put her snow. Did I mention she isn’t well liked in the hood.",

His apartment was rent controlled, so he was paying like $300 a month in a $700 or so market.\n\nHe couldn't find another place, so I let him move into my spare room (temporarily). What I didn't know was that his whole building was *infested* with roaches. Unsurprisingly, his stuff was infested, so when he moved in, I got roaches. He promised he'd get an exterminator, but he didn't. He eventually moved out since he wasn't paying rent.\n\nI kept the roaches at bay with home traps for a long time, but I eventually moved to a different city and left my house behind, renting each room individually (I was losing money -- I'm generally a fuck landlords type of person). \n\nThe tenants were even worse. That's a whole nightmare story in itself, but ultimately, these roommates brought in bedbugs, rats, mice, and the roach infestation got a thousand times worse. I wasn't there to know the state of the place. There were literal swarms of bedbugs underneath the floorboards in one of the rooms. \n\nWhen I did realize how bad it was, I kicked them all out and decided to sell the house. As I was doing this, I found the original roommate's stuff in my attic space. I contacted him, scooped up some bedbugs from the swarm, and sprinkled them throughout his stuff.\n\nTo this day, I wonder if he ever got an exterminator.",

We get out of the car and start hauling his gear out of the trunk, when we heard a loud explosion and saw the bright flash of an electrical transformer failing.  The lights in the rink parking lot go out, but the lights inside are still on, so we still head inside. \n\nThings are normal and the rink is busy.  A game on the main rink, multiple other teams awaiting their game time and teams practicing on the studio rink (1/3rd size sheet of ice.)  We go into the locker room and the LED lights in the ceiling are flashing at a very uncomfortable to view rate. \n\nI also smelled an electrical fire.  \n\nLong story short, the rink employee put out a fire in the compressor room, which is completely dark as well.  He tells me and one other person that arrived at the compressor room that the building needs to be evacuated.\n\nSo we move the get the 200 people out of the building.  The issue was that the kids were scared of the locker room lights flashing and would not go in to get their gear. I can kind of understand, as the LED ceiling lights were doing a great simulation of electrical arcing.  So a lot of people are waiting around in the lobby.\n\nI had been very vocal and ordering people around, so when I was moving through the lobby, Karen makes her appearance.  Typical, overweight, peroxided hair, the works.  She stops me and demand to know what I'm going to do about getting their kids' gear out of the locker room.  \n\nI take a moment to think and ask her name.  She replies \"MRS BITCHY MCBITCHFACE\" a bit too loudly.  \n\nShe wanted to fuck around, so I raise my voice to its \"find out\" level and get EVERYONE's attention.  I point to her and say \"THIS IS MRS BITCHY MCBITCHFACE SHE HAS VOLUNTEERED TO CORRIDINATE WITH ALL THE TEAMS AND PARENTS TO GET THE KIDS' GEAR OUT OF THE LOCKER ROOMS.  ANY AND ALL QUESTIONS GO TO HER! SHE WILL WORK WITH YOU TO GET THE KIDS' GEAR!\"\n\nI turn around and get lost in the crowd that is now closing in on her.   Why the hell each teams' parents and coaches couldn't go in and get their gear out of the locker rooms is beyond me. \n\nI have to admit though, Mrs Bitchy McBitchface did get people moving and the rink was evacuated not too long after our encounter.",

Not only was she late with paperwork,  she was unpleasant to be around, she dressed totally inappropriate for a business casual office and her work was fairly subpar, I honestly have no clue how she landed the job.  So fast forward to the month before Xmas,  she kept taking time off without pay or going through proper procedure to take time off without pay.  Although I kept telling her to use her vacation time, she refused to use it as she wanted to save it to be guaranteed time off later.  So my petty revenge?  She didn't have enough paid days off for three statutory holidays over the Christmas break!  I KNEW that would be the consequence, but I didn't tell her.  I just made sure I sent an email beforehand stating 'please use your vacation time for days off',  just so she would respond in writing.    \n\nOf course she called me telling me I made a mistake and forgot to pay her,   the best part?  She connected the dots really quick,  and that it was a direct result of her hoarding vacation.    It's petty revenge but non the less it gave me pleasure that her stupid hoarding came with a consequence!  She was let ago about six months later due to organizational changes.",

        "text": "For context, I work at a college as an IT. My boss is a terribly lazy asshole who gives no direction and only reaches us to do something so he doesnt get in trouble. Oh and he always gives us major tasks so he doesnt have to get up from watching netflix all day.  But just this one time because he gave no direction, I pretty much ratted him out by accident saying to a professor, \"Sorry that we couldnt help you with this, I was given this task with no proper training on how to use this device\". It was in the moment that it wasnt meant to backlash him, it was just the truth. He didnt even tell me he was pretty much pissed and gave me a lot of work that's not part of our job description until I pointed it out and he got more pissed.\n\nHis revege: I asked him if I can take the rest of my parental leave back in September for the month so I can spend more time with my son. He didnt answer for nearly 2 weeks so I asked him again. He said no because that's when the semester starts and it's the busiest. As much as I understood, It was annoying finding this out much later but I understood. Didnt think of it at the time so I didnt bother to fight it. Then literally a few days later, my recruiter called me to tell me that my contract was ending on SEPTEMBER. Confused, I asked her if she's sure about it because my boss kept telling me what the plans are for that month. She contacted him and confirmed immediately. I really didnt know how to take this but as soon as I processed this, I was pissed. \n\nMy little revenge: My old job contacted me for a much better oppurtunity and pay so fate was on my side with this. This gave me the option to not give a fuck anymore about this job. So because I dont even see my boss a lot in the first place, I decided to just not show up to the office for 3 weeks straight. I would of told them if they asked but not at all that they realized I havent been showing up\n\nMy petty revenge: After the 3 weeks and turned in my things, thats when I decided I'd make my boss more useful. Because that I gotten to know the security on campus, they didnt know I reassigned. Since my new job is close to the university, I decided to stop by, walk past the security and completely unplugged a lot of devices some for display, cameras, microphones, and other types of systems on his zone so he has to resolve them. I also switched up the settings before unplugging them so that when he does think he resolved it, he has to spend another 20 minutes or so readjusting the settings. I did this once a week for about a month straight. I made sure to make it really complicated by taking out the cables completely and throwing them away. I also made sure that the coworkers I do get along with there were in work meetings they cant leave so they didnt have to resolve those issues. Wish I can see my boss lose his shit because it would of been the most he's ever done for this job.",

        "text": "In short, a guy, leader of a \"gang\" didn't stop bullying me and my girl friends - we were 12 or 13. No one could stop them. My best friend was the most bullied of all, because she was bow-legged (so extreme she had surgery years later to protect her lower vertebrae). She was also very thin, had bushy hair, shy and mentally frail, because her mother was mentally ill and she was the least liked of the 6 siblings. So I was very protective of her, gaining courage against bullies even though I was shy and not malicious like them.\n\nHe and his two best friends had an ultimatum from school. One more detention and they would be expelled in the middle of the year.\n\nI was a straight-A student, a model student. Which teacher would doubt my word?\n\nThe main guy sat behind me for an essay exam. I was fuming, but I wrote my essay. Then I scrambled the paper and through it out the window. Got up immediately and said: teacher, he took away my essay and threw it away. The boy was shocked, being accused even being innocent (he had gotten away with misbehavior multiple times). Someone went down to recover my essay. We went to the principle's office and I swore he had thrown my essay away. He was expelled from school.\n\nSecond boy. There was a canopy dirty and wet due to recent rain. I made sure no one was looking and shook up the pole, thus making the whole canopy collapse. This time me and my two best friends swore the boy had done it all by himself.\n\nThe third boy - his parents called to apologize to me and my friends, the boy was crying in the back, she said she took his TVs privileges and vacation and that it would never happen again. He was not expelled. We're even FB friends now. \n\nI\"m mellow now, but don't go mess up with 13yo me.",

        "text": "Posted this in ProRevenge when I was a Reddit Noob but it got kicked for being petty. So here you go.\n\nSorry for the wall of text. This happened many years ago and occurred over several weeks. My bf at the time worked as an electrician in a factory and had to be up very early every morning to make it to work on time. He had recently moved to a brand new apartment building and was, in fact, the first tenant to move in. \n\nEverything was going great until about 3 weeks later when he got new neighbors directly upstairs. They were young... college aged, where he was in his mid 20's. And they liked to party. Boy, did they like to party. Not just on the weekends, but every. dang. night. And they were LOUD. So loud that his dishes would rattle in the cabinets, every. single. night. \n\nHe went through all the proper steps to try to correct the problem. He approached the new neighbors  directly, knocking on their door and politely explaining that he had to be up early to go to work etc., could they please turn the music down. This would be at 11 or 12 on a week night. They would turn the music down, but 15-20 mins later it would be blasting again.\n\nHe reported them to the property manager. If mgt did anything at all it was completely ineffectual. Reporting them to the local police resulted in the music being turned down for one blessed night, but eventually the police just stopped responding because as said before, this was an issue every night. \n\nSo now it was time for some petty, but very effective revenge. My bf's favorite band was AC/DC. He had six speakers attached to his turntable ( I told you this was a long time ago), two of which were woofers (base speakers) that, when turned about 2/3 of the way up, did more than vibrate the dishes. They vibrated your whole body, to the point where your heart rate aligned with whatever song was playing and your teeth rattled with the beat. \n\nOne morning after a particularly long and noisy night from the upstairs neighbors, my bf took milk crates (free furniture. Google if not familiar) and stacked them right up to the ceiling in two stacks, leaving just enough room to place his two woofers between the top of the stack and the ceiling with about 8 inches of space between them and the ceiling. At the time, there were no other tenants in the building, it being brand new and all. \n\nBf put his favorite AC/DC album, Highway to Hell, on his stereo and set it to repeat indefinitely. Then he cranked it up. Waaay up.  And went to work.\n\nWhen he got home the stereo was off and there was a notice on his door from the apartment complex... something to do with a noise ordinance or whatever... I would like to point out again that apartment mgt had been completely ineffectual in ending the noise problem from upstairs prior to this. Also of interest is that the notice from the complex was just a warning, as they could have evicted him at that point. They were aware of his problems with the upstairs neighbors, so I'm assuming that's why they cut him some slack. I suspect that while they had to issue the warning, they might have secretly been hoping he would be able to get the noisy tenants to leave. \n\nWhatever. There was no noise from upstairs that night, but the next morning, bf put the same album on repeat at a lower, but still significant volume. At this point he really didn't care if he got kicked out. He just wanted to be able to sleep at night. \n\nThis time the stereo was still on when he got home, and still on repeat. Never again heard a peep from upstairs, and within two weeks the whole building was empty again, except for my warrior bf. It soon filled up with much quieter, respectful folk. Word got around about what my bf had done, and for the rest of his stay there, he was well known and treated like Superman.\n\n\nTL, DR. Little poops think they are pros at noise pollution, find out what amateurs they truly are. Forced them to move.",

I've talked to them a few times when the parties have gone past 1 or 2am (my bedroom window faces their yard, so I can't sleep when they're making a ton of noise). \n\nI have a fire hydrant in my front yard. A few times, their guests have parked in front of it. Once, I went over and asked that they not do it, as it's a safety issue. The wife SCREAMED at me (I'm 35f, and have a loud voice, so I'm sensitive about people saying women shriek, but she was legit yelling. Her friends had to pull her away from me) about how they've lived here 20 years and nothing happened, no one else thought it was an issue, etc. I ended up going to my front yard to water plants, and the owner of the car in question came over and introduced himself, apologized, and I offered to move my car up so he could park in front of my front walk and not block the hydrant. Overall, our interaction was polite.\n\nI still had an axe to grind against wife-neighbor. There had been a few other interactions between us that made it clear she's not very nice. So, one day, when I had a rotisserie chicken that had passed its sell-by date, I left it in her backyard. Totally petty and indirect, but it made me feel better.

        "text": "A little background: \n\nFrom 2017-2020 I worked at a particular West Coast grocery store. We offered low prices to customers because we bought overstocked goods and items that were rejected by major chains because they had funny labels such as entire production line of a frosting can that had black and white labels. It was owned by a local couple where the husband had come from a grocery department background and the wife was head of Non-foods (vitamins, health &amp; beauty, toys and office supplies) from the respective store they originated from. For retail work, this was an incredible store to work for. The employees were treated as humans and pizza parties were not the moral booster. Problem customers were asked to not return and creeps were reported to the police. It was a safe place. \n\nFor customers it was a place where you could get items you never thought you needed and food products that would beyond the average man's paycheck had they bought it at the store that usually carried it. Think delicious cheeses, expensive wines, and organic health foods. One of our selling points was that we had 100% money back on anything you returned so long as we had sold it to you in the past 30 days. It meant you could eat 80% of container of ice cream, claim you didn't like it, and return it. This never bothered me as most people didn't take advantage of the situation and those who did- it wasn't me losing any money and I couldn't get in trouble for their silly returns. \n\n\nTo the story: \n\nAfter three months of being there they put me on the non-foods department. I loved working the aisles but with it came one stress: people sampling our products. There were notices posted by the lotions, hairsprays/gels, and deodorants that you could not sample a product but if you didn't like a product you could return it no questions asked. If these hadn't been posted when I started working or had it not been a rule, I would have never been mad about it. I think you should get to sample creams you're going to purchase prior to buying in case you don't like the smell, but the rule was in place and my OCD made me internally irrate when people would sample. At work I'm a strict rule follower but could give two rusty nickles about what they do. It's their dime and the company's time- not mine. Furthermore, spraying scented products to sample was seen as incredibly rude because it made people with bad allergies avoid the aisle. Don't spray fragrances at the store, you could be making someone very sick. \n\nSo after a fashion of wrestling with my OCD and internal screams I decided to enact malicious compliance and petty revenge with the rule, especially when it was a long time customer who knew about the rule. Whenever someone would sample a product I would walk up very quietly and greet them with doe eyes and say, \"I'm very sorry, but we don't offer samples on any of our products,\" to which they would almost always reply \"Oh I am sorry, I didn't know,\" and then proceed to leave said product on the shelf and walk further down the aisle. I would snag said bottle and walk with them for a minute with the product displayed in my hand like a Deal or No Deal showcase model and say, \"I'm sorry but since you technically opened and used the product you're going to have to purchase it- but don't worry, if you didn't like it you can always return it!\" They would grimace and reluctantly place it in their basket and walk away. \n\nIf they tried to pull a fast one and leave it in another aisle or flat out ignore what I said it would magically appear at the register they checked out on. They would then be forced to purchase it at checkout. And of course if they truly didn't want it they were allowed to return it right then and there which was a whole separate process from their original purchase. They would have to complete their transaction first and then open a return ticket following payment. Mind you we had no customer service desk, our registers were full survice. \n\nWe had to write out the reason for return on a return ledger and they had to sign it with their full legal name and phone number as well as electronically process the return where a manager would come and punch in their code to accept the return. This could take anywhere from three to ten minutes depending on lunch breaks, what time of day it was, and how busy we were. It never failed to piss off the people behind them, but not at me because the whole time I was communicating with the line that formed what was going on and why and calling backup cashier as needed (three is a crowd rule). By the time the customer was done they were either defeated or fuming but silent because they knew they messed up and were the ones causing a disruption of customer flow and eating their own time and because I was a chatty, upbeat cashier most of the time people stayed in my line so they could be checked by me and would glare at the person returning something the entire time. \n\nWe didn't have many repeat offenders of the \"no samples\" rule.",

        "text": "Last October I decided to switch my mobile phone network (this company also provides wifi and cable services) and get a family plan with my brother with another company. I called the customer care to end my service, and the person was an A-hole who tried to stop me by saying things in a very condescending tone like- oh you’re gonna regret switching, what network are you swithing to? Ohh that one sucks. I kept requesting to stop and he kept pushing me so I asked if I can do it from my app. He said that he would discontinue it from his end but I would need to log in and confirm and while I was figuring that out- he said ‘Why am I needed here when you’re logging in?’ So I said- you’re right this hasn’t been helpful at all and I hung up and let it go. I was able to start with the other company through the app but was billed from this previous company the next month. \n\nIn addition, I was also signed up for a TV cable service without my consent - an additional $60 (which I didn’t realize for 2 months), because I was drowning in work and didnt check my account statement. When I realized this, I called up the company for a refund and told them about this entire episode- they refused to believe me and refund me. \n\nNow if you’ve ever called up any customer care recently, you know they monitor the call logs for ‘quality assurance’. I told the representative to go ahead and check their call logs. After around 40min of waiting, they confirmed that the date of the TV service started the same day as my call with the A-hole in October. They assured me that what the A-hole did is a serious offence and this will lead to him being fired from the company. I then enjoyed some delicious Indian food from the $60 refund. Small win for me, hopefully a big lesson for him.",

        "text": "I worked part time at a hotel while studying. The summer was always a pain in the ass as the regular low key business folks was replaced with stressed out families. A lot of the times the moms would make a stink in the reception area. \n\nOur rooms are small but can fit 6 people max, but really tight, almost crammed. \n\nThis one time this mother, the mother of all Karens came with her family of five. She was angry from the moment she walked into the reception. When she finally got her turn to check in(all checkins came at the same time so there was a line) she was annoyed and irritated even though I did my best to welcome them and greet them friendly.\n\nThey got their key and went to their room. Ten minutes later she came back and skipped ahead of the rest of the queue to complain about their room which she said was way too small for five people(even though it had five beds). Her entire family came down. She harassed me for about five minutes even after I politely explained to her that there were no more rooms.\nFinally I caved and said \"look, we're not supposed to do this but if you want I can give you the money for the rooms cash, and you can find another hotel room.\".\nFinally a smile from this bitch. I refunded her with cash from the register and she went on their way. They had not used anything in the room so I marked the room as available.\n\nTen minutes later another family reserved the room. \n\nAbout thirty minutes after Karen left, they came back. She was even more stressed. \n\"There are no hotel rooms available in the entire town! We have no choice but to take your room\" she said. \"Oh, I'm sorry I just sold the room\" I told her. \"But I'd be happy to find you a hotel room in X or Y,(neighboring cities both 40-45 minutes away).\"\n\nThis really set her off. \"We're going to the zoo!(local attraction, very popular), driving 45 minutes each way is going to ruin our entire day!\". \n\n\"I know, you told me. but to be fair, you did have a room here. It's always like this during the summer. All hotels are booked solid.\"\n\n\"So you knew this?\" She was so angry she was almost spitting\n\n\"Yeah, of course there could be cancellations at some hotels. But it is not likely during the summer. But hey, enjoy the zoo and your new hotel!\" I triumphantly said. \n\nShe stomped off, and her husband gave her the angriest look I've ever seen. He looked so pissed at her for complaining. \n\nTL;DR: worked at a hotel, angry mother complained. Gave her cash back and sent her family looking for other rooms even though I knew all hotels were booked and would have to drive a long way to/from the zoo, effectively ruining their holiday.",

        "text": "This happened back in 2015 after buying my first home. The property had been neglected and overgrown with ivy, blackberries, and other weeds on over an acre. I bought 3 goats and it took them about 4 months to clear everything. They were big, hungry girls and one of them got a taste for my neighbor's new raspberry plants. She had just planted some raspberry starts and my goat ate the leaves off. We felt really bad and let our neighbors know we would be getting rid of them and had posted an add on Craigslist and that we would replace the starts. We tried tying the goat up, penning her, etc but she'd always escape and go for the raspberry leaves.\n\nIt all blew up when on Easter morning their adult daughter came over and started screaming at us and threatening us, insulting us, letting us know they had a gun and would shoot it. My husband told them to get off of our property or he would call the cops. Our neighbor proceeded to run off and cry. She started throwing the plants over the fence, all but one of the six were ok and could be regrown. These were small 1-2 ft starts. \n\nThe next few days I had a buyer for the goats. Thr day after they were gone I got a notice from the county about the goats. I talked to my other neighbors and they informed me they love calling the county on everyone. I thought two could play that game. \n\nThey had their chicken coop against our shared fence which is illegal where I lived. It has to be a certain distance from a neighbor's property. They also didn't believe in garbage service, said it was a ripoff, and dumped their trash around their property and against the fence. \n\nWe called the county and they ended up doing an entire walk through of our neighbor's property. They had to move their chicken coop and remove all of the garbage. One of their kids made a comment about needing to find another place to dump their garbage. They had to build a new coop as the other couldn't be moved. \n\nI'd love to say that's where it ended but it ended up being a 5 year war about many things until they put their house up for sale. Right when theirs went under contract we put ours on the market, we were already planning to move and so ended the war.",

It was a lot of work and took me about 4 hours shoveling by hand to make a clear path. I made sure to dig out the nice neighbors cars and clear a path for them as well, but I left the neighbors who dont wave at me snowed in. I didnt pile snow behind their cars or anything, but just left it how it was about 2 feet deep.\n\nThis morning I got up at 6 and easily got in my car and out the driveway. As I was pulling out, the front neighbor was snow blowing the snow out of the behind their cars.\n\nAs I passed by using the nice clear path I had carved for myself the day before… he waved! \nToo late sir, too late.",

Also frequently visiting was the store manager's boss, the district manager.\n\nWhen colleague and I started, store manager told us almost word-for-word \"I was the top salesman in the company. That's how I got promoted to management. I get to sit back and relax now because it's your turn to do all the work.\"\n\nAnd true to his word, store manager slacked off and let us do all the work. We served the customers, managed the inventory and even did all the paperwork and banking for him. While he kept turning up, he would spend his day roaming the shopping centre, sitting at the coffee shop, flirting with female employees in other stores or playing games at the arcade game centre.\n\nTo make matters worse, store manager would \"borrow\" brand new mobile phones from the stock and \"borrow\" money from the till for his own personal use.\n\nColleague and I were unimpressed of course and after deciding we'd had enough of his crap, we decided to help him with his own downfall.\n\n1. We stopped tidying up after him. As long as they weren't in our way, we didn't touch his leftover food and drinks.\n2. Every time he disappeared, we tidied and reorganised the store a little.\n3. We were brutally honest whenever the district manager visited:\n\n* **DM:** \"Where's store manager?\" **Us:** \"He's at the arcade game centre sir!\" \"He's chatting to the girls upstairs sir!\"\n* **DM:** \"Why is this mobile phone box empty?\" **Us:** \"Store manager said he was borrowing the phone sir!\"\n\nWithin a couple of months, the store had been completely reorganised. Store manager had no idea where anything was located any more. He missed all the memos from head office and didn't know about new products or procedures. He also had to dispose of mouldy plates and cups on quite a few occasions. Colleague and I were running the store more efficiently than ever, and store manager was completely redundant by that stage.\n\nDistrict manager had figured out what was going on and had probably begun the process of having store manager terminated (there were procedures to follow so this would take a while).\n\nThen one day, store manager turned up to work early (surprising!) and told us that he had resigned. He probably figured that he was about to be fired, and preferred to leave on his own terms. District manager arrived soon after to give store manager an exit interview at his favourite coffee shop.\n\nColleague and I wasted no time to prepare the final insult. Before the exit interview was even finished, we had already packed all of store manager's personal belongings into a box, ready for him to pick up and leave.\n\nBye store manager!",

        "text": "Honestly this might not qualify as the outcome, while deeply satisfying, was not arranged or intentional -- also I apologize about the length.\n\nThis summer I moved onto the property in a cabin above a shop of a friend and his older, retired parents. I was offered the spot for the summer and told multiple times I could stay until November when I first moved in by all three primary parties (mother, father, son/friend). This was in exchange for working for my friends dad to help him get caught up in a work project he was very far behind in. Over a month I successfully helped him catch up, cleaned the attic above the cabin, and moved into the space.\n\nI'd hadn't even finished moving in yet before the mother started asking me about moving out. I immediately started to feel uncomfortable/unwanted -- over the next couple of months everyone involved started talking about my moving out and I increasingly withdrew, both because I hate passive-aggressive communication and because why would I want to be around people who don't want me to be there?\n\nI tried to pay rent but the father refused to take it because of the rules of the community they lived in; instead he wanted me to help around the house with various projects. I agreed but not even two weeks later my actual job ramped up and suddenly I was working 2x as much as a few hours later. By time I was falling asleep after-work it was maybe a few hours before they'd be waking up. Between the gym (Which was an hour away), hygiene and work I had very little freetime, and the freetime I did have I was too burned out to do anything.\n\nOver the course of the Summer my relationship with the father broke down and he no longer wanted me in the main house, forcing me to buy a fridge &amp; induction stove for the cabin. In the end, I actually preferred it (As again I was uncomfortable being around them and honestly stopped liking the parents at all by August), but this was relayed to me completely through his son, as was all future communication between myself and his parents. At the beginning of September I was let go from my job; this wasn't a big deal as I had one lined up for December and I had a place to go by November. \n\nTwo weeks after losing my job the son relayed to me that his parents were giving me two weeks to get out because his parents needed the attic for storage due to approaching winter weather, so about a full month earlier than planned. He started to offer a list of local homeless shelters, at which point I cut him off and told him not to worry about my moving out and that I didn't want anymore of their 'help'. \n\nThis timing was exceedingly inconvenient as not only had all my preparations to move been for the end of October but the fastest route to where I was moving was closed by a forest fire, turning a 3 hour roundtrip into a 7 hour roundtrip. I waited a week to see if the route would reopen but unfortunately it did not, and I didn't want to be there anymore, so I began my move in earnest.\n\nI made four trips back and forth in a 72 hour period, taking powernaps in store parking lots. At one point I was stuck in traffic due to an accident at 3am with a very depressed and worried cat riding shotgun with me while I struggled to stay awake. That took two hours of stop-and-go to get through and was peak misery.\n\nI managed to find someone who would let me borrow a truck to get my refrigerator and whatever furniture I could take but because of the short notice I would only be able to use it for that one singular trip, forcing me to play furniture triage and packrat Tetris. I ended up having to leave behind my couch and mattress. I left in the middle of the night after taking a quick last nap on my couch and I thought that would be the last I saw of those people.\n\nUnfortunately I forgot to change shipping addresses for my new bedframe and mattress so a week later I had to come and pick them up. I saw the son/ex-friend and he passive-aggressively says \"Sooooo your stuff in the attic?\" and I said, while still loading my car \"what about it?\" to which he says \"Are you going to get your couch and mattress?\". I told him I didn't have anywhere to put them nor the means of driving them over the mountains. He looked at the ground and nodded in what I could only interpret as frustration, and I got in my car and had the biggest fucking smile on my face the whole drive home.\n\n**tl;dr** \\- people I lived with kicked me out a month earlier than they said they would, causing me massive inconvenience and some genuine misery. Since they kicked me out earlier than they said they would, I was unable to get all of my shit out of their attic I'd been living in that they wanted to use for storage, leaving them with a heavy couch and mattress to either struggle with removing or take up space they wanted to use.",

Absolutely loved it, and the teachers there were awesome and very caring.\n\nThat program had a service where if you were late, they'd have a little after school program for the kids staying late and just charge whatever parents came late a fee. Another great service that we rarely used.\n\nOne day I did have to use their late program, as I had to stay a little late after work. Picked up my kids, thanked the teachers, and left.\n\nThe next day I came in to an extremely rude note from the principal about paying the late fee. The note was derogatory, made accusations, and at the end of it threatened to call CPS and report me for child abandonment if I didn't pay immediately. All this over a $20 late fee that wasn't due until the end of the week.\n\nI bring it up with my kid's teacher and she apologizes, said the principal had been doing this to various parents, and while she had heard there were parents not paying the fee at times, the principal was taking it out on everyone.\n\nSo to my petty revenge. Not only was this note rude, it was written extremely poorly. Especially for anyone in education. \"Then\" in the place of \"Than\", missing punctuation, improper capitalization, the works.\n\nSo I asked the teacher for a red pen, and sat there grading the paper. By the time I finished that paper had enough red on it that it looked like a girl scout who just short changed Chris Brown. Then I took a picture of it, hung it on the bulletin board in the entry to the school, and posted it on the school's social media page, and fired it off in emailed to every administrator I could find. \n\nIt stayed up on the bulletin for days. It wasn't until during my conference call with her and her boss that she realized it was there, as I was mentioning how embarrassing that letter was and all the places I had shared it. I never saw it again after that.",

        "text": "I'm a 20 year old Female who lives in a suburban neighborhood with my family. A few years ago, we had new neighbors move in next door. At first they seemed okay, but then they turned out to be complete party animals. I'm talking partying three times a week, blasting LOUD music till 2am.\n\nOver the past year and a half, we've had multiple confrontations with our neighbors over petty stuff. In fact, I made a post about one of these petty confrontations with our neighbor on r/MaliciousCompliance. Here is the link if ya'll want some backstory, but it's not necessary: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/mgu6tu/move\\_your\\_car\\_lol\\_ok/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/mgu6tu/move_your_car_lol_ok/)\n\nI'm shocked it blew up as much as it did. And honestly? I almost forgot about the post entirely, until a few weeks ago.\n\nHere's the story:\n\nOur neighbors were having another one of their super crazy pool parties and it was driving everyone in the neighborhood crazy. The police couldn't do much, because we would make a noise complaint and the police would show up to give them a warning. Things would get quiet for maybe 30 min, but then the partying would start again. Overtime, some neighbors began to give up and eventually some even moved away. This was especially upsetting for my mom when one of her friends, who lived on the other side of our neighbor, moved away due to our horrible neighbor.\n\nMy mom had finally had enough. Once the party finally seemed to wind down at around midnight and guests started leaving, my mom marched straight up to the female owner of the house (we'll call her Lying Sally, because she's a pathological liar) and warned her that we will start calling the cops on them more often if they don't stop. Of course, Lying Sally and her party guests laugh and start taunting my mom, which led to an ugly screaming match. \n\nLuckily, I had the common sense to record all of this. Just in case. And thank god I did!\n\nAt some point during the fight, Lying Sally screams at my mom, \"I'M GOING TO F\\*CKING BEAT THE SH\\*T OUT OF YOU!\"\n\nOne of our neighbors called the cops, which I don't blame him for doing so. I was getting worried for my mom, since Lying Sally kept threatening to \"f\\*ck her up\". The cops came and everything got peacefully resolved.\n\nIt wasn't until the next morning I reviewed the video and remembered that you can file a restraining order against somebody for \"threat of assault\". Now here's the thing. I knew that filing a restraining order against someone can cause that person to maybe lose their job or make it very difficult for that person to find a future job. I knew from the sticker on the back of her car that she works in a daycare. If I were a nicer person, I could've let it go. \n\nToo bad I'm petty. \n\nSo we filed the restraining order, took my neighbor to court, and after showing the judge the video he was immediately on our side. Especially after she had initially tried to lie and claim that she never once threatened my mom. She didn't know I had video proof!\n\nThe judge granted us the restraining order and we were jumping for joy. Meanwhile, Lying Sally wouldn't stop crying and pleading with the judge to re-think his verdict. \n\nThe real kicker? I made an anonymous call (with a friend's phone) to the daycare center where she worked and let her boss know EVERYTHING. A few days later I noticed that she had removed the sticker on the back of her car. I'm pretty sure she was fired, because she started staying at home almost 24/7. Her car almost never left the driveway.\n\nAlso, the best part? The crazy loud parties finally stopped. It's been radio silent for a whole month. \n\nYou can bet that during Christmas our closest neighbors dropped off a lot of cookie tins and chocolates as thanks.",

I picked out a boatload of snacks and when I got home my sister came running to see if my mom bought any snacks she infact did not and her disappointed face truly made me smile. So I started taking out all my snacks throwing them on my bed so when she left the kitchen she can see them on my bed and went back out to get my drinks too after that I organized them on my windowsill painfully slow and then start munching and crunching rather loudly. Even humming say how good this is and then she fell in my bait she asked for some popcorn and I said... No it felt so good I'm still Rolling around in my bed giggling.",

        "text": "So this happened a few months ago. I am driving in a city in the Eastern Europe (not going to specify the country). I am on a pretty wide road, on the middle lane and few cars. A pedestrian comes to a crossing, but I did not stop, because I was about 2 meters from the crossing when they started crossing, and as I said, I was 2 lanes away from the side of the road. A hundred meters later, an unmarked police car stops me. The officer comes to my car, tells me why he stopped me: because I did not yield for the pedestrian. I told them that I was already too close to the crossing to stop, and really did not interfere with the pedestrian. After a few minutes of arguing on the topic, the officer agrees and says something along the lines: “yea, maybe you are right, but now that I stopped you, I still need to write a fine, so I will make it the smallest one. I will give you a fine for illegal parking”. That angered me so much, but I said okay just do it faster. I thought it is not worth to argue too long for a small fine. I go to their car, he starts writing the papers, and outside the car tells me “but if you show me your car documents, and they are alright, I will let you go”, while also making the universal “give me money 🫰” sign with his hand. Now I tell him to write the fine. After he has written the fine, i ask him to go with me to my car and tell him: “You see this dashcam? It has recorded the pedestrian and whether I was guilty for not stopping. But you gave me a fine for illegal parking. How do you think this fits together?” He had a very shoched face. I call my best friend and tell him “Good day mr general, we have a situation here”. Obviously he is not a general, but he got it and played along. I tell him we have two officers that asked for a bribe, can you send in two guys from the anti-corruption department? He loudly responds, yes of course, where? I give him the address, and he says they will be here in 15 min. The police officer was afraid for his life. He started begging me to let him go, and started apologizing. He immediately ripped up the fine, and put it in his pocket. I jokingly said: “No no, now you need to show me your car documents” and showed him the universal give me money sign 🫰. He genuinely believed me and started looking for his wallet. I stop him and tell him that I was joking. I told him that I am in a rush and don’t have 15 minutes to wait for the anti-corruption guys, but if they ever stop me again, I will definitely wait. Since then I got military salute from two patrol cars while I was driving.",

        "text": "So as my title states I was 16, and visiting my supposed best friend. This girl had been in my life since we were 11, she pulled me out of addiction and other issues due to some childhood trauma when I was thirteen ish; and I was there for her when her heart gave out due to coke.This is all I will say on that bit of the story we were some really messed up teenagers. At fifteen she moved two states over and this visit after my sixteenth birthday was the first time I’d be seeing her since the move. Our parents didn’t get along so it took a lot of convincing on both our ends to finally get to see each other. But we were both ecstatic and happy for the almost two week visit at least I thought.\n\nNow jump back in time a bit I have a male best friend we’ve known and been thick as thieves ig you could say since second grade… but when I turned fifteen my mom and dad split for awhile and mom basically kidnapped me to come and live with her at an aunts house. So while I’m living there this friend is messaging me and checking up one thing lead to another we started talking about more than just friendly things and he’s the first person I ever sent *special* pictures to. Yes I am aware of my age again I was a messef up kid. Anyway my girl bestie over in her state is getting all the juicy details etc and encouraging me to pursue it further as he has supposedly told her that he likes me.\n\nSome information on me I’m not monogamous never was really my thing but if someone I’m with wishes to be then I am… he never said we were I never cared much about it. He said while we were having our talks etc in passing that he was messaging my girl bestie too again didn’t think twice on it because this came up when i mentioned i was talking to both him and her. \n\nBack to the visit; she wants to read our messages and he knew i told her everything so i knew he wouldn’t mind I let her read through them and she begins  to act weird and nervous saying he was lying about her and him messaging that he sent her some pics and she told him to stop because she wanted him with me or some bs thing like that. Again if they had been talking more inappropriately this girl should’ve known me as I am i would give two shits. \nWell anyway her reaction to the messages and how she worded her response I knew she was lying and was kind of ticked off because I’m a very open person but I truly hate lies. I don’t care if the truth is insane don’t ever lie to me. So as per usual with me and my bestie we both had each other’s phone passwords and i knew she kept her messenger logged in and so I logged into it and went to their messages finding that he indeed had been honest with me in that message he was sending things back n forth with both of us and I then proceeded to screenshot and send the spiciest of their messages to myself and delete the messages from her side so she wouldn’t know (keep in mind this was 2016 messenger) \nAfter I returned home I sent these screenshots along with an admittedly mostly fabricated story about how she sent all of it to me and blah blah to the male bestie. Along with a request not to tell her I sent it. He promised he wouldn’t and in fact blocked her and then she messaged me upset about it and ofc “I was there for her” and then to add an unexpected result his mom apparently saw my messages to him. I suppose from her response to me she knew he was messaging me but wasn’t supposed to even be talking to my girl bestie not clear on why that was. \nMe and him continued as we were for awhile until some stupid drama went down and my girl bestie never knew better and no I never felt sorry don’t lie",

        "text": "Recently joined and wanted to post my only instance of petty revenge I have ever done. \nSo in college sophomore year I lived in an apartment style dorm where there was a living room/kitchen and 4 bedrooms 2 bathrooms. My childhood best friend was the roommate on my side. We were all on the soccer team so the two guys on the other side were from elsewhere (one from London one from another state) Generally got along with the guy from London and even friends to this day.  \n\nLong story short the guy from Michigan was the worst possible roommate I had ever had.  He would leave bags of trash around the dorm expecting others to take them out, use cook wear that wasn’t his and absolutely ruin it. Mostly by cooking dishes and using knives or forks to stir, with the POINT DOWN ON THE METAL.  He moved his tv to the living room and would listen on volume 100 while FaceTiming people and yelling over the tv volume. I usually cleaned the dorm as I am somewhat ocd and don’t mind cleaning up after others. However he ruined probably 100$ worth of cookware and had bugs in our dorm by the time I would get home from a weekend at home. I had many calm conservations with him on all of this and he would every time get angry and do nothing different. \n\n\nOnto my revenge. I typically was not the go out clubbing type as I was dealing with injuries to my knee as well as difficult college classes. One night when they went out to a club I saw he left his keys in his dorm room and knew they would come back wasted. I locked his door from the inside and closed it (knowing he would think he closed it). I then went to bed at a cool 9 pm and opened the windows on a relatively chilly night. Amazingly, this dude managed to bring a girl back to the dorm on this specific night for the first time. He couldn’t get into his room and couldn’t call an RA because it’s a dry campus and he was absolutely wasted. I hear him ask the girl to stay on the couch and she quickly leaves. He has no choice but to sleep on the couch in our 62 degree dorm room (I made sure he had his tv though!) and he drank enough to even get sick. He threw up on the couch (the one ONLY he uses) and had to sleep out there. The next morning I went to the head of living and asked to move to another dorm due to this, and she sent an RA to look at the room. The RA saw him and approved my request.  I would still go back to hang with my buddy at times and I swear a month later you had to wade through garbage bags.",

        "text": "I’m so proud of my daughter for this. Long story though…sorry.\n\nMy daughter 19F had a group of high school friends for years, fast forward freshman year college and her new roommate becomes part of the friend group. \n\nI was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer the same day she started classes that year. And as the year goes on her relationship with some of these friends starts to have problems but the roommate still seems solid so they sign a lease for sophomore year.\n\nBy the beginning of sophomore year all of her high school friends (4) have turned on my daughter and she’s struggling to figure out why. By the end of September she finds out the roommate has been playing both sides of the fence and has ultimately “sided” with my daughter’s old friends and continues to see them regularly.\n\nThis of course creates a nasty living situation for my daughter but she does her best to manage through. As time goes on I come to find out that her friends turned on her because they felt that her emotional needs were “toxic” for them to be around. My daughter was having panic attacks about my cancer and other normal things and was reaching out to her friends for someone to talk to and they couldn’t handle it. \n\nA few weeks ago the roommate invited 2 of these friends to stay over. My daughter asked that they pick another time as she had work and then an all nighter ahead of her finishing her finals and she didn’t want to be in the apartment if they were going to be. The roommate ignored this request. My daughter walked into them being there and had a panic attack. The roommate looked and her and said “see, this is why you have no friends when you behave like this. What do you expect?”\n\nThis week my daughter managed to find a way to move out before the roommate came back from break. The couch, the coffee table, the rug, the pots and pan, the dishes, the shower curtain, on and on…all of it was my daughters. The internet, the electric, the water all in my daughters name. \n\nShe took everything, moved out and left the roommate to come back from break with none of it working and all of the shared space items gone. And left her a note signed “what did you expect”. \n\nOh I wish I could be a fly on the wall when she walks in.",

So this older guy started singing loud enough to be picked up by the phone mic but not so loud as to ruin our enjoyment of the gig.

        "text": "I worked for a time at a school. This is a story from that time. I'm not a good person; but then, you wouldn't be reading this story if I were. \n\nNecessary background is that in the program I was working at (an afterschool affair) there were two level of employees; you were either a lead or an assistant. I was hired as an assistant at the middle school level. The lead never showed, so for the first three weeks of school, I made do. Then they announced they'd be hiring a new lead at that level. \n\nLong story short, I got a minor raise, and was left alone at the middle school. I was earning more than the assistants, but less than any of the leads. So I decided I would teach the middle schoolers properly. This is where knife safety entered in. \n\nWe were a private school, and snack was part of the after school program. The adults were supposed to cut the fruit/cheese/bread etc. unless we were sure the students could handle it. So I gave the students a lecture on knife safety. This is, more or less verbatim, the lecture (which I called the knife lecture, and gave a few times): \n\nThe first rule of knife fighting is: don't. The winner of the knife fight dies in the ambulance, the loser dies in the alleyway. The second rule is this: if you need to be in a knife fight, then the fight should be over before the other person realizes they're in a knife fight. The ways to do this are thus: first are the carotid artery and jugular vein; they are here (at this point demonstrate on your own neck where they lay, use a finger). The other easy option is the femoral artery, on the inner thigh (again, indicate with a finger). If you have to approach from the front, you cannot stab through the ribs. You need an upward angle, slightly to the left of the sternum. Go in through the stomach, angled at least 60 degrees, you'll hit a lung at least, and maybe the heart. \n\nThere was sometimes more, but I rarely made it through that much. I figured if I was going to be in charge of these kid's education, they would learn something worthwhile. I also taught them how to build IEDs, but that was another day. \n\nAs an aside, if any of you bastards recognize me (this is not a common lecture) message me my nickname from the class; who knows, I may get back to you.",

        "text": "Live across the street from a small high school, obvious residential area. They're doing some construction, and one morning I heard voices literally outside, up against my wall. I called sheriff's, as I was home alone in the morning. Mind you, it takes effort to walk all the way across the street to my yard. Come to find out construction the construction worker was laying against my house, using my ac unit as a table.  He \"thought no one was home\" and the sheriff told him to leave. A few months later I noticed another gentleman sleeping against my brick wall and in the leaves.  Again, this is a quiet residential area. He was very punctual, at 12 - 1 for a few days straight. I finally put my BLINK camera on the wall, so I could call the sheriff's right when he layed down. Low and behold, the sheriff's came about 10 minutes later, IDd him and made him get up and leave. He didn't look too pleased, and I found it so gratifying. There are plenty of other places to lay down and nap that don't involve my backyard.",
