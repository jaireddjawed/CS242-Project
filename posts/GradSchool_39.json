I had a very good relationship with the professor during my undergrad, and she enthusiastically told me she’d write the letter for me when I asked back in September. I’ve sent her two reminder emails, both of which she hasn’t responded to. I’m starting to get pretty worried about whether or not she’ll submit the letter in time for the deadline (most of the applications I’m submitting are due December 15th). \n\nThe other two professors I’ve asked have submitted their letters, and did so within a couple weeks of my request. The problem is that some of the programs I’m applying to require three letters of recommendation—on top of the fact that this professor knows my work the best out of the three. Is there anything I can do besides bother her more? Should I wait it out, and have faith that she’ll end up submitting the letter for me? I recognize that the Fall semester is in its last couple of days at my alma mater, but this is cutting it pretty close for me.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

Did it correlate to the outcome at all?\n\nPersonally, I didn't publish during my PhD, which is the norm for my field (most articles are submitted shortly after the PhD is conferred and most of my friends in my program haven't published). Other than that, I've been a \"good\" student (4.0 in coursework, 2/3 of research milestones had perfect evaluation scores, won industry awards etc.). \n\nThat said, I'm a little worried that my supervisors may have been less critical of my research *because* of my external achievements. I feel like my supervisors have put trust in me with a bit of a \"she'll be right\" approach. However, I've had an challenging couple of years. I had an episode of severe depression during COVID where my sleep was majorly disrupted (frequent terrifying hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations), I had a difficult pregnancy and traumatic birth which was followed by clinically severe PPA and PPD, my child refused to eat anything and became FTT, a family member relapsed into abusive behaviour following life stress which resulted in us having to go no-contact based on professional advice, and I was in a major car crash which caused past trauma of surviving a mass killing to resurface.

        "text": "I will be graduating with my PhD (STEM field) within the next year, but am really struggling with what to do post-PhD. Generally speaking, most graduates in my field go into one of the big three: academia, industry, or government/military research.  \n\nFor all three options, I have very few contacts (not staying in my direct sub-field for research), so I will be cold-emailing and applying for positions, which I realize is not the best. \n\nI assumed that I would naturally lean toward one of these (or perhaps two) as I progressed... but that has not been the case. My resume and skillset (like most who graduate from an academic institution) are best suited for academia...very *very* much so. I have had a lot of success with grant writing (I brought in just over a million dollars in research funds and/or stipend coverage throughout my PhD), I have quite a lot of teaching experience, about 14 papers once I graduate (5 first author), and a few international presentations in my field. I'm not listing these things to brag, but just to highlight that I feel almost obligated to pursue academia.... which I know can be incredibly toxic. (I'm in a toxic lab now, hence the above). \n\nI'm also extremely burnt out, and I'm not sure if I have it in me to do a 3-5 years of a postdoc, then aggressively pursue tenure-track positions.... *hope* that I get one, and crawl through the arduous process of tenure review before I can *maybe* start to slow down a bit. \n\nI know two things for certain: (1) I do not want to be the kind of academic that works endlessly for years then fosters a toxic work environment because I am too salty and burnt out, (2) I do not want a position that has a heavy teaching load/is teaching-exclusive. If I *do* enter academia, I want to work to foster the development of a better work culture, promote work-life balance in research, and advocate for fair treatment and pay for graduate students, post-docs, and technicians. \n\nFor the other options, I am aware that government/military pay in my field can be *horrible* to start... for very competitive positions. (I come from a background with poverty and have experienced homelessness, so some amount of financial stability is a must for me.)  Industry seems to pay well... but I have heard that industry work is not as passion-driven as academic research... and you can be \"reassigned\" to new, more profitable projects at a moments notice. \n\nI love my field, the work that I do, and the people in it. I know I want to continue research, but am lost about resources, options, and the merits (or downsides) of each track. My PI has been absolutely no help, but will write any type of LoR I ask. (Or more realistically, I will write my own and my PI will edit/sign it). So, theres that at least! \n\nAny input on pros/cons of these options,  your personal experiences, and/or rants about academia/government/industry are welcome.",

I am one of three people on our lab's safety team.\n\nTonight in group meeting, our PI told us that our lab would be closed from the 23rd to the 3rd for winter break. I reminded him that our building's facility Team was shutting off all water in the building on the 12th for maintenance, so we should not be in the building on that day.\n\nMy PI snapped at me in front of everyone \"No, we will be here. No other group is taking the day off.\"\n\nI responded \"Right, but if there is no water in the building that means there are no functioning restrooms, and more importantly, none of the eye wash stations or emergency showers in our lab will be operational.\"\n\nTo which he said \"If you don't want to be here that day, then just take a vacation.\"\n\nI am at a loss. How do I convince this man that he is going to get someone injured for not wanting to lose a day of productivity?\n\nI sent him an email, again spelling out my concerns, as well as explaining that I feel he was unnecessarily disrespectful and combative to me. I told him that if he wants people to come in and work from their office, that might be fine. But if even a single person steps into the lab, it is an OSHA violation and he will be responsible.\n\nI'm trying to get a paper trail so I have some record of this (besides the 15 eye witnesses from group meeting), but honestly it just feels futile at this point.",

I also cannot get above a B in this class on any papers/essays--I've went through the writing center, applied all feedback  from him on later work, gotten praise from reviewers on the quality of my work...and still nothing higher than a B. I have a 4.0 (in my second year) and I anticipate losing that this semester. Bleh. I mean I appreciate/need/highly value good, constructive feedback but his only makes me feel...bad? dumb? The comment on my last paper made no sense (misspellings) since he didn't say what part my paper was even referring to.\n\nMy thesis is another issue. My advisor barely talks to me (with the exception of one time, I've always initiated contact) and every time we discuss my planned scope for my thesis its like he's hearing it for the first time or that I want to even do a thesis! Most recently I told him about my plans to research this upcoming semester because I'll be traveling for 1-2 months and he was fine with that plan since I was fine tuning my thesis and prepping for my proposal submission. After asking what the timeline should look like given my estimated grad time (3 years from now--its a 3-4 year program) and research semester he suddenly switched to say I needed to turn in a proposal asap AND a first chapter draft and he totally ignored all previous conversations we had about my credits (asking again how many I have...). The way he worded it (and my husband agrees) came off as trying to dissuade me from pursuing a thesis--he's never even asked what I've done research wise, even though I've proposed us reviewing it in depth on several occasions.  Is this normal or a bad fit/absentee advisor?",

Much of what I have found has been data surrounding the use of these measures on very specific populations (ex: pre-surgical gastric bypass patients, etc.). The population my study surrounds is he lesbian, gay, and bisexual population, so using the aforementioned available data doesn’t seem appropriate. \n\nAny help or pointers to help me find literature on these measures’ psychometric/norming properties would be extremely helpful!",
