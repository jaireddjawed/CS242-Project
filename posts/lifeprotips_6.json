In this latter basin, I squirt some Dawn (since I think it's best, but idk) and fill the sink with hot water.\n\nOnce the basin is about 85% filled, I start washing the cleanest dishes by submerging them in the soapy water and scrubbing everything away with the sponge. Rinse over the basin with only dishes. Repeat.\n\nIf the soapy water starts to lose its \"soapiness\", I will either completely drain the basin or drain some of it and re-soap and re-add water to it.\n\nAll the while, the pots and pans with stuff still on them will have been sitting with once-hot water (and a squirt of soap, depending on how oily they are). Starting with the cleanest of them, I scrub/rinse over the empty basin, then move it to the watery basin and scrub until there's nothing left. Rinse again over the empty basin and repeat for other dishes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm primarily curious about a good soap+water ratio so that I'm not wasting neither soap nor water.

Basically everything.\n\nYou have no leverage to inflate your salary anymore, companies know *exactly* what your numbers are going in to the interview.\n\nIf you don't believe me, you can check it for yourself. Because this information is subject to the Fair Credit Report Act, you are allowed to request a free annual disclosure of your file from the The Work Number (or whatever other reporting agencies) that lists every single thing they know about you, and it is *shocking* how much employment data they have on you.\n\nIf anyone is is interested, you can get your disclosure straight from their website: https://theworknumber.com/resource/-/resource/request-form-employment-data-report",

        "text": "First, I'm talking about the car washes where you go through the tunnel, then use self service vacuums/ drying area.\n\nI've notice over the last 4 or 5 years that car washes are finally offering compressed air, but I hardly see anyone using it. Using the compressed air will cut your car wash times in half and provide you with a cleaner and drier car when done correctly.\n\n1. Get the basic wash. If your car needs wax, tire shine, water repellent, etc, do it yourself. The tunnel wash does not distinguish what part of your vehicle needs these products and sprays them everywhere. You don't want/need tire shine on your fenders and doors. They are also not using high quality products. \n2. Exterior: USE THE COMPRESSED AIR. Use it to dry the entire vehicle. Slightly pull the door handles out and get the pooled water out using it. Spray it under your windshield wipers, on your window seals, in your door thresholds, around the emblems, on the tires and wheels, and anywhere else where water might pool. The biggest problem with tunnel washes is that the vehicle doesn't get dry and the water blows out of small crevices and dirt gathers where water runs. \n3. Interior: USE THE COMPRESSED AIR. Pull your floor mats out and blow them with that sweet, sweet compressed air. I promise you, it will get rid of much more dirt and filth than the vacuum ever could. When the mats are removed, use the compressed air to gently blow any debris out of the floor, then vacuum anything remaining. Use the air to clean your door panels and even your dash. Use the vacuum to get anything remaining in the center console or whatever you can't get from the air. \n4. Clean your thresholds. You'd be surprised how much cleaner your car looks when the thresholds are clean. Most car washes I see nowadays actually provide microfiber towels (if not, see below). Grab one and wipe all of your door thresholds. It makes a huge difference that you never notice until you notice. Also gently use the compressed air to dry the weather strips while the doors are open. Then use a microfiber or shammy to clean any runs that the air may have caused. \n5. Finally, I keep a small kit in the back of my car with a few cleaning products, like a microfiber towel, tire shine and a shammy. I spray the tire shine immediately after getting out of the tunnel, the use the compressed air to dry it right before I leave (it throws a lot of sticky dirt onto the vehicle if it's not dry). A can of it is like $8, so why pay $2 more every time you go through a wash for them to spray it all over your car? Wipe down the interior with a clean microfiber and done.\n\nI have 2 versions of my car wash. One where I just go through the tunnel then dry the exterior. It takes about 5 mins. The second version is a full wash and it takes about 15. \n\nIt just drives me nuts seeing all these people using towels to dry their entire vehicle, then using vacuums to clean the interior when this way takes 1/3 of the time AND does a better job in all regards.",

I had the pleasure of working with Jonathon during his psychiatry rotation at \\[Name of Institution\\], and I can confidently say that he demonstrated outstanding performance throughout his time with us.\n\nJonathon consistently exhibited a strong work ethic and a dedication to providing the best care possible to his patients. He was always eager to learn and showed a genuine interest in the field of psychiatry. Jonathon was able to develop excellent rapport with his patients and was adept at building trusting relationships with them. He showed great empathy and understanding towards his patients, which allowed him to provide effective care.\n\nJonathon was also a valuable team member during his rotation. He was able to work collaboratively with his colleagues and was always willing to lend a helping hand when needed. He demonstrated excellent communication skills and was able to clearly convey his thoughts and ideas to his colleagues and patients alike.\n\nIn addition, Jonathon was able to effectively balance his clinical responsibilities with his academic commitments. He consistently demonstrated strong organizational skills and was able to manage his time effectively, ensuring that he was able to meet all of his responsibilities.\n\nOverall, I strongly recommend Jonathon for admission to your medical school. He has demonstrated a commitment to the field of medicine and has shown the qualities necessary to be a successful physician. I am confident that he will make a positive contribution to your medical school community and beyond.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\\[Your Name\\]\n\n\\[Title\\]\n\n\\[Institution Name\\]  \n\n\n  \nLooks as good as any letter I've ever seen.",

The bank decided this looked 'sus', so they put a hold on it until contacting us. This however, let Amazon INSTANTLY choose another payment method out of her account and charge the total to that - which happened to be our Debit account. \n\nThe big issue now is that while we have cancelled the order and will deal with the bank to be able to re-order on the correct VISA instead - we now took a $1k+ hit to our account as a 'pending charge', so we effectively are down that money. And... RV park rent is due to day. And truck insurance comes out today. So I'm now about to overdraft at least 2 times, because my bank thinks our CC was stolen, and Amazon wanted their money anyway. \n\nThis setting was NEVER manually enabled by EITHER of us on her account, or mine, where I found it also in effect. It's been disabled now, and Amazon support is telling me to go pound sand about all of it.

Now pay more to have laundry in my place.  That is a luxury I chose.  If I set that choice in stone and something happens where I have to save more money, I have constructed downsizing to some kind of tragedy or failure.  Similar to having many streaming subscriptions or buying expensive liquor.\n\nThe trap is where you look at it like you earned it, like it was handed to you, and removing it is then a failure.  Look at these things the other way instead.  These are luxuries you chose.  If you lost everything tomorrow but still had your health and sanity, you have enough to work with (I am sober 3 years, trust me).  Additionally, people are happier when they have one or two luxuries and always love them.  It's better than a whole array of luxuries you take for granted and cost you money.\n\nStripping away luxuries can feel freeing too.  Like you can rip out most everything but the essentials, and life still can work pretty good through creativity and more cash.",
