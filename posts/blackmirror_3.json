I also love the Britishness of BM, it feels the newer seasons are moving away from that. \n\nWhat do other people want to see in the new season?",

The second just kind of ends, so I didn’t find it totally satisfying. The third, I’ll admit I didn’t expect the kid to be the product of an affair, but as soon as I saw the snow globe I knew how the rest would go…until the very end with Matt being blocked by everyone and Joe having to endure like a million years of psychological torture. \n\nFirst of all, idk where they had Matt before but I can’t imagine being unable to interact with literally anyone is much better. Unless they were going to do to him what they did to Joe. I mean wtf. Dystopia is one thing, but that’s the most disproportionate punishment of the entire series by far. It just took me out of the illusion.\n\nOverall the acting was top notch, but the twists weren’t as shocking as in other episodes, and the ending fell kind of flat for me.",

We know several things.\n\n1) The hackers accessed Kenny’s computer through malware\n\n2) The hackers are constantly watching, so they are close by\n\n3) Kenny is part of a bigger plan in which he had to be nearby \n\n\nWith the CEO, it’s quite easy to find a small list of important people in the area and hack their email. With the man who was cheating (I’ve forgotten his name sorry) it’s easy to seduce him.\n\nHowever, with Kenny, so much had to conveniently work out. He needed to get a virus, he needed to live in the area, he need to independently make the choices that got him there (don’t think anyone needs reminding of what those were).\n\nHe only got the virus because of his sister… he wouldn’t have gotten it on his own accord. She would also have insider knowledge that Kenny is close by to the other people involved in the “game” so the hackers don’t have to filter out a thousand horny teens until they find one in that specific area of London. \n\nWhat do you guys think?",

Is this look solely because they like the fact that this is probably the highest percentage they’ve seen with someone, and that’s of course promising? Or are they smiling because maybe they have remnants of memories from the experience… and/or they’re maybe even shown videos of their simulations? They don’t fully explain the before and after of the whole experience.\n\nI know that I’m probably overthinking it, and it’s probably just that they already seemed attracted to each other and then saw the percentage and were happy, so they smiled. And maybe it’s just *my* experience with them the entire episode that makes the smile seem like a knowing smile, more than just a happy one. \n\nBut do you think there is more to it than just looking at the apps percentage? \n\nAlso finally is the couple at the couples gathering who are like “It works, so just be patient!” Are they some sort of simulated fake couple to keep people in the simulation and keep their hopes up? Or do they maybe ask real couples to re-enter the simulation to make announcements like that?\n\nI guess of all the techy things in Black Mirror, simulations raise the most questions for me. Unless the simulation actually is just their cookies, then I’d believe they of course have no recollection of the experience. And that the success couple is fake. It’s just that typically a simulation vs. cookies is shown as people being hooked up to a machine and then waking up and remembering the entire experience. But I know this Black Mirror so a simulation can be different things.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The tierlist](https://preview.redd.it/mo88nyu71i3a1.png?width=1140&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0def5f327da4f2ef5eb528bfa39d084f33e5c069)\n\nI just finished the last episode, and I have to say every episode is worth a watch.\n\nTo me, Black mirror is not a show about what could happen in the future. It's a show about what is going on **right now**, in present times. It is a \"black mirror\" reflecting who we are, and the choices we make, individually and collectively. There is no \"big bad evil corporation\", or \"bad and scary technology\", because ultimately we do this to ourselves. \n\nThe worlds depicted are just an extension of what's going on today. Think about 15MM : the cells surrounded by screens reflect our current lifestyle - we got television, phones, computers, you name it. We're surrounded by screens.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that makes this show great.\n\nNow some random comments on some episodes :\n\nMetalhead and Crocodile just didn't stick to this idea at all. And they were also quite boring to me honestly. They're still worth watching but meh. \n\nUSS Callister was a very good concept but it was poorly executed, with some really bad plotholes (you probably know about them at this point). Also the sociopath (I forgot his name) is just evil with no redeemable qualities, him literally murdering a kid over and over again was too much. Black mirror is best when it's more nuanced than that. Still one of the most memorable episodes tho.\n\nI like Smithereens a lot but the ending was SO LAME I can't put it higher.\n\nThe national anthem is top 3 for me. You know from the beginning he'll probably fuck the pig, but you still wish he gets saved somehow. And it's extremely relevant politically even right now. Remember this was aired in 2011! Social media wasn't even THAT impactful in that era. Now it's everywhere. Being a politician nowadays must be hell on earth.\n\nThe waldo moment is a similar idea. It was aired in 2013, before things got really crazy politically speaking IRL. And just like the national anthem, it is extremely relevant nowadays. \n\n15MM is the best imo because it sticks to the core idea of Black mirror, it's beautiful to watch and it's full of meaning. It's a take on capitalism, on how screens have invaded our life, on TV shows and specifically talent shows, on the massification of pornography, of the meaningless of a lot of professionnal careers (everyone runs a bike going nowhere), on how the system crushes beauty because we demand it (and we like it...), on how the system internalizes every critic and ultimately corrupts everything and everyone, etc.\n\nAnd I'm forgetting other things too. 15MM truly has it all. In that sense, Ashely Too is like the dollar store version of 15MM, because the ideas are similar. But in Ashley 2 at least we get a good ending.\n\nAnyways I'm tired of writing so that's it. I love this show",
