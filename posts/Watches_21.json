        "text": "I recently got this Timex Expedition Field Chronograph that I have been eyeing up for a long time (this particular beige color dial) and I have to say that this is now one of my favorite watches in the collection. It's just so versatile, goes with a lot of outfits and is extremely comfortable, perfect for everyday wear in my opinion. I am a bit concerned about the water resistance as it claims to be 100m water resistant, but only has a press on caseback. So just for the safety I changed the battery and lubricated the seals as well (maybe some of you have tried swimming with it?). Anyways, what's your best everyday watch?",

        "text": "I am trying to get some more information on this 1960s era Longines watch. It has a mechanical movement and the case is 10k gold filled. Unfortunately that's all the information I have.\n\nThe case back has no markings or serial number or any information I can use either. I am also wondering if this is even a legitimate Longines. The typically 'Swiss Made' lettering isn't on the face and it seems a bit clean for its age. Any advice on the reference, model or weather or not it is real would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your help!",
