        "text": "My name is Andrew and I’m a recent college graduate. I’m what people would call a top-A student. Everyone said I should’ve gone to medical school, but I always felt like blood and guts just weren’t my calling, so I chose to study history instead. Little did I know that what was waiting me in life was far more bloodier, and guttier, than any medical student would have to go through.\n\nSo I’m sure most of you guys know, because personally speaking, I was one of those people who didn’t know, that getting a job with a history degree is harder than getting a job without any degree. The only place that would ever email me back other than McDonald’s was a shoe factory that accidentally emailed me thinking I was someone else.\n\nStill, I didn’t let my spirits down, afterall, I *am* known to study my ass off. So I kept trying and trying and eventually, I landed a really sweet job at the local library cataloging some crazy old newspaper archives from New York city. So lucky for me, that’s finding a job done. But unlucky me, the library’s in downtown and the rents are IN-sane! So after apartment hunting for almost a month, I almost called it quits and started dialing McDonald’s until one bright, or I should say dark October day, when I spoke with an old friend about my apartment situation.\n\n“Sure!” My friend Michael said, “You can totally stay at the apartment. It’s a little old obviously but I’m sure it beats losing the job.” My friend Michael had no problem offering me the spare apartment his family had owned for generations, but never really used.   \n\nI knew the apartment was old but, frankly speaking I didn’t know it was *that* old. It was a four-story tall building and each floor had two apartment suites on opposite sides. Michael’s apartment was on the last floor. I was quite shocked that downtown New York still had such apartments. I mean don’t get me wrong, I was extremely happy that I found a place to live in, I just didn’t want the thing to collapse on me or something while I was sleeping, that’s all.\n\nWell eventually I moved in and immediately started cleaning the place up as best as I could. After a couple days of rearranging furniture and cleaning, I was totally exhausted but seriously excited. Finally, I had a house to settle down in, it was such a great feeling. Until that night, the night I finished cleaning my apartment.\n\nDuring the middle of the night while I was deep in sleep after all the hard work I did, I was forced awake by super loud knocking on my door. It wasn’t really knocking on my door as much as it felt like it was someone breaking down my door. Anyways, I jumped out of bed and checked the time, 2 freakin’ AM! So I thought okay maybe it’s just some confused drunk and he’s mistaken my house for his, so let’s just check through the eye hole to make sure there’s nothing shady going on. I was quite shocked to see what I saw: A bald old man with a bluish skin color. One of his eyes are completely white while the other eye is bulging out of his skull. As soon as I saw him, something strange happened. He covered the eye hole with his hand from the outside.\n\nI felt extremely uneasy but I didn’t waste anytime. I thought maybe he lives in the apartment in front of mine and he’s having a medical emergency. He *is* just an old man after all, creepy face asides. But as soon as I opened my door to see if everything was okay, he already reached his apartment, slamming the door on my face. “O.K,” I thought. “Well, there’s no way he almost broke my door down unless he had some kind of emergency. And at the same time, there’s no way I want him knocking at my door again at this ungodly hour.” So I went to knock on his door. I said, “Hello sir, is everything okay? You we’re knocking on my door. Do you need any help?”. There was no response.\n\nI returned to my apartment and I hear sounds in my kitchen. First, it sounded like pots and pans clanging, then as I got closer it sounded like someone in distress choking, as if they want to scream but their voice isn’t coming out. I could feel the hairs on my arm rise. I slowly approached my kitchen to see what on earth was going on and what I saw was absolutely horrific. I found a man slaughtered, laying dead in a pool of blood on my kitchen floor. Someone had slashed his neck open. I stood in my spot, looking at the horror in front of my eyes. It was as if I had no legs, I was completely unable to move. At that moment, I even forgot how to breathe. Then suddenly, the slaughtered man rose from the pool of blood, holding his slit neck with one hand while stretching out his other hand, rushing towards me.\n\nThe next thing I know is his hand is around my neck, holding me. From how unbelievable the situation is, I feel the whole thing happening as if its not me going through it, instead I’m just experiencing some unlucky person’s life. I was in absolute terror. His hand was frozen cold to the point that it felt like my neck started to frost. I closed my eyes and started praying for my life, calling on the names of every God from every religion I’ve ever heard of. When I opened my eyes, I found myself standing in the middle of my kitchen with the moonlight shining on me from the window. Everything in my kitchen was clean and organized, back to normal. It was as if nothing had happened and the body and blood just disappeared.\n\nImmediately I ran to my room, locking myself up and basically I curled up into a ball waiting the morning to arrive. It sucked a lot because it was also, coincidentally my first day at work. Dead person or not, there’s no way I could lose this job. I entered my office at the library extremely exhausted from going through the terror of last night. Thankfully, my boss was really understanding and she let me go home after giving me a tour of the library. To be honest, I preferred to just stay in my office rather than return to that place but after all I went through, I would’ve probably fell asleep even while standing from how exhausted I was. While going up the stairs, I ran into the same old man I saw yesterday. The only difference was that his skin color wasn’t blue this time, it was normal. I couldn’t help but ask him, “Excuse me, you were knocking on my door last night isn’t it?” He turned his head, looking at me from head to toe. Before I could say another word, he left to his apartment. I didn’t know what to make of the awkwardness because I was dead tired so I just headed straight for my apartment, threw myself onto my bed and slept.\n\nI wake up and find myself in my dark bedroom. The only light I have is the yellow glow of the street light outside and I hear water dripping from the bathroom sink. At first it drips slowly, then starts dripping faster and faster, until it sounded like there was a flood of water pouring out of my bathroom. I immediately fell out of my bed, trying to get up as fast as I could to see what was going on. I ran to the bathroom and turned on the lights. All of the taps were fully turned on and water poured out of them like they were broken fire hydrants. I see so much water coming out yet somehow the water is painting my sink and bath tub into a dark black color. I ran to turn off the sink and bath tub but my whole bathroom is already black so I just stood there, doubting reality. I felt like is this even real? Suddenly, in front of my eyes, a black shadow emerged in the hallway.\n\nAs fast as I could, I ran back to my bedroom, grabbed my metal baseball bat and shouted into the hall, “I don’t know who you are or what you want. But you chose the wrong house to mess with!” I heard my front door open and ran to it, only to see the *SAME* old man walk out of my apartment and enter his apartment. I went to his door and started banging on it, “HEY YOU! WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE TRYING TO BREAK IN AND ENTER MY HOME! I’M GOING TO CALL THE COPS!”. Not a single reply, absolute silence. I sense a strange, creepy feeling and the hairs on my neck all stand up. I back away from the door and I can see the shadow of his feet under the door. I quickly ran back to my apartment, locked the door fully, and escaped to the safety of my bedroom. I threw myself onto the bed, forced some headphones into my ears and tried my best to forget everything.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, the morning sun had risen and I had to go to work again. This time I thought, there’s no way I’m putting up with this any longer.” I called Michael and blamed him for giving me his haunted apartment. I told him, “What the heck man!? Are you playing a prank on me or what? Giving me that haunted apartment to live in. I’ve known you since childhood!”. And he interrupted me, “Woah woah woah, hold on a second there. What do you mean haunted? Bro, I’ve known you longer than my mother, why would I prank you? And by the way, what nonsense are you talking about? What do you mean haunted?” I said, “okay, look forget that. Does your neighbor own a copy of the key to my apartment?”. For a moment he was silent, then he replied, “Oh yeah. I forgot about that.” I jumped and said, “What do you mean forgot about it! That crazy old man tried to enter my apartment last night!”\n\n“Ah, Uncle Ed. He’s harmless! The poor guy, all of his sons either passed away or stopped visiting him decades ago and he’s pretty much been alone ever since. He can be weird sometimes but deep down he really has a good heart.” “Alright,” I told him, “but I wish you had told me earlier. Still it’s cool.” And I hung up the phone.\n\nI went to work and couldn’t help but think in the old man the whole day. I felt like, you know what. If I had no one else in the world, I would probably do some pretty weird behaviors too. I think he just needs a friend. I left work with a refreshed mind and a new goal, I’m going to befriend my neighbor. Every morning I woke up to go to work, I would knock on Uncle Ed’s door but he would never reply. I would even buy a pie for him and leave it at his door as a show of friendship, but he wouldn’t accept anything either.\n\nEventually, he did open the door one day. I told him, “Hello, I’m the new neighbour next door. Look, I’m sorry about the bad start we’ve had. I’m a friend of Michael and I know that earlier you wanted something from the apartment. Look if you need anything or just want to kill some time, I’m really here for it.” He slowly looked at me from head to toe, took a pause, then said, “I have some dinner prepared. Would you care to join me?”\n\nWell I accepted his invitation, and had dinner. It turns out that old people can cook up seriously delicious roast beef. From that night on, we would regularly have dinners together and the weird things in my apartment suddenly stopped happening. It was really a period of bliss I’d say. I snugged the weird experiences I had under the rug and said maybe I was just exhausted from overworking myself with all the cleaning and lack of sleep. Plus the stress of a new job. Like, come on, we’re only human. It makes sense for the brain to play tricks on us sometimes.\n\nWell Ed became somewhat of a dad figure for me and I even found out that he was a war veteran from the second world war. It was awesome for me since I spent most of my time as a history student studying world war 2 so our discussions were endless.\n\nOne night, I posted a picture of me and Ed on social media and captioned it, “To my new friend and neighbor who’s also the awesomest person I know, Uncle Ed.” I started preparing for bed because I had work the next day until my phone vibrated. I got a notification from instagram. It was Michael. He commented, “Where is Uncle Ed?” I immediately called Michael, “Hey man, I didn’t understand your comment. Uncle Ed’s right beside me in the picture.” Michael replied, “Dude, that person isn’t Uncle Ed. I’ve never seen him in my life. Look, I still have an old picture of Uncle Ed on my phone. I’ll send it to you now.” The blood in my veins froze. The man in the picture was the same man I saw slaughtered on my kitchen floor.\n\nI ran as fast as I could out of my bedroom towards the kitchen, but when I reached the hallway I stopped. There was a black trash bag in the middle of my hallway, and clearly it wasn’t me who left it there. When I opened the trash bag to see what’s inside, I found arms, and legs, and buried underneath it all, the real Uncle Ed’s severed head.\n\nI felt such a severe pain in my heart, as if a knife stabbed me right through my chest. “This is too much on me,” I said to myself as tears rolled down my cheeks. I went back to my room to call 911 and told them about the bag I found in my hallway. I sat on my bed crying uncontrollably. The tears were so unstoppable that I could hardly see. Finally the police arrived and I explained everything that happened to me from the first day I came to this apartment. I told them about how I found a man slaughtered in my kitchen and about how the neighbor next door tried entering my house and about the bathroom. I even showed them the picture of me and the neighbor that I posted on instagram. What they told me after shook my soul.\n\n“That man in the picture you just showed us, his name is Greg Maddison. He was a well-known professional killer for the mafia. He enjoyed his job a little too much though and started murdering innocent people for the sake of entertainment. Sick bastard he was. He was caught, tried, and executed four years ago son. How you got that picture is beyond my comprehension, but one thing you should know is, this used to be his apartment. His last victim before he was finally caught was Mr. Edison, his old neighbor.”\n\nI stood up right away and packed my most important belongings into my backpack, then I asked the police officer to drive me to the bus station. I’ve had enough, and there was no way I was staying there any longer. I sat on the bench, all alone at 3am waiting for the bus back to my parent’s house when my phone rang. I answered asking “Hello, who’s this?”.\n\nA voice replied,\n\n[“It’s Uncle Ed!”](https://youtu.be/Cpt1z7RGl98)",

        "text": "“So, James, we have a question for you.” The corporate representative stated. \n\n“Yes?” I replied, nervously sipping on my glass of water. \n\n“Well, our only available employee needs his shift covered tonight..”  My boss explained, sounding incredibly nervous.\n\n“Mhm.” I replied while nodding my head.\n\n*Why was I called into a tense  meeting just to get asked to cover someone's shift?*\n\n“Well, We are prepared to grant you $45.00 an hour to cover his graveyard shift.” The corporate representative explained.\n\nI nearly spat out my water.\n\n“I-I’m sorry. Did you say $45.00 an hour?” I asked with a nervous chuckle.\n\n“Yes, but it obviously comes with some downsides…” My boss stated, \n\n“Like what?” I asked.\n\n*The downsides must be pretty damn bad for them to do all this…*\n\n*“*Well, why don’t we just give you this paper and you can sign it if you want..” The corporate representative spoke before handing me a thick packet of paper with a pen. \n\nThe corporate representative and my boss left the room. I brought the packet closer to me and flipped through it to find out it was 232 pages in total. \n\nI flipped to the second page and was greeted with a list of rules.\n\n“1. Do not go into the Janitorial closet.\n\n2.  *Please,*  do not go into the Janitorial closet.\n\n3. Under absolutely *NO* circumstances are you to go into the Janitorial closet.\n\n4.*DO  NOT GO INTO THE JANITORIAL CLOSET.*\n\n*5.*The Janitorial closet is 100% OFF-LIMITS”\n\n“What.. the… fuck..”  I muttered. \n\n*Whatever, maybe they just have some sketchy shit they don’t want anybody seeing, it seems worth the money to me.*\n\nI picked up the pen and signed my name on the paper.\n\nI checked the time, it was 11;46 PM. After working at this shitty grocery store for years now, I was aware that the graveyard shift started in only 14 minutes. I was incredibly exhausted from the double I had just worked, but I very much needed the money. \n\nSuddenly, My boss opened the door and came inside. She walked over to the desk and picked up the paper. She examined it carefully, and then smiled.\n\n“Thank you! You made the right decision!” she stated in  a giddy tone.\n\n“Wait!” I shouted.\n\nShe stopped and turned around.\n\n“What’s up with the Janitorial closet?”   I asked.\n\n“I am not authorized to comment on that.” she stated before walking away. \n\nI got up and started my shift. I stood behind the register, bored out of my mind and isolated; I was the only employee working.  After an hour of total boredom, my mind began to wander.\n\n*What is in that closet?*\n\nMy mind desperately craved to know the answer.\n\n*Come on, get yourself together. Follow the ONLY rule they gave you.*\n\nBefore I knew it, I was headed in the direction of the closet, almost involuntarily. As I got closer to the closet, a strange and tantalizing humming sound began, becoming louder each step I took.  Upon reaching the closet, the humming had become incredibly loud, almost deafening, But I still couldn’t turn away. I stood and watched the closed door in awe as mysterious colors glowed and danced through the doors cracks, as if it were calling me.  \n\nEventually, the curiosity was too much to bear. I lifted up my arm and swung the door open at once, revealing the horrifying yet  tempting scene in front of me. It was a large ball, swirling and pulsating with life and colors. I reached out to touch it when the trap revealed itself. The ball began to swirl rapidly, turning into a slimy gray color. The  once mystical sound had now become horrifying and gut-wrenching.  Large tentacles shot out of the center, grabbing and pulling me into it. \n\nI screamed for help as I  was pulled through the ball, and out the other side, leading into the place of nightmares. I fell  to the ground with a *thud*.  I looked around, I was in an entirely gray wasteland, surrounded by menacing silhouettes.   Severe fear and paranoia washed over me in an instant. Looking around in a circle, I realized there was nowhere to run.  The silhouettes began to slowly and tauntingly make their way towards me.  Black lightning struck the ground near me,  and deafening thunder ensued. \n\nAs one of the silhouettes got closer, I realized I recognized the face. The face belonged to none other than my co-worker, Jerry,  who had been assigned the graveyard shift just last week. His face was now incredibly disfigured and uncanny. I didn’t believe he had any humanity left. Jerry belched out a roar and charged at me. I dodged the attack and was left breathless with fear.\n\nHe roared once more, and this time successfully charged me, knocking me onto the floor.  He bit my neck, and I instantly felt dazed. Immediately after, Jerry calmly got up and left, seeming sickeningly satisfied. \n\nI have been here for god knows how long. I didn’t know what else to do, so I sat down and started typing this. My phone is  still  connected to the store Wi-Fi somehow, although it unfortunately doesn’t have cellular service.  They don’t seem to want to hurt me anymore, they just want to watch. I looked at my phone camera  and saw the disfigurement start. I think the end is near for me.. I can slowly feel my humanity leaving me. \n\nI should have listened to the rules...",

        "text": "After a *very* long walk home last night, I was exhausted. It was well past midnight, so I decided to just go right to sleep. I refilled my cat’s automatic feeder, gave her some love and treats, and laid down to sleep. I tossed and turned for a long time, feeling a sense of unease. Feeling frustrated, I got up to make some tea to calm my nerves. Before I could even reach my bedroom door, I felt a burning pain in my chest, like someone was holding a flamethrower to my ribs. I fell to the floor, screaming, and blacked out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, I was in the shop, but everything was wrong. The walls were cracked, the floor was warped, and everything was covered in mold. All of the clothing and furniture was gone, and the shop was completely empty. Somehow, I was completely unaffected by this, and thought nothing of it. There was a sense of peace in the room, and everything it felt completely natural, even though there was a voice deep inside me screaming that something was wrong. I ignored it, and wandered around for a bit, before finding myself in the break room. I noticed the air vent was open, and climbed up inside with no hesitation. I felt a tinge of panic as I tried to squeeze my shoulders through, but the walls of the vent opened up, as if welcoming me. I relaxed, and crawled around, following different paths almost on instinct. It felt like hours passed, and at one point, I looked down a tunnel and saw Sam. I waved to him, and he simply glared at me and scurried away. The sight of him in the vent caused the voice in my head to scream that someone was wrong, and I began to realize what was truly happening. The walls began to melt away, but before the mirage was completely broken, I saw a vent to my right pop open, and I hopped down into a room lit with candles. This room seemed like a deep relief compared to the suffocating air vent, and I felt that false ease once again pushing the voice away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked at the space around me, squinting to find any indication of where I was, when a familiar face approached a candle, illuminating her. Meredith stood before me, the light reflecting off her eyes. They looked similar to Patrick and Daniel’s eyes when Corey was in their mind, but worse. There was no color to them at all, and I could see the dense fog swirling in almost hypnotizing patterns. When she spoke, her voice was crystal clear, but completely different than when she had spoken to me on the other side. It was strained, like she had been screaming for hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Why did you do this to me?” She asked, with no emotion at all. I felt dread soak into my bones, and suddenly I was hyperventilating, sweating, and the voice in my head changed it’s tone to try to calm me down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What did I do?” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Your stupid tricks trapped me in this world. I can no longer find peace. You will leave this place and never return. If you try to return-” her head twitched, and I saw the fog in her eyes moving erratically, “If you try to return, you will - you will be risking the lives of yourself and - and - and -”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was fully twitching, like a video stuck in a loop, and the darkness fell away and revealed the sea of souls. I looked around and saw nothing but the endless water. Suddenly, shapes began emerging. Growing closer, bodies were floating to the top of the water before standing up right and walking towards me. They were not menacing, but I felt an instinctual fear creeping up my spine. I turned back to Meredith, and saw Thomas rise from the water behind her. He put his hand on her shoulder and turned her to face him, before giving her a gentle kiss. She looked at him as he pulled away, and I saw the fog leave her eyes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Thomas?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello, love.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey embraced, tears streaming down their faces. I noticed the people rising from the water were getting closer, staring at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Meredith, Thomas, where am I? What is happening?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeredith wiped her tears and looked at me sadly. “Your soul was stolen from you, my dear. Taken to this place, being controlled. I believe our captor brought you here. I assume you have been attempting to help dear Eleanora, and she didn’t like that?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI nodded my head solemnly, feeling shame at my failure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“It’s alright, your time is not done yet. She is scared, I could feel it when she was inhabiting me. She knows you can stop this, and she is desperate to be rid of you. She knows she cannot trap you here, you are too strong, so she used me to frighten you.” She gave me a hug, and her embrace was warm and loving. “You cannot stay here. Your soul will be rejected and lost in the space between if you don’t return. Thomas knows the way back,” She turned to him and smiled lovingly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I will help you,” he said, giving me a stern look, “but you must be more careful. Cover your tracks. Convince this monster she has scared you enough, that you are giving up. As you now know, she can take control of you. You must not let her. Avoid her gaze and do not spend time alone with her. Stay with someone who is familiar to you, someone you know is safe, and keep each other that way. If she gets in your mind, she will know your tricks, and won’t hesitate to send you somewhere you cannot escape. Somewhere we cannot help you.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI paused, realizing where these souls came from. “The warehouse?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe nodded solemnly, and I felt a disruption in the sea of souls surrounding me, a collective wave of anger and grief washing over all of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You must be smart. You will not have another chance.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI nodded quickly, trying to seem confident. He turned to the sea of people standing before us, and said something I couldn’t hear. The people looked at me, and I finally noticed them fully. They were all mutilated to different extents. Some were missing limbs, others eyes, some were brutally burnt, others had large patches of skin completely missing. I held back a scream, and thankfully, Thomas didn’t seem to notice. They nodded at him, then me, and slowly fell backwards. They created a path, and Thomas walked across them, looking back at me, motioning for me to follow. I turned to Meredith one last time, and felt tears welling in my eyes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Thank you, and I’m sorry,” I sobbed. It was the only thing I could think of, and I hoped it was enough to let her know that I wouldn’t give up on her. She gave me a sad smile, and waved me off, before returning to the sea of souls. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI followed Thomas silently for what felt like an eternity. We did not speak, and I tried my best to not look at my feet or the people forming my bridge back to my world. They did not seem to mind, though, and part of me believed they couldn’t feel anything at all, but that thought didn’t stop the sound of my feet on their wet skin. Finally, we reached a small island. I stepped ashore, and saw my bedroom door, standing solitary on the island barely large enough to hold it. I turned to Thomas, hoping for an explanation, but he was already returning the way we came. I didn’t call to him. I wanted him to return to Meredith, I had a feeling they had been separated far too long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI approached the door cautiously, and looked all around it, figuring there would be nothing until I opened it. Hesitantly, I pulled the handle, and there I was, passed out on my bedroom floor, clutching my chest. I approached my body, looking at myself from above. I couldn’t help but think how sad and small I looked, but lost my train of thought when I noticed my cat staring at me. Not my physical body, but me, *my soul*. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Can you see me?” I whispered, and she chirped softly in response. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Great,* I thought, *so that’s why you stare at nothing all the time. Love that.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laid myself next to my body, and felt a pull as I lined myself up. I closed my eyes, and when I reopened them, I was back in my own skin. I looked around, gasping for air, and began sobbing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I worked at this shop, I wasn’t sure I even believed in souls. That quickly changed, obviously, but after having my soul ripped from my body and taken hostage, my entire perspective changed. I  knew it was something I needed to protect at all costs, and now I knew it was something that could be taken from me.  I suddenly understood why all the souls like in Eleanora’s world were willing to risk their existence to ask for help. They were still living, still could feel emotions, and were held hostage in a wasteland, just as I was moments before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a long cry, I collected myself and reached for my phone, planning on making a to-do list for my day off to recover. When I checked the time, though, it was 4 hours before my shift started. I was gone an entire day, almost 30 hours. I was so angry I didn’t notice the pain in my chest until I went to stand and fell suddenly, the burning making me scream. I crawled to the bathroom and pulled myself up to the mirror.

        "text": "  It was hard to tell at first about what I was doing to the world. I mean all the people that go missing around the world and suddenly your the cause? Well I know for certain that it was me cause I seen it happen personally. \n\n\n  On the days that followed this incident I was on the couch watching CNN. They were going on about a missing woman. \n\n\n  My 12 year old son Jack came to me and said, \"hey dad. You mind if I spend the week at Brad's for a while?\" I thought about and figured that since his grades were better than most of his class that i'd allow it. \n\n\n  \"Let me call Mr. Taylor and we will see if he will let you\". My son smiled at me with eyes filled with appreciation. \"Thank you dad!\" He then hugs me as I hug him back. As he goes upstairs to pack I yell at him to call his mother before he goes. My wife is at a business trip for a couple of weeks and I was able to get morning to evening shifts to take care of my son. \n\n\n  I call Mr. Taylor to let him know the news. He says that Brad will be thrilled to have Jack over. I give him our emergency contacts and see if Jack is ready to go. As I am walking down the bedrooms I hear him talking to his mother. I smile as I peek into their conversation as he says the usual love you and I know. \n\n\n  I ask him if he is ready as I come around the door and he shakes his head. \"Come on then\", he grabs his bags and we head out the door. As we go into our car I blink. Fun fact about me, I'm not much of a blinker, I won all the staring contest at school and when a new kid comes in we would make bets on how long they can last. \n\n\n  I dropped my son off at the Taylor's and went off to the IGA. I went and got all the tv dinners I need for this week. I went up to the number 5 checkout lane but I saw no one on number 3 but the light is still on. \n\n\n  As I am wondering where my cashier is I see a woman running up to the front and hollering at all the customers in the other lanes to go to 5. I ask the cashier since I was up front what happened to 3 and she looked at me with a worried look. \n\n\n  \"He went in to work today and I was pretty sure I saw him walk into the restroom, but when it was taking him a while in there our manger unlocked the employee bathroom he was gone!\" She looked at me with a worried expression. \n\n\n  \"Well I hope you all find him.\" I say to her trying to sound calm. She shakes her head yes at me as I went out the door. \n\n\n  That was weird. No one in IGA has never went up and gone at work. I know cause the manager always fired someone if he caught them trying to play hookey. \n\n\n  Whenever I went home all I did was play games on my phone and worked on my book. Later that night I cooked one of the many microwave dinners. When the timer beeped I blinked again. I didn't think that much of it but little did I know that, that blink caused a mother to disappear in a running car and her two children who got injured in a car crash.\n\n\n  Later that night a news story on it popped up on my phone where I am subscribed to a news magazine. It didn't help me sleep that night. Neither did the upcoming nights. \n\n\n  The next morning when I woke up I Blink like I always do. I would even have thought that day was one of the longest times where I didn't blink except that morning. On that day the top news story was that during a police escape a man vanished into then air. \n\n\n  I thought it was weird on how many disappearances there was that week. One time a preacher in Saudi Arabia went missing and the U.S thought that the Arabians were involved. The next day a journalists who police and agents were protecting wasn't in the safe house and they thought that assasins got her. \n\n\n  Another two was one child who was jumping into a rain puddle that the mother said that he was just \"gone\". Then there was that cheerleader who disappeared and the police suspected the bpyfriend for playing part.\n\n\n  Again I thought nothing of these disappearances that were happening around the world. I was just at home writing a book where a plane of passengers land in hell and try to overcome their personal demons to get out. \n\n\n  Every blink that I did a mysterious event happened around the world. The one thing about it though was that it was always one person instead of two or more. And it never happened to the same family. \n\n\n  During one day of that horrible day was the most times I blinked. A whole African villiage was discovered gone by the local population. I read this article with intrigue and mystery thinking another Roanoke had happened. \n\n\n  One dreadfull day however was the end of that week when my wife was supposed to come home. Me and my sone were waiting for her flight to get off when a police man came up to us. He told me that he wanted to talk to me privately and that my son could stay with his partner. \n\n\n  He told me the terrible and sad news that my wife had vanished from the flight. Her belongings were still there and they would give them to me as soon as possible. \"What am I going to tell my son?\" I asked him. \n\n\n  \"I don't know sir, but there will be a news story on it tonight\". He was right as I look at an upcoming barrage of news reporters. \n\nHe then looked at me sadly saying that i should take a week or so off work to be with my son. \n\n\n  So we left and I called my agent that I would be taking some time off my book. He said that he understood amd that he saw the news and wished me and my son well.  \n\n\n  It was a sad couple of days for me and my son but then we got over it cause we know that she would never want to see us mope around all day. \n\n\n  I then finished my book and it made us enough money where me and my son could go to Orlando in florida since he said he was to old for Disney Land. We laughed and enjoyed ourselves as we went into our hotel room. \n\n\n  That night we ate pizza and watched hotel television where a commercial for my book popped up. We cheered and my son asked if he could read my book when we got back home. We then turned in for the night not long before I blinked. \n\n\n  I woke up that morning and used the bathroom. When i came out I saw my son not in the bed. His covers were like they were when he would sleep at home. I then went out in the hallway and shouted for him.\n\n\n  I kept screaming his name until a officer went up to me. I told him my situation and he said that they will conduct a search. They searched the whole park and looked at the CCTV footage and told me they were unable to find my son. \n\n\n  By then after a few days of mourning all the news channels were branding me a murderer. I mean a man whose wife and son that both disappeared would sound sketchy. \n\n\n  By then I knew it was me who I had gotten rid of my son and wife. I knew it was me that caused all them people to go missing. That's why I'm writing my story. To get people to know my side before I pulled the trigger. Who knows. Whenever I hear the click of the gun my last blink will bring back all them people. To the families involved in all of this I'm sorry I took your loved ones. ",

        "text": "I've never believed in the supernatural until now.\n\nA little over a month ago I moved into a new house in northern California, it wasn't huge but it was big enough for me and our two dogs. I got the house for pretty cheap considering the condition, which honestly made me wonder what could be wrong with it. \n\nThe first week in the house was completely normal. Every so often I would hear weird noises coming from my bedroom, but I simply amused it was the one of the dogs. \n\nThe second week was when things started to get strange. I could almost feel a sense of dread whenever I was in the house. It made me uneasy most of the time. I started seeing shadows and figures out of the corner of my eye, but they were gone as soon as I looked over. One night as I was falling asleep, I woke to the sound of gurgling. I opened my eyes to see a pair of eyes directly across from my bed. It was the source of the sound. I shut my eyes faster than they opened and prayed that whatever it was, that… thing, would leave. It didn't return for the rest of the week. \n\nI didn't feel safe here anymore by week three. The thing was back, I could feel it. I tried to spend as little time in my room from then on. I see the shadows more often, more drawn out. The thing has shown itself more times, each one like the last. The same wide eyes and gurgling noise from the first time, but now it appears to have a red fluid dripping from its mouth, one I can only assume is blood. Ive made a sketch of what it looks like from all the encounters. Long black limbs, stretching out for miles. It had wide yellow eyes, almost like a cat of some sort. It's face is always held in an unsettling grin with sharp, fang like teeth. It's otherworldly. I’ve had nightmares every night since my first encounter with this… thing that probably knows everything and anything about me. I know why the price of the house was so low now, I just wonder what had happened to the previous owner…\n\nWeek four... it watches me. I know it does. It shows up every night now. The eyes, the gurgle, the blood. All the lights in my room now constantly flicker. I fear it more than ever as I find that every night it moves closer to my bed. It will get me soon... I can feel it. The way it stares so blankly, emotionless… it haunts me. I’m terrified of being in my own house, but I can’t leave… I have nowhere else to go, and I’m afraid that it might follow me. For now, I live in constant fear. Fear that I won’t survive the night. That it, the thing, will get me.\n\nI will update you if I make it another week, if not, you'll know.",

        "text": "After [Henri's response](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10lfnzk/ashen_handprints_the_bar_at_the_edge_of_reality/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to me bringing Asher to the bar, I think it might be a good idea to take a break from me and talk about his past.\n\nFor most of my childhood, he didn’t tell me many details: just that he hadn’t had any family in a long time and was grateful to have one again. I was eleven when he sat me down and shared more. I’d had a particularly rough day at the bar, followed by a particularly rough near-death experience during an errand, and I came to him crying about how I wanted to run away because Henri would be better off without me.\n\nSo he explained his past to me, and when he was done, he knelt, took my hands in his, and promised that he would always, *always* be glad fate had brought us together. His lilac eyes did the intense thing where they feel like they’re staring into my very soul, but that day, I didn’t mind.\n\nEven then, though, he left a few details out. I just didn’t realize how *much* until I showed up at the bar with Asher, and then he told me *all* of it. \n\nI’m going to relay his story, the full thing, comprised of all the pieces I’ve slowly learned. It kind of puts his response to Asher in perspective.\n\nThe first thing you need to know is that Henri has been alive a long, long time. The second is that all griffins, including Henri, have near-perfect memories. Even though he is thousands of years old, he remembers everything in excruciating detail. The painful parts, especially. \n\nHe’s one of the most ancient beings alive today. When he was born, Neverland was significantly less developed than it is now; the colorful cities and organized communities weren’t built yet. Most of Neverland’s inhabitants—there were a lot fewer then—lived in small towns, largely separated by species. Believe it or not, [Griffin's Edge](https://www.griffinsedgebar.com/) has done quite a bit to break down barriers between races. They weren’t always so social. \n\nIn fact, in early times, the lines between species were drawn in blood. Inhuman crime may not be common now, but interspecies violence *was* widespread once. Vampires and werewolves feuded, dragons attacked anyone who came within ten miles of their hoards, witches ate anyone they found wandering alone.\n\nAccording to Henri, he was born on a stormy day in a tiny village consisting of all the griffins that existed at that time. Only about two hundred; griffins have always been rare. \n\nHis parents were young, recently married, but deeply in love. They were so excited to discover that they were having not one but *two* babies. That’s right: Henri and his twin sister Charlotte were born eight minutes apart, and he never let her forget that he was a whole eight minutes older.\n\nHe spent his childhood confined to the griffins’ village, by direction of his parents for his safety. “Beyond the boundaries,” his mother said, stroking his hair, “we can’t protect you. It’s dangerous out there. Vampires will drain a cute little boy like you dry. Witches will curse you if you so much as look at them funny. And those harbingers…” She shivered, her eyes drifting to something he couldn’t see. “They’re bad news. That’s why it’s *so* important that you stay in the village.”\n\nHenri nodded, promising that he would, and ran off to play with Charlotte. \n\nThat worked for several years. After all, there was a school, there were stores, there was a park. It was enough.\n\nUntil it wasn’t. \n\nHenri said he always felt this yearning, this curiosity about the other creatures out there. He listened to his parents because he knew he should, but as he got older, he understood their logic less and less. He wanted to know *why* they couldn’t try to befriend other species. He could see them sometimes, if he went to the top of the highest hill in the village: the smoke from other chimneys beyond the trees, figures in the distance that looked nothing like him, with wings or blue skin. \n\nWhen he was the equivalent of about twelve, he asked. He’d read all the history books they had in the village, and he knew the many past conflicts. But no one ever went into *why* they couldn’t be mended; they just seemed to accept that the divides would always exist.\n\nBut he heard the same from his teachers or his parents. “We’re just too different,” they said. “Many of them are dangerous.”\n\n“*We’re* dangerous, too!” he argued. “But we’re also civilized enough not to blindly take it out on others! They have villages. I see the smoke. They must be civilized too. With some rules, surely we could…”\n\n“*No,*” came the vehement response from all the adults in his life. “You’re too young to know what you’re talking about.”\n\nHe was told that repeatedly as he grew into a teenager, and after a while, he almost started to believe it. Even Charlotte encouraged him to drop it for now, saying that he could venture out when he was an adult. But for now, there was a local girl interested in him, and he should focus on that, see what it grew into.\n\nBut Henri had started to dream of another girl: a young, auburn-haired elf with pointed ears and big green eyes. *The most beautiful girl I’d ever seen,* he’d say when recalling it to me, centuries later. *And the dreams were so realistic, I’d wake up with tears in my eyes from missing her.*\n\nHe eagerly read everything about elves he could find and learned that some could visit others in their sleep to walk in their dreams. And his new dream companion confirmed just that: she’d stumbled upon him in the dreamscape accidentally at first, but after a few conversations, she was returning intentionally. He was, too; within two weeks, he found himself spending the day waiting to go to sleep, so that he could see her again. The best part of his days was the part where he was unconscious.\n\nCharlotte teased him, joking that the local girl must *really* be something if he was walking around with such stars in his eyes. He was too embarrassed to correct her, so he simply nodded in agreement and smiled awkwardly.\n\nBut his desire to meet the elf in his dreams only added to his desire to leave the village. And one night, he woke up from a particularly vivid dream in which she had admitted that she thought she loved him, his heart racing and his palms sweaty. And he decided right then that he was leaving home.\n\nHe left that night, only hours later. While his parents and Charlotte still slept, he packed a small bag of his things, dropped a hastily-scrawled note on his pillow, and snuck out the door. \n\nHenri felt bad not saying goodbye, but it was quickly drowned out by the excitement he felt at finally meeting the literal girl of his dreams, and at leaving the borders of his small village for the first time in his life. As he crested the hill at the edge of town and looked back, seeing the cluster of lights as its occupants slept, he felt only exhilaration. \n\nIt took him a few weeks to travel to her town, though to be fair, he wasn’t hurrying. He enjoyed his freedom for the first time ever, and attempted to speak to every being he came across. Some went well—he made a few friends, at least one of whom is among the group of ancient friends Henri still consults today. Some went less well; he almost died during a rough encounter with a troll. But griffins are tougher than they look. He could handle himself.\n\nStill, after some time, he reached it: a quaint town built at the base of a waterfall, nestled in a grove of willow trees. A place that was so beautiful it almost wasn’t natural, and perhaps it wasn’t. Elves have a way of bringing out the beauty around them.\n\nIt took Henri’s breath away, but it was nothing compared to how his heart exploded when he met the elven girl in a small cave behind the waterfall. He walked through, somehow completely dry despite passing under the downpour of icy water, and met her in the dim light beyond. (“She was the most incredible sight of my life,” he told me, his eyes misty as he remembered. “And she continued to be the most incredible sight every single day I woke up beside her.”)\n\nHe held out a hand to shake, praying his hands weren’t sweaty, but she wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him in for a kiss instead. When they finally pulled away, she giggled and said, “I’m Lucille.”\n\n“Henri,” he said, butterflies flapping up a storm in his belly. “You have no idea how much I wanted to meet you.”\n\nShe looked at him shyly. “I hope I was worth the wait.”\n\nHe pulled in closer. “Nothing has ever been more worth a wait in existence.” And then they were kissing again, and the whole world faded away until it was just the two of them, and nothing else mattered.\n\nLucille’s parents didn’t approve of her dating a griffin. It wasn’t long before they left together, determined to carve out their own path regardless of anyone else’s opinions. For several years, they lived happily on the outskirts of one of the first blossoming cities. A fairy Henri had met during his travels turned out to be on the city council, and she invited Henri to work in their office. It was the first real job he’d had, and since they were working to build a multi-race city—and making plans for more after it—he was eager to help. He felt like he was making a difference, shifting the culture of his world to something he had always dreamed of.\n\nFor a while, everything was perfect. He and Lucille got married as soon as the courthouse, a shiny gold building with a green roof, was completed. He moved up in the city office until he was on the council, making major decisions every day that impacted the city and future cities. Meanwhile, other inhumans were beginning to move to the city, including other cross-race couples. He had never been happier.\n\nBut you can probably guess that his happiness didn’t last forever. Not even close. \n\nSuddenly, everything that had been perfect in his life began to collapse in on itself. It started when he received a letter from Charlotte. He hadn’t spoken to her since he’d snuck out and left home behind; he wasn’t even sure how she’d tracked him down. But the letter sounded urgent. \n\n*Henri,* it read. *It’s been a while. I hope you can help. Our people are dying. There is a sickness killing off so many, a plague, but there is something else too. A killer who comes in the night, who sneaks into the village and takes innocent lives.* \n\n*I’ve heard of your fortune. You have power now. Please, you must be able to do something. There are already so few of us left. I wouldn’t turn to you if I had any other choice.*\n\n*I miss you. Love, Char.*\n\nHe panicked, of course. Inhuman-on-inhuman violence had been steadily lessening; he’d worked hard to see it happen. Walls between races were crumbling every day. And even back then, someone sneaking into a home in the dead of night to commit murders was…abnormal. \n\nHe was panicked enough that he decided he had to set out for home right away. Lucille wanted to come with him, of course, but he wasn’t willing to risk it. After all, they’d recently learned that she was pregnant. \n\n“Lucy,” he insisted quietly. “You need to stay here, where it’s safe. I’m just going to go check. There’s probably nothing I can do except get my family and any other survivors out of there. I’ll be back with Char in tow before you can even miss me.”\n\nSo he set out. Looking back, he says he should have known better than to go alone, but he wasn’t thinking straight. He just wanted to get to his village as soon as possible—plus there was a little nagging fear in the back of his head that bringing any species other than a griffin to his hometown would only cause more problems than it would solve.\n\nA few days’ journey later, he found himself approaching the hill above his old village, filled with excitement, anticipation, and dread. The smoke billowing from chimneys was a welcome sight—until he reached the crest of the hill and realized that it wasn’t chimney smoke at all, but rather rolling black smoke from a blazing fire. A fire which was spreading from building to building, burning half the town.\n\nHis heart dropped to his toes. He started sprinting, shouting the names of any friends, neighbors, or family he could think of. Even with the fire burning, the streets were empty: no panicking residents, no one fleeing or fighting the flames. Just…silence. Like the place had already been abandoned.\n\nHe ran for home. The fire hadn’t reached it yet; there were a few houses in between. Heart racing, blood running cold despite the heat of the embers around him, he burst inside, praying that someone was still alive.\n\nHe was greeted by the worst thing he could imagine: his parents lay dead on the floor, bodies riddled with the signs of disease. And directly ahead of him, a mysterious, dark-hooded figure bent over the motionless body of Charlotte.\n\nHenri thought it was a vampire, at first, drinking her blood and her soul. He ripped his pistol off his belt, took aim, and fired two shots directly into its back. The bullets had garlic in them; if it *was* a vampire, it’d at least be enough to injure it, if not kill it. “GET AWAY FROM MY SISTER!” he shouted.\n\nThe figure calmly rose to its feet, black blood oozing from its wounds. “You’ll regret that,” it growled. \n\nIt turned around, a hood hiding its face, and stepped closer. Henri wrapped both trembling hands around the pistol and fired again, directly into its chest. More black blood dripped from the wound, but then Henri watched in horror as it began to knit itself back together in front of his very eyes.\n\nWhatever this was, it wasn’t a vampire.\n\nThe creature pulled back its hood, revealing a pale, dark-haired man with entirely jet-black eyes. No whites. He grinned, a wide, hungry grin, as it advanced. “This was your sister? Tell me, then, why I haven’t seen you around these parts. Such a grand hero as yourself should have saved the day sooner, don’t you think?”\n\nHenri tightened his grip on the pistol, more for comfort than for any practical use. “You’re the one that’s been killing them.”\n\nThe man grinned. “Oh, yes.” He held up its hands and waved his fingers playfully, stepping to the side just enough to allow Henri to see the ashen handprint on Charlotte’s face. He nearly threw up at the sight. “Such a pretty thing, death. A delicate thing. Quite lovely.”\n\nHenri’s mouth was dryer than it had ever been. Still, the monster advanced. They were only a few feet apart now. “You’re a harbinger,” he said, barely a whisper. \n\nHis mother had told him about them: so called because they were held in high superstition by other races, widely believed to be omens of death. Perhaps that was because they often were; they crossed the border between living and dead and pushed others over that line too. They were meant to keep the balance of things, to guide inhumans to whatever awaited them after death, something only they knew. And mostly they did that; they were a very private people, keeping to themselves, and if you saw one, it likely meant they were waiting for you to die—that your time was near.\n\nBut they weren’t supposed to *kill* inhumans for no reason. They were supposed to be *good,* mostly, albeit creepy. For one to be murdering griffins in cold blood just…didn’t make sense.\n\nThe harbinger’s grin widened. “Very nice,” he purred. “You’ve heard of my kind.”\n\nHenri couldn’t stop staring at the handprint on Charlotte’s face. She didn’t have any of the physical signs of sickness that his parents did; she looked completely healthy, except for her glassy, dead eyes. The harbinger hadn’t killed her as an act of mercy. “Why?”\n\nHe laughed, spreading his arms. “Because I can! *I* am the balance between life and death, and *I* have decided to take matters into my own hands. All this nonsense of waiting for them to die to guide them along—what a waste of time. *I* have the power in my hands to cull some of the unnecessary weeds of this world, to speed the process along.” He wiggled his fingers again with a chuckle. “Quite literally. *I* will make the rules now.”\n\nHenri couldn’t take it anymore, not after hearing the madness coming from this man’s mouth, or the fact that Charlotte had been called a weed. He lunged forward, tackling the harbinger to the floor, and wrestled with it, trying to pull out his knife and avoid its hands simultaneously.\n\nBut the harbinger simply shoved Henri off with its arms, sending him flying into the wall with a surprising amount of strength. As he laid there, dazed, the harbinger crouched next to him. Henri thought this was the end; he thought he was about to feel hands on his skin, leaving a similar handprint and ending his life. *I’m sorry, Char,* he thought. *I’m sorry, Lucy.*\n\nOnly the harbinger didn’t kill him. Instead, it reached into the pocket of his open jacket, where the photo he carried with him of his pregnant wife was tucked. The monster plucked it out, holding it up to the light between pale fingers. He chuckled. “Well, well. Isn’t she a beauty.”\n\n“Don’t—you dare—touch her,” Henri spit out between groans. \n\nThe harbinger laughed. “I’ve always wanted to go to the city,” he said, slipping the photo into his own pocket as he got to his feet. Henri had hit his head; the world was still spinning. But shakily, he attempted to stand. Every inch of his body ached from the impact…but his heart ached more. Even the dread he had felt upon seeing the fire over the hill was nothing compared to the dread he felt as the harbinger walked towards the door, paused briefly to turn and grin, and purred, “I *said* you’d regret it.”\n\nThen he was gone in the blink of an eye, vanished into the flickering shadows of the fire burning outside, as if he had melted away into the darkness.\n\nPanicking, Henri shoved himself to his feet. His head still felt blurry, but all he could think about was Lucy, how he’d told her not to worry, that he’d be back soon. About his unborn child. And about his family, who already lay dead at his feet, who he hadn’t spoken to in decades and would never know how much he had missed them over the years.\n\nBut he didn’t have time to mourn. The fire had reached his house; the heat was rising, forming beads of sweat on his skin, and smoke was billowing through the windows as flames began to lick the walls. Not to mention that the harbinger had likely gone after Lucille. He had to get back *now.*\n\nHe staggered to the door and glanced back at his family’s bodies, unceremoniously lying on the floor. They deserved better, he knew that. He couldn’t give it to them. “I’m sorry,” he whispered. “I love you.”\n\nAnd then he ran. As he ran, as he gulped in cold air beyond the town’s borders, he let himself transform. He took his natural form: that of a mighty griffin, of lion and eagle, and flew as fast as his wings could carry him, leaving the blazing remains of his town far below.\n\nGriffins are powerful creatures when they want to be. Their wings are larger and stronger than any bird’s, and they fly incredibly fast. What had taken him several days to traverse on foot took less than three hours of flight. And every second he spent riddled with grief over being unable to save his family, and wracked with fear that he wouldn’t be able to save his wife.\n\nHe didn’t know if harbingers could travel fast; he hoped he’d beat it there. He landed on the doorstep with a gust of wind, transforming back in a puff of purple smoke, and barreled through the door. \n\nLucille was standing by the stove, near the back window, stirring a simmering pot. Henri had never felt more relieved in his life. She turned to him, overjoyed, but her happiness at his return quickly faded at the look on his face.\n\n“What’s wrong, love? Is your family alright?”\n\nShe took a step toward him, and he saw the movement in the shadows behind her half a second too late. “LUCY, MOVE!” he shouted, trying to lunge forward to push her aside. \n\nHe wasn’t quick enough. The harbinger had been closer; its hands closed around her neck while he was still halfway across the room. He met her big green eyes as the light dulled in them; he reached her just as she collapsed, and caught her lifeless body before it hit the floor. \n\n“No, no, no, no,” he muttered over and over, cradling her in one arm and placing the other hand on her neck, attempting to heal her. He’d healed so many injuries before; he’d even healed Lucy, when she’d broken her ankle falling down the stairs. For an elf, she was surprisingly clumsy. They’d joked that he’d be healing skinned knees every week once their child was old enough to run around and get into trouble.\n\nBut his healing hands couldn’t reverse what the harbinger’s ashen touch had done. He knelt there, Lucille’s body in his arms, tears silently running down his cheeks. The harbinger stood over them, grinning. “I told you,” he crowed. “*I* am life and death. *I* am the reaper of souls. *I* am—”\n\nHe didn’t even have time to react. According to Henri, it was the quickest transformation of his life, and also the least thought-out. Purely on instinct, driven by rage and grief and adrenaline, he let Lucille fall to the side and transformed, attacking the harbinger before he could slip away again.\n\nDespite his near-perfect memory, Henri doesn’t remember much of those few moments. He says it was a blur of emotion and revenge. He knows that he shredded the harbinger, enough that his black blood sprayed across the floor, enough that his body couldn’t heal the wounds.\n\nThick blood welled beneath Henri’s talons, muscle tore and bones crunched, and still he kept going. It could have been seconds or it could have been hours. But when there was hardly anything left, Henri tore off the monster’s head. And only then, when its eyes were as lifeless as Lucille’s and when the ghost of its last grin echoed on its blank face, did Henri stop.\n\nHe didn’t leave Lucille’s side all night, even though his skin was stained with dark blood. He cried over her and their unborn child for hours. He cried for his sister and his parents, too. For everyone he’d loved who he hadn’t been able to save. \n\nThe next morning, he went to the council and said he wanted to banish harbingers, to exile them for good. The others agreed; harbingers had always been bad omens, and a few had gone rogue before, using their connections to death in unfavorable ways, not unlike the one who had killed Lucille. He wasn’t the first, and he probably wouldn’t be the last. They were just too dangerous to allow in society.\n\nAt least, that’s what they decided. And Henri, who had championed the breaking of racial barriers and the union of Neverland since he was a child, spearheaded the effort. Fueled by sorrow, regret, and rage, he wanted them gone. No more chance of what had happened to him happening to anyone else, and no reminder of his own tragedy.\n\nThey were banished not long after, before ground had even been broken on the second Neverland city. Outright executing them was too much, but they essentially sentenced them to a much slower death: the harbingers, all few hundred of them—for they were a race as rare as griffins—were exiled to the dark forests, never to leave its borders again. The forests, of course, were full of unspeakable monsters and no livable land. Everyone knew it was a death sentence, but no one said it outright.\n\nAnd they went. I mean, there wasn’t much they could do, not when it was all the other races against them. They didn’t want to fight. And Henri felt a tinge of guilt as they disappeared into the darkness, but he pretended he didn’t.\n\nUntil he began to dream of Lucille again. She began to visit him every night, just as she had when they had first met, only now she was always sad. “I know you miss me,” she whispered to him, cupping his face in her hands, “but this isn’t you. Don’t let my loss harden your heart. You have so much good left to give, Henri.”\n\nIt took years for him to sleep soundly enough for her to visit, longer still for him to heed her words. By then, it was too late to bring the harbingers back; they had been erased from the history books, and any attempts to contact them went unanswered. The few inhumans brave and foolhardy enough to venture into the dark forests in search of them never came out. It was assumed they had gone extinct.\n\nSo Henri did the best he could to make amends. Now regretting his revenge-driven decision to send the harbingers away, he threw himself harder than ever into the establishment of new cities, of the union of Neverland races. If he couldn’t right his past wrong, he thought, at least he could make up for it.\n\nHe never fully forgave himself for any of it, of course. Not for his family’s deaths, not for the deaths of the harbingers. Even as colorful cities blossomed and the gaps between species began to be bridged, he carried a heavy guilt on his heart. He was never truly happy. And griffins mate for life, so he had no desire to find a new love. His heart would always lie with Lucy. \n\nThen, one night, he dreamed of something different. Not of Lucy, but of a place where *all* beings could be on equal ground. Not just werewolves and dwarves, either; oh, no. *All* beings, inhumans and humans alike. For someone whose lifelong goal had been to mend the divides of the world, it was the perfect dream. \n\nHe did what Henri does best: research. He read every book he could on dimensions and the structure of reality and how to cross between the inhuman and human. And after a few mishaps, he found it: the edge of reality. The spot where the two dimensions meet as equals, where anyone can step foot safely.\n\nAnd that’s where he constructed his bar. Once Griffin’s Edge was up and running, it started small: his old friends stopped in, they passed on the word, a few more visitors came. It wasn’t long before word got around that there was a bar, run by the last griffin in the world, where you could meet anyone from any dimension and get a reasonably-priced drink to boot.\n\nSeeing humans and dragons drink together, well, it was the closest to happy Henri had been in a long time. There was still a hole in his heart, but it was smaller now. He hung Lucille’s picture over the door and blew her a kiss every morning for luck. He told himself it was enough, that he was okay with never having a family again, because the bar gave him all the family he needed.\n\nBut then, eighteen years ago, a baby was left on the path outside. After hours, of course; no one saw who left it. He heard it crying as he swept up for the night. \n\nHenri says that the moment he walked out and saw that baby, he knew that he’d been lying to himself: that he wanted a family, and that this was it. He didn’t know what species it was, whether it was human or inhuman, but it didn’t matter. He would love it like his own.\n\nThat was me, of course. And it’s true: through all my ups and downs—which must be more than even he bargained for—Uncle Henri has loved me like his own. \n\nThat is, until I brought a member of the very race that killed his wife and sister, that he banished to the dark forests in the darkest moment of his life and thought extinct, to Griffin’s Edge.",

        "text": "[There is something wrong with my tiny house Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10jm79o/theres_something_wrong_with_my_new_tiny_house/)\n\n \n\nI was doing okay these last few weeks, but weird things began to happen again over the previous weekend. I had primarily been busy at work. If anything had been going on, I wouldn’t have noticed it. We were working on a new hologram system for a gaming program at our work. I helped develop security for online players once it went live, so much of my time was devoted to the new project. I needed a break, so I went to my buddy’s birthday extravaganza in Auburn. \n\nI would be out of town for the weekend, bonding with old friends. While I was away, I kept getting hits on my camera app. Not too unsettling; most of the things I got notifications for were deer and birds, and on occasion, I’d see Dave’s truck driving by in the distance. Also, not unusual. He had to haul feed to the cows and goats on the other end of the property.\n\nOn my last night in Auburn, I woke up shortly after midnight. My camera app had over twenty notifications in two minutes! I didn’t even know something like that was possible, yet here I am.\n\nWhen I clicked on the first notification, it was pitch black. Nothing too alarming, but when I began clicking on the third, fourth and fifth, a ball of light kept getting closer to the camera in each shot. The last notification I selected was of a blue orb and what looked to be a figure. I couldn’t make out who or what it was.\n\nI showed my buddy the next day but didn’t tell him about the previous weird occurrences, and he suggested it was ball lightning. I thought about it and decided that he was probably right. It was nothing I could explain.\n\nLater that afternoon, when I arrived home to my tiny house, I found nothing around the property that appeared off. I saw Dave coming up the drive, and he waived as he always did as he went to his home.  \n\nI decided then I had an idea. I ran up to Dave just as he got out of his truck.\n\n“Dave, remember when you told me I could look at your security camera footage? Would it be alright if I looked at it from early this morning?”\n\nDave looked at me puzzled but agreed. We went into his small farmhouse, and his wife, Margeret, offered me coffee. I politely declined, and we went into his office to view the footage.\n\nHe sat down at his computer, moved some things around, and then opened one of the browsers. He clicked on the most recent footage he had uploaded and let me sit at his desk to browse through it.\n\n“Feel free to take as long as you like. Are you still having issues up there?”\n\n“Well, I’m not sure I have any answers, but something popped up on my security footage early this morning. I wanted to compare it to what you have.” I didn’t detect any dishonesty from Dave. He seemed to genuinely be as concerned as I was.  \n\nI looked at the footage, but when I looked at the footage from around midnight, I couldn’t see anything that my camera had picked up. No ball lightning, no car lights, nobody in my yard flashing lights. It was all extraordinary. I got up, thanked Dave for his kindness again, and retreated home. \n\nI hesitated before entering my house. I looked down, and that hole had gotten bigger. I unlocked my door, tossed my bags inside, and then inspected the hole. It was practically big enough for a grown man to fit in. It didn’t appear deep enough to go anywhere; it was just a two-foot-deep hole. \n\nI called Dave immediately for him to come to look. When he got there, he did what one of you suggested. We filled it back in. Dave apologized and said he would put out some groundhog traps that afternoon. \n\nHe was so matter-of-fact; I figured he had dealt with this sort of thing before. Once we filled the hole, Dave put in some garden stone boulders. They were not sizable but heavy enough to keep a groundhog out. I thanked Dave again.\n\nI went inside and decided to relax. I closed my blinds, drew my tv screen down from the ceiling, and turned on my mini projector to watch a movie. I was watching some action flick about a maniacal terrorist when suddenly I heard something hit the window behind my head. I pulled the blind up and looked outside. There was nothing there.\n\nAfter a few moments of me looking around and then I saw it. Suddenly, hundreds of birds began to drop from the sky, hitting my tiny house and landing in the several feet of the yard I had claimed for myself. \n\nI got up, pulled up my projection screen, and went outside. I looked around, and then I looked up. Something was above my tiny house. I couldn’t see anything except the sky, but something was cloaked as every bird flying over hit that very something and fell into my yard. I looked down and saw that all the boulders were now moved.  \n\nI am not a believer in alien abduction. I have never seen a so-called UFO. Yet, something was going on out here. Dave came running out of his house, perplexed about the birds flying over and why there were so many of them. \n\nIt was about an hour when all of a sudden, it stopped as suddenly as it had begun. \n\nDave called a wildlife officer who came out to investigate the possibility of potential diseases. But after the officer inspected the birds, there were no signs of infections. They all had died from broken necks. \n\nMore puzzled than frightened, I returned to my tiny house. I locked the door and went to lie down. It was now dark out, and the stars had come out. The place was beautiful. I hated that the beauty of it made me wish I could stay forever, yet I knew even with about seven months left on my lease, I would in no way be able to remain at my tiny house. I didn’t even want my money back. I thought of subletting it to someone or using it as an AIR BNB to cover the cost I had put into it. \n\nThen the final and last straw broke the camel’s back. I had closed my eyes when my camera app went off again. When I looked at it, I could see that same woman from before in the camera. She was at my door. This time when I saw her, all my anger and fear got the better of me. I ran to the door and flung it open.  \n\n“What the fuck do you want?” Sorry about my language I don’t usually curse, but I was angry.\n\nThe woman was there this time, but there was something about her eyes. Something that I couldn’t even articulate. They glowed. I can’t even explain it, but they friggin glowed!\n\nShe looked at me under my porch light and put a finger to her lips. Then she slinked back into the night. I tried to follow her, and that is when I saw her go towards the hole in the ground and crawl in, and as he faded into the hole, all I could see was her eyes before there was nothing. The light in them disappeared.  \n\nI jumped off my porch in a frenzy and went towards the hole. Only when I went to try and follow where she went was the hole as it was before. It was maybe a couple of feet deep. Where could she have gone? There was no way she could have fit inside of it.\n\nThe following day I packed my things and went to my parents. Not something you really cared to do in your mid-thirties, but I felt I would lose my mind if I didn’t leave.\n\nDave was completely understanding. I told him I would figure out something with the tiny house. I could sell it and possibly get the money I had put into it. Let Dave use it as an AIR BNB property. \n\nUntil I figured out what to do, I would be at my parents' indefinitely. My mother put me in my old room. My father offered his advice, but when I told him about everything, he looked like a man who figured his son had a nervous breakdown. \n\nMaybe it was all in my head. I was hoping for that, but there is one thing I cannot explain. Why does my camera app still send me those damn notifications with the woman? She stands under the camera with those eyes and beckons me to come to her.  \n\nI have been overworked and exhausted, and I was sure there was a reasonable explanation. When I showed my father the videos, he seemed to be more concerned about the young woman's welfare. \n\nI couldn’t seem to express to him the fear I had every time I looked at her face. It was as if she didn’t show herself to others as she did me. Also, how do you explain that forcefield over my house? Dave’s doppelganger? All the weird stuff going on had me very unnerved.  \n\nI went to a doctor to get sleeping medication. I deactivated the camera app from my phone as well.  \n\nI feel a bit better these last few days, for the most part, now that I haven’t had to worry about it for a few days. Then last night, I got an update from my work email. It was regarding a system breach with the security program.  \n\nI noticed something strange when I clicked on the information to decipher where the breach had occurred to begin fixing it. The new gaming system had photos that resembled my tiny house. In the video game, players could activate the hologram application to appear in any room in any place or building they chose. Only the holograms would utilize the same space it was in. It would work similarly to Oculus; only goggles were not necessary because the hologram worked with the area you activated it in. \n\nYou select the hologram to appear in your display area, like your bedroom, living room, or office. So if you wanted to watch a killer character act out his rage or if you wanted to play the characters yourself, you would be in the room with them. They also could react to you. It would be like they were in there with you! Only the hologram in this game wasn’t your typical killer or action figure. It was now introducing a new character- that disheveled woman I kept seeing who was *in my tiny house!*\n\nI know this sounds crazy. Technology is crazy. There are still a lot of bugs in this new gaming system. We only have a few prototypes, so it hasn’t been made public yet. I shouldn’t even be telling any of you about it. I need to tell someone about it because I don’t know what to do. Something is using it, and what about those birds?  \n\nI asked my boss if we could shut down the program for the time being until all the bug fixes were completed. He thinks that is a good idea but only gives me a month or two to fix those issues. \n\nI’m no longer in the tiny house; I’m not there. But the other day, I noticed something else when I was working on some integration. Several viruses were not detected in the game previously. I can’t understand the language because it isn't your typical syntax-type system. It is something I have never seen. It is as if the game has a mind of its own.\n\nHere is the real kicker. One of the latest characters in the hologram game looks exactly like me. \n\nI will be tired and working around the clock, trying to understand what is happening. Wish me luck.",

        "text": "In your regular, everyday kind of scenario, a suburban swimming pool sitting next to an abandoned factory shouldn't have been all that mind-blowing. I mean, there were so, so many reasons as to why it could've been sitting there. Like, there could've been a home there once, yanno? \n\nWell, ya see, here's the thing. The pool didn't look like it belonged next to an old abandoned factory. I mean, to be fair, it's not like I've seen a lot of pools next to abandoned factories, but you'd think that the pool and the factory should have the same degree of rust, decay, growth, etc. The pool should've been mostly dried up with algae sitting on top of the remaining water, the stair bars should've been covered in rust, some of the tiles should've been missing, etc. \n\nBut this pool, man, this pool looked like Superman or someone had lifted it out of some rich guy's backyard and plunked it down into the concrete that very day. Everything was just so freaking pristine. The tiles looked as blue as the water you'd see in some travel photos and videos of, like, the Bahamas, the Caribbean, Hawaii, or whatever. And the crystal-clearness of this glass, man, looking through it was like looking through a brand new window. \n\nLooking at that, then looking up, and seeing those boarded-up windows and rusted walls in the same eye space was just so…so wild, it made me feel all dizzy. Then, to make things even weirder, the freaking pool just blinked out of existence while I was standing there in awe looking at the pool and factory together. At that point, my mind just peaced out to Oz or wherever for a few minutes. \n\nWhen my mind came back, I tried getting all the pieces of this wigged-out jigsaw puzzle together. I guess I could've just been crazy. Perhaps there were these toxic fumes or whatever that could've been leftover from when they were manufacturing asbestos or whatever dangerous stuff in that factory.\n\nBut as somebody who's all into ghosts, aliens, and all that (as well as someone who just got mind freaked by a pool) that wasn't the first thing that crossed my headspace. What my back-from-Oz mind settled on was that this lucky bastard (the lucky bastard being me) had stumbled across some actual possible supernatural phenomena. If that was true, there was the possibility that I could make, just, mountains of moolah if I filmed it and talked all about it on those interview shows and maybe wrote a book about it.  \n\nSo I got back home and asked my old man if I could borrow one of his less-than-spectacular cameras. My dad was one of the best professional photographers in the world so he had, like, the most high-end type of stuff. He would never let me borrow that kinda stuff, though. He'd just let me get the older stuff, but, yanno, it was a \"ya get what ya get\" sorta situation. Also, the older stuff was still pretty dang nice, so it would get the job done and all that. \n\nSo I got this old tripod and camera from him and I just hauled it over to the factory on foot. This wasn't that hard to do as the tripod was, like 10 pounds, the camera was five pounds and I did weightlifting on the weekends. Also, I only had to walk around ten minutes to get there. So it was all no sweat. \n\nI probably should've taken my car, though. 'Cause, ya see, me hauling all this junk attracted the attention of this little girl in my neighborhood. Sad to say, I don't remember her name or anything. Anyways, her parents were the type to go all hands off so they let her go wherever the hell she wanted. Today, she decided she wanted to go see what kinda stuff I was getting into. For some dang reason, she decided to be all sneaky about it, like I would've yelled at her had she told me she was following me. I totally wouldn't have. \n \nAnyways, I made it back to the factory and felt siked to see the pool sitting there again in all its sparkly glory. However, as I started getting the tripod all vertical as my old man had shown me, I heard the sound of tiny flip-flops pattering across the concrete. Then this tiny voice screamed out.  \n\n\"POOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!!!!!!!\" \n\nI looked up. Before the thought of \"maybe I should stop her\" even crossed my headspace, the little giggler was already a few leg lengths away from that supernatural pool. And then, and then this little dummy decided to just yeet herself into this pool even though she was fully clothed and she had no idea what the hell was even in that pool. \n\n\"Wait, get out of there,\" I said, but she was already deep down in that blue. \n\nMy body then froze like a snowman in a snowstorm. The little girl came up out of the water after a few seconds and just started floating there. She spotted me and opened her mouth to speak.  \n\nThe pool poofed away again. It didn't take all of that little girl with it.",

        "text": "I’ve been running the Abbaduk Trail for sometime now. I’d say three years at least. It’s funny how time can fly by. Anyway, I love the outdoors and camping. I’m not claiming to be an expert or anything, but simply a person driven by internal passion. I know enough to get by and not look ridiculous. I don’t know why I’m writing this. Journals have always seemed silly to me. A waste of time even. But, having one now seems almost necessary after what happened to me. Perhaps one day I’ll share this experience with the local news or one of those podcast guys I follow. Here goes nothing.\n\nWeek 1\n\nIt was 8:00 pm and I was only three minutes into my routine run. Nothing odd, just normal. It wasn’t until I reached my fifteen minute checkpoint that I heard it. Screaming. Clearly the screams of a woman. The Abbaduk Trail is located in a family friendly public park. No gates or strict regulations thankfully. Never any crime to report. But, it would seem that this particular night would end that peaceful streak.\n\nI didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t call anyone. There was no cell service. Plus, I was typically the only person on the trail at this time of night. Again, I had no idea what to do. I was mixed with emotions. I either keep running forward and possibly help who or whatever was screaming or turn around and run back home. I chose to keep going forward for some stupid reason. I can still hear those terrible screams at this point. They just didn’t stop. They were ear piercing. The closer I got to where the screaming was coming from, the louder the screams got. Mind you, as I continued running, ten more minutes had passed by. The screaming continued. It never stopped. By this time, I knew I had made a terrible mistake.\n\nIt was almost 8:30 pm and I’m right on top of the screaming. It didn’t seem right. Was this a recording? A prank? Was there someone out in the woods being tortured? Did this person somehow remain conscious and allowed to scream throughout their torment? I didn’t know and I really didn’t want to find out anymore. As I came around a bend in the trail, the screaming seemed to be coming out of the thicket directly to my right. As I slowed my pace and came to a stop, so did the screaming. Instant silence. Instant fear. I felt like I was in a horror movie. Or like being in a shopping mall where every booth attendant is about to harass you to buy something. I couldn’t move and the sweat on the back of my neck went from hot to cold. It was torture, and now I, wanted to scream. But, I couldn’t.\n\nWhat had to be no more than fifteen seconds felt like fifteen minutes. You could feel the foul energy in the air. Like standing next to an industrial electrical box with exposed wires. You just know something bad is about to happen if you don’t get away. As I stared into the pitch black thicket, I called out and said “Hello? Is there anyone out there? Do you need help?” Almost instantly, branches began to snap rapidly. It was as if something was running towards me with determination. The screaming returned too. By the grace of God, I somehow got my legs to work again and took off down the trail. I didn’t stop until I reached my home. Adrenaline is honestly a natural miracle drug. It’s truly underappreciated.\n\nOnce I got home, things seemed to be alright. No weird sounds, no nightmares, nothing out of the ordinary. Thankfully, no stalker or killer followed me home either. Not that I saw anyway. It wasn’t until the following morning when I noticed something strange. A large palm sized bruise across my lower right-side jaw. It was solid black. Oddly, it didn’t hurt, and by mid-afternoon it had completely healed away. I brushed it off as hitting myself in my sleep. Maybe I had a nightmare about a spider crawling on my face. Makes sense right?\n\nWeek 2\n\nIt is currently 9:34 am. It’s been at least six days since that terrible incident involving the screams. No more bruises or anything else weird. I’ve had a busy schedule lately and have been running in the early morning hours to keep my cardio goals met. You know, I’ve been thinking about that night a lot lately. What could that screaming have been coming from? Logically? Perhaps a mountain lion or a coyote? Some kind of nocturnal animal just doing its thing. That makes more sense than not. I mean, I am located in the southern regions of America afterall. A great spawn point for wildlife. One thing that really boggles my mind, is after three years of running this trail, why am I now just encountering this screaming phenomenon? Perhaps it was just being at the right place at the right time. Even though it almost resulted with me getting eaten possibly. At least it makes sense. Regardless, I recently bought some bear mace just in case. My schedule is getting back to normal. I think I’m going to hit the trail tonight and prove to myself that this incident was a one time thing and that there’s nothing to worry about. Wish me luck!\n\nIt was 8:00 pm when I started my run. Right on time. I hit my fifteen minute checkpoint. Nothing. No screaming this time. I was so relieved! I even saw another person on the trail. That made things so much better. Clearly a woman. She was wearing what seemed to be a hoodie of some sort, but also a gown. It was an odd combo, but who am I to judge? She waved to me as we passed one another. I couldn’t see her face, but the encounter seemed neutral enough. I waved back and said “Hello.” She didn’t reply, but no problem. It wasn’t like we were stopping to swap ghost stories or something. As I looked down at my watch, it was roughly 8:17 pm. I had only taken about twelve to fifteen steps since I passed that woman and then it started. The screaming. They were right on top of me. The same spot it had happened the first time. Blaring directly into my ears. I started to tear up and my legs went ice cold. I couldn’t move and my vision went blurry. My body is shattered with goosebumps at this point too! I have no idea why. I was in a bad situation, that much I knew.\n\nI was able to turn around to get a sense of my surroundings. To my absolute shock, the woman I had just passed no more than thirty seconds ago, was gone. I had the moon to brighten the lightless path. She was just gone. Perhaps she jumped into the woods for whatever insane reason. Was it her screaming? It couldn’t be, because the screams were too close in range to have been coming from her that far back. I really didn’t care, because I was dealing with the blood curdling screams directly in my ears. It hurt terribly! At this point, I was certain that the screaming was not coming from an animal. Or anything logical, unfortunately. One of my greatest fears seemed to have come to life in seconds. In that very moment, I don’t want to say it, but I will. I seemed to have encountered a ghost. A demon? A haunting? I don’t know. What happened to that woman? Was she even real?\n\nThe unknown terrifies me. That much I do know. I don’t believe in that stuff. Not really. I mean, I love the creepy and scary stuff. All things from movies to the haunted house attractions during Halloween. Its fun to get scared when it’s fake and safe. But, lets be real for a moment. Real life does not have such things. It can’t. These things are Hollywood produced. Or a simple story-time tool used by parents as a solution for naughty or restless children. Right? Anyway, as the screams were intensifying and seemed to began spinning around me, I started to pray. Instinctively. To God. It’s all that I knew to do. I was being harassed by something invisible. I even smacked and punched at the air around me, to make sure that no one was actually there. There wasn’t. So, I prayed for protection and that I was not losing my mind.\n\nThe screaming didn’t stop, but it did shoot back down the path towards where that woman disappeared. What was odd about the constant screaming was that it seemingly drifted away. Like it was moving in real time. It didn’t just teleport to a new location. It actually “sprinted” away from me as I prayed. The screaming continued, but from a distance now. At this point, I stopped praying, and just started running. I ran as fast as I could. As I ran, I could hear the screaming still. But, it didn’t stop and it wasn’t fading away. It was following me! Following me from a distance, but it was for sure following me. I couldn’t believe it. The type of terror this experience introduced me to. I never knew that it could be so bad. Maybe, it wouldn’t have been so bad if I wasn’t alone. Maybe, I should have just stayed home.\n\nIt was now 8:45 pm. A very long &amp; torturous run. I finally made it back to the park entrance. But, so did the screams. Tears were still burning my eyes and goosebumps were still rippling through my entire body. I was exhausted, physically and mentally. The terror would not leave my body. The screaming was still at a fair distance away, but clearly followed me. This thing was alive &amp; intelligent. I hated knowing that, so much. The possibility, no, the realization that such a thing existed. I somehow built up the courage and strength to shout “Shut the hell up and leave me alone!” And just like that, the screaming stopped. But, in its place came a loud crashing sound. Like a freight train had derailed and smacked into the nearby trees. Just for the record, there are no train tracks nearby. The sound was somehow worse than the screams. I can’t possibly describe what it was or how it was made. I didn’t stick around to find out either. After that terrifying crashing sound, I uncontrollably whispered, “Oh my God.” I turned, and ran out of the park, towards my local town.\n\nI didn’t go straight home this time. I stopped by a local diner. I needed to be around people. I needed normal life. I needed breakfast for dinner. So, that’s what I did. That same night at the diner, I would meet some of the best people in my entire life. Three guys I’ve seen around town and are around my age. I never spoke with them before. I had no reason not to, I just never made time for new friends. They had a reputation about them. They proudly believed in the creepy &amp; unknown stuff. They always attended local cryptid conventions and ghost tour events.\n\nWhat were the chances that they would just so happen to be at this very diner? This very night? After me being attacked by, dare I say, a freaking ghost. Or something of the like. I’m still logical. I believe in coincidence. I’ll stick with that for now. I just got lucky to find them here. I walked over and introduced myself to them. I told them what had happened to me no more than twenty-five minutes ago, and they believed me, without hesitation. I mean, they don’t even know me. We talked for hours &amp; exchanged contact info before we all left the diner. Little did I know just how important they would mean to me. But, I would learn that eventually, later down the road.\n\nI got home and did my nightly routines. Got into bed and started to doze off. It couldn’t have been anymore than thirty seconds, things started to get bad. This time, in my home. My safe place! My bed started to shake and rattle. Like a freaking cheap carnival ride! This was stupid and just not real! But, it was real. Very real. As my bed started to violently shake, that same high pitch scream returned and filled my bedroom. It was that thing! It had followed me home! I jumped out of my bed, almost falling on my face. I flicked the light on quickly. Then everything stopped. Perfectly timed with me turning on the light. Then, about ten seconds pass, and several decorations on my computer desk began to be hurled at me. By absolutely nothing. Living freaking air I guess! Missing me by mere inches.\n\nThat was enough for me to lose my mind! I started to scream aloud from pure terror and fled my home. I did manage to lock the door behind me. But, I was still in my nighttime attire when I jumped into my car and sped off. I called one of my newly found friends from the diner. Shaking, stuttering, and begging him to let me crash at his place. After hearing my recent event, he happily opened his home to me. By the grace of God, he was ok allowing someone he had just met to stay at his home. Somehow, after taking some strong sleeping aids, I was able to get a peaceful night’s sleep. I just wanted peace and closure. I didn’t want to return to that trail, that park, or even my own home for the matter. But, I discovered something new in me that night. A hunger, or much rather, a need. A need for answers and a way to stop this thing.",

They must have been on standby in case of something going sour like this. That scientist had somehow given their location up and risked his life to do so. I saw the commandos stationed all over the building, inside and out. Snipers and men with RPG’s were positioned in elevated places. They had more than enough weapons to start a small war. How I now know all of this information is because after the man on the roof was killed, an attack occurred, and I got myself inside building B. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere’s what happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThree days passed and it was Christmas eve when the people took over the guard's office and made it one of their communications centers. I overheard everything these people would shout to their headquarters. We were in zip-ties and placed in the locker room. We were kept hydrated and fed sometimes and Jeff was actually still quiet throughout this. I did my best to tell him that help will be here soon and to try and relax, although it really didn’t seem to faze him. We were basically P.O.W.’s at this point and I was probably a little more frightened than he was. I had to be quiet because one guy was really rude to us for no good reason. Telling us that we are going to die here and trying to frighten us. We were already helpless. However, I noticed a quick lack of morale with a couple of the soldiers. They knew they were in for it and the actual military would be here probably any minute. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“If it wasn’t for that guy esca-” One of them stopped himself and cleared his throat. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChristmas rolled around. There was heavy snowfall and their command stated that a winter storm was approaching. This gave them the thought that any attack by armed forces would be put off for the time being, but they were wrong. That same soldier who would give us shit remained inside the office with another operative for a period of time until they were ordered to report back immediately. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***“This is Theta Command. All units report to your designated battle zones. Weapons free.”***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“FUCK!” I heard the one guy shout then looked over to us. “If you know what’s good for you, I’d hide somewhere.” The other guy scrambled out without a word. “Man, screw you guys! I should just kill you both right now!” But he didn’t. He stood there and stared at us with his hands trembling. He screamed out and took off to fulfill his orders. Jeff and I were petrified in stone. They only used zip-ties so we could easily escape with one of the pairs of scissors on the metal desk. I remember thinking about just running but I valued my life and decided on staying inside this building. We got ourselves free with the scissors and stood for a moment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Let’s barricade ourselves in! What if something happens and we have to call for help?” Jeff, for once, said to me in a surprisingly low tone and we both frantically began bombarding the door using the metal desk, the fridge and filing cabinets. The two of us were strong enough to get a good blockade up. There was no time to even think, we kept finding more items to put against the door until we definitely had enough weight to hold. At least for a while. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we were satisfied, we just both looked at each other panting, and then over to the monitors. “What the hell, right?” I remember saying and we then scrambled over there to watch the feed. What unfolded, will forever be something that replays inside my head worse than any kind of flashback from my time serving. It was an absolute massacre. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, from inside the building and to the right of us, we heard the sounds of armed forces approaching. A loud *wham* then boomed from within the facility, and we saw the damage on the monitor. It was definitely an airstrike on building B. A cacophony of gunfire then erupted all around us and we saw in the feed as the battle ensued. I could see men falling to their deaths, small explosions, scientists scrambling out of the facility and getting gunned down. Helicopter turret guns ripped a handful of the operatives in half. Instead of hearing that ringing, or even jingle bells and Christmas carols on this holiday season, it was replaced with the sounds of total chaos and bloodshed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Holy shit.” I said crouching down by one of the monitors, telling Jeff we need to either get down or get in a locker. One of the handbooks stated that in case of an emergency or terrorist attack, an option would be to lock the door and call for help then find a locker. The lockers were bullet-proof and big enough for someone to hide inside of it until help arrived. Bullets were already ricocheting off the building. We had to find some cover immediately. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe locker room was a small space in the building, and I yelled for Jeff to get inside one of the lockers. “If we stay put, we’ll get shot through a window!” I shouted to him and he nodded his head. A louder explosion occurred, shaking the entire building and we stopped to look out of the window it came from. We were stunned to see that they managed to successfully target the oncoming military chopper and take it down. It spun out of control and landed right by where Phil would be stationed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHaving no other choice, we opened the lockers closest to us and squeezed in, getting as low as possible. The suffocating dread was persistently clocking down more minutes of my life no doubt. The gunfire and explosions outside were enough to drive anyone mad, but being trapped in a metal coffin on top of it was not on my bucket list. Needless to say, we were trapped regardless and just needed to wait this out. I could see through the metal vents in the locker some of the monitor displaying the battle in full effect. I had a clear view of three and even watched as some of the men were fighting each other with close range weapons as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter some time, the gunfire died down and we would only occasionally hear a pop ring out every so often and shouting. The feed was still playing, and I had a thought. There is a record option and I decided to get out of the locker and press the switch for it. I took a deep, long and exaggerated breath, then slowly got out of the locker. Jeff soon followed. “Let’s... check the camera feed. I want to record this.” I told him and he nodded. Looking around, we found a couple of stun batons to clutch onto in an attempt to feel like we could defend ourselves against any of the operatives trying to get in here and kill us. We then walked over to the monitors and found the chairs to sit down in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’d say, about ten minutes passed then. A total of forty-five minutes was how long the fighting went on for. The odds, for whatever reason, seemed to be evenly matched. This was a quick and brutal battle. Getting a closer look at things as the feed was recording everything, we noticed just how many commandos they really had. How the hell they managed to station hundreds of armed men in that facility, I have no knowledge of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I... don’t even know what to say.” I remember saying out loud instead of just thinking it. A short moment passed and as if on cue, something else was happening in one of the camera feeds that displayed an area behind building B and A. It was at this moment that a raw and all-encompassing new fear now took hold. There is really no other explanation for what I am about to tell you. They obviously should have sent a larger strike team here to fight because on one of the camera feeds displayed a person clutching a soldier up by the throat with one arm. He was doing... something... to the soldier's abdomen but we couldn’t really see. The man was at least seven or eight feet tall, maybe more and was lifting the soldier up with little effort while completely fucking bare from the waist up.  He looked to be wearing some kind of hospital garb only covered in blood and grime.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith ease, this beast of a man tossed the soldier aside like he was an empty bottle. You could clearly see the muscle definition ripple and turn red, despite the quality of the feed. He just stood there breathing into the air like a mad dog. Head violently twitching. This guy was an animal. It was already 17 degrees Fahrenheit out there. This was unnatural.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“How in the fuck is that possible!” I remember saying out loud. Just then the brute snapped his head to his left. As if in response to me speaking. I remember almost letting myself go right then and there, looking over at Jeff briefly as he looked back with shocked expressions on our faces. Before I could even react, the man was no longer on the camera feed. “Oh god, please help us.” Jeff whispered and I noticed him clearly shivering. I felt a horrible chill too and thought about getting in the locker again. I raised my arm and pointed to them, and he nodded to me. We quickly got inside the lockers again and kept the stun baton in our grasp. Seconds passed. More time passed. Suddenly, there was a burst of loud banging on the door, and I mean, loud. As I type this my hands tremble. The way I felt then... God, if you only knew.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the windows burst and a rain of shattered glass poured inside, I closed my eyes and felt the ground shake. There is no other way to describe this, but I heard something awful as this happened. There was this horrible squelching noise, as if something long and wet were writhing and reaching for something inside the office. Whatever it was, it was making contact with things inside of there. It even rustled the locker a bit. I was keeping my eyes tightly shut and after another few seconds, I was brave enough to open my eyes and try to get a peek out of the vent. There were these red shapes appearing outside the small cracks. I couldn’t quite see it all but eventually the lights went out, most likely from this thing breaking all of the bulbs and probably the monitors. I began to hear this raspy breathing through the wreckage, as if coming from a ravenous maw. I braced myself and stopped moving entirely. In an instant, everything just stopped. I tried my best to cover my mouth and breathe through little air pockets in my gloves, because I was basically hyperventilating. I’m honestly surprised my heart hadn’t burst then. I almost wished it had, looking back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA short moment passed, and we remained still inside the lockers. My breathing calmed and I was able to quietly catch my breath. Thank God for the sounds of the storm out there muffling my quiet breaths. Jeff must have been doing something similar. As the seconds rolled on, I listened closely for any sounds but only the storm persisted. Once I had the thought to close my eyes again and take another quiet breath, I heard the most terrifying noise come from out there. Like several nails on a chalkboard, only it was the yell of a man crying for help perversely mixed with a dying animal screeching in pain. That ringing came back full force and I lost consciousness inside the locker.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don’t know how much time had passed, but I woke to the sound of Jeff opening his locker. Opening my eyes, he appeared before me and helped me out of the locker. “Are you okay?” He offered. I said yes and he spoke again. “I think whatever that thing is, is gone...” I looked around, the entire office was trashed, monitors were broken and there were these dark marks all across the ceiling and walls. Noticing the broken window, I saw the blood trail that led to the forest from the facility out there and breathed deeply. That freak of nature showed no signs of being harmed by the weather and escaped this place. That thought alone terrifies me. I looked back to the monitors and noticed two of them still weakly displaying the feed. Both the bodies of the soldiers and commandos lay fallen all around, and I could see some of their weapons still intact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Jeff. I know this sounds crazy... But I have to go out there and find out what’s going on.” I said to him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I understand, I think.” He said to me and put his head down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“As a former infantryman stationed in Iraq, I feel like it’s my duty to go out there and figure something out. Anything.” I stared at him feeling that old sense of duty return to me and he raised his baton. “Do you need back-up?” He asked me and smiled weakly. I smiled back, but I honestly did not want the young man to risk his life, in case there was something else out there. Then again, someone to watch my six wouldn’t hurt at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I appreciate you, let’s go. When we get out there, snag one of their guns and let’s try and look for a radio one of our soldiers had. Ours can only reach within the facility and we might have a chance of calling out for their back up squad” I told him. “Good idea.” He replied. We devised a quick plan to get inside building B and see if there was a communication center like their headquarters still intact. “You ready?” I asked him. He took a huge breath, and I did the same. “Alright, let’s get out through that window. I’ll go first. Watch the area.” I said and we went ahead with our plan to brave the storm and head for building B.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere may be other survivors in there who could still be armed and willing to kill us. I told this to Jeff, and he said he was ready for anything after what we went through. I had the feeling we both knew this was a risky idea, but we were now in this together no matter what else would be in store for us. If no one else was coming, we had to do something and we had to do it now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the windows was broken and we could easily fit through it. The jump wouldn’t be but ten feet, so we easily made it out in the cold. It was still dark, but the sun was about to rise so we had a dim orange glow faintly aiding our sight. We both found rifles and searched for rounds and magazines. Everything was quiet now, save for the howling wind that attacked our senses and we made our way to the entrance of building B. The snow was pelting us in the face and we were covered in it by the time we got inside. The opening on the large metal door had caved in from an explosion and we slipped inside avoiding the small fires that blazed menacingly in the wind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce inside, we found out quickly just how awful this atrocity was. Not only were people shot and left for dead, but there were also bodies torn to shreds and discarded. That thing must have had its way with them because blood caked the walls and bodies lay in a gory mess. Bullet holes and charred marks from more explosions littered the walls and any surface. We both just looked at each other in shock. “Let’s go.” I said quietly and we proceeded forward, because I noticed an opening with some lights that flickered around a corner. We cautiously made our way through and got to a point where it looked like we finally hit an area with the new construction. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe addition was dug out deep below and made into this make-shift science lab. Wires and bulbs that were connected hung up haphazardly to keep the light illuminating the entire area. I could see those large speakers embedded into the rocky walls. Multiple instruments and machines buzzed or malfunctioned but were neatly stacked in an area. There was a large operating table with bolted down reinforced shackles that lay broken to the side of it. More blood and even glass was littered around this area. I even picked up a few documents on the ground, but most were stepped on or covered in filth or blood to even be legible. Scientists and soldiers, both our military and their commandos were all dead. I was speechless. There were no words to even be said at all. We just walked into something straight out of a horror film. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I’m going to have a look around those desks, you check that upper level over there and see if you can find a soldier with a radio.” I told Jeff and he agreed, aiming the rifle around and walking away. I made my way towards the set of desks that had computers still booted up. Some were destroyed and I tried messing around with one of them and opening anything that could tell me what they were doing here. I couldn’t find anything discernable. Pushing that aside, I moved towards another desk and had a look around. More bodies lay dead on the floor, and I decided to look for a radio. I bent down to one of them and moved his body to look up at me. The soldier suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the chest and face. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust then I heard a cough and aimed my weapon at the source of the sudden noise. It was one of their commandos that was still alive. I had the thought of just opening fire, but I wanted to try and get some answers. His head was slumped forward, leaning against a crate and I could see his ribcage was poking out through the torn body armor. He must have been in a great deal of pain. I used this to my advantage and approached him. There wasn’t a helmet on him, but the hairline was oddly familiar. Right as he looked up at me, I knew it was Calloway. One of the guys that had me sign the NDA. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe sputtered and blood flew from his mouth, trying to say something to me and I remained motionless, transfixed on this horrifying situation. His right arm was twitching, and he attempted to reach for what I assumed was his wound. His arm began moving faster and just as I realized he was reaching for something else, I snapped back and a muffled *pop* to my right rang out. Calloways head caved in. The pistol he went for dropped from his grip and landed to the side. I shouted out and got down to my knee, almost falling on my ass aiming the rifle around and found out there was another survivor. One of our guys had a silenced pistol aimed at Calloway and saved my life! He must have noticed my security guard patch on my winter coat and made the judgment call that I wasn’t a threat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI quickly registered the situation and called out to Jeff, rushing over to the soldier while aiming around to see if anyone else was around, almost in tears at this point. I finally got to him and steadied the soldier in my arms noticing his rank. He was the captain for this platoon. Jeff quickly made it over and the soldier was reaching for his face mask. Jeff then took off the soldier's helmet and face mask for him with ease. There was blood pooling out of his mouth, and he also had severe wounds to the abdomen. Some of the blood got onto my coat and hands, but I didn’t care. I needed to hear this man's last words now or it would be too late. He put his life on the line for THIS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Can you speak?” I asked the wounded soldier, and he was still coughing up blood quietly. He did not speak or move at first, he just looked at me with an expression one would only have on the verge of death and then with a slow and deliberate motion, he opened his front pouch and felt around for something. I saw his eyes close, and he smiled through the pain. He then frowned and pulled out a small USB port and offered it to me, still coughing. When he did this, my insides flipped, and I instantly asked: “What is this?” then took it from his hand. The soldier looked up at the ceiling while choking on blood and only said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Everything.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs his eyes rolled, his body went still, and he took his last breath right there in my arms. There was nothing else to do but gently lay him back to the ground and let the fallen captain rest in peace now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a passing moment of silence, I took one look at the USB port in my hand and bolted for one of the computers here. I popped it in, and Jeff followed, I told him to keep his guard up and he raised the weapon to study the area periodically, but we couldn’t keep our eyes away from the screen. There was a report with SEVERAL attached files. Just what I needed to see. Once the file transfer was complete, I read it all in one go as quickly as I possibly could. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo sum it up, this attack and gathering of information on a certain terrorist organization was called **OPERATION: WINTER EYES** and anyone available on call was sent to wipe out the force from a group called “TNDA” that was found on U.S. soil. Otherwise known as: The New Dawn Administration. All of what you I am about to share is obviously not meant for civilians to hear about, but all things considered, I don't really give a fuck right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout reading this, I found out that ranks within NASA had been infiltrated by one of these members and gained information about seven new planets that were within our solar system, having never been documented. Apparently, one of those planets had proof of living organisms residing there. Thermal readings and multiple satellite videos displayed these life forms fully functioning and people were beyond ecstatic. A team was of course sent out into the outer edge of the planet's rim. The ship sent a team of fourteen people, and they came back, but something terrible happened to some of those astronauts and it was seemingly because of this TNDA group. Records indicate that someone from inside the aircraft fired off some kind of relay signal that disrupted the life forms from moving and quite possibly, sustaining their habitat. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese *“creatures”* were able to somehow collectively reach the hovering aircraft from their planet and cause damage to the hull. Records indicate the impact on the damage report showed no signs of any cause for losing control out there in space. However, the report stated that several of the life forms housed themselves inside the bodies of some of the astronauts sent out there and throughout this were able to pilot their way back to Earth. The report indicated that these parasitic anomalies are only capable of feeding, reproducing and if housed inside another biological life form for a long enough period of time, can essentially rewire the human genome down to the very last cell within the unfortunate victim's body. They classified the size of the things to be about up to six or seven feet long and were considered as being somewhat similar to Taenia Solium, or pork tapeworm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nScientists, at the time of containing the initial outbreak, were able to use cutting edge technology to halt the organisms from causing any more harm and only when the spacecraft came back to the NASA station did researchers find out that this parasite was able to perfectly take over and even mimic the host it is able to feed on or infect with its offspring, which are microscopic larvae-like organisms that infect your organs from the inside and eventually taking over by reaching the brain. The organs and limbs are digested and somehow reanimated from within using this substance the larvae collectively secrete that is similar to mucus, and the main parasite can trigger commands through its own cellular network like a hive mind. It can then even intake oxygen like any other human being after a full assimilation, steadily growing larger and larger from within as the feeding continues. How large they can grow isn't documented but there was a \"Patient Zero\" that was supposed to help them determine that in humans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe scientists were, at one point, able to test these things on animals like dogs, monkeys and even large reptiles with results that would make your stomach churn. What was supposed to be a simple gather and collect data mission in space turned out to be something unimaginable and the man we just saw toss a soldier like it was yesterday's trash? Patient Zero. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatient Zero had no record of any identity, at least not on this report. Just that he was an astronaut sent to that planet and the name was blocked out. He was actually being hauled to a top-secret government prison when TNDA intercepted the smaller military convoy and successfully took the shackled brute to this steel mill, tricking Sam into thinking this was official business somehow. The military tried to track down the group but were unsuccessful. TNDA decided that this was a golden opportunity and began experiments on the subject immediately here. Acquiring all the necessary faked documents to make everything seem legitimate. There was a sidenote typed out in this section that read:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"POSSIBLE AID FROM DOUBLE AGENT: IDENTITY UNKNOWN\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe file also indicated that any other abilities of this organism while inside a biological lifeform were yet to be determined, but thoroughly studied. After more research, they concluded that certain vibrations, frequencies and soundwaves were able to control the organism from within its host, putting it in some sort of stasis. They collected *that* data from the audio logs of the mission, determining the soundwaves on that planet caused them to, in unison, vibrate on the planet's surface and are contained within the atmosphere that way. But the relay signal caused the piercing frequency to occur as they approached the unknown planet before the attack. Whoever figured that out had to be a damn genius. That would explain the loudspeakers here and it was recorded that the designated frequency would cause an amount of discomfort in human beings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen introduced to water or certain temperatures, it adapts to the environment without fail as the cellular structure of these parasitic entities are not fully known to planet earth. If housed and fed inside the invaded biological organism long enough, the human who fell victim to the parasite would appear the same as the person they were before, but only now all human emotion and empathy have been devoured. You would see a shell of the former person they once were. The report also claims if the limbs are detached or removed the cellular function within the reanimated body would cause a mutation to occur. That was the only information I could gather from this report on Patient Zero and these things they found, anything else is either yet to be documented or the government and TNDA know more...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever now, since some assholes in a fucked the fuck up doomsday cult disturbed the natural order in the solar system, we now know that these things made contact with humans and can remain housed comfortably inside a life form and like a twisted puppeteer sent from outer space. TNDA also had done their own studies, but I couldn't find any information in this building. How to exterminate these things have yet to be documented.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith all of this in mind, there was another attached file that explained how one of the underground \\[REDACTED\\] under direct command of \\[REDACTED\\] had, in fact, been compromised at one point as well. Thus, turning over a plethora of information, as well as access to a certain satellite unit's mainframe. This sole perpetrator had posed as a researcher and escaped with all of this classified intel. They made the connection that, since that top member gained access to certain satellites, they assumed he/she used some kind of jammer to block them from tracking their location after the capture of Patient Zero and fooling the military.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe man or woman, in question, is known to be a figurehead in this terrorist group and their identity has yet to be verified. The only alias they’ve uncovered is a single name of “Goldstein” and, from what the military gathers, plans on using diseases and even create bioweapons to infiltrate certain military compounds and trigger an apocalyptic event to capitalize on. Surprisingly, over the years this group gained quite the following in the underground world of this country. Ex Secret Service agents and even grunts for the marines were blacklisted and it stated that cults were being formed with agents spreading the influence all over the planet. All targets and enemies of the state. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe report also had mentioned a steel mill owner getting killed after speaking to a scientist over a radio transmission, informing the scientist of roof access. Sam is now dead because he tried to tell someone about TNDA. Ray really had overheard one of those assholes telling Sam about the dig and probably more we didn’t know about. Ray, that lucky bastard was at home. I’m glad. Wait until he gets a load of this, I thought to myself. Well, what a Merry fucking Christmas this turned out to be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter reading through all of this Jeff and I stood for a long moment and stared at the computer screen, displaying images of men that had no idea were being photographed, men in suits getting into luxurious vehicles with a security detail, what looked to be a team of researchers or astronauts at NASA, and these monstrous experiments the military conducted on animals and I could clearly see what they did to Patient Zero. They sliced him apart and reattached him time and time again to get their data. Jeff and I decided to just get the hell out of dodge, and we found Sam's old company truck nearby with the keys still in his office. Thank God there was still enough gas in there to just get onto the main road and get out of there. We got in with me driving and took off down the road and passed the burning helicopter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce we made it onto the main road there was a Military Humvee on fire near a trail that snakes off by the main road as well. It was undoubtedly one of their checkpoints that got overrun in case the battle was in their favor and civilians came around. Knowing that this place was housed in the middle of nowhere and people were rarely seen around here, I had to wonder if people could even hear the explosions and gunfire. Or even if the world was listening at all, probably distracted by their phones and devices. If they had thermals watching us from above, they let us escape because I never got stopped, nor did I stop driving until we were far away from that nightmare. This made me wonder even more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing that stuck out though, is when I took a glance in the rear-view mirror. I almost stopped the vehicle, but before I even had the thought to even slow down, Jeff said something that snapped me back to staying alive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Keep driving.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter he said this, I only nodded and sped up, because one of our soldiers was standing on the road watching us drive away from the steel mill with his stomach entirely emptied.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was over one month ago. I haven’t even watched the news or gone online and just assumed the attack was completely covered up as an accident or something. This is the first time since the ordeal that I’ve been online, and I haven’t heard anything from Jeff or Ray. Jeff asked me to drop him off somewhere near his house after that and I decided to keep moving from place to place. I doubted they would just leave me alone, so I decided on running and keeping that USB port from the soldier with me, for the time being, at least. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’m being followed now. I know it. It was only a matter of time before I either slipped up or they were just able to find me. Unfortunately, like a paranoid moron, I slipped up by using that USB port in my laptop I quickly grabbed from home along with a few important items. I just wanted to confirm again that what I was seeing wasn’t just some hallucination. However, it triggered something... A failsafe or whatever. In bold letters, a message popped up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THIS DEVICE HAS BEEN COMPROMISED.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just panicked, smashing the thing and my laptop to pieces right there in the hotel room and quickly darted out of there. I already paid for two nights but it was time to move. I don’t know who to trust. Maybe I should just let the military capture me, but I just panicked and destroyed the USB. Even if the military is trying to get to me, I don’t know if I want that kind of involvement right now after I just destroyed a piece of their equipment and ran from the facility. They have already displayed the carnage and lengths they would go to seemingly cover this up. Imagine what they might do to me. I am not only paranoid but terrified beyond words and have considered just taking my own life after I post the story here. Maybe the military will help, after all. I don’t really know if I want to take any chances. Normally, I wouldn’t take such drastic measures, but I am just a nobody anyway and whatever they have in store for me just might be worse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I sign off, I said that I was being followed, sure, but the TNDA or the Military isn’t the only force I am worried about. That thing escaped from the steel mill and there was another topic that went over my head throughout everything I had taken in. These things are capable of infecting a host and the soldier that was being gripped by Patient Zero had to have been completely taken over by now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI keep seeing these people randomly appear before me throughout my time of running. They would be standing somewhere, eerily watching me from a distance. It would be a different person every time. I would notice them, and they wouldn’t move a muscle. They would just remain still with their eyes fixed on me no matter where I would go. I would walk through a crowd of people, drive somewhere, take a risk and grab a bite or a drink somewhere and boom, they would be there. Faces fixed in a blank expression focused on me and only me. Somewhere either outside a window or even close by being mere feet away. If these things somehow perfectly blend in with society, then we need to know. I can’t imagine you would want to be kept in the dark about something like this, let alone fall victim to one of these things and if TNDA somehow captures this monstrosity again, then who knows what might happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's late in the morning and I am currently held up in some shitty hotel room yet again, paying cash and not using my card or real name for anyone to track. I've taken to drinking again and eat sleeping pills like candy every night to attempt at blocking out my night terrors. Wow, I didn’t even realize how long this had gotten. Even so, when you go through something traumatic, re-living the experience can become easy.  I honestly don’t know where else to go and to whoever who actually takes the time and reads this, just know this. Something beyond our wildest imaginations exists out there and there is nothing we can do about it. Let this be a warning to those who wonder about the secrets of the world. Lock your doors, give your loved ones a hug and a kiss and remember that danger could be closer to home than we may think. Hopefully, someone who can actually help reads this and does something. The world may very well depend on it.",

I could sleep with ease again, I stopped hearing those god-awful screams and stopped seeing those freaky library nerds! life was easy now, without those distractions. \nI felt good about myself and decided it was time i picked up a job again because that had been too hard to combine with school. not now, though, it was insanely quiet in my head now, and i needed the distraction. \n\nI had long forgotten about the delusions by the time i was offered a job at the local library, and didn't question it when i was asked if i'd mind doing a late shift - in hindsight, what kind of fucking library would be open 24/7 - on the weekends. \nit paid well, better than the earlier shifts and i had always been more of a night person anyway, so of course i agreed without hesitation. a perfect job, a perfectly manageable schedule, and good money. almost seemed to good to be true, ha!\n \nanyway, uhm, the person that showed me around didn't say much, I remember thinking she was crazy, when she finally did, though. she told me something about a mirror behind the desk. told me to never turn my back towards it or take off the blanket, shielding the piece of antique. I wish I had taken that serious because, the second I turned my back towards it on my first shift, I started hearing whispers from behind me that seemed to be muffled by something.\nI waved it off at the time, turned my music louder, and eventually I must have even dozed off, as i remember abruptly being awoken by a scream. \n\n'Hey, lady,' a voice spoke, quickly followed by the sound of fingers being snapped. \nMy name, I heard my name, it kept getting repeated, and it kept getting louder. It hurt.\nI looked up and smiled at the voice, looking up. for a split second, I could swear I saw a faceless thing, but when I blinked, it was a perfectly normal teenage boy. \n\nthe boy scared me, even though I could easily take him: he looked lanky and disoriented, but that faceless thing was all I could see as I led him towards the history books he'd asked for.\nI still heard my name, but it was distant now, as if it was scared of this boy, too.\n\nI do not remember the rest of that day.\n\nI remember walking to the library. I remember that the faceless people returned, always pointing at the library. I remember the library. \n\nI remember \n I don't \n\nI remember, I know that he's back\n\nI've seen you before\nI remember you\n\n\n\nIt's back, ,,, .",

        "text": "This is about the last few months leading up to this week-ish. \n\nSo, some background, I (F14) have moved around a lot in the past few years. I've lived from the ocean to the mountains in a matter of a few months. Moving a ton means a ton of schools. So recently, having moved, it was towards the end of the year, so I'm coming into a new district beginning of my freshman year. \n\nSure, that's ideal. A bunch of people are moving around. That fine. But walking into this new school for the first time, I feel like I'm gonna barf. I'm usually nervous (having a general anxiety disorder does that), but this feels different. It felt like the feeling you get when walking alone dark at night. That dread, the pit in your stomach that will never leave. \n\nI put the nerves up for being the fact that I knew no one. I mean, anyone's nervous first day of school. I told myself that I was being unreasonable. I told myself that I should be less nervous. I knew some people, having tried out for volleyball and made the team prior to the school year starting. \n\nThe first school day went on fine. It was school, so nothing special. But better than all the endless scenarios my mind put before me. I even met someone! It was towards the beginning of the day, so I had someone to hang out with throughout all our mixing classes. This was going to be easy, I thought. \n\nBut I thought that too soon. \n\nThis all began while I was walking to the locker room to change for volleyball. I had gotten a bit lost, and I bound to be late if I wasn't changed within the next 10 minutes. \n\nWhile walking past the quad, I saw a group of five girls. They were stood in a circle, and I could only make out the face on one. They were all looking down, facing something thar was on the ground. \n\nThat wasn't that part that made me stop dead in my tracks. It wasn't that part that made me forget momentarily about practice. It was the girls face. The only one I could see. \n\nShe didn't have eyes. She didn't have eyesockets. Come to think of it, she didn't even have a face. Well, facial features. \n\nAnd that may sound crazy! Hell, I thought it was crazy. And maybe I am, I don't even know why I'm telling this to a subreddit. It's probably a stupid idea. But trust me. I'm not. I wouldn't be saying this if I wasn't sure. \n\nI may be sure, but if I'm not the biggest idiot alive for what I did. \n\nI stopped, directly parallel to her. Looked at her for a solid two seconds, and whatever decided to go through my brain was my last braincell, and it was on its way out. \n\nI threw my hand up as if I was raising my hand in class and yelled at her, \"YO, I THINK YOU FORGOT YOUR EYES ON THE WAY OUT!\" Thinking back, maybe that wasn't the wisest decision. The girl raised her head slowly, stopping as if she was looking at me. \n\n\"Hey!\" I looked away from the girl. It was my teammate, whom we will call K. \"Why aren't you changed? The coach is going to be here any minute.\" \n\n\"OH shit, you're right.\" I followed K away from the group. I glanced back once, and all five were staring directly at me. They all looked the same as the first girl. There are no features at all. No eyes. But I still felt as it they were staring into my soul. \n\nWhen we walked to the locker room, K stopped me right before we walked in. \"Hey, who were you talking to?\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"You were just yelling at air. Are you trying to be known as the crazy freshman?\" It was framed as a joke. But it told me a lot. \n\nI laughed. \"Yeah, you're right. Thought I saw something.\" K laughed and changed the subject. \n\nI thought at the time I was going crazy. Maybe I still am.\n\n\nThe next week or two followed a similar routine. I went to class, did minimal learning, and then I went to practice. On my way to the locker room, I would see one of the girls. I've decided to number them since I never learned their names. \n\n1, the first one I saw, had bright red hair, she was fairly pale, and decently tall. She always wore some sort of bright color. Maybe a yellow, maybe a pink. It she had a face, she'd be pretty. Actually, they'd all be pretty if they had faces to go along with it.\n\n2 was the exact opposite. She appeared more often than the rest of the group. She had darker skin and dark brown hair. She was shorter than 1, but I think 1 is the tallest. She wore darker clothes, an occasional yellow. \n\n3 and 4 looked almost identical. Maybe they were twins, in whatever strange group this was. They both were short. And were both tan, as if they spent too much time in the sun but never burnt. The only difference was that 3 had a brace around her foot, while 4 had one around her wrist. Strange. The two usually appear together, which helps when I was first learning the five. \n\n5, well, 5 was the strangest. I've only seen her once, besides the initial encounter of the group. And even then, I'm not entirely sure she was there at the time. She wore glasses, and her hair was short. She had bangs that were entirely too long. They covered her glasses, making them, in theory, useless. But if you don't have eyes, glasses are useless anyway.\n\nIt is human nature to be curious. It's a terrible trait, really. A stupid one at that. I guess natural selection never heard of the phrase curiosity killed the cat. But then again, I've heard the phrase, yet I still decided to research this.\n\nAt first, I asked I others. \n\nI asked my friend, we'll call her J, about the girls. She has been in the district for a while and has an older brother. If anyone knew about the strange girls I kept seeing. Wording it to not make me sound like a psychopath was hard.\n\n\"Hey, J, have you ever heard of people seeing faceless people?\" She looked at me concerned.\n\n\"Like, schizophrenia?\"\n\n\"No! Like, ghosts.\" She shrugged, telling me no, and if she did, she doesn't believe in ghosts. \n\nGreat, she thinks I'm insane. I ended up shrugging, giving up on the topic. \n\n\"Just curious.\" I said. She seemed to believe it. \n\n\n\nThe next week, i saw none of them. I thought maybe my brain made them up. Maybe i was so nervous that my brain made up an excuse to be nervous. Annoying, but reassuring. I'd rather be a little insane than haunted by five ghost girls. \n\nThat Friday, volleyball practice was canceled, basketball priority. So i just got picked up right after school. I saw 5. She was just standing there outside of my house. I told my sister to go inside, that i had to do something for a moment. She looked at me, confused but obeyed. \n\nI walked up to five, waving my hand in her face. \n\n\"Hey,\" I sat on the step next to where she was standing. Maybe it was like the IT movie. Don't show fear, and she'll go away. \"I think I may be going insane. If you could talk to confirm that you're real, that'd be great.\" She didn't talk. She just turned her head to look down on me. I didn't know what to do, so I patted the spot next to mine. \"I'm sorry for yelling at you and your friends.\" I smiled at her. I thought at the time, maybe they're just lonely. So I pulled out my phone and just began scrolling. \n\nEventually, I would look up and see that she left. But i was glad i took the time to do that. \n\n\nNothing happened for a few months. Nothing paranormal. Nothing even strange. I thought that by hanging out with 5, by conquering my demons, I had solved whatever was happening to me.\n\nI almost forgot about the strange girls who showed up. Every now and then, i would lay in bed, unable to sleep, just thinking about the weeks where I was so on edge on the ghosts that seemed to prove my insanity. \n\nBut if that were the end of it, I wouldn't be telling this story. The paranormal activity started up again the week prior to this last. When K and I were sitting in math class. Neither of us was paying much attention to whatever strange quadratic equation was being taught to us, although K seemed more off that day. She was quieter. \n\n\"Didja know there was a huge kidnapping case about two decades ago at this school.\" The suddenness about it all threw me off guard. \n\n\"Uhhhh? No? Why?\"\n\n\"Rember on the first day of school when you were acting strange?\" I nodded. K stared straight ahead. It looked like she was listening to our math teacher at the same time as telling me the story. \"Well, last night I remembered the incident, and I got to thinking about it. I don't know, you only said it a handful of times after that, but you looked so convinced that you saw people.\" Even though she was whispering, I still felt like people were listening in on our conversation, even though the class at the time was fairly loud. \n\nI shrugged, turning back to my screen, \"Yeah, I was convinced at the time. But I think it was just a stress-induced hallucination. I had a lot going on at the time.\"\n\n\"Maybe. But as I was saying. I was talking to someone about it, and they pointed me in the direction. Actually, it was one of those huge unsolved cases. The only reason people concluded that they were intertwined was because of how they all ended up being found.\"\n\n\"Were they..?\"\n\n\"Dead? Yeah. But that's not what I'm talking about. Their eyes were removed. Skin near the eye socket was burned. Made them all melted.\" My head dropped. \"I don't know. The whole thing just reminded me of the situation. But, you're into the crime stuff, right? Maybe it's something you can look into.\" K said nonchalantly, turning back to whatever problem she was on. \n\nWhen I got home that night, I spent the entire night researching. And sure enough, those were the five. \n\n1, she was a sophomore, kidnapped second. She did cheerleading and was part of the debate club. Even though she was kidnapped second, she was found first. \n\n2, the last taken. She was a sophomore as well, but wasn't really known for doing much around school. She got decent grades and did an occasional drama production. She was found a week after 1.\n\n3 and 4. 4 was taken a couple of days before 3, and allegedly, 3 was only out looking for 4. They were both freshmen and twins. 3rd and 4th taken. 3rd and 4th found.\n\n5, the first taken, the last found. She was a sophomore. There wasn't much else released about her. Apparently, her parents were less open. She shared information about her on the news. \n\nThe five were all kidnapped and found within a span of 3 months. Other than the oldest being 16, youngest 14, and them all being girls, none of them had much in common. They seemed to be taken at random. At least, that's what the cops say happened.\n\nI feel bad for their parents. Their children hurt, and they never got closure. It wasn't like I could just stop by their house. I wasn't trying to be stupid. And it wasn't like I knew where they lived. \n\n\nI didn't sleep much that night. \n\n\nThe next night, I woke up from the worst nightmare I think I've ever had. I don't remember much, but I remember thinking I was dying. I remember being in the woods, alone. At one point, I think I saw a car passing by. I saw lights.\n\nI remember being restrained. A hand was held against my mouth, hokding me down, and I couldn't breathe. When I did, I swore I smelled burning. I felt burning. Then it all went dark. I don't quite remember if the dream went dark, or that's where my memory stops. Either way, I felt blind. \n\nI wanted to scream and cry. When I woke up, I remember doing both. \n\n\nOn Thursday, the pit in my stomach appeared again. Just like on the first day of school. The nerves were back. I was scared to walk into school. My mom noticed and asked if I was alright. I just nodded, waving off her worries. \n\nThroughout the day, I felt an immense sense of dread and paranoia. I kept thinking I saw one of the five. Then I would turn around, and I'd be nothing. I kept thinking back to the dream. The dream that I could hardly make out, but if I thought enough, i could put together the pieces.\n\nWhy was I the one seeing these dead people. I didn't believe in ghosts. I don't care for them. I used to make fun of paranormal situations and laugh. Watch buzzfeed unsolved and call out the bullshit of the people talking about haunted locations.\n\nBut why me. I regret coming to this stupid school. I regret yelling at those girls. Sure, I feel bad. But I don't want to get wrapped up in something. Whenever a movie protagonist does that, they end up injured or dead. \n\nAnd it wasn't like I'm a particularly strong person. There is nothing about me that would make me capable of solving this case. \n\nSo I regret trying to.\n\n\nWhile I was walking out of the school on Thursday, I saw the group again. It was the first time since the initial encounter that I saw all five. They were lined up. It went, 51432. First to last taken. Great. I tried ignoring them at first. I tried just walking past them, but I couldn't. They would appear in front of me whenever I tried. \n\nStrangely, they kept getting closer to this back road. A dirt road behind the school that led to this deserted wooded area. \n\nI've mentioned I'm a bit of an idiot and make stupid decisions. So I decided to follow them. I grabbed my sister, who was waiting for me outside if the school, and led her towards who was picking us up, telling them that I was hanging out with a friend, and that I'd be home later. They seemed to accept that answer and left.\n\nI followed the five into the woods. The feeling of dread returning with a vengeance. I kept my finger hovering over the 911 dial, hoping that if anything were to happen, I'd be able to call them first. \n\nAfter a solid 15-20 minutes of walking through the woods, the five stopped. No matter how much I walked past them, they wouldn't move. The area was open, all the trees surrounding this one portion in a circle. \n\nThe five just stared at me. I couldn't tell what they were thinking. Maybe they thought I was an idiot for following them. Maybe I was about to be next. In all honesty, it was easier not to look at them. I felt bad whenever I did. \n\nAt one point, the five disappeared, leaving me alone again. \n\nGreat, I remember thinking. Even my ghost friends don't wanna hang out. I was about to turn back and try to figure out how the heck I was going to get home when I heard a snap. I turned around to where i heard the snap, and I saw a person. \n\nA legitimate person. Not some ghost. It was a person with features. And even though they had a face, they didn't seem to be very expressive. Their face was so distorted that i couldn't even tell if they were a boy or girl. Maybe it was cause they were old. \n\nI awkwardly waved, holding my phone closer to me. The person didn't move, just stared to where i was standing. I looked down, and it was a small mound of a bunch of dug up dirt. I rushed off of the mound, looking at the person. They still didn't move. \n\nThere couldn't be anything in these woods that they could've wanted. I took a couple of slow steps back. It wasn't like I had some sort of weapon. So if they decided to rush at me, my best bet was the fact that I was decently fast.\n\nThe person grabbed a stick from the floor and walked towards me. I didn't stick around to tell what they were going to do with it. I just ran. I ran to my school parking lot and ended up getting a ride from a friend who hadn't been picked up yet. \n\nThat leads me to today. I haven't left my room. What the old person was doing there, I didn't know. Maybe they were just collecting sticks. I didn't know. But taking into account my weird dream, then the five leading me to the woods, I wasn't gonna take that chance. \n\nA few minutes ago, right as I started writing this, my mom came into my room to talk to me. \n\n\"I need to talk to you about something.\" I put down my phone to listen. \n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"There has been a kidnapping at your school. A girl in your grade. They are closing the school for a few days next week to see if they can try to catch the person. I don't want you leaving this house without someone with you, okay?\" \n\nI agreed. \n\nBut I don't think I could fully listen to it.",

        "text": "As I drove home from work in the middle of the night, a crying woman covered in blood came running out of the forest. I saw her only milliseconds before she left the thick grove of trees on my right. Her eyes were wide and uncomprehending, her mouth open in a perpetual shriek, her clothes torn into rags- but otherwise, she was beautiful and young. I saw only the merest glimpse of a slender white leg before I instinctively turned the steering wheel all the way to the left, trying not to hit her.\n\nAt the speed I was going, and with the constant rain falling down from the sky, I quickly lost control of the car. I missed her by mere inches as I swerved into the oncoming lane where, thankfully, no cars were coming. In slow motion, I saw the road pass by and then start to rise up to meet me as the car began to flip. I felt like I was in the air for minutes, but in reality it was likely only fractions of a second. Then the car landed, the black pavement rushing up to meet me, and my vision turned to blackness.\n\nI woke up suddenly in a white room, the walls seeming to be made of high-intensity LED lights. They were so bright and white that it almost hurt to look at them. I squinted my eyes slightly, and they slowly began to adjust to the overwhelming white light surrounding me. I stood up and looked around, rising off of a bed made of the same kind of light.\n\n“Where am I?” I asked. No one answered. I began to walk forward, and a building began to materialize around me suddenly, the white light all draining out of the bottom of the room like water running down a drain. I was in a castle, in the entryway looking out massive black gated doors. I looked behind me and saw the bed was just a bench with flat pillows inscribed with roses and cherubs. The castle seemed to stretch forever in a straight line, hallways with endless mahogany doors disappearing into a point in the horizon. No one moved in the rooms or the hallway. Outside, birds chirped pleasantly, and a tropical, sweet-smelling breeze blew past me.\n\nI turned my attention back to the front gate, deciding to go outside. As soon as I stepped outside the shade of the castle, a blazing sun warmed me. I instinctively put my arm above my eyes to dim the summer light. \n\nAs my pupils constricted and I was able to see better, I realized that the light overhead was not coming from a sun, but many eyes looking down at me from the sky. They all sent out some light of their own, brighter than a full moon but far dimmer than the actual sun. I could look up at them and see them moving around, their pupils dilating and constricting as each eye focused on something new. They stayed in constant motion, and there were thousands of them, covering the sky with white sclera, gray, purple and green irises, and constantly flicking pupils as far as my eye could see.\n\n“Those are the eyes of God,” a voice behind me said. I turned and saw a beautiful woman there, holding out her hands towards me. She had green eyes that shone like emeralds and a sweet, melodic voice that instantly calmed me. “You are in Heaven. You did it, you beautiful child.” She came over and put a hand on my cheek. It burned with her touch, sending waves of happiness through my body. As I looked closer at her, I realized she had on platinum armor and a scabbard, with an obsidian sword handle sticking out of the top. Tiny diamonds and emeralds decorated both the scabbard and the handle.\n\n“This isn’t like I imagined Heaven to be,” I said, looking at the trees all around us. They were covered in silver and gold, rising up hundreds of feet in the sky. They stood like skyscrapers, swaying slightly to and fro as the tropical breeze blew the smell of fruits and ocean through the air. At the top, I saw what looked like people moving around, flying even, but they were so high up I could barely make them out even when I squinted.\n\n“Well, the truth is,” she said, her smile widening from ear to ear, showing dozens of sharpened, blood-soaked teeth, her voice deepening and turning into a hissing gurgle, “God killed himself to make this world and your world and everything in-between.” She brought her other hand up, and now the waves of pleasure I had felt were replaced with burning pain as she scratched me with huge talons that had suddenly exploded out of her fingers. Her skin began to blacken, but the eyes stayed green, expanding into circles of luminous viridescent light between folds of black, rotted skin. Massive black wings unfurled behind her, squirming with millions of maggots that constantly fell to the ground, writhing as they tried to return home. The smell of the wings made me gag- reminding me of a combination of burning rubber and rotting roadkill.\n\nI screamed, clutching my cheek and feeling blood running down it in rivulets. I turned, running away from this monster as fast as I could. The eyes above me seemed to move faster, as if they had been agitated.\n\nAt that moment, four people rushed from the forest waving swords and crossbows. They barely seemed to notice me, focusing entirely on the female shape-shifter behind me. She hissed at them like a snake, sending her long, forked tongue flicking out of her mouth and pulling her glowing sword from its scabbard. With a battle cry that made my ears ring, she rushed forward, slicing off the head of the man in front. I saw it fly across the air in slow motion, the man’s body falling to its knees. He still had a look of surprise in his eyes when his head landed a few feet to the left of his body on the tropical white sands of the ground.\n\nThe others wasted no time, using the female’s distraction with the front sword-wielding man to attack her ferociously. One shot her directly in the neck with a crossbow, the bolt piercing through and reminding me ludicrously of the bolts on the neck of Frankenstein’s monster. She screamed with rage and pain as another rushed her from the left, swinging a massive broadsword at her jaw. Time seemed to slow down as the sword connected, cutting through the skin of the monster easily. As it penetrated deeper, sickly green light began to shoot out the wound, and by the time he had fully decapitated her, the light was so blinding I could no longer look.  \n\n“We have to go!” a woman screamed, pointing up to the tops of the massive trees. Looking up, I saw dozens of flying specks, looking like an agitated hornet’s nest as they regrouped and began to approach. As I squinted my eyes, I realized they were more of the black-skinned monstrosities, coming to the aid of the one this group of humans had just killed. I doubted whether they would be able to help her, as one glance at her body showed me her head hung on only by the spine and the associated ligaments and flesh in the back of the neck. She didn’t move anymore and the sickening green light had all evaporated. The maggots still swarmed, however, and voraciously began to move from the wings to the rest of the body.\n\nThe woman grabbed my arm, forcing me to run into the forest with her. The rest of the group was ahead of us. I heard the shrill battle cry of the flying monsters landing behind us, but the woods were growing thicker and the constant sharp turns of the leading members of our group would make it harder to find us.\n\nAfter a couple minutes of running, the shrieking and screaming falling further and further behind us, the man in front stopped suddenly. He opened up a camouflaged tunnel, pushing aside some of the silver leaves that covered the top of it. The rest of the group jumped down, then the man gestured for me to jump down. The fall was only a few feet, and I realized there were torches burning in a cramped tunnel. I walked forward, hearing the man close the door and land just behind me, pushing me forward. \n\nWe quickly came to a round room with a massive long table down the middle of it. Dozens of swords, crossbows, daggers and tridents covered it, all seeming to glow with their own soft, silver light. At the nearest end, the table was cleared and chairs were set up around a steaming pot. A chubby man ladled out bowls of delicious-smelling stew, smelling of mint, rosemary, potatoes and beef. He motioned for us to come sit down and eat. I hadn’t realized it until then, but I was absolutely ravenous.\n\nThey introduced themselves, and we sat down to eat. They poured delicious-smelling wines from crystal pitchers, and I ate the beef stew and drank red wine as they told me everything.\n\n“This is Heaven,” the chubby man said, sitting down on the bench across from me and pouring himself a glass of the wine. “Or at least, it used to be. It isn’t Heaven like most people think of it anymore. Remember, I don’t know all of this absolutely, but I’ve heard most of it from the angels and others who have been here a long time, so at least most of it is true.”\n\n“You mean that shape-shifting monster…” I began. He nodded.\n\n“Those are the angels. They have become rabid and evil over the last few billion years. But I’m getting ahead of myself.\n\n“Nearly 14 billion years ago, God killed himself to create the universe. He cut himself open and let eternal amounts of mass, energy and consciousness pour out of his body, an action which became known to us as the Big Bang. All of this matter had nowhere to go within God’s body, so it created our universe instead.\n\n“Now God dying isn’t like you or me dying, you understand. God dies very, very slowly. It is like he has been bleeding out this entire time, but now he is truly close to death. In our universe’s time, maybe another 1,000 years at most and he will be gone. Once he goes, the entire universe as we know it will go too. It will instantly turn into blackness once the light of his consciousness no longer lights the stars and worlds of our universe.\n\n“These angels here, they got an idea that if they fed the human souls in Heaven to God’s mouth, he would live slightly longer. And it seems to be working- every time they feed him a few thousand souls, he seems to heal slightly. But he is still dying. At most they might delay the end by a few centuries, but even that seems doubtful.” The man shook his face, his jowls shaking slightly. “You can’t really die in Heaven, as even if you get your head cut off, it will grow back after a couple hours. But if they feed you to God’s mouth, then you do, in essence, die. Your consciousness is digested by God and it is fed throughout his body, dissipating into the eternity within him.”\n\n“Where is God’s mouth?” I asked, and all the people in the room looked at each other, a sour expression on their faces.\n\n“It is at the end of Heaven,” the chubby man said, his eyes downcast. “It is… a horrible thing to behold. Trillions of gnashing teeth, endless insects infesting it and screaming in unison. Since his body began to fall apart, the insects of Heaven have really begun to consume His flesh… I think it is driving God insane. A lot of the terrible things in our world might be arising from his insanity and dying- the World Wars, the death camps, the mass killings by Communists. But that is just speculation, I don’t know that for sure.”\n\nAt that moment, I heard a loud crash outside. Shouts and running from above us made everyone deathly silent. Then the hidden trapdoor leading down here was flung open and angels began pouring down the opening, carrying glowing swords and crossbows. They instantly attacked, dozens more coming from behind them. They slashed at the chef. He absurdly raised his wine glass in front of him as if that would stop the sword flying down towards his skull, but instead it cleaved his face in two, and he fell backwards. Within seconds everyone except me was moaning, dead or dying, on the ground. The angels began to pull their hacked-up bodies out, then approached towards me, their dead, black eyes staring daggers at me as I backed against the dirt wall of the hidden shelter.\n\nJust as they had all surrounded me, and one was raising his sword to cut me open, I began hearing sounds that didn’t fit.\n\n“Clear!”\n\n“Again!”\n\n“He’s waking up!”\n\nAs the sword came down towards my face, I suddenly opened my eyes, my other eyes, feeling the cold, damp pavement beneath my body. I looked around and saw myself surrounded by paramedics, a Lifestar helicopter loudly descending a hundred feet further down the road. I saw the naked woman who had run out in front of my car in the back of an ambulance. Then I closed my eyes and fell back asleep.\n\nThe doctors at the hospital told me I had been clinically dead for five minutes. Apparently the woman I had almost hit was the latest victim of a serial killer. She had escaped from him and ran blindly into the road out of mortal terror. I didn’t blame her in the least, and was simply glad I hadn’t hit her.\n\nBut the vision of Heaven I had received was the most disturbing thing of the entire experience. It truly changed my life, and not for the better.\n\nI wasn’t afraid of dying before. But I certainly am now.",

        "text": "The book I have read before, it’s well known to me, a comfort, familiar, certain. The spine is well cracked and the pages well worn with a slight bend to the cover in the right hand corner. A book well travelled. \n\nI’m nearing one of its most pivotal moments, our protagonist has arrived outside of the legendary chateau, impressed by its facade, its stature, unaware of the horrors that lay ahead. \n\nI’m comfy in my seat, firmly settled in, secured by a single belt across my lap; I pull the strap a little tighter. \n\nOur hero enters his new abode, anxious to get to work on the important real estate. Excited to one day introduce his family to their forever home. \n\nI glance outside my window, a chaotic tirade of cloud, smoke and fast whirring images. Wispy white cotton wool fills the space.\n\nOur fellow walks cautiously through the candle lit hallway, adorned with antique furniture and an old tatty red rug. Apart from the rhythmic ‘clip claps’ of his hardy boot heels on the wooden floor, the house is silent. \n\nShouts, screams and unfamiliarity reverberate into my ears, nearly, but not quite, drowning out the pulsating of my own blood vessels and pounding chest. \n\nHe progresses down the hall into a dimly lit round study, floor to ceiling bookcases are filled to the brim with classics; sandwiched and squished next to each other, standing cover to cover, like peas in a pod. \n\nI feel the brush of another passenger’s arm, an electricity passes between us followed by intermittent tremors caused by uncontrollable sobs. A small friction between the hairs on my arm and theirs comforts me. I don’t look at them. \n\nThe study is dusty, untouched for quite sometime, tiny particles of smut fill the air, a mix of dead skin, hair and earth. A dryness enters his mouth, coating his teeth, his gums, his lips. A dry cough escapes leaving a brittle taste. \n\nA sudden jolt allows me to defy gravity for a split second. The impact causes me to accidentally bite my tongue, a salty, iron taste emerges like I’ve just licked a penny. I swallow. \n\nHe reaches for one of the books, ejecting it from its long standing home, it is hard-backed and embossed with a beautiful gold clasp. He removes the remaining dust with one short blow, the dancing of powder tickling his nostril hair producing a not so unpleasant musty smell. \n\nA merger of sweetness, fuel and chemicals inhale my lungs which is slightly assaulting. For the briefest moment, I feel euphoria, which is quickly replaced by consternation and dizziness. Thick fumes wave over me making it difficult for me to read what comes next despite me desperately trying. Through the disorder, I forget the storyline, unsure of where we travel next with our fellow passenger. \n\nI hear the whirring of metal on metal, I smell the odour of burning oil and rubber, I taste a harsh and bitter acid which leaves my mouth tingling, I feel a refreshing gale of wind as it whips and vibrates my cheeks and I see an array of objects in the air, their metallic parts reflecting in the sunlight. Ah I remember now.",

        "text": "I finally decided to come on here and share my 13 year horror story with you. I'm just going to break everything up into short stories and I'm only going to tell the scariest of the scariest since so many things happened almost daily. \n\nThis house was a older house in a lower to middle class neighborhood. It had a long driveway and a separate brick garage in the back about 30 ft from the house. Between the house and garage there was a clothes line hanging up. It's believed to be on a native burial ground but I can't confirm nor deny that.\n\nI've always been connected to the other side and sensitive to seeing, hearing and smelling spirits. \n\n( Stories aren't in a particular order ) \n\nOne day I was about 5, my mom was standing outside grilling and I could see her from the window. It was an old window that you had to use a stick or something to hold most of the windows up, not this one though, this one had a lock on it. Anyways, I'm a short kid so I was holding onto the window seal to see out of it. The window was up. I wasn't jumping or kicking or any sudden movements and the window unlocked and slammed down on my fingers. Bruised my hands up but luckily nothing was broken. \n\nThere was the basic foot steps, the TV would constantly and I mean constantly turn itself on and off, there was 3 knocks on the back door and no was was ever there, you could hear voices when no one was home &amp; my dog was petrified of the garage. He would rather stand outside in the rain and snow than go into the garage. \n\nI would have the most vivid and disturbing dreams in this house. Stuff that I don't want to  talk about because I legit have to talk about them in therapy. Just to sum everything up I was ALWAYS in danger and always running from something. \n\nOne night I was up hella late and it was pitch black in my room and I saw a fucking face creep up from behind the screen to around it. From what I remember it was pale and not too happy looking. I screamed because of how long I saw it and how slow it was moving towards me. Then it disappeared right front of my eyes. \n\nOne night I saw what I would call demons in the back yard by my swing set and I saw all kinds of weapons that idk if they even exist in real life, no guns tho and I saw something chewing on the swing set. The next day I went outside there were tons of bite/scratch marks that wouldn't have gotten there otherwise bc of the location. At first my mom thought I was talking about actual men in the backyard and not ghosts so she got out her Glock and got into shooting position lol. \n\nOh for whatever reason idk if I just had an over active imagination or what but I swear my stuffed animals with the plain black eyes used to move in my room. I'm not talking about moving from one spot to another when not looking, I'm talking about turning their heads and literally moving towards me. It was always at night in my dark room. It got so bad that I eventually didn't sleep with stuffed animals. \n\nOne night not long after my GMA died, I was laying awake looking up at the ceiling and I was sleeping in my mom's queen bed with her. There was a small drawer dresser to the left of the room, the queen size bed in the middle of the room, a long floorboard heater on the right wall with a window and right in front of the bed there was a big mirror dresser with about 3 feet of space from the dresser to the corner of the wall. Idk what caught my attention but I looked into the corner and lost it at what I was seeing. I saw a pale woman sitting in the corner leaned against the wall with long black hair and a blank expression. I screamed so loud my mom jumped out the bed. \n\nOne time my mom got home w some groceries and put them on the stove and it was turned off and everything caught on fire. \n\nMy neighbor used to say she could see things walking the border of our property lines from her bedroom window. \n\nThroughout the years the earth would unearth what we are pretty positive were human bones. \n \nLet me tell possibly the scariest night of all, that was the night we tried to finally leave the house. EVERY detail I'm about to share is 100% true. \nSo my mom and I were packing up a uhaul all day and at this point it was now 11pm-1am. We finished packing the truck and told the guys that helped us move that they could go ahead and go to the other house in the next city while we deal with the last few things we needed to pack in our car. My mom was very aware of the bad spirits there, so she told me to wait in her car. I watched from the front seat as my mom had a literal tug-of-war with the door. I watched it swing back and forth at least 3 times before my mom could shut the door completely. As she put her key in the lock the patio light above her head literally exploded and shattered above her head. Now we were in pitch dark. My mom ran to her car (that never had any issues at this point) and tried to start it but the battery was somehow dead! She had to run through my backyard to the neighbors house to get a jumper cable so we can leave. The feeling I had was horrible because it truly felt like whatever was on that land was trying their hardest to keep us there. Once my mom got the car jumped we officially left and never returned. \nThat was 10 years ago now and from what I can tell the house has switched between owners at least 4 times now. \n\nI was genuinely terrified of that house growing up and I believe it contributed to the years of bad mental health after leaving. I have more stories from the other homes I've lived in if I ever feel like writing them out. I swear nothing is fabricated. That's all I feel like typing for now. Ty for your time.",

        "text": "Thunder roared throughout the night  skies as I walked through the forest, struggling to see.  Lightning cracked,  and I could see but the faintest outline of a silhouette in the distance. Paranoia enveloped me at the sight. I quickly turned around and started to walk  at a brisk pace, desperately trying to leave the forest. Lightning struck the tree only a few dozen paces away from me, Illuminating the same silhouette, this time much closer and peeking behind the now burning tree.\n\nI froze in place from the pure shock and anxiety the situation had given me. Shivers ran through every inch of my body when the most uncomfortable and disturbing sensation of my neck being breathed upon, I screamed, and immediately after lightning struck once more, Illuminating the  sickening sight of a severely disfigured and horrifying face staring at me, just mere inches away. \n\nAdrenaline surged through my veins, and I swiftly turned around and ran for my life. I ignored the constant and painful scratches I was enduring from running through the thick forest on a rainy night. Lightning struck once more, now illuminating the face looking down at me from the sky, now tens of times larger.\n\nA cruel and deafening shriek left the face’s mouth, causing my ears pain. I didn’t stop running, though. Sure, it was clearly useless considering the fact it can obviously appear wherever it wants, whenever it wants, but *still*, I was not going to stand there and accept my fate. I ran because it was the only thing I could do, and I could *only* hope that running would somehow magically save my poor soul. \n\nLightning struck again, shining its bright light on the leaves on the ground, which were now covered with the same disfigured face I had become familiar with over the past five minutes. \n\n“*You… Must.Pay… For… Your… Sins…”*  the creature shrieked slowly. It’s voice  was uncanny and sounded like an alien lifeform imitating a human's voice as a cruel joke \n\n*What sins have I committed that would cause this?*\n\n*“You… Killed… Me…”*  The creature shrieked.\n\nI stopped running in my tracks.\n\n“WHO ARE YOU? HOW DID I KILL YOU?” I screamed before beginning to sob. \n\nMy brain clicked when I realized why I had been in the forest in the first place.\n\n*I was running away from something I had done.. But what?*\n\nI gasped a huge lungful of oxygen when the events that had happened 30 minutes prior came back to me all at once.\n\nIt was a confused blur of  getting behind the wheel drunk, hitting something, and instantly jumping out of the car and into the forest. \n\nLightning struck once more, illuminating the same face, but this time was different. I could now recognize the face clearly. It was me. The face staring back at me from the leaves was *my*  disfigured face.  \n\n*Oh.. Oh my god.*\n\nMy stomach threatened to empty itself after an intense wave of nausea washed over me. \n\n“*One… More… Chance…”* The creature shrieked again.\n\nSuddenly, my world began to spin  and morph, and then change into incomprehensible colors. In an instant, I was outside of the bar parking lot, severely drunk, and keys in hand. The note on the driver's side door handle caused me to sober up.\n\n“Make the right decision.”  the note read.\n\nI froze upon reading the note; it was my handwriting.  Impossibly, lightning struck to the left of me and I turned. I was met with the view of my disfigured self standing next to a street light. He saluted me and disappeared  into the night with a smile.\n\nI called an uber and arrived home. I found it incredibly odd that my family was not home at this ungodly hour. I sat down on my couch and pondered about the incredibly bizarre incident in the woods. Suddenly, My family came home.  They opened the door, Turned on the lights, and began to scream in what seemed like relieved terror.\n\n*“WE JUST SAW YOUR DEAD BODY ON THE FREEWAY HOW ARE YOU ALIVE?!”*  My mother screamed.  After hours of nonstop screaming and panicking, my family calmed down and were just grateful that I was alive. I woke up this morning and am still unable to fully comprehend the reality of last night. I decided to write it down here because I really needed to get this out..",

        "text": "I don’t know if anyone knows or was in the Lake Baikal area in the 1970s, but you have to believe me that this really did happen, my father worked for the Soviet Union on a project he NEVER told me and my mother about, I remember being very little, somewhere around 1975, and I found a greenish-grey rubber suit, which my father told me was for his “work” , which I now realize was a hazmat suit, similar to the ones the Chernobyl Liquidators wore, but now I can finally connect the dots, 40 years after the events my father MUST have had a part in.\n\nIn 1983, there was a farm north of Bratsk, owned by the Kremlin, which only grew some unknown flower no-one had ever seen in the area, or in the flower books found in the local library. In 1983, there was a local boy named Dmitri Borodin, who found a rusted gate without a padlock on the far side of the compound, if you will, and since I was in the same class as Dmitri we were relatively close friends, I went with him to explore.\n\nThe fields were full of flowers, a brighter blue than the sky or the ocean, and yet we saw no irrigators, no farmhands, not even a barn cat, just a bland house and rows upon rows of flowers, I would have to guess 2 square kilometers, as big as the Meteor Crater in Arizona, at least, but being foolish children we went in the house, where we found… nothing. It was as sterile as a laboratory, quieter than space itself. On the walls were nothing but pictures taken from a microscope, of what I now know as spores, electric blue as the flowers outside, which was not their only connection, but most importantly I found many Polaroid photos in a dark room in the house, which I still have, but I digress, they were horrible, depicting a column of fire, and a crater filled with the same flowers that bloomed outside, men walking through the fields wearing those yellow hazmat suits with gas masks on, a deer nearly just a skeleton with skin. A man being consumed by a blue rot, and that’s when I looked back at Dmitri. His face was starting to turn a shade of blue, pale blue mind you, but I saw these.. dots under his skin, tiny bumps like your taste buds, but it was then I connected the dots, the picture of the soldier, the deer, THE FLOWERS. I couldn’t don the hazmat suits, but thanks to many nuclear drills, I knew how to wear a gas mask, yet it was too late for Dmitri, if only I could have saved him. FUCK! His skin peeled of his face, and a mist of these fucking spores wafted out, him gargling on his own blood, I still hear those gurgles to this day. I ran so hard and so fast. But I left the gate open. \n\nThe flowers began to spread. To the town below. My father understood the implications of this, and the suits he used for “Work” were brought out of a locked cabinet in the garage, and I was told how to wear one, and a truck came to pick us up. I remember that day, August 28th, 1983. A truck marked with the Star of the Red Army came to pick us and the other personnel up. Even the driver was wearing one of those grey-green hazmat suits. There ended up being me, my mother, my father and another family. We were seated in the bed of this truck, a leftover surplus from the Great Patriotic War, driving through the streets. I saw hundreds dead. Some simply lying there like they had gone to sleep, all of them blue. But some were different. Some had their rib cages blown open like a grenade went off in them, pumping out those clouds of blue mist like it was exhaling. Some were barely recognizable as human, with elongated limbs, and a smooth, cerulean face. Some had branches sticking out of every spot on their body. Some seemed to be immune, but those that were were eating limbs of humans who were lucky enough to die before being overtaken. The man in the passenger seat of the YaG-10 shot these “People” on sight. I saw one of those king things blink. I swear to god I saw it blink. In those eyes I saw unimaginable pain, it looked like that thing’s soul was in hell, but it’s body was on earth. \n\nI went back there around 1995, after the fall of the Union, to see it myself, I had gear, everything. It wasn’t there, just some ash. They must have burnt the research village to the ground to destroy the spores. The farm was gone too. Me, and the children from those other families are the only ones who remember the Blue Plague. I can only hope whoever was in charge of that program shut it down, after seeing that, I have never slept without nightmares. The town was named Nomosk, it was around 90 Kilometers north of Bratsk, It was similar I believe, to the USA town of Oak Ridge, a town for researchers, masquerading as a normal town. There were constant army trucks and helicopters roaming the area, it wasn’t uncommon to see an Officer at the local bar, or a grunt a at the local post office. After the Plague of 1983, we were moved to Moscow, with my father receiving a large pension, and us living in an apartment. \n\nI remember a sign in the house though. “To prevent an apocalypse that could happen, take these steps: \n\n•Wear all safety gear. This minimizes exposure.\n•Report any erratic behavior in your fellow researcher, Spores have been shown to have a psychological impact.\n•Tell no one what happens here. Discourage rumors, tell people that it is simply a crop experiment.\n•Kill any intruder on sight, and cremate the remains. Spores can still asexually reproduce inside or a corpse.

        "text": " It’s never easy to start a new life, but I was looking forward to it. I regret it now. I should’ve stayed in New York. I wish I could go back in time and change everything. But it’s not possible.\n\nSo, we wanted to move far away from home with my wife. I found a very cheap house near a town called Harwich. I’d never heard of it before, and it was too cheap to be true, but it looked lovely in the pictures, and later I even visited it in person, and it seemed fine. \n\nIt was near the edge of a forest, there were no houses nearby, only the woods. Seemed like a great place, and we were delighted with it. We decided to move there.\n\nAs I was driving there when we finally decided to move, we were almost there, when my wife noticed a strange road sign on the side of the road.\n\n“Warning: You may see waving children nearby. Please wave back,” she read it to me. “What the fuck?”\n\n“Eh, probably just a prank,” I responded. A prank… I was so stupid.\n\n“Waving children,” she wondered. “Nobody lives nearby, why would…”\n\n“I don’t know, it’s probably nothing.”\n\nThe next two days went by quickly, we settled in, decorated the house, placed the furniture, etc. On Wednesday, we drove to Harwich to buy groceries and a few other things for the house. When we were driving back home, it was already dark.\n\nOnly the car’s headlights illuminated the road and the nearby trees. Then we saw it. On the side of the road, near the roads, we saw two children. A blonde little girl, and a black-haired boy. They were waving like crazy. And they were smiling. But it wasn’t a sweet smile, it was terrifying. It was so wide, it looked… unnatural.\n\n“I don’t know what’s going on,” I said, unconsciously slowing the car to get a better look.\n\n“Yeah, uhm- let’s just wave back,” my wife suggested. \n\nAnd so we waved. I was barely pressing the throttle, so we moved really slowly. As we got closer, we noticed a few things. They were in old, worn-out clothes. It looked like they were from the 19th century. \n\n“They have no eyes,” my wife noticed. “Honey, I’m scared.”\n\nShe wasn’t exactly right. The children had black eyes. Like, totally black, even though our headlights shined at them directly. She wasn’t the only one to freak out. I stopped waving and pressed the throttle to the floor, leaving them behind. We sat in the car silently until we arrived home. \n\n“I still can’t comprehend what we saw,” my wife said as we were packing the groceries into the house. “Did it really happen? Or were we just hallucinating?”\n\n“It was 100% real, I’m afraid,” I shook my head. “I think we should just stay home this late at night. Next time we’ll come back home earlier, and then maybe we won’t see them. Okay?”\n\n“Okay.”\n\nFrom that day, we always came back home before dark, and we were lucky to avoid those kids, but we still stared at that strange road sign every time we passed it. *WARNING,* with capitalized letters. *You may see waving children nearby.* The absurdity of this sentence has already freaked me out. But the next sentence was even more terrifying. *Please wave back!* Why? What happens if I don’t? \n\nA few weeks later, we stayed too much in Harwich. We met the Warren family, they were really kind and invited us for dinner. Jeremy Warren wanted to have a beer with me, but I had to drive home, so I refused his offer. \n\nIt was 11 PM when we were on the road home. We both felt uncomfortable in the car. We knew we’d made a mistake. We knew we would see the waving children on the side of the road. I was driving as fast as I could, pressing the throttle pedal with all my power. We saw the sign. *WARNING: You may see waving children nearby. Please wave back!*\n\nAnd about 50 meters later, we saw them. They were even more, my wife counted seven kids. I haven’t even looked at them. We didn’t wave. Oh, for fuck’s sake, we didn’t wave. I wasn’t that concerned about it then. I regret it now.\n\nWe arrived home, rushed into the house, and just stood in the kitchen like some idiots.\n\n“It was a bad idea to move here,” my wife said.\n\n“I’m sorry,” I sighed. “I knew it was too cheap. I should’ve known.”\n\n“No, it’s not your fault. The place is great, Harwich is great. The only problem is, you know, those creepy children.”\n\n“I don’t think it’s safe to stay there. We should move somewhere else.”\n\n“We can’t afford to move again.”\n\n“Maybe we can find some apartment in Harwich. Something cheap, but not as cheap as this.”\n\n“I don’t know. It’s not like they’re dangerous. They’re just kids, after all,” she said. She walked to the window and froze. She went pale. “Ho- honey, they’re here.”\n\nI rushed to the window. She was right. In front of our house, oh my god, it hurts to relive this memory. Dozens of children were in our courtyard. All in the same, old clothes, with their black eyes and wide smile. They were waving. They were fucking waving. \n\n“Let’s just… go to bed,” I said, trying to remain calm, which I wasn’t.\n\n“Are you crazy!?”\n\n*No, I’m calm,* I said to myself.\n\n“I know it’s strange, but they’re just… waving,” I took a deep breath. “They’ll be gone by tomorrow morning. Don’t worry.”\n\nShe agreed. I knew she was tired too. We moved away from the window and went to sleep. \n\n“Promise me nothing bad will happen,” she told me. \n\n“I promise. Tomorrow I’ll contact the police and tell them about this. You know officer Gregor, right? The cop we met yesterday. Or maybe we’ll ask the Warrens. Don’t worry. Everything will be fine. And I love you.”\n\nI fell asleep quickly, which was strange. I thought it would be a sleepless night because of those creepy kids around the house. *We didn’t wave back,* this was my last thought as I fell asleep.\n\nI woke up the next morning. Sun was already shining, I had a surprisingly good sleep. I looked to my right, and my wife wasn’t there. I thought maybe she was in the kitchen, making breakfast. Then I looked to the corner of the room.\n\nOn an old wooden chair was her dead body. She had her eyes cut out, there were deep cuts all over her body, and somebody, oh, for fuck’s sake, somebody had cut a wide smile on her face. And the worst part, she was waving. Her hands were tied to some steel rod that moved her hand. She was waving. She was waving.\n\nI screamed and ran out of the room. I couldn’t comprehend what had happened. I hoped I was crazy and all of it was just a hallucination. I hoped it was just a bad nightmare because of what had happened the previous night. I wanted to wake up.\n\n“I WANT TO WAKE UP,” I screamed at the top of my lungs. I didn’t wake up. It wasn’t a nightmare. It was reality. It all happened because we didn’t wave back. No, it all happened because I wanted the cheapest home I could find. I looked out the window. The children were still there, waving. At least a hundred of them. So I waved back. I waved back.

        "text": "You'd think I wouldn't be able to sleep after having the literal Devil house under my bed, but I actually found the part of the night that followed very restful. Maybe all the excitement had exhausted me. To my surprise, no alarm clock rang me out of bed the following day. I was tickled awake by the gentle rays of winter sunlight falling in through my window. I admittedly felt a little like a Disney princess. Someone had drawn the curtains open and tucked my blanket closer around me—I noticed it as soon as I opened my eyes. A fuzzy warmth spread in my chest as I swung my legs out of bed and started climbing into my dress. Traipsing down the stairs, I was met with the delicious smell of pancakes. This was… suspiciously pleasant.\n\nUpon entering the kitchen, I found Cas waiting for me, holding out a loaded plate.\n\n\"You made breakfast?\" \n\nHis shoulders drooped. \"I was feeling really guilty for how I blew you off yesterday,\" he admitted sheepishly. \"And then I had a really sad, creepy nightmare where you were standing across from me and you were looking at me with your eyes all white and you were crying, and I wanted to comfort you but then all of my teeth fell out… Anyway, I went to wake you up but you looked so peaceful… I ended up turning off your alarm. Figured you'd need the rest. I've already checked up on the morning shift. Everyone seems to be doing alright, although we *will* need a replacement for Hayes sooner rather than later.\"\n\n\"Didn't you meet some folks who were interested in working here a little while ago? You know, when you went to town.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but I don't know if we ought to be conducting interviews at a time like this,\" he argued.\n\n\"We're gonna have to. We don't have to do it here. We could do it somewhere public. There's a diner there that's not so bad, right?\" \n\n\"That might work.\" A sparkle returned to Cas' eyes as he proceeded to douse my pancakes in syrup. \"I hope it was okay that I came into your room. I was missing you a lot. I know that makes me sound like a baby, but—\"\n\n\"But what are you gonna do,\" I interrupted him casually. \"Sweetie, you're not Jem. And you used to hang out in my room all the time.\" I set my plate down on the kitchen table and proceeded to tell him about Nick's visit the night prior. Casimir was shocked, but I assured him that I wasn't letting the Devil's mind games get to me. \n\n\"So aside from that, we've potentially been sitting on what, an eldritch horror that's sleeping somewhere on our property?\" he clarified.\n\n\"Seems like it. But on the plus side, all Nick asked me to do is *locate* it. Not to wake it up, not to make contact, just to locate it.\" I shrugged. \"I think I can do that.\"\n\n\"I can run some job interviews on the side!\" my little brother offered readily. \n\n\"I'd appreciate it, but, like… elephant in the room, what do we do about Dad?\" \n\nCasimir fell silent. \"I seriously don't know. But I'll try to come up with something, I promise. You can't waste your energy worrying about him right now. It's been bad enough for you as of late. I want… I *need* you to be okay. I'm scared for you. Anyone else would have probably gone insane by now.\"\n\nI smiled, waving him off. \"Surely not *anyone…*\" \n\n\"Fi, that wasn't some sort of compliment. I think you're *literally* at risk of losing your mind,\" he said sternly. \"Look, I'll try to take care of the Dad-situation. You, do what Nick asked. If we keep him happy, he'll uphold the deal with the huldufólk. Besides, I really don't want him to be pissed at us. He freaks me the fuck out.\"\n\n\"I know what you mean.\" Squirming in my seat, I tried to meet Cas' pale green gaze. \"Okay, I'm not sure if I should be telling you this, but Nick… He kind of *likes* you. He says that once you die, you'll become one of those demons who torture the sinners in Lust. Is that something you wanna do, by any chance?\"\n\nFrom the disgusted look on his face, I could tell that it was probably not. Casimir seemed to be genuinely repulsed by the idea, but his answer was rather level-headed. \"I kinda… I guess I knew. I honestly don't know if I can even change that. And I wouldn't even know how to start trying.\"\n\n\"Maybe not knock up every other girl you meet?\"\n\nHe let out a dry chuckle. \"Yeah, that'd be a start. But that's something I've been meaning not to do anymore either way. Fi… I'm not a monster.\"\n\n\"I know.\" I quietly cut off a part of my pancake stack. \"Hey, um… Jeremy said some pretty concerning things. About how you'd understand what he'd done, if you were real with yourself. And that *it was different* for you guys. Any chance you could tell me what he meant by that?\"\n\nCasimir shook his head. \"Jem's crazy. Yes, I know what he's talking about, but it's bullshit. Of course we had a shit time as kids, but that doesn't mean you're allowed to go and kill people.\"\n\n\"A shit time?\" I repeated quizzically.\n\nCas let go of a deep, ragged breath. \"It's about mom. I think. See, mom was really pretty sucky. Not to you, of course, because she loved *you*, but us? Especially us boys? Well. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to describe it, except for cold. Okay, I feel shitty just saying that. I loved Mom, but…\"\n\n\"It's okay. Tell me.\"\n\n\"Alright, so… My personal experience was that I could never do anything right in her mind. You know I was pretty good at school, right? She didn't care. I came to her one summer with all As and she just brushed me off. Whenever I tried to talk to her, she'd do this thing where she'd nod along and pretend to listen but actually didn't; that just made me feel stupid. But I don't wanna whine or anything. She had good days, too. Sometimes, she was really sweet. That'd just make me feel confused.\"\n\nMy little brother heaved a sigh. \"She'd get really angry with me everytime I did something wrong. Something small was enough. I'd knock over a glass and spill water and she'd blow up at me, or I'd accidentally break a dish and she wouldn't talk to me for days. Like, she'd literally pretend I didn't exist. I felt… worthless. I know I shouldn't be complaining. She kept me fed and well-dressed and everything…\"\n\n\"That's just keeping your base needs covered. You're still allowed to be unhappy with how she treated you,\" I replied. \"Dad kept me fed, too, and he fucking hated me. You wouldn't believe how much shit I did just to get a rise out of him. He was always angry with me, and it was like whenever we were alone, he would *actively* try to… I don't know, take me down a peg? Like, one time, he was driving me to the doctor's office because I'd caught this really bad cold—that was when I was around fifteen, I think. And the whole drive, he just kept on insulting me. He literally called me names. And I hadn't spoken the entire time, I was just trying to tune him out.\"\n\n\"Fuck. Dad was really like that to you? I mean, I knew you didn't get along at all, but I always thought… hell, I don't even know what I thought.\" He snorted. \"I can't believe those were the same two people we're talking about. Dad was always in my corner as a kid. He was there for me, he comforted me, he taught me a bunch of stuff… He just *saw* me, does that make sense? He was on *my* side.\"\n\n\"I just wish there hadn't been sides,\" I said softly.\n\n\"Yeah. I think it was even worse for Jeremy. But then again, he was always really fucking weird. Honestly, I should have known he'd turn into something like this. There were a couple things I noticed, and, well… I never said anything. He told me not to, in fact, he basically threatened me once. For some reason, I actually only remembered that yesterday.\"\n\n\"What kind of things did he do?\" I asked hesitantly.\n\nCas squirmed in his seat, hiding his face by bringing his coffee mug to his lips. \"You wouldn't wanna know. I shouldn't have brought it up. Maybe I'm remembering it wrong, too. Nevermind. So what's your plan for today?\"\n\nDeciding not to press the matter, I leaned back, sliding aside my by then empty plate. \"I'm gonna go talk to the Bannik. He's bound to be able to help me out.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I reckon he'd know about this,\" Casimir said comfortably, his posture straightening as a smile returned to his face. \"Guess I'm gonna see what I can do in regards to new hires. And Dad, of course.\"\n\n\"Appreciate it.\" I stood up, reaching out to gather the dirty dishes in my arms, but my brother stopped me. \n\n\"Leave it to me.\"\n\nI nodded, then went to pick up two bars of scented soap from my cupboard. A couple gifts never go wrong with the Bannik. \n\nThe snow had been piling up outside overnight. Glistening white covered the rooftops of the house, the stables and the sauna. Thick fog hung languidly over the red meadow, making the trees behind it appear like phantoms rising from the mist. Ominous. Breathtakingly beautiful.\n\nThe spirit of the sauna answered my knocking and request for entry almost right away. He gratefully accepted my offering and listened intently as I stated my purpose. \n\n*\"What you're asking of me is no simple task of divination,\"* he gibbered. *\"But I know what you’re looking for, and it can be done. Do come in.\"*\n\nSmiling gratefully, I stepped inside. The Bannik scurried over to the wooden bucket of water in the corner and proceeded to drag it into the middle of the room. I watched as he draped his arms around it. To my wonder, the water began to steam and bubble. The spirit dropped one of my soaps into the boiling bucket and then motioned for me to come closer. *\"Your bloodline is a strong one, heiress. Your family has come a long way, and your past still echoes across this land. I can help you see memories that aren't yours, if you provide me with a drop of your blood. It will act as a key, or a conduit, if you will.\"*\n\nI nodded eagerly, pulling out my pocket knife and readily pricking the tip of my index finger. Ignoring the slight sting of pain, I squeezed out a bead of red and allowed it to drip into the bucket at the Bannik's instructions. The water seemed to boil even more furiously, turning a deep, dark red. I shrank back, the sight slightly unsettling. \"What now?\" I stammered uncertainly.\n\n*\"You'll have to dip your head in.\"*\n\n\"What? I can't do that! It's gonna burn my face off!\"\n\n*\"That won't be a problem. There is something else you'll need to worry about, though. This isn't perfectly safe. Keep your wits about you. You'll see things, and if you stay in the water for too long, there's a possibility you might feel… an influence.\"*\n\n\"An influence?\"\n\n*\"I don't rightly know what else to call it. A highly unpleasant side effect. You could go… well, mad, for lack of a better word. But I'll know when to stop you, and I will pull you up when it's time. You may rely on me.\"*\n\n\"Do I want to?\" I asked, nervous fingertips tracing the wood lines on the bucket.\n\n*\"It is your choice alone. But I do believe it would be of great importance for you to see. It could establish a connection between you and your ancestors. That could be useful considering your… predicament.\"*\n\nI regarded him with narrowed eyes. \"And I can trust you with this?\"\n\n*\"I so swear. What good would it do me to kill my own warden?\"*\n\nI nodded slowly. Then, I took in a deep, steadying breath before pressing my eyes shut and plunging face-first into the bucket. I really did feel no pain. The water bubbling around me was pleasantly warm, even. I could feel my hair being cautiously drawn up behind my head, and I smiled to myself when I realized that the Bannik was holding it up for me. Readying myself for whatever was about to happen, I opened my eyes. To my surprise, this, too, didn't hurt. I didn't even feel the need to breathe. For a moment, I couldn't see a thing. Then, all of a sudden, my mind was flooded with images.\n\nEverything I saw and felt was different, wholly different. It took me a few seconds to realize that this wasn't actually happening. These were simply memories; an experience belonging to somebody else. I wasn't in the steaming room anymore, I wasn't in my woods at all; hell, I wasn't even in my own body. \n\nI was a man on a horse, riding at the front of a long trek. \n\nWalking behind me were roughly a dozen creatures of various shapes and sizes. Some stood upright while others prowled on all fours, some had faces while others had snouts; those aquatic brings who could not go on foot were being pulled along in a large basin on wheels or carried in jars. In front of me on the horse, nestled between my legs, sat a little boy. He was playing with the mane of my horse, braiding and twisting it while whistling a small tune to pass the time. Twigs and leaves were sticking out of his unruly, dark brown hair. Two short, fuzz-covered branches pierced his scalp on either side—nubs that would one day become large, majestic antlers. \n\nOnce he got older, he'd surely be able to shift into a more defined human form instead of this (admittedly adorable) mixed-up body. I had yet to see him take on his primal, likely more monstrous appearance. It couldn't be that big and scary, considering his young age, but I had a feeling he was hiding it in order to appeal to my own human paternal instincts. I didn't want to embarrass the proud little thing by bringing it up, though. The child would grow into a powerful creature, but as he was now, he was abandoned, hurt and in need of protection.\n\nNormally, a Leshy would be raised in the woods he was to rule upon maturing. The offspring of another Leshy and a swamp Kikimora, his purpose in life would have been to become the new woodland guardian once his father died. I had found the boy at a crossroads, all by his lonesome and in obvious distress. When I'd asked about his territory and kin, he'd just started crying and wailing like a dying animal. That had settled it for me; he was going to come with us. I figured he was like the majority of the others—a fugitive, chased out of his natural habitat by the believers, the self-proclaimed saints who intended to purify grounds that weren't theirs to claim by hunting down the spirits that reside upon them. \n\nI had never been a man of God, but I could understand their fear. Still, I didn't want the ancients to die. That's why I was doing what I did. Looking for a new home for these beings. I turned my head to look at the man riding alongside me. His steed was pale as death itself, his sallow fingers clutching the reins with steely resolve. Despite the bags under his eyes and the sweat and grease that made his black hair look like a bird's nest, he seemed to be holding up well enough. \n\n\"Is it still following us?\" I asked, speaking in a language I, Fiona, did not know, but I, the rider, had been born into. \n\n\"Yes,\" the man replied curtly, his voice deep and gruff. \n\n\"Is it close?\" \n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Are you regretting this?\"\n\nA shrug. Egon Hettmann was a silent fellow. Still, the brief smile he threw me assured me that he hadn't lost faith in our mission just yet. \n\n\"Um… Arek?\" a tiny voice piped up. The boy in my lap had turned to face me, his eyes wide. \n\nI didn't have to ask what he'd meant to turn my attention to. Something was covering the sky, the hills, the trees up ahead. I could not for the life of me find the words to describe it. The sight in itself was so foreign, so unnatural and alien that it stole the breath from my throat. The little boy started whimpering, and soon, his sobs turned into full-on weeping as he pressed his face to my chest. I placed my palm against the back of his head, somehow managing to stammer out gentle whispers of comfort that utterly failed in their effect seeing as I, too, was beyond terrified. \n\n\"Is it alive? Is that the thing? Is it?\" the child whined, grabbing at my sleeves as if trying to pull them around himself. \n\n\"Yes,\" I said softly.\n\n\"Why won't it leave us alone?\" he wailed.\n\n\"I don't know, little one,\" I replied.\n\n\"It's not moving,\" Egon remarked, sounding deeply unsettled but trying to hide it. \"Could we… go around it somehow?\"\n\n\"I don't know that we can,\" I answered pensively. \"It's… it's gigantic.\" It was hard not to lose face considering what we were looking at. Normally, with the creatures we'd already encountered, it had been easy to come off of the shock after a moment. They'd resemble humans or animals just enough for me to always keep my composure, to always stand tall and either talk to them or convince them to leave me and my party alone with brawn or the miller's black magic. Or, of course, to join us.\n\nThis thing, though, was completely unfamiliar, beyond description, beyond comprehension. It was impossible to tell if it had needs or wants or instincts, or what in the world they were, if it did. It was shapeless, shimmering in a strange mix of dusky hues. It wasn't even corporeal, it just seemed to stand in the sky like the sunset. Despite all this, it seemed to radiate a certain sentience, an intent that I couldn't fathom.\n\n\"Egon, you have to know something about this,\" I whispered.\n\nHe merely shook his head, eyes still trained on the thing. \"I swear I don't. I'd tell you if I did, but I got nothing.\" He sounded almost astounded, and I don't know what disturbed me more—the fact that a worshipper of the Devil didn't know what nameless horror this thing was, or that he was visibly scared of it. \n\n\"Arek!\" the tiny Leshy in my arms cried out. \"It's coming closer, I can feel it! It's coming!\"\n\nIn the real world, I, Fiona, was pulled out of the water, emerging with a gasp. The Bannik moved to my front, regarding me with probing eyes.\n\n*\"What did you see?\"*\n\nFor a while, all I could do was stare at him. My throat had gone bone dry. \"I'll be right back.\" With that, I scrambled to my feet and staggered out the door.\n\nMy head was reeling, my cheeks flushed. The cold winter air hit my wet skin, almost piercing in its chill. I sucked it in, taking deep, frantic breaths. My mind was running wild, it was all over the place—I looked down at my hands, confused at the sight of my slender, pale fingers instead of the rider's long, calloused ones. \n\n*Fuck.*\n\nThis was what the Bannik had warned me of, wasn't it? He was still there, the rider was still in my head—I didn't feel like I was *me.* A name kept echoing through my thoughts. Arkadiusz. Arek. The traveler. The helmsman of the inhuman procession. His blood was in my veins. Diluted, yes, but somehow stronger than ever. At that moment, it seemed to be boiling. And then, the ground began to shake.\n\nI froze in place.\n\nThe snow looked like it was vibrating, quivering and trembling as if the earth beneath was getting goosebumps. This was not my imagination—as I shot a glance over at the house, I saw the door being thrown open. Cas appeared on the stoop, eyes wide with terror. Within a second, he was at my side, shaking me by the shoulders as if the earthquake wasn't doing so quite forcefully enough for his liking. \n\n\"What's happening?\" he shouted.\n\nFor once, I was speechless. My heart sank when I heard screams ring out from beyond the treeline—my guards. Aleksei. Where were they? I willed myself to calm, trying to ward off the fog of panic. \"I don't know!\" I cried out. Then my gaze wandered over to the red meadow. Once more, I fell silent. \"Look,\" I said under my breath. Cas turned his head to follow my stare. \n\nSwirling colors were hovering over the plain, like simmering heat in the summer. The air seemed to *ripple* and quail. I apologize for the lackluster description, but I simply can't seem to put the sight into words. It instilled within me a fear similar to the one I'd felt upon seeing Nick for the first time. What I was looking at was unfathomable, and yet, however impossibly, *alive*. Unable to contain his horror, Casimir let out a sharp yell, half of which died in his throat.

        "text": "I don’t know if anyone knows or was in the Lake Baikal area in the 1970s, but you have to believe me that this really did happen, my father worked for the Soviet Union on a project he NEVER told me and my mother about, I remember being very little, somewhere around 1975, and I found a greenish-grey rubber suit, which my father told me was for his “work” , which I now realize was a hazmat suit, similar to the ones the Chernobyl Liquidators wore, but now I can finally connect the dots, 40 years after the events my father MUST have had a part in, you see, in 1983, there was a farm north of Bratsk, owned by the Kremlin, which only grew some unknown flower no-one had ever seen in the area, or in the flower books found in the local library. In 1983, there was a local boy named Dmitri Borodin, who found a rusted gate without a padlock on the far side of the compound, if you will, and since I was in the same class as Dmitri we were relatively close friends, I went with him to explore, the fields were full of flowers, a brighter blue than the sky or the ocean, and yet we saw no irrigators, no farmhands, not even a barn cat, just a bland house and rows upon rows of flowers, I would have to guess 2 square kilometers, as big as the Meteor Crater in Arizona, at least, but being foolish children we went in the house, where we found… nothing. It was as sterile as a laboratory, quieter than space itself. On the walls were nothing but pictures taken from a microscope, of what I now know as spores, electric blue as the flowers outside, which was not their only connection, but most importantly I found many Polaroid photos in a dark room in the house, which I still have, but I digress, they were horrible, depicting a column of fire, and a crater filled with the same flowers that bloomed outside, men walking through the fields wearing those yellow hazmat suits with gas masks on, a deer nearly just a skeleton with skin. A man being consumed by a blue rot, and that’s when I looked back at Dmitri. His face was starting to turn a shade of blue, pale blue mind you, but I saw these.. dots under his skin, tiny bumps like your taste buds, but it was then I connected the dots, the picture of the soldier, the deer, THE FLOWERS. I couldn’t don the hazmat suits, but thanks to many nuclear drills, I knew how to wear a gas mask, yet it was too late for Dmitri, if only I could have saved him. FUCK! His skin peeled of his face, and a mist of these fucking spores wafted out, him gargling on his own blood, I still hear those gurgles to this day. I ran so hard and so fast. But I left the gate open. The flowers began to spread. To the town below. My father understood the implications of this, and the suits he used for “Work” were brought out of a locked cabinet in the garage, and I was told how to wear one, and a truck came to pick us up. I remember that day, August 28th, 1983. A truck marked with the Star of the Red Army came to pick us and the other personnel up. Even the driver was wearing one of those grey-green hazmat suits. There ended up being me, my mother, my father and another family. We were seated in the bed of this truck, a leftover surplus from the Great Patriotic War, driving through the streets. I saw hundreds dead. Some simply lying there like they had gone to sleep, all of them blue. But some were different. Some had their rib cages blown open like a grenade went off in them, pumping out those clouds of blue mist like it was exhaling. Some were barely recognizable as human, with elongated limbs, and a smooth, cerulean face. Some had branches sticking out of every spot on their body. Some seemed to be immune, but those that were were eating limbs of humans who were lucky enough to die before being overtaken. The man in the passenger seat of the YaG-10 shot these “People” on sight. I saw one of those king things blink. I swear to god I saw it blink. In those eyes I saw unimaginable pain, it looked like that thing’s soul was in hell, but it’s body was on earth. I went back there around 1995, after the fall of the Union, to see it myself, I had gear, everything. It wasn’t there, just some ash. They must have burnt the research village to the ground to destroy the spores. The farm was gone too. Me, and the children from those other families are the only ones who remember the Blue Plague. I can only hope whoever was in charge of that program shut it down, after seeing that, I have never slept without nightmares. The town was named Nomosk, it was around 90 Kilometers north of Bratsk, It was similar I believe, to the USA town of Oak Ridge, a town for researchers, masquerading as a normal town. There were constant army trucks and helicopters roaming the area, it wasn’t uncommon to see an Officer at the local bar, or a grunt a at the local post office. After the Plague of 1983, we were moved to Moscow, with my father receiving a large pension, and us living in an apartment. I remember a sign in the house though. “To prevent the apocalypse that could happen, take these steps: \n\n•Wear all safety gear. This minimizes exposure.\n•Report any erratic behavior in your fellow researcher, Spores have been shown to have a psychological impact.\n•Tell no one what happens here. Discourage rumors, tell people that it is simply a crop experiment.\n•Kill any intruder on sight, and cremate the remains. Spores can still asexually reproduce inside or a corpse. Human or Animal.\n\nI still have the Polaroids, I’m working on digitizing them, they’re an old Soviet brand from the late 1970s, I don’t even know if they made it outside the RSFSR",

        "text": "I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, counting the minutes as they ticked by. I couldn't shake the feeling of restlessness that had been creeping over me all evening. I had tossed and turned for hours, but sleep seemed like a distant dream. I knew that if I didn't get some rest soon, the next day would be a struggle. But try as I might, my mind wouldn't shut off. It was as if something was calling to me, drawing me out of my bed and into the night.\n\nMy mind races with thoughts of work, relationships, and everything in between. It's another sleepless night, and I can't help but feel as though something is missing. I glance around my room, taking in the familiar surroundings. My dresser, my TV, my closet. It all seems so mundane, so uninspiring. I can't shake the feeling that I'm trapped in a rut. I glance at the clock, it's only 1:00 AM. I know I won't be able to fall asleep now, so I decide to take a walk.\n\nThe atmosphere outside was one of complete and utter emptiness. The moon was full, casting a pale light across the deserted streets. The only sound was the crunching of gravel beneath my feet as I walked. The darkness surrounds me like a thick blanket, suffocating and oppressive. The streetlights flicker above me, casting strange shadows on the pavement. The houses on either side of me are dark and empty, giving off an unsettling feeling. The air is thick with a damp mist that clings to my skin, making it feel clammy. I try to shake off the feeling of unease, but it clings to me like the mist. I have the sudden urge to turn back, but my restless mind won't let me. I begin to walk, my footsteps echoing in the empty streets. I can't help but feel like I'm the only one alive in this ghost town. The night seems to stretch on forever…\n\nAs I walked through the empty streets, I couldn't shake the feeling of unease. The darkness seemed to press in on me from all sides, and the silence was deafening. I tried to focus on the sound of my own footsteps, but even they seemed to echo unnaturally.\n\nAs I turned down a particularly dark alley, I couldn't help but notice the twisted shadows on the wall. They seemed to writhe and contort, as if they were alive. I quickened my pace, but the shadows seemed to follow me, their twisted forms growing ever more grotesque.\n\nI soon found myself in a rundown part of town, where the buildings seemed to lean in on me. The windows were boarded up, and the streets were littered with debris. I could hear strange noises coming from the shadows, but whenever I turned to look, there was nothing there.\n\nI felt like I was being watched, and my heart was pounding in my chest. I couldn't shake the feeling that something was following me. I knew I should have turned back, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. I had to keep walking, even as the darkness deepened and the creatures lurking in the shadows seemed to grow more and more ominous. \n\nThe darkness seemed to swallow everything in its path, leaving nothing but an empty void around me. I tried to focus on the sound of my footsteps, but they were drowned out by the eerie silence that hung in the air. Suddenly, I saw her. A long, tall woman with long black hair that covered her face. She was standing still, staring at me with an intensity that made my blood run cold. I couldn't help but feel that looking at her directly would only worsen my state of mind, so I kept my gaze fixed on the ground and quickened my pace. But no matter how fast I walked, I could feel her eyes following me, watching my every move. I knew that I had to get out of there, but something kept me from running. Fear had rooted me to the spot, and all I could do was continue my walk, trying to ignore the feeling of dread that was growing inside me.\n\nAs I continued my walk, the darkness seemed to deepen around me. The streets were empty, and the only sound was the soft echo of my footsteps. Suddenly, I caught a glimpse of something out of the corner of my eye. I turned to see a towering figure, at least eight feet tall, with deep red eyes that seemed to burn into my soul. Its skin was stitched together, and its mouth was stretched into a grotesque grin. I felt a chill run down my spine, but I forced myself to keep walking, trying to put as much distance between myself and the creature as I could. But the further I walked, the more the creature seemed to be following me. I could feel its presence looming behind me, always just out of sight. I knew I should be running, but my feet wouldn't move any faster. I couldn't shake the feeling that if I turned around, I would be trapped in its gaze forever.\n\nAs I trudged through the darkness, the mist began to roll in, enveloping me in a thick, eerie fog. The air was heavy and damp, and I could barely see more than a few feet in front of me. The only thing that kept me going was the sound of my own footsteps, the only thing that kept me company was the sound of the eerie silence. It was ironic, the same eerie silence I had dreaded so much was now my only company. I couldn't see anything, only the mist, and it was as if I was walking into an endless abyss. The sound of the silence was deafening, and I couldn't help but feel that something was watching me. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was not alone. The mist seemed to be alive, and it seemed to be closing in on me, as if it was trying to swallow me whole. The only thing that kept me going was the knowledge that I could not turn back, and so I walked on, into the unknown.\n\nAs I stumbled through the dark, eerie streets, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The mist that rolled in from the nearby lake seemed to cling to my skin, making me feel as though I was being suffocated. The sounds that surrounded me were equally unsettling—distant whispers, twisted laughter, and the soft shuffling of unseen feet.\n\nBut it was the children that truly sent chills down my spine. I saw them out of the corner of my eye, playing in a circle on the sidewalk ahead. Their faces were twisted and distorted, their eyes and mouths stretched in grotesque ways. I couldn't help but approach them, my curiosity getting the better of me.\n\n“What are you kids doing out so late?” I asked, trying to sound nonchalant. But as they turned to face me, I realized that their twisted features weren't just a trick of the light. These children were something otherworldly.\n\nThey began to circle me, their twisted faces inches from mine. I could feel their hot breath on my skin, could hear the low growls that emanated from their throats. And then, as one, they let out a blood-curdling scream.\n\nI fell to my knees, hands clapped over my ears, as the screams seemed to go on forever. I could feel my hearing slipping away, my mind shutting down in the face of such overwhelming terror. And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, it was over.\n\nI opened my eyes to find that daylight was creeping in, casting the once-haunting streets in a new light. I couldn't help but wonder what would have happened if I had stopped to question the other creatures I had seen on my night walk. But I knew deep down that I never wanted to find out.",

        "text": "I’ll keep this short and sweet. A few years back, we were having a brutally cold winter. The snow had frozen into ice and covered everything. It was pitch black in the backyard when I went to let my dog outside one last time before bed that evening. As we exited the house from the sliding door of the walkout basement and onto the lower deck, I felt that something was off. Our house backs up to some woods, so I was accustomed to hearing noises from wildlife in the night. This night was different. Nothing made a sound except the arctic cold wind, but I had the feeling I was being watched. The entire time my dog was in the backyard, I looked around nervously, expecting a coyote or other predator to pop out of the tree line. My dog did his business, but afterward stopped and stared at a corner of the woods until I got creeped out and called him back inside. I quickly locked the sliding door and shut the curtains, unable to shake the uneasy feeling I had outside. After double and triple checking all the locks in the house, I went to bed. \n\nAround 3:00 in the morning, I hear the muffled sound of my dog barking from the basement two floors below. I got up, stumbled down three flights of stairs and found him standing at the basement sliding door. He was peeking his head through the closed curtains, barking his head off with the hairs standing up all along his back. I tried calling him away from the door, but he wouldn’t let up. I dreaded peeking out the curtain to see what he was barking at after the uneasy feeling I had earlier in the night. Finally, I held my breath and swiped the curtain aside. I peered into the inky blackness, but saw nothing to cause any alarm. A wave of relief washed over me. \n\nI figured it must’ve been a deer or raccoon in the yard that set him off. He whined at the door for a few more minutes until I bribed him upstairs with a dog cookie. I went back to bed and wasn’t disturbed again. That is, until the morning when I went to the basement to let out the dog. I opened the sliding door and walked out onto the deck as he bounded into the snow. My blood ran as cold as the subzero morning temperatures when I looked down. There, frozen into the ice on the deck, was a set of bare human footprints. They were very clear; I could make out each toe on the person’s foot. The prints were large and appeared to be from an adult male. Looking around, I noticed they started at the base of the deck, went to the sliding door and the window of the basement living room, then seemed to disappear off the side of the deck. I had my snow boots on, so I walked around the yard but I could find no trace of the footprints in the snow once they left the deck. \n\nKeep in mind the daily temperatures that winter barely made it above 0 F, and the wind chill made it feel close to 20 below. Frostbite would set in within a matter of minutes for anyone walking around barefoot, especially in the dead of night. I never experienced anything like that again, but I did adopt a second dog shortly thereafter.",

        "text": "This post is mostly AI generated. I stepped in and guided it at points, but InferKit did the majority of the heavy lifting. Enjoy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCourt documents have revealed that famous rapper, \"Young Thug\" is in possession of an ancient staff which holds unknown power. The rapper is now facing serious charges after admitting to the killing of a man by stomping on his neck while wearing a gold crown and cloak, reports The Independent.\n\nHis whereabouts have been unknown since the 25th of January, when he mysteriously disappeared from the room while on trial. He has been occasionally sighted in public, usually in secluded, dark areas such as behind a tree-line and in the sewers. He has been linked to the disappearance of several people in the past, but no one has been able to prove that he is responsible for any of these crimes.\n\nOne witness claimed to have seen Young Thug coming out of a park with a body covered in cement and concrete, claiming that Young Thug killed him by stomping on his neck while wearing a gold crown and cloak. The rapper then took the dead man to the back of the park and ran away before driving off in a car. The court documents do not detail the specific nature of the supposed murder, nor are they giving any indication as to why he was wearing such a strange outfit.\n\nPeople were shocked when the supposedly missing rapper released an album on the 18th of February, 2018. The album was a 458 video long production called \"Bebezeek\" and rather than featuring actual music, instead featured the rapper reciting chants in an unknown language whilst pursuing victims in secluded areas. Eventually, Young Thug would catch up to his victim and the video would cut off.

        "text": "Prelude:\n\nOn September 6th, 2022, William Barnett was hospitalized for a severe case of insomnia, and severely damaged retina. Official reports conducted an investigation fearing a potentially unknown toxin. Upon a sweep of Mr. Barnett's home, no toxins were found. Instead, a journal. Desperate for leads investigators read through Mr. Barnett's journal. Transcribed below are pages 73-82 of said journal.  \n\n\nAbstract:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't sleep.\n\nI just, can't sleep.\n\nThe sun goes down, and my heart rate relaxes. Safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor now, I'm safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been, five days, I think? It's getting hard to tell. I've never been one to suffer insomnia before. The last sleep I had was also the cause of this episode. It was a dream that I had. I was sitting next to a baby's crib. Holding a book in my hands. The room was dark and the baby was looking up at me, expectantly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know why but the gaze of that child felt wrong. Like I wasn't meant to be anywhere near them, but at the same time. I knew they were my child. I steadied myself in their gaze, sweat forming on  forehead, and with a gulp, I swallowed that feeling and raised the book up to start reading. The cover of the book looked to be of two men standing outside in a field during mid day. They were dressed like wizards, with long blue robes and an absurd hat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey held wands and appeared to be casting some sort of spell aimed directly at the sun. But, honestly it could have been anything as it looked as though a child had drawn it. The title read, \"The Wizards, And The Sun.\" I began reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong long ago, there lived a man, he was happy and cheerful, and full of life. Everyone in his village loved him, and everything was alright. There was also another man, who's life was not as nice. He was crass and mean and grumpy and nobody liked him. The two men lived in the same small village, yet knew nothing of each other. Their minds were both sharp and bright. But one day, the two men crossed paths. Walking down a street in opposite directions. The first man let out a cheerful hello, and the second a quiet grunt.\n\nAnd on any other day, that would be that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut as they passed each other, something special happened. Something that has only ever happened a few times before. Their lives got flipped around. The happy man was sad and the sad man was happy. Neither had any explanation for their sudden change in attitude. Neither could stop thinking about that encounter. Despite having no proof, they both knew this change had to be because, of them. But they did not know why or how.\n\nBoth men searched high and low for each other. One looked down one street the other, another. Just out of reach. And eventually they had resigned themselves to not finding them, adjusted to their new attitude and moved on. And on any other day, that would be that. But by sheer coincidence, on the same path, at the same time of day, they found each other again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second man let out a cheerful hello and the first let out a quiet grunt. They almost didn't notice. But then, they gasped. And finally, introduced themselves. Turns out they were a lot alike. They liked the same things, they had the same interests, and better yet, they had the same name!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey were like a vibrating string. One a high point, the other a low one. But just like that string, they played the same note. Like a part of their soul, was embedded in the other. The only thing that differed, about these two men, were their view of the world. The first man who had lived so cheerful, thought it a wonderful place where good men were common and bad men were the exception.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConversely the second man thought the opposite. Bad men were common and good men were the exception. They debated for hours on end, about who was right. But no matter what they tried, they were never any closer to reaching a compromise. Until they reached an epiphany.\n\n*It did not matter what they thought.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir interpretations were what mattered. The first man lived happily, his outlook was bright, and there existed no room for misery. But upon becoming miserable himself. He could see, so clearly the flaws in his thoughts. That goodness couldn't ever affect everyone that darkness always lurked near the edges of our vision. The second man argued with his new cheery outlook that it was meaningless staring into the dark.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat to do so, would lead only to more of it. They stared at each other for a long while. And came to the conclusion. That both men, were right. That the world they lived in, was one where good and bad men, existed. And there was no compromise. They saw a world, two worlds, in fact! But divided, by love and hate. Both aware of each other. Yet ignorant that perspective was all that mattered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd so, they hatched a most devious plan.\n\nTheir sharp minds lead them down a path. They would need a fool. A lynchpin. Two, in fact. The first man would talk, and talk about love, and hate, right and wrong, glorious heavens, and miserable hells. A world where the bad, could atone to a God. Be forgiven of his sin. The fools words would be so strong because of that. So strong in fact, as to thrust the world unto a trance. Which it has not woke from, yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou see, the two men-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that was it. I was woken up by the sound of my alarm. And the rest of that odd story had been lost to me. It plagued my mind, weighed it down and distracted me from my work. Why was i reading that story to a baby? I don't even have a girlfriend. Why was that story a bedtime story. And what was the men's plans?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know, I know it's just a dream but something about that story captivated me, spoke to me on such a deep level, like it was part of my soul. When I got home from work I immediately went to write it all down, as close to perfect as I could recall. And when I finished, I still couldn't stop, I had to write the ending.\n\n*To figure it out.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat was their plan? Why thrust the world into a trance? What for? So many questions raced in my mind over and over again, looping through them never seeming solvable. But oh so close to revelation. The entire scenario from start to finish hit me like a semi-truck, steam rolled over everything I had assumed and felt. My entire life was holding its breath for a stupid dream with no ending. But I had to know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wrote and wrote and wrote, brainstorming idea, after idea. Nothing seemed to fit. The two men what? It was nearly Two A.M. And my tiredness had finally gotten the better of me. I went to my bed, and tried, desperately to get to sleep. Four A.M, still awake. But I think I'm onto something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sun, hadn't been mentioned once in that entire book. So it had to be part of the men's plans, somehow. The lynchpin talked of heavens and hells maybe the sun was a god of whatever religion they were talking about. Six A.M, no luck, the sun came up, and it felt like it was burning my skin. I couldn't sleep. I tried to take my mind off it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to calm myself down. I wasn't going to work today, I couldn't, not like this. I went to watch some videos on YouTube. Hoping that somehow, it would break me from this spell. What I saw instead only worsened it. A reply to a comment I had made months ago:\n\n\"You see, the two men, had instructed their lynchpin to exclaim he was the son of the sun.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, that was it, the next part. It made perfect sense, aligned perfectly, but, how, why? Who was the commentor? How could I even be so sure? Everything felt wrong and backwards. My mind raced with thought that I could not hold for more than a few moments before it left me, and replaced itself with another. Somehow, someone had added the next part to a story I had in my dreams. I questioned them as a reply and they never responded, of course. It went on like that, a random person I had never met would say a random sentence that added to the story from my dream.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"And the son of the sun would rise again. The sun would sleep. And the son would beam his glory into a new day. Where all good and bad would be judged, and those that followed will be marked.\"\n\n\\-Said a cashier as I was checking out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"The plan however, could not be enacted. Without a second lynchpin. A child who never spoke and only listened. A person like that would learn this story even as time and people changed it.\"\n\n\\-While on a call with my mother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"On the day this child would be born, the followers would stare and know that they are the one. And that, they must not look away.\"\n\n\\-A Stranger who spoke to me while on a walk in the park.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery moment in-between these pieces that I had gathered through unknown means was blurry. I think it had been two days since I had the dream? I can't tell. I kept filling in the parts told to me, a story being completed by people who didn't know each other. It made me sick just thinking about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"But you see, the two men were clever, they knew that bad men would follow readily. The thought that their sin could be undone and forgiven, was alluring, hypnotic.\"\n\n\\-I don't remember where I heard that one...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sun had begun burning, being in its presence made me wish for death. Like it was alive and staring at me, with hate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"But it was a trick, by the two wise men. And, just like when those two men had first met. Everything would be flipped upside down. The *sun* would rise, and the followers will know, they must not look away. And the son would sleep. Because to him it's just a bedtime story.\"\n\nThose words were my own, but, they weren't. It just spilled out of me, like someone was controlling my entire body. Like something had forced it's way inside of me. And made me speak it. In a half asleep daze I wrote those final words into these notes, as I did so, something shifted. Not a physical object, nor my perspective. Like the universe itself spun on an unseen axis, and the world of my room began fading out.\n\nShrinking to nothing but a line and then it disappeared entirely. And then I was floating, weightless in a deep and empty nothing. But in this state I knew that everyone and no one, had been here, and there was something in there with me. A presence, like when you feel someone walk into the room without any actual indication of them doing so. Like the unthinking intuition of my instincts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't think it was a god, or a demon, or anything like that. There was no benevolence, or malice. It just... *was*. This all encompassing presence but with no discernable emotion or motive. And then, it spoke. In a whisper a child-like voice rang out through the nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"And to those who saw the truth, beyond the twisting deceit. Keep your head down, your mouth shut and LOOK AWAY.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"The End.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose two words were an utter relief to hear. I thought it would be over. I thought that was all I needed to sleep. To finally finish that wretched story. But like all the others times that I had assumed that, I was wrong. The voice spoke again, no longer whispering.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"We apologize for the stress we've caused you. The story you've encountered has not yet found its time to ripen. You are early, and we are sorry. That dream was an accident. We suppose, we had just gotten...\" They paused and let out a long sigh before continuing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Too carried away, thinking about *the plan.*\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What are you? Who are you?\" My voice trembling. I darted around, shifting my body in the weightless nothing to no avail. And, they laughed.  With a warmth and comfort so familiar, as it echoed in nothingness around me. And in that moment all the stress and disorder I had been facing, just faded away. And everything was ok.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wasn't even tired. It felt so wonderful, like I was in the comfort of a lifelong friend. Something, I had no access too, outside of this place. It was the first time I was thinking straight since before that fateful night. But even then an overwhelming amount of questions still plagued my mind. But the most important I had already asked, and they laughed. As their laugh subsided, they spoke again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Don't be silly, we are everyone.\" They said almost cheerfully. Tears began streaming down my face as I felt the gnaw of delusion, paranoia and insomnia grasp me again. The refuge I had felt began caving around me, just as quickly as it had arrived.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Can you help me?\" I plead with tears streaming down my face. But the voice was silent. For such a long time.\n\n\"We are sorry, but we cannot. Your mind has been tainted with a knowledge man is not yet ready to know. Remember this, it does not go in vain. Your actions, previous and future, will be, wonderful.\" There was a hint of proudness in their voice. Not for themselves, but for me. I began to feel myself leaving this strange place and I begged the voice not to go. To help me and keep me safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery fiber of my being screamed out at me to trust them. I felt the soft embrace of a hug. And just like that I was staring in front of the completed story. Alone, and tired, sobbing. But now, I understand the dream and it's meaning. The sun is out and I can feel it calling. I can't sleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI keep hearing screaming. Although I'm pretty sure, they aren't actually real. But I can't help but imagine someone else walking out of their house and staring directly at the sun. Twenty-Four hours is all it would take. Twenty-Four hours to burn the retinas of all bad people, and I was one of them. As the sun circled around in our sky a chorus of anguished screams would chase it as that damn baby slept soundly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I want to sleep. I have to stare into the sun. My head keeps turning itself towards my window during the day. I have to fight to look away. I don't want to, but I know I don't get a choice. It's noon as I write this. I don't think I can fight for much longer. All the questions I had, don't matter and will remain unanswered. The story must've been real, but that was it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat bedtime story existing in a vacuum. With no answers to who or what or where or why or how or when. What I do know is that I'm early. I bite into a fruit not yet ripe. And the odd hospital case of a man staring into the sun until they went blind. Would be buried and forgotten. But this fate, my fate. Might one day be your own. Whenever that child is born. The streams of sunlight peaking through my closed blinds still burn, but I can hardly bring myself to tear my gaze from it. I'm barely able to focus on writing this. I have to look. I have to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sun is out. It's a beautiful day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConclusion:\n\nMr. Barnett's account is consistent with symptoms of sleep deprived psychosis. All experiences written down can be explained under this theory. However, what cannot be explained is the state the journal was found in. Wrapped in a bow, with a note reading, \"For Investigators.\" Additionally the pages in question were reordered. Sentences and whole paragraphs rearranged, only distinguishable from a slight change in hue and a barely visible line separating With an unknown handwriting filling in gaps that is not consistent with Mr. Barnett's.  \n\n\nAttempting to analyze how the cuts were made found no known method to result in the look found in the journal. Lastly on the final page written in the unknown handwriting, a note, it read the following:\n\nFor your reading pleasure.\n\n\\- With Love, C.W.O.H",

        "text": "It started out simple enough.\n\nI was bored. That was it really. Bored and just browsing social media when I saw it.\n\nIt was an incredible piece of art- stunning really, posted by one of my friends. Someone who I knew had never picked up a paintbrush in their lives, so I wanted to know the artist. Except, in their description they mentioned that it was generated by an AI.\n\nI don't want any of you stumbling onto the site in case something happens to you like it did with me, but let's just say that I fell for it and decided to visit the site myself.\n\nI wanted a profile pic- it was supposed to be a drawing of a dog near a bunch of sunflowers. That's how I thought of it- but it was kind of hard to get an actual artist to draw it. Especially when you didn't have any money.\n\nI tried the AI generator, and though it took a few attempts, I got an image I thought was good enough to use.\n\nFascinated, I tried other things that I wanted drawn. Most of them were too bad to be used, but I would occasionally find one that looked pretty good.\n\nThen, as I got bored and had trouble thinking of ideas, I decided to input a prompt that in hindsight, I should never have.\n\nDraw A Picture Of Me\n\nIf you're never used an AI generating software before, essentially you input a string of text describing what you want to see. Of course, I was just curious what to know the software would spit out when I put that kind of prompt in. There was no way that it knew what I looked like. For an extra kick, I added in:\n\nDraw A Picture Of Me, Manga Style\n\nI then hit 'Generate' and waited for a mess of pixels to pop up.\n\nInstead, I had a bit of trouble initially figuring out what it was that I was looking at.\n\nThere was a man with his face turned down. He had black hair, and he was sitting at a restaraunt. It couldn't been any place- or so I'd think, when I saw the sign in the background.\n\nA chill went down my spine. I opened up my phone.\n\nYeah, that's right- I had been to that place a week ago. I think I even took a selfie- yeah, the AI had even got my outfit right.\n\nNow, if you've never used an AI to generate images before, you should probably know that in general, it isn't very good at it. At least, not most modern AI. It's usually very easy to tell when something is AI generated. The computer often gets things wrong that no human would- like drawing someone's lips wrong, or giving someone an extra hand. Actually, a large majority of the errors I'd noticed whenever I put in a command were related to things like that.\n\nActually, it can be quite uncanny if you try to get an AI to make a human face. Some of them were nightmare inducing, to say the least.\n\nIt also has problems with letters or making signs, so the odds that it would spell out the restaraunt's name like that perfectly were close to zero.\n\nBut there was no way that it could've known where I was that day.\n\nBut I had to be sure...\n\nThere was an option to 'edit' an image you had made. I clicked on it, and then changed to prompt.\n\nDraw A Picture of Me, As A Black And White Photograph\n\nI clicked on the 'generate' button once again, and I nearly physically recoiled from the screen.\n\nIt was... perfect. A perfect render of what I looked like. \n\nI panicked- my laptop had no camera built in and I never used one, so how did it know what I looked like? Did it look through social media- but now, the Terms of Service said that it wouldn't work with photographs of real people. \n\nI should've probably left it at that. Turned the computer off, and went to sleep, trying to ignore what had happened like it was a bad dream.\n\nBut I didn't.\n\nI had to go further.\n\nA Photograph of My Car\n\nThe AI even got the dent in the rear down to a T.\n\nA Charcoal Drawing of My Bedroom\n\nYup. There was no mistaking it.\n\nBut how?\n\nHow was it spying on me? My phone- that was a possibility, but unless I'd been hacked there should've been no way too...\n\nAgain, I should've stopped there. Turned the computer off and gone to sleep.\n\nBut I didn't.\n\nA Crime Scene Photograph Of The Day I'll Die\n\nMy heart froze.\n\nIt was me, lying down, with a bullet wound in my chest. My lifeless eyes gazed up at the ceiling. A pool of blood trickled around my corpse.\n\nThere was a time stamp in the corner.\n\nA time that was thirty minutes from now.\n\nI wanted to shut it off right there and then, but I couldn't bring myself to. I had to know more- but... this couldn't be real, could it?\n\nA Picture Of Who Is Going To Kill Me\n\nAn image of a green car popped up. The driver was hidden in shadow, but there was a clear license plate on it.\n\nI had had enough at that point, and turned the computer off.\n\nThis was a bad dream.\n\nYeah, that's right. This was all that this was.\n\nI got up to go to bed when I saw it.\n\nOutside my window- a car had just come to a stop across the street. Green.\n\nI honestly don't know what to do now guys. I can't see the license plate, but something tells me that it'll be the same as in the picture. And I'm not dumb enough to go out to check\n\nBut the clock's still ticking. Just ten minutes until the time on the photograph. \n\nI've already called the cops, but I have a feeling that they won't be here in time. As it is, I don't think they would've taken my complaint seriously if I gave them the full picture. I just told them that there was an armed intruder approaching my house.\n\nAnd now, come to think of it, I can hear footsteps outside. \n\nI'm not sure if I should run at this point, and if so, to where. Would it make a difference? Was the photograph some kind of prophecy from the AI? Or now that i knew what was going to happen, could I change things?\n\nSorry, I have to run. Someone's turning my doorknob. Nowhere to run now, I'll just have to try and hide. Wish me luck guys.",

        "text": " \n\nIt all happened last Thursday. I was in my attic rummaging through old boxes of crap, looking for anything useful I could take with me to college. As I was busy looking in a particular box full of old office supplies my dad used to keep, I accidentally kicked over another box and spilled all of its contents on the floor. “Oh goddamnit” I muttered. I turned around to see what all had spilled over and saw it was a box full of binders and family photos. As I was putting the photos back inside of the box, one particular photo caught my eye. It was me as a kid at the Grand Canyon. I smiled a little bit, “I never knew mom and dad brought me to the Grand Canyon.” I thought to myself. I had always wanted to go, “why did they never tell me that they’ve taken me before?” I wondered to myself. I then flipped the photo over, on the back written in black marker, was the phrase “Max visits Arizona”. I was extremely confused, “My name isn’t Max?” I thought to myself. I had to turn the photo back over to make sure, but it had to be me. You could clearly see the paw shaped birthmark on my arm in the photo, which I still had. I also recognized the shirt I was wearing in the photo as a shirt that I had found in a box of my old baby clothes. “That’s definitely me in the photo, why does it say Max on the back?” I thought. It didn’t matter, I put the photo in my pocket and finished putting the rest of the photos back into the box, closed it up, then went downstairs.\n\nThe next morning I went downstairs to eat breakfast with my parents. While we were eating I asked my dad about our trip to the Grand Canyon. “Hey dad, why didn’t you ever tell me we went to the Grand Canyon?” He froze for a moment then looked at me confused. “What do you mean?” he replied. “Our trip to the Grand Canyon dad, we went when I was younger. Why didn’t you ever tell me we went?” By this point mom and dad were giving me a cold stare. “Son, that’s impossible, we never went to the Grand Canyon.” My mom said slightly concerned. Before I could respond, my dad quickly stood up and asked to speak with my mother in the living room. Before my mom left the kitchen she told me to quickly hurry up and finish breakfast and then to grab my car keys, because there were some errands she needed me to run for her. “But mom, I just woke up, can I atleast go take a shower first?” I asked. She turned and practically shouted at me “NOW!” before walking into the living room with my dad. I quickly finished  my breakfast, then grabbed my keys and left for the grocery store.\n\nI didn’t think much about it while I was out, to be honest I had basically forgotten about all of it until I got home. When I arrived at my house, my parents were not home. I unloaded all the groceries and then went up to my room to take a nap before dinner. Once dinner was ready, I came downstairs and sat down with my mom and dad. They were extremely quiet while we were eating. I asked them what was wrong and they both looked at me. “Son, why did you think we visited the Grand Canyon?” my dad said while almost giving me a death stare. “B-B-Because I went into the uh attic and I saw-” My mom and dad began yelling at me before I could finish talking. “Who let you go in the attic?! Why were you up there?! Are you fucking crazy?!”  I was at a loss. I excused myself from the table and went up to my room. “What was wrong with them? Why were they getting so angry about this? Why did they want to hide this from me so bad?” All these thoughts raced through my mind. I decided to do some more research. I looked at the photo I had taken from the attic and examined it closer. On the bottom right of the photo, there was a date. “06/28/2003”. The dates seemed to match up. I would’ve been 2 years old when this photo was taken. I decided to look further into this, I googled the date and what popped up terrified me.\n\nThe first article read. “2 people murdered at the Grand Canyon, AZ” My heart began to sink as I clicked onto the article. “2 people have been murdered at the Grand Canyon today at 8:40am. Police say the victims were Identified as 35 year old Richard Townley and 33 year old Ashley Townley. The whereabouts of the son Max Townley aged 2 are currently unknown but it is presumed he has fallen victim to the killers as well, police are currently investigating further.” My blood ran cold, My ears began to ring, and my vision began to go black. I then looked at the back of the photo once more. “Max visits Arizona” It all began to make sense. Why my parents would get so freaked out when I mentioned the Grand Canyon, why my dad often had nightmares about “Leaving fingerprints” It made sense why I was completely different from my “parents” in every way. As these thoughts crossed my mind, I heard my “parents” begin to walk up stairs.\n\nI immediately sprung up and locked my door. They began to knock. “Son open the door” my heart began to beat faster. “Please open the door, we want to talk to you.” I began to panic. “Who the fuck are you people?” I yelled through the door. “Son please open the door, let’s talk this out.”. I quickly looked around my room, trying to figure out what to do next. “I know what you did to my real parents!” I shouted through the door, with clear fear in my voice. “Please, you have to understand why, we had no choice.” I spotted what I was going to do next, I began opening my window when I heard my “mom” explain her side of the story. “Our son, Noah. He was a great kid, he passed away a few months before we found you, when we saw you at the Grand Canyon, we couldn’t help ourselves. We missed him so much, and you reminded us so much of him, we had to have you.” I wasn’t going to hear anymore of it. I climbed at my window and jumped down into the garden and ran away from the house. \n\nI couldn’t believe it. My entire life was a lie. They had killed MY parents and kidnapped me, and used their dead son’s identity on me. I had lived most of my life as Noah, just to find out it wasn’t me. It was all too much for me. I ran to the police station and told them the entire story. When the police arrived at my old home, they found it empty. My fake parents had quickly packed their bags and skipped town. It didn’t matter though. I knew everything about them, their names, phone numbers, and much more. It was only going to be a matter of time before these sick freaks were caught, and my real parents would finally receive justice. \n\nFast forward to today, I have tried to live my new life as Max. I have been finding out as much as I can about my original family and am in the process of reaching out to relatives. However something strange happened during my process. I went to a local park to meet an aunt of mine when I noticed two figures in hoods walking a small crying boy into the woods who was crying for his mom. Now, normally I’m not the one to make assumptions but when I got home and saw on the news that there were two people murdered at the park today and their son has gone missing. I think it is safe to assume someone replaced me as their son today.",

        "text": "Greetings to you all. My name is Sven. I just really need to speak to someone, to let it out and perhaps ease my conscience before it is too late. I have made the biggest mistake of my life. \n\nI work as a security guard officer in a small port in Europe, and I have been in the job for almost a decade now without any major incident. I did not know that it would change nine days ago in one of the worst manners. \n\nThat night, at around 7 am during my last patrol, I heard faint tapping sounds coming from the container yard. I paid attention, while walking in the yard, shining my flashlight on containers as a reaction to the tapping that grew louder as I approached the impending doom. \n\nUnder six minutes, I finally located the container and could clearly hear someone tapping from inside it. Those containers were emptied earlier in the day, I remembered, baffled by the fact that someone instead of at least something, had been mistakenly forgotten inside. \n\nThe moment I tapped on the container to make my presence known, the person trapped in the storage box also tapped from inside it, on the same spot and at the same time, almost as if that person knew what I would do. \n\n\"Who's there? Who's inside?\" I asked, certain that it could just be a stevedore trapped inside following a mistake or even a prank, and I wanted to play a little bit with the person. I was answered with silence.\n \nWith my radio, I contacted my colleague Lana to explain the situation to her and we even laughed a little bit about that, persuaded that it was either a mistake or a prank. However, the seriousness of the situation resurfaced when I gave the container number to Lana and, she could not find it in any record whatsoever.\n\n\"Please, please, help me. Open the door.\" I heard a faint male voice coming from inside. For a few seconds, I was frozen in place, shocked and unable to answer because, he really sounded like me.\n\n\"Sir? You alright?\" I asked, after regaining my composure. \n\n\"I am not alright. Please help me. Open the door.\" The man answered. \n\n\"How did you end up in there?\" I asked with a smile, still willing to joke with him about it before I help him.\n\n\"Please help me. Open the door.\" He pleaded again, with the same tone, like some kind of recording prepared for the situation. \n\n\"Really? It was true? I thought you were pulling a prank.\" Goran, another security officer, said while arriving on the scene. \n\n\"Please, help me. Open the door.\" The man said. \n\n\"What? Kinda sounds like you bro.\" Goran noticed. \"Who's that?\" He added. \n\n\"That is me.\" The man spoke. \n\n\"You hurt?\" I asked, thinking that it was enough and we had to let him out. \n\n\"I am hurt, I am bleeding, I am feeling cold, please help me. Open the door.\" The man said. \n\nI approached, ready to help, but Goran stopped me on my track, squinting his eyes as if he just noticed something wrong. I could agree that someone speaking like that, and using full words instead of contractions seemed strange. However, that man could just be disoriented and especially needed help. \n\n\"How did you end up in there?\" Goran questioned. Once again, no answer. \"Who are you?\" He added. \n\n\"I am me.\" The man spoke. \n\n\"You who? What's your name?\" Goran asked. No answer. \n\n\"You work here?\" I asked. \n\n\"No. The sun will soon rise. Please help me. Open the door.\" \n\n\"The sun? How do you know that?\" Goran asked, but the man stayed silent. \n\n\"Maybe he got a watch.\" I suggested. \n\n\"It's all dark in there.\" Goran pointed out. \n\n\"An electronic one?\" I again suggested, trying to help the man's case. \"How many are you in there?\" I added. \n\n\"Me.\" The man spoke. \n\n\"Where you coming from?\" Goran randomly asked. \n\n\"From far away. The sun will soon rise. Please let me out, please help me. Open the door.\" The man said.\n\n\"Where exactly?\" I questioned. \n\n\"Where there is no sun. Please, the sun will soon rise. Please help me. Open the door.\" The man answered.\n\nAfter a lot of arguing with Goran, and pleading from the man, other security guards and other colleagues from different departments also arrived on the scene, prompting the reluctant Goran to finally succumb to pressure and let me open the door to rescue the man.\n\nI began the process to open the storage steel box, while Goran and the others stood behind me, guns and flashlights ready, to prevent any kind of foul play. I pulled the right side open and expected the man to appear but he did not move. I pulled the left side open, and unveiled the horror that awaited for us.\n\nThere was nobody and nothing in the container, except for a wooden mannequin covered with strange symbols carved on it. That thing had clearly its place in a mystic temple or a shrine instead of a steel box. The walls of the container were also covered with bizarre drawings and symbols. \n\n\"I told you not to open that door.\" A now trembling Goran spoke.\n\nAt that instant, the mannequin tilted its head to the left, making cracking sounds and a smile mysteriously carved itself on its face, before the mannequin turned into dust, from its head to its feet, and the dust escaped from the container. \n\nWe looked at the whole phenomenon, frightened, paralyzed, powerless and also mentally broken at the realization that we might have released a calamity into the city and the world, something we do not even know the nature or the capacity of.\n\nThe day after, Goran was found mysteriously dead in his living room. No wound, no fight, no sickness, no nothing. He was just dead, an expression of pure fright stuck on his face. That entity, in addition to being terrifying, was also vengeful. \n\nSince, I have been checking the news relentlessly, for I am sure to bear a part of responsibility for any tragedy that thing may cause, be it accident, disease or even death. That thing will come for us, but if that container was meant to imprison it, then it was certainly dangerous for the whole world too.\n\nTherefore, whatever happens to you, please, accept these sincere apologies for our mistake. I am really sorry.",

        "title": "I'm a taxi driver in a Big city, I pick up some strange people sometimes",
        "author": "ImProbablyOkay-",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10nufgs/im_a_taxi_driver_in_a_big_city_i_pick_up_some/",
        "text": " \n\nI should start by saying that most people I pick up are overwhelmingly normal. A few drunk guys, some college students too tired to walk, young adults off to another bar or club, but every now and again I find myself driving around with some real oddities. I guess you can say that’s the product of Big City, but I shudder to imagine this could be normal anywhere else. I’m also not going to tell you where Big City is, just know it’s a big city with lots of people.  \n\n\nHere, this first guy will be a good example. It was a normal night, around 11pm or so when I spot a guy on the sidewalk waving me down. He’s dressed in a formal looking suit with slicked back hair and an expensive looking watch on his wrist. Definitely not the usual attire of somebody who needs a taxi, but I’m not in the business of making judgments.  \n\n\n“Hey, how are ya?” I said.  \n\n\n“It’s been a pleasant evening so far, and you?” He said while ducking into the back seat.  \n\n\n“I can't complain. Where ya headed?” I said.  \n\n\n“I’ll be staying at the Grand Yhatt Inn this evening sir! I’d be delighted if you would take me there.” He said with a smile full of grandeur.  \n\n\n“You got it” I said.  \n\n\nI flipped off my taxi light and started my tally, I didn’t need the directions as this was a very popular destination around here.  \n\n\n“That’s a nice looking suit” I said.  \n\n\n“You have a sharp eye there Mr…?” He said.  \n\n\n“Call me driver” I said.  \n\n\n“Ha, alright Mr. Driver, you’d be correct this is a nice suit, and someone with keen eyes like yours might also have asked yourself why a man such as myself would be taking a taxi when he clearly has stature for someone who owns a personal car and driver?” He exclaimed.  \n\n\nHis arrogance kinda pissed me off but after 13 years of driving this taxi one thing I’ve learned is how to stomach anger.  \n\n\n“It’s because I’m an inventor dear driver, and though my driving personnel are reliable wheelmen, they’re shitty confidants. I must keep my invention away from those in positions to steal it.” He continued.  \n\n\n“Ahh, gotcha, so you must have invented something pretty great then huh?” I asked.  \n\n\nA smirk grows on his face. He ducks down behind my seat and pulls out a small black box, then puts on a black glove. He flips open the lid and turns it around, revealing what looked like a small metal ball bearing.  \n\n\n“You invented a ball bearing? Hate to break it to you but that’s already been invented” I said.  \n\n\nHe scoffed dramatically before picking it up and holding it close to my head.  \n\n\n“This here is… well to put it extremely primitively, this is an amalgamation of rare earth elements with very unique reactionary tendencies to almost all physical objects!” He said.  \n\n\nHe flips the ball into the air and catches it in his palm.  \n\n\n“If I were to drop this ball right here in your car it would eat straight through the floor in seconds, then pass right through the pavement and into the crust of the earth. Not even the earths core would be able to stop it, not until it hit the center of gravity where it would remain forever. The only reason I can handle it now is because I’ve put on my control glove, along with the my container. They’re made of another rare earth element resistant to this ball’s properties, so rare in fact that there isn’t enough of it left on earth to make a second glove!” He said.  \n\n\n“Hey man, I’m not sure I understand but please don’t toss that thing around in my car while I’m driving” I said.  \n\n\nHe frowned at me, like he was dissatisfied with my response. He puts the small metal ball back into its box.  \n\n\n“I don’t think you appreciate the greatness of this invention Mr. Driver. Something like this could revolutionize industries all over the world! This one object alone breaks multiple laws of thermodynamics as we know it. The creation of this object could mean that the laws of nature so sternly placed by god himself could be bent to my will!” He said.  \n\n\n“Alright alright, I get it, just calm down there friend I didn’t mean to insult your invention” I said.  \n\n\nHe takes a deep breath and seems to relax a bit.  \n\n\n“Apologies Mr. Driver, I didn’t mean to become excitable, but to satiate your concerns you should be aware that I will not drop this invention, I could not be so crass.” He said.  \n\n\n“It’s fine, we’ll be arriving at your destination here shortly.” I said.  \n\n\n“Excellent, but I must insist of you Mr. Driver, do not tell anyone about this, I trust that this will suffice for keeping your silence” he said.  \n\n\nHe hands me a fancy clip of cash, all hundreds.  \n\n\n“Yes sir, that will do nicely, and if any of your other rich friends need a ride let me know. I’d be glad to take them” I said.  \n\n\nHe laughed as he stepped out of my cab, I promised one last time I wouldn’t say a thing and he walks into the hotel lobby. Now I know what you must be thinking, clearly I did not keep his promise based on the fact you’re reading this right now, but as you’re about to read it doesn’t really matter.  \n\n\nAbout 2 days after I dropped him off there was a headline in the local newspaper about a mysterious murder in the Grand Yhatt hotel. A man with no ID and a fancy suit was found shot in his hotel room bed. The door was locked from the inside and no casings could be found. The bullet managed to pass through the floor of his room and the police can’t find it. My guess is he was ogling his invention and accidentally dropped it on himself. I felt bad for him honestly, his invention absolutely worked. One little mistake was all it took to destroy both the invention and the inventor in one foul swoop. That ball is probably on its way to the core of the earth by now, I just hope it doesn’t do anything disastrous when it gets there.  \n\n\nNot every encounter ends up being so whimsical though. Not that his death was anything funny but you can’t say he didn’t have it coming throwing that thing around like that. The next story I want to share was far darker. I still think about it late at night.  \n\n\nSometimes I like to take unusual roads around town when it’s been a slow night. It’s risky for sure since it’s not the nicest side of town, but I’ve built up sort of a small reputation around here as the cabby who doesn’t ask questions and drug dealers tip big for silence. Doesn’t make me feel great but it puts food on the table and I have a daughter to put through college some day, so there I was. This girl stepped out in front of my car out of nowhere, she was about late twenties, had straight brown hair and fair skin, definitely not the kind of girl that should be slumming it up with the prostitutes and crackheads, which is why my heart sank when I saw how torn up and bloody her clothes were.  \n\n\nThis was the scenario I dreaded the most when coming down this way, honestly I’d rather be shot and robbed then have to look into the eyes of some young girl who’s life is now ruined. It breaks my dad heart. She just stood there crying in front of my car so I ushered her into the back of my cab and just started driving on instinct to the hospital.  \n\n\n“Thank you! *\\*sniff\\** Thank you so much for stopping” she said, barely keeping it together.  \n\n\n“What happened? Are you ok?” I said.  \n\n\nShe lifted her knees to her chest and hugged them.  \n\n\n“I was at a bar and then… I… I don’t know! I don’t remember anything but my head hurts and I woke up in the alley and… and…” she said.  \n\n\nShe just breaks down. Dribbling and crying into her knees.  \n\n\n“It’s ok, it’s ok, you’re safe now alright? I’m gunna take you to the hospital to get you checked out ok?” I said.  \n\n\nShe looks up from her lap and nods slightly.  \n\n\nWhat’s your name?” I said.  \n\n\n“Emily” she said.  \n\n\n“Ok Emily, do you know who did this to you?” I asked.  \n\n\n“No, no… I just… I don’t know anything! I can’t remember anything!” She screamed.  \n\n\n“Hey it’s ok, don’t focus on that now alright? Was anyone around when you woke up or were you alone?” I asked.  \n\n\n“No one was there, I was just laying there in the alleyway and… and…” she said.  \n\n\nI felt my heart beat in my temples, I was just so mad I swear whoever did this to her probably felt a shiver.  \n\n\n“It’s alright, you’re safe now I won’t let anyone hurt you, just hang in there we’re about 10 minutes from the hospital” I said.  \n\n\n“Thank you… *\\*sniff\\** I don’t know what I would have done if you hadn’t-” she suddenly stopped.  \n\n\nShe just stopped crying instantly, put both her legs back down onto the floor of the car and carefully placed her hands in her lap.  \n\n\n“I’m ok now, there’s no need to take me to the hospital” she said in a perfectly calm voice.  \n\n\n“Wha- What?” I said.  \n\n\n“I’m perfectly ok, I was just overreacting to a minor situation. Instead I would like you to deliver me to this address.” She said, handing me a small piece of paper.  \n\n\nI could hardly believe what I was hearing. This girl had completely changed her entire demeanor in an instant. I really didn’t know what to say, but I definitely was not taking her to that address.  \n\n\n“I must return to my home, please take me there at once. You will be paid handsomely for this service.” she said.  \n\n\n“Look, this trip is going to be free of charge ok? Just let me take you to the hospital to at least have them check you out, I wanna make sure you’re not hurt alright?” I said.  \n\n\n“I demand to be dropped off at that address, you’re a cab driver are you not? You take people to where they want to go.” She said.  \n\n\n“What the hell is the matter with you? Snap out of it!” I said.  \n\n\n“You will drop me off at this address or I will contact the police and report you for theft.” She said.  \n\n\n“I am *not* taking you anywhere but the hospital lady, and if that means you’re going to call the cops on me then so be it!” I said.  \n\n\n“Fine, if you will not take me home then I will walk there myself.” She said.  \n\n\nThen she opened the car door while I was diving on the freeway and just stepped out. I was going fast too, over the speed limit. The sound it made as she was sucked out of the back of my cab still wakes me up at night sometimes.  \n\n\nShe was killed instantly, which for all I know could have been a mercy. The ambulance had to practically scrape what was left of her off the road. I got brought in for questioning by the police but the interior camera I installed cleared me of any wrongdoing. For the most part it seemed like the they felt bad for me so I didn’t spend that much time there. The cops ended up going to the address she gave me and found nothing but an empty lot, other than that I haven’t heard anything about the situation since.  \n\n\nI was pretty destroyed by the whole thing. One thing she said stuck out to me as particularly odd though. When she mentioned calling the cops she said she was going to report me for theft, not kidnapping. I don’t know what could have happened to her before I found her, but I’m glad I never took her to that address. I went home from the police station that night, hugged my daughter and cried a bit. I try not to bring home the crazy shit I see at work but that one hit too close to heart.  \n\n\nThat interior camera is a life saver by the way. It’s actually how I’ve been able to recreate the conversations so well thus far. I know what you’re gunna say, don’t ask because I’m not going to show you any of the footage, it has my face and car interior on it and I don’t want you to see that. I’ve already said some shit that might get me fired and I won’t take that risk.  \n\n\nIn this last story I’m gunna tell, that interior camera probably saved my life. I’ll let the story speak for itself but perhaps this can serve as an example to all you cabbies out there. Get yourself some video evidence.  \n\n\nIt was a pretty slow day for the most part, when it gets rainy a lot of people just stay where they’re at and don’t need a cab. This one old fellow waved me down from the underside of an apartment awning so I stopped to pick him up. He looked to be in his 70’s to 80’s, he walked slow so I helped him into the back seat. He thanked me with a really sweet smile and told me he wanted to go to the Big City bridge, so off we went.  \n\n\n“It’s beautiful weather for a walk don’t you think?” He said.  \n\n\n“I can’t say I agree old timer, I’m more of a summer guy myself, the cold fall weather chills me to the bone” I said.  \n\n\n“Bah! It’s the cold that really makes you feel alive!” He said.  \n\n\nWe talked about the weather and other trivial things until we made it to the bridge. Not a thing was odd about him, just a friendly old man. He paid his fee, tipped his hat, and slowly walked off towards the bridge. That was that last time I ever saw him.  \n\n\nWhen I stopped at the bridge, another person ran up to the side of my cab and asked for a ride, so I let him in. He was a younger guy, maybe twenties, in good shape, and was meeting up with his girlfriend for lunch at a popular restaurant around here. I started a new tally and off we went.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 5 minutes after we left the bridge the kid in the back lifts something up into his hand.  \n\n\n“What’s this?” He said.  \n\n\n“Don’t know, looks like some kind of little statue, where’d you find that?” I said.  \n\n\n“I was here under the edge of your seat. Awe man! I think that old guy must have left this in your cab. We should turn back we might still catch him.” He said.  \n\n\nI let out a big sigh.  \n\n\n“You’re probably right, don’t worry kid I won’t add this to your tally, we’ll find him” I said.  \n\n\nWith that I turned the cab around and started heading back the way we came.  \n\n\n“This things weird, kinda old and creepy. Maybe it’s some family heirloom or something.” He said.  \n\n\n“Just don’t break it alright? Who knows what’s valuable these days.” I said.  \n\n\n“I won’t I won’t. There’s this weird inscription on the side of it. It says…”  \n\n\nNow I’d try and describe what he said next but I really don’t have any idea, it was pretty much gibberish. I ran it through a few language detection sites and all of them come up empty. He also stammered through the whole thing which I guess makes sense when you’re reading a nonsensical language. After reading the whole thing he gets this weird look on his face. Then he just started screaming.  \n\n\n“GET OUT OF MY HEAD AAAAUT OF MY HEEAAD GET IT OUT OF MY HE-“ he screamed, then went limp.  \n\n\nI slammed on the breaks and turned to face him.  \n\n\n“JESUS kid what the fuck? Hey! Hey, are you ok?” I said.  \n\n\nHe sits up, looks me dead in the eye and gives me a huge sinister grin.  \n\n\n“Oh I’m more than alright friend, but no more questions alright? You will now drive silently to a nice lot on Middleton street yes?” He said.  \n\n\nHe makes some kind of hand motion and I got completely silent. I faced the road with an empty look on my face and just drove.  \n\n\n“That’s better, don’t worry I don’t have plans to kill you right now, I mean I’m still in the car right? Haha!” He said.  \n\n\nHe motions his hand again and like a puppet on a string I laugh like a mindless henchman. It’s here I should mention that I have absolutely no memory of any of this. It would have been a totally normal day to the best of my memory if I hadn’t viewed the footage.  \n\n\n“My, this body is a real good one! Thank you taxi driver for finding me such a suitable replacement. That old one was starting to turn to dust I say, a truly horrid behavior of normal people I might add.” He said.  \n\n\n“Yes… master…” I said in a voice that sounded nothing like my own.  \n\n\n“Good boy! Now, drop me off right about here, this should do nicely.” He said.  \n\n\nI park the car on the side of the road and we both step out. From here I can’t see what’s going on but you can still hear him chatting away.  \n\n\n“Fantastic work! Now, I want you to forget everything about this little outing we had today, not one bit of it will remain in your memories. Furthermore, in three days while you’re driving your taxi, I want you to drive it directly into the Big City river and don’t come back out, understand?” He said.  \n\n\n“Yes… master…” I said.  \n\n\n“Delightful! I’ll be on my way now, au revoir!” He said.  \n\n\nAfter that I got back into my taxi I drove off, from there I can remember things that happened for the rest of that day while completely oblivious to anything being wrong.  \n\n\nAbout midway through the second day since this happened, the police contacted me about a missing person they were looking for. An old man named Mike Cole. He was last seen exiting his apartment and getting into my cab and the police wanted to know where he went from there. I let them view my interior camera footage and they were satisfied after seeing Mr. Cole exit my cab on the Big City bridge. I however was far more interested in the fact that I didn’t remember him at all, or the guy who got in my cab next, so I watch the rest of the footage and figured it all out.  \n\n\nI stayed home on the third day, never got behind the wheel once, and honestly if it weren’t for the fact that I needed this job to live I probably would have stayed out of cars forever. After driving my cab a few times on the days after my death date I’m satisfied in saying I’m probably not going to mindlessly drive into the Big City river, but I still avoid driving near it when I can, just in case.  \n\n\nMike Cole was found by the way. About 2 days after the police saw my footage they were dragging his body out of the river. I hope he didn’t remember any of it. Not the brainwashing or the life he missed out on. I don’t want to imagine him finally regaining control over his mind just to witness his own death. That would be too sad.  \n\n\nThat’s all the stories I have for you for now, not that I don’t have more it’s just writing all of this out really brought back a lot of the trauma I thought id packed away deep inside me. Regardless of that, I’ll continue driving my cab. I don’t think I can do anything else really, it’s what I’m good at. My daughter is turning 16 in a few months and I absolutely have to make enough cash to send her somewhere better than this. I’ve seen some pretty horrible things living in this city, and even worse things driving in it every day, so I know better than anyone how much of a hell hole it is.  \n\n\nI will give her a better life, even if it means I never sleep a peaceful night again.",

It was May and the fields that stretched endlessly along the side of the road were bursting into vibrant green. Illinois is soybean land, and on a clear day you can see for miles and miles. The sight is boring to some, God knows it used to bore the hell out of me, but now on entering my thirty-fifth year I find it invigorating. Freeing. Perhaps it’s the result of seventeen years of claustrophobic city-living, five in Chicago and the rest in New York. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI had almost forgotten what the horizon looked like, and now I could see nothing else. It assaulted me. The horizon was all that there was, now that the farmers had finally cleared away the last of those pesky trees. They had to make room for more farmland. But what about the deer? They were swarming the roads. I had already passed one exploded buck since I’d crossed the Mississippi. It had no antlers. Sawn off by some redneck for trophy, probably. Unsportsmanlike if you ask me. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut that sky. You couldn’t deny that sky. It was high blue and just everywhere. It took up four-fifths of the world out here and stood totally blank, except for the softest of white brushstrokes, and those could only be seen if you stopped the car and looked straight up. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI switched to the right lane and slowed down to forty-five. I was looking for the billboard I knew must be coming up soon. It was also blue, but a fading royal blue, with a picture of a ridiculously tall meringue pie hand-painted across the surface. On top of the billboard, I remembered, was a plywood extension built just for the ruby red cherry on top. Across the bottom was written: THELMA’S FAMOUS MILE-HIGH PIES, EXIT 52, 1 MILE. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOnce, and only once, my father had taken me to there to try Thelma’s famous Mile-High after many years of begging. I had the idea I might stop at the old sprawling restaurant, a relic even in ‘**`XX`**. It might still be there. Hell, I might even see Thelma herself. She wasn’t that old back then, forties maybe. She might still be alive. She might still be able to pull a pie out of the oven and toast the meringue. Hell, my great-grandmother baked into her nineties. She even put her pies on the windowsill to cool, even though we all told her it was ridiculous.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*You were twelve the last time you were here. Don’t be disappointed if it’s gone. Things change. People die.* \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut here it was, the big blue billboard was just starting to surface over the curve of the horizon. It was there, faded sure, more than faded, it was— \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n“Motherfucker!” I cried. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe billboard wasn’t faded. It was gone. All that was left of Thelma’s Mile High Pies was a square skeleton of pipe and framing. The blue I had seen was the just sky peeking out between the board’s rusted steel ribcage. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNo, that wasn’t all. In the middle of the frame, ridiculously small, hung a plain white banner. Slapped across it in red was a single word: \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##REPENT!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI shot past the sign shaking my head. My good spirits had been crushed like a boot stomping out the glowing embers of a fire. What was I doing, coming back to the town where I had lived as a boy, trying to catch something that was irrevocably lost? What could I possibly gain by walking the bricked (probably asphalted now) downtown streets, or going to the (probably long-closed) soda fountain, which seemed impossibly kitsch even then. What could be waiting for me at the end of this road besides a hundred different kinds of humdrum disappointment? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA flash of yellow caught my eye off to the left, and when I looked that way I felt a blast of pleasure and recognition. A large hill towered far across a plowed-flat field— the prehistoric consequence of a passing glacier, or maybe a yet-undiscovered Indian burial mound (there were lots in the area)— and right at its peak stood a familiar sunflower yellow barn. It was there then and it was here now, just as bright, probably re-painted by its owner every year. It looked exactly the same. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n“Shitcan eyesore!” I exclaimed with a grin, repeating my father’s long-ago slogan.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThen an overpass blotted it out. I looked for it in the rear view, knowing it wouldn’t reappear. Maybe it was going to be all right after all. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI dropped my eyes to the road, pushing the accelerator as I did. I watched for the sign. Presently it came up and out of the distance, shimmering in metallic green.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nVANDALIA\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n5 MILES\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe exit came up on the right, and for a moment I considered blowing right past it. I could stay on I-70 all the way to Effingham. A quick left would put me on 57. In two hours I would be hungry and I could stop for lunch in Champaign. I could drink in the college life, possibly flirt with a bored sorority girl or two. It wasn’t impossible. I’m still relatively trim and hell, dad bods are considered sexy now, right? After that I could head on to Chicago, with their overcrowded bars and irritatingly affordable apartments. It would be warm there. I could sunbathe at Montrose Beach, talk to some curiously friendly city folks, get invited to a house party, maybe hear about a place, a cute little one-bedroom in Lakeview, I could rent it, find a job that sends me a paycheck just before the money runs out…\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI signaled, slowed the Enterprise rental, and went up the ramp. Toward the top, where a stoplight paused the traffic trying to enter US-51, I glanced down at my watch. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt had stopped. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI skirted town, taking Amblin Way to Rural Route 3, heading to the site of the old Wal-Mart. It had stood next to the interstate for two decades, alone except for a dirty Burger King a half-mile away. It was finally torn down a few years ago. Damaged in a tornado, they say. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy mind wanted to speak up, but I would not let it. *Not yet. Please, not yet.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI was amazed by just how little things had changed out here. The road still curved down and around a hill and deposited my car on an insanely flat and straight road that, like an idiot child’s drawing, seemed to stretch on to infinity. On the right was still a vista of empty countryside. Its only feature besides brown dirt was a sign placed every mile or so that proclaimed, desperately, LAND FOR SALE. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI turned left at Jefferson Street and after a short drive I saw it. I pulled over and got out of the car. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe grass grew wild and tall around the lot, obscuring the concrete parking stops that lined its perimeter. Buzzing cicadas droned in it, and I could see little green grasshoppers jumping back and forth in great confused arcs. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe lot itself was tar-black. Faded parking lines wobbled crazily from the hot air rising off the asphalt. In the middle of the lot, about the size and shape of a New York City block, stood the empty grey foundation of what had once been the Vandalia Wal-Mart. Any sense of identity had been stripped away from it. The demolition team had taken the building, and years of rainstorms and heavy snow had washed off any marker that might have been left. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI felt a strong urge to walk over that hot blacktop, climb up the haphazard, cracking foundation, and retrace my old shopping route through the store. Here to the right were the rows and rows of empty shopping carts, and on past them was the grocery section. Then there was Seasonal Candy, and to the right of that were the clothes (no need to go that way) and ahead stood Homewares. If you hurried through there, then took a left at Greeting Cards, you would find yourself in Toys. That was the place to be. That was where you had sheltered during the tornado of ‘**`XX`**.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI swallowed and stared at the lot, almost hypnotized. It stared back indifferently.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDamaged by a tornado. Isn’t that funny. I had sheltered here once from a tornado. It was probably just dumb luck that the whole building hadn’t caved right in on my head. I had only been in one other tornado in my life, and that time I certainly wasn’t in a Wal-Mart. Like any respectable person, I had been at home.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe spent all night huddled in the bathroom. Mom and I were in the tub, her with one ear glued to the wind-up radio she bought from the Rural King that morning. Minnie, our elderly dachshund, had thrown her shiny black body over both of us. She shivered and moaned uncontrollably. Sometimes she would roll her eyes up at us and sigh. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI only left the bathroom once that night, to get more batteries for my Game Boy. Looking back, I realize the worst of the storm must have been over. Why else would my parent let me walk through the house alone? But at the time I genuinely felt like I was taking my life in my hands. I remember closing the door to the bathroom behind me. It was like letting the door of a shallow crypt swing shut. I tip-toed through the house. Glass was rattling in every window. The storm howled outside. It wasn’t a movie sound either, it sounded like a voice, and sometimes it was many voices, and they were moaning right on the other side of the walls. It sounded like something \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n(or some*things*)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nwas trying to speak, pretending to be human. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe batteries were in the dry pantry next to the refrigerator. I had made the trip a million times before, sometimes two or three times a day. But the sounds, rain and howling, were foreign to my young ears. Strange too was the alien light spilling through the kitchen window. It was almost green, pulsing in an irregular tattoo, and its rays were cut into swirling ribbons by the great black storm clouds that were racing by overhead. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI stood rigid on the kitchen threshold, one hand wrapped around the thin door casing in a death grip. I groped for the light switch. I hated feeling for a light switch in a dark room. I had the idea - a stupid idea, even for a kid - that while my fingers were running along the waxy wallpaper some horrible, clammy hand would settle lightly over mine...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Don’t be an idiot.* Nothing could live in the dark. Not in the dark my child mind imagined. To me the darkness somehow contained a whole different world, like an alternate dimension. It was a shadow world that lived just a breath away from our own, and if could reach it you would see terrible wonders. You could reach it if you sidestepped just a certain way. Or you could there by climbing into the right tree hole. You could accidentally fall into it, maybe, and then you would cross over and come face-to-face with all manner of crouched and lurking monsters; things that were all hairy and had rows and rows of overlapping razor teeth, and eyes that glowed with yellow bloodlust. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd these things that lived in the dark were hungriest for boymeat. Just the sight of my smooth and unbroken skin would drive them into a frenzy, and they would take me apart with their mouths and their hooked fingers and their teeth, slick and foamy, stringy with ravenous drool.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Dumbass!* What would my mom say, if she caught me like this? Here he is, your only son, straddling the doorway like a lover, his eyes squeezed shut, his teeth gritted, mouth stretched out so wide you can see that ragged hole left by the molar that fell out last week! Funny? Oh you better believe it! *Grab the Polaroid and snap a picture, Ma! Make sure to save that one for his wedding!*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\t\nThe wind was chucking hail against the house. It sounded like fingers tapping inside the walls. The moan came again and this time it sounded like a thick, otherworldly chuckle. The window above the sink was suddenly lit up with roiling green-yellow light. Lightning. Shadows sprang up across the wall and they did a spooky *danse macabre* before laying down again behind the furniture. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy fingers found the switch. Thank God!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThey snapped it-\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-and nothing. No light!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Shit! The power!*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLightning again. The kitchen was lit in a flashbulb burst. It left a bleary snapshot on my retinas, not really sight but an afterimage that my mind held for several seconds after the light died away.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSomebody was standing in the corner. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy mental switchboard fizzled out, too overloaded to handle what I had seen. I just stood in the doorway, feeling my hand go slack and fall away from the switch, completely unable to stop it. My chest hitched up. The screams were too big to come out. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\t\n\nHe was dressed in black. He wore a ski mask. It the kind you wore in winter, pulled over the head. His eye glowed through the oval holes. They were huge and glassy. Red embers flickered in the center of the pupils, which were huge and dilated in a way that later in life I would associate with a really good LSD trip.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*There’s a man here,* my mind whispered. *There’s a man standing in your kitchen.* But that’s impossible, isn’t it? He wasn’t there a minute ago. And besides, the monsters can only live in the shadows, not the light. They die in the light. They have to stay in the dark. Right?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI realized with sickening horror that I could still see the man’s eyes floating in the dark. They were twin pinpricks of glowing crimson punched into the shadows over the table. Those eyes dimmed, then brightened, like a embers smoldering in a breeze. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA hallucination. It had to be. A mirage caused by the lightning. Like those black spots, the ones that float around after you get your school picture taken. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut the eyes were there. They were fixed on me, curiously, like a tiger who’s suddenly noticed you at the zoo. And those eyes, so evil and so awful, were those eyes now floating towards me? No. Not possible. Sure, there could be a man standing in my house. It was very possible that his eyes were there, staring at me in the dark\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut those eyes couldn’t be floating towards me, not over the kitchen table that stood between us. *Over* it? Without moving it? Without his body touching the table in any way? Yet that’s just what they appeared to be doing. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy paralysis broke and I did the only thing I could think of: I flicked the light switch again. It was an automatic motion, a reflex, I might have even hit it accidentally. I really can’t remember. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\t\n\nWhat I do remember is the overhead light ignited. A blast of tungsten hit my eyes. Tears sprang and I had to shut them. My irises screamed. Then the fear hit me again and I wrenched my eyelids open.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\t\n\nBut when I looked into the corner, through eyes burning and streaming tears, heart pumping crazy, leaping beats into my ears, when I looked, the corner was empty. There was no shadowy figure there, no man in black. There was just a patch of flowery, powder blue wallpaper, and a round-framed black-and-white photo of my grandmother.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\t\n\nUnder. Hiding under the table. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI bent over so fast that both knees popped like twin shotgun blasts.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNothing. There was no figure hiding between the forest of table-and-chair legs. There were no black, dilated eyes staring at me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI hurried back to the bathroom without turning off the lights. I explained to my mother that actually, I was tired of my game and I didn’t like it anymore. Then I sat down in the tub and let her stroke my hair until she fell asleep.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI turned away from the parking lot, shivering despite the heat. I put my hand on the warm hood of the rental car and listened to the *tick-tick-tick* of the engine. My eyes drifted back to Jefferson Street. It led, I knew, straight downtown. To Vandalia. The town was still here after all these years. Changed, yes, but here. It had waited for me. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI got in the car, started it, and drove back up the hill.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNo, the man was not real. Monsters were not real. Things with glowing, hateful red eyes that grabbed you and pulled you into their world of fists and teeth and agony could not be real, not there, not in the same house where your mother stroked your hair and told you that she loved you. Those monsters only existed in the movies, and in books, and even then they were just flat men, two-dimensional, and if they did attack, you could just fold them into origami and rip them apart like paper. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI believed that back then. I believed that with all my heart.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut even though I believed, I still woke up the morning after the storm and slipped into the kitchen. I wanted to turn off the lights before my mother woke up. But when I walked in I saw something that turned my stomach into a weeping, bloody wound above my groin. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere was a black pile of dirt on the floor, right behind the kitchen table. Right where my man had been standing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd to this day I don’t know why I did it, but before I turned off the lights I took out a broom, swept up the dirt, and tossed it into the wastebasket. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\t\nI never mentioned it to anybody.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*[FILE CONTINUES IN DOC NO. 45-0897] (TBD)*",

In the middle of the frame, ridiculously small, hung a plain white banner. Slapped across it in red was a single word: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\##REPENT!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI shot past the sign shaking my head. My good spirits had been crushed like a boot stomping out the glowing embers of a fire. What was I doing, coming back to the town where I had lived as a boy, trying to catch something that was irrevocably lost? What could I possibly gain by walking the bricked (probably asphalted now) downtown streets, or going to the (probably long-closed) soda fountain, which seemed impossibly kitsch even then. What could be waiting for me at the end of this road besides a hundred different kinds of humdrum disappointment? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA flash of yellow caught my eye off to the left, and when I looked that way I felt a blast of pleasure and recognition. A large hill towered far across a plowed-flat field— the prehistoric consequence of a passing glacier, or maybe a yet-undiscovered Indian burial mound (there were lots in the area)— and right at its peak stood a familiar sunflower yellow barn. It was there then and it was here now, just as bright, probably re-painted by its owner every year. It looked exactly the same. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Shitcan eyesore!” I exclaimed with a grin, repeating my father’s long-ago slogan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen an overpass blotted it out. I looked for it in the rear view, knowing it wouldn’t reappear. Maybe it was going to be all right after all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI dropped my eyes to the road, pushing the accelerator as I did. I watched for the sign. Presently it came up and out of the distance, shimmering in metallic green.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVANDALIA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5 MILES\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe exit came up on the right, and for a moment I considered blowing right past it. I could stay on I-70 all the way to Effingham. A quick left would put me on 57. In two hours I would be hungry and I could stop for lunch in Champaign. I could drink in the college life, possibly flirt with a bored sorority girl or two. It wasn’t impossible. I’m still relatively trim and hell, dad bods are considered sexy now, right? After that I could head on to Chicago, with their overcrowded bars and irritatingly affordable apartments. It would be warm there. I could sunbathe at Montrose Beach, talk to some curiously friendly city folks, get invited to a house party, maybe hear about a place, a cute little one-bedroom in Lakeview, I could rent it, find a job that sends me a paycheck just before the money runs out…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI signaled, slowed the Enterprise rental, and went up the ramp. Toward the top, where a stoplight paused the traffic trying to enter US-51, I glanced down at my watch. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt had stopped. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI skirted town, taking Amblin Way to Rural Route 3, heading to the site of the old Wal-Mart. It had stood next to the interstate for two decades, alone except for a dirty Burger King a half-mile away. It was finally torn down a few years ago. Damaged in a tornado, they say. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mind wanted to speak up, but I would not let it. \\*Not yet. Please, not yet.\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was amazed by just how little things had changed out here. The road still curved down and around a hill and deposited my car on an insanely flat and straight road that, like an idiot child’s drawing, seemed to stretch on to infinity. On the right was still a vista of empty countryside. Its only feature besides brown dirt was a sign placed every mile or so that proclaimed, desperately, LAND FOR SALE. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turned left at Jefferson Street and after a short drive I saw it. I pulled over and got out of the car. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe grass grew wild and tall around the lot, obscuring the concrete parking stops that lined its perimeter. Buzzing cicadas droned in it, and I could see little green grasshoppers jumping back and forth in great confused arcs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe lot itself was tar-black. Faded parking lines wobbled crazily from the hot air rising off the asphalt. In the middle of the lot, about the size and shape of a New York City block, stood the empty grey foundation of what had once been the Vandalia Wal-Mart. Any sense of identity had been stripped away from it. The demolition team had taken the building, and years of rainstorms and heavy snow had washed off any marker that might have been left. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt a strong urge to walk over that hot blacktop, climb up the haphazard, cracking foundation, and retrace my old shopping route through the store. Here to the right were the rows and rows of empty shopping carts, and on past them was the grocery section. Then there was Seasonal Candy, and to the right of that were the clothes (no need to go that way) and ahead stood Homewares. If you hurried through there, then took a left at Greeting Cards, you would find yourself in Toys. That was the place to be. That was where you had sheltered during the tornado of ‘\\*\\*\\`XX\\`\\*\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI swallowed and stared at the lot, almost hypnotized. It stared back indifferently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDamaged by a tornado. Isn’t that funny. I had sheltered here once from a tornado. It was probably just dumb luck that the whole building hadn’t caved right in on my head. I had only been in one other tornado in my life, and that time I certainly wasn’t in a Wal-Mart. Like any respectable person, I had been at home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe spent all night huddled in the bathroom. Mom and I were in the tub, her with one ear glued to the wind-up radio she bought from the Rural King that morning. Minnie, our elderly dachshund, had thrown her shiny black body over both of us. She shivered and moaned uncontrollably. Sometimes she would roll her eyes up at us and sigh. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI only left the bathroom once that night, to get more batteries for my Game Boy. Looking back, I realize the worst of the storm must have been over. Why else would my parent let me walk through the house alone? But at the time I genuinely felt like I was taking my life in my hands. I remember closing the door to the bathroom behind me. It was like letting the door of a shallow crypt swing shut. I tip-toed through the house. Glass was rattling in every window. The storm howled outside. It wasn’t a movie sound either, it sounded like a voice, and sometimes it was many voices, and they were moaning right on the other side of the walls. It sounded like something \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(or some\\*things\\*)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwas trying to speak, pretending to be human. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe batteries were in the dry pantry next to the refrigerator. I had made the trip a million times before, sometimes two or three times a day. But the sounds, rain and howling, were foreign to my young ears. Strange too was the alien light spilling through the kitchen window. It was almost green, pulsing in an irregular tattoo, and its rays were cut into swirling ribbons by the great black storm clouds that were racing by overhead. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stood rigid on the kitchen threshold, one hand wrapped around the thin door casing in a death grip. I groped for the light switch. I hated feeling for a light switch in a dark room. I had the idea - a stupid idea, even for a kid - that while my fingers were running along the waxy wallpaper some horrible, clammy hand would settle lightly over mine...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Don’t be an idiot.\\* Nothing could live in the dark. Not in the dark my child mind imagined. To me the darkness somehow contained a whole different world, like an alternate dimension. It was a shadow world that lived just a breath away from our own, and if could reach it you would see terrible wonders. You could reach it if you sidestepped just a certain way. Or you could there by climbing into the right tree hole. You could accidentally fall into it, maybe, and then you would cross over and come face-to-face with all manner of crouched and lurking monsters; things that were all hairy and had rows and rows of overlapping razor teeth, and eyes that glowed with yellow bloodlust. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd these things that lived in the dark were hungriest for boymeat. Just the sight of my smooth and unbroken skin would drive them into a frenzy, and they would take me apart with their mouths and their hooked fingers and their teeth, slick and foamy, stringy with ravenous drool.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Dumbass!\\* What would my mom say, if she caught me like this? Here he is, your only son, straddling the doorway like a lover, his eyes squeezed shut, his teeth gritted, mouth stretched out so wide you can see that ragged hole left by the molar that fell out last week! Funny? Oh you better believe it! \\*Grab the Polaroid and snap a picture, Ma! Make sure to save that one for his wedding!\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t\n\nThe wind was chucking hail against the house. It sounded like fingers tapping inside the walls. The moan came again and this time it sounded like a thick, otherworldly chuckle. The window above the sink was suddenly lit up with roiling green-yellow light. Lightning. Shadows sprang up across the wall and they did a spooky \\*danse macabre\\* before laying down again behind the furniture. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy fingers found the switch. Thank God!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey snapped it-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-and nothing. No light!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Shit! The power!\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLightning again. The kitchen was lit in a flashbulb burst. It left a bleary snapshot on my retinas, not really sight but an afterimage that my mind held for several seconds after the light died away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomebody was standing in the corner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mental switchboard fizzled out, too overloaded to handle what I had seen. I just stood in the doorway, feeling my hand go slack and fall away from the switch, completely unable to stop it. My chest hitched up. The screams were too big to come out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\t\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was dressed in black. He wore a ski mask. It the kind you wore in winter, pulled over the head. His eye glowed through the oval holes. They were huge and glassy. Red embers flickered in the center of the pupils, which were huge and dilated in a way that later in life I would associate with a really good LSD trip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*There’s a man here,\\* my mind whispered. \\*There’s a man standing in your kitchen.\\* But that’s impossible, isn’t it? He wasn’t there a minute ago. And besides, the monsters can only live in the shadows, not the light. They die in the light. They have to stay in the dark. Right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realized with sickening horror that I could still see the man’s eyes floating in the dark. They were twin pinpricks of glowing crimson punched into the shadows over the table. Those eyes dimmed, then brightened, like a embers smoldering in a breeze. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA hallucination. It had to be. A mirage caused by the lightning. Like those black spots, the ones that float around after you get your school picture taken. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the eyes were there. They were fixed on me, curiously, like a tiger who’s suddenly noticed you at the zoo. And those eyes, so evil and so awful, were those eyes now floating towards me? No. Not possible. Sure, there could be a man standing in my house. It was very possible that his eyes were there, staring at me in the dark\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut those eyes couldn’t be floating towards me, not over the kitchen table that stood between us. \\*Over\\* it? Without moving it? Without his body touching the table in any way? Yet that’s just what they appeared to be doing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy paralysis broke and I did the only thing I could think of: I flicked the light switch again. It was an automatic motion, a reflex, I might have even hit it accidentally. I really can’t remember. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\t\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I do remember is the overhead light ignited. A blast of tungsten hit my eyes. Tears sprang and I had to shut them. My irises screamed. Then the fear hit me again and I wrenched my eyelids open.\n\n \n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\t\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut when I looked into the corner, through eyes burning and streaming tears, heart pumping crazy, leaping beats into my ears, when I looked, the corner was empty. There was no shadowy figure there, no man in black. There was just a patch of flowery, powder blue wallpaper, and a round-framed black-and-white photo of my grandmother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\t\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnder. Hiding under the table. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI bent over so fast that both knees popped like twin shotgun blasts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNothing. There was no figure hiding between the forest of table-and-chair legs. There were no black, dilated eyes staring at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hurried back to the bathroom without turning off the lights. I explained to my mother that actually, I was tired of my game and I didn’t like it anymore. Then I sat down in the tub and let her stroke my hair until she fell asleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turned away from the parking lot, shivering despite the heat. I put my hand on the warm hood of the rental car and listened to the \\*tick-tick-tick\\* of the engine. My eyes drifted back to Jefferson Street. It led, I knew, straight downtown. To Vandalia. The town was still here after all these years. Changed, yes, but here. It had waited for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got in the car, started it, and drove back up the hill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo, the man was not real. Monsters were not real. Things with glowing, hateful red eyes that grabbed you and pulled you into their world of fists and teeth and agony could not be real, not there, not in the same house where your mother stroked your hair and told you that she loved you. Those monsters only existed in the movies, and in books, and even then they were just flat men, two-dimensional, and if they did attack, you could just fold them into origami and rip them apart like paper. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believed that back then. I believed that with all my heart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut even though I believed, I still woke up the morning after the storm and slipped into the kitchen. I wanted to turn off the lights before my mother woke up. But when I walked in I saw something that turned my stomach into a weeping, bloody wound above my groin. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a black pile of dirt on the floor, right behind the kitchen table. Right where my man had been standing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd to this day I don’t know why I did it, but before I turned off the lights I took out a broom, swept up the dirt, and tossed it into the wastebasket. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n\t\n\nI never mentioned it to anybody.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\[FILE CONTINUES IN DOC NO. 45-0897\\] (TBD)\\*",

        "text": "In the November of 2020, I was officially appointed as the Education Secretary for the City of Horizontes Antagônicos, a small town located deep in the foggy, forested and hilly innards of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. I’m sending this to explain the motives behind the decision to cease the banishment of all activities related to the teaching of Arts and Crafts in the schools of Horizontes Antagônicos. \n\nBefore everything, I must state that the ban was not started during my administration, but several administrations before, by the Emergency Municipal Education Decree 12/76, by Mayor Rosas education secretary in the April of 1976. The decree was later turned into law with endorsement by the State Court of Justice and unanimous approval in the Town Hall. However, until 1989, this ban did not extend to private schools. By 1990, it applied to all educational institutions for children under 14. \n\nI had, since the beginning of the pandemic, been isolated in my family farm twenty-three kilometers away from the city, enjoying my retirement after teaching Pedagogy in the National University of Belo Horizonte for thirty-eight years. The reason I had chosen to abandon my good retired life was a letter sent by Mayor Mara Amaral, who was a childhood friend of mine. She said the city would be facing a major issue related to the public education, and a pedagogy expert would be needed. I was at first reluctant to accept such call, but the boredom of staying almost a year locked in my farm compelled me to accept the challenge. \n\nA few days before the mayor officially confirmed me as secretary, I returned to the city. That was still in November, just after her reelection. I had not served the city as the Education Secretary in her first term. Secretary Ferreira, a very educated and acknowledged old lady whom I did not meet personally but heard very good things about, did so. However, she retired after the reelection. Later, I found out she died shortly after retiring, but the cause of her death was not made public. When I arrived back in Horizontes Antagônicos, I was notified of state-wide changes that the municipality would be legally required to implement, one of them being the adoption of the teaching of Arts in their schools. Furthermore, the older city law was declared unconstitutional by the State Court a few months before.\n\n“It’s been a long time, Carlos.” Mayor Amaral said as I entered her office for the first time, a place where I would visit so many times afterwards. \n\n“Mara, how delightful it is to see you again. I am really grateful you have chosen me to this job. I know the difficulties we will face.” I said, coughing a bit. I had started smoking during the pandemic and it was already ruining my lungs. \n\n“Oh, I don’t think you know what we will be facing, Carlos. It is worse than it seems. Much worse.” She said. Mara seemed consternated. \n\n“I read the nationwide reports while in social isolation. Basically all the students of the country had to attend online classes for a year. This is very problematic for young children, and it is still not safe for them to return in person, COVID is still out of control and there’s no vaccine yet. I have been researching how we can improve this, maybe with hybrid classes, but…” She stopped me. \n\n“No, this is a problem we will have to face. But I’m afraid the problem I needed you for is way more dangerous.” The Mayor said. \n\n“Wh-What do you mean? School shootings? We have those in Brazil?” \n\n“No, it’s not that. You see, for some reason, a few decades ago, a law banned the teaching of Arts and Crafts in Horizontes Antagônicos for children. This law was recently repealed, and as soon as in-person classes return, we will be obligated to have Arts and Crafts in our curriculum, by State Law.” She sighed.\n\n“That’s easy to solve, Mara. I know a few teachers of Arts from Belo Horizonte, they’re probably out of job due to the Pandemic, we could bring them here, you know.” I smiled.\n\n“Carlos. I need you to find out why Arts and Crafts were banned back in 1976. I could not find anything that explained the reason. But you have way more contacts in the education area than I do. I think you could help me with this.” She said.\n\nA few days later, after I had rented a new apartment and was officially nominated as Education Secretary, I started looking into the matter. At first, it was pretty obvious to me what had really happened. In 1976, the Brazilian Military Dictatorship was in full bloom. A bloody bloom, must I say. People were being censored, tortured and murdered, all for the sake of battling communism. The military and the CIA were afraid the communists would takeover and install a dictatorship, so they took over and installed a dictatorship themselves. *Brilliant.* During those brutal times, all literary works which could make people use their own brains were forbidden. Even Cubism was forbidden, because Cubism was believed to come from Cuba, and Cuba was communist. I suspected this was the case with Arts and Crafts. That some blockhead thought artists were all socialist and decided to forbid the discipline altogether. \n\nHowever, this was not the case, as I soon discovered that after the regime fell, in 1990, the censorship was increased, and not stopped like in the rest of everything. Before 1990, private schools were still allowed to teach Arts and Crafts to children under 14. Something, indeed, strange was going on here. The worst part is that there was no justification whatsoever in any of the documents related to the ban. This was usual, standard practice, in documents issued during the Military Dictatorship, but not after the re-democratization. \n\nHorizontes Antagônicos is by no means a large city. I think it is not even above 70k inhabitants. But during the 70s it was much smaller. It had only three schools until the mid-90s. Two of them were municipal schools, one of them was private. Nowadays we have around then schools, most of them municipal. This is even a bit ironic, because most of the commerce here only exists because of a nearby federal university. \n\nI would soon find out my dear hometown is completely atrocious when it comes to record-keeping. The mayor was not joking, it was ridiculously hard to find any information regarding the ban. The city administration officials who could give me the answers were by now long dead. I could not find the records to teachers and principals or even students at the time, most data was missing. I literally tried to ask people who were studying there at the time, and half of them said “I don’t know”, “I don’t remember”, “Right, they abolished arts, I wonder why”, “Must have to do with the military regime”. The other time told me to talk to other people, who either referred me to yet more people or said they didn’t knew. \n\nIt took me for nearly one week of surveying records or asking around when I finally found a clue, even if not by my direct action. Through a possible massive game of Chinese whispers and gossiping, the information that I, the municipal secretary of education had been looking someone who was involved to the local schools in the year of 1976 for an interview had been morphed into the announcement that the Brazilian ministry of education would grant monetary rewards to school employees and students of the 1970s. Explaining to the gullible crowd that this was only a rumor was awful, and some of them gave me death states, but on the good side, a retired language teacher presented herself, even if she was very disappointed that she would not be getting money. \n\n“So, Mrs. Veneza, am I right?” I said, as I entered my office with a cup of coffee, where she was waiting for me, eating a biscuit one of the secretary’s staff brought her. \n\n“Yes, darling. It’s been long since anyone has had need of me for anything… Most of my life was kids needing me for all sorts of stuff you know. And now, since I retired, I’m mostly alone.” She lamented.\n\n“I know how it feels, Mrs. Veneza. I am also a teacher. Was, I mean. I retired not long ago.” I said as I drank the coffee.\n\n“So you must imagine my wonder when your staff told me the new secretary of education needed me! I don’t think I can be useful to you, however, Secretary Noronha. My Portuguese is completely outdated, it has been long since I last practiced Latin. We used to teach Latin before 64, you know. I also think we had a bit of an over-reliance on the paddle. If I recall correctly, corporal punishment is seen very badly nowadays…”\n\n“You are indeed right, Mrs. Veneza, but I have not called you here to interrogate on how you punished or not young kids, nor about languages. I need to know about another subject entirely, actually.”\n\n“Oh, I also taught Sewing. It was mandatory for girls. You want advice on implementing that again? I think you would need to teach sewing to the boys too, if you want…” I interrupted her politely.\n\n“No, no, it is also not about sewing. It’s actually about arts.” When I said that, she visibly shivered.\n\n“I-I d-don’t think I c-could help you with that, Mr. N-Noronha…” She stuttered. \n\n“Please, Mrs. Veneza. I couldn’t find a single record on why arts and crafts were outlawed. I couldn’t find anyone who remembered. You are the only teacher who was there, who can help me.” I said, almost begging.\n\n“Can’t you let that thing rest? Who needs arts? If they want, they can leave for a better course in a better town!” She complained.\n\n“There’s new state legislation, it requires us to implement Arts and Crafts in the curriculum. But if I am to reinstate this subject, I must first understand why it was forbidden.” \n\n“Fine, Secretary Noronha…” She looked around her shoulders, as if somehow checking if we were alone. “I will tell you what happened in 76. What I know at least. But in exchange, I want my retirement payment to be increased. It has not been updated to inflation for years.” She demanded.\n\n“I’ll tell the mayor to adjust it. Now, please, tell me what happened.” I said, finishing my coffee, almost breaking the porcelain cup in anticipation. \n\n“It was March, merely one month after school year began, the year was ‘76. I was teaching Portuguese and Sewing at the Ambassador Jean-Claude Moreau Municipal School. For convenience, we used to just call it Moreau.” She sighed, before proceeding. “You know, Jean-Claude Moreau was a French ambassador who moved here from the capital after retiring. He was the one who built the abandoned mansion in the woods to the north.” \n\n“I am familiar with Moreau’s story and the urban legends surrounding his mansion. I and my friends once spent a night there. Nothing out of the ordinary happened. I don’t know what this has to do with anything, besides.” I said, worried that she would start telling me old folklore that wouldn’t help me with anything. \n\n“Calm down, Mr. Noronha. The thing is, Moreau was the one who built the school I worked in during my time as a teacher. That’s why the school had his name. And he didn’t just help build it. Moreau donated his personal library to the school.”\n\n“What sort of books did he donate?” \n\n“Most of these books were French-Portuguese dictionaries and guides. In fact, the Moreau school taught French until the late 20s, and Moreau’s daughter was the teacher. But there were some books that were actual actual books, you know. Not mere dictionaries.”\n\n“Let me guess, everything was in French.”\n\n“Not everything. Some of the works were in English and even in Italian. But the former ambassador himself translated most of the books to Portuguese. At the time, Arts was part of Moreau’s curriculum. We would organize a new play every semester, to help the kids study literature, portuguese and to speak in public. There were several benefits arts had. And we used the books from the school library.” \n\n“Romeo and Juliet?” I giggled softly.\n\n“Moreau had several Shakespearean tales. Macbeth, the Merchant of Venice, King Lear, Julius Caesar… But we had to make several adaptations in the plays. After all, we were talking about a 12-year old cast.” \n\n“I think I know what happened. One of the parents said the play was too violent, and they forced the city hall to ban arts. Did I get it right?” \n\n“Oh, if only it was that. I’m afraid the truth is much darker.” She sighed before continuing: “There was a play… That was very different from the others. Shakespeare, Sophocles, the Grimm Brothers, even good old Edgar Allan Poe. All of them paled in comparison to that. This play… It was never meant to be read by children. It… I don’t think it was ever meant to be read by anyone.” \n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“That play was a work of the most impure production of the decadent movement. But I remember wondering if it wasn’t even older. Maybe as old as Shakespeare. It was a strange story, very abstract. And it…” She looked around, confirming if we were really alone. “It was cursed, Mr. Noronha. No, not cursed. Worse than that. That play was nefarious. It seemed alive sometimes. I read it. It’s meaning changed… The meaning of the words, the mental image it generated, they adapted themselves to the reader.” \n\n“You are saying the text changed on it’s own?” I asked, wondering if trusting that woman was really a good choice. \n\n“The text never changed as far as I know, but the words were structured in ways to create new meanings. When I first read that book, I was terrified, because the book described me as one of the guests in the ball scene, and I knew the author was talking about me specifically. Even if the text was way older than me.”\n\n“It is common for a reader to identify him or herself with a story’s character, Mrs. Veneza. But I think I see what you’re getting at. The play was performed by the kids in 1976. I guess parents read the source material and were horrified, and moral panic ensued.” \n\n“Worse than that, Mr. Secretary. It was a terrible mistake. The Arts teacher in ‘76 was a new one, an old army colonel sent by the regime “vanished” the previous teacher, if you know what I mean. This new teacher was a soldier, not a teacher. He just picked a random book and gave it to the kids to act as they saw fit. But he picked the book… The book of the King. The book that should never be read.” She sighed sadly, as if she somehow felt guilty. “I warned him of the risks. That book was too much for the children. I even tried to hide it, but he had locked the library’s door. Something happened then. You know, similar to this Covid thing, but psychological. The children became obsessed with the play. Most of them failed their tests or stopped their hobbies. All they talked about was about this damned King and his court and tatters and the black stars.”\n\n“Why didn’t you or the teachers or the parents do anything?” \n\n“The thing is, even if the old colonel didn’t care a bit about books or arts, watching the rehearsals affected him. He became obsessed with the book himself, talking about it all the time and asking the children to read it for him. One of the teachers told him that this was getting dangerous, the children were too obsessed and were failing their grades. The next day three army officers came to that teacher’s house, they took her to an abandoned warehouse and electrocuted her for hours. They released her, but her hands never stopped trembling. Never.” \n\n“But it was the regime itself that banned Arts and Crafts, wasn’t it? What happened?”\n\n“After three months, the spectacle was ready. At that point, students didn’t even come to the other classes anymore, but the colonel ordered us teachers to give them good grades at gunpoint. When the play was ready, all parents came to watch. Not only the parents, their entire families and even friends. Never one of our plays had such a large audience. I don’t know why so many people came. I and the other teachers were also there. I was glad that this whole thing was going to finally end, but I also had this feeling… That something bad was going to happen.”\n\n“And did it?”\n\n“Yes… The play was bizarre. As I said, this book creates new, multiple meanings for every words, but the play was completely next-level. I didn’t know 12-year olds were capable of acting in such a profane way, but they did. The play had no scenarios, yet the contorted towers were higher than any skyscraper, and the lake’s water was black and cold like ice. This play was so, so violent. No horror movie I ever saw was that violent. I mean, the first act is not very disturbing, only a bit. But the second…”\n\n“Did any child get hurt?”\n\n“Hurt, Mr. Noronha? The children were quartering, hanging and eating each other while their parents watched, hypnotized. While we watched, unable to do anything. The actual play was even more violent than the script. Of all the meanings of the words, the colonel had chosen the most violent ones. It was a festival of flesh and depravity.”\n\n“You can’t be serious.”\n\n“It got worse when the King appeared. At first I thought he was the colonel, but then I noticed he was carrying the colonel’s dead body. The King wore several tattered traps, and an yellow mantle. When he opened his arms, we saw the purple vortexes of infinity. As I heard all members of the audience fighting each other, I fell to the floor. I had a stroke.” \n\n“And what happened next?” I inquired, even if I was afraid of the answers.\n\n“When I woke up, three months had passed. No one but me and three other people left the school theater alive that day. Agents came to my hospital bed, asking what I remembered. I told them “Nothing.” And it was true, at the time, I didn’t remember anything. It took several months for my memory to really come back. I later was told about the three other surviving audience members. One of them escaped unscathed, two of them had several broken limbs and bones. One even lost an eye. The same agents when to their hospital beds and to the escapee’s house, and they vanished. Then… It became taboo to talk about arts. The population was told the school was targeted by a communist terrorist attack. At the end I was the sole survivor.” \n\n“Wa-Wait… Who was the King?” I asked, trembling. I suddenly felt observed, and started looking around, to confirm if we were alone.\n\n“The King? The King was the King, Mr. Noronha. He was simply there.” She said, as she got up. “It is dangerous to mention his work like I did. I am telling this so you don’t get any ideas about Arts and Crafts.” \n\n“Wait, Mrs. Veneza! I need to know more.” I said, sweating.\n\n“Mr. Noronha, I was wrong when I thought the spectacle would be the end of it. It wasn’t. The regime tried desperately to silence anyone who knew the truth, even banning arts and crafts to prevent more incidents. You know why? Because the play had tainted the town. Look at drawing children do, even nowadays. Look at what they write. Look at their games. Hide and seek, for an example. They love to play that game, but if you ask any of the children, nobody will know who was the one seeking them. They will only say none of them were doing that task, but there was a kid playing with them and seeking them.” She went in the door’s direction.\n\n“But if nobody knew, why did they ban Arts from private schools in the ‘90s?” I asked.\n\n“They didn’t know what, but everyone knew something horrible happened because of theatrical arts and children, Mr. Noronha. And no one was eager for something like that to happen again.”\n\n“Wait, Mrs. Veneza… Where can I read the book?” I pleaded. She looked right in my eyes.\n\n“Be careful, Mr. Noronha. You are playing a dangerous game. I see the same madness in your eyes that I saw on the colonel’s. It is not a book. It is a curse. And like Nietzsche said, if you stare at the abyss too much, it stares back at you.” She said as she left.\n\nI wish I had listened to her. But the truth was, somehow, I got fascinated with all of that. I needed to know more, I needed to see this book. I will not write the book’s name, but I needed to read it. I looked in every library, even in nearby towns, in the internet, but I couldn’t find it anywhere. But the book found me. One day, I was awoken by someone knocking on the door of my rented apartment. It was nearly midnight. I opened the door, and saw a small child, I think she had four or five years. She wore an yellow skirt and was barefoot. She asked me to follow her. And so I did. She took me to a small playground behind an abandoned school, it had an yellow tent raised above it. There were three other small children there, drawing. There were several drawings on the broken walls of the school, of a strange being on an strange city, wearing an yellow or white clothing that covered his body entirely. \n\n“Where am I?” I asked the child, but she was not there anymore. All children had disappeared, but I found something where they previously were. In the damp earth, full of dirt, laid a hardcover yellow book. It’s title was “Kingdom Come”. I grabbed it, and suddenly I woke up in my bed again. Was it all a dream? It seemed like that, until I went to have breakfast, and found the book laying on my kitchen table. \n\nBefore I read, I did not know words could have such profound, incomprehensible meaning, but dare I say, this book was not written using language, it is more like a picture book, a printed artistic portfolio, but without pictures. The sentences and words in that book were structured in a way that every single sentence had five or six completely different meanings at the same time, some of them completely disturbing or hazardous. I didn’t show up to work that day. Or the next. I spent two entire days reading and re-reading the book. Without going to the bathroom, without drinking anything, without eating anything, without sleeping. Three days later, I woke up in a hospital bed, having collapsed from exhaustion.\n\nI was angry, I was so angry. I was so angry at the state for forbidding children of accessing what is the greatest work of art ever written. The mayor gave me two weeks-off, they suspected I became afflicted with Covid and that’s why I nearly died in my apartment. When I went back to my house, the book had vanished. But I knew it would come back eventually, when the time was right.\n\nNow, it wasn’t easy. The year of 2021 was entirely with online classes, but in 2022, things got better. In-person classes returned, and I oversaw the reinstatement of Arts and Crafts. Some older folks were scared, but so far there were no incidents, and they became more and more relaxed. I successfully managed to convince everyone that Arts and Crafts were banned because of the dumb military censorship. And I see him getting closer. The drawings the children paint are always filled with yellow elements. When they write essays, the King is always there, hidden among the words. Waiting, biding his time. Yes, I had to silence Mrs. Veneza. It was easy. I just showed her a small picture made by one of the children, of a beautiful yellow symbol, and she had a heart-attack right there.\n\nThe time is getting closer. In a few days, classes will start again. The book appeared yesterday on my doorstep. I know what I have to do. The Kingdom is definitely coming, and no one will stop me, for I will spread his gift.\n\n.- ...- . --.. -....- ...- --- ..- ... / ...- ..- / .-.. . / .--. .- -. -. . .- ..- / .--- .- ..- -. . ..--..",

        "text": "I was a complete moron for staying at the summit as long as I did, no doubt about that. By the time I started back the sky had turned dark indigo and the distant peaks were silhouettes.\n\nThe slope carried me across a crest on the side of a giant mountain. There was a steep drop along both sides, and with every step I took pebbles broke off the trail. You could tell it was a long way down by the sound they made tumbling into the fog, out of sight. I tried not to think about the jagged rock beds waiting for me at the bottom.\n\nYep, no doubt about it, I was an absolute idiot. On the way up, a bunch of experienced hikers warned me about ‘hanging about’ too long—said dusk would roll around fast.\n\nIf only I’d listened…\n\nOver the course of the next thirty minutes, the sky turned from purple to black, and this silvery mist drifted across the landscape, limiting my visibility to thirty metres or so. It started feeling claustrophobic, despite being outside and all, and I kept second-guessing whether I’d actually come that way.\n\nThat’s not even mentioning the jerky winds and the weight of my pack, which by now felt much heavier than 15 lbs.\n\nMy phone couldn’t get a signal but worked okay as a flashlight. I waved it in low arcs while doing some quick sums in my head.\n\nThe climb took three hours, accounting for water breaks, and I’d only started down forty-five minutes earlier. Yeah, no matter what way you sliced it, there was a long way to go.\n\nThe ridge swung left, then right, then left again. At some points it became so wide four people could march along side-by-side, at other times I almost had to do an impression of a tightrope walker.\n\nThanks to the gusts of wet air, I didn’t hear the footsteps until they were close by. By that stage my light barely dented the fog, which looked thicker than gruel.\n\nI stopped, listened closely. Just a gust of wet air. I started along again.\n\nTen seconds later a huge pebble cascaded noisily into a ditch up ahead. Did *another* moron hang around too long? Maybe they had a phone that wasn’t a complete piece of shit and could actually get signal.\n\n“Hello?” I shouted. No reply. Only more air.\n\nI broke into a jog. If I could catch up with another hiker—one who felt more confident about the route—my electrified nerves could take a rest, at least.\n\nA blob took shape in the mist. I repeatedly shouted ‘hello’ as it morphed into the outline of a figure, roughly my height.\n\nI yelled for their attention, arms waving overheard. They waved back.\n\nAlready feeling the hardness in my stomach melt away, I eased into a trot and said, “You have no idea how happy I am there’s somebody else up here. For a minute I thought I’d gone the wrong way.”\n\nFrom that distance, I could tell they were facing me. I said, “Is this the fastest route back to—”\n\nAs the figure became clearer against that icy sheet, both it and I froze, our arms suspended in mid-air. Slowly, I let my left hand drop against my side. The shadow did the same. I stepped forward, then back, then off to the side. It did as well.\n\nI was staring at my own silhouette.\n\nOkay, there had to be a scientific explanation for this. Didn’t I read about broken spectres once? Yeah, they’re the shadow of an observer cast in mid-air upon any type of cloud opposite a strong light source. Makes sense.\n\nI took a single step forward. So did the shade. That was fine, you’d expect that to happen. Trick of the light and all…\n\nI took another, slower step. Then another. And another.\n\nUp ahead, the figure emerged from the fog. Now, I could make out navy hiking trousers, a red woolly hat, a fluorescent jacket, and a black backpack.\n\nThe same outfit as me.\n\nAfter another cautious step I saw strands of dark hair poking out beneath the hat, along with a set of green eyes, and the thin, dented nose that had greeted me in the bathroom mirror every morning since my tenth birthday, when I busted my face trying to do a wheelie on my new bike.\n\nThe figure wasn’t my silhouette—it was a carbon copy.\n\nI lifted my right leg. Other me did the same. My left hand whipped from side-to-side, twisted at the wrist, testing whether that *thing* imitated these movements.\n\nIt did.\n\nI swallowed a gulp. “Hello?”\n\nThe duplicate's mouth moved, although no words came out. For a while, we stood there frozen in place, a showdown.\n\nAs I punched the number for mountain rescue into my phone, my counterpart tapped the air with its forefinger. I still couldn’t get a signal.\n\nOkay, so this *wasn’t* a trick of the light. Did that mean I’d lost my mind?\n\nI opened the camera app and snapped some pictures. The results were all blurred because my stupid hands wouldn’t quit shaking. My brain swung back and forth on whether there was actually a person in those photos.\n\nI decided that even if the thing *was* real—which it wasn’t—the trail ahead looked too risky anyway. If I kept going, I’d slip and fall, then, in the morning, one of those early bird hikers would find me impaled on a rock. Or maybe they'd spot *other* me first, and summon mountain rescue to cart the body off in a helicopter, maybe even arrange a little funeral…\n\nI shook these thoughts away. There was zero chance I’d arrived by that path. I needed to double back and find the right one.\n\nI backstepped until the fog swallowed my counterpart, spun around, and followed the ridge up and up, leg muscles burning.\n\nThe temperature continued to drop. Soon the air felt like acid in my lungs, and my ears began burning. I’d wasted too much time already. I needed to get off the mountain and someplace warm.\n\nAfter a fifteen-minute jog, my pack bouncing up and down on my shoulders, the ridge connected with a Y-shaped slope. This time, I took the other route.\n\nThe new trail felt more familiar. Steadier. I broke into a run, confident I’d be back at the hostel sipping hot chocolate in no time.\n\nBut soon the edges of the walkway tapered off. I slowed my pace, mindful not to slip, and as I did there came a shuffle of steps up ahead.\n\nAnd then, like before, a silhouette filled the blank sheet of fog.\n\nOkay, this *had* to be my imagination. There was no other plausible explanation. My arms shot up and down, confirming the doppelganger still mimed these actions. It did. I couldn’t decide whether that was a good or bad thing.\n\nThe silhouette stood there, mouth all tight, eyes narrow. What the hell did I do now?\n\nI weighed my options for a while before giving the phone a few more tries, even held it way up overhead. Still nothing. I was cut off. Isolated. Alone.\n\nI’ll go slow, I kept telling myself. If I turned sideways, me and *other* me could slip right by one another, right? What other option was there? Wait until frostbite set in?\n\nI shuffled along, my pulse banging between my ears. One slow, unsteady step followed another. But then, when only twenty metres of trail separated us, I froze.\n\nWhat the hell was I thinking? I’d seen this horror movie a million times before. Better to stay perched at the summit until dawn rather than let this scene play out, even if it meant risking hypothermia.\n\nMy clone stood there with its face tensed. I doubled back, frequently glancing over my shoulder until the figure melted into the gloom, and then jogged back toward the summit.\n\nThe temperature plunged even further. Now icy fingers caressed the back of my neck, massaged my earlobes.\n\nTo my horror, the silhouette appeared *up* the stony hill five minutes later. Despite already knowing what was about to happen, I continued on until the clone drifted into view.\n\nI spun around, sprinted back. I’d let the fear and panic disorient me, that’s all.\n\nIt wasn’t long before the footsteps started up again. Another ten strides and the silhouette re-emerged.\n\nStill in denial, I went back and forth six times. With every turn, my counterpart appeared sooner and sooner. Now I couldn’t go five minutes without hearing pebbles crunch under heavy boots.\n\nThis *had* to be a nightmare.\n\nI pounded my temples, clomped my feet, and told myself to wake up, wake up, wake up. My counterpart mimicked these actions.\n\nThe wind bit into my extremities. Now simply holding the phone took a concentrated effort. My swollen red fingers looked fatter than plump sausages.\n\nMy only option was passing the replica. But hey, it was only a phantom, right? A figment of my imagination. Maybe in the future I’d visit a doctor, explain what happened, and they’d reveal I had a brain tumour…\n\nI drew chilled air into my lungs and then shuffled along, inch by terrible inch. Soon there were only twenty metres between us. Fifteen. Ten.\n\nI slowed way down. Then, as the two of us closed in one another, I pivoted inward, facing the left side of the drop-off. My mirror image swung right, our heels hovering over the edge of the pits. At that distance, we’d still have been able to reach out and shake hands. Not ideal.\n\nI took a single sideward step. Then another. And another. And, as we drifted closer, the corners of my companion’s mouth turned up.\n\nAfter two more steps I could make out the beginnings of a smirk. My feet remained locked in place as my top half leaned forward.\n\nFor every inch that closed between me and it, that mouth grew wider, spreading into a full-on ear-to-ear grin. An invisible ice pick stabbed my insides.\n\nI sidestepped in reverse, my peer's face reverting to a look of terror, followed by confusion. Once we reached a safe distance I tried making a fist but couldn’t. Pressing forward was my only option.\n\nAfter failing to get my breathing under control, I sidestepped along, quicker this time, my arms up in a t-pose.\n\nAs the distance shrunk, my counterpart’s lips curled back revealing a smile so wide and deep you could count the individual teeth. Except, they didn’t look like *my* teeth—more like yellow canines surrounded by black gums.\n\nThe figure's eyes widened and flicked about, as though it had been looking forward to this moment for years. *Come a little closer*, the expression said, *I promise I’m not gonna hurt you…*\n\nI couldn’t retreat again. Not unless I wanted the authorities to tell my family they discovered two identical icicles. In an attempt to create more space, I edged so far back that only my toes remained on solid ground. That grinning bastard did the same.\n\nMy entire body tensed up, hard. I hunched forward, my head down and to the side. Just a few more steps…\n\nBut now there was something happening to *other* me. The flesh along its cheeks began bubbling, and dark patches grew across the neck and forehead. The facial muscles jerked and twitched, going crazy with spasms, laughing soundlessly. Pink froth shot out of that opened mouth and sprayed across my cheeks. It’s warm, rancid breath made a moist sickness slide up my throat.\n\nOne more step and we’d come face-to-face.\n\nI clenched my jaw and forced myself to press on. And, as our heads aligned, the skin on the face opposite mine tore away, as though gouged by invisible fingernails. Soon there was only exposed cartilage and veins, with patches of bone shining through.\n\nThe two of us stared at each other, our breaths perfectly synchronized. For a moment I thought I was about to make it—that I just had to order my legs to take one more step.\n\nBut then my twin’s head rattled from side-to-side, swaying too far in either direction as if loose at the neck. Without meaning to I yelped, felt my balance go, and then windmilled both arms around. My counterpart did the same. This action carried both our bodies over opposite sides of the trail.\n\nBeneath my boots, clods of dirt broke apart and tumbled into the void. For a moment I became weightless but, at the very last second, my numb hands shot out and fumbled for the trail\n\nBy some miracle, I held on. With barely working fingers I clawed my way back to solid ground, so happy to be alive I almost forgot about the mimic.\n\nIt took a few seconds before my brain kicked in and screamed: wriggle sideways. I did this while still hoisting myself back up and then belly crawled along, down summit. When there were a few metres between me and my counterpart, I scrambled to my feet, still breathless, and backstepped away. Other me retreated in the opposite direction until the fog enveloped him, and then I spun on my heels and tore down the trail.\n\nWithin minutes the slope widened. I started half-running half-falling, but my legs refused to slow down, even when the path connected with the valley below. Whenever the first signpost for the hostel appeared, I almost cried.\n\n[I still don’t know what the hell that thing was.

        "text": "I ended up in a dead bedroom relationship at 33. For those of you lucky enough to be unfamiliar with the term, it means my wife won’t fuck me. I don’t know if she fell out of love, doesn’t find me attractive anymore or just lost her libido as she got older. She won’t say. Doesn’t matter, the result is the same: blue balls. \n\nIn fact, my wife, Kasey, had been silent on the subject of her faking sleep when I tried to initiate sex up until a few weeks ago. I was in our apartment, taking advantage of a balmy day in Anaheim by reading with the window open when she came up to me and sat on the floor cross-legged, an indication she meant business. \n\n“So…” said Kasey “I’ve been thinking of what we can do to spice up the bedroom…” \n\nI raised my brow and closed my book. “I wasn’t sure you’d even noticed things needed spicing up,” I said a little too aggressively. \n\nShe ignored me, thankfully, and continued. “There’s a ritual I want to try. It’s serious though…”\n\nNow, I should preface this by mentioning my wife is into witchcraft. It’s been pretty sick, she’s brought dead birds back to life, hexed my exes. Hell, she’d even used her skills once before in the bedroom to alter our minds so we switched bodies. (I have experienced the female orgasm.)\n\nSuffice to say when she mentioned “ritual” in a sexual context I beat the Boy Scout record for pitching a tent. \n\nMy book went sliding down my lap and thumped on the floor as I reached out and took her hand. “What’s your idea?”\n\n“Look, it’s going to be more work than sex for a little bit, but I want to summon something.”\n\n“And what’s that?” \n\n“Zoth-Ommog,” she said, staring into my eyes. “Third son of Cthulhu.” \n\n“Umm babe. Come on,” I laughed. Kasey had opened my eyes to a lot of things witchcraft I previously thought impossible, but they weren’t as outlandish as summoning a monster. I always thought deep down there was a reasonable explanation for her witchcraft success. Like she was some sort of magician who hid her tricks. \n\nThe birds were never really dead, my ex-girlfriends had shitty luck, she gave me ecstasy and LSD before pinning my legs up and pegging me with a Bad Dragon. Etcetera. \n\nBut this? Summoning an actual monster? It felt like she didn’t have what it took to pull this out of her sleeve. \n\n“Isn’t Cthulhu like as big as a skyscraper? How are you going to summon him in our two- bedroom apartment?”\n\n“Cthulhu and his offspring can alter their size at will. As small as a worm or as big as a world.” The matter of fact tone she spoke in caused me to laugh again, but there was something deathly serious about her expression. \n\n“Fine, what does this ritual involve?” \n\nShe gave me the low down and let me tell you it did not sound sexy. Essentially, one person had to perform the ritual while the other person essentially *was* the ritual. I would have hot wax poured on me… things put in me… and apparently Zoth-Ommog was aquatic. We had to do something with our coffee percolator and a water tank so he could even breath. \n\n“Babe can’t we start… slower. Get intimate with each other once again before we jump to something like this?”\n\nWith that Kasey jumped up. “Absolutely not. For this to work I need at least a month of abstinence.” \n\nI felt relived yet conflicted at the same time. We’d had a dead bedroom for 4 months. Maybe she was being extra safe and had this ritual in mind since she started not sleeping with me. \n\nI sighed and leaned back in my chair. “Can I think about it?” She just stared at me coldly. I waved my hand in front of her face. “Hello?” \n\n“Fine. You can think about it. But if you don’t make up your mind quick, I’m blocking your number and staying at my sisters. Besides, I can always do this with Mark.”\n\nMy cheeks burned. Mark occupied our apartment’s 2nd bedroom. Although he’s just our roommate now, we were in a poly relationship for a while before I cut it off. At first, an open relationship seemed like a dream. I thought I’d be banging hot chicks left and right, but it turns out that’s a lot harder than I thought. \n\n“Hey, hey, hey. Don’t do anything with Mark. That’s like… not cool man.” \n\n“We don’t have much time. You don’t get it, I’ve been receiving dreams from the cosmos to summon Zoth-Ommog, third son of Cthuhlu. And when this lunar cycle ends so does my chance.”\n\nI held up my hands, a bit sketched out. “Just let me think about it.” \n\nShe just spun on a heel and left the room. \n\nOk, so I didn’t have a great relationship. But all my other girlfriends I tried to go poly with said no. I wanted to have my cake and eat it too. And I deserve that. Ladies have never understood what a catch I am. In a world of assholes, I’m an actual nice guy. \n\nI went for walk to clear my head. Did I really want this? I was so conflicted I walked and walked until long past sunset. I got back late, very late. After midnight. Kasey’s shoes were gone, and I panicked that she went to spend the night at her sister’s. I sent her a frantic text.\n\n“I’ll do it! I’ll do it, ok? Let’s summon this thing.” \n\nShe didn’t respond. We were both night owls and I figured she was still awake. She left me on read. I went into my bedroom and exhausted from walking a dozen miles, fell into a deep sleep.  \n\nI woke to a door slamming. I realized Kasey must be home. A few minutes later, our bedroom door opened, and I felt the covers being pulled off me. I had agreed to this, so I had to take it. \n\nI must admit, I was actually fairly aroused for the first bit. She left the lights off thankfully but my arousal was soon assaulted from the stench of ammonia and other stink that filled the room as things got hotter and heavier.\n\nKasey was soaked in lube and angry, she turned me over like I was weightless. I won’t get into the nitty gritty, but the Bad Dragon must’ve been brought out again. When it was over, I didn’t think I’d walk for days. \n\nThe bed creaked as her weight left it and Kasey closed the door behind her. I lay panting on the bed, relived that some of the things she’d mentioned in her ritual like hot candle wax were left out. \n\nI went out to the kitchen and when I reached the refrigerator I paused, confused. There was a note hung under a magnet; in Kasey’s handwriting it read,\n\n“Went to my sister’s. It’s already done so don’t bother texting.”\n\nI frowned and opened my phone. Kasey hadn’t responded to my text but that wasn’t out of the ordinary. “Kasey?” I said aloud. Her shoes weren’t by the door. She’d left again. I called her and she picked up on one of the last rings. \n\n“What do you want?” she said, annoyed. \n\n“Hey, where’d you go? I can’t even get some post-summoning sex cuddles?”\n\nI frowned as there were heavy, slithering footsteps behind me, but I didn’t dare turn around. Suddenly, my mind began to put the pieces into place.\n\n“What the fuck are you talking about?” asked Kasey.\n\nSomething leaked down onto my shoulder—a gloppy saliva that looked like lube. There was something very large behind me now, that reeked of ammonia and sucked in strange, labored breaths. \n\n“I’m talking about the m- monster summoning. The sex we just had...”\n\n“What sex?” Kasey snapped. “Didn’t you read the note on the fridge? I did it with Mark. He’s summoned already and resting in Mark’s room—and don’t you dare wake him.” \n\n“Umm… wake who?” But I knew. Oh, I knew.\n\n“Who do you fucking think?” thundered Kasey. “Zoth-Ommog, third son of Cthuhlu.”\n\n“Oh, pfft. You really believe in that magic crap? You Lovecraftian fangirl, get fucked!”\n\nI hung up on her and tossed the phone on the counter as the words “get fucked” echoed through my head. It was make believe. Fairy tales. It all came from the imagination of a man.\n\n“Right?” I said aloud but just then a starfish-like limb slithered down my back and spanked my bottom.  \n\n“Right,” I said quieter. My voice quivering [this time.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thespookyplace/)",

        "text": "After a *very* long walk home last night, I was exhausted. It was well past midnight, so I decided to just go right to sleep. I refilled my cat’s automatic feeder, gave her some love and treats, and passed out. I then had one of the worst nightmares I’ve ever had.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my dream, I woke up in the shop, but everything was wrong. The walls were cracked, the floor was warped, and everything was covered in mold. All of the clothing and furniture was gone, and the shop was completely empty. Somehow, I was completely unaffected by this, and thought nothing of it. There was a false sense of peace, and I knew deep down something was wrong, but on the surface, it felt completely normal. I wandered around for a bit, before finding myself in the breakroom. I noticed the air vent was open, and climbed up inside with no hesitation. I felt a tinge of panic as I tried to squeeze my shoulders through, but the walls of the vent opened up, as if welcoming me. I relaxed, and crawled around, following different paths almost on instinct. It felt like hours passed, and at one point, I looked down a tunnel and saw Sam. I waved to him, and he simply glared at me and scurried away. His quickness caused me to start panicking again, but right on cue, I saw a vent to my right pop open, and I hopped down into a room lit with candles. This room seemed like a deep relief compared to the suffocating air vent, and I felt that false ease once again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked at the space around me, squinting to find any indication of where I was, when a familiar face approached a candle, illuminating her. Meredith stood before me, the light reflecting off her eyes. They looked similar to Patrick and Daniel’s eyes when Corey was in their mind, but worse. There was no color to them at all, and I could see the dense fog swirling in almost hypnotizing patterns. When she spoke, her voice was crystal clear, but completely different than when she had spoken to me on the other side. It was strained, like she had been screaming for hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Why did you do this to me?” She asked, with no emotion at all. I was still unafraid, but confused. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What did I do?” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Your stupid tricks trapped me in this world. I can no longer find peace. You will leave this place and never return. If you try to return-” her head twitched, and I saw the fog in her eyes moving erratically, “If you try to return, you will - you will be risking the lives of yourself and - and - and -”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was fully twitching, like a video stuck in a loop, and the darkness fell away and revealed the sea of souls. I looked around and saw nothing but endless water, but noticed shapes emerging. Growing closer, bodies were floating to the top of the water before standing up right and walking towards me. They were not menacing, but I felt fear creeping up my spine. I turned back to Meredith, and saw Thomas rise from the water behind her. He put his hand on her shoulder and turned her to face him, before giving her a gentle kiss. She looked at him as he pulled away, and I saw the fog leave her eyes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Thomas?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello, love.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey embraced, tears streaming down their faces. I noticed the people rising from the water were getting closer, staring at me, and I began to panic once again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Meredith, Thomas, where am I?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You are in your home, dear,” Meredith said, wiping her tears, “but your soul was transported to this place. I believe our captor brought you here. I assume you have been attempting to help dear Eleanora, and she didn’t like that?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI nodded my head solemnly, feeling shame at my failure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“It’s alright, your time is not done yet. She is scared, I could feel it when she was inhabiting me. She knows you can stop this, and she is desperate to be rid of you. Lucky for you, Thomas knows how to return your soul to your body.” She turned to him and smiled lovingly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I will help you,” he said, giving me a stern look, “but you must be more careful. Cover your tracks. Convince this monster she has scared you enough, that you are giving up. As you now know, she can take control of you. You must not let her. Avoid her gaze and do not spend time alone with her. Stay with someone who is familiar to you, someone you know is safe, and keep each other that way.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI nodded quickly, trying to seem confident. He turned to the sea of people standing before us, and said something I couldn’t hear. The people looked at me, and I finally noticed them fully. They were all mutilated to different extents. Some were missing limbs, others eyes, some were brutally burnt, others had large patches of skin completely missing. I held back a scream, and thankfully, Thomas didn’t seem to notice. They nodded at him, then me, and slowly fell backwards. They created a path, and Thomas walked across them, looking back at me, motioning for me to follow. I turned to Meredith one last time, and felt tears welling in my eyes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Thank you, and I’m sorry,” I sobbed. It was the only thing I could think of, and I hoped it was enough to let her know that I wouldn’t give up on her. She gave me a sad smile, and waved me off, before returning to the sea of souls. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI followed Thomas silently for what felt like an eternity. We did not speak, and I tried my best to not look at my feet or the people forming my bridge back to my world. They did not seem to mind, though, and part of me believed they couldn’t feel anything at all, but that thought didn’t stop the sound of my feet on their wet skin. Finally, we reached a small island. I stepped ashore, and saw my bedroom door, standing solitary on the island barely large enough to hold it. I turned to Thomas, hoping for an explanation, but he was already returning the way we came. I didn’t call to him. I wanted him to return to Meredith, I had a feeling they had been separated since she first spoke to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI approached the door cautiously, and looked all around it, figuring there would be nothing until I opened it. Hesitantly, I pulled the handle, and there I was, asleep in my bed. I approached my body, looking at myself from above. I couldn’t help but think how sad and small I looked, but lost my train of thought when I noticed my cat staring at me. Not my physical body, but me, *my soul* I supposed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Can you see me?” I whispered, and she chirped softly in response. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Great,* I thought, *so that’s why you stare at nothing all the time. Love that.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI slid myself into bed next to my body, and felt a pull as I lined myself up. I closed my eyes, and when I reopened them, I was back in my own skin. I looked around, and began sobbing. I was completely overwhelmed with my entire experience, and didn’t even know what to think. After a long cry, I collected myself and reached for my phone, planning on making a to-do list for my day off to distract from my ‘dream’. When I checked the time, though, it was 4 hours before my shift started. I ‘slept’ through an entire day, almost 30 hours. I didn’t feel rested at all, but I was hit with a wave of hope. Meredith and Thomas, and every other soul trapped in that universe, was counting on me to free them from Corey. They know I can do it, so I decided to believe I can do it as well. I decided to make a plan, and it started with one simple thing:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wrote my two week notice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10f01tb/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_not_all_of_my_clients/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10g4sge/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_most_of_the_time_the/)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10h0wyd/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_were_stuck_on_the/)\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10idlz0/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_corporate_came_for_an/)\n\n[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10j6j47/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_i_actually_made_my/)\n\n[Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10k0nbh/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_i_finally_got_some/)\n\n[Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10lf2zd/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_i_have_a_plan_but_its/)",

        "text": "Back in 2015, I spent my summer at a christian summer camp. It wasn’t really a christian camp more or less just a regular summer camp but with an hour of church service by a campfire every morning and the rest of the day spent doing actual summer camp things.\n\nI mention this because during my summer there I met a kid, we’ll call him “Allen.” \n\nAllen was a pure athlete, dominated in all sports activities at the camp. He was a 6’2 11 year old at the time I met him. He played AAU basketball and soccer and went to a private K-12 christian academy about a 2 hour drive across the state from where the camp was. \n\nI was 12 years old when I met Allen and we are still friends to this day. I’m 19 and he’s 18 in his last year of highschool. \n\nAround the time I was 13, I had to start picking between High Schools as my state has many different options for high schools you can attend. I was leaning down to 2 options. A tech school where I could go and learn my biggest hobby, computers, in more depth. Or I could go to a smaller public/private school where only a certain handful of students get in each year and have to be selected on a lottery.\n\nI was leaning towards the tech school but decided to put my name in the lottery for the other school to see if I get in or not.\n\nAround June of 2017, I get a call from the Public/Private school. I got in. But they need to hear back within 2 weeks or my spot gets given to someone else. The man introduced himself as “Mike.” The Vice Principal. \n\nA week later after pressure from my mom, I accepted the offer. \n\nI setup an interview with “Mike.” \n\nFast forward a few years to my Junior Year, The Covid-19 Pandemic hit. I’m sure you know the full story about what happened that faithful March day in 2020. But I’ll save that story for now.\n\nBasically during the rest of that year, all of the teachers basically gave free passes to everyone for obvious reasons, as most students didn’t even show up to the zoom meetings.\n\nOn One of the last Full School Zoom meetings  of the Year, Both Mike and the Principal “Mary” announced they were both leaving. Mike stated it was due to a career change. Keep that in mind for later.\n\nI was devastated. Mike was one of the few administrators there that treated me like I was human. I wanted to keep in touch with him as best I could, but unfortunately Mike basically disappeared from everyone he knew at the school. \n\nIt’s now December 2020. I was depressed. I was angry. I felt like the rest of my Childhood was thrown away in an instant.\n\nI decided to reactivate my old snapchat account to see if anyone was still on there. I posted a photo. It was Mikes Yearbook Photo. The Caption “I miss you man, why did you leave.” \n\nAbout an hour later. My snapchat notifications went off. It was Allen. He said, “Dude, no fucking way.” I was confused, so I wrote back “Huh?” Allen: “Dude that’s my new principal. Mike (Lastname), right?” \n\nI was shocked. I hadn’t seen Allen since 2018 and talked to him since early 2020. And now he was claiming my former Vice Principal was his Principal. I sarcastically called “Bullshit” and asked Allen to send proof. Allen said he would at lunch/prayer time, as that’s when Mike or the principal addresses the school. \n\nAbout 2 hours later, as i’m about to drive home. A snapchat notification appeared again. It was a timed photo, but I could save it. It was a picture, It was him and Allen throwing piece signs. I quickly saved it. \n\nI then posted the conversation and the photo to the schools snapchat story. And it blew up. People were going crazy over this utterly bizarre coincidence. But it only got more bizarre from there.\n\nAround March time, Majority of the students who did zoom meetings were forced to come back to school or lose their spot in the school. When I returned people were asking me how I knew Allen. I kind of became an overnight sensation at my school. I explained everything and how crazy this whole thing was. But oh boy were we all in for a shock. \n\nA couple days after everyone came back. We were all sitting in the lunchroom when all of a sudden, Mike came into the lunch room. Or so we thought. The man had an uncanny resemblance, wore the same clothes as him and looked exactly the same facially. I dipped out of the lunch room to call Allen to see if he knew anything about why Mike was back at my school. \n\nAllen facetimed me almost immediately. “Bro, what are you talking about?” Me: “Mike, your principal formerly my principal, is back at my school.” I then pointed the camera at the guy. Allen then proceeds to point his camera. \n\nIt was Mike. Standing on the stage. Giving his daily lecture at Allen’s school. \n\nAllen thought I was bullshitting him. And so for proof I asked one of my friends sitting in the lunch room to send me a video of the guy. He was talking to the students. But didn’t seem to understand why everyone thought he was “Mike.” His name was (Terry Lastname). \n\nThe man then proceeded to buy his food at the cafeteria and got in his car and was out of there faster than you could imagine. I assumed the underclassmen harassed him beyond belief because most of them were assholes. \n\nMajority of those videos ended up on the schools Snapchat Story. With all the evidence pointing to a possible Doppelgänger. \n\nAnd we never saw that Doppelgänger again after that but I later found out that the Doppelgänger was a Part-time traveling College Math Professor. And that he worked in numerous schools and colleges around the Region. \n\nThis event still perplexes me and haunts me to this day. Wondering if it’s possible anyone could have an exact lookalike out there in the wild. We’ve seen it so many times shown on the internet. with people posting photos of them running into their “Long Lost Twin.” Or someone who looks exactly like them. \n\nI still talk to Allen, and every now and again he sends a selfie of Him and Mike to prove I’m not crazy. Allen is an amazing friend tbh. \n\nThis very event lives in my head, even as a 19 year old.",

        "author": "NeonAragorn",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10nq4sf/a_letter_passed_down_in_my_family_about_a/",
        "text": "  \n\nThis text is translated from Hindi (Devanagari) to English. \n\nThe letter was found on 12th January 1965 by a rescue party tucked inside the bark of a tree.\n\nMy love Shanti\n\nThis might be the last time I am speak directly to you. The past few days have been very difficult for me. Ever since I left home there had been this feeling of dread in the air. I know you told me to not take the mountain pass I still decided to take it as I want to reach Kamala soon. I know you believe that the retracted (Family name) put a curse on her unborn child, but I still think I am partially responsible for letting it happen and not going to our deo (devta or local god) soon enough as we all know he could have saved the child. I wanted to rush but I should’ve listened to you.\n\nThe second sunset after my departure I was resting under a deodar tree, I had crossed the Khagna pass and was trying to reach Godhna. That was when the snow came down and it snowed so much that my knees were in the snow in a few hours. I decided to set up my Pandal (tent) there only. You know this area has brags (leopards) and I wanted to avoid them. I wanted to go and empty my bladder so I found a tree far away from my pandal but I should have been more careful because I noticed later the next morning that the tree was marked by a forest deity.\n\nThat night when I slept I dreamt of you and Kamala, back when she was young. You both were playing and I approached you but the weird thing about this was I wasn’t in my body. I was behind a tree observing me approach you and kamala, almost like I was stalking us. Such a Weird thing to write, “I’ was stalking “us’’.\n\nI woke up the next noon very late which Is strange as even you know that I have always naturally woken up in the early hours of the day no matter how tired I am and how late I sleep. As I got up I noticed that there were footsteps of a foot without any boots on the surface of the snow. It seemed like whoever made those footsteps walked on the snow as if walking on water. His feet did not sink in the snow unlike me, and the snow reached up to my thighs at points. I decided to not go further on this route as you know how remote the parts after Josh are. I decided to go back and around the mountain where the paths are laid. There was one more thing I noticed. The air smelled like a Khadu was nearby, but such animals never are in places like these. I reasoned to myself that there must be a khet (farm) nearby but I couldn’t have missed it since this area is all forest and my pandal was almost near the pass. I started walking back when I noticed my mistake and started praying to the deo as I could now see what was happening with me.\n\nThe forest deity whose tree I spoiled was a Bansheera. As I started walking back not even one kilometre had passed and I heard the cowbells of a khadu dingle in the distance behind me. This was a very malicious sign and I picked up my pace but now the snow had started falling again and it was becoming darker and more difficult to see because some mist had formed around me. I do not know how long I tried to walk away from the cowbells but it never went away. I must have walked for hours as I was very tired and getting cold and dizzy but never did I stop praying and asking the deo for guidance. At some point I sat down due to exhaustion and the cowbells stopped jingling behind me but the smell did not go away. I think because of the exhaustion I forgot to pray and I heard Kamala’s voice in the distance. She was calling me, begging me to turn back but I did not turn or reply because the elders always used to say “When the Bansheera calls, do not turn back or reply. If you do, you’ll have to fight as there is no flight.”\n\nIt was there, talking to me in Kamala’s voice for hours. Soon it became night, but it never stopped talking to me. It told me stories about our time together, about Kamala’s childhood and gossip about her sasural (husband’s home) as if it knew everything. It laughed and cried but never did its voice show any emotions. I was getting more exhausted when suddenly the voice stopped and even the smell went away. I thought my prayers had been answered and the bansheera had gone away. I started to drift into sleep when I heard your voice. The foul spirit imitated you as if you were in those woods searching for me and before I could realise what was happening I jolted upright and turned towards the sound. The first thing to hit me was the smell. A khadu doesn’t smell that bad all things considered but this was like smelling a hundred khadus together in an enclosed space. Then I saw me, it was me whatever it was sitting in the same position as me some 50 meters away. \n\nAfter this happened it retreated away into the forest. And so did the mist and the snowfall. Even though it had been snowing for hours at this point the snow hadn’t accumulated on top of the existing one. It was as if the fallen snow had also vanished. After all of this came the question of where the Bansheera had gone but by this time my fate had already been decided. They say that a bansheera has the power of a dozen khadu’s but even a strong man like me cannot take so many at once.\n\nI think it gave me the night to prepare and rest as it only reappeared in the morning. I woke up and had the last food left with me to look up and see the other me sitting in the exact same position like me some 50 meters away. That is when I started writing this letter and I have noticed that everytime I look up it comes nearer and nearer. I think it will be right next to me this time as it was only 5 meters away from me the last time. I can only live if the deo decides to come and save me or give me super strength.\n\nI just want to say that I love you with every part of me, and I love kamala equally and tell her that I am sorry. I am also sorry that I did not get to take you to Shimla. I know it was your dream. There is a wad of cash near the wheat barrel. Take it and go if I do not come back. I was saving it for that purpose specifically. It’s enough for one. Pray to the Deo for my soul.\n\nYour loving husband \n\nNirmal",

        "text": "The cabin in the woods had been abandoned for years, but one night, a candle burned in the window. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy family moved out in the middle of nowhere as rent prices were too high to stay in town. We ended up in the middle of the woods in Redding California. The suburban my mother drove pulled into a parsonage on the edge of town, kicking dirt from the road as it came. An old church sat in the same driveway and beside the street there was nothing but gravel, trees, and the I-5 freeway. My brother and I piled out of the cab, stretching our legs in the driveway. The youngest of us, fussed in a car seat from the long drive. My Mother pulled the baby out and held him to calm him down. His name was Todd but every one called him bear on account of the teddy he never went without. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe all stood outside of the dingy, yellow painted house. Its wood was rickety and the shingles on the roof had began to curl yet none of us seemed to mind. A bad marriage and a worse divorce had my mom call in a favor with a friend of hers out of town. Next thing we knew we piled into Redding California being told. “Don t worry, you’ll see your dad in a month or two when we got it all worked out.” Chris and I, being 11 and 14 didn’t have much to say. We just looked at the rickety shack and hoped there was a place to plug in our games. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Julian. You and Chris get the stuff in the house while I feed the bear. Then I’ll get us some burgers from the shop up the road, sound good?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI nodded and Chris helped with only a little complaining. Truth be told we both were tired from the drive and were having none of it. The last fight we got into had our mom wind up in an emotional breakdown and neither of us wanted to see that again. So we did as were told and started falling in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe inside had the basics. A dusty carpet, working plugs. Water that tasted like it came from a hose. Apparently the preacher who lived in here before us was involved in some kind of scandal. We didn’t know much but My moms friend was a member of the church and they needed someone to keep an eye on the place. We needed a place to stay so it was a match made in heaven. I remember the place smelled of moth balls and the faintest scent of a dog now long gone. I was allergic as The smell made mz eyes itch, but I always wanted one so I never said a word about it. The Living room was sectioned off with a wall. The back half held a fireplace with an extra bathroom by the glass back door. That's where Chris and I would stay. Mom would have the room in the back with the toddler In a crib. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeeks went on as we unpacked. My parent had a job doing online counseling and tutored on the side in her room. Id babysit the bear while she worked and wed go to church on Sundays at least out of obligation. The people who ran it were in their ‘‘Golden‘‘ years. They made the occasional snide comment about my mother being unmarried. Most of it went right over our heads however and my mom grinned and bore it stoically. After all it was this or back to Boise. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was the beginning of June so school wasn't an issue. We spent our days watching TV and swinging acorns at each other from tubes of PVC. Everything was fine, until I saw Chris looking out the window after sundown. He’d sit in his bed, propped against the window and stare into the night. Time went on but the habit stayed. One day I finally put down the lingerie catalog I stole from the mall and asked him what he was doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“We’re the only ones out here right? Chris asked not so much as looking in my direction. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Except for the Cars on the road , yeah.” I wondered what it was he was getting at until he pointed outside .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You see that?” He asked me as I peered over his shoulder and sure enough I did. Way out in the woods behind out house there was the tiniest flicker of light. It was out in the hills where to our knowledge it was nothing but trees and Shasta Lake on the other side. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“It doesn’t happen every day.” Chris explained scooting over to give me room to see. “At least once a week the light comes on and all the birds in the woods go quiet.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“They do not.” This wasn't the first time he tried to scare me with nonsense but the look on his face told me he was nothing but serious. No giggle, no poorly hidden smirk. Only the look of curiosity, and a little fear. After replying in disbelief I peered into the darkness and tried to look again. The light flashed with a Rhythmic pattern. It would go on, and off again, over and over. It was the strangest thing ever. Something told me there was more to it than that yet I was more concerned with what Chris told me a second ago. I went to the kitchen, bagged one of our bins of trash and headed outside to the dumpster. Tossing it in with a clang I listened and sure enough he was right. The woods were always alive with the howl of coyotes, chirp of birds. It even had the occasional screech of an opossum. Our mother warned us about it as on the road here from Idaho but there it was. Not a sound save the drone of vehicles bounding down the freeway, nothing else but silence in between. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI came inside and told Chris not to worry about it. He went back to his video game and I to my ill gotten gains but the women in lace weren't as fun to stare at. Something bugged me about the flicker. Three flickers, three long strips of black and three again . Over and over in their pattern. I tried to keep it out of my mind but the feeling of something wrong stayed with me even as I went to sleep. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next morning I tried not to think about it. My mom went on feeding baby carrots to the baby who was now very proud of himself for being able to hold one. Chris was trying to set up the TV to watch Saturday morning cartoons and I was putting the dishes in the wash to soak. I was going to join him but I never knew a thing when it came to electronics. I reached in the boxes In my room and grabbed an old Louisville slugger I got from my dad. A few baseballs followed and I was off to go outside and practice my swing. If I got lucky and practiced, I heard I could join the JV team when school started. The backyard was short for being in the wilderness as the woods behind it were drowned in poison oak. The only other option was to go in the front yard and try not to hit the church. Facing the mountains I got into my rhythm. I tossed the ball in the air with a swing of my bat and heard the crack as it sailed across the sky. It was poetry in motion as something about the process just put my brain at ease. Staring into the woods as that itch grew in the back of my mind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Crack!” Another ball whistled through the air. I wondered why it bothered me so much, staring into the distance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Crack!”  This one leered left field and I thought it was because the pattern seemed so unnatural. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Crack” I overcompensated and it headed right. I reached in the box to grab another. It was almost as If the flickers were trying to tell me something. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was trying to tell me something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA wave of pins and needles ran through me as I came to the realization. I ran into my room so fast I banged into the glass door. Rubbing my nose and swearing to myself, I pulled it open with a heavy creak and tore into my remaining boxes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother yelled across the house bouncing bear to keep him calm. “You alright?” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I’m okay!” I didn’t even look up from my boxes. Old Robot toys and Little league trophies flew across the room as Chris walked in looking at me like I was nuts. It was then I found it. A JROTC Manual a church camp gave me when I was young. This was just post 9/11 at the time and the army was more pushy when it came to marketing to kids. I flipped through the survival tips and call signs till I got what I was looking for. A chart explaining Morse code showed every letter in a series of dots and dashes. Sure enough I was right. Three dots , Three Lines, Three Dots...SOS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI showed it to Chris and he turned pale. He adjusted the glasses too big for his head, reading it over and over trying to prove me wrong. Try as he might there was no getting around it. That flicker was a call for help. Mom would never take us but we never wanted her to be in danger either. We didn’t think to call the cops and as a couple of stupid kids thought we were going to save the day. Ill never forgive myself for what happened next.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNightfall came and the flicker made its call. The two of us came with our flannel shirts and tools in hand. I brought my baseball bat and Chris had his flashlight. Standing in the treeline I pulled out my compass and checked our direction. The light was due east so as long as we followed suit, heading west when it was over we’d make it back okay. I explained this to Chris who nodded with a smirk. “As long as we don’t end up Coyote food.” we giggled at his joke and off we went, eager for adventure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember the trees were different in the night sky. They weren't the white Aspen trees we were used to seeing in the cold but the twisted red of manzanita. Gnarled branches of reaching oak hung above and I couldn’t help but feel like the woods were closing their hands around us. Chris was brave beyond his years and he marched forward with a grim determination. Truth be told I was more scared than he was yet that signal was a call for help, and we had to go and save them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe hiked along those trees for what felt like an hour. Chris shone his light at my compass and working together we stayed in the right direction. Roots from the trees made us stumble yet no one really got hurt then except a few scrapes and a bruise along my shin. We stopped to marvel at the lack of animal life and how loud the sound of our trek had been. Every crushed leaf and branch echoed in those woods as we climbed ever higher up the hills. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen our legs tired and bodies sore we saw it in the distance. The flicker and shine of a light. I grabbed Chris and made him cut the flashlight and we crept low towards the source. The woods had made a clearing and at the center on a small ridge was an old shack. I learned later it was an outpost for the surveyors who long since found a better place to work. The panels and boards that made the thing were splintered. It Rotted even to the point of crumbling to powder at the ends. I most remember it smelled of urine and a biting coppery scent as we drew near. Looking closer at it we found what we came for. A candle lantern glowed in a filthy window and a lone hand waved between them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFear gripped us both yet we swallowed It down and pressed on. The iron door handle glimmered like ink in the moonlight. Chris stood behind me while I held the door with my free hand gripping the bat. Swallowing hard, I turned the handle and rammed my shoulder in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe lantern glowed in the darkened hovel and in its corner there was a girl. She couldn’t have been much older than us at the time. Her scared in the dark with shoulder length hair so blonde it was almost white, and freckles on a face in terror. She hid in the corner with her arms shielding her face as a pathetic cry escaped her. Her bare legs curled as she cowered In the corner wearing a one piece bathing suit with a chain around her neck. The irons were bolted to the wall in a set up that looked new compared to the rest of the place. The hand protecting her wore a band from a water park and her face wore a mix of bruises and fear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Please… don’t hurt me anymore.” She sobbed as we stood in the doorway. Our silhouette making us look like monsters. Her plea for mercy snapped us out of our shock and we immediately came to help. Chris removed his Flannel while I looked around the house for a key. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hey, we saw your signal. Its okay, were here to help.” Chris consoled her while I checked around the table and chair for a key. The place had all the signs of a regular stay. Beer bottles, canned chicken and jerky. A mattress lay in the corner and a handful of small glass pipes and empty baggies. A bucket and a bag of dog food were left by the girl, a clear sign of her conditions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Ask her where the key is.” I whispered low across the room looking around the counters left by the original owners. She pointed to the top of a tool closet used as a coat rack. Sure enough as I reached my hand above I felt the cold metal keys in my grasp. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hopped down and we set her free. The rash and cuts around her neck must have burned but she choked a sigh of relief. She shivered in the cold, rubbing the wounds where the choke chain had been.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“How'd you get the lantern tied up like this?” I asked her as she got her bearings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“He said if I was quiet I could have the light.” her chest heaved with the panic attack brewing at the thought of her captor as she started to cry. “He hurt me.” She sobbed holding Chris’ shirt as a gift of decency to her chest, warding off the memories and trauma.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sight made us want to cry as well but we held it together and got her to her feet. As we stood up we heard a rumbling from an old engine. Headlights shone across the night. A car door slammed and a man came running from a pick up truck that looked as ancient and beat up as the house. He stood in the door way cornering the three of us. A towering figure, obese with a second chin wriggling as he spoke. He wore a grease stained wife beater that stunk with malt liquor and filth. The stains off colored pooled around his neck and pits. A pair of jeans covered in food with a large belt buckle that peeked beneath the weight of his hanging stomach. His arms were yoked and the hair that crawled from the sides of his balding head to his mustache was a slick oily black. His breath was hot and stunk as he swore at us demanding. “Where do you think your going with that.” His disgusting hand pointing a round, fat finger at the girl.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI couldn’t say a word. I did the one thing that the synapse in my mind allowed and I threw my baseball bat as hard as I could. It spun through the room and hit his skull with a crack. He stumbled back enraged as I grabbed a lone chair in room, smashing it against the window. Chris and I grabbed the girl, tossing her through the hole. She landed in the broken glass and dirt with a thud yet adrenaline had kept her going. I hopped over next with Chris behind me. I was going to turn and catch him to help him land. The fall down ridge was a ten foot drop. His hands gripped the windowsill and as I looked up his head and chest were free. His eyes went wide and I heard him scream as he disappeared, pulled back into the darkness. I heard the man roaring over him as the crack of my baseball bat cut my brothers screams short. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd again...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd again… Until a sound like a watermelon popped with a final swing.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI screamed. I screamed until my throat tore and tears ran down my eyes. It was that girl who pulled me to my feet and we ran. Coward that I am we ran, leaving my poor brother far behind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe moon did little to light our way but we tore through bush and tree alike. The man chased after us enraged, still holding the bat wet with my brothers blood. Branches cut through our shirts. Blood trickled down the scrapes from our limbs as that girl and I retreated. Winding trails were no longer a question. The only way for us was down. Down and away from that monster who smelled of cheap booze. His voice roaring over two terrified children in the dark. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI pulled the girl up as she fell and she did the same for me. Our tiny bodies saving us from much of the climbing around the thicket our pursuer had to deal with to follow. Its the only reason I’m still alive. On and on we went until finally we made it through. My knees hit the dirt road with girl right behind me. I didn’t know what would happen next but the faintest voice in the back of my mind said\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n “Go home. Go Home.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I did. I grabbed The girl by my brothers shirt, pulling at her to follow. We ran on the rocks that cut our feet but we didn’t care. What we’d do to when we got home I’ve no idea but we would make it there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was then we saw police cars. The Red and blue beacons of safety as we collapsed in my yard and cried. My mother ran out to us calling out for Chris. Where is my brother she asked. And all I could do is sob, telling her I let him die. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe girls name was Allison. She went into a bathroom at a water park in Redding where the monster waited with a rag full chloroform. It was a light day for the park so the minutes it took for her to suffocate were free of prizing eyes for him to work. Nobody raised an eye when an assumed father carried a sleeping girl to his truck outside. She was meant to be sold from that place and never seen again, the fifth missing girl in a month. The police went on the lookout. They found my brothers body which had a closed casket burial, paid for by the church. We moved out from there a week later as I couldn’t sleep anymore and when I did I woke up screaming. After a few months living in a friends’ living room it was close to a happy ending. Allison grew up and left for Oregon and unfortunately I'm still here, working at a gas station night shift. Now and again ill come to smoke at my brothers grave. I tell him how I'm sorry it wasn't me who died instead. Bear grew up and joined track and field and a baseball was never seen in my house again. I got a job out here and life moved on but sometimes I look out my window knowing they never found him. Even worse I’ll peer into the dark of the mountain woods and I swear ill see that candle, flickering in the dark.",

        "text": "Today i woke up in the woods and i don’t know how i got here…\n\nToday i woke up in the woods, i don’t know how i got here or where i am. \n\nThe last thing i remember before going to sleep was that i was reading about a fictional creature..What was it? I think it was a skinwalker? A skinwalker. yeah that’s what it was.\n\nSomething is out here with me i can hear it shuffling deeper in the woods, i fear for what might be out there\n\nI found something under the leaves where i woke up..its a journal let me read it for you:\n\nSeptember 2nd, 2018 (7:35am)\n\nI seem to have woken up in the middle of the woods and i don’t know how i got here. I wonder where here is? The last thing i remember is going to sleep.\n\nI think the first thing i need to do is find some food, water and shelter before the sun goes down. The forest surrounding me is quiet as the sun is rising and the world is waking up. I start to travel downhill, i find a pond after walking for maybe 10 minutes. It appears to have fish, i only have a small pocket knife and a lighter so maybe later i can catch them and cook them. My main goal right now is shelter. I continue walking until i find a rocky overhand with foliage covering, this will work for now. I will work on gathering some sticks and logs to make a better shelter, i will write later.\n\nSeptember 2nd, 2018 (6:30pm)\n\nI built some walls from small logs and sticks i found laying around. Now i want to focus on building a fire to cook some fish and settle down for the night as the sun is now setting. I make a circle and fill it with small sticks and some dry grass, i use my lighter and get a fire going. I now go and spear a few fish with my pocket knife. I skin them and roast them over the fire, it is night now i will keep the fire going while i sleep so i can stay warm. I will write in the morning.\n\nSeptember 3rd, 2018 (7:25pm)\n\nIt is the next morning, i hear things rustling in the woods behind me, i peak out to find a few rabbits playing around in the leaves. I decide to sneak up on them and spear one with my pocket knife. I skinned the rabbit and gutted it just like my father had taught me. I roasted it over the fire and ate it before settling in before going to sleep. Good night\n\nSeptember 4th 2018 (11:25am)\n\nI haven’t been able to sleep well the past 2 nights as it seems the creature only shows up after midnight. I think i will start hunting at sunrise, eat and sleep during the day so i am awake when it comes back. I will put out the fire before settling in so it doesn’t attract the creature.\n\nSeptember 5th 2018 (1:23am)\n\nI’ve been looking for any signs of life since my last writing and i can’t seem to find anything, i walked back to where i woke up and didn’t see anything. I heard the creature trying to get me to come deeper in the woods but i didn’t listen to it. I ran back to my shelter and tried to stay calm, i don’t hear it walking around anymore hopefully it went back to its home.\n\nSeptember 6th 2018 (6:30am)\n\nToday is the day, i spent last night making spears out of rocks and longer sticks, it is time for my long dangerous journey, i need to leave this journal here just in case this ever happens to someone else. \n\nGood Bye \n\nNot exactly what i was expecting to read but i think i will follow what the writer did and try to find the shelter and the pond.\n\nAfter walking for about 10 minutes i found the shelter and the pond. In the shelter was a lot of firewood, and the pocket knife the writer had in their pocket. \n\nAfter walking around in the woods for a while i realized the writer was wrong about the creature, it walked around in the day time too but only in the shady parts of the woods. I think it is scared of the light of day, so my best decision would be to make a run for the city in the daylight but it is still very dangerous. \n\nIt’s sunset now and i’ve carved a few spears, i am sitting here trying not to fall asleep because who knows what could happen if i drift off into sleep?\n\nI made it through the first night as i saw the light of the sun start to shine through the trees. I think i will leave the journal where i woke up just in case.\n\nSpear in hand i left the journal where i woke up and started to head south, i had a feeling this was going to be a long walk. \n\nAfter about 2 hours of walking, nothing has happened. I can see a hill in front of me and the horizon just above it. \n\nThe hill was a little bit steeper than it looked but i managed to scale it. I can see the city now, i hope there is someone there that can help me. The sun is directly above me and it is a little too hot for my liking i am drenched in sweat. I sure hope i can make it to the city before nightfall. \n\nIt’s about 6:00pm i think and i have a small issue, it seems as the creature is waiting for me. It has been following me in the shady parts of the woods since i left this morning. Now i have to make it to the city before nightfall. \n\nI started to run and i can see the city clearer now, Unlucky me the sun is setting and the creature is about 700 feet in front of me.\n\nThe creature charged at me but it missed me and i started running faster, it tripped but got back up and charged at me again. It’s antlers stabbed me in 4 different places and i was bleeding but i kept running. As soon as i reached the city the creature stopped, i think it might be confined to the woods. \n\nI knocked on the first door i saw and collapsed into the arms of the man who opened the door. \n\nHe looked at me with fear and worry but mostly worry. No questions asked, she drove me to the hospital. i was safe at last, i am never going into the woods again\n\nEVER.\n\n\\--  \nKailey Moore📷**ReplyForward**",

        "text": "It was 15th October 2019, my parents said goodbye to me as they were going out for a few hours. I was left home alone. They said they'd be back by 9 so I was in charge of dinner. It was about 7:30 when I stopped playing video games and realized that I had to make some dinner. I ended up having a microwaved curry. I heard the microwave hum as it was microwaving the curry. The hums cleared my mind. I was concentrating purely on the microwave. I zoned back in after hearing a sound that did not come from the microwave. It was a loud bang sound, as if something or someone had crashed into the front door. I crept to the door and opened it, shaking with fear. I saw nothing at first, just the emptiness of the night. Somewhere in the back, however, was a dark figure standing there. It looked like it had some sort of mask on, like a smile of some sorts. I went to take a photo of it but when I lifted my phone and looked at the camera, it wasn't there anymore. My heart sank as the figure that was once there was no more. I thought to myself that it was just my mind playing tricks on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lived in an area where the neighbors weren't the easiest to get to, so I called them up and told them if they see anyone wearing a smile mask that they should call someone immediately. I didn't tell them why, I only told them it were on the news that night. I heard my microwave beep at last. I remember only putting the curry in for 5 minutes, but the clock read 8:00pm. Somehow, time managed to skip 30 seconds. I thought that was strange but carried on to eat my curry. I looked out the window for a split second and saw it again. I saw the same figure with the same smile. I called the police where they sent two officers down. They inspected the yard but found nobody. They said that the figure must have ran away, and told me to call if I saw it again. I went back out to where I saw the figure standing in the yard after the officers went but found nothing just as they did. I shrugged it off but kept on the lookout. I had the police on speed dial as I would like to call the police when I saw it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2:24 am the clock read, I was still home alone. I kept calling mother but she never answered, nor did father. I saw the face in the window behind me when I was looking in the mirror questioning what has happened to reality. I once again called the police but did not tell them that my family hadn't come home yet. The police found the very mask I was seeing and a patch of blood but no person. They couldn't find a match for the blood or any DNA matches for the fingerprints on the mask. To this very day, I have never seen the face again and the police have never found anyone matching the DNA. I still have nightmares about this.",

They snoozed soundly, faces placid and worry-free.\n\n“That.”\n\n“She has to have a family, right? I mean, you don’t really think… She couldn’t be…”\n\n“Mr. Pip’s daughter?” \n\nJake frowned as the words slipped from his mouth.  \n\n“She can’t be,” he said, “you saw that thing. There’s no way it’d be capable of making something so. So.”\n\n“Adorable?”\n\n“Exactly.” \n\nWe glanced at the little girl whose blonde curls bounced ever so slightly with each shallow breath. My heart swelled. Those two looked like they’d be content to spend the rest of their lives curled up together napping on my mattress. Jake stuck out his bottom lip.\n\n“Stop that. This is exactly why we need to figure out what to do with her. We need to find her parents. We can’t let ourselves get too attached.”\n\n“You’re right, man. They’re just so stinkin’ cute together.”\n\n“Yeah, well, pull out your phone and start looking through missing persons articles. We can’t put her in any more danger by letting her stick around.”\n\nJake nodded and dejectedly retrieved his phone from my desk. I began scouring the internet, searching for any trace of the girl. \n\n“Found it. Annie Rodgers. She went missing two years ago. It’s got a home address listed for her parents. We can drop her off at her house later tonight. No hassle, and no questions from the cops,” I said, spinning my monitor so Jake could see.\n\n“Sounds like a plan. How are we going to break the news to them?”\n\nSidney yawned, stretching her arms above her head. \n\n“What news?”\n\nJake and I shot each other a glance.\n\n“You wanna tell her?” he implored.\n\n“So, um, we found Annie’s parents. We’re taking her home tonight.”\n\n“That’s awesome! When were you planning on telling me?” \n\nIt took all my effort to hide my shock at how well she took it.\n\n“We just figured it out. We’re leaving soon.”\n\n“That went better than expected,” Jake murmured.\n\n“Yeah, you’re telling me.”\n\nSidney lightly shook Annie’s arm until she groggily opened her eyes. She rubbed away the sleep with tiny little fists. \n\n“We’re going to be taking you home now, sweetie. Would you like that?”\n\nAnnie shook her head up and down vigorously. \n\n“I miss my mommy.”\n\n“Good! You’re going to get to see her real soon. Are you ready?”\n\n“Yes!” she screamed, jumping to her feet and racing to put her shoes on.\n\n“What are you two waiting for? An invitation? Let’s go.”\n\nI punched the address into Google Maps and off we went. I slowly pulled my car to the curb on the opposite side of the street a few houses down and killed the lights. \n\n“Annie, do you see that house right there?” I asked, pointing to a dimly lit home, illuminated by the faint glow of a streetlamp.\n\nShe nodded.\n\n“That’s your house. Ring the doorbell and your parents will be there.”\n\nShe smiled feverishly and reached for the door handle.\n\n“Sweetheart, before you go, I need you to make me a promise,” Sidney requested sternly.\n\nAnnie looked at her. She cocked her head to the side and furrowed her brow, bright blue eyes full of confusion. \n\n“They’re going to ask you a lot of questions. Whatever you do, promise me that you won’t tell *anyone* about us, okay? Not even your parents.”\n\n“Why?” \n\n“Because bad people will hurt us if you do. Do you promise?”\n\nShe paused for a moment, deep in thought.\n\n“Yes, I promise.”\n\n“Good, now hurry along. Your parents are waiting.”\n\nShe hopped out of the car and began to trot toward her house. She turned back a few feet from us.\n\n“Thank you for saving me.”\n\nAll we could do was smile. We watched as Annie ran to her doorstep and rang the bell. Just as I was wondering if anyone would answer, a man hesitantly pulled open the door. His face lit up and he scooped his daughter into his arms, tears streaming down his face. A woman soon joined the pair and wept with joy, embracing the little girl. I glanced in the rearview mirror. A single tear rolled down Sidney’s cheek. \n\n“Drive.”\n\nExhausted and emotionally drained, we decided to call it a night. We made it back to my house without incident and we were off in dreamland in no time. I let Sidney sleep in my bed, while I took the couch. \n\nSunlight beamed into my eyelids, forcing me out of a fitful slumber. I groggily rolled over and tapped my phone screen to check the time. 7:32 A.M. \n\n“Good freaking morning, I guess.”\n\nI rose and slunk to the kitchen, preparing a bowl of Frosted Flakes, and lazily trudged back to the living room. I began researching the next victim of my writing. Charlene Adkins. She’d died in a car accident but returned home after her husband had wished her back with a cursed monkey paw. I found her obituary relatively effortlessly. It listed a home address to send gifts and condolences to her husband. All that was left to do was wait for the others to wake up.\n\nJake emerged from his room about an hour later. He yawned, wearily rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. \n\n“How’d you sleep lil bro? I bet that was comfortable.”\n\n“Yeah, you got that right. My back is killing me. We have got to invest in a new couch. This thing is stiffer than a wood plank.” \n\n“I think the neighbors just threw one out last week. I hear the junk yard has a pretty good selection these days.”\n\n“Ha. Ha. Very funny. By the way, I found Charlene and Martin’s address. We can head out whenever Sidney gets up.”\n\n“Who’s address?” Sidney asked, catching me off guard. \n\nShe was already fully dressed and prepared to tackle the day. Her hair was done and she’d even put on some eyeliner.\n\n“Don’t do that! You scared the shit out of me.” \n\n“What was I supposed to do? Announce my presence like the Queen of England? Here ye, here ye! The amazing Sidney White will now enter the living room!”\n\nJake and I chuckled. \n\n“Fair point. Give us a few minutes to get ready. We’ll fill you in on the way.”\n\nWe piled into my car as I plugged the address from the obituary into my phone. I drove, while Jake explained the situation to Sidney. After a short five minute drive, we arrived at our destination. We again found ourselves in a middle-class suburban neighborhood. \n\n“So… we’re just going to knock on their door out of the blue and introduce ourselves?” Sidney asked.\n\n“Yeah. Do you have a better idea? There wasn’t a phone number or any other contact info listed,” Jake retorted. \n\n“Well, no.”\n\n“Alright then, let’s do this.”\n\nWe hopped out of the car and approached the door. I rang the bell and we waited. And waited. I was preparing to leave, when the door creaked open slightly. An eyeball appeared in the crack. \n\n“Whatever you’re selling, I don’t want any,” a fatigued sleep-deprived voice declared. \n\n“Wait, Mr. Adkins! We’re not here to sell you anything. We know about your wife, and we want to help,” I said, realizing how strange the three of us probably appeared to him, just showing up randomly like we had.\n\n“My wife’s dead. Now if you’ll excuse me-”\n\n“We know she’s not. You used a monkey paw to wish her back. Please, Martin, we just want to help you. Both of you.”\n\nMr. Adkins flung the door open. He’d obviously been through the wringer. His hair was disheveled and dirty. It looked like it hadn’t been washed in days, maybe even weeks. Dark purple bags drooped under his bloodshot eyes. He reeked of body odor and cheap whiskey. \n\n“H-how do you know that? I’ve never told a soul about Charlene.”\n\n“We’ll explain everything. Can we come inside?” \n\n“Yeah. Come on in.”\n\nThe house was as much of a wreck as Mr. Adkins was. Papers and books were strewn about the living room. Empty liquor bottles had been discarded haphazardly on the floor. Half-eaten take-out boxes and water bottles littered the coffee table. We stepped inside and introduced ourselves.\n\n“I’m Matt. This is my brother, Jake. And this is Sidney.”\n\nJake nodded and Sidney waved awkwardly.\n\n“Nice to meet you all. Let’s take a seat. You all owe me an explanation.”\n\nWe all squished onto a filthy liquor-stained couch. It made my skin crawl just sitting on it. We told Mr. Adkins the entire story. He listened in amazement without interrupting once. \n\n“Well, unfortunately that’s not the craziest thing I’ve experienced in the past couple of months. I wish I could say it was.”\n\n“Again, I’m sorry. I had no idea that all of this would happen, and I’m still not sure what triggered the whole thing. But in order to get your wife back to normal, we need you to tell us everything that the story left missed. Any details that stick out.”\n\nHe sighed.\n\n“Okay. It all started two months ago when Charlene got into a car wreck. She was on her way back from the grocery store when a drunk driver hit her head-on. She died instantly on impact, while that son-of-a-bitch only sustained minor injuries. He’s rotting in a jail cell for what he did to her.”\n\nI could feel the anger radiating from him upon mentioning the drunk. \n\n“Other than that, it seems like you hit the nail on the head. Charlene came back unexpectedly one night, I unknowingly made some stupid wishes on the monkey paw, and here we are. I’ve been hiding Charlene away ever since. I work remotely, so I’m able to look after her all day. The world’s leading doctors and scientists wouldn’t be able to help her in her current state. They’d just poke her and prod her and put her in more pain than she’s already in.”\n\nTears welled in his eyes. \n\n“I want to fix this so badly, but I don’t know how. I feel like I’ve failed her.”\n\n“Mr. Adkins, you definitely haven’t failed her. You did the only thing you knew to do. Do you by chance have the monkey paw lying around anywhere?” Jake asked.\n\n“Yeah. Let me go get it.”\n\nHe slipped into his bedroom and returned, holding a shriveled mummified monkey paw. \n\n“You can have this thing. It disgusts me just looking at it.”\n\nHe dropped it into Jake’s outstretched palm. The second he did so, three of its gnarled digits curled outward. We stared at it slack-jawed. \n\n“It’s your lucky day, Jake. Three wishes for you,” I grinned. \n\n“Cool! I’m gonna wish for a-”\n\n“No, you idiot. You’re not going to wish for anything yet. They come with a price, remember?” Sidney berated him. \n\n“Oh, yeah.”\n\n“Before we make any decisions, can we… see her?” I requested sternly.\n\nMr. Adkins pursed his lips. \n\n“I guess it wouldn’t hurt. She’s in here, but just be prepared for what you’re about to see. It isn’t pretty.”\n\nHe led us to their bedroom door and gradually pushed it open. We all stepped inside. The foul stench of decay immediately assaulted my nostrils. Jake gagged. Sidney darted back into the living room and vomited in a trash can. My eyes watered as the putrid odor enveloped us. Through my teary vision I saw her.\n\nCharlene sat in an armchair on the opposite end of the room. She was in bad shape. She was nothing more than skin and bones, flesh sloughing off her tiny, emaciated frame in thick patches. Most of her hair had fallen out, and what little remained clung to her head in thin wispy strands. She opened her mouth to speak, and through dry cracked lips, I could only see a handful of brown jagged teeth protruding from her gums.  \n\n“H-help me. Please.”\n\nHer deep blue eyes pleaded with me to do something. My heart shattered for her. I could sense immense pain and anguish behind her gaze. \n\n“Please,” she croaked, extending a bony hand that was missing several extremities. \n\n“We’ll be back in a minute, baby. We’re going to figure out how to help you.”\n\nMr. Adkins turned to me as he motioned to close the door.\n\n“The worst part,” he said through tears, “is that I know the woman I love is still in there. She’s still her, even though her body is failing. We need to come up with-”\n\n“I wish Charlene was never in that car accident,” Jake blurted out before I had a chance to stop him. \n\nWe stared at the monkey paw as one mangled finger slowly closed.\n\nI slugged Jake in the arm.\n\n“You moron! We needed to talk through how to fix this before just making wishes at random.”\n\n“I’m sorry. I just couldn’t bear to see her suffering like that,” he muttered, rubbing his arm.\n\n“Guys. Look,” Sidney whispered, pointing directly at Charlene. \n\nCharlene was beautiful. She looked nothing like the monstrosity we’d been gawking at moments prior. She was absolutely glowing. Her skin was youthful and radiant. Long blonde hair cascaded down her back in waves. All her digits had returned, and the rancid smell of rot had disappeared. She glanced up at us with shimmering blue eyes. Her expression suddenly twisted to one of dread.\n\n“W-who are you people, and why are you in my house?”\n\n“We were here with your husband. Right, Mr. Adkins?”\n\nI turned to him to bail us out. He was gone. Where he’d been standing just seconds earlier, now sat a dark black puddle of liquid. My heart sank into my stomach.\n\nJake fumbled with the monkey paw.\n\n“I wish to undo my last wish!”\n\nNothing.\n\n“I wish Mr. Adkins was still here.”\n\nWe were met with tense silence. \n\n“Come on, you stupid thing! Work! I wish Martin Adkins was still alive!”\n\nThe monkey paw remained motionless. \n\n“I don’t know if this is some kind of sick joke or what, but you need to leave. Martin passed away two months ago.”\n\n“We… I... it…” Jake stuttered as Charlene ushered us out the door. \n\n“Look, Charlene, we’re sorry. We know-”\n\n*Slam.*\n\nWe were left alone in the brisk morning air as Charlene abruptly shut the door in my face. \n\n“What do we do now?” Sidney whimpered.\n\n“I don’t think there’s anything else we can do. The monkey paw isn’t co-operating, and Charlene won’t believe a word we say. Let’s go home I guess.”\n\nSidney solemnly nodded as we headed for the car. Jake stared off into space, unmoving. \n\n“Jake. Jake! Earth to Jake! Hello?!” \n\nI waved a hand in front of his face. He eventually snapped out of it. \n\n“Are you okay? I thought we lost you for a second.”\n\n“Yeah,” he mumbled despondently, as he shuffled toward the car.\n\nThe drive home was a somber one. Nobody said a word until we made it back to my house. \n\nJake broke down the moment we crossed the threshold. Fat sloppy tears streamed down his face. \n\n“Matt, I don’t know if I can do this anymore. Mr. Adkins died in that car crash instead of his wife because *I* made a stupid decision.” \n\n“It’s not your fault, Jake. He would’ve wanted his wife to be happy. You ended her suffering,” I reassured him, resting a hand on his shoulder. \n\n“I know. I just. I need some time to myself.” \n\n“I understand. Please let me know if there’s anything I can do. I love you big bro.”\n\n“I will. I love you too,” he sniffled as he meandered to his room. \n\nHis languished wails were still audible through the door. I tried my best to tune it out. I turned to Sidney. \n\n“Looks like it’s just you and me now. I hope you’re in the mood for a road trip. We’ve got a rat to exterminate.”",

        "text": "It all started when my parents were gone for the week and, uh I feel really uncomfortable writing this. They left me and my 8 year old brother at the house while they were at vacation, and they trust me since I was already 14. I was kinda happy because no one would get to boss me around, and I get to be in charge over my brother. All that happiness was gone when the week ended. \n\nDay 1\nI was ready to play some video games later, so I got up early and prepared breakfast for my brother. He got up from bed saying \"Hey bro, my body it- well it itches. Every single part of my body it just itches\" \"Huh? Well maybe you can take a bath later in the afternoon so the itch can go away. Just don't bother me when I'm playing and for now let's just eat breakfast.\"\nThe day went on as usual, but my brother's itch didn't go away.\n\nDay 2\nRight the moment my brother woke up he complained about the itch. \"Ugh why won't this itch go away, I'm getting tired of it.\" I just told him to take another, more thorough bath. I felt bad for my brother because I've had a skin condition in the past and it really does itch, but I can't find a solution to his itch. Although when he was taking a bath, I noticed something on the walls, and I can't really describe it but it looks like.... Dust.\n\nDay 3\nI was thinking of taking him to my friend's mother later who was a nurse and can help us with my brother's condition. I tried to get out of the house, but no matter what I try the door just won't open. It's like it's been locked, and it seems like the windows just disappeared. I don't know what is happening and I'm starting to freak out, but all I know is that someone doesn't want us to get out of the house. \n\nDay 4\nThings have gotten worse. The dust on the wall has become so thick that it covered every part of the house. The dust was on our food, furniture and even on our water, and when I touched the skin of my brother this afternoon, and the texture- it- it just felt like the same texture of the dust stuck to our wall. Sometime in the evening when I just finished washing the plates, I saw my brother crying my taking off some of his skin. The blood started to flow freely out of his body. \"Brother, it just itches. It never stops, I can't stop scratching.\" I immediately took the knife out of his hands, this house was clearly wrong, it's disease has spread to my brother and we can't get out. \n\nDay 5\nTjings didn't go better from here in fact it just got so much worse. I woke up from an afternoon nap I knew there was something wrong. I heard loud screams upstairs, so I rushed to the 1st floor as I found my brother's skin all ripped off. His tears were rushing from his eyes, the blood stained on the floor. He kept screaming as he violently ripped off the skin from his leg. \"Stop it Greg, just stop it please! You need to stop, you are hurting yourself.\" \"I can't stop I just can't! It just itches so much! Please help me it itches!\" I didn't know what to do, I stood there until he started to rip off his hair. I saw pools of blood start coming out from the stop of his head, his eyes seemed like they were red from all his crying. \"I can't stand it anymore just kill me!\" He ran right down the stairs, headed to the kitchen and he got a knife. I followed him down there and before I could do anything he stabbed his chest. I stood there not knowing what to do next, I was helpless and useless to my brother, all I could do was cry. He kept stabbing himself while scratching until his body fell to the ground \n\nDay 6\nI slowly rise from my bed, and reality came rushing through my brain. My brother was dead, and it took me a while to notice the dust on the wall. It was so thick that you could barely see anything through it. The blood had dried up on the floor and I could still imagine him just ripping off pieces of his skin. I coughed and coughed and I just realized that I feel a bit weird..... I can't describe it, but my body....... It itches.",

        "text": "\nDon’t get drunk and break into cemeteries in New Orleans. And if you do, don’t piss on any tombs with a bunch of X marks all over it. I did that six days ago, Saturday, and I’ve died every day since. \n\nAfter leaving the cemetery that night, I stubbed my foot stepping up on to a curb and broke my neck on the wall outside a bar. I dreamed of a woman that night. She wore a white dress and stared at me. But I couldn’t have dreamed anything. Do the dead dream?\n\nSunday morning, I woke up in my bed with no hangover. I had a clear head, which was rare for me in the mornings, but the details of the night before were still hazy. I checked myself out in the mirror but didn’t see any signs of damage. I remember tripping on the curb, then the wall of the bar came rushing towards me. I was so drunk that I didn’t put out my hands to catch myself. Then blackness. \n\nPushing the thought away, I started my day. I left my apartment and walked down the block to the corner diner. Most mornings I needed coffee to chase away my hangover. No hangover that morning but the craving was still there. \n\nI sat at the counter and ordered. A tall, very dark-skinned man was sitting at the counter. He was dressed in an old fashioned dark purple suit. He had coattails and all. He stood as I sat down, said good morning, and made his way out the diner. “Be seeing yall later,” he said to the diner. Everyone ignored him.\n\nI turned and looked at him as the door was slowly swinging shut. He tipped his top hat at me as he was putting it on. His smile was yellow just like his eyes. As the door swung shut, I could see him lighting a cigar. I think he winked at me.  \n\nAfter my coffee I walked over to Jackson Square. Maybe the fortune tellers could tell me something. They all turned me away. The real ones did at least. You can tell which ones are real. After that failure, I walked back towards the river. A carriage horse got spooked by some tourists lighting firecrackers and caved the side of my head in with a kick. \n\nMonday, I woke up again in my bed. This was really happening. I searched the news but there were no stories about a horse killing anyone on Decatur St. I gave in and decided that the only thing for me was to get nice and drunk. I was sober for a whole day. That was an accomplishment for me. Well, sober for a morning at least. \n\nThat night I **tied one on**. I couldn’t get enough. At one point, I think I remember that tall guy from the diner buying me a drink. “Wuz dis?”, I asked as he handed me a double shot of something dark. “Oh, its always rum for me baby,” he answered before throwing back his shot. I didn’t care, I would have drunk anything that night. “Be seeing you around,” he said before fading into the crowd of the bar. \n\nI was shot in the back while walking home. They killed me for the $9 I had in my pockets. In my dreams that night the lady in white was sitting on a short stool with her back turned to me. I walked towards her, but she never turned around. No matter how close I got to her, no matter how far I stretched my hand to her, I couldn’t touch her. \n\nTuesday, I decided to stay in. If I don’t go outside, I can’t die I thought. My mistake was to drink a fifth of vodka and try to take a bath. I must have passed out because when I came to the water was freezing cold. I slipped getting out of the tub and bashed my head in on the rim of the toilet.\n\nI still couldn’t reach the woman in white. She was working with something in her lap. Every time I walked around to her front to see what she was doing; I would just be looking at her back again. \n\nWednesday, I believed the bed would be sanctuary. Surely nothing bad can happen to me in bed. Things were going well until I smelled the smoke and heard the sirens. The fire must have started in an apartment below me. I threw open my front door and ran for the stairs. They collapsed as I made it to the landing. Since I was on the top floor, I had nowhere to go. Resigned, I walked back inside. People were staggering out of my building onto the street below. A crowd formed across the street, and some of them were pointing up at my window. The Tall Man was standing amongst them, smiling up at me. He tipped his hat to me as my floor collapsed and I fell into the inferno below. \n\nI found out what the woman in white was working with. This time she was standing. She had a dead chicken in her hands. With a quick motion she twisted and wrenched the head from the chicken. She began chanting and moved in a circle, making a ring of blood on the ground around her. I called to her, but she ignored me. Right before I woke up, she glanced up at me, glaring into my eyes. \n\nBy Thursday I had given up. Whatever was happening to me was out of my control. My room was like it always was. No signs of a fire. As soon I got up, I went straight for Bourbon St. because the bars never close there. With an empty stomach I got to work. Even on Bourbon St. drunks aren’t tolerated very well before noon. After getting kicked out of the third bar I sat down on a curb with a Big Ass Beer. The Tall Man sat down beside me. We were quiet for a few minutes before I asked him, “Why is this happening to me?”\n\n“Now now, don’t you worry about that cher. Just a few more days and it will all be over. Now if you hurry there is a party bus carrying a bachelorette party about to cross Bourbon just a few blocks that way.” He pointed down the street. “The driver is a man a lot like you. He was out way too late last night and might not have all his faculties about him.”\n\nI nodded and stood up. The Tall Man called to me as I walked away. “Au revoir mon ami.”\n\nThe bus plowed right through the stop sign. He was right. The driver never saw me. The bus squealed to a halt too late, with me trapped underneath. I could smell my skin melting on the scalding undercarriage. The driver ran out and saw what he did. He turned away to vomit as the party rushed out of the bus to see what was happening. A pretty lady wearing a sash that read “Bride” saw me and dropped her tall, green novelty drink. The last thing I heard was the screams of her and her bridesmaids.  \n\nThe woman in white walked towards me in my dreams that night. She held a dusty bottle with no label that was full of some type of dark liquor. She stood in front of me and took a big pull from the bottle. With a look of disdain she held the bottle out to me. I reached for it but she pulled it away and spat the liquor in my face. She began chanting something in French creole and walked around me in a circle, stopping periodically to tease me by holding the bottle out in front of her. Every time I reached for the bottle she would pull it away, take another swig, and spit it back into my face. Her chanting continued in between her taunts. Finally, she stopped and stared at me with hatred. “Time to wake up fool,” she said. It wasn’t English, but I understood her. She took one long pull from the bottle, blood began to dribble from between her lips, and she spewed it back onto me.\n\nI shot up from my sleep and was horrified to find my face and chest covered in blood. I cleaned myself up and spent the rest of the day wandering aimlessly around my apartment. Eventually, I headed out and walked around the Quarter until late into the night. The Tall Man would be waiting for me in the doorway or window of a bar, always with a shot rum held out and one for himself. I just ignored him and walked on. Well after midnight, near the edge of the Quarter, I saw her waiting for me on a distant streetcorner. “Last chance mon ami,” said the Tall Man from the doorway of a quiet bar. The bar was dark because it was closing up. It was hard to make out the details of his face, but it looked like he was wearing white paint in the shape of a crude skull. I took the offered shot and drank it down slowly, savoring the burn. She rounded the corner and I followed. \n\nAs I walked, I would lose sight of her. But she would always be there when I turned a corner or a car passed by, just standing and staring at me from a distance. Eventually I found myself walking next to a tall white wall. An opening in the wall revealed a huge, ornate iron gate. I stopped at the gate, and it slowly swung open, creaking on its century’s old hinges. Of course. Back where this all began. The cemetery. My feet carried me down the boulevard of this miniature city of the dead. She was gone again so I scanned the side alleys for her. I saw a flash of her white dress between the crumbling tombs so I ventured deeper into the cemetery after her. \n\nShe was waiting for me next to a tomb. The tall man stood with her. When I stopped in front of them, he turned and removed the name plaque of one of the openings to the crypt. The stale air that issued out smelled of must and decay. He bowed low and gestured me inside. I began to weep but still I climbed inside. I turned over onto my back in the tight space and looked out. He smiled at me and said, “Its been a pleasure. Truly.”\n\nHe lifted the plaque back up and sealed me inside, covering me in sweet darkness. Finally, I could rest.",

        "text": " My fiance, (Jess) and I (Laura) have been looking for a place to call home since the start of 2021. We live on the outskirts of Germany, not too far away from the Netherlands. \n\nWe eventually did find something at the beginning of this year, 2023. It was an average 3-room apartment on the 3rd floor, with a balcony, one bathroom, and one kitchen. The apartment was located in a fairly small resident house with 3 apartments on each floor, 3 floors, totaling up to 9 apartments. \n\nWe began moving in 3 weeks ago, and during that time, no neighbors showed their faces or offered help, which was fine, but we did hope to at least meet one or two of them during the transition. \n\nWe began sorting through our stuff last week, arranging our things the way we want them to be. \n\nOne important point I forgot to mention is- since our apartment is on the top floor, it's a roof apartment, meaning most of our outside walls are tilted. \n\nWe discovered a crawl space in one of the guest rooms, it wasn't really hidden. It was inside one of the tilted walls, and it was just a small space, not big enough to crawl around in, much less walk around in, but big enough to put a couple of things away that are not needed. You can think of it as an attic. \n\n\"Hey Jess, come look at this!\" I called out to her after having discovered the space.\n\n\"What is it?\" Jess came in carrying a curious expression on her face. \n\nI pointed to the dark crawl space. \"I'll grab a flashlight.\" She said.\n\n\"Oh don't be old fashioned,\" I told her, and pulled out my phone, turning on the flash. \n\nI pointed the light into the crawl space, it still had some stuff inside, old paint buckets, and a couple of boxes. I also noticed something big and black in the far corner. It looked like a computer. \n\n\"Let me look,\" Jess said, sounding impatient. I moved out of the way and handed her my phone, she gave me a grin and poked her head in.\n\n\"Is that a computer?\" She asked after a moment. \n\n\"Yeah, I think so,\" I answered. \n\n*(For those curious, I attached a picture of the old computer and a picture of the crawlspace* [here](https://imgur.com/a/0Q9QYfX)*.)*\n\nWe played rock paper scissors to decide who would go crawl inside the crawlspace to retrieve a couple of boxes and the computer. I won, and Jess grumpily crawled in. \n\n\"There's so much dust!\" She said between coughs. I was just glad it wasn't me in there. She finally got back with the computer in tow, it was on wheels, so it helped not needing to carry it out. \n\nShe went back in and returned with one of the boxes next, and soon after the last one. \n\n\"It's just clothes in here,\" I said, somewhat disappointed, after looking through the first box.\n\n\"Same here.\" Jess responded. \"But they look kind of weird..\" \n\n\"Weird how?\" I asked her. Mine didn't look weird, not that I could tell anyway. \n\n\"Come look.\" I walked over to where jess was sitting on the ground. The box contained old clothes as Jess said, the clothes themselves looked normal, they were old jeans, t-shirts, hoodies, etc. What was weird were the stains. There were blotches of red all around them, it looked like someone had taken a bucket of red paint and just dropped it into the box. \n\n\"Is that blood?\" I asked Jess. \n\n\"I don't know, are yours like that too?\" \n\n\"No, my box has no such stains.\" I glanced over at the computer.\n\n\"Do you think it works?\" Jess was looking at it too now. \n\n\"Only one way to find out.\" \n\nWe first had to figure out what kind of cables we needed in order to turn it on, which didn't happen until the next day when my best friend Paul came over. He's working as an IT specialist, so this was kind of his thing. We didn't want to break it, in case it was still working, but we also didn't want to spend any money on any hardware that we may need without knowing that the computer worked first.\n\n\"Ooh this thing's old and dusty,\" Paul said after only taking a look. \n\n\"I'd guess it's 2008, maybe 2009?\" He was talking to himself while inspecting it. He did something because the next thing I know, something popped and he opened up the computer, taking a peek inside. \n\n\"Don't break it,\" Jess warned.\n\nPaul laughed in response. \"Are you the expert or am I?\" \n\nThey both never actually saw eye to eye, but they tried because they both loved me. \n\n\"Definitely not older than 2008.\" Paul began talking to himself again.\n\n\"But it looks like it should work, want to try turning it on?\" He turned to me awaiting an answer, I nodded. \n\n\"Alright I'll go grab some stuff I need to turn it on, and we can see what we find.\" I could tell he was excited. I was too, mostly just curious about what we'd find inside. The naive part of me hoped there'd be bitcoin on there. Not that I know how bitcoin even look, I just know bitcoin is worth a lot. And I've heard stories of people finding bitcoin on old computers.\n\nPaul returned with a monitor, a mouse and a keyboard, and a couple of other cables in hand. We plugged in the power source and turned on the computer after plugging in the rest. It buzzed for a moment and then the screen lit up.\n\n\"It works!\" We all released the breaths we were holding. \n\nIt took a while to power up, but once it did the desktop came to life, and boy was it full. There were icons of apps, folders, documents, and things I didn't even recognize. \n\nAfter clicking a couple of times Paul said, \"This thing's full of stuff, both the disks are full.\"\n\n\"But it works, so that's awesome.\" He added.\n\nJess and I both observed as Paul worked, clicking here and there, doing something. \n\n\"I can get this cleaned up for you and fully functional in a couple of days.\" He finally said, still not looking away from the screen.\n\nJess nodded. \n\n\"How about you let us see what's on it first, and then you can come to pick it up next week?\" I asked. I was being nosy. Jess gave me one of her disapproving looks. \n\nPaul looked straight at me and smiled. \"Sure can do, just don't break anything while you're at it.\" Jess shook her head. \n\nPaul left shortly after and we were left alone. My fingers were itching to pick up the mouse and keyboard and get to work, and so I did. \n\nI looked through what could be found on the desktop first. There were a couple of resumes, old documents, employment files, resignation files, etc. I had the numbers and emails and names of these people right at my disposal.\n\nNext, I took note of the various apps, trying to see if there was anything related to bitcoin, but had no such luck. \n\nAfter clicking through a couple of things I stumbled upon a folder titled \"Images.\" I clicked on it and began skimming through them. I didn't know who exactly these people were, but they looked normal. They looked like a normal family. \n\nMy attention suddenly turned to the crawlspace as I heard a shuffling sound coming from in there. The door to it was still closed. I slowly walked over, placing my ear on the door, trying to listen in. I couldn't hear anything. As soon as I began walking away I heard a shuffle again. This time I turned on the flash on my phone, opened the door, and peeked inside. I was expecting a rat or a mouse, but instead, I saw nothing. Just an empty space. I sighed a sigh of relief and closed the door, getting back to the computer.\n\nI looked through it for another maybe 5 minutes before finally losing interest.\n\nI got back to it the next day after work. I immediately noticed some changes, the way some stuff was shown on the desktop, was different. But I shrugged it off, maybe Jess snooped around too. There was a brand new folder on the desktop titled, \"CCTV\"\n\nI opened the folder and found a bunch of video files, hundreds. They all were titled with dates. The first video was titled November 5th and the last December 23rd.\n\nI clicked on the first video and a video player appeared on the screen. The video was 8 hours long, and it showed multiple perspectives of what seemed to be rooms in darkness. I finally realized that it was our apartment it was showing, but it looked different. It wasn't laid out the same way, the furniture was different too. \n\nThe bedrooms were being filmed too, there were two figures inside the king-sized bed in the main bedroom, and a single figure in the guest room, it looked like a children's room. The room I was in, the room that had the crawlspace. \n\nI skipped forward a couple of minutes and watched in horror as the crawlspace door creaked open. I could see a hand reaching out into the room. Then the figure in the bed got up and rubbed their eyes. The hand inside the crawlspace retreated into the darkness. The figure in the bed, which I realized was a young boy, was frozen in place, just staring at the open crawlspace door. I skipped forward a couple more minutes. The boy finally got out of bed and slowly walked over to the crawlspace, shutting the door. He then took one of the toy boxes in his room and pushed it to block the door. \n\nThe boy then ran back to his bed and got under the covers. I continued skipping forward and got to the morning, and then the video ended. \n\nI closed it and opened the next one, titled November 6th. This one also started at night. I watched as the mother kissed the boy goodnight and walked out of the room. The box was still in front of the crawl space. I skimmed through the video, but nothing out of the ordinary happened during this one. \n\nI opened the next one. This one was titled \"November 7th morning\" It was short, 5 minutes, and it only showed the little boys' room during day time. I watched as the presumed mother walked into his room and pushed away the box of toys, which was blocking the crawlspace's entrance. She then opened it and peeked inside, retrieving some sort of object that was out of view. She closed the crawlspace door and walked out of the room, but the video kept playing. \n\nThe door slowly opened and I saw something dark and shadowy quickly moving from one side of the crawlspace to the other. Then the video ended.\n\nI continued looking through the videos, they were much the same. At some point at the start of December, the boy stopped sleeping in his room, and instead slept in the living room, on their sofa. \n\nA hand appeared on my shoulder and I got startled. \n\n\"Woah!\" Jess said, taking a step back. \"I didn't mean to scare you, I mean, you were really in there.\" \n\nI just looked at her with a blank expression. \n\n\"It's late, come on, let's go to bed.\" \n\n\"Late? It's only 6 PM.\" I responded. \n\n\"It's 9 PM, Laura.\" \n\nDid I really spend my entire day watching those videos? I stood up from the chair and followed Jess out of the guest room. Just as I closed the door I heard something creak open inside. I opened the door again. The crawlspace door was open. \n\n\"What the fuck?\" I whispered under my breath. Jess came back over. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"The crawlspace door just opened on its own,\" I responded, still looking inside the room, looking into the darkness of the crawlspace, half expecting to see a hand or something moving. \n\nJess brushed past me and walked inside the room, and my heart dropped. I was afraid, why was I afraid? I wanted to say something, but my lips were sealed shut. She walked over to the crawlspace door and closed it. \n\n\"Problem solved.\" She shot me a grin, and I felt my tensed-up body relax just a little. \n\nI had a nightmare that night. I dreamt that I was sleeping in that room, it looked just like that little boy's room. The same furniture I had seen in the videos. I dreamt that the crawlspace door opened. I felt that I was scared, really scared. And I was frozen. But eventually, I got the courage to stand up and go and close it. I walked over to the crawlspace door and peered inside. I saw two glowing blue circles inside, and then the dream ended. \n\nI was really distracted at work the next day, my boss almost sent me home. I couldn't stop thinking about those videos. They were so bizarre, so weird. What was that thing inside the crawlspace? Was it haunted? Was it an animal?\n\nI went straight into the guest room after I got home. The crawlspace door was closed and I sighed a sigh of relief. I turned on the computer. The desktop had been changed again. There now was a second folder, this one titled \"CCTV 2\"\n\nThe first video was titled \"January 1st\", and the last \"February 7th.\"\n\nThere were a lot of missed dates in this folder, the next video that followed after January 1st, was January 7th, and then 10th, and then 12th. \n\nI opened the first video. it showed the same perspective as the CCTV footage from the old videos. Except the entire apartment was empty. No furniture. The video was 23 minutes long. I watched as the front door to the apartment opened and three figures stepped in. My whole body tensed up then. I had chills crawling all over my skin. It was Jess and I and the realtor that entered. I watched as the realtor showed us around the apartment, just like the very first day we were shown around. But I don't remember seeing any camera's around. Where is this footage coming from? \n\nWhile we were in the master bedroom, the guest's room crawlspace door opened. I could see two blue pixels inside the darkness, just like I had seen in my dream. \n\nI closed the video and opened the next one, \"January 7th\". \n\nIt was only 3 minutes long. I watched as the realtor walked inside the apartment and went straight into the guest room. He opened the door to the crawlspace and crawled inside. He crawled out at around 2:30 minutes of the video, and ran out of the apartment, leaving the crawlspace door wide open. \n\nThe next video, \"January 10th.\" Was our moving day, I watched as we moved into the apartment, carrying all our different appliances through the front door while something lurked inside the darkness of the crawlspace. At some point in the video, Jess and I were discussing something right in front of the guest room, and her hand was on the handle, already turning to open the door. The crawlspace door slowly closed by itself moments before Jess walked inside the room.\n\nI turned off the video and looked around the room. Looking for any hidden cameras. I had to tell Jess about this, I had to show her. \n\nI continued looking through the videos until I got to \"January 29th.\" That is tomorrow.\n\nIt was short, 2 minutes. It was only showing the guest room. I saw how Jess walked inside the room and opened the crawlspace. She crawled inside and out of view. Then the crawlspace door shut closed, and the video ended. I was frozen in shock. \n\nI closed the video and turned off the computer, walking out of the room. \n\n\"What's going on?\" Jess suddenly appeared before me. When did she get back home from work? I pulled out my phone to look at the time. It was 8 PM, what the fuck? When did it get so late again? It felt like I was inside that room for maybe half an hour, not longer. \n\n\"You okay?\" Jess had a worried look. \n\nI nodded in response and walked into the kitchen and poured myself a glass of water. \n\n\"I need to show you something.\" I finally said to Jess.\n\n\"oo you find something cool on that computer?\" She said excitedly, but her expression quickly changed when mine remained grim. \n\n\"What is it?\" She asked, now sounding a little worried.\n\nI motioned for her to follow me and we went to the guest room. When I opened the door, the crawlspace was open. I took a deep breath and walked inside, immediately closing the crawlspace door. \n\n\"You're scaring me.\" She said from behind me. \n\n\"Just look,\" I said while picking up the mouse. I looked on the desktop and looked for the folders titled CCTV and CCTV 2. They were gone. \n\n\"How is that possible?\" I muttered under my breath. \n\n\"What?\" Jess asked.\n\n\"The folders- the videos- they're all gone.\" I glanced at the door to the crawlspace. \n\n\"Come on, let's go,\" Jess said and began walking out of the room. \n\n\"Jess, don't go into that crawlspace ever again, no matter what.\"\n\nShe looked at me with worried eyes but nodded in agreement, which made me relax a little. \n\nIt's almost midnight now and Jess is soundly asleep beside me. I don't know what the fuck is going on and I want to figure it out. I decided that I'm going to reach out to the old tenants tomorrow, I have their details after all. Maybe they can shed some light on this. I really hope Jess listens and doesn't go into that crawlspace. I have a really bad feeling about all this.",

        "author": "PlatformLazy6066",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10nleul/hi_there_welcome_to_your_favorite_football_club/",
        "text": "For context, I’m a manager here working in this stadium so yes, my words are truly safe. I have worked here since 2017 and would recommended you to follow these rules. These rules are written on a piece of paper that I handed to you before you sit down at your seat, please read them during or before match if you forgot a rule or two. This is for your own safety.\n\n1) If any circumstances your favorite club is playing against their rival but the time they stated the match will take around is 7-8 PM, DO NOT. And I repeat. DO NOT GO TO THE MATCH ON ANY UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES. If you did buy the ticket, follow rule 1A.\n\n1A) Please pray to the god you believe him because even I can’t stop this now. You have bought the ticket which mean you HAVE to go.\nGod bless your soul. \n\n2) When entering the stadium, a security guard will come and check your baggage if you have one. No matter how suspicious they look please for the love of god follow them. Your ending shall not be merciful if you do not. There are many “suspicious” looking security guards but there are also fakes out there, if you accidentally gave your baggage to the fake security guard, I’m so so sorry. You may only realize this after you sit down at your seat but oh god, I’m deeply sorry. But I’ll tell you the appearance of the real security guards.\n\n2A) Their size is huge. Giant like-almost. But they will wear a cap all time. If you remember that your security guard looked like this then you’re safe.\n\n2B) Their height is small, smaller than average men. They are like 5’6. They will have blonde hair, sometimes they can be brown, black or ginger red but never any other colors. If your security guard appearance is like this then you’re safe.\n(If they don’t fall on any of these category, I’m deeply and very sorry but instead of you having a horrific end, your loved ones will instead, every single one of them. I’m deeply and so so sorry again. May god bless their souls.)\n\n3) When the match is going on, there will be some “strange” looking people beside you just watching. If they try to talk to you, it’s best to completely ignore them unless they asked about a footballer, if you don’t reply to them about this, I’m sorry. However you can escape this by making a bet with them and try predicting the score or a goal, if you failed to do so, oh god. I’m sorry. Your end will be more horrific than before.\n\n4) If the stadium is awfully quiet and not loud like usual, please refer to 4A.\n\n4A) Immediately get down below your seat and lay down there while covering your heads, and DO NOT. Any circumstances look up until the commentator says “GOAALLL!!” But watch out, the commentator sometimes will trick you so look out for the crowd cheer noise for your own safety.\n\n5) If the scorer comes up and celebrating and then proceeds to look at you, DO NOT look unhappy or any other emotions. Be happy for them. Failure to do so will get you an personal “invitation” to their dressing room. And you ABSOLUTELY do not wanna go in there. Your end will be horrific.\n\n6) Under any circumstances should you go on a match that is on wednesday or tuesday. The fans will be aggressive especially on these days. We do not know the reason why they are aggressive on these specific days but it’s best advised for you to not go there.\n\n7) I advise for you to only eat food that the owner said had a “green sticker” on them, you may not see it but the owner can. You can ask to them about this. They will not lie. They are very prideful about their food safety. And I also advise for you to not drink any alcohol or any substances that might make you a bit chaotic during match because many fans have done this and caused disturbance during match for others. If you do the same then our security team will have to take you away and “take care” of you personally. No, anyone didn’t tell the security. The security just know.\n\n8) You may use your phone during the match to record a moment of anything special or anything else but you CAN’T NOT record the entire match. And no, you can’t take photos. Only the crew down there right beside the pitch can. Our security team will know if you’re recording the entire match. Let’s just say they have exceptional sense.\n\n9) If you’re sitting beside a team dressing room and wanna go for a handshake or an autograph, etc, follow these additional rules.\n\n9A) Please be a VIP or a really devoted fan. Our security will know if you’re a devoted fan or not. \n\n9B) If the footballer hand looks a bit off, even the tiniest bit like extra fingers, random hole on their hand, DO NOT shake it. After you leave the stadium, a horrific end will occur to you if you did shake them.\n\n9C) If you got an autograph and there’s a red dot somewhere on the paper/merch/etc. that they wrote it on, DISPOSE OF IT NOW. I don’t really care if you don’t wanna do it or not but for your own safety and your loved ones, please for the love of god, DISPOSE OF IT. The dot will be quite large so you can easily notice it.\n\n10) If you wanna go to the bathroom or just leave for a certain moment, leave something important for you at your seat. The others will know it’s your seat and won’t sit on them. Don’t worry, in our stadium, the fans never steal.\n\n11) A middle aged white man who is fairly fat will come sit right beside you to your right. Agree to EVERYTHING he says. Unless it’s anything bad about your football club, then you can defend them. He’ll understand and won’t talk bad about them again.\n\n12) If for any reasons you noticed something is off about the footballer’s face or body, please do not look at them for the rest of the match, yes you can still see him when you’re viewing the match itself but don’t look at him intentionally again for the rest of the match. Don’t worry, they will be noticeable from any far range so you don’t have to worry. And if they’re celebrating and looks at you like rule 5, follow 12A.\n\n12A) Simply close your eyes and just cheer and look happy like how other fans do. You got 15 seconds to do this after you realized the footballer is looking at you. If you didn’t do it in time, pray to the god you believe in. Your end will not be merciful.\n\nThank you for coming to our stadium, we hope you had a good time in here while watching the match. Please follow these rules again if you wanna come back, that’s all!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10nkzt3/i_was_hired_as_a_security_guard_to_protect_a/",
        "text": "It’s hard to trust anyone after what happened but knowing that the public will not be informed about the truth has me worried beyond belief. Maybe because it’s all too far-fetched? Hell, I don’t know. I suppose I should be careful with what I say, but I now know something that was obviously intended to be kept a secret. I don’t exactly know how deep they’ve got their hands in everything but after I share this with you here, I am sure someone will be sent to track me down and erase me from existence. Someone is always watching. However, after everything that happened, I don’t really fear that or even death right now because there’s something else out there that is much more horrifying than simply taking your last breath. I need to tell anyone I can about *everything* that happened when I was a security guard for this steel plant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter I finish writing this, I will submit my knowledge to a news station, but I’ve decided to share information *here* that is more descriptive, and I will do my best to include conversations that were important. It should go without saying that some identities will be protected, security guards usually call fellow guards by last name, but I think I should be careful anyways. All you need to know right now is that this happened in the states.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me tell you a bit about myself. You can just call me Dee. I am a 42-year-old single male and after being hospitalized from a gunshot wound from active duty, I was honorably discharged with compensation packets. I am not proud of this, but I started drinking after the swelling and antibiotics were gone. Being hit with this quick depression, I never wanted to commit to anything other than occasionally attempting to work out and get through the pain. I was gaining extra weight, I hated the idea of counseling and thought about getting a dog, but my pain subsided enough for me to finally say enough *was* enough. I was losing money and it was time to get a job, so I put in several applications online to become a security guard or anything that welcomed my background in the military. Stick to what you know, right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor years, I made my way through the world of being a security guard (with the occasional aches and stiffness) and guarded all sorts of off-limit areas, government facilities, banks, offices, factories you name it. Some employers even welcomed my license to carry a firearm. I tried not to lean towards jobs like that, but when the money is right, the money is right. Now becoming more comfortable in the field of being both an armed and unarmed security guard, I sort of made a name for myself and would eventually do my own freelance work for various companies in private security.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome people paid top dollar to guard things that even I had no true knowledge of what it could be. Those jobs came with signing NDAs, and I won’t lie though, I enjoyed the feeling some of those jobs gave me. Especially the ones needing people with the experience I have to just keep their eyes peeled for armed intruders and to fire on-site like I was in some action movie where Arnold Schwarzenegger would pop out and start a gunfight. On regular security jobs you are not permitted to take another person's life and use deadly force, but for private security, things can get more serious. This particular job, after a while, became very much like that. But far, far worse than I could ever imagine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was contacted by a company, and obviously I will not be naming here, to guard multiple buildings located in \\[REDACTED\\] for both day and night shifts. The area itself was barren with a patch of forest to the south of the facility and owned property lines fenced off and marked with “no trespassing” signs surrounding the zone for miles. There was a total of six buildings to guard: Buildings A through F with A being the closest to the parking lot. Railroad tracks were behind two main operating buildings that were labeled C and D. Building A was where they assembled parts and a conveyor belt ran all the way through to building C to deliver scrap. Buildings A and B were opposite each other and by them was a trailer for workers, our guard building and a yard for trucks to load supplies with dumpsters and a shed for maintenance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOpposite that was the parking lot and our main gate with a guard that seems to be there 24/7. We can just call him Phil. Buildings E and F were used for housing supplies and building B was basically empty, save for some discarded equipment. The building itself was constructed farther away from the other ones. There's a window in the guard's office that allows you to see the gap between B and A. I didn’t really know what that building was used for, but I actually enjoyed guarding this place for the nine months I was there. Until they asked me to sign some documents in the guards building. Then, everything spiraled straight into a nightmare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe day started out like any normal day. I don’t like being early or late, so I showed up right as my day shift was about to start as always. I was greeted by Phil, showed him my ID card and was cleared to enter. I then pulled into the parking lot, got out and headed for the guard's office. Looking around, I noticed two nondescript vehicles parked on the dirt road where deliveries would be with traffic cones placed by one of the vans. Must be some inspectors, I thought. Usually, I am told when they have people like that come to do their checks by phone the day prior and this place is huge, so I figured they’d have a team to help, and it might be one of those “sorry forgot to mention” things management pulled. Once I made my way closer to the guard's office and glanced over at building B, there was a group of men with jumpsuits and respirators gathered around the front of it. They were installing a card reader on the main entrance doors, but the actual door was gone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started walking a bit slower and then noticed the welding machine. Trailing behind the other men, there was an industrial and very expensive looking hand truck being pushed and supported by three more of them near the opening. It was carrying a brand new heavily reinforced door. That was definitely something you don’t see every day. Shaking off the weird feeling I got from seeing that, I swiped my key card and opened the guard's office door noticing I had guests seemingly waiting for my arrival. The man in charge of all operations, Sam, was with two people in black suits standing near the surveillance station. I rarely see this guy ever. I then noticed an extra monitor was installed as well, watching those men outside install this new door. One of the suited men held a packet of paper and the other guard assigned with me, we’ll call him Ray, was already sitting down by one of the windows opposite them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What’s this all about?” I asked Sam. “It’s all right. Just go ahead and clock in then sit down, please.” Sam told me, trying to sound polite and I looked over at the two men before stamping my timecard and sitting down in a chair. The two men looked at each other and the one on the left took a step forward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“A pleasure to meet you. How are you doing today?” He asked with a tone that did not sound friendly in the slightest. Monotone and emotionless. He extended his hand in greeting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Fine.” I shook the man's hand and he continued.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I am special agent Franks, and this is Calloway. We represent Optimal Solutions in a collaborative operation with the United States Government to store medical supplies and other materials that may be hazardous if mistreated.” He set down a stack of papers on the metal desk nearest me. “You can read about us in that packet if you’d like. We need to occupy building B for a period of time since it is not operational here. The area will be disinfected and anything we work on will be contained inside the warehouse. We apologize for any inconvenience.” He paused, probably to see my reaction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Okay.” I said, picking up the sheets of paper and skimming the details about this subcontracting medical research group while listening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I understand this may seem unusual and on short notice for you security guards stationed here. We’ve already spoken with Sam, and he has allowed us access to the building.” He paused again and put his hands on his hips. “Now, the work we do is not only important, but it is crucial we are in a secure location. I would like to explain a few things. Is that alright?” He asked the two of us guards and I glanced over at Ray. Ray shrugged and spoke.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I’m already here, just get on with it.” I nodded my head in agreement and looked back at Franks, handing him the packet of papers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Due to this particular work study, the identities of people involved, and the nature of the work is considered highly classified and any information about this cannot be disclosed to the public. I am sure you have already gathered that we are installing a reinforced door over at building B. We are asking that you include this area in your perimeter checks during daytime. At night, we will be stationing armed men under our direct payroll by those doors. Watching over the camera feed is only required for you then, but you will be given our frequency to speak directly to us on those devices. No one besides us should be allowed access. That door will be used for our personnel only. We are going to be staying within the compound throughout the time we are here. M.R.E. 's have been issued and workers quarters are currently being installed. No one gets in and no one is permitted to leave the premises until we have completed the work or have been given authorization. We have already installed another camera watching that area as well, so it can be easier for you to keep watch while fulfilling your other duties.” He pointed out the monitor. Ray spoke up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Damn. I don’t suppose we aren’t getting paid more for this crap? Keeping quiet and all that.” He asked, chuckling. That was one thing I liked about Ray. We would be on the same tip with money, because I was about to ask about the same thing. He just had the balls to ask first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Your time and service for all of this will cause a substantial increase in your already agreed upon payment arrangements. If you do not wish to participate, you *are* free to leave but you will not be able to return to this area once we have occupied it. If you want to return to work after we are finished, you’ll have to talk to Sam here. Do you have any more questions?” He replied and I thought about why they chose this location of all places. It was basically in the middle of nowhere and I had to wonder about that. This was in the beginning of November, and it was going to be snowing soon. Although, I wasn’t completely shocked. Companies all over the world would occupy facilities for a period of time to store materials, operate in or even collaborate on business within this particular field when supply chain demand was low. Maybe there was something they couldn’t tell us. It seemed to me that they operated through more unconventional methods, but that was obviously between Sam and them and whatever was going on is federal level shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“It sounds like we don’t really have a choice about any of this. What kind of supplies are you talking about, like vaccines and medicine?” I asked. He just remained stoic and replied.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“That is classified information. You are not to share anything about our whereabouts to anyone and if you do it is punishable by law as you will read in the non-disclosure agreement. If you are feeling some... discomfort about this, you of course will be handsomely compensated upon leaving, but unfortunately, we will not be able to offer anything else at this time.” He said, smiling and did not speak for a moment. I had the thought that maybe they were trying to store a new kind of medicine to help fight this recent outbreak and needed to keep a low profile from other competitors or something. I don’t know how any of that works, but I can only speculate because of how brutal the world has been getting over the years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have read reports where the military might need to occupy an area for things like logistics or storing shipments in civilian territory because there was no space for the operation in a base at the time. This is a steel plant, after all. Perfect size for a military operation. They obviously must have deduced that this is one of the more lesser-known steel manufacturers in the U.S. and hasn’t had many intruders in the past. These places are filled with areas where vandals would want to break in or even urban explorers. There is also the risk of armed intruders wanting to rob the place for scrap. Throughout the time I have been here though, no such occurrence has ever happened. It was a pretty lax job and would just include the normal day to day routine and the night shift involved trying to stay awake most of the time. I still was required to keep my pistol on me at all times while patrolling the property though. This new ordeal here actually excited me in a strange way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Okay... How long will you be operating here, and are there any other duties included?” I inquired. I wanted to ask so much more but I knew when to stop prying and could use the extra cash. It’s not like I could just outright ask them: “*Why are you guys using a secluded warehouse for top secret work?”* without them getting to some level of annoyance with my questions. The other man piped up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“As long as it takes for us to finish. Your job will be no different from what you are already doing here. You are free to report any abnormalities you may find concerning at any time. We’re just spending some time in that warehouse and yeah, there may be extra tasks required depending on the situation. You *do* have military experience.” Calloway offered with an attitude I didn’t particularly like. What did he mean by that? They must have spoken with Sam about me and Ray. Ray never served but was on the force some time ago and was permitted to carry. I looked over at Sam briefly and he just gave me a blank stare while scratching the back of his head. Franks spoke again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Have we come to an understanding? We are running out of time. Our work is important, we just want everyone on the same page. Will you adhere to these requirements?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI gave it a once-over in my head, spending a passing moment to get my thoughts right and bury any red flags I may have noticed. This whole meeting happened so suddenly, and I didn’t exactly get a whole lot of time to think about any of this. More money was always a plus too and I opted to play the grunt I was being paid for by saying: “Yes, sir.” then signing the non-disclosure agreement. Ray followed our new “orders” as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next two weeks after this were fairly normal minus the worker that walked out during a shift. I was checking building C and made my way around the perimeter. This was a first for me, but one of the exit doors nearby flew open with a worker in full gear frantically muttering something to himself. I watched as the man walked towards the parking lot while fumbling with his keys and lunchbox then disappeared behind a corner. Just then my radio crackled to life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***“Patrol 1, this is management. We have a worker going home. No action needed. Out.”***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStunned, I stood there for a moment thinking of what could have happened, so I recklessly advanced in his direction. “Wait!” I called out and began jogging his way and made it about twenty or so feet behind him. He did not slow down or stop for me. He continued walking quickly, turning another corner and eventually was out of my sight. I don’t normally act out of impulse, but the manner in which this man left his shift made me anxious. An action like this would probably cause my employer to wonder about me but I didn’t really care at the time. He looked terrified out of his mind. It was someone I was familiar with but never got his name. He’s been here since I arrived, so he had to have been here for over a year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaking my way around the corner, still jogging, I saw that he was already approaching his vehicle and getting in, so I slowed down and eventually stopped. Phil was flagged and he got the gate opened for him. It looked like the guy was shouting at Phil in his car to hurry up. I was standing near the edge of where the parking lot meets the property and Phil noticed me. I could see he looked at me frowning, shrugging his shoulders. When I asked one of the supervisors about it later, he informed me that the employee was suddenly hit with a panic attack and began feeling claustrophobic to the point where he had to go home. He marked him down on an attendance sheet and looked up at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I hate to say this... I think the guy is on drugs or something. Keep an eye on him, yeah? He wasn’t threatening or anything but… still. Josh has been working here for three years and only had one incident with a machine but it was pretty moderate. No one acts like that here. I’m going to have a talk with him, that’s for sure. I just let the guy go home to calm down for the rest of the day. I can’t deal with any freak-outs, we have a business to run.” He explained and I agreed. I told him I would keep a close eye on him and got back to my duties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother two weeks passed and, on a Wednesday, when Ray told me something that had me a little worried about these people occupying the building. Monday through Wednesday I have the day shift. Wednesday through Saturday is my night shift, and he has the opposite schedule. “Dee, you got a minute?” He asked while I was about to clock out. He had a troubled expression on his face. “Yeah. Everything alright?” I asked, glancing over at the monitors. He also looked at the monitors, showing these people hauling in huge computers and for some reason, large loudspeakers through the warehouse shutter door in building B and then looked back at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I don’t know, dude. I was doing a sweep by Sam's office and overheard him on the phone with someone.” He put his hands up in a defensive gesture. “You know me, I don’t screw around, and I wasn’t trying to eavesdrop. I just happened to be near his office with a janitor mopping when we both heard him yelling in there. He was fuckin’ loud, dude. The door was shut but it sounded like something bad was going on. I heard him shouting shit like: \\* *How come I was never told about this? We already had a deal! \\** Then we heard something break in there. We just looked at each other and went our separate ways after that.” He finished by wiping some sweat from his forehead. “What the hell could all of that be about?” He asked, quietly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Sounds to me like we are in for more than just being guards now.” I replied with a pit in my stomach. If something wasn’t sitting right with me at first, there was definitely something weird going on now. I glanced at the monitor with the reinforced door with the two guards armed to the teeth and wondered what could be going on that we don’t know about. Looking back, I should have just found a new gig right then and there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom here, workers inside buildings A and C were complaining about a buzzing in their ears and having high stress levels. I would sometimes hear strange whirring noises when I would go by the three buildings A, B and C. Not anything from the work here, but more like a tinnitus. I figured that it was some kind of machinery they had in there that caused the ringing, like some kind of emission frequency or something similar. I did see them haul in huge machines and various computers throughout this whole process too, so I can only speculate. Maybe something with the speakers. This only piqued my curiosity even more. Just what the hell are they doing in there? Having a fucking concert? However, before I could even begin to think about bringing my concerns up to Sam, there was another duty added to my checklist right around then. One of the mill supervisors called me when I was at home to inform me that there will be a construction crew digging below building B. Apparently to fix some issues with a piping system underneath the building that was causing some kind of leak. We were instructed to watch over that area as well once the leak was taken care of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Does it maybe have something to do with what’s causing the buzzing in everyone's ears?” I said and I heard him chuckle. It was probably a stupid question, but I asked anyway. “I don’t know, we had to shut down operations today and tomorrow, so you guys got a day off while they fumigate whatever this is and clear it. We haven’t been down there in years, so it doesn’t really come as a surprise since they got an operation going on. Only natural to find some old pipes that may have burst. Maybe it was an accident. They better be more careful with whatever the hell they’re doing, but if they clear it then I don’t really see the problem. As long as no one gets killed, I guess.” He told me, chuckling again. “I’m confused.” I only said. “Yeah, you and me both buddy. I’ll talk to you later.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first day I had to work with the extra duty included started off with me spilling coffee all over my work pants causing me to almost be late for once. The construction crews were to be on-site and would remain underneath the building for the next month or so. Sam seemed to be pretty upset about this, and it was earlier confirmed when Ray spoke about the phone call he overheard. I can only assume, at least. There was a huge hole they dug just to the east side of the building and for up to twelve hours a day, we would see the workers doing their thing. Throughout all of it, I couldn’t really keep tabs on everything they were doing exactly. No, my workload was getting in the way of me trying to catch a look at anything out of the ordinary. Minus this entire crew being here and the special agents, of course.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs time went on, we were given tasks like helping with maintenance or patrolling the outer edge of the property for a time, as if someone would be there. We were to report any suspicious persons and keep our pistols on us. Plus, that ringing would sometimes still bother me, and I was starting to get really anxious ever since. If I was sitting by the cameras, I would catch myself fidgeting my leg up and down so fast it was like my nephews' video game controllers vibrating. I would have to grab my leg and force myself to relax. Not only was I stressed about these new patrols, but it was something else. Like as if an uncontrollable urge to either bite my nails off or scratch at an area would persist. After a week passed, we got another hire to come in and patrol with me and Ray on the night shifts only. He was a shorter middle-aged guy, really quiet but did his job well and his name was Jeff. I never got any other information about him, but this is around the time where things started to get for lack of a better term; scary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was mid-December and the construction crews finally finished up their work. At around one in the morning when Jeff and I were monitoring the camera feed. I was shaking my leg so fast it was causing a slight ticking noise to occur as the wind outside howled. No snow was on the forecast, just a bitter chill in the air mixed with the darkness of night. Obviously when the night shift rolls around, there’s no workers present in the mill and the two armed guards are stationed in front of the new door, decked out in urban BDU’s and winter gear. It was here when looking at the monitors displaying the camera feeds that I spotted movement near one of the windows located on the second level of building B. It was through a feed that had to be panned over to get a better look.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt first, I could only recognize the outline of a shape, but it almost looked like a door opening. Clearly, someone wearing light colored clothes appeared past the open door crouching down. It was already pitch-black outside and the resolution from the camera wasn’t all that great, but we could still see them. “Zoom in, right there.” I told Jeff who was already on it and zoomed in to where I pointed. It was a person and I noticed they had something that looked like a phone in their hand. I had no knowledge of how to even get up there from inside. They must have found a ladder or emergency stairwell for roof access.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure enough, I began to see the person crawling on a ledge and eventually made their way to their feet. It was here when I noticed the person was wearing a lab coat. After I frantically searched through binders and folders that might contain the map of the interior, I found it and confirmed there was indeed a roof access staircase inside building B. I looked up to the feed again, still baffled, noticing they began climbing onto the roof. Just then I remembered what that rude agent, Calloway, said to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“*You are free to report any abnormalities you may find concerning at any given time.*”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI grabbed my radio and changed the channel to their frequency.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“We’ve got a situation; someone is on top of building B!” I shouted over the radio, and I made my way to the door. I looked back to Jeff. “I’ve got this handled, monitor everything here and if things go south, you know what to do!” I unholstered my pistol and Jeff gave me a stern look. He nodded and I got the door open. I sprinted to building B and didn’t stop until I got to the entrance of the building. The armed guards had their rifles aimed up at the top of the building and that’s when I saw him. The person on the roof was holding up some kind of device.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“*It’s too late! I already sent it to them. They are on their way!”*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe man shouted down at us and began laughing like he was on the verge of a mental breakdown. The armed guards had flashlight attachments and were keeping their aim on his torso. Two red dots were focused on his lab attire by the ID tag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was about ten feet away from the commandos and one of them noticed me. “GET BACK TO YOUR BUILDING, NOW!” He shouted and I jumped at the sudden commanding voice. Just then, there was that ringing in my ears again. I was so confused and felt a ball form in my chest and stomach. I couldn’t quite gauge what the hell was happening just then. I felt like this was some military drill or something to see what we would do in case of an emergency like this. That ringing persisted, it *was* tolerable, but sounded like there were speakers all around me blasting this dog whistle kind of noise. I shook my head and got back to my senses and the ringing was to a minimum now. The man on the roof looked to be a scientist or researcher that must have been helping out with whatever they are doing here. I couldn’t see his body entirely but now; the man was holding his ears with the device still in his hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*“You made this mess!”* The man kept shouting this over and over until I heard the gunshot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother operative must have gotten up there. My heart sank when the spray of crimson misted in the air as the hole burst through the man's forehead. His arms went to his sides, and he slumped forward, falling the two stories into a crumpled heap on the ground in front of the soldiers. The device the man was holding lay broken in pieces on the concrete next to the blood that began pooling around his body. My eyes went wide with fear, and I couldn’t stop my heart from pounding. I’ve seen death before, many times... But the context here had me questioning my reality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*“*Hostile neutralized. Clean up unit, come to the entrance.” One of the men reported it on their radio.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should have left. I should have said to hell with the money and gone home, but now I was right in the stink of this crap. I just witnessed not only something that wasn't meant for civilians to see, but a murder. Alarm bells began going off despite the ringing that still persisted. Before I knew it, the soldier closest to me aimed his rifle at me and paced forward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Woah, woah! What the hell!?” I was blinded by the flashlight and raised my hands up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“STAY WHERE YOU ARE!” He shouted and I kept my hands up with the gun dangling from my finger. “Easy! I’m not a threat!” I tried pleading with this guy and did my best to keep my gaze fixed on the gas mask the operative was wearing. It was here where a constant flood of intrusive thoughts invaded my mind. Who was that scientist talking about? Who is on their way? Could they hear the ringing too? Was their gear suppressing them from hearing it? Was I being exposed to radiation? Are these guys even Military? Now I had this sudden urge to draw my pistol and fire upon them but what good would that even do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“DROP YOUR WEAPON SLOWLY!” He barked and I slowly put my pistol on the cold pavement. If I was going to do anything right, I had to stay alive and play along with their demands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo keep things as short as I possibly can, I was rushed back to the guards building and told to stay put until they finished handling the situation. We were told to not call for authorities, as a unit was already on its way for medical care. A soldier remained inside the guards building with us until our shift ended. However, we did not get to go home and nobody else came in to work that day... It was at this point where the entire facility had been officially taken over and captured by a renegade force that snuck their ranks into the United States Government and posed as anything other than a threat to humankind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe commandos were already freaky enough, I should have known better than to sit back and allow this to happen, but it was already too late. My gun was left outside and undoubtedly taken by them. The jig was up, and Jeff and I were taken hostage inside the guard's office.",

        "text": "I sat on my sofa and  continued to scroll online, looking for some gigs to make some quick cash. I was recently fired from my job  and the danger of coming up short on rent was soon to  be  imminent. The scrolling was about to stop  when a post caught my eye.\n\n“Looking for a babysitter that can work from 3-6 AM 7 days a week. Starting at $285/hr.”\n\n*$285 an hour?*\n\nIt was shocking to see such an insanely high hourly pay rate, but  there was something off with this post. \n\n*What could the parents be  doing at those hours every single day, and why are they  paying a whopping $285?*\n\nIt was evident that there was a catch to this.  I clicked “Read more” on the post.\n\n“Basically just the title. We live in the Beverly hills area and have some important business we must attend to each night at 3:00 AM. we are offering such high pay because I know the time is at an odd hour.” \n\nIt was apparent this was a huge risk, but the promise of $285 an hour was too grand to ignore.   I clicked on the user's profile and sent them a direct message.\n\n“Hey, I saw your post. I am interested in babysitting for your children. Could I get some more details?”\n\nI placed my phone down on the couch and turned to face the television. It was difficult to focus on the television while anxiously wondering if the right decision was made by messaging that user. \n\n*DING*\n\nThe anxious pondering had been  interrupted when my phone got a notification from the user I had messaged just a minute earlier.\n\n“Hi, thank you for sending me a message. This is Zachorio. I have a wife, Soryin, and two kids, Orvo,  age 6, and Fern, Age 10. We have reviewed every one who has sent us a message and we believe you are the best fit for this opportunity. Please meet us TONIGHT at 2:30 AM for your first night of Babysitting.  I will call you at 2:00 AM and tell you the address for our estate. Thank you, and have a good rest of your evening.”\n\nShivers ran through me once I was done reading the message. The unusual names were off-putting,  as well as  the fact that they expected me to start the very same night.  I double checked the post, it had been posted just 2 minutes  ago.  It  seemed unlikely that anyone messaged them before me. \n\nAfter a few minutes of considering the decision, I came to the conclusion that I was just being paranoid and that these were most likely just some odd rich parents who had some sketchy business to attend to.  I picked up my phone and typed out a message. \n\n“Okay, sounds good!”\n\nThe message instantly said “Seen”.  \n\n*Hm, that’s strange. Has he just been sitting in the conversation this whole time?*\n\nI re-assured myself that I was just being paranoid and that I had nothing to worry about.  It was only 8:30 PM, so there was some time to kill.  the next few hours were spent watching television and biting my nails clean from the anxiety. the gut feeling that this was a bad idea wouldn’t leave, but I repeatedly pushed the thought away and focused on the grand promise of $285 dollars an hour. As an attempt to keep my focus on the money, a little bit of math was done. \n\n*$285 an hour would equal $855 a day, $5,985 a week, and $312,075 a year!* \n\nI  sat in awe at the numbers and was no longer anxious,  instead,  full of pure excitement about this amazing opportunity. The time was now 1:50 AM , meaning he was going to call me in 10 minutes.  After getting dressed  I sat back down and anxiously awaited his phone call. \n\nThe clock hit 2:00 am and instantly after that Zachorio was calling me. \n\n“Hello!” I said.\n\n“Hi, Mark Barlowe.” an older sounding man replied in a deep tone.\n\nThe use of my full name was very strange. Of course he could see my full name on my profile of the social media site we were using, but still, no normal person would address  someone by their full name on a first phone call.  \n\n“Hi, how are you doing tonight?” I asked.\n\nAfter 5 seconds, there was no answer, only static. I began to bite my nails.\n\n“What are you speaking of? I am not doing anything to anyone or anything that goes by the name of ‘tonight’. I am slightly offended by such an accusation, but seeing as we have determined you are the best fit for this opportunity, I will let it slide. But this is your only warning.” Zachorio replied, sounding unusually distraught. \n\n*What on earth is this guy rambling on about? Is he fucking insane?*\n\n“My apologies sir, I was just asking if your night was going pleasant.” I replied, trying to keep my cool.\n\n“Ah, I see. My night is going very pleasant, per usual,” Zachorio replied.\n\nHe gave me the address for the home and ended the phone call. \n\nmy hand was turning the front door handle,  but paused. I realized just how foolish it would be to go to an insane sounding man's house without a weapon. \n\nMy room contained a handgun, so I quickly walked in and grabbed it. \n\nI entered my old rundown Nissan and entered the home address into my phone. \n\n*The address was written down perfectly, why isn’t anything showing up?*\n\n“Hey, nothing is coming up when I enter the address on my phone.” I hit send, and my message instantly had “Seen” under it once more. Just as quickly after, a message from Zachorio appeared, without the typing bubble  even making an appearance.  \n\n“I  will shine a large beacon starting now.”\n\nThe message brought on a confused daze.  I looked up and saw a large blue beacon shining into the night sky.\n\n“What.. the.. Fuck..” I muttered to myself in awe.\n\nThe keys in the ignition were turned and the drive towards the beacon began.  Focusing on the road became increasingly difficult as the journey to the beacon came closer and closer to an end. \n\nAfter a while of driving, I approached the beacon and slowed the car to a crawl in front of it.  The beacon suddenly shut off and the  headlights illuminated a very tall middle aged man. The way he stood was very stiff and unusual. \n\nI exited my car and walked towards him.\n\n“Hi, this is mark.” I said to the man.\n\n“Oh yes,  we have been expecting you. Please come right in.” he said in what sounded like a sarcastic  tone while gesturing to the dirt beneath us.\n\nLooking around, it was evident that we were in the middle of a dirt patch with no property in sight.  \n\n“Shit.” I muttered under my breath, realizing this had clearly been a trap. \n\nZachorio began to walk towards me and I placed my hand on my firearm in case he tried to pull anything. The grip strengthened when he was right next to me, but loosened when he continued to calmly walk past me. he was bent over and pulling something. He grunted as he continued to pull, and a large bunker door revealed itself from under the dirt. \n\nAt that point there was no doubt in my mind that this whole situation was incredibly bizarre, but I felt a sense of safety from carrying the handgun. The bunker led into a beautifully decorated living room. My nerves began to act up and I entered an unwelcome state of hesitancy. \n\n“Well, what are you waiting for?” Zachorio asked after a few minutes of my hesitancy. \n\n“U-uh nothing. Are your children awake right now?” I asked.\n\n“Yes, they are in the playroom on the 6th floor. That is where you will be going tonight.” Zachorio responded. \n\n*How many floors does this place have?*\n\n“Okay! Well, don’t you have some business to attend to?” I asked. \n\nHe put his watch up to his face.\n\n“Not for 30 more minutes. Why are you in such a rush for me to leave?” He asked me. I could detect a strong hint of anger in his voice. \n\nI took a step back.\n\n“I’m not! I-.. I was just wondering!” I replied before letting out a nervous laugh. \n\n“Okay. Well, I asked you to be here 30 minutes early because I am going to watch your performance of babysitting my children for 30 minutes.” \n\nMy heart skipped a beat when I imagined the scene of awkwardly babysitting his children whilst he creepily watched me do so in a corner. \n\n“Okay.” I replied. \n\nI gulped down my fear and started down the stairs. Each step creaked in a way that indicated they hadn’t been stepped on for a long while. After reaching the bottom of the stairs, I paused to take in the view. The room was rich with sleek white furniture, each piece looking as if it had never once been used. \n\n“Go on now, down the next flight of stairs.” Zachroio instructed, sounding angry. \n\n“Yes sir.” I replied.\n\nAfter turning to the left and going down the next flight of stairs, I stopped to take in the view once more. The room was completely identical to the last one.\n\n*Another identical living room? What the hell is this place?*\n\n“So.. you guys really like living, huh?” I said with a chuckle, trying to crack a joke. \n\n“Why are you accusing me of such things? Stop, and hurry down the stairs!” Zachorio Retorted.\n\n*Okay, something is SERIOUSLY wrong with this guy..*\n\nAfter going down the next 3 identical  floors, I paused. \n\n“So, your children are on that floor below?” I asked, pointing to the next staircase \n\n“I shall not answer that; you already know the answer.” Zachorio snapped back. \n\n*Did this guy live in a basement his whole life or something?*\n\nAfter reaching the bottom of the stairs, I closed my eyes,  desperately hoping that two children would actually be in front of me upon opening them.  My eyes slowly opened, revealing the peculiar scene of two  children, sitting unusually upright and tense, staring at a dinky pet toy beneath them. \n\n“Hi! I am Mark. I’ll be your babysitter for tonight.” I explained to the children. \n\nThere was no response. They continued to intently stare at  the toy on the ground. I looked around and realized that this room was also identical to all of the others, and that this was the bottom floor. \n\nUpon turning around, the view of  Zachorio  tensely standing against the wall, observing me, became apparent. \n\nI took a seat on the sofa.\n\n“So, you guys wanna do anything?” I asked the kids.\n\nOnce again, there was no response of any kind from the children. \n\nI turned to face Zachorio, looking for some kind of advice. After a few seconds of staring, no help was given. \n\n“Is there anything in particular that you would like me to do?” I asked Zachorio.\n\nFear overwhelmed me when  his face suddenly became intensely red with anger. \n\n“*THAT IS YOUR JOB TO FIGURE OUT!!”* Zachorio belched deafeningly. \n\n“Sir! I-I  am very sorry. I- was just..”  I started\n\n“*DO NOT COME UP WITH EXCUSES!”* Zachorio retorted just before beginning to swiftly walk in my direction. \n\nPanic and fear washed over me, causing me to pull out my handgun and aim it directly at him.\n\n“BACK OFF!” I screamed, trying my best to sound and appear intimidating. \n\nHe didn’t stop.\n\n“I *SAID* BACK. OFF!” I screamed once more, becoming increasingly anxious as he came closer.\n\nAfter he got dangerously close to me, I closed my eyes and shakily pulled the trigger. \n\n*CLINK* \n\nMy eyes opened and were met with the horrifying scene of Zachorio continuing to effortlessly walk towards me. There was a damaged bullet on the ground just behind him. \n\nI shot the gun at him once more, watching as the bullet instantly  ricocheted off him and leaving no damage. \n\n*Shit!*\n\nZachorio grunted as he easily picked me up and carried me above his head. I struggled and screamed as he carried me to the other side of the room. He switched to carrying me with one hand, and used the other hand to push the bookshelf in the room aside, revealing a secret metal door. He opened the door, revealing a completely empty room that was entirely covered in metal. I screamed in pain after being forcefully thrown onto the ground of the room.\n\n“YOU ARE FIRED!” Zachorio screamed just before slamming the door shut. \n\nI scurried to my feet and ran to the door. \n\n“LET ME OUT!!” I screamed while relentlessly banging on the door until my knuckles bled.\n\nI started to shoot my gun at the door, but felt absolutely defeated as each bullet  effortlessly ricocheted off the wall, leaving not even the tiniest crack. \n\n“*AUGH!”* I yelped when one of the bullets hit my hand. Blood began to stream down, and fast. Out of sheer panic, I took off my shirt and tied it around the wound the best I could. \n\n“PLEASE I AM BLEEDING YOU HAVE TO LET ME OUT!!”  I screamed, desperately hoping that he would believe me.\n\n“You say that you are bleeding?” Zachroio called out, sounding slightly excited. \n\n“YES! PLEASE HELP ME!” I cried out, but wished I hadn’t after noticing his excitement. \n\nFootsteps started in the direction of the door, and eventually it began to unlock. The door opened, revealing Zachorio. Something was awfully different about him, though. He was wearing the most incomprehensible and bizarre clothes I had ever seen, and he was holding a metal cup.\n\n“*ORVO! FERN! EMOC EREH SIHT TNATSNI!”* Zachorio shouted to his children in a never before heard language. \n\nHis children instantly replied by standing up and staying still right next to him. Suddenly, their eyes all began to glow a dark red. \n\n*If this isn’t a dream, I don’t know what is.*\n\nZachorio and his children charged towards me at a rapid pace. I tried to grab my phone to call the police, but  before I knew it, I was laying on the ground, paralyzed, and  Zachorio and his children were all gathered next to me. Zachorio was holding my phone over me, as if to taunt me before throwing it at the wall, causing it to completely crumple in on itself. I cried as I stared at my only lifeline laying on the ground, completely broken beyond repair. \n\nI stared in horror as Zachorio’s glowing red eyes stared deeply into mine as his tongue involuntarily jerked in random directions out of his mouth, almost like a broken reptile of sorts. The last thing I remember was turning to the right and seeing the gut-wrenching scene of Orvo and Fern looking extremely giddy while collecting my  blood into their metal  cup.\n\nI awoke some time later on the cold metal floor, feeling extremely lightheaded. I wanted to get up, but my stomach was threatening to empty itself. I slowly moved my eyes, scanning the room, only seeing the cold metal ceiling which was identical to the floor.  After a few minutes, I had gained the courage to sit up. My hand had a carefully and perfectly placed bandage on it. Upon looking at my hand, it began to ache incredibly.\n\nI struggled to my feet and looked around the room, the only thing that was new was a metal table which upon further inspection contained a bunch of your run of the mill medical supplies. I looked at a medicine bottle labeled “IBUPROFEN.” After glancing at the bottle, and then my hand, I settled on swallowing two tablets. I jumped when footsteps started in the direction of the door. The footsteps were none other than Zachorio's. The door creaked open, revealing the sickening sight of Zachorio wheeling in a hospital bed that was attached to health monitoring devices. \n\n“Hey, what's going on?” I asked shakily with paranoia overwhelming me. \n\n*“SILENCE!”* Zachorio screamed, causing me to flinch and began to cry.\n\nI began to hyperventilate from pure fear and panic, the reality of the situation was just too extreme for my mind to comprehend properly.  Everything began to blur, and it felt like an extreme struggle just to  breathe.\n\n“ORVO, FERN! TNATSNI SIHT NAM EHT NO SISYLARAP ECUDNI!” Zachorio instructed his children. \n\n*What is that language? It sounds like English, but it also doesn't…*\n\nZachorios children appeared  within an instant. Their faces were hauntingly expressionless, almost as if they were deceased. The red, uncanny glow returned in the childrens and Zachorios' eyes.\n\nZachorio and his children began to slowly walk towards me. As I started to step backwards, a slight smirk formed on their faces. After a few more steps, their smirks had increased to an insanely wide and gaping smile. Eventually they had completely cornered me, and  absolute terror enveloped every atom inside of me. \n\n“PLEASE STOP!” I begged.\n\n“PLEASE, *STOP!”*  I repeated, this time sobbing.\n\nThey didn’t stop. Second by second, they were growing increasingly closer to me. I covered my head with my arms and slid down the wall onto the floor.  It was becoming too much, I desperately craved for *everything* to stop. Even death seemed better than the incomprehensible fate I was due to endure shortly.  I slowly removed my arms from my head, and was met with the sickening sight of Zachorio and his children reaching their hands out to me with impossibly wide smiles.\n\nMy life began to flash before my eyes as I truly believed that I would die. I felt pure and total regret for the foolish, *foolish* decision of not listening to my gut.  Suddenly, I felt the cruel sensation of  six incredibly cold hands touching me.\n\n“SISYLARAP ECUDNI!” they all chanted at once. \n\nA scream attempted to escape from me when I felt a jolting shock, but nothing came out. I continued to try and scream but to no avail. I then tried to move my legs, but there were none to move. It was then I realized there was *nothing* for me to move.  It felt as if I were nothing but a ball of consciousness in an eternal black void.  In an instant, I regained my sight. The colors were too bright for me to process for a few moments. I fell into a confused  and terror filled daze when  I was finally able to fully process the scene. \n\nI was laying on a bed, looking up into a small mirror. The mirror contained the view of Orvo and Fern appearing to get ready to make an incision in my head.  I tried to move, but I was still unable. Zachorio was holding a bright green squirming insect with some tweezers, examining it carefully.   \n\n“Orvo, Fern, erom ecno ti ecudni .kcab thgis dna gniraeh sih  sah ydaerla eh .ffo gniraew ylwols si sisylaraP”  Zachorio calmly instructed to his children\n\nI craved to understand the bizarre language that he spoke.\n\nOrvo and Fern brought their hands into view, and they began to slowly creep closer and closer to me. It was almost as if they got  an amusement out of making the experience as slow and as fear inducing as possible. I wasn’t scared anymore, though; going back into that black void sounded a million times better than staying here. Able to hear and see, but not being able to do anything about it.  \n\nThe children's hand touched me, and unexpectedly, my movement fully returned. I instantly shot up in the hospital bed and took in huge lungfuls of oxygen. Zachorio looked furious, and his children looked remorseful, as if they knew they had done something wrong and were fearful of the punishment they would receive.  \n\nI jumped out of the bed but was instantly grabbed by Zachorio.  I struggled and screamed as his arms tightened around me, making it incredibly difficult to breathe. Eventually , I felt totally and utterly defeated. I stopped screaming and struggling, and immediately after, Zachorio screamed in distress and dropped me to the ground, almost as if me being calm physically pained him.\n\n*Did I just figure out his weakness?*\n\nI slowly and calmly got to my feet while Zachorio grew a frustrated look on his face. I walked over to Zachorio and calmly tapped his shoulder, resulting in him being hurled across the room and slammed into the wall. He groaned in pain and yelled profanities at me.\n\n*His weakness is calmness!* \n\nRemaining calm, i walked over to the hospital bed and looked down at a notebook titled \n\n“seiduts revo ekaT”\n\n*These are english letters, but what are those words?*\n\nAfter minutes of staring at the book, my brain clicked. \n\n*It’s in reverse! That’s the language he was speaking, too!* \n\nI read the notebook title backwards and sounded it out.\n\n“Take…Over…Studies. Take over studies!” \n\nI heard a door open and turned to see Zachorio limping out of the door and then ran up the stairs, his children following shortly after. \n\nI flipped open the notebook and translated the first page from reverse.\n\n“*DAY 1*\n\n*I have officially lured two children into my trap. I have named them Orvo and Fern.”*\n\nI flipped to the next page.\n\n“*DAY 2*\n\n*I have officially given Orvo and Fern the parasitic implant procedure. The procedure was successful. They now possess the powers and cravings necessary to aid me on my journey. They listen to commands well.”*\n\nMy mouth began to gape open in shock, and I turned to the next page. \n\n“*DAY 3*\n\n*I have successfully lured an adult into my trap. He is resting in the surgery. I plan to give him the Parasitic implant procedure shortly.  So long he stays in distress, he has no power over me.”*\n\nThe next page was empty. That last line had confirmed my suspicion: his weakness was calmness.\n\n*Is this guy an alien?*\n\nI was incredibly  stupefied after reading the  notebook. My mind was struggling to grasp the fact that this was somehow reality.  My mind was racing with questions.\n\n*What is “Parasitic implant surgery”?  Is that what was about to happen to me?*\n\n*Did his children, or should I say his victims, intentionally set me free? Do they have any humanity left?* \n\n*What do I do after this? Do I just leave and go on with my life?*\n\n*Will the police even believe such an absurd story?*\n\nI grabbed the notebook and left the room, being invisibly cautious of Zachorios whereabouts. I scanned each room as I went up them, breathing a sigh of relief each time  I didn't see him. After making it to the exit of the bunker, I breathed the biggest sigh of relief possible. Upon looking around, it was evident that it was nighttime, although it’s very unlikely it was the same night that i had arrived there.\n\nMy mind finally had some time to process the situation, and I collapsed onto my knees and broke down in tears. \n\nI felt hopeless; I didn't know who or where to go for help, and I also hadn’t a clue where Zachorio had gone off too.  After minutes of crying on the dirt floor,  I realized that it wouldn’t benefit me to do it for any longer. After getting on my feet I walked to my car and hopped in. I banged on the wheel and screamed in frustration when I remembered I didn't have my keys, and also didn’t have a clue where they were. \n\nI took a look around and a severe sense of isolation washed over me when the reality of my location set in. \n\nI figured my only option was walking until I found someone that would let me borrow their phone to call an uber, or walk until I found a taxi. The city's lights were ahead of me and I began to walk in their direction. I walked briskly, trying to focus on my surroundings and not the traumatic experience I had just undergone.  After around 20 minutes of walking, severe hunger began to kick in, making it even more likely it was not the same night it was when I had arrived at Zachorios bunker. \n\n*How long was I there? 1 day? 2 days…? …3 days?!*\n\nI groaned from the hunger pains, but continued walking.  After another half hour of walking, I had finally made it onto the city streets. Looking around, it was clear the night was still young; many people were driving and walking the streets, some with children, this made my chances of finding a taxi a lot easier.  I asked around a dozen people if I could borrow their phone, they all said no, and rightfully so. I know that if I were walking the streets of Los Angeles and someone asked to borrow my phone, I would automatically assume they have ill intent! \n\nFinally, after hours of roaming the streets, I saw a Taxi. After waving my hand up high, the taxi pulled over. \n\nAfter stepping into the vehicle and telling the driver the address, we were on our way. I stared out the window, staring at the city lights, pondering about the incident. \n\nAfter a while of driving, I had finally made it to my destination and ran into my house. I opened the fridge and stuffed my face with random foods, all of it tasting delicious to my famished stomach. After being done with stuffing my face, I called the police from my landline and explained the story to them in a more believable manner. I obviously didn’t include the parts about bullets ricocheting off of him and whatnot, just the main details. \n\nI sat down on my couch and opened up my laptop, and started typing this. I am totally and utterly traumatized from this incident, but I unfortunately suspect this will not be the end of Zachorio and I’s story… I will update if anything else happens.",

        "text": " I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, counting the minutes as they ticked by. I couldn't shake the feeling of restlessness that had been creeping over me all evening. I had tossed and turned for hours, but sleep seemed like a distant dream. I knew that if I didn't get some rest soon, the next day would be a struggle. But try as I might, my mind wouldn't shut off. It was as if something was calling to me, drawing me out of my bed and into the night.\n\nMy mind races with thoughts of work, relationships, and everything in between. It's another sleepless night, and I can't help but feel as though something is missing. I glance around my room, taking in the familiar surroundings. My dresser, my TV, my closet. It all seems so mundane, so uninspiring. I can't shake the feeling that I'm trapped in a rut. I glance at the clock, it's only 1:00 AM. I know I won't be able to fall asleep now, so I decide to take a walk.\n\nThe atmosphere outside was one of complete and utter emptiness. The moon was full, casting a pale light across the deserted streets. The only sound was the crunching of gravel beneath my feet as I walked. The darkness surrounds me like a thick blanket, suffocating and oppressive. The streetlights flicker above me, casting strange shadows on the pavement. The houses on either side of me are dark and empty, giving off an unsettling feeling. The air is thick with a damp mist that clings to my skin, making it feel clammy. I try to shake off the feeling of unease, but it clings to me like the mist. I have the sudden urge to turn back, but my restless mind won't let me. I begin to walk, my footsteps echoing in the empty streets. I can't help but feel like I'm the only one alive in this ghost town. The night seems to stretch on forever…\n\nAs I walked through the empty streets, I couldn't shake the feeling of unease. The darkness seemed to press in on me from all sides, and the silence was deafening. I tried to focus on the sound of my own footsteps, but even they seemed to echo unnaturally.\n\nAs I turned down a particularly dark alley, I couldn't help but notice the twisted shadows on the wall. They seemed to writhe and contort, as if they were alive. I quickened my pace, but the shadows seemed to follow me, their twisted forms growing ever more grotesque.\n\nI soon found myself in a rundown part of town, where the buildings seemed to lean in on me. The windows were boarded up, and the streets were littered with debris. I could hear strange noises coming from the shadows, but whenever I turned to look, there was nothing there.\n\nI felt like I was being watched, and my heart was pounding in my chest. I couldn't shake the feeling that something was following me. I knew I should have turned back, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. I had to keep walking, even as the darkness deepened and the creatures lurking in the shadows seemed to grow more and more ominous. \n\nThe darkness seemed to swallow everything in its path, leaving nothing but an empty void around me. I tried to focus on the sound of my footsteps, but they were drowned out by the eerie silence that hung in the air. Suddenly, I saw her. A long, tall woman with long black hair that covered her face. She was standing still, staring at me with an intensity that made my blood run cold. I couldn't help but feel that looking at her directly would only worsen my state of mind, so I kept my gaze fixed on the ground and quickened my pace. But no matter how fast I walked, I could feel her eyes following me, watching my every move. I knew that I had to get out of there, but something kept me from running. Fear had rooted me to the spot, and all I could do was continue my walk, trying to ignore the feeling of dread that was growing inside me.\n\nAs I continued my walk, the darkness seemed to deepen around me. The streets were empty, and the only sound was the soft echo of my footsteps. Suddenly, I caught a glimpse of something out of the corner of my eye. I turned to see a towering figure, at least eight feet tall, with deep red eyes that seemed to burn into my soul. Its skin was stitched together, and its mouth was stretched into a grotesque grin. I felt a chill run down my spine, but I forced myself to keep walking, trying to put as much distance between myself and the creature as I could. But the further I walked, the more the creature seemed to be following me. I could feel its presence looming behind me, always just out of sight. I knew I should be running, but my feet wouldn't move any faster. I couldn't shake the feeling that if I turned around, I would be trapped in its gaze forever.\n\nAs I trudged through the darkness, the mist began to roll in, enveloping me in a thick, eerie fog. The air was heavy and damp, and I could barely see more than a few feet in front of me. The only thing that kept me going was the sound of my own footsteps, the only thing that kept me company was the sound of the eerie silence. It was ironic, the same eerie silence I had dreaded so much was now my only company. I couldn't see anything, only the mist, and it was as if I was walking into an endless abyss. The sound of the silence was deafening, and I couldn't help but feel that something was watching me. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was not alone. The mist seemed to be alive, and it seemed to be closing in on me, as if it was trying to swallow me whole. The only thing that kept me going was the knowledge that I could not turn back, and so I walked on, into the unknown.\n\nAs I stumbled through the dark, eerie streets, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The mist that rolled in from the nearby lake seemed to cling to my skin, making me feel as though I was being suffocated. The sounds that surrounded me were equally unsettling—distant whispers, twisted laughter, and the soft shuffling of unseen feet.\n\nBut it was the children that truly sent chills down my spine. I saw them out of the corner of my eye, playing in a circle on the sidewalk ahead. Their faces were twisted and distorted, their eyes and mouths stretched in grotesque ways. I couldn't help but approach them, my curiosity getting the better of me.\n\n“What are you kids doing out so late?” I asked, trying to sound nonchalant. But as they turned to face me, I realized that their twisted features weren't just a trick of the light. These children were something otherworldly.\n\nThey began to circle me, their twisted faces inches from mine. I could feel their hot breath on my skin, could hear the low growls that emanated from their throats. And then, as one, they let out a blood-curdling scream.\n\nI fell to my knees, hands clapped over my ears, as the screams seemed to go on forever. I could feel my hearing slipping away, my mind shutting down in the face of such overwhelming terror. And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, it was over.\n\nI opened my eyes to find that daylight was creeping in, casting the once-haunting streets in a new light. I couldn't help but wonder what would have happened if I had stopped to question the other creatures I had seen on my night walk. But I knew deep down that I never wanted to find out.",

I fear the bottomless pit that death precedes.\n\nMy wife became sick in October, and there wasn’t enough money or medicine in the world to save her. We were simply enjoying what time we had left. However, about a week ago, my oldest friend proposed a sickening solution. Larry *always* has a solution, but it’s not often a good one. He told me about SoulSell. It’s a company that facilitates the conveyance of your soul’s title to the Devil.\n\n“Very funny,” I said.\n\n“I’m serious, Zane. You need help *right* now, and the guy downstairs can make anything happen,” Larry said.\n\n“I don’t think I could afford the Devil’s prices in this market,” I joked.\n\n“He doesn’t charge money,” Larry replied.\n\n“No? Then how would I repay the debt and reclaim my soul?” I asked. “What passes as currency in Hell?”\n\n“How the fuck should I know? This all came from the mouth of Tony,” Larry said, shrugging.\n\n“Well, I just Googled them,” I interjected. “Nothing about SoulSell online.”\n\nLarry facepalmed. “You’re so fucking dumb sometimes. Did you know that? They’re obviously not flaunting their services publicly. Are you even taking me seriously? I thought you believed in this shit.”\n\n“Of course I do,” I solemnly replied. “You *know* I do. I believe the Devil exists.”\n\n“Right, so what’s the big deal?” Larry asked.\n\nI shrugged. “Hope is a dangerous thing. I think I just have to accept the shitty hand I’ve been dealt.”\n\n“Fuck that. Look, let me text Tony for you. He’ll give you some details,” Larry said.\n\nBefore I could protest, Larry had messaged his friend, and I received a text from an anonymous number only a few minutes later. My friend nodded at my phone, which was sitting on the bar counter, and I begrudgingly picked it up. I hadn’t planned on doing anything rash, but things slipped away from me.\n\n*Hi, Zane. So sorry to hear about Natalie.* *I work for SoulSell. I don’t think Larry explained that part. I can tell you how this works. I’ll even put together a fair plan for you.*\n\n*Best,*\n\n*Anthony*\n\n*Thanks, Anthony. How much will this cost?*\n\n*In terms of money? Nothing. It’ll cost you everything else, though. It’s not a permanent transfer of ownership, but the road to reclaiming your soul isn’t an easy one. Do you believe in the Devil?*\n\n*I do, but I don’t know whether I believe in the validity of your service.*\n\n*You will. Are you on board?*\n\n*Well, Natalie doesn’t exactly have any other options, so I might as well give it a shot. What do I have to do?*\n\n*It’s already done, Zane. Have a good day.*\n\nI wasn’t sure what to make of such an ominous reply. I’ve never been a Christian or a Satanist, but I believe that there are things we don’t understand in this world. And that was certainly the case when Natalie and I visited the doctor two days later.\n\n“I’m not really sure how to explain this,” The doctor said. “As I told you a couple of months ago, your condition was untreatable. Incurable. But your recent scans show no trace of it. All I can assume is that we misdiagnosed you, Natalie. I’m so sorry.”\n\n“Sorry? Why are you apologising for giving me the best news of my life?” She laughed.\n\nNatalie jubilantly sobbed and tightly embraced me. Meanwhile, I was locking eyes with the incredulous doctor. I could only think of one explanation. A wave of fear flooded my body. What had I done? It was such a conflicting feeling. I was euphoric about my wife’s well-being but terrified of what it confirmed.\n\nThe Devil was real, and he owned my soul.\n\nSuddenly, the hospital was plunged into a world of silence. My tearful wife stiffened, as did the doctor sitting opposite us. I sharply inhaled, overcome by terror.\n\n“Hello, Zane.”\n\nThe wispy whisper billowed against the windowpane, so I rose to my feet. The sourceless voice was neither warm nor cold. Certainly not human. Looking out of the window, the entire world seemed to have stopped moving. Cars, birds, trees, and people. Everything was stuck in a ceaseless stasis. Everything but the sky.\n\nIt was noon, but the golden sun and dazzlingly-white clouds were starting to sour. This was not the arrival of night. It was something far darker than darkness.\n\nLucifer.\n\n“To pay your debt, balance must be restored,” The Devil whispered.\n\nA face started to form in the sky. Something unfit for the human gaze. The eyes were horrid holes. Inexplicably infinite. To stare into them was enough to evoke madness. To fall into them, I imagine, would be an eternal torture too horrifying to fathom.\n\n“Your first repayment will be a heart,” The Devil explained.\n\nThe doctor unfroze. Upon seeing that time had stopped, she screamed. And when she looked out of her window to see hellish black eyes in the sky, she unleashed a louder wail.\n\nIncessantly inhaling, to the point of fainting, the doctor started to claw at her neck, seemingly unable to exhale. I watched helplessly as she flailed around, bumping into her desk. Then, a series of cracking noises erupted from her torso. She cried breathlessly. Bone by bone, her ribcage was starting to snap.\n\nTerrified, I understood what was happening. The doctor keeled forwards, clutching the lump that was beginning to protrude from her chest. In a devilish display, her still-beating heart emerged through broken ribs, torn flesh, and a hole in her bloodied white shirt.\n\nThe doctor collapsed into the pool of her quickly-congealing blood. Though I wasn’t frozen in time, I could barely move. I could barely think. Words eventually slithered from my mouth.\n\n“How do I explain this scene?” I asked.\n\nAt that moment, the ceiling above the doctor caved inwards. I screamed as she was entombed in the avalanche of tiles and assorted medical equipment from the floor above. Both Natalie and I were unscathed, physically.\n\n“The next repayment will be costlier for you,” The Devil promised.\n\nBefore I had a chance to ask what the creature of Hell meant, the natural flow of time resumed. My wife screamed at the sight of the rubble atop her doctor. She was mostly perplexed as to how she hadn’t seen it tumble through the ceiling. I’m not even sure whether she also noticed that I had suddenly left my chair.\n\nThroughout this entire ordeal, which has truly traumatised Natalie, I haven’t been able to focus on anything. I haven’t been able to eat or sleep properly.\n\nI’m watching and waiting. Every time my wife slows her movements, I stifle a scream.\n\nI fear the next time-stop. I don’t want to know what else might constitute “repayment” in the Devil’s eyes. Will I ever fully pay off my mortgaged soul?\n\nWhat will he claim next?\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

        "text": "\n\n26/5/2023\nDear diary, \nI found this strange list of rules framed in a wooden box in my bedroom. I feel connected to it in many different ways, it feels too familiar to my brain, and I have been thinking about it ever since I read the letter. The letter read: \n\nDear reader, I am excited for you to finally read these list of rules for being my daughter/son. No matter what age you are in real life you will be 9 years old here, and you will age like normal here but you will not age in your reality. The rules for entering this reality are:\n\n1: You go to sleep thinking about how you will get a new family.\n\n2: You will not tell anyone about these rules or what your about to do.\n\n3: If you get a nightmare, you succeeded.\n\n4: You will wake up from the nightmare inside your new room.\n\nBe aware that if you are willing to enter all your problems will go away, if you have depression, anxiety or anything else it, it will all disappear while your here, if you survive until 18 in my house, all your problems will not disappear when your back to your reality. If you survive till your 21 all your problems will disappear in your reality. Keep in mind the fact that if your die at any point during your stay, you will die in your reality.\nNow for the people that will live in the house.\n\nMOTHER: Mother is a character that will not take disrespect, if you do not do everything she wants you to do, she will injure you are even kill you.\n\nBIG SISTER: Big sister will help you if mother is angry, but if you go into her room when she's not in it, she will snitch on you to mother, then she will not help you.\n\nTWIN SISTER: Her birthday is the 1st of December, DO NOT WISH HER HAPPY BIRTHDAY. \n\nFATHER (ME): There are no rules for me yet you will understand me later when your finally here.\n\nFAMILY DOG: The dog doesn't like you, don't try and be close to it.\n\nEventually me and mother will get into a argument, you will be age 13-15 if your any younger or older, kill yourself, your faith is way worse if you stay here. I hope that you decide to visit me for the 9-12 years you will be here. \n\nLOVE DADDY\n\nWhat the fuck is that list, should I try this, no I don't know. \nMaybe I should, my anxiety is way too strong to not do this, I'll give it a try....\nI'll probably try this at night.\n\n27/05/23 \nDear diary, \nI am about to try the thing the letter was talking about. I am in bed right now thinking about my new family while writing this, they will be so nice to me, I have not told anyone about these rules yet, I am hoping this will work, but I despise being scared.\n\n28/05/23 \nDear diary, \nI HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE LIST OF RULES AND I WAS THERE FOR 12 YEARS, I DIDNT HAVE ACCESS TO MY DIARY THERE BUT NO TIME HAS PASSED HERE. THE AMOUNT OF TIMES I HAVE ALMOST DIED FROM MY MOTHER GETTING ANGRY. I AM NOW OFFICIALLY FREE FROM MY ANXIETY AND MY ABUSIVE MOTHER, SHE IS NOW NOT ABUSIVE.",

        "text": "“So?” I asked, my voice shaking. “Is – is that good enough to let me live?”\n\nThe blonde woman looked at me like a was a science experiment. She cocked her head to one side and weighed my worth. I held my breath.\n\n[The gun barrel aimed at my jaw. It shook.](https://redd.it/10hqzk3)\n\nI wanted to believe that was a sign of hesitation, which meant hope.\n\nI tried to swallow, but my throat was too dry. I was so wired that each of my own heartbeats shook me. \n\nI wondered what getting shot would feel like. \n\nProbably like a concentrated baseball bat strike. I would feel my teeth knocked out. If your last moments are bitingly painful, do you reach toward unconsciousness, even though it means never patching up what was said during your last fight with a loved one?\n\nI focused on sitting still. For some reason, I believed that would help.\n\n“Okay.” Her word shook me; I’d been expecting a bullet, and the stimulus nearly knocked me out. “But I’m keeping the gun aimed at your head the whole time.” \n\nI let out a breath that I didn’t know I’d been holding. “Okay,” I answered, my voice trembling. “But – well – why didn’t you just shoot Santa?”\n\nHer shoulder fell. “You think I didn’t try?” She wiped a tear on her shirtsleeve. “He stood beyond the range that I could reach with my hands tied. The fucker knew exactly what he was doing.”\n\nI nodded slowly. “Your arms are free now, though.”\n\n“And I won’t hesitate to fire. I’m so sorry – I hope you know that.”\n\nI began to stand up.\n\n“But not sorry enough to spare you, if that’s what it comes to,” she answered.\n\nWe gazed at one another. I knew then that we each wanted to cry, but were both so far beyond shattered that we lacked the capacity for such an escape. \n\nI broke eye contact and leaned forward, pushing Jerry’s charred corpse off of my lap. Have you ever tasted French onion soup that was just too hot? The gooey surface stretches across everything it touches, burning any exposed skin with its scalding touch. Jerry was like that; his burnt skin parted from his body like a rich mixture of Swiss gruyere and mozzarella, clinging to my hands and thighs as it sloughed off. The slightest touch scalded my skin, adhering to it like rubber cement. The exposed flesh beneath was the smeared red paste of hot marinara, spattering across every available surface before what remained of his corpse pitched backward. The rest of his body smacked against the floor, dissolving into an amorphous blob now that his skin no longer enclosed the meat sack. \n\nHe smelled like a pungent mixture of HoneyBaked Ham and the terrified excavation of bowels that had been liberated by fear and fire.\n\n“This is your last chance.”\n\nI snapped my attention upward and stared at the blonde woman with the gun. “What?”\n\n“I’ve told you three times to cut yourself loose and stand. I won’t say it a fourth.”\n\n“Sorry!” I stammered, reaching around in panic. “Sorry, I was lost in my thoughts and didn’t hear you – I – the knife is just under the seat, right? Should I use that? Of course. Hang on, let me reach for it – just give me a second, please – that’s okay, right? Okay, I’m doing it now, please don’t shoot – I’ve got it in my hand, now I’m cutting one string away – now here’s the other one-”\n\n“I don’t need you to narrate your life,” she snapped. “Just finish and stand.”\n\n“I’m sorry, I blabber when I get nervous, and the gun you’re pointing at my stomach makes me very-”\n\n“Shut up. Stand.”\n\nI pushed the cut ropes away and got shakily to my feet.\n\nShe nodded.\n\nThat was the moment that everything got real. When you’re trying to survive the next few seconds, your mind can shut everything else off. But the promises I made felt very different now that I had to pay them in full.\n\n“Wait,” I stammered. My voice felt like a brittle leaf. “We still haven’t done it yet. It’s not to late.”\n\nShe looked at me with icy blue bombardier’s eyes and shook her head.\n\nI knew then that there was no turning back.\n\nMy breath hitched once, but I had no capacity to cry. I realized that I never would again, that some part of me had forever been left behind in that chair. \n\nOne step at a time, I stalked over to the man in the black suit, the man who had cut off his finger with garden shears. My shoes make a *squish squish* sound in the shallow pool of charcoal blood that Jerry had left on the floor.\n\nI stared at the man, who was both blurry and shockingly clear all at once. He looked like a mannequin; his body was white and still. A stream of viscous blood dripped in a steady waterfall from his severed finger, and a wide pool of the liquid lay beneath his chair. My heart leapt at the idea that he might be dead already.\n\nThen his glassy eyes rolled toward me. He tried to speak, but his voice was almost too raspy to hear. \n\nHe smiled. “We survived. Thanks for coming to cut me loose, man.”\n\nI wanted to cry. I wanted to break. But there was nothing in me whole enough to provide such a release. \n\nHe saw it in my expression.\n\n“No, man, just – hey, there’s no reason to hurt me, just walk away if you – wait – wait – wait, please wait-” He pressed his neck against his chest so that I couldn’t reach his throat. “Please, not now,” he whispered. “All of this made me realize why I want to live, I need to tell my sister I’m sorry – please, I just have to live long enough – wait, I-”\n\nNausea rose in my throat as I finally got the exacto knife into the side of his neck. He flinched, exposing, more neck, and I hit him again. I couldn’t help suppress the thought that *this is so easy*, that human skin offers so little resistance to knives that it’s a wonder we don’t kill each other more often.\n\nIt’s fucked up. But I couldn’t stop; I could only marvel at just *how* fucked up it all really is. \n\nMovies portray deaths, even gruesome ones, as somewhat glorious. But this was just messy. Once I couldn’t bear the thought of stabbing him anymore, I stepped back to watch his final minutes. \n\nThere was no dignity. He convulsed, pissed his pants, and stared at me with deep frustration and soft confusion. I was grateful on his behalf when it ended.\n\nI dropped the exacto knife onto the floor. Blood muffled the sound.\n\n“And there you have it,” I said to the blonde woman behind me. I could feel her gun pointed at the back of my skull. “Now we both have unspeakable secrets to hold over one another.” I wiped my face, inadvertently smearing the man’s blood across my lips. “Is that enough to let me live?”\n\n----------------\n\nNow you see why the Valium’s not sufficient.\n\nThe bleach blocked a few hours of memory, but unfortunately, I still woke up. I’m going to mix it with ammonia in hopes that the mixture will be potent enough to erase awareness of what I am.\n\nIf it doesn’t work, I’ll finish telling about my experience. \n\n----------------\n\n [FB](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/)\n\n[BD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/)\n\n\n\n[W](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcn_pa1QfNMRzbTuJqXSoRQ)\n\n[E](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/)",

        "text": "Hey guys I know it’s been a while since I updated this story. A lot has happened. I wanted to come back and talk about a lot of past hauntings, but the last couple weeks have been too weird not to talk about. What I wanna tell you guys about now is the teddy bear.\n\nAlright so basically all recreational stuff for employees is downstairs in the basement. That being said, the employee bathroom is also downstairs. Most of peoples’ experiences of the paranormal in this store take place in the bathroom, actually. The most recent has left us all totally disturbed and in the middle of a police investigation. Let me explain.\n\nSo one day, as I was heading into one of the stalls after a particularly large coffee to wake me up that morning, I found a teddy bear. Just sitting on the closed toilet. I don’t know why I jumped slightly, but it just wasn’t something I expected to be there. I thought it might’ve been a coworker messing around but I’ve seen too many horror movies to write it off right away. So I kicked the bear onto the ground and pushed it into the next stall over so I could do my business as usual.\n\nI had a pretty normal day of customer service and pulling freight, just minding my own business, when I got a text from my buddy and coworker, Wade. “You have GOT to come see this…” Great. What now? I was thinking as I made my way to the break room. \n\nEveryone was gathered in the bathroom looking at the teddy bear in the stall, sitting on the toilet exactly as I had found it earlier. This time it was a little bit more menacing though, as now it had its mouth open. At least, it had its little stuffed teddy bear approximation of a mouth open. Inside was one small tooth, just sitting in its bottom jaw on the left hand side. It looked like it was kinda shoved in. Looked like a baby tooth.\n\nWe were all understandably very unsettled by this and everyone had their turn around the room swearing up and down that it wasn’t them. Mark suggested calling the police and Eric just kinda looked at him like he was crazy. “It’s obviously just someone messing around, it’s just a baby tooth” he said. “Plenty of people have kids here.”\n\nBefore anyone could argue how crazy that sounded, however, the bear was gone, just like that. Wade called out first before anyone else noticed “FUCK GUYS LOOK” and we all turned around to see a completely empty stall. We checked every adjacent stall and they were all equally vacant. Weird and bad. So we dipped out of there, all with similar looks of horror on our faces and tried to forget what happened. But Wade was so freaked out that he went home early that day. \n\nTwo weeks passed without incident and we kind of forgot about it. “Yeah haha terrifying bear in the stall gag, classic.” And it was fine. But then all of a sudden it very much was not fine again. The teddy showed up again in the following days and this time it had three more teeth in its mouth, which would’ve been surprising, had I not suspected this might happen since the second time it showed up.\n\nObviously this time we called the police. And mind you this is like the 11-hundredth time the police have been called to this place since it was built so they were expecting something a little off. But the crooked baby teeth protruding out of the mouth of this bear in a semi-smile was enough to scare the poor new officer that they sent us. It was probably some kind of hazing to be sent here.\n\nAnyway, long story short, they did a DNA analysis on the bear’s teeth and found out that they each belonged to separate individuals, all kids who had gone missing in and around the area within a 30 mile radius in the last 10 years, give or take. We heard the news while we were all at work. Wade threw up when we found out and ended up quitting within the week, and Eric just kind of had a funny look on his face for a while after. You could tell this time the weird shit hit a little too hard.\n\nCut to another week later. My nerves have absolutely not calmed down and every time I had to use the bathroom I would peek under the stalls just to make sure there was no psycho killer waiting for me to be unfortunate enough to enter the wrong door. And needless to say I was not accepting overnight shifts.\n\nIt was Saturday when the final incident with this bear occurred. I remember that because the rest of the guys were off that day and I was hanging out in the break room alone. It was waaayyyy too quiet so I decided to put in my headphones and try to drown out the silence.\n\nAs I was grabbing them out of my pocket, though, I heard a faint sound coming from the bathroom door. It almost sounded like chattering, like tap-tapping at a rapid speed. I just looked up at the sky and prayed to god I wasn’t about to see this bear again with more teeth in its grotesque mouth.\n\nI headed towards the door and opened it slowly. As soon as I got it all the way open the chattering abruptly stopped. I froze in fear and let out a vaguely whimpering “hello?” No response. I walked over to the same stall the teddy had been in before and instantly dropped on my ass, losing my footing and hitting the ground hard as I opened the stall door.\n\nThe door swung back and hit the latch, bouncing away one more time, allowing me another horrible view of the bear that sat on the toilet in front of me. It’s entire head was now replaced with a completely human skull, the empty eye sockets staring forward and down at me with malice. The skull looked adolescent, and I knew it had to be another missing child. But it looked old and dirty, like it had been in the ground for years.\n\nI called the police again frantically and thankfully they arrived fast. I bolted out of there, having been sat on my ass staring forward at the stall door for what felt like forever. I stayed to give my statement to the cops but I hopped in my car as soon as I could, getting home and locking all the doors and windows. The boss gave me a few days PTO after that.\n\nWhen I finally got back to work Mark gave me the whole story. Allegedly the police told the store manager, who then told some other people and it eventually made its way back to Mark, that the skull found on the bear was old. Like the DNA matched it up to an old cold case file of a missing child from the 70’s kind of old. As in the child went missing from the Blue Canyon hotel when it was still operational and was never found. Until now.\n\nHis name was Jonathan Kinder, and there was no one to tell of his discovery, because his only surviving parent, his mother, had committed suicide after the police had declared him most likely dead back in the early 80’s.\n\nI’m going to end this here again. I’m super tired tonight and I just want to forget everything by staring into the back of my eyelids. So, until I have some other crazy stuff to update you guys on, sayonara.",
