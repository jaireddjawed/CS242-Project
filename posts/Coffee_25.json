        "text": "I have just recently started to get into coffee, and for my first purchase I bought an Aeropress and a bag of Starbucks Verdana Blend pre-ground coffee. I know this is not generally recommended but at the time I didn’t want to invest in a hand grinder and just wanted to dip my toes in. For the first first couple of days I was enjoying my coffee but after awhile I started to notice a pretty strong acidic/sour flavor in my coffee. I tried various things with my Aeropress to try and resolve the issue, (brewing longer, using the inverted method, changing water temperate) but the unpleasant flavor remained. As I’m so new to all this I can’t really figure out what caused this. Is this just how this particular blend of coffee tastes, or is it an issue with pre-ground coffee in general, my brewing method, my palate or something else entirely? Thank you for any and all advice you give to help resolve my issue.",

        "text": "As much as I love coffee, I have been wanting off the sauce for a while now. I recently had a health motivation to do so and so have been exploring alternatives. I appreciate these new-fangled light and blonde roasts for showcasing fruitiness of certain varieties, but I’ve always preferred a well balanced dark as can be cup, roasty with limited acidity. I’ve kept barley tea around the house for years but just had the thought to brew it strong through the Aeropress, and am very happy with the results. I’m looking for some suggestions on how to fill out the mid palate fullness that fill out a nice cup of coffee. I would plan on blending something in to the roasted barley from the teabag and keep using the aeropress. Or maybe a French press to get some more volume. \n\nI see some current alternatives use chicory root, I’m not sure what character that brings to the mix?\n\nI suspect there is overlap in this sub with r/homebrewing, which is where I am coming at this from. The color of the barley in the tea bag looks more like a dark chocolate Lovibond range rather than roast. I am thinking pale chocolate, or maybe even some sort of base malt (Munich?) to provide some breadiness that might be what I’m looking for.\n\nThanks for any insight, sorry for being a quitter.",

I can't really tell by the color of the beans what the roast is since a *good* dark roast isn't going to be the nearly black color of a grocery store or Starbucks dark roast. Furthering the problem is that I haven't quite learned to tell the difference between sour and bitter, nor can my fiancee. So this makes it difficult to dial in the right grind and water temperature. I bought an 8 oz bag off coffee the other day and I've almost gone through all of it just trying to make it taste good. \n\nWhy do roasters not list the roast? With all the information listed on the bag like origin, process, flavor notes, roast date, etc etc etc, why is light/medium/dark roast not listed? And am I just blind for not being able to tell by sight?",

The next morning comes and well, everything is going swimmingly so far.\n\nThen your person rolls over, looks into your eyes and says, \"babe, I'd love a coffee right now.\" How romantic, they think, that you'll bring them a coffee to bed. Well, little do they know...  \nThe realisation hits you. Oh sh\\*t, you only have instant coffee in your cupboard. The really bad kind that's been sitting there for years.\n\nWhat do you do? Well you only have a few options: 1) make the terrible instant coffee or 2) walk 15 minutes in the cold to your local cafe only to probably drop it on the way back (you're hungover, let's be realistic).\n\nYou decide to go for Option 1. Screw the cold. You boil water, pour it over the clumpy granules and stir it together. It doesn't look great.\n\nYou sheepishly bring the mug of coffee to your person wondering if you'll get away with it.\n\nThey take a sip.\n\nSilence.\n\n\"What kind of coffee is this?\", they ask.\n\nYou confess it's instant.\n\nThey look you in the eyes, pause, and say \"I don't think this is going to work.\"\n\nThey put the mug down, get out of bed, get dressed and leave.\n\nYou never hear from them again.\n\nMoral of the story?

Its hard to make a bad cup, 200ml is perfect for me and it gets me away from my desk when I work from home.\n\nThat being said, is something like a Sage Precision Brewer the right machine for what I'm drinking now?

Currently I am doing my coffee with Hario V60, Timemore chestnut C2 hand grinder and Timemore black mirror nano scale, but I am thinking of buying myself an espresso machine (for almost a year I am reading reviews on machines and grinders) because I also love a good espresso or sometimes some cortado, cappuccino etc. so I would also want a machine with good steaming wand. Now to my question:\n\nIs it a good idea to buy Rancilio Silvia and DF64 as a starting gear for a guy, who never made an espresso (not counting our office automatic espresso machine which does okayish cappucinos)? Or should I buy something cheaper for the start? Should I go for second-hand or if I am not-so technically well equipped should I just buy a brand new?\n\nI am planning to make espresso usually from omni-roast to light-roast from local roasters (CZ).\n\nThank you for your responses!",

Now, I laugh at my old self. \n\nNowadays I still go for nice coffee, but don't always get the expensive beans from the most hip 3rd wave roasters.  Sometimes Costco will do.  Each morning I boil some water and make use of the $5 Melitta or french press or whatever, make myself a nice cup of joe and get on with my day.

        "text": "Whenever I watched some grinder review on YouTube I wondered, whether normal people like me would taste a difference. Now I got the chance to try it for myself, I bought a Mignon Single Dose when it came out and recently my brother bought a Niche Zero and let me compare them for a while :-) \n\nThe answer is yes, we tasted quite a difference. We tried three espressos brewed with a Profitec Pro 300: a lightly roasted, funky, heavily fermented coffee from Columbia, a lightly roasted, spicy, natural coffee from Ethopia, and a dark roast, natural coffee from Brazil. With all three coffees the roasty, nutty, chocolaty notes were stronger with the Niche. With the light roasts, the spicy and fruity notes were clearer with the Mignon and we preferred that, but depending on your taste you might prefer the less acidic Niche espresso over the added complexity, particularly with the funky one. For the dark roast, however, we felt one day we tasted more flavors with the Mignon and the other with the Niche, so no conclusive answer there, beyond the roasty flavors.\n\nRegarding the handling, the only big difference I noticed was the seasoning of the burrs: With the Mignon it took quite a few bags of coffee, until we got reproducible espresso without channeling. Channeling was never an issue with the Niche, but the first bag of coffee had a harsh bitterness, that I remembered from new Commandantes. Otherwise it's potato potato, both are easy to dial in and use in general. With the Mignon you have to be a bit careful to not knock off the rubbery thing and with the Niche to not throw the coffee beans everywhere.\n\nI am fine with both designs, the Niche might be a bit smaller and quieter. The Mignon has these weird holes in the front, because they just mounted the standard case at an angle, and the Niche has this irritating LED, showing you when it's plugged in 🤷\n\nTLDR; Even normies taste a difference; if you like ashtray coffee go for the Niche, if you like sour hounds go for the Mignon :-)",

Should I begin with Barista Hustle's guide? \n\n- If so, my concern is that they only use two ingredients (Epsom salt and baking soda), and I'm worried I'll be missing key ingredients I've heard others discuss (potassium, calcium)\n- also if so, anyone have a suggestion for which recipe is a good starting point for helping with clarity/sweetness/vibrancy of light roasts?\n\nB.) OR, should I try Lotus Coffee Water drops?\n- My main concerns here are whether it's very expensive (hard for me to judge) and if it will lead me to too many variables? Though, it does seem like a very simple set of variables with the droplet approach. \n\nAny guidance at all would be extremely helpful! Thanks so much",

        "text": "Had the weirdest experience in this morning’s cup of coffee. It tasted like beef soup. No joke. It had a very clear beef/salty/savory flavor. It’s been an hour since my last sip and rubbing my tongue through my mouth I can still pick up beef flavor. It’s like I just ate some beef jerky and the residual taste is still in my mouth. \n\nI brewed it my default way using fresh ground Dunkin original beans that I have been using for about a week now(don’t hate, just wanted to try them). They have been surprisingly great so far, nice flavor and a bit of acidity, but I’ve never gotten this out of them. My default go-to is an inverted Aeropress, 18g coffee(ground @ setting 3 on my encore), 90gram water, stir and wait 1:30 then press over ice and top with an equal amount of unsweetened plain almond milk. Basically an iced flat white. \n\nJust the weirdest thing. Tastes straight up like beef soup. how? why? Has anyone else gotten this flavor before.",
