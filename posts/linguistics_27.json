        "text": "I'm not sure if this is a linguistic question or maybe a psychology question, so let me know if this is the wrong place. When you're having a conversation with somebody and there's a long pause, there's usually some point where you can tell someone's going to talk, even without necessarily seeing the person. Another way of formulating that might be that after a long pause in a conversation, people will start trying to talk at exactly the same time.\n\nOne of the things that specifically makes me think of this (and I think is the same concept, but correct me if I'm wrong) is a team-building/theatre game I've done a few times, where a group circles up, closes their eyes, and tries to count to 20 (or whatever number), popcorn-style (nobody can say more than one number in a row). If two people talk at the same time, you have to start back at the beginning. It's something that, on its surface, seems like it should be pretty easy, but whether people try to say the next number immediately or try to wait a really long time, two people will almost always try to talk at the same time.\n\nWhy does this happen? It's something that tends to be pretty consistently predictable, but obviously not something that either person is explicitly trying to measure or time. I'm not super well-read in linguistics, but I know that turn-taking is definitely a subject I've seen a lot in passing, and I'm guessing this is very related to that, but I'm not sure where to go looking for information on this.",

It was an IT oriented \"sixth form / UK college\" thingy so people from different cities came to that school since stuff like that isn't available in every city. This is not an issue though since cities are right next to each other in this region and sometimes transition fluently into each other. So we're not talking about a distance like LA and NYC but more like 10 minutes by regional public transport. \n\nAnyway, some of those students with Turkish origins were from Neuss, some of them were from Düsseldorf. \n\nThe two I remember the clearest (been a few years) were not from the same city. I always thought that the one from Neuss always had a weird speech pattern. Not because of his foreign roots (all spoke Turkish at home, by the way, so I wouldn't be surprised if they spoke with a Turkish accent) but just in general. It was also distinctly different from the speech of other people of Turkish origin my age that I know. I just thought he spoke weirdly. He was a weird dude in general. Not in a bad way. He sounded very differently compared to the Düsseldorfer guy. \n\nAnyway, fast forward a whole university degree and a bit and I'm working pretty much on the border of Düsseldorf and Neuss and a company party is held in Neuss. On m way home, I walk to the train station and it's a good 15 minutes walk on a Friday so a lot of people around chatting and drinking and I walked past 2 or 3 groups of people who all spoke like him including Turkish words in German sentences (not just any words but exactly in the same way he used to do it) and speech pattern and all of that stuff. If you'd just let me listen to the voices I'd have sworn it was him. But I've never heard that way of speaking after I left that school in my home city or another city I used to live in. \n\n**So, my questions are**: is there some more information on this phenomenon (different dialects of communities of immigrants in (maybe even German) cities)? What would you call that? Is it a sociolect?",

        "text": "Hello linguists and language scholars! I stumbled across something recently that got me thinking. There is a constructed language called [Folksprak](https://folksprak.org/wiki/doku.php) that attempts to be intelligible to all speakers of any Germanic language with pretty much no training. Basically, they take cognates from various languages and morph them to remove any obvious markers from any one particular language. The idea is that this creates a sort of primordial Germanic soup that we can all learn quickly and easily.\n\nThe sentence that the Folksprak website uses as an example is **\"Ek hav skrivt en buk.\"** And just looking at it, as a native English speaker, some problems come up right away. For one, this sentence is no more intelligible to me than any natural Germanic language. I might as well just learn Dutch or Swedish, just to pick two examples. And for two, everyone already uses English for this exact purpose. So my questions to you guys are\n\n1. Is Folksprak actually more intelligible to a Dane or a Swede than, say, Dutch or Icelandic?\n\n2. Are there any examples of conlangs like this that people are actually using? Do people find them useful for practical purposes?\n\nLonger Folksprak example text:\n\n&gt; Ek bid fur fargiving, dog ek vil nit are de verlds herskar — ek ar nit solk en man. Ek vil nit beherske er neddrüke et man, insted ek vil helpe de maner alvan on alvar: De judisk, de hejdisk, de farvig, de vit, …. Vi al skal helpe en de ander fur at vi kan leve inan en beter verld.

But the thing is, I'm not really sure how to go about getting one, if I already don't have one. I grew up near the Appalachian region (south) and I've been told conflicting things about how I speak throughout my life. When I was younger, people said I had a very strong accent, but as I got older people seemed to have said the reverse. And I've been trying to independently figure out how I speak, but from my understanding of IPA symbols and whatnot many of the transcriptions for Southern American accent don't seem accurate to how I actually speak, e.g. I have no pin-pen merger, I have the cot-caught merger, I don't drop r's at the ends of my words, etc. And when viewing/hearing other dialects of American English, I rarely hear anything that sounds too distinct from how I normally pronounce words. The only thing I can definitely note is how I pronounce /ai/ in a word like nine, often times it doesn't sound like a diphthong. And the word 'rural' as well is quite odd; the way I pronounce it kind of sounds like 'rrrrrrrrual'. Oddly though, I also was told recently I 'sound' ethnic; two people in a conversation related to this subject said I sounded Asian-American or that I was speaking AAVE, which I'm neither of those nor a minority. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd on a side note, at least for the Southern American English wikipedia pages, it seems descriptive mostly of how older (50+) people speak, but definitely not how &lt;30 somethings speak (at least in urban areas)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's a recording of me reading the first few of the Rainbow Passage: [https://www.speakpipe.com/voice-recorder/msg/abt0tcutyr66a1g8](https://www.speakpipe.com/voice-recorder/msg/abt0tcutyr66a1g8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA longer recording if anyone can stomach it: [https://www.speakpipe.com/voice-recorder/msg/0g6xqcnw7ntxnh28](https://www.speakpipe.com/voice-recorder/msg/0g6xqcnw7ntxnh28)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for any responses",

If a \"mistake\" is popular among native speakers, then it's not a mistake but part of the evolution of the language. I imagine at some point, the official grammar will be too different from spoken language that it will have to be updated. But I'm wondering if this has already happened before with any other languages.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/9gwk8v/timetravel_narratives_that_attempt_to_deal_with/",
        "text": "Reddit, do you know any other time-travel narratives (any form of media!) where a time traveler must explicitly deal with (presumably struggle with) language change? I suppose what I'm really after is where the language still resembles the time traveler's in some way; either they must learn obsolete forms of the language they know in the past or new forms in the future. Maybe this is just far more interesting as a thought experiment than as part of an actual narrative, which is why it's so rare, but I'm curious if examples exist. Counterexamples below. My apologies if this isn't r/linguistics appropriate, but historical linguistics is the underlying theme here so it felt right.\n\nI've recently been replaying Chrono Trigger (for the SNES, released 1995) and was struck by a particular hollowness of the portion of the game where the characters travel from 1000 AD to 65,000,000 BC and find prehistoric people. The people speak, at least in both English translations (the original 1995 translation and one from 2008), in the stereotypical broken English of cave people, e.g. \"Ayla fight while alive! Win and live. Lose and die. Rule of life. No change rule.\"\n\nThe characters from different time periods have no problems understanding each other and the narrative proceeds from there. It gets a little messy later on when the character Ayla *explicitly teaches* the characters from the far future morphemes from her language (\"Ayla's word! 'La' mean fire. 'Vos' mean big\"), raising the question of who is speaking what language from when and how.\n\nThe original translation of the game also features a character from 600 A.D. (Frog) who speaks in pseudo-Early Modern English, with heavy doses of thous, thines and -eths. None of the other characters from that era do the same. Thankfully the re-translation from last decade drops that; instead the characters from 600 A.D. as a whole speak with subtly archaic diction, which is a great improvement. The characters do in fact also travel to 2300 A.D where there is no demonstrable change in how people speak (aside from robots who are hypereloquent). \n\nIt's interesting because the game makes vague gestures towards language change but otherwise glosses over it. Which is fine! I don't mean to be pedantic, of course. It's more important for the narrative to proceed than for it to get bogged down in, say, characters born millions of years apart realistically having no way to understand each other. But it *did* make me wonder if there are time-travel narratives that deal with language change explicitly.\n\nThe other narrative that comes to mind is, naturally, The Time Machine by H.G. Wells. The Eloi people the Time Traveler encounters clearly have their own language that is initially completely impenetrable to him as an English speaker. He learns their language but it is never represented to the reader. He also learns that they do not have a writing system, which Wells uses as evidence of their intellectual decay, not as any particularly profound linguistic statement. So all in all not a huge amount to work with there.\n\nThanks in advance, all.",

While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate disscussion all of the time, here are some examples: \n\n*Quick questions:*\n\n* Asking for an explanation of a technical term\n* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature\n* Asking how we would transcribe something\n* Asking how a feature works in a particular language\n\n*Not-so-quick questions:*\n\n* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim\n* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject\n\nIf you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.\n\nAlso, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first.

        "text": "One way in which Latin forms its adverbial clauses is by using participles, for instance in this example from Wikipedia:\n\n*oculus sē nōn* *vidēns*, *alia cernit*\n\neye(m.sg.nom)  itself not seeing(m.sg.nom), other.things descerns\n\n\"Although it cannot see itself, the eye descerns other things.\"\n\nThe important thing is that the verb in the adverbial clause (or at least what is an adverbial clause in its English translation) \"se non videns\" is a participle that agrees in gender, number and case with its subject, which in this case is the subject of the matrix clause, and hence in the nominative. (I know that there is also the Ablativus Absolutus construction, which also uses the participle, but for now that is not what I am interested in.) So the features of this construction are:\n\n1. It is used in cases where in English you would often use an adverbial clause\n2. It uses a participle, in other words, a non finite verb that is also used in attributive clauses\n3. it shows agreement in gender, number and case with its subject, where the case is determined by what grammatical role the subject of the adverbial clause has in the matrix clause. In our example the subject is also the subject in the matrix clause and therefore the case of the participle is nominative.\n\nI know that this is one of the ways adverbial clauses are formed in Greek as well, and I believe also in Sanskrit, but are there any cases of this type of construction outside Indo-European languages? I do know that there are a lot of languages that have specialized forms for adverbial phrases like for instance the Mongolian converbs, or closer to home the Romance gerunds, and some of these (like the so-called participial in Zulu) agree with their subject, but I haven't found a language outside Indo-European where you use the participle, that is a non-finite verb used in attributive clauses, for adverbial clauses.  I am most interested in the agreement with case, because in these constructions the case of the participle is not dependent on its role in the clause, but rather of the role of its subject in the matrix clause.",

I've been semi-actively learning it for a few months from those friends, who lived in England at the time, and they taught me all sorts of cases where you can sort of swallow letters in casual speech and still have it sound natural (e.g. cutting 's' off the end of words, reducing '-ado' to 'ao') and also about how words ending/starting in vowels sort of flow into each other (so 'me acuerdas' comes out something like 'myacuerdas' or 'macuerdas'). \n\nObviously Spanish is not the same as Latin by a long chalk, but the conjugation and grammar is fundamentally similar, and I (maybe wrongly) assume the phonology isn't too far off either.
