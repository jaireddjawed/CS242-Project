        "text": " I love this George Monbiot piece on animal farming and what it has done to our world - and how astonishingly revolutionary the answer could be.\n\n[https://youtu.be/6eaTIe\\_TBZA](https://youtu.be/6eaTIe_TBZA)\n\nThis is absolutely fascinating news - and I'm very excited by the potential. \n\nBut I'm having trouble measuring the potential for regrowing forests and carbon sequestration. I once calculated that if this happened and freed up the grazing lands which are 26% of the ice-free land on earth, we could regrow enough trees to eventually solve climate change outright. OK. But my challenge now is how do we know that, given so much of the land is already grasslands that were probably (more or less) being grazed by wild buffalo and antelope etc *before* we industrialised the planet? That is, according to Our World in Data - 10,000 years ago 57% of the ice-free land was forests, 42% grasslands.\n\nAnyone know how to measure how much deforestation has occurred in the name of livestock in the last 300 years - and how much forest we could regrow if we simply *didn't need livestock?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTony Seba runs some broad American numbers - but does anyone happen to have research on the global picture and what could be reforested and even aforested - given the right climate and rainfall? Because freeing up land from grazing doesn't do the same thing if that land was already pastureland.\n\nTony Seba:\n\n \n\n* **By 2035, 60% of the land currently used for livestock and feed production will be freed for other uses. This 485 million acres equates to 13 times the size of Iowa, an area almost the size of the Louisiana Purchase.**\n* **If all this freed land were dedicated to reforestation and efforts were made to utilize tree species and planting techniques intended to maximize carbon sequestration, all current sources of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions could be fully offset by 2035.**\n* **U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from cattle will drop by 60% by 2030, on course to nearly 80% by 2035. Even when the modern food production that replaces animal agriculture is included, net emissions from the sector as a whole will decline by 45% by 2030, on course to 65% by 2035.**\n* **Water consumption in cattle production and associated feed cropland irrigation will fall by 50% by 2030, on course to 75% by 2035. Even when the modern food production that replaces animal agriculture is included, net water consumption in the sector as a whole will decline by 35% by 2030, on course to 60% by 2035.**\n* [https://www.rethinkx.com/food-and-agriculture-executive-summary](https://www.rethinkx.com/food-and-agriculture-executive-summary)",

To get this job, I would need to relocate for the summer, put on hold my current minimum wage job where I live. A bit of trouble to get the position, so I'm wondering if it's worth it... Is it ok if I ask for minimum $19/h in my cover letter? I'm paid $17/h on my current job and I'm looking to get professional experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you",
