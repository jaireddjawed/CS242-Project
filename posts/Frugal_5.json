Or maybe it seemed perfect at first but after you used it a bit you just weren't feeling it?\n\nI never used to return things, at all, period. Then I realized how much this was costing me, when the return windows are there for a reason and should be employed if I'm not satisfied with my purchases. Amazon returns, in particular, are incredibly easy to do.\n\nI've started setting due dates in Todoist a few days before any purchase's return window closes so that I am invited to really consider if the item has met expectations or if I would rather not keep it: https://imgur.com/WHagOrS   This has led me to be much happier long-term with anything I own, since after a few weeks of using something I'm a lot more able to determine if it meets my needs or not. Checking in with each item like this has saved me from accumulating things I don't need but hadn't thought to return in time.  If you use an app like Todoist or Microsoft To Do you can even attach PDFs of receipts, warranties, etc. (I keep a Google Sheets document of all my warranty dates and instructions, which I also recommend doing!)\n\nI highly recommend doing something similar so you can make sure that you're happy with your purchases before your window to return them is up!",

        "text": "Recently, I bought a brand new hoodie for $40. I was excited to wear it and thought it would be a great addition to my wardrobe. However, within weeks, the fabric started pilling at the sleeves. I was disappointed and frustrated that the quality didn't live up to the price.\n\nBut instead of just accepting it and letting my money go to waste, I decided to return the hoodie. I didn't want to settle for a subpar product, and I wanted the company to know that their product was insufficient. Plus, I didn't want to contribute to waste by keeping a hoodie that I wasn't happy with.\n\nReturning an item that doesn't meet our standards is not only a frugal choice, but it's also a way to hold companies accountable for their products. By returning it, we're sending a signal that we expect better, and that we won't settle for anything less.\n\nOf course, this advice only applies to items that have a good return policy and are within the return period. But many stores do offer generous return policies, and taking advantage of them is a smart move.\n\nSo, next time you're tempted to keep a product that you're not happy with, remember that returning it is a frugal choice. You deserve products that meet your standards, and companies deserve to hear our feedback when they don't deliver. Let's not settle for anything less!",

It sounds gross but I kind of like it over actual cereal now. You have to eat it fast because it gets soggy quick. Now that I’m on my own now to cut back on money instead of buying cereal for $4 I buy graham crackers for $2",

I've lived in semi-rural US for my whole life, ergo a car was a necessity. $250/mo for the best insurance, ~$140/week for gas, ~500/yr for oil changes, etc. ~$400/mo!!! Just got a bill for $500 for random crap needing replacement, I'm tired of throwing money away and I detest driving with all my being. \n\nI'm (hopefully) going to be moving to a university city for my PhD. I'll be living off-campus and therefore will not be right on campus or eating crappy campus food. So, I have a few questions for those who have successfully ditched a car in the US (better if you're in Florida/UF).\n\n- Groceries? - Ok, so I've looked into Kroger grocery deliver, $65/year no tipping required, so really good price, might even lower my bill by decreasing impulse purchases. Any other ideas or suggestions?\n\n- Bus? Moped? Trying to find an affordable place near a bus route, but also considering a moped since they don't need insurance under a certain power level. Obviously will rent a car for longer trips/vacations and it's cheaper with a university discount. \n\n- Other considerations? Like I said, I've been born into the idea of a car being a necessity, so there may be MANY others things I'm not even thinking of.",

I’ll buy it if I need to buy does anyone else have any ideas about how to get the fleas off him? I saw him the other day going at it and biting his leg. \nHe also gets groomed every four months and it’s about eighty dollars. Does anyone have a way I can teach myself to groom him? I taught myself to cut kids hair. I can teach myself how to cut dogs hair too. In the summer because he swims so much he gets a shave down anyways. Thank you for the help! 🐶",
