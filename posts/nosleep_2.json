        "text": " There is a bar on Cedar Lane. It has been there since before my grandmother was born. No one really knows when the bar was built, but most people think it was made in medieval times and it went undocumented.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's a homely little bar, with a giant red cedar tree growing a few metres away (which is how Cedar Lane got its name). It's not the only bar in our relatively small town but it is the most unpopular. There are so little staff working there that it should probably have been closed long ago. The staff are kind though, that's the kind of trait you need to have when working around the edges of my hometown. My grandmother was a waitress there, as was my mother. It's kind of a family business, I guess (although, we don't own the bar).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI grew up in that bar. I did my homework in the tiny staff room out the back. I remember learning (in secret) how to make the shitty drinks the bar sold. Like I said, I grew up in that old place. My mother recently fell ill, no, that is not why I am writing this right now. I instead want advice. See, recently, I took over for my mom. That was expected, I was her only child.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I started work a week or so ago. It was all fine until yesterday. I was on the opening shift with the waitress, Ophelia. I immediately got to work, settling into the schedule I had set for myself. Check and unlock the alcohol, make sure the glasses are all cleaned, set up. Everything was fine but it was a slow night. I, for some dumb reason, decided to do a full shift which is about 6 hours long, (5pm-11pm) and I would be doing full shifts for about a week as the other bartender went on holiday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first odd thing about the night was that in the first two hours of opening, none of the regulars showed up. That weirded me out a little, especially when Jimmy and Sad Susie didn't show up. Sorry, that is a bit of a mean nickname, I'll explain myself later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey are our most regular, regulars. They are here nearly every single night, and there will always be at least one of them. Well, from what I've seen and been told. Tonight, neither of them were here which did put me off, but I assumed it was fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was not fine. Around 9pm Ophelia took her break. Then she walked in. She was beautiful, with long platinum blonde hair and hypnotising dark brown eyes. She had pale skin and was skinny. I ended up asking if she was okay. Not to comment on anyone's weight or anything but I could see her bones, so you'll understand why I asked if she was alright.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I'm just fine,\" she replied, in a voice that sounded like liquid honey. It was slightly muffled, because she wore a medical mask. It was a bit odd but I kind of assumed she wasn't over COVID yet. \"Actually,\" she had said, \"can I have some help? I can't zip up the back of my dress.\" She had whispered in a flirty sort of tone. I'm pretty sure she batted her eyelashes at me but it's a bit fuzzy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was cautious, we were the only ones in the bar, and I wasn't really supposed to leave from behind the counter. I went to tell her no, but I looked into her delicate brown eyes and couldn't muster the strength. So, I stepped out from behind the counter, my eyes trained on hers. I couldn't look away. Her brown eyes were so pretty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe stepped up to me, the mask crinkling. I guess she was smiling. I didn't look to check. I felt her cold arms wrap around my shoulders, cupping my face. She must have gone up onto her tippy toes as her black eyes levelled with my brown ones. Suddenly, I felt off. There was this utterly gorgeous girl in front of me but all I could think was, 'weren't her eyes brown a second ago?'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe lunged forward and tore her mask off. Large fangs scraped against my face. I fell, the girl on top of me. She went in for a bite, aiming for my face and I quickly pushed her back by her shoulders. My heart pounded in my chest. She bared her canines and aimed for me again, pouncing forward. This time, I let out a shrill scream and grabbed her tooth. I think I snapped it, or I punched her or something else. Like I said earlier, it's getting a bit fuzzy now but all I remember is the loud shriek of agony she produced.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe shrieking stopped. Her body fell to the floor and there was Ophelia. She stood over me, a bar stool in her hand. We didn't speak, just sat and stared at each other. I could feel my black hair stick to my forehead from sweat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe called the manager, Carl, who came in and took over for me. He told me to go home, get some rest. I can't get any rest. My head is running a mile a minute and I've been pondering over if I should quit my job. I don't think I will, though. I will probably ask Carl what the fuck that was. But for now, I'll bundle myself up in my blankets and hide in my bed.",

        "text": "When I was twenty three, I had a security gig at a dairy farm outside of Delphos, Ohio. It was a modest place, only holding a few dozen cows at any given time.  My then-coworker, a thirty four year old “recovering” meth addict named Cory, had just been fired for letting a cow go missing on his watch. \n\nA fireable offense in every sense of the word.\n\nFor starters, Cory was insane. By the time I’d met him, drug induced psychosis had rendered him virtually schizophrenic. On long nights spent with him during my training period, he’d tell me about CIA agents that were out to get him. He was convinced that they were broadcasting thoughts into his head via electromagnetic waves, and that they would stop at nothing to ruin his life. More than once, I’d catch him glancing over his shoulder, or peeking out of windows with a dumb look on his face, hoping to catch a glimpse of whoever was following him. That's the type of person that Cory was. \n\nEach of our cows had an ear tag labeled with a number. At 8PM, they were each to be guided into their own respective stalls and locked in for the night. Padlocks became the norm after an incident with local kids a few years earlier. In the mornings, we’d have to carry around a clipboard containing each lock combination and individually release each one. It made for an annoying way to start the day, but the cows were a hell of a lot more secure that way. That's what made Cory’s story so unbelievable. He had claimed that the previous night, cow number Twenty Nine had been locked away in her stall along with the others. He told us that the only thing out of the ordinary that night was an obnoxious bat stuck in the rafters that he planned to deal with in the morning. \n\nIn order for his claim to be true, an intruder would’ve had to unlock the barn with a set of keys, unlock Twenty Nines stall with the correct combination, then reset both of the locks and leave undetected. Either that, or they picked up a sixteen hundred pound animal and leaped through a window. Considering Corys nasty habit of abandoning his duties in order to twitch and hallucinate in the corner, a small part of me believed that some two-bit thief might’ve been able to get one over on him. My boss, however, a fifty year old hothead, concluded that Cory must’ve been involved with the cow’s disappearance and promptly kicked him to the curb. \n\nWith nobody else to fill his position, my boss had offered to pay me extra for each of his duties that I could complete until we received a new hire. Naturally, I agreed. I’d be heading back to school in a few weeks and needed all the money I could get. \n\nMy first night back at work began normally. Since I’d now be doing the work of two security guards, I’d arrived early to get a head start on Cory’s checklist. I started by sweeping out the barn. Farmhands tried to keep the TMR in a long pile just in front of the stall doors so the cows could eat throughout the night, but that shit practically painted the floor by the time I got there. \n\nMidway through, I’d noticed something reflective in the corner of the barn. I lazily swept a loose bit of corn and hay over to it to investigate. On the floor before me, was a neon yellow ear tag. I picked it up to examine it. \n\n\\[29\\]\n\nNext to Twenty Nine’s ear tag were the skeletal remains of a bat. I guessed that was just another thing that Cory never got around to dealing with. I swept up the bones along with the rest of the barn. By the time I was finished, it was already 8PM. \n\nI made my way out to the fields and then, one at a time, I guided each cow to its assigned stall. I got through about ten or so before I noticed something strange. Across the field, about fifty meters away from the others, was a lone cow. \n\nIt faced away from me, seemingly transfixed on a nearby cornfield. Seeing a cow on its own is nothing strange in and of itself, they need personal space the same as people do. \n\nWhat was strange was the way that her tail stuck straight out from behind her, unwavering.\n\nShe stood as if she were afraid to slip, with her feet planted far apart. Perhaps the strangest of all, her head appeared to be tilted at a ninety degree angle.\n\nI wasn’t eager to tell my boss. They’d put down many sick cows before, but losing two in the matter of a week might’ve been enough to send him over the edge. I decided to save that cow for last as I continued to guide the rest of them inside for the night. Being in charge of twice the amount of cows I was used to was time consuming. It took me nearly an hour to round them up. By the time I’d locked number Thirty Six for the night, It was nine o’ clock. I should’ve been making my rounds by then, especially given the circumstances. I just had that last cow to deal with.\n\nWhile contemplating how long it was going to take me to unlock each cow in the morning, I realized something that made my blood run cold. The only stall left empty was number  Twenty Nine.\n\nI shuffled to the field. Surely enough, she was there. She hadn’t moved an inch since I’d started the process of moving them. I approached her slowly. It was surreal seeing a creature frozen in such an odd position. As I came up on her, I could hear a definite, but muffled, chittering. It was unlike any noise I’d ever heard from a cow. \n\n*What the fuck did you eat?* I thought to myself.\n\nI whistled to the cow before approaching her to avoid startling her. On a dime, the chittering ceased. The cows left ear rose to face the sky and began to oscillate rhythmically like the periscope of a submarine. \n\nI could tell that moving this one would be a challenge. I rubbed her back in an attempt to soothe her. Bonding is key when establishing any sort of relationship with an animal. I’d never interacted with Twenty Nine before, so we were unfamiliar with each other. Her skin felt bizarre, like clay with hide draped over it. I walked around to see her face. Her eyes were peeled open, darting around rapidly, her mouth hung open and drooped to the side. I examined her left ear, searching for a place to reinsert her tag, but there was no piercing.\n\nI strapped a halter to Twenty Nines mouth and began to lead her. It was like trying to uproot a tree with a bike chain. Each tug I gave was fruitless. I began to put my weight into it, but still no luck. \n\nWhen I say“no luck”, I don’t mean that Twenty Nine wouldn’t follow me. I mean that her body showed zero sign of being affected by my body weight whatsoever. Cows are strong creatures, but they’re not made of stone. I was perplexed.\n\nAfter fifteen minutes of this, I decided that it was useless to continue on. With the clock ever-ticking, I could no longer afford to neglect my rounds. I began to walk to the security post to collect my flashlight and get on with the night. As I pondered my life choices whilst dancing my way through a minefield of cow patties, I heard a slow trotting. I looked behind me, to see that the cow had in fact moved. Twenty Nine was now facing me. \n\n*Not so shy now?* I wondered.\n\nI turned around and continued walking towards the gate. When I made it halfway through the field, I began to hear the trotting again. It was louder, and much quicker this time. \n\nI smiled to myself. \n\n*Wish I’d known to walk away sooner.*\n\nWithout turning to face the cow, I walked into the barn and began fumbling with Twenty Nines padlock.\n\n3 left 32 right 23 left\n\nAs the lock clicked open I heard the floorboards behind me creak. A slow vocal droning noise turned to a sickly gurgle. \n\n“I hope to God whatever you’ve got isn't contagious!” I said before spinning around.\n\nAll color drained from my face as I was greeted with the sight of the eight foot tall beast standing before me on its hind legs.  Twenty Nines head was cocked sideways with one eye focused on me. Its pupil seemed to grow and shrink rapidly as it scanned over my entire body. Its lower jaw slowly moved up and down as it began to vocalize again. \n\n“I…..I….”\n\nIt began to creep towards me. Its front legs kicked wildly as it attempted to keep balance, all the while making that same noise.\n\n“I……I…I” \n\nI began to feel light headed.  I grabbed Twenty Nine’s Padlock and made a break for the door. The cow began to rapidly stomp behind me. I began to hyperventilate as I sprinted. The rest of the cows were spooked, shaking and jumping around wildly. I slammed the door shut and clasped the padlock. A sickening boom shook the entire wall of the barn as Twenty Nine began to claw at the door.\n\n“I……I..”..” The beast croaked before chittering once more\n\nI backed away from the door slowly, its wooden frame bending and contorting at the sheer force behind it. Without another warning, I turned my back to the barn and ran to my car as Twenty Nine began wailing and pounding.\n\nI never ended up making any rounds that night. Instead, I started my car and left that fucking place in the rear view mirror. I didn’t tell my boss. In fact, I deliberately avoided several of his phone calls because I had nothing to say. I figured it’d be best if I quit the easy way. There are certain things in life that back you into corners. Silence forces your hand, you know? That's why I’m writing this now. \n\nOf course I still wanted my money. A few weeks later, just before making my two hour commute back to college, I stopped by the farm to pick up my final check. My boss wasn’t in his office on Tuesdays, so I took advantage of the situation and granted myself access with the key that I'd seen him not-so-stealthily kick under the rug once or twice. After snagging my check and a few Jolly Ranchers, I got in my car and slowly began to drive away. Out of the corner of my eye, a young farmhand standing in the grazing field caught my attention. \n\n“Hey kid!” I shouted\n\n“Stay away from the night shift!”\n\nBut he didn’t answer me. \n\nNor even look at me.\n\nHe just continued to stare at the pile of bones before him.",

Brent Marshall cooper.” \n\nthe girl on the other end gasped and clapped her hand over her mouth. i rolled my eyes. this was obviously some prank. i’ve heard about people receiving calls from their dead relatives but never from their future ones. i started thinking back to all the girls i knew who would do something like this before she said something\n\n“what year is it for you?”\n\nwhat a stupid question “it’s 2023. if you don’t stop with your bullshit right now i will hang up this phone and block this numb-”\n\n“wait WAIT- your name is Brent Marshall cooper, you were born in 2004 umm you’re.. 19 right now? you live in La and you went.. you go to Pasadena college and study mechanical engineering. your dream is to move east and settle in new york, um.. right now you’re developing a software with your buddy Samuel..”\n\nterrified i listend eagerly as she listed fact after fact telling me everything about myself. wow these spam call agencies are really getting creative these days. how did she know all this? was she really my daughter? that’s so stupid what the fuck, no she isn’t. \n\n“you’re probably having second thoughts about the software right now but keep pushing i swear it’s worth it-“\n\n“what’s you’re name?”\n\nshe went silent for a moment\n\n“Nora. Nora Phoebe cooper. ”\n\n“Nora. i always liked that name. it means-“\n\n“ “shining light” in latin. i know you told me everyday.”\n\nsuddenly, little jolts of static pierced through my ear. Nora’s tone changed\n\n“listen i can feel you cutting out. i know that our calls going to have to be cut short. i love you dad and i don’t know what fate led you to receive this call but i miss you.”\n\n“i don’t know who you are nora, but i hope i get to meet you in my life time.”\n\n“Bye dad i-“\n\n*budoop* “your call has been disconnected, if you’d like to-“\n\na million thoughts raced through my mind. i don’t know what that was but god damn i hope it was real. if you’re reading this nora, i will name my future baby girl after you. i hope you understand how much that call meant to me.",

        "text": " \n\nDrops of rain spattered on my face. I felt a bottomless pit in my stomach. A hole I had been filling up with endless whiskey for the last month and a half. What stood before me was the edge of a cliff I was about to plunge into. I didn’t care to live. The bottom of my third bottle today gave me the extra courage to not think about it. Soon it would be all over, and I wouldn’t have to live with this misery anymore. I would finally find a sweet release.\n\nAbout to take a step forward, a soft voice came from behind. “Are you going to kill yourself?”\n\nI turned around, confused that someone was in the storming rain. I mean, I was, but I had a reason.\n\nBehind me was a little girl. She stood under five feet, her hair silver-colored and long, stretching down her back. Her skin was pale, her body frail, and she had this uncanny valley feeling. But what put me off was her eyes. The pupils were a milky glaze, but the iris was a bright golden. It was actually beautiful in a horrific way.\n\n“Get out of here, brat,” I waved my hand, wanting this to be a lonely moment for me and not to give a child some trauma.\n\n“But you’re going to jump off that cliff, aren’t you?”\n\nI swallowed, a burning sensation due to all the alcohol I had been drinking today. “Yeah…”\n\n“Why?”\n\nMy head looked down, and I felt shame for what I was about to do. Even though my drunken state was supposed to remove all anxiety, the fact a child was here watching me made me feel even more pitiful.\n\n“Just— it’s been a bad time,” my voice broke.\n\n“Is it because your wife killed herself? Or maybe it was because your son was kidnapped and murdered?” she spoke with a sudden coldness.\n\nMy eyes lifted, and sudden, seething hatred coursed through my veins as I looked at her. How did she know about all that?\n\nI marched towards her, my anger blinding me because I didn’t need to hear any of this.\n\n“I wouldn’t let my hatred get the best of me right now if I were you,” she spoke with authority.\n\n“SHUT UP!” I snapped.\n\nShe didn’t say anything, her lips tightly sealed. I kept looking at her, my hatred still boiling, but when I thought about it a little more, I was able to take a few deep breaths and cool my head.\n\n“No, I shouldn’t have said that to you. But how do you know about my situation?”\n\nShe walked towards me with no fear in any of her movements, and I thought she was blind, but it seemed like she knew exactly where I was. She looked up at me with a dead stare. “I've come to help. Do you know anything about the Redeemer’s Forest?”\n\n“N— No…”\n\nI can take you there. And if you can get through the journey, all your pain will be healed.”\n\nI looked at the child. Her face looked sincere enough, and I thought about what she had said. No, this didn’t make any sense. How would a child know about any of this stuff? But did it matter? I humored her.\n\n“What do I have to do, little girl,” I said with a hint of condescension, but she didn’t seem to take offense to my skepticism.\n\n“Go home. Drink a glass of water. Get in bed at exactly midnight.”\n\nThe rain still splashed on my whole body, leaving me drenched and cold. This may have been a strange hallucination I was going through. But what did I have to lose? I already lost everything as it is. What’s one more night? There’s always tomorrow.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThat night, I did exactly what she said. And right when it was turning twelve, I quickly got into bed and covered myself with the blanket. I thought this was all stupid and that I should be dead in a ditch right now.\n\nI watched the clock from across the room as it abruptly turned to 12:01.\n\n“Well, this was pointless—” without warning, the room suddenly faded, and I was thrown into pitch blackness, and I felt my body freezing up. I couldn’t move, and I thought I was struck with paralysis. My body was constricting, and I felt as if I was being crushed under some unusual weight hiding in the dark. I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t say a thing. I wanted to scream at that moment, but all I could muster was a slight huff of air. Fear took hold of me until I fell unconscious.\n\nThen, I was walking. I don’t remember when I even started. But I was approaching an exit. A light at the end. A crimson light. And extreme heat.\n\nSurprisingly, I still felt like I was me. Like I was alive and fully aware. Nothing like a dream. This was a real place I was walking into.\n\nEmerging from the cave, I saw I had entered somewhere unbelievably distressing.\n\nWhat I had exited was a few outlandishly tall mountains, steep, about a 90° angle. But what lay before me was massive stretches of rolling, blackened dirt fields with dead, twisted trees. Plant life so deformed and mangled, covered in dozens of mouths screaming at the top of their lungs.\n\nI wanted to return to the cave, but it was nothing more than solid rock when I turned around. The rocks were covered in ants that had these alien-like features. They had antennae shaped like slug eye stocks but also three real eyes on their heads and walked around on tiny human fingers. They also made a loud noise that resembled laughing children.\n\nI quickly moved away from them. But I also didn’t want to get closer to the trees. I was at a loss of what to do but was forced to relent and choose the least terrible option. Trees it was.\n\nWalking into the dead forest, I looked up at the sky for the first time. I don’t know why I didn’t do this before, but I did now. I guess my mind was still trying to process everything on the surface. Dark clouds were already in the process of breaking up. But a few of them seemed to resemble skulls. Human skulls rolled on top of each other as the clouds broke apart. Above them, they revealed gigantic eyeballs with massive tendrils stretched over the horizon.\n\n“Sick…” I muttered, unsure if I was having an insanely vivid dream or a bad acid trip. But I don’t take drugs. And I felt truly here.\n\nThe air was crispy. Almost like it was trying to fry my skin off. I was terrified I would cook out here even though it didn’t feel like it should be hot. Yet my body was reacting to it in such a way.\n\n“Hello,” I mumbled, a little scared of what might be attracted to my voice if I called out too hard. But at the same time, I wished there was someone else here.\n\n“Hello, is anyone there?”\n\nTaking a few steps forward, I heard a familiar voice from behind a tree in front of me. The little girl stepped out, and only this time, she had a slight smile on her face. The face looked too mischievous for my liking.\n\n“You did it.”\n\n“Yeah…” I hesitated, “but where exactly am I?”\n\n“I told you, this is the Redeemer’s Forest. I saw you about to make a stupid decision and saw to it that I take advantage of the situation.”\n\n“What? You’re saying you tricked me!?” I stomped my feet forward, the anger in my tone of voice rising.\n\n“I’m sorry. But most people don’t consent to being mentally sent to a reality as nightmarish and atrocious as this place.”\n\nI was about to grab hold of her, angered by her words, but she stepped behind the tree and walked out from behind another one a dozen feet away from me.\n\n“Stop letting your anger get the best of you. It’s not going to serve you well here.”\n\nI was gritting my teeth. I didn’t enjoy getting tricked. I’ve been through so much of that already, and having someone else play with my mind was only causing further aggravation.\n\n“Stupid kid,” I scoffed at her, walking away from this conversation.\n\n“You’ll thank me later.” her voice blew across the landscape, but I was already too heated to want anything more to do with her.\n\nAfter walking around to cool off, I realized I had made a colossal mistake. I had no idea where I was, and now I had no idea how to get out of it.\n\n“Geez, I honestly can’t deal with this today. I knew I should’ve jumped that cliff.”\n\nWhen I finally found the level-headedness I needed to start thinking clearly, the silence was broken by something trudging through the dirt. It sounded gruff and animalistic and had sloppy, fleshy lips smacking.\n\nTerrified, I hid behind a nearby tree; although they were all moaning and drawing attention to themselves, I didn’t think it would affect my chances of remaining unseen. I tried to steady my breath, but my heart was beating rapidly. I couldn’t slow it because my fear of being hunted was already kicking in. Still, I wanted to get a look at what it was.\n\nI peeked around the edges of the tree, my eyes widening when I saw what was making the noise.\n\nStanding at 15 feet, a gargantuanly fat, cow-headed humanoid was tearing through the dirt, its massive hoof-like feet leaving behind ditches. It was covered in dirty, mangled hair as dark as obsidian. Its horns looked to be made of the same material. It carried a long spear and didn’t seem aware of my presence yet.\n\nStill, I knew better than to step out and reveal myself. It snorted, letting out a cow-like call. I felt my lungs seizing up with fear as I tried to pin myself close to the tree trunk.\n\nA loud thumping slowly got closer to me. I couldn’t control my breathing and wanted to start running, but I wasn’t sure if I could out-race it.\n\nA scream erupted. A woman screaming.\n\nI peered out and saw the cowman had grabbed someone else. I wasn’t alone here. He had taken hold of some blonde woman, her body already looking like it had been mangled by previous injuries, and the cow was pulling on one of her arms, crushing it inside his gigantic grasp. She screamed fits of terror, causing me to sweat as I listened to her desperate pleas for mercy disappear.\n\n“Oh God! Oh God! There’s no way that was real!” I choked up.\n\nI held onto my heart, my mind racing with a thousand thoughts about whatever that was.\n\n“It was real.”\n\nMy heart nearly jumped out of my mouth when I heard those words. But I barely regained control of my composure and looked around. I didn’t think anyone else was here, but a redheaded woman stepped out from behind a tree.\n\nI let out a fit-full scream, fear crawling across my brain as I glanced at the woman in front of me. She wore a tattered, dark green robe, torn to-ribbons jeans, and a white T-shirt with over a dozen small holes, but that wasn’t the reason for my panic attack. It was because, sticking out of her skin, all her veins and arteries hung from her body. They were extended so far that many were dragging on the ground behind her, but thankfully they did not appear to come out from her face and hands.\n\n“Dear God, what happened to you,” I fell to the ground and started crawling backward as she approached. Her eyes gave a dead expression as she stared at me.\n\n“I— unfortunately— had a bad experience here a few years ago and haven’t been able to remove them successfully. But if you’re done crying about my appearance, we better find shelter soon. The storm clouds are about to show up.”\n\nShe pointed up at the sky, and I saw it again. Thick, brownish cloud formations were gathering. Slowly they were starting to morph into the shape of skulls and hands with pointed fingers. Looking a little further toward the west, I saw one of the storm clouds had already formed. Gigantic hands were reaching down toward the ground, picking up something too small for me to see.\n\nThe lady was already running, and I quickly returned to my feet, realizing she was no danger to me. I chased after her, desperately not wanting to get caught out in whatever storms these clouds would bring.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe ran for a few minutes until she led me to a foxhole in the ground. I was hesitant to follow, but she crawled in headfirst. Storms were gathering, and I saw long, twisted stretches of tornadoes approaching alongside pillars of blazing flames dancing across the surface of this world.\n\n“Get in,” her voice echoed from the tunnel.\n\nNot wanting to get caught out here, I crawled into the darkness, but thankfully there was a small lantern at the other end.\n\nShe was crouched with her legs pulled up to her chest. She watched as I tried to get myself situated and said, “So, what brings you around here?”\n\n“Oh, you know, I wanted to see the sights,” I sarcastically remarked.\n\n“Very funny. But what is your reason for coming to this reality?”\n\n“I was tricked into making a deal with some little girl.”\n\nThe lantern flickered, and a loud boom echoed from above. I could hear the wind outside picking up and blowing at tremendous speeds that probably would’ve shredded the skin right off of my body.\n\n“I know what girl you’re talking about. She made the same deal with me years ago.”\n\n“Years?”\n\n“Yes,” her voice carried a jolting heaviness.\n\n“What is this place?”\n\nShe thought about it momentarily and explained, “I asked many people who are also trying to survive here. This place, this land… many believe it to be another reality. Something beyond the physical realm that we inhabit. A place only the mind can enter.”\n\n“Heh, seriously?”\n\nShe nodded.\n\n“Then, what was that bull-headed man?”\n\nThat was a Hunter. Not yours, though. This world manifests a monster that aims to find and torture you. And their methods are worse than you can possibly imagine. That bull monster probably belonged to the woman it found and carried off.”\n\n“So I have one?”\n\n“Yes. Everyone gets one. And most of the time, they only go after the person they are specifically hunting. But sometimes, if you find yourself in their way, you’ll be briefly attacked before they get bored and continue their hunt for the main target.”\n\n“But wouldn’t that mean you have one too?”\n\n“Why do you think all of my veins are dangling out from my body?” she stared daggers at me.\n\nI looked down shamefully. “Sorry…”\n\nShe took a few deep breaths and laid back against the dirt wall. We waited for a good while as the storm passed overhead. I kept thinking about why I was sent here. It didn’t make any sense.\n\n“So what reason do you have for being here?” her question rang out.\n\nI scratched my head and thought about it. With nothing else to do and maybe getting a little off of my chest, it might help to tell someone.\n\n“Well, besides being tricked into coming here, I was married. I had a son. My wife and I didn’t talk much, and I hardly spent enough time with them…”\n\nEmotions were starting to well up again. Talking about this became more difficult with each word passed through my lips.\n\n“And?” her eyes had an intense focus on me.\n\n“And one day, he was kidnapped.” I swallowed, a lump growing in my throat with tears trying to force their way out, “We tried our best to cooperate with law enforcement to find him, but a few days later, he was found. Dead in a ditch. And after the autopsy told us about what he likely went through, it broke both of us. No child should ever have to go through such god-awful, traumatic torment right before being… being…”\n\nThe words escaped me. I didn’t feel like I could go further with what I had to say. My heart was aching too much, and I felt intense pain coursing through my chest. My eyes started breaking, and I sniffled louder than I expected.\n\n“I’m sorry that happened. But this place is typically reserved for those who did something wrong. Why are you here?”\n\nI said, “I don’t know. Maybe because I threw myself into my work even more so after it happened. She always complained about me working too much before it happened. Everyone kept saying it was my fault when she broke and took her life. She didn’t want to deal with the memories of what we had gone through. And it left me by myself. Everyone blamed me. Everyone always blamed me. Her dad said it was my fault she did it. That I should’ve been there for her, but no one ever thought about what I needed!” my anger exploded momentarily, which surprised the woman.\n\nFinally, I let the tears escape and wept bitterly. It was too much to keep everything in, and I no longer wanted to deal with this pain.\n\n\"And once she was gone, I lost all meaning to go on by myself, prepared to jump off a cliff and get it over with. I had nothing. And that's when that little girl talked to me.\"\n\nThe redheaded woman's eyes never broke. It dawned on me I had never asked for her name.\n\n\"I'm sorry. I should have remembered this back when we first met. What's your name?\"\n\nShe scratched the side of her arm, keeping herself closed off even more so. I thought I had done something wrong, but she said, \"Angie. Don't worry, I only hesitated because it's been so long...\"\n\n\"So long?\" I questioned.\n\n\"So long since I last said it. I've been here for so many years that I don't know the exact time. A few decades?\n\n\"Why are you here?\" I asked.\n\nShe looked up at me; her eyes were red with tears. Her face dropped to her knees, and she sobbed hard. I sat there quietly until she finished. I felt so helpless because she was hurting; I was hurting. Neither of us knew the right words to say to each other. Maybe a phrase couldn’t be said to make the pain vanish.\n\nShe broke the silence. \"I'm sad to say I don’t remember all that well. Many other people I've met here say the same thing. You must be incredibly new to still remember your reason.\"\n\nI sat there in silence, watching her explosive outburst of emotion.\n\n\"It's not fair!” she shouted before lowering, “I remember there being a little boy. Did I have a son? A nephew, maybe? It feels like I'm responsible for his death. I don't remember it, though. It feels like the memories have died within me.\"\n\nThe wind outside slowly faded from existence. We were now left with a much more peaceful quiet time to recover ourselves and put on our brave faces. She calmed down last, I being the fastest one to steady my feelings, and she felt like it was the best time to exit the hole. She climbed out first, and I followed after, and we were both outside, surrounded by dying flames and scorched trees. The mouths were screaming in agony, bringing me even more discomfort.\n\n\"Is there any way we can get out of here?\"\n\n\"All I've ever heard of is that we're supposed to find a bush. If we find the bush, we can go back home. Something about our sins being forgiven or something.\" she shook her head dismissively at the notion.\n\n\"Well, where do you suppose it is?\"\n\n\"You think we would be here if we knew where it was?\"\n\nNow I understood. It was a hidden treasure we had to seek out. And seek it out, I did. She had grown complacent and had given up any hope, but I was not going to since I was new and still had that fire burning within me to get out. But we’d always retreat to the foxhole whenever another one of those horrendous storms reared its ugly head or a monster would come along, looking for its prey.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nA few weeks have passed. Despite feeling hunger and thirst constantly, we did not succumb to these demands of our bodies. I guessed we didn’t need to eat or drink, although it would’ve eased the suffering. But I was only able to avoid the other problem for so long. Avoid the monsters that roamed about. That changed when I had my first encounter with mine.\n\nI was sitting in front of a tree, listening to its whispers. It wasn't screaming like the others, and I was curious to hear what it had to say.\n\n\"No sight. No sight. Walk. Walk. Walk.\" and repeat. What could it mean, though?\n\nBut a clicking, hissing sound echoed behind me. I was immediately thrown up from my feet, grabbed forcibly by something with sharpened claws, and tossed violently toward another patch of trees.\n\nI hit my head on the trunk, and the tree began to scream excitedly, believing I was assaulting it.\n\nLooking on the other side, I saw a hunched-over, feminine monstrosity. Her eyes were like a hornet’s, her mouth atrociously stretched open to reveal teeth like an angler fish, her arms were absurdly long, practically dragging across the ground, and the claws on those fingers were well over 10 inches. Her skin was a sickly green tint, covered in spider veins, and on her back were shards of her ribs poking out. In essence, pure nightmare fuel.\n\nI quickly got to my feet and ran as fast as I could. There was no way I would let something as heinous as that get its blood-soaked claws on me. But I didn't have a choice when I felt it jump onto my back, pinned me to the ground, and started slicing into me.\n\nI screamed in tormented agony, words escaping me as the air was sucked out of my lungs. The creature kept making that clicking, hissing sound the whole time, and at some point, everything started to turn red. I realized blood was covering my eyes and thought I would die.\n\nSuddenly she stopped, got off my back, and dragged me by my feet, scratching the front of my body up against rocks, dirt, and charred wood.\n\nI tried to get the strength to resist, but I couldn't fight back anymore. My strength was gone because hunger and thirst had left me somewhat paralyzed. I kept crying out for Angie, but I never saw her. Where could she be? I thought I was being loud enough. But she never came.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe following events were some of the most unpleasant. I would spend an undetermined amount of weeks being tortured. She had left me in a cave, somehow having chains ready for me and keeping me in place. She would occasionally go out, giving me a moment of peace before she would come back with a clay bowl filled with acid.\n\nBut before she did what she did, she put this strange, fleshy substance over my eyes. I was effectively blindfolded.\n\nShe'd dump the bowl on my head, and I felt all my hair and skin melting off. This was unbearable agony that nobody should ever experience. It felt like I was being specifically targeted for no good reason, just like how everyone always targeted me back on Earth. They blamed me for things that were out of my control.\n\nOnce she melted the skin off, she took her long claws and effectively gutted me. How I was still alive, I had no idea.\n\nShe mangled my body until it was a broken tangle of flesh and bones. Still, she never took off the fleshy flaps from my eyes. I kept wondering why my eyes were being protected? I tried asking her, but she stuck one of her long claws right down my mouth, popping out the back of my head.\n\nAfter enduring this for so long, I had grown used to the torture. My body was sapped of blood and water, and my nerves had already been fried to the point where I couldn't feel anything anymore. I could still hear, smell, taste, and I guess see if it wasn't for the flaps, but all sensations of the skin, as well as internal organs, were basically dead.\n\nOn one particular day, my hunter left, likely to get more acid, and I heard someone's voice call out to me.\n\n\"Psst, hey, are you there?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" my hoarse voice called back.\n\nI heard the sound of footsteps approaching and a loud gasp. \"Oh God, what has that thing done to you!?\"\n\nWhatever was done to me, it had to be bad.\n\n\"Don't worry. I think you can still move,\" she reassured me.\n\nI felt her hands around my cheekbones, and she peeled off the flap from my eyes. The damage my body had sustained was more than extensive. My skin was nearly gone, my muscles exposed and rotted, and a few internal organs were visible.\n\n\"You won't like this, but you can't die here.\"\n\nI smiled, even though I knew most of my teeth were gone. \"Yeah, I kind of figured that one out on my own.\"\n\nShe found the key nearby and got me out of the chains. She explained that she had been looking for me the entire time. She wasn't sure where I had been dragged off, but when she found another wanderer passing by, he mentioned about me in the cave.\n\nI wanted to fall asleep the whole time, but I had to hold out until we got back to the foxhole. She said everything would be better once we got there. I remember little of the journey, only remembering she stuffed me down the hole first, but I was a mangled mess of flesh and bone. She crawled in and rested on the other side. Her face was screaming exhaustion, and both of us finally rested.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI woke up, not from any rested feeling, but only because I felt immense pain return. It was the type of burning sensation you get when you touch glowing hot iron. My exposed muscles had gotten dirt in them, and the stinging was so bad I could barely get up. Nerves returning?\n\n\"JESUS! GOD, WHY DID YOU LET THIS HAPPEN!?\" I shouted.\n\nThis stirred Angie, and she saw I was having the worst of wake-ups.\n\nShe calmly replied to my rhetorical question, \"Maybe we deserved this?\"\n\n\"Why!?\" I shouted, taking another look at my body and noticing it was healing. Even though my hands had most of the flesh melted off, all the way to the bone, it was scabbing back up, and some of the meat had been growing back over the fingers.\n\n\"We did bad things,\" she sighed, \"now we live in this place.\"\n\n\"I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG!”\n\nShe lifted an eyebrow. “Are you sure?”\n\n“YES, I JUST—\"\n\nI stopped. Tears welling up. I realized what I had done wrong.\n\n\"I wasn't a good husband or father...\" I mumbled, disturbed by my own words.\n\nAngie watched as I realized what I had done wrong. I wasn't there for those who needed me. I was neglectful. I didn't pay enough attention to my son, thus losing him. I didn't comfort my wife or even try to be there for her in any capacity. I simply went to work and tried not to think about it. I abandoned those who needed me. Was this why the girl chose me?\n\nI felt a looming presence nearby, and Angie's and my eyes drifted toward the exit. It was the little girl. Her appearance was different. She didn't look so sickly and uncanny as before. Now she appeared with long, blonde hair, a healthier body weight, and skin as perfectly clear with no blemishes or imperfections. Her eyes still had that glow, but it had dimmed a little.\n\nBoth of us jumped back, but it was more painful for me to do so. She had a slight smile growing on her face and said, \"Good, you're making progress. You're getting close to escaping now. But you'll have to have faith and believe things will work out. This is my final message to you. I didn't do this to torment you. Your torture is of your own creation. It's up to you to make the final choice. Now find the bush.\"\n\nWith those words, she turned back and climbed up the hole, sparking my curiosity to follow suit. Angie followed too, and we watched as she hopped on the back of a creature that possessed the body of a deer, but its head was an owl possessing four faces on each side. Each of the owl's eyes was a different color, and the neck would spin to change looks. Its tail was also extended and covered in hair like a horse, and it had absurdly long goat horns piercing out from atop its head. The fur was a mesmerizing malachite color.\n\nThe creature shook its head briefly and frolicked away, disappearing into the smoke and fire with that strange girl.\n\nAngie and I returned to the foxhole and contemplated what our next move would be?\n\nI thought long and hard about what she was talking about. What could someone like me do? I concluded that I should have done more for my wife and son. God only knows I would try to make everything right if I could, but maybe that's not the point. I've accepted that I've made some bad decisions. I have to live with them now.\n\nAngie sat across from me, staring at the fire inside the lantern. Then she propped her head up. \"I know what I did.\"\n\nTears fell as dew drops on glass until she stared back at me.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I killed my nephew.” those words hung for a moment, “I remember now. Or rather, I had been suppressing these memories for so long that I genuinely believed I did nothing to deserve any of this. But I do. I deserve it all...\"\n\nI got up to sit closer to her, and she held onto my arm. The feeling of the veins still dangling on her skin was an uncomfortable feeling when they rubbed up against my partially healed skin.\n\n\"I was young. I wanted to be a great aunt. I brought him with me to a party. I thought everything was okay and that I was invincible. I drank a lot, even did a few drugs. I was a little too confident that I could still drive when the party was over. I...\" she paused, her face melting into a much more broken person than before. Again, she almost looked like she was losing her will to breathe.\n\nI reached my hand and covered over hers, \"It's okay. I'm not one to judge.\"\n\n\"We crashed,\" she said.\n\n\"I thought so.\"\n\nShe covered her face a little, her weeping filling the cramped space.\n\n\"My sister was so heartbroken about what I did. I tried apologizing, but she said that she'd never forgive me. I got defensive. I don't know what came over me then, but I thought it was her fault. I even came up with the stupid rationalization that she should have been smarter to not trust him with me. I got into a bad habit of never taking the blame.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" I said.\n\nWe sat there in silence. The lantern's flames were the only warmth to fill our icy cold. I was hollow now. I felt as if there was nothing more than complete self-loathing living within me. We both kept crying until sleep finally was kind enough to take us out of it.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI came outside some hours later, still looking at all the screaming trees, the skull clouds, and the sharpened rocky mountain ranges surrounding this strange reality we had found ourselves trapped in. But there was one tree I always happened to notice whenever we were in a different section of the land. Every now and then, there'd be a tree that only whispered. One near us. I kept looking at it.\n\nIt would repeat, \"No sight. No sight. Walk. Walk. Walk.\"\n\nAngie climbed out of the hole and saw what I was doing. \"Something caught your eye?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Why do most trees scream, but there's always a strange individual among them that whispers those words?\"\n\nShe saw what I meant and replied, \"I couldn't tell you.\"\n\n\"No sight. No sight. Walk. Walk. Walk.\" I repeated the phrase.\n\n\"It probably doesn't mean anything.\"\n\n\"Why did my hunter make sure my eyes stayed intact? Unless...\"\n\nI took a few steps forward, swallowed despite the dry mouth, and told Angie, \"Walk with me.\"\n\nShe did. We walked, passing by all the trees. Hearing the chaotic roaring of hunters nearby. The cries of people who were being caught by them. And yet I was sure this was the only way to get out.\n\n\"Angie, I need you to trust me. Keep walking, but keep your eyes closed.\"\n\n\"What? That's dangerous. It'll be more difficult to find the foxhole.\"\n\nI didn't stop moving, but I said, \"Faith Angie. We have to have it to escape from here. That's what the girl made it sound like.\"\n\nShe looked reluctant, but when I met her eyes, she nodded.\n\nStill walking, I closed my eyes. I had to keep breathing, maintaining a calm heart. And that was difficult when you were worried about crashing into a tree. But surprisingly, I never crashed into a tree once. When my eyes were shut, it felt like I was walking not on rugged, battered land but on the smoothest possible ground, like marble, solid and stable.\n\nI kept pace and started to hear something. The crackle of a fire. And I felt the warmth of it.\n\nWhen it became unbearable, I stopped and immediately felt Angie bump against me from behind.\n\nThe heat was so intense it actually hurt my eyes. I took a few steps back and saw we had approached something unique.\n\nIt was a large patch of bushes. But they were all on fire. Engulfed completely, yet physically unharmed. Burning bushes. A spectacular view.\n\n\"Is this the bush she was talking about?\"\n\n\"I can't imagine there being another one. She certainly left out the part where it was on fire.\"\n\n\"What now?\" I asked.\n\n\"I don't know?\"\n\nI breathed, the burning heat passing into my lungs. It was far too hot for one to comfortably stand near.\n\nI walked around the bushes, wondering if there was something behind it. But there was nothing. And when I returned to Angie, we heard the shrieking of something chilling. My hunter had found me.\n\nWe looked towards the direction where it came from. Behind us was my hunter and hers. It looked like a knight. Its armor was spiked and covered in crimson and black material. And its face was morphed to resemble a tiger helmet, and from within the mouth, hooks were reaching out.\n\nWe were trapped. I looked at them and back at the burning bushes, Panic setting in until I saw it. A path going right through the large patch. Just enough for a single person to fit in.\n\n\"We have to go through,\" I grabbed her arm, moving closer.\n\nBut she pulled back, saying, \"We'll die.\"\n\n\"We can't die here.\"\n\n\"It'll hurt.\"\n\nI turned to the flames, then back to her. \"It will. But sometimes you have to suffer for things to get better.\"\n\nOur hunters were getting closer, and I took one deep breath. I had to believe there was a way out. Although I was not religious, I found myself praying.\n\nBracing myself, I took the first step and felt the stinging burns of embers beneath my feet. It was instinctual to jump back, but I had to take the next step. I moved forward, my raggedy clothes catching, and the flames rapidly crawled up, dancing all over my body.\n\n\"GOD! OH GOD!\" I cried.\n\nFlames cooked my flesh, blackening it and leaving it crusty. It took every ounce of adrenaline coursing through me to keep going through but running proved too much. I was forced to walk at the fastest speed possible as the flames rapidly deteriorated my body. My eyes started to melt, and my bladder released, only to boil on my exposed muscles. I couldn't take it anymore, and I wondered if Angie was even following behind me.\n\n*\"Little more,\"* I thought.\n\nMy eyesight was gone, but I knew to keep going straight. The fire burned me up faster, and I struggled to keep my feet forward, thoughts of turning back screaming at me. I stopped breathing; it was too much. I stubbornly kept my mindset despite that inferno destroying my existence. Finally, I felt a release overtake me after I threw myself forward with one giant step.\n\nThere was nothing for a moment. Emptiness. Bodylessness. The obliteration of one's physical existence. And yet, still alive.\n\nSuddenly, I found myself covered in ice, throwing myself forward and realizing I was covered in a cold sweat. My lungs were heaving hard, and I looked around to see I was in my room. My mind was going a million miles per hour, and I realized what had happened.\n\nI was home again. I made it. I made it through the burning bushes.\n\nThe emotions I was feeling were beyond overwhelming. I was about to go into hysterical crying until I felt the tugging of the sheets. I looked to my left, and I saw... I saw her. It was my wife again. She was alive.\n\n\"Kaylee,\" the words rolled out from my mouth as I caressed her cheek with my fingers. To have that touch again was the most incredible feeling ever.\n\nShe stirred awake, only to see her husband in the middle of an emotional breakdown.\n\n\"Hey, what's wrong?\" she said, concerned.\n\nNo longer able to hold back, I quickly wrapped my arms around her, hugging her more tightly than ever. Thankfully, she returned my hug. That touch was something I could not treasure enough. I never wanted to release her, and I cried. Cried so hard as she pulled me closer. Together again.\n\nI finally answered her question, \"Just a really bad nightmare.\"\n\nAgain, I could feel her warmth. I was spared of my misery. I had my happiness, and I felt like I had earned forgiveness.\n\nI had her back. And I had my son too. I had returned three days before his kidnapping, and I made sure it could never happen this time around. We avoided it, and I made sure to have every opportunity I could to spend time with them. I never wanted to leave them alone, and I worked hard to find a job that would allow me to work at home. It was less money, but my wife understood I wanted to be with them more. And she did too.\n\nI don't deserve this. I don't deserve them. But I'll never stop cherishing the time I spend with them. And I hope Angie was as fortunate as I was. All I can say is you should always try to appreciate the good things you got. Because not everyone gets a second chance. It's better to be happy with your blessings. It's better than having to walk through the flames.",

I knew he was struggling, but I thought things were turning around for him.\n\nHe went missing last week and I’m not sure what to do. I know I should go to the police, but I just think he got involved with something he shouldn’t have. He was making money very quickly over the past month, and it really freed us from some stress.\n\nI feel really terrible. Right now all I have to go off is his journal. I got him one of those Moleskin ones for Christmas and he started using it at the beginning of the year.\n\n\\-----------\n\n**February 2**\n\n*Today was a long and tiring day. Me Sarah Alex and Emily moved into the new house off Oakland ave It's not what Sarah and I imagined but it’s a start. We've been struggling more than I’d care to admit recently.  I was laid off again. Terrible timing sense we just bought a damn house. Three times in two years I imagined life differently. I wish I went to college maybe I would have done more for the family. I hope Sarah loves me as much as she use to*\n\n**February 5**\n\n*Sarah is picking up extra shifts at the hospital. Shes amazing. Alex and Emily are doing well in school which makes us feel like great parents. They apparently are even using Apple laptops in some of the classes. I thought we were cool in high school when we got to go to the computer lab and sit at a desktop for an hour and learn to type. Anyway, I dropped off applications at all of the dealerships service departments. For the rest of the week I want to fix up this place and make it feel more like a home for us*\n\n**February 6**\n\n*I touched up the paint and put new handles on the kitchen cabinets. I spent the rest of the morning working on the dryer in the garage. Were making it a makeshift laundry room until we decide what to do. The drum is making crazy noise when we run it with a full load of wet clothes. I think it needs a new belt. I also need to find a place to store some of my old tools since Alex is always practicing juggling his soccer ball in the garage. I know he does it even though I tell him not to. Last thing I want him to do is knock something over and get a major cut from a saw blade*\n\n**February 11**\n\n*I’ve gotten sidetracked by something I found in the basement. An old wardrobe. It’s crazy, I don’t remember seeing it when we toured the house. It’s old and damp. It does something. I don’t know. I can’t explain. I made little hooks for my tools and hung them up. Then I left the drill on the baseboard of the wardrobe. It’s an old, crappy drill but has always done the job for me. Well I went to get my drill today to work on the dryer again and it wasn’t there. A super expensive drill with all sorts of nice drill bits and accessories was sitting there. The thing must cost four or five hundred bucks. I never seen anything like this. I am going to try something tomorrow when Sarah goes to work*\n\n**February 12**\n\n*I can’t believe it! I put three dollar bills into the wardrobe. An hour later, I checked. There was a $100 bill in there place. I’m going to the bank tomorrow to get more money. I think I can fix our problems. Also Miller Brothers called about a position but I told them I’d call them back.*\n\n**February 16**\n\n*Luck has finally rolled my way! I took the family out to a nice dinner tonight at Red Lobster. I don’t think finances will be causing us issues anymore. I’ve made $4,000 with the wardrobe. I am gonna get more expensive things to put in it.*\n\n**February 22**\n\n*Sarah is wondering if I’m doing illegal stuff. I didn’t know how to respond. Not because I’m hiding anything, but because I don’t know if it’s illegal. I guess I am hiding something the more I think about it. I told her I won the lottery. $50,000. She hugged and kissed me. It made me feel succesful. We talked about moving to somewhere nice but I know that’s not a good idea. I don’t want to move the wardrobe. I also figured it’s best to not draw too much attention to us right now.*\n\n**February 24**\n\n*Things are going great still at home. Well for the most part. Something has been on my mind lately. But I’m not sure what to do. The kids are healthy and in school. Sarah is doing great and has been able to cut down on picking up shifts. I have stacks of money put away for rainy days and all our bills. I’d like to put myself in the wardrobe and see what happens. I don't know how to explain it but I feel like I have to. Like the wardrobe is whispering to me. I dream about what could come out if I step in.*\n\n**March 5**\n\n*I went ahead and climbed into the wardrobe.* \n\n*I knew it had unknown risks but was too curious about the prospects. I felt an incredible tingling rush through my body when I closed the door behind me. I allowed myself to stay in it for just a few minutes. I already feel different, sharper. I don’t know how to describe it.* \n\n*When I stepped out of the wardrobe, I was greeted with a world that seemed both familiar and yet completely foreign to me. The colors were brighter, the smells more pungent, and the sounds more vivid. My mind was ablaze with new thoughts and ideas, and I saw the world in a way that I never had before.*\n\n*Suddenly, everything made sense. As I looked out at the world, I realized that so much of what I had once thought important was now trivial. The things that had once consumed my thoughts and feelings were now mere distractions from the greater questions that the universe posed.*\n\n*As I looked out at the world, I knew that I had a role to play and that my journey was only just beginning. But first, I need to make sure that Sarah, Alex, and Emily are set up with more permanence.*\n\n**March 7**\n\n*I went to look at a strip mall to potentially purchase.* \n\n*It has six commercial occupants, a few of them doing impressive numbers. Around $500/sq ft. The entire lot is valued quite richly, but we're quite liquid at the moment and need to become the opposite. It’s a cliche for someone in our shoes, but I’ve undoubtedly realized Sarah and I need to prepare ourselves to launder this money I'm generating. The strip mall was about an hour North.* \n\n*On my drive up, I noticed my head began hurting. It was a sharp, stabbing pain that turned into a deep, dull ache... It was cold, almost feeling like there was ice suddenly inside of me. I subsequently noticed a sudden hunger to return to the wardrobe. It was unsettling.*\n\n*But I continued on my way.*\n\n*While I was walking around with the realtor, touring the area, I noticed the pain growing intenser. I think it gets worse the further away I get from the wardrobe. I wonder... No, I have this innate feeling I need to go back to it for longer. I’m missing a piece of the puzzle. Tomorrow... I'm going to figure out what's going on with this mysterious object I've found myself intertwined with.*\n\n\\-----------\n\nYou guys are all caught up now. \n\nI know I’m going to sound crazy, but one piece of all of this has just left me beyond confused. I went to the local county assessor's office this morning and asked them about the house. They pulled out the blueprints and explained to me that while our house once had a basement, it was closed off and filled in 30 years ago after a chemical spill.\n\nI’ve been telling Alex and Emily that dad’s away for a job interview. I told my parents the same thing. I just don’t know what to do. I'm so worried about Dan.",

        "text": "Exactly one week ago, Monday to be exact, I was going to have to keep my word. I made [an oath](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zu5pm6/im_a_barista_at_a_caf%C3%A9_that_serves_the_odd_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to restore the Drowsy Spectre and in doing so betrayed Selene. Rykar would have her name for his dark purposes and I think we can all be certain whatever he did with it would be bad for all of us at the shop. If this is your first time finding me, though, start [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/AHauntedBarista/comments/11dsc3v/the_drowsy_spectre/). \n\nWhen I heard a knock at the door, I felt a full force anxiety attack strike. Suddenly I could float, or at least felt equally weightless. So empty that I worried opening the door might see me taken by a breeze. No, I was not scared that Rykar would hurt me. I was too useful to him. I was frightened at the prospect of losing what I had built at the Drowsy Spectre. My relationships, my friends. What else did I have? The cafe had a way of making sure it was your life. Dan learned that the hard way, but at least he *had* something out there in some fashion. I have nothing.\n\nI could betray my oath. Rykar would take me as his puppet, in servitude, and I would lose everything regardless. That scared me too.\n\nRegardless of the decision I would make, I approached the door. The action of reaching for the doorknob seemed so slow, but finally I pulled back the only barrier protecting me from the golden-eyed devil.\n\nBut there was no Rykar. Instead, a young child with the void in their gaze stared up at me. Their eyes weren't black, they were just... endless. I felt as if light was being pulled into them, consuming even the lights of the apartment complex and the room I stood in. The young girl wore jean pants and a graphic t-shirt with a design that I didn't recognize. Aside from the terrible gaze, I would have assumed she was simply lost.\n\n\"It is cold. Can I come in?\" She asked, her voice no different than expected.\n\nDid that ever work? There was such an overwhelming sense of doom in the air that I don't think I was physically capable of accepting. \"N-no.\"\n\nThe girl did not argue or fight with my answer. Instead, she turned and looked on at the night sky. Where were the stars? \"The Eyeless bids you speak, else gold and crimson be your tomb.\"\n\n\"Speak? What do you want me to say?\"\n\n\"The interloper's name. Her safety shall waken the eyes that know the flesh.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"You are not asked to.\" Another voice stated, this one a boy's. I hadn't noticed that at least four more children had come with the girl, with ages all ranging from eight to teens. \"Answer true.\"\n\nWere they here on Rykar's behalf? \"Did he send you?\"\n\n\"No.\" She lifted a hand, revealing teeth. \"You did.\"\n\nThat didn't make much sense, even if the tooth issue was somehow my fault.\n\n\"It eats us. If we lose our numbers, eyes will be taken. Speak true, and banish your child.\" With that, the children went on their way.\n\n\"Wait!\" Answers were worth the dread their presence brought. \"I don't have a child! What do you want from me?!\"\n\nIt did not seem wise to chase them, so I didn't. Despite that, I was awarded with one last, cryptic message.\n\n\"Stay inside, Fatewriter.\" That kid could be no older than four. \"A rain not unfamiliar is coming.\"\n\n\"What does any of this mean? What is Fatewriter?\"\n\n\"Your story is but a prologue to the end of all things. The void cannot end.\"\n\nWith that, they were gone.\n\nI closed the door and was left to think of the strange, unwelcome questions that those children had laid upon my mind with words far older than the tongues that spoke them. When the child said rain, did he mean a storm? As in there were bad times coming?\n\n\"That wasn't him, was it?\" Laura climbed out of the top of her room. I call it a room, but it is really a repurposed terrarium typically meant to house a lizard of her species. It was large, though, and contained certain miniature amenities that a woman (or anyone that liked comfort, I guess) might want. She was [originally human](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/z7nxvm/im_a_barista_at_a_caf%C3%A9_that_serves_the_odd_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), after all. \"That sounded like a girl.\"\n\nTo those new here, Laura came to our cafe seeking help after she was turned into a gecko by a trickster in the woods. As it turns out, that was Em's father. We tried to complete a [ritual](https://www.reddit.com/user/AHauntedBarista/comments/zoshjn/im_a_barista_at_a_caf%C3%A9_that_serves_the_odd_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to get her body back, but we screwed it up and she was put into a fly instead. Well, we kept the gecko she used to be (which had become a regular lizard) as well as Laura in her new... well, less preferred form.\n\nI'm sure I will get to writing it all down eventually, but her spirit and soul is back in the gecko again. We are sort of stumped on how to proceed. Her experience as a fly, however, has made her much more appreciative of her reptilian state.\n\n\"No, that was someone else.\"\n\nA head escaped the pillows of my small couch. \"The Eyeless.\" Silence stated. \"They live in the woods. I have seen them at the treeline when you are at work.\"\n\nSimilar situation with Silence. Em's father cursed quite a few people, Silence was one of the few to escape. She's been a snake so long, however, that she can't remember who she was before. In a way, that makes things more convenient for me; at least I am not trying to figure out how to fix her. The wishing doll would probably do it. Unfortunately it can't help Laura seeing as the ritual we did invoked the Eye of Gold.\n\nHindsight is twenty-twenty, right?\n\n\"They have eyes, I am pretty sure.\"\n\n\"Like the woman that [spoke to you](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zfr74z/im_a_barista_at_a_caf%C3%A9_that_serves_the_odd_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) months ago?\" Silence came further from her cozy hiding place. \"You said she had no eyes. The children have none.\"\n\n\"I was just talking to them. They have eyes, they are just... not right.\"\n\nSilence flicked her tongue. \"Or they are not eyes.\"\n\nSuddenly she turned her head towards the front door. Without hesitation, she retreated to her place inside the couch without a word. Laura wasted no time either, entering her hide as new animal instincts told them of some threat approaching. Even I felt it, like a mighty thunderstorm was on the horizon and just out of sight.\n\nIt was Rykar, of that I was certain.\n\nThere was no knock, but I went back to the door regardless. I took a deep breath, having lost most of my anxiety when the children came along, and steeled what was left in my nerves before pulling it open.\n\nHe wasn't waiting on me. Not at the door, at least. In the parking lot of the small complex, which was lit by two weak lights, stood a man dark as the night. His teeth shined like stars when he smiled.\n\n\"Come down, my friend.\" He beckoned. \"We have much to discuss.\"\n\n\"You can come inside.\" Maybe it was a bad idea to invite him in? I didn't want to go out there. \"You said you were going to come to me.\"\n\nHis smile faltered. \"There is something...\" Rykar looked at the sky. \"Familiar.\" I had never seen Rykar nervous, nor had he ever stepped away from something he wanted. He was like a god to us, and suddenly he was a scared one. \"What have you done?\"\n\nI honestly had done nothing to keep him away. That would sort of go against our deal. Without another word, Rykar became one with the shadows and vanished.\n\nThat is when the rain started.\n\nI didn't think anything of it. Who would? But when it started falling more steadily and began pooling on the walkway outside my door, dripping over the railing, I noticed that it wasn't right. It was... yellow. Thick too. My first thought was that it had ran through something on the roof seeing as the structure wasn't well-maintained. Only the pasty, waxy consistency was on the ground too. It was as if a great candle burned above me, high in the clouds.\n\n\"A brief glimpse.\" A voice spoke from down below. Was that a mouth set *in* the pavement? \"A brief glimpse of what could be.\" It licked massive, pink, fleshy lips that seemed to have formed from the rain itself. \"A fading flower, a scent of a greater and endless field. What do you think, Fatewriter?\"\n\nI wasn't going to speak with it. That would be stupid.\n\n\"What say you, writer?\" Another voice beckoned. A smaller mouth had taken root on the support beam of the complex. It slid down slowly with the rain. \"Speak...\"\n\n\"...sweetly.\"\n\nI closed the door. No, I wasn't going to get into something new. Or old, I guess? Here I was with *two* sentient animals, a cursed doll that burned me when I didn't make wishes, a deal with an actual god-demon, and now this. What the hell was that?! It still rained outside, but if the mouths were still there the door muffled them too well to hear.\n\nBut my blinds were open.\n\nEyes had formed on the railings, that was unnerving. What caught my attention, however, was something far in the distance. It was like a star, but closer and with more detail. I knew what it was, I had seen it before. A immeasurable golden eye, set deep within a great storm. It scared even Rykar away, but it wanted me. It had seen me and now it wanted something.\n\n\"I'm not going to.\" I said, hoping that it could somehow hear me and understand. I wanted and *want* nothing from it. With a finality I hope I can live up to, I shut the blinds and closed the curtains.\n\nThen I sat on the right side of the couch (Silence had claimed the left side, a rule set so I didn't accidentally sit on her). I wasn't going to sleep that night, not that I was tired considering my overnight schedule.\n\nBut even if I had been, the eye that watched me from the skies above ensured that there was no rest for neither my body nor my soul.\n\n\"Don't come out.\" I advised my friends. \"Just... don't. Sleep.\" They wouldn't if they knew.\n\nWhy was I being focused and not the others at the shop? I am not quite as new as I once had been, but they've been there longer!\n\nIt is all getting exhausting and quite old. I am lost.",

        "text": "\"Look kid. She only comes out during the 1am hour. So, just be careful, okay?\" I looked at him, skeptical. I think he could tell I didn't believe him as he continued, \"This is serious okay, just promise me you won't talk to her.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Okay. I promise.\" He smiled a fake smile and let me leave his office. What a load of BS. I thought to myself. Did he really think I was going to believe that some creepy chick in a hooded cloak that only comes out at 1am was real? How stupid did he think I was? I walked over to the time clock and punched in. 10:08pm. Great. Late on my first day and it's not even my fault. I walked back out into the kitchen. My anxiety rising. You see, I don't know anyone here, but I needed a job to get my own place. It's not a great job, just an overnight drive thru job at a local fast-food place. Nowhere you've probably even heard of. The name isn't important, mostly because I don't want anyone looking for it and trying to prove my story right or wrong. I promise you however, what I'm about to tell you is real, and I will never forget that night for the rest of my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10:13: I take my place at the drive-thru window where I would be until 6am. None of the other employees have approached me, and I am completely okay with that. I did notice a few of their names on their nametags. Jim is the guy on the grill and Tina is on the register. Owen, the manager who was pulling my leg about the \"hooded woman\" had just left for the night. Tina would be leaving at midnight due to the fact that the dining room closes then. The drive thru, however, stays open 24/7.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10:21: My first car approaches, finally. It's a family of 4. A woman, presumably the mother is driving, the father in the passenger seat, and two young girls in the backseat. I ask the woman for their order, and she gladly gives it to me. Now comes the hard part, social interaction. We're an old school type of fast-food place. Therefore, I had to actually go tell Jim the order. I reluctantly walk over to the grill where is standing playing on his phone. \"Um, hey Jim, we got an order.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"FINALLY!\" He says, with a smile creeping across his mustached face. I read him the order, 2 kid's meals, no pickle on the burgers, and 2 large chicken tender meals. \"Aye-aye Captain,\" he says giving me a sarcastic salute. I smile and walk back to the window and wait for the order to arrive, which it does in no time at all. I give the kind family their food and prepare for more boredom until the next customer arrives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10:35: Jim walks over to me and begins to try to make small talk. \"So, you're Daniel, right? I see Owen didn't print you out a nametag. Figures.\" I smile at him, but don't say anything. \"You don't talk much, do you? That's cool. Well, if you have any questions about how things work around here, don't be afraid to ask.\" I immediately jump on his offer, \"So this 'hooded woman' thing, Owen haze all the new guys like that?\" His face grows cold, yet he manages to let out a nervous laugh. \"Well, if there is a 'hooded woman', I sure haven't seen her, and I've been working here for 9 months now.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10:53: \"So, what's it normally like here at night?\" I asked. He looked around the empty restaurant, \"You're seeing it, kid.\" He replied with a laugh. \"Nobody really comes here late. Most folks are already asleep.\" I shook my head in agreement. I look over to Tina, who is sitting on the counter taking pictures of herself. \"What's up with her?\" I ask him. He rolls his eyes, \"Your typical case of daughter needs a job and Daddy gives her one.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"You mean Owens her dad?\" He nods. She's far too pretty to be related to him I think to myself. Me and Jim continue our small talk for what feels like ever. Talking about anything and everything. Soon enough, midnight rolls around, and Tina is quick to wave goodbye and get out of here. I don't blame her. I really didn't want to be here either. Jim was making it a little bit easier though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n12:13: I surprisingly get another customer at the drive-thru, a truck full of high school aged kids. They order enough food to feed the entire U.S. Army. They get their food, and drive off into the dark, cold night. \"Hey Jim,\" I yell back to him. \"Do you mind watching the window while I go use the bathroom?\" He nods and walks over to my station.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n12:17: As I enter the stall in the men's restroom, I notice something that sent chills down my spine. On the back of the stall door were the words \"SHES COMING\". I shivered as I sat down on the toilet and grabbed my phone out of my pocket. Great. No signal. Looks like it's going to be a very long night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n12:34: I realize I've been in the bathroom for far too long. I wash my hands and head back into the kitchen. \"There you are! I thought you fell in or something.\" he joked. I smiled, \"Nah, the hooded woman got me.\" I laughed. He did not. He gave me another uneasy smile. It kind of freaked me out but I didn't believe in this stuff anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1:00: I start to feel uneasy. I knew that I was just paranoid, but the moment the clock struck 1, something just didn't feel right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1:04: As I look out the drive-thru window, I swear I saw a figure moving in the darkness, though it's far too dark to know for sure. The drive-thru lights barely reach 10 feet away from the building, so in order to see something, they'd have to be very close.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1:11: \"I'm gonna go take a piss,\" Jim exclaimed. I shot him a smile. A weak smile, but a smile, nonetheless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1:17: There's a knock on the door of the dining room. \"I'm sorry, we're closed!\" I scream loud enough for anyone to hear me. However, the knocking continues, quickening with every knock. I'm really hoping Jim gets out of the bathroom soon. I'm starting to get freaked out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1:20: The knocking at the door stopped. I hear the bathroom door open and am relieved to see Jim make his way back out. He notices my worried expression and I tell him about the knocking. His face once again grows cold; however, he's not looking at me, he's looking behind me, through the window. He slowly raises a finger to his lips as if telling me that in making any noise, I'd seal both of our fates. \"I'd like to make an order please.\" A woman's voice called out from behind me. The voice doesn't sound right though. The pitch is off. The words just don't seem like they have any life behind them. Jim shushes me again. I give him a nod. \"Hello?\" The womans voice calls out. I turn around to look at her and am terrified by what I see. There is a figure facing away from the window. It looks almost human, but not quite. Its arms were too long, and the way it was hunched over didn't seem normal. It wore a long black cloak with a hood over its head. I reminded myself of what Owen told me. Don't speak to her. I didn't believe any of this at first, but I was starting to lose my skepticism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"We need to leave\", Jim whispered to me, and I nodded in agreeance. He held three fingers up, then two, then one, then pointed at the door, we both bolted for it. He was slightly faster than me and made it outside much faster. \"Wait for me,\" I heard myself say. Only I wasn't the one who said it. \"Sorry man.\" Jim said. \"hahahahahahaha\" I heard in the woman's inhuman voice. The next thing I heard was Jim's screams. I stood motionless, still inside of the store. \"It's okay. I'm okay. Are you alright in there buddy?\" I heard her say in Jim's voice. I resisted the urge to speak to her and instead decided that I needed to get out of here as quickly as possible. I quietly ran to the kitchen and grabbed a spatula. I made my way back to the drive-thru and threw it out the window. The woman growled with pleasure at hearing the noise. I heard her uneven footsteps as she ran across the concrete.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wasted no time in running to the front door, and out to my car, ignoring the sight of Jim's mangled body in the parking lot. I locked the doors and turned the key in the ignition. As I looked out the window of my car, I saw a sight that will forever haunt me. The woman was standing right outside the door, this time facing towards me. Her face was a pale white with a hideous smile that was too big for her face. I didn't take the time to memorize all of her features, I knew I had to get the hell outta there. I slammed my foot on the gas pedal and never looked back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeedless to say, I quit that job after my first night there. However, I still visit during the daytime, and am astonished to see Jim flipping burgers in the kitchen.",

I don't know what happened to me, I don't know where I was, or what took me, and this has been eating away at me in my mind to the point I desperately need to share my experience.\n\nI always had an interest in astronomy, and upon the trillions of galaxies out there I knew there was no chance Earth was the only place with life. However, I didn't believe any potential extra terrestrial beings  are smart enough to have or visited Earth. And to be honest i'm still somewhat skeptical, but this experience changed my thoughts forever.\n\nThis all happened in Ohio, where I was born. Me and my two other friends were camping in Hawking Hills Nature Park fishing near a lone lake in the twilight, the view of the night sky was amazing, due to there being little light pollution to drown the views of the Milky Way. We cracked jokes and sat in our foldable chairs and made a mini bonfire to accompany us for some light and warmth. Now I'm an avid nature guy but when it comes to waiting for something to catch your line, I get pretty impatient.\n\nWe enjoyed some drinks and s'mores occasionally pulling in a Bluegill or Bass throwing back into the water after some pretty sick pictures with them. We had drove to this place by car with foldable tents, meaning using the bathroom was just directly towards the undisclosed part of the forest. I excused myself as I got up and trotted through the weeds making sure not to stray too far from our camp site.   \n\n\nThats when things got weird. I remember being blinded by a neon white light shining through the foliage about 200 or so feet away. a bird or too fluttered away as I finished, zipping my pants back up assuming the light to be some other person exploring the trail with a very, very bright flashlight so bright in fact, my eyes stung from looking at them. The flashlight stayed positioned as if someone was purposely pointing it at me before the light multiplied into seven others all rotating clockwise in silence. \n\nSurprised by the sight, I turned to yell for one of my friends to get over here with a light while the other watched over our site for any raccoons or any fish. My Friend Ashton flashed his flashlight around the trees scanning the area for my silhouette among the trees, after jumping from my ghostly appearance he trotted down the small weed covered hill towards my direction. The seven lights had stopped rotating, and now began to glow a faint red. I asked him if he had brought his phone, But we both left them in our handbags in the car. \n\nWe spent a moment staring at the light, the faint red glow silently beckoning us to go towards it. I wasn't thinking, Im not sure why or how but I started to walk towards it. Like something was moving me like a puppet. My friends followed after me trying to get my attention but I just couldn't talk, I was at a loss for words and short of breath. The light got closer and closer to us. I walked towards It. It felt like the most beautiful, magnificent thing I've ever saw. I Lost all sense of thought other than to walk towards the ever-glowing light. The sounds around me turned to a fain humming. Thats all I remember. Being enveloped in a warm blanket of light. The world around me disappearing. \n\nI came to my senses feeling like I was on a wheeled bed being spun around like a rollercoaster. It felt like I was rolling down a steep hill in a bed. Once I came to my senses, I couldn't move, and I had no energy to talk. 4 tubes were stuck to my sides and ends. My eyes were fixed on a brightly lit metal, blurry ceiling. I could feel myself on a table, or countertop. I had no recollection of how I even got here. But as I woke up, the sense of touch began again. Something was holding my right arm out gripping my wrist with its dry hands. I moved my blurred eyes in curiosity. \n\nA old, Brown, Frail skinned figure reached a metal device up to my arm, barely bothering to look at me. It held it up to my arms and legs before placing the measuring tool behind it. I was nude, On a random table in front of what looked like the chocolate obsessed old lady from Spongebob. It took a glowing rod surveying every inch of below my neck. I could barely make out its face or black eyes. \n\nThe things murmured to each other, there were others in the room. All surrounded in a circle around me, paralyzed, unable to yell or ask what the hell is going on. Without any anesthesia or morse, I felt them slice a small chunk of my leg off with out having any skin contact with me. I wanted to scream in the pain, get up and get out. But I was frozen, lifeless like a statue. I heard as they placed the flesh into a jar with prongs as an arm extended from the ceiling wrapped my leg in a sticky liquid. \n\nThey cut pieces of my hair off, them too placing it into a jar, avoiding any visual or hand to hand contact with me like I was infected with the plague. I wanted this to end, to leave, I wanted to know who these were and why they were doing this. they extracted my blood via a needle to the arm, and pried open my mouth shining the rod inside like they seemed to be scanning my teeth and gums. Closing my mouth with the prongs. I closed my eyes praying for this to end as I felt the hard pressure of the tubes release from me with a pop. Immediately Just like that everything had disappeared. And I woke up in a sweat on the forest floor. \n\nThe night sky above me, accompanied a large, triangular floating \"island\" with dazzling rotating lights floated above me, before floating away in the blink of an eye. Ashton cam to me helping me up, He too had been knocked out, claiming he woke up near a tree. In no way did he mention any of what I had witnessed, except for the comment on my now bloodied right leg assuming me to have scrapped it badly on a rock.\n\nI agreed with what he said, too afraid to tell the truth, we both saw those lights, and we both don't know what that was. And we had only been gone for 20 minutes, for what seemed like hours to me. I don't know what happened. I don't know if I should say this, but I truly experienced something beyond imaginable.",

        "text": "For the uninitiated and unconverted this entire post will seem like the ramblings of a madman. And perhaps it is. But for those of you out there who practice the rituals, I implore you: tell me what I must do to bring my friends back. I’m seeking a *true* ritual master. No more soothsaying charlatans burning incense, pretending to have fits, and playing with cards. There is nowhere left for me to turn but here. And if any of you have lost loved ones to the Others… Please, forgive me. I did not know any better.\n\nMy thoughts and memories surrounding the Calamity are fragmented and, despite the many years which have passed since, still painful to revisit. By structuring the events chronologically I hope to paint a clearer picture of what transpired immediately following the failed ritual and the conception of the Others. Not only for my fellow ritual practitioners, but for myself as well.\n\nI fear I may have overlooked some crucial detail in the ritual. With your help, perhaps I could achieve now what I failed back then. We were, after all, only children, with no real concept of what we were doing.\n\n**In a span of seven hours after the Calamity:**\n\n1,\n\nAdam lost an arm. It tore from its socket with less effort than you’d tear damp paper. The screams of his agony rang harshly in the valley in a surreal sort of way. I was truly convinced it was a nightmare in that moment. Does that absolve me from the sin of abandoning him?\n\nAdam lay writhing in pain while the Others gathered round his half-naked body, the sweat on his bare chest glistening ever so slightly in the pale moonlight. They walked toward him as if it were the first steps they had ever taken, stumbling around like newborn babes. *It would not last long. Soon they would learn to run.*\n\nMy lungs burned and my legs cried in pain. But though I could see neither my two feet nor the path ahead, I ran as fast as a startled deer and, as I imagine the animal does as well, I thought of nothing but survival as the sickening sounds of their feast commenced behind me.\n\n2,\n\nMiranda surrendered and they embraced her as a sister. Who could blame her? At the thought of being devoured alive, the flesh ripped from your bones as you were paralysed by a choking fear, it was no wonder that she’d choose the path of less pain.\n\n*Of course, once she crossed over she was no longer Miranda. It seemed no different than death, in essence, but it was a more palatable form of the condition to the mind of one desperate to survive.*\n\n3,\n\nNiko killed one, then took its place.\n\n*When faced with the horror of what he had done, his burning anger was extinguished in an instant. Niko* *surrendered himself to the embrace of the Others with a welcome sense of relief. Becoming one of them was less painful than living with the knowledge of what he had actually done: cracked open the head of his best friend with a frantic swing of his arm and a particularly sharp stone. The blood had gushed from Jon’s skull like water from a* *split* *coconut.* *In the blinding light and the smoke and the confusion, such a mistake could surely have been forgiven, but forgiving oneself is often more difficult than forgiving others.*\n\n4,\n\nAs soon as I had time to reflect on what had happened, and the fire in my lungs had settled, I lost the last remnants of my faith in a dank cave five miles from our campsite. The inherent goodness of the One, which we had all come to believe in, was unmistakeably a lie.\n\n*My devotion to the One had been my everything. It had given me my dearest friends, and they had given me hope that life could be different for us.*\n\n*Every one of us had been broken in some way, whether through abuse, misfortune or from birth, but our belief in the One had been our salvation. The power of the One gave us hope. We had formed a connection to something beyond our individual selves, becoming links in an unbreakable chain rather than five indistinct chunks of corroded metal.*\n\n*That sense of belonging had been shattered by the Calamity, and in its wake the nebulous emptiness had crept back into my heart and made for itself a permanent nest. If only I could snap my fingers and go back in time, I would’ve tried to be content with what I had before the ritual.*\n\n*By the time I realised what I already had they were all gone. Isn’t it always so? And the fault was entirely mine. I had convinced them to do it, pleaded with them to help me bring my family back. How could they ever have refused such a request? My selfishness gave them no choice.*\n\n5,\n\nI returned to the campsite for the book. At this point, logic and reason had all but left me, and I could not—would not—leave it behind.\n\n*Niko had found the nondescript book in his father’s garage, but I had been the one to mould it into an (admittedly primitive) ideology. It contained a series of individual rituals meant to appease the One, an enigmatic being whose nature was never explained or described by the author or authors.*\n\n*At first we were just playing around. The book was just a book, and the rituals it contained were simply a game. That all changed when our second attempt at a ritual transmuted the water in Adam’s bottle into dozens of pristine diamonds. We only realised when he started choking on them. After our first successful ritual, the book became our Bible and the One became our God.*\n\n6,\n\nI killed my first one. The being sat motionless, hunched over the burnt-out coals of our campfire. Part of its spine had split open the skin, and a foul red slime oozed from the visible vertebrae. Then, as I approached, it started grunting, rocking back and forth with its long arms wrapped twice over around its knees. It let out a loud, lonely, accusing howl at the fading moon. A series of howls answered in the distance. They would all be returning soon.\n\nI picked up the largest, heaviest rock I could find and smashed it into the back of its head. It screamed like a banshee and struggled under my weight as I straddled it from behind, kicking with its many legs and scratching at my eyes with long arms and claws at the end of them like the talons of a hawk. Fortunately, the first blow had left it weakened, or I would have died there and then. I lifted the rock again with both hands and brought it down on its head, putting all my weight behind the strike. The sickening, wet sound made me vomit the last of our last dinner together. Its frantic movements stopped after a few moments’ twitching.\n\nI turned it over to look at its face. The being had once been Miranda. Her pale skin had acquired a deathlike grey-tinted pallor, and her face had shrunk on her head in an almost comical way. Her nose, her mouth, and her eyes were all centred, perfectly to scale, in a small indentation the size of my fist.\n\nYet her eyebrows and her hair remained where they had been before. Almost she seemed like her human self, and guilt at what I had done threatened to consume me then. But her body was twisted and scaled; the skin cut open in parts by jagged pieces of bone. This was no human. Red slime began to ooze out of her small mouth and nose, out of her ears, and out of the many deep wounds that covered her body.\n\nI grabbed the book and fled as fast as I could, blinking away the tears.\n\n7,\n\nBack in the safety of my cave, I flipped through the pages, desperately searching for a way to undo what I had done and convinced them to do. Many of the rituals required multiple worshippers, but not all. Conjuring fire, transmuting liquids, enchanting a weapon… Such things were a trifle even for one person, but especially for me.\n\n*Undoing our attempted resurrection was not. Indeed, there did not seem to be any counter-spell mentioned at all, unlike for the other rituals. A former practitioner (perhaps Niko’s late father?) had left a single, hastily scribbled note in the margins of the page, which I had conveniently forgotten to mention to my friends.*\n\n“**Those who challenge the One’s Death MUST** **pay Death’s toll.”**\n\n8,\n\nA storm raged outside, which added a certain dramatic effect to my desperate resolution: I would undo all of it. I had to. The book in my hand would allow me to tap into a veritable fountain of the One’s power. I’d cup its traitorous liquid with eager hands and drink. It was either that or suicide. Living with the guilt of what I had done was not an option then.\n\n*Nor is it now.*\n\n**The aftermath**\n\n*I made my way back to the city, alone, clutching the book tightly to my chest. Each night I heard their howling. Their accusing screams echoed in my head. I cried myself to sleep and drank only water as a form of penance. Not that it helped anyone, but the pain and the hunger tasted to me of justice.*\n\n*Somehow I made it back intact. A few missing orphans were not the cause of too much alarm initially. The only one among us who had someone who cared about them was Niko. His mother never forgave me and never visited me again.*\n\n*At her hysteric insistence, the police launched a reluctant and frankly half-hearted search, convinced as they were that the little brats would soon return of their own accord. A few weeks later they began a more serious investigation, but by then most in the community determined it to be far too late. The missing boys and girls were certainly dead; it was only a matter of time before their bodies were found. The world was not kind to* *stray* *children, and especially not to the broken and unwanted ones. As for myself, I was forgotten, falling between the cracks as most orphans do.*\n\n*Once life had settled back into a routine, as it inevitably always does, I began my research. Young as I was, there wasn’t much I could do in those days except flick through the book and consider my options. The ordeal had taught me patience. I could not afford another failure.*\n\n*There was nobody to ask for help back then, either. Over time, however, I encountered other groups who had practised the rituals of the One, and I learnt what I could from them. I soon realised that I was far more adept a practitioner than they could ever hope to be. Most of my research has since been conducted in perfect solitude.*\n\nI hope you’re different from the rest.\n\n**Thoughts on the ritual of resurrection**\n\n*“Those who challenge the One’s Death MUST pay Death’s toll.”*\n\nWell, it had always seemed obvious to me that each ritual must have its price. Its required reagents, for one. Then something to seal the spell and determine the intended target. Why should the ritual of resurrection be any different?\n\nMy lifeblood, the blood which I shared with my family, was the toll I had paid. A dark scar on my palm remains to make sure I never forget. The ashes of my brother, father, and mother, kept in a pendant around my neck, served as the seal, almost like an address to the underworld. I mixed it with some of the blood (for added potency) then fed it to the flaming tongues of the campfire.\n\nThe law of conservation of energy applies to all rituals, in a sense. The energy is taken from you or from your reagents. For a loyal follower the One gives some of their own energy to balance the scales, as it were. Yet, unbeknownst to us, our ritual of resurrection was half-baked and our offering less than insufficient. The result was beings who were not quite alive and likewise not really dead. The family returned to me by the One were not as I had expected them, to say the least.\n\nAnd so it was that a group of five children, one of them particularly adept at the rituals, created the Others, huddled together as they had been around a flimsy campfire in an otherwise unassuming meadow miles away from the city they called home. They had been laughing and smiling, hand in hand, just before the Calamity struck with a sharp crack, like a sanguine bolt of lightning from above.\n\nMoments before, I had flashed a seldom seen smile at them, my friends whom I loved, and who were willing to do anything for me and my happiness. What a fool I had been. And still am. For the only thing I live for now is to bring them back. No matter the price.\n\n**A bitter game of cat and mouse.**\n\nTwo more of the Others I’ve killed in the years following the Calamity. Their bodies look different now, more human and fewer legs, but their faces haven’t changed. I buried them near our original campsite with the rest. Three still pursue me, and those like me. People like you.\n\nThey’ve learnt much over the years. They’ve learnt to do strange magicks of their own. They’ve learnt to blend among the humans. They’ve learnt to track me as well as to elude me. And they’ve grown much, much stronger. The only saving grace is that each generation of their progeny is weaker than the last, or my folly would certainly have doomed the world and all in it.\n\nOur game of cat and mouse still continues. Am I the predator or the prey?\n\nOnce I’ve gathered the last of their bodies, I hope to perform another ritual. A stronger one of my own design. Death’s toll will be their bodies showered in my blood. Or is there something else that the One wants? My life? So many have died since then. Some parts of *me* have died since then. Have I not already given enough to the cursed One? I’ve paid my toll.\n\nTwo decades have passed since the Calamity, but I firmly believe that I can still redeem myself. It cannot end like this. I won’t allow it.",

        "text": "Paige and I had been dating for almost a year when I caught her sneaking my bloody Kleenex out of the bathroom trash.\n\n“What are you doing?” I asked as her eyes went wide, realizing she’d been spotted.\n\n“Just taking out the trash,” she said, a little too fast.\n\nI might have let it go, but now that I was on the lookout I noticed other strange behavior. A week later, I let her cut my hair and found the trimmings in a large plastic bag hidden way up in the closet.\n\nAnd another time, when she didn’t think I was looking, I saw her take a trimmed piece of my toenail and pop it into her mouth like a Skittle.\n\nI started thinking about our whole history together. The way she always gushed about the way I smelled after sex. Or how she loved to playfully bite my lip.\n\nThen one day, I came home from work early and found one of my used bandaids in a cup of boiling water. \n\n“What the fuck?” I shouted. “Is that my blood?”\n\n“It’s not what you think,” she said. She’d been chopping onions, and she walked toward me, knife in hand. “I would never hurt you. I just… have this thing. This thing where I want to eat people. I know it’s something we have to work through, but it’s just the way I am.”\n\nI felt like I wanted to throw up. I couldn’t take my eyes off the knife in her hand. I took a step back, forgetting about the staircase to the basement. Then I felt myself falling and everything went black.\n\nI woke in the hospital. It could have been a night later or a week. All I knew was that I could barely move my arms and everything felt hazy.\n\n“You’re up,” said a familiar voice, and I looked across the room to see a blurry figure approaching. “Good. There’s been something I need to do.”\n\nThen she pulled a razor from her pocket and started walking toward me.\n\n“I’m so sorry you had to find out this way,” she said. “I’m so ashamed. I guess I was worried that if you ever found out, you’d stop loving me.”\n\nI tried to speak, but all that came out was a raspy hissing sound, like the last belch of a deflating balloon. \n\n“You still love me, right?” she asked. “Just nod if you still love me.”\n\nMy heart rate monitor was beeping like crazy as the razor in her hand caught the blinking lights of the equipment. I tried to move my arm, but it was like I was wearing a lead suit. I probably would have pissed myself, but I had a catheter in.\n\nI nodded, trying to gurgle out a “yessss.”\n\nShe headed to the sink, letting steaming water run into a metal bowl. She wetted a warm washcloth and laid it on my face, letting the heat loosen my skin. Then she removed a small bottle of shaving cream from her purse and rubbed it over my cheeks.\n\n“You never could pull off a beard,” she said, and I realized I must have been stuck in that hospital for even longer than I realized.\n\nSlowly, carefully, Paige began to shave me. With each swipe of the razor, I wondered if she’d slash me open. I imagined her pressing her lips to my bleeding wound, drinking her fill, her eyes rolling back in pleasure. I imagined her slicing off my ears and fingers, crunching them like crudites.\n\n“Hold still,” she said, cutting downward, and I closed my eyes, ready for the final cut.\n\nBut it never came. \n\nAfter a few minutes, I was totally clean shaven.\n\n“You’d better marry that one,” said Dr. Kingston the next day when he arrived a few hours later. He gestured at Paige, who was sleeping peacefully in a chair near the foot of my bed. “Dropped everything to be here with you all month. Even quit her job on the spot when they denied her PTO. Doubt my wife would do that for me.”\n\n“Am I going to be okay?” I asked.\n\n“In a while… yeah,” he said. “Don’t worry. I’m sure she’ll take care of you.”\n\nThe day we got home, I was feeling tired, so I headed straight to bed. I walked into the bedroom to find clean sheets and a massive “Welcome Home” banner. Bags of all my favorite snacks we laid out on a side table.\n\n“Thanks,” I said, not quite knowing what to say. “That’s really nice.”\n\n“I found the ring,” she said after a few seconds. “The one in your dresser drawer. I wasn’t snooping or anything. I was just trying to get you clothes.”\n\n“Paige–”\n\n“And I want you to know, I really would be the best wife. I’d love you hard every day. And yeah, maybe every once in a while I’d eat something I shouldn’t, but maybe that’s not so bad, you know? And I hope… I hope we get old and die on the same day, the same second. But the one thing you should know before we go a second further, is that if you *do* die first, I would eat you. I wouldn’t waste a scrap. I’d boil your skin and bones, I’d fry up your organs. I’d savor the taste of your ribs and muscles. And I need you to know that. To be okay with that. I need you to know.”\n\nI could tell she was close to bursting into tears. Slowly, I crossed the room and wrapped my arms around her.\n\n“Okay,” I said quietly.\n\n“Okay?”\n\n[“Okay.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)",

Her nose, her mouth, and her eyes were all centred, perfectly to scale, in a small indentation the size of my fist.  \n\nYet her eyebrows and her hair remained where they had been before. Almost she seemed like her human self, and guilt at what I had done threatened to consume me then. But her body was twisted and scaled; the skin cut open in parts by jagged pieces of bone. This was no human. Red slime began to ooze out of her small mouth and nose, out of her ears, and out of the many deep wounds that covered her body.  \n\nI grabbed the book and fled as fast as I could, blinking away the tears.\n\n7)\n\nBack in the safety of my cave, I flipped through the pages, desperately searching for a way to undo what I had done and convinced them to do. Many of the rituals required multiple worshippers, but not all. Conjuring fire, transmuting liquids, enchanting a weapon… Such things were a trifle even for one person, but especially for me.\n\n*Undoing our attempted resurrection was not. Indeed, there did not seem to be any counter-spell mentioned at all, unlike for the other rituals. A former practitioner (perhaps Niko’s late father?) had left a single, hastily scribbled note in the margins of the page, which I had conveniently forgotten to mention to my friends.*  \n\n“**Those who challenge the One’s Death MUST** **pay Death’s toll.”**\n\n8)\n\nA storm raged outside, which added a certain dramatic effect to my desperate resolution: I would undo all of it. I had to. The book in my hand would allow me to tap into a veritable fountain of the One’s power. I’d cup its traitorous liquid with eager hands and drink. It was either that or suicide. Living with the guilt of what I had done was not an option then.  \n\n*Nor is it now.*\n\n**The aftermath**\n\n*I made my way back to the city, alone, clutching the book tightly to my chest. Each night I heard their howling. Their accusing screams echoed in my head. I cried myself to sleep and drank only water as a form of penance. Not that it helped anyone, but the pain and the hunger tasted to me of justice.*  \n\n*Somehow I made it back intact. A few missing orphans were not the cause of too much alarm initially. The only one among us who had someone who cared about them was Niko. His mother never forgave me and never visited me again.*  \n\n*At her hysteric insistence, the police launched a reluctant and frankly half-hearted search, convinced as they were that the little brats would soon return of their own accord. A few weeks later they began a more serious investigation, but by then most in the community determined it to be far too late. The missing boys and girls were certainly dead; it was only a matter of time before their bodies were found. The world was not kind to* *stray* *children, and especially not to the broken and unwanted ones. As for myself, I was forgotten, falling between the cracks as most orphans do.*\n\n*Once life had settled back into a routine, as it inevitably always does, I began my research. Young as I was, there wasn’t much I could do in those days except flick through the book and consider my options. The ordeal had taught me patience. I could not afford another failure.*\n\n*There was nobody to ask for help back then, either. Over time, however, I encountered other groups who had practised the rituals of the One, and I learnt what I could from them. I soon realised that I was far more adept a practitioner than they could ever hope to be. Most of my research has since been conducted in perfect solitude.*  \n\nI hope you’re different from the rest.\n\n**Thoughts on the ritual of resurrection**\n\n*“Those who challenge the One’s Death MUST pay Death’s toll.”*\n\nWell, it had always seemed obvious to me that each ritual must have its price. Its required reagents, for one. Then something to seal the spell and determine the intended target. Why should the ritual of resurrection be any different?  \n\nMy lifeblood, the blood which I shared with my family, was the toll I had paid. A dark scar on my palm remains to make sure I never forget. The ashes of my brother, father, and mother, kept in a pendant around my neck, served as the seal, almost like an address to the underworld. I mixed it with some of the blood (for added potency) then fed it to the flaming tongues of the campfire.  \n\nThe law of conservation of energy applies to all rituals, in a sense. The energy is taken from you or from your reagents. For a loyal follower the One gives some of their own energy to balance the scales, as it were. Yet, unbeknownst to us, our ritual of resurrection was half-baked and our offering less than insufficient. The result was beings who were not quite alive and likewise not really dead. The family returned to me by the One were not as I had expected them, to say the least.  \n\nAnd so it was that a group of five children, one of them particularly adept at the rituals, created the Others, huddled together as they had been around a flimsy campfire in an otherwise unassuming meadow miles away from the city they called home. They had been laughing and smiling, hand in hand, just before the Calamity struck with a sharp crack, like a sanguine bolt of lightning from above.\n\nMoments before, I had flashed a seldom seen smile at them, my friends whom I loved, and who were willing to do anything for me and my happiness. What a fool I had been. And still am. For the only thing I live for now is to bring them back. No matter the price.\n\n**A bitter game of cat and mouse.**\n\nTwo more of the Others I’ve killed in the years following the Calamity. Their bodies look different now, more human and fewer legs, but their faces haven’t changed. I buried them near our original campsite with the rest. Three still pursue me, and those like me. People like you.\n\nThey’ve learnt much over the years. They’ve learnt to do strange magicks of their own. They’ve learnt to blend among the humans. They’ve learnt to track me as well as to elude me. And they’ve grown much, much stronger. The only saving grace is that each generation of their progeny is weaker than the last, or my folly would certainly have doomed the world and all in it. \n\nOur game of cat and mouse still continues. Am I the predator or the prey?\n\nOnce I’ve gathered the last of their bodies, I hope to perform another ritual. A stronger one of my own design. Death’s toll will be their bodies showered in my blood. Or is there something else that the One wants? My life? So many have died since then. Some parts of *me* have died since then. Have I not already given enough to the cursed One? I’ve paid my toll.\n\nTwo decades have passed since the Calamity, but I firmly believe that I can still redeem myself. It cannot end like this. I won’t allow it.",

        "text": "*We’ve been trying to reach you about your car’s extended warranty.*\n\nI chuckled, almost in disbelief after I answered the phone. Almost all the calls I received on a daily basis were spam, sent straight to voicemail, but this time I was bored. I had nothing to do that afternoon, and fucking with a spam caller felt like a fun challenge. The message felt outdated, too long to still be used. There was no way people were still falling for it. Still, I felt compelled to respond.\n\n“Ah yes, my warranty! I’ve been trying to get a hold of someone to talk about it,” I said, intrigued to hear the robot’s canned response.\n\n“Do we have your consent to transfer you to a representative?” The voice responded.\n\n“Yes.” After my response, I felt a tinge of fear, vaguely remembering a news article in which it was warned against giving them a recording of you saying ‘yes.’ I decided I was worrying about nothing, so I tried to focus on the muffled hold music. After a few vacant moments, I heard a click, and a pleasant woman’s voice.\n\n“Hello sir, thank you for your response. May I ask about your car’s make and model?”\n\n“Of course, I have a 1987 Honda Accord.” I tried to stifle my laughter. It was just old enough to be absurd, but still a possibility, had the car hibernated in a garage for twenty years. I heard the distant sound of keyboard keys clicking, and she spoke again.\n\n“Thank you. And may I also ask for your name?”\n\nI paused, contemplating my answer. “Stanley Lewis,” I replied, falling back on the pseudonym I created in my youth to avoid using my real name. Another pause as she input the information.\n\n“How long have you had your car, sir?”\n\n“Thirteen years to the day.” I cringed after that line, but this interaction had no consequences either way.\n\n“I see. Well, the warranty applies to the car for 20 years after purchase, but as you are not the original buyer, the warranty extended after you changed the registration.”\n\n“That’s wonderful news,” I said. “What does that mean for me?”\n\nI was excited to hear her answer. “If you have accrued a certain amount of miles on your vehicle, you may be eligible for some repairs. Some owners with cars similar to yours have reported failing parts at a certain mileage.”\n\n“Interesting,” I replied. “How would I apply for these repairs?”\n\n“If you give me your address, I can have an information packet and application delivered to your house in less than a week.”\n\nIf the introduction to the call hadn’t indicated to me that the call was spam, asking for my address would’ve started the alarm bells. I wandered over to my fridge and picked up a pamphlet. “Sure thing. 1956 North Ridge Avenue.” I tossed the Chipotle coupons back on my table, going back to the living room.\n\n“Great. Thank you for your participation, Mr. Lewis. Have a blessed day.”\n\n“Have one yourself.” I took my photo away from my year, and smiled to myself for another second before finding another way to entertain myself.\n\nThe next morning I awoke, achy and discombobulated. It felt as though I had ended the previous night with a vigorous workout as opposed to the wine and Netflix I had treated myself to. I stretched, making my way towards the bathroom for a sauna-like shower.\n\nAfter preparing for my day, I shuffled out to my car, tossing my backpack in the passenger’s seat next to me. As I was backing out of my driveway, I caught a glimpse of an unusual car. I turned my head and shoulders in a complete 180, swiveling in disbelief. Driving quickly past was an old Honda, and although I didn’t get a clear view, the trunk looked like it had a word beginning with ‘a.’ It had to be an absurd coincidence, and I couldn’t be sure that it was specifically a 1987 model. I’m no Honda connoisseur.\n\nI drove to work, glancing around for the car, but it seemed to have disappeared after my neighborhood. Over my lunch break, I called my girlfriend, casually bringing up the strange occurrence while we talked about our days. I could almost feel her roll her eyes over the phone. We chatted idly about our days, and she went back to work.\n\nOn my drive home, the old car didn’t cross my mind once. I pulled into my driveway, texted my girlfriend, and headed inside. After shedding my work clothes, I began cooking dinner, preparing spaghetti for her arrival. After about thirty minutes, I began glancing at my phone. It usually only takes her about twenty to come over. After another worrying fifteen, I got a text.\n\n*I was in an accident. Im ok*\n\nMy stomach dropped. \n\n*Where r u?*\n\nI stared at my screen, anxiously awaiting her response. When the three dots popped up, I realized I had been holding my breath.\n\n*Corner of maple and mulberry*\n\n*cops here*\n\nOnce again, my keys were in my hand, and I hurriedly put on a jacket, rushing out of my door. My hands were shaking as I sped towards the avenue. When I arrived, there was a small ambulance and a police car, circled around only my girlfriend’s car. It looked like she had been rear ended, only minorly, but she herself looked understandably shaken up. \n\nI walked towards her, hurrying out of my car. She sighed heavily as I gave her a hug.\n\n“I’m glad you’re okay,” I said, looking down at her face.\n\n“Me too, and it shouldn’t be too expensive, but insurance is gonna be a bitch. It was a hit and run.”\n\nIt was my turn to sigh. “Did you see the car at all?”\n\nAmanda shook her head. “Not really. It looked kinda old and it was a gross gray color.”\n\nA police officer strolled over. He had a notepad in his hand, and looked mildly bored, like a car accident wasn’t exciting enough for him. It might not have been.\n\n“I’m sorry ma’am. Do you remember the license plate? Any features of the driver or the car?”\n\nAgain, she shook her head. “Only what I told you, I barely noticed he was driving away until he was halfway gone. I was still in shock about the crash.”\n\nHe nodded, and scribbled something down. “Very well. We’ll keep in touch, but I honestly wouldn’t have high hopes. No traffic cams and barely any identifiers. Maybe the age of the car, but we’ll see. I’ll take you to the tow guy.”\n\nShe nodded this time, following behind. She looked at me. “Can’t I drive it home?”\n\nThe cop shrugged. “Maybe - his call, not mine.”\n\nAt first, the drive home was quiet. I held her hand and maintained the speed limit, trying to provide the least stressful drive possible. It looked like something was bothering her, but she didn’t say anything. \n\nAfter a while, it came out. “You know the car that hit me?”\n\n“Uh huh. What about it?”\n\n“Well… it was old, wasn’t it?” She was looking over at me, concerned.\n\nI swallowed, trying not to think about the possibility. “Yeah, it was from the eighties.”\n\n“Did you give them a color?”\n\nAfter thinking about it, I replied, “no color. Just make and model.”\n\n“Hm.” She turned, looking out the window. I knew what she was thinking, and the possibility scared me. At the same time, how unlikely was it? I happened to see the car I described passing by my house. It happened to rear end my girlfriend. Was I in a scrapped draft of Goosebumps, haunted by a shitty 35 year old car?\n\nAfter almost three weeks, I started to forget about the car. No incident occurred, the police didn’t find who hit Amanda’s car, but her insurance paid out the damages. Life moved on, and I felt less jittery. Of course, something had no change. I couldn’t be lulled into a false sense of security forever. \n\nOne day, I tossed my mail on the kitchen table, adding it to the pile that I let accumulate every week. After sorting through all of the junk and promotions, a small red envelope caught my eye, and when I pulled it out, I felt a cold stab of fear run through me.\n\nCAR WARRANTY NULL AND VOID\n\nStanley Lewis\n\n1461 Chestnut Pl, Lakewood MO 63342\n\nThey knew my address. I don’t know how, but they knew where I lived. I began to panic, trying desperately to remember my phone call. I gave them a fake address across town. How the fuck did they know my address?\n\nThey still used my fake name. If they knew my house, how did they not know my real name? A moniker I used to sign up for websites as a child, pretending to be 13. That’s all that was protecting me from the stalkers I apparently led to myself. \n\nI contemplated telling the police. What would I say, that I saw a car once and a letter vaguely related came to my address? I put my head in my hands. As if by fate, I got a call from Amanda.\n\n“Good morning! Do you still want to come to the lake with me today?”\n\nA fun lake day was the last thing on my mind. “Mands, I love you, but something weird is happening.”\n\n“Oh?” She sounded concerned, she could tell something was off.\n\n“The stupid car people know where I live. Something is fucked up with this whole situation.”\n\n“Woah - hang on, how do they know where you live?”\n\n“They sent me a fucking flyer saying the warranty is null. What does that even mean?”\n\nShe was quiet for a few seconds, I could almost hear her thinking. “I don’t even know what to do, babe. This is really weird.”\n\n“I know. I don’t either,” I said.\n\n“Hmm, maybe just come to the lake anyway? I don’t think it’s safe for you to be alone at home.”\n\n“Yeah. Yeah, that’s smart. I’ll be there in thirty.”\n\nWhen I exited my house, I audibly cursed.\n\n“Goddamn it!”\n\nLo and behold, there was a gray, 1987 Honda Accord being towed away. Right in front of my house.\n\n“Oh Nick, was that your car?” I looked over to see my neighbor, Mrs. Jensen, watching from her yard.\n\n“No.” I said it a little harshly, I could see a bit of shock in her face. “Sorry, I mean - no, I don’t know whose car that is. Did you see the driver?”\n\n“Mm, no, he’s in the tow truck now. I just heard the loud bang and I got dressed before I came out here.” She looked concerned too; everyone knew something was off.\n\nI paused, considering if I really wanted to say the next words to come out of my mouth. “I think he’s been following me.”\n\nHer eyes widened, lowering her coffee cup. “Have you told the police? That’s serious, Nick!”\n\n“No, I - I know, I just wasn’t sure until today.”\n\nShe shook her head. “No no, Nicky, we don’t want you in trouble. This neighborhood’s too special for something to happen.”\n\nI sighed once again. “I’m getting out of town, safe and away. I’ll see what I can do.”\n\n“Stay safe.”\n\nI felt like a wet blanket the whole lake trip. Everyone else was in the water, grilling in the backyard, playing games in the sand, but I hid in one of the guest rooms. Amanda would’ve stayed with me, but I forced her to interact with her nieces and nephews so she could somewhat enjoy her vacation. I didn’t know what to do. I would sound insane if I told anyone other than my girlfriend and neighbor, and even then I wasn’t sure I didn’t. Most of my afternoon was spent researching forms of stalking victims, and what happened to spam callers. Nothing on the latter end came up, until I was four pages deep in Google, on an obscure corner of a website that hadn’t been updated since the early 2010s. \n\nMarch 17, 2018\n\n*Anonymous: they followed me.*\n\n*Jellena69: what do u mean?*\n\n*Anonymous: they came to my house. I answered their call, and the followed me, and they made me miserable until I moved*\n\nMy stomach sank again. Moved?\n\n*Jellena69: did u tell them where u lived?*\n\n*Anonymous: no. they figured it out*\n\n*Jellena69: ur car?*\n\n*Anonymous: no.*\n\n*Jellena69: that’s fucked up dude*\n\nI shut my laptop. In the dark room, I flopped down onto the bed and stared at the ceiling, reeling from what I had just read. Surely, surely it wouldn’t get that bad. It was more than a coincidence, I knew that - but to uproot my entire life for a prank call? Was I in purgatory for tweens?\n\nAmanda came back up before dinner. “You should at least try to eat.”\n\nI flipped over, and sat up. I knew that wasn’t my fight to lose. During dinner, I forced smiles and chatted when prompted. Amanda was once again concerned, but relieved that I came down at all. When dessert was over, I watched one episode of Jeopardy! with the family and retreated to my cave.\n\nAmanda told me to lie on the bed, face down.\n\nI raised my eyebrows. “What are you going to do to me?”\n\nShe rolled her eyes, but wasn’t truly annoyed. “I’m going to help you relax a little. Distract you, maybe.”\n\nI complied, and she started massaging my back. It was more pleasant than I anticipated, and I found the tension leaving me as she worked. After a while, she volunteered to put on a show. She grabbed my laptop, and after she put in my password, I heard a gasp.\n\nI propped myself on my elbows, looking backwards. “What is it, babe?” All of a sudden, I remembered the message board I had found. “Oh - I don’t think it’s gonna get that bad.”\n\n“It got that bad for this guy! What if that happens to you? What if it’s worse?” Amanda was trying to be quiet for the sake of her family, but her voice had genuine distress.\n\n“I know, I know, but we’ll figure something out!”\n\nShe put her face in her hands, pushing her hair out of her face. “Oh god.”\n\nBack home, I tried the stupidest thing yet. My brother was driving down to stay with me for a couple nights; I told him about my problem and he was equally worried. I had hours to kill, though, and I didn’t want to be the one killed. I didn’t even know if it was that serious, but I didn’t want to take that risk. Still, I didn’t know what to expect. I found the call in my call logs, dated May 9th. I tapped it, and listened to the dial tone. Right before it hit the answering machine, a woman’s voice answered. She sounded different, though - rougher, not like the woman who I spoke to originally.\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Hi, are you uh, are you with the car warranty guys?”\n\n“Is this a fucking joke? I swear to god -”\n\n“No! No, it’s not a joke. I got a call asking about my car’s warranty and I think I messed up, I don’t want it anymore.”\n\n“Well, you have the wrong goddamn number, don’t call me back.”\n\nThe line went dead. I sat in shock for a moment. Of course they wouldn’t use a traceable phone number. Maybe the gruff woman was a rouse, but no, despite the situation, that was truly far-fetched. She was genuinely pissed.\n\nI leaned back into my chair, contemplating what was next. My brother arrived when he promised, and naturally, nothing happened when he was there either. No incident, he housesat, put up a ring camera, and helped me regroup.\n\nThree nights later, I had the worst encounter yet. After a long day of work, I sat alone on my bed. Amanda had been checking in, but she was on a work trip, and my brother had driven to his home. I heard a noise outside, and glanced curiously over. I peered through my blinds, and almost screamed. The car was parked under a street light across from my house. This was brazen. Clear view, lighting, everything - but the windows were tinted too much to see the driver. Even the car accident, taunting me through the mail - that I could almost handle. But here, alone, in my house, I had no way of protecting myself. No dog with biting teeth, no gun, barely a set of kitchen knives. “Shit,” I whispered.\n\nMy resolve was strengthening. I dialed 911, slipping away from the window.\n\n“Hello, this is 911. What is your emergency?”\n\n“Hi, there’s a man who’s following me. He is outside my house.”\n\n“Okay sir, may I have your address? Have you reported this man before?”\n\n“No prior reports, no, and uh yeah, I live on 1461 Chestnut Place.” Right as I finished, I heard a loud bang on my door. I sucked in my breath. My doors were locked, but it was a small consolation. “I think he’s at my door.”\n\n“Sending officers now. Would you like to stay on the line, sir?”\n\n“Yes please.”\n\nWe talked, with the operator calmly asking me questions to ground me. “Five minutes, sir.”\n\nAnother loud bang hit my front door, and I jumped. I was barricading my bedroom door, with plans to lock myself in the master bathroom once it was secure. “Shit!”\n\n“The officers are approaching, sir, stay calm.”\n\nA softer, but still assertive knock hit my door after a few moments. “Police.”\n\nI cautiously looked through the peephole, seeing two uniformed officers on my doorstep. Opening the door, they looked inside, past me.\n\n“Hello, sir, we got a report of a suspicious figure outside of your house.”\n\n“Yes, officers, he was outside just now. He drives a 1987 Honda Accord and I don’t know what he wants with me, but he’s been following me.”\n\nAn officer raised an eyebrow. “That car matches the description of a car that broke down - “\n\n“And was involved in a hit and run fifteen minutes away,” I interjected.\n\n“How did you know about that, sir?”\n\n“He hit my girlfriend’s car.”\n\nThe two men looked at each other.\n\n“So he’s pursuing you and your girlfriend.”\n\n“Sort of - mostly me, but I don’t know if she’s safe, either.”\n\nOne of them nodded, and guided me out.\n\n“Please come with us sir, I don’t think it’s safe for you to spend the night.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“There’s no one here.”",

        "text": "At one point in everyone’s life, we check for monsters under the bed. As a kid, when something goes bump in the middle of the night, it’s straight to calling mom or dad, or hiding under the sheets.\n\nI used to be one of those kids. Everything about to be revealed took place last night following to now, early in the morning. I only have a minute to write this, whatever the hell it is, it’s violently banging it’s body against the bathroom door, trying to get to me.\n\nI won’t have the same fate as Mitchie.\n\nLast night, I was tucking my son, Mitch, aka Mitchie, into bed. He’s 6 years old, and a ball of energy with a hyperactive imagination.\n\nAfter reading him his bedtime story, he asked me to check for monsters under his bed. I, amused, got on my knees to look under his bed. There was nothing there. Suddenly, a scratching, long and drawn out, just one slow scratch down the closet door. I exchanged looks with my son, he was visibly scared. I tried to hide my fear from him. “No monsters under here, but if you’re still scared, you can come sleep in my bed.” I told him, motioning a panicked hand shuffling to the door.\n\nHe tearfully said okay, and I took his hand to walk out of the room with me. After we were outside, I closed his door, picked him up, and rushed to my bedroom.\n\nI opened my own closet door, no thing, whatever that just was, in it. I quietly pushed back a stack of shoeboxes to the side, and tucked my son into the gap. I hid him using the shoeboxes and pulled over some hung up clothes to cover the rest. \n\nI ran to grab my phone off of the charger and go into the attached bathroom, shut the door so my son wouldn’t hear and get scared, and call the police.\n\nI guess my running was a bad idea. I called the cops, they said they were sending 2 nearby cars there, but they weren’t gonna be here for 5 more minutes, and I hung up. As I did so, I heard my door burst open.\n\nShit. I didn’t lock it, why didn’t I lock it?!\n\nI panicked and locked the door. I prayed my son was safe. I heard faint whimpers from right outside the door. My son. He was right outside the door. Right in that closet. Whatever that thing is, it’s here. It can *hear* him too.\n\nThe closet door is slowly creaked open by that thing. I hear screams. Bones cracking. Blood splattering. I cried an accidental sob.\n\nThen nothing. It was dead silent. \n\nI knew I was next, slow footsteps, and then the next moment there it was, banging on the door. This is where I am now. The monster is now banging it’s full, inhuman body weight into the door, the creature broke a small bit of wood off of the bottom corner where I can see it’s messed up claws. Claws, sharp, blood coated, inhuman, not animal, massive, claws.\n\nThis is where it ends, I’m not gonna make it.",

        "text": "I came up with the idea for the Long Ride a few days ago. My friends and I had met up on Friday evening to hang out, share some stories, and, of course, to have a few beers.\n\nBefore long, I ended up completely plastered. As I sat there, trying my best to not fall off my chair, my friend said something that got the gears in my brain turning, albeit slowly.\n\n“I’m sure I can do it,” I brought out drunkenly.\n\n“Do what?” one of my friends, Alex, asked, turning to me.\n\n“What that Punchy guy did, the thing Derek just mentioned, about riding the subway back and forth.”\n\n“It’s Pynchon, dude,” Derek corrected me with a sigh. “And he didn’t do it. He just wrote about it in one of his books.”\n\n“Yeah, whatever, but I’m sure I can do it, too! And I can do it for an entire week,” I slurred.\n\n“The hell you even talking about?”\n\n“Riding the tram back and forth without getting off,” I said.\n\n“Why’d you even do that?”\n\n“Because I fucking can!”\n\n“This has got to be the dumbest thing you ever came up with...” Derek mumbled.\n\n\\---\n\nThat’s how it started. The next I woke up with a head-splitting headache and utterly hungover, but, of course, I remembered what I’d said, and, of course, I was set on doing it.\n\nWhen I hit up my friends via WhatsApp and told them I was going to do it, they were less than enthusiastic, and didn’t even seem to care.\n\nI was, however, and I spent the rest of the weekend getting ready for the Long Ride. I’d spend an entire week on the tram without getting off!\n\nWell, almost getting off, I thought, and came up with a simple set of rules, which I promptly shared with my friends in a newly created WhatsApp group.\n\nFirst, no getting off the tram, not to go home, and not to get supplies. The only exception was to go to the toilet, which I only allowed myself to do at one specific station.\n\nI also told my friends I’d update them with a short video every hour, so they’d know I was still on the tram.\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more I realized how right my friends were. This really was the dumbest thing I’d ever come up with. Yet I was also very, very excited about what might happen.\n\nAfter what happened today, what I saw, and what else I might see over the course of this week, I decided to share this journey with you guys.\n\n\\---\n\nThis morning, at 8am I entered my tram line of choice, line 4. It was by far the single longest line, going from one end of the city, all the way to the other, a single one-way trip lasting roughly an hour and a half.\n\nI also made sure to come prepared and stocked up on pretty much anything I might need. I’d gotten my Kindle ready, a couple of books, three fully charged power banks, enough food and water to hopefully last me a week, and a single change of clothes just in case. All of this, I’d put away in a gigantic camping backpack half the size of a person.\n\nIn the early morning, the city’s trams are a crowded hell, filled to the brim with people going to work and students on their way to school and university.\n\nHaving been lucky enough, I found myself a seat and settled down with my giant backpack. Then I put in my headphones and blasted music into my ear to drown out the general bustle around me.\n\nThat morning, nothing strange happened, and I was quite happy when the tram grew emptier, and more people got off until only a dozen remained.\n\nFor the first time in a long while, I actually looked at my surroundings, the city, and the other people on the tram. Usually, I was occupied with my phone or my Kindle.\n\nYet the first hours of the Long Ride went by relatively uneventfully.\n\nThe only thing of note that happened was that an older lady sat down near me when I took out one of the many sandwiches I’d prepared for myself. She ranted on and on how I wasn’t allowed to eat on the tram, and pointed at a row of prohibition signs above us.\n\nI simply ignored her and continued eating with a slight grin on my face. Before long, she left me be, shaking her head and went away shaking her head and cursing how us ‘young people don’t know no manners anymore.’\n\nYea, fuck you too, lady.\n\nShe was on the tram for another half hour and for the entire duration, she stared daggers at me. Yet she at least didn’t follow through on her promise to inform the driver and have me kicked off. That would’ve been a rather anticlimactic ending to the Long Ride, I thought, laughing.\n\nThe first truly strange thing, and the reason I’m posting this happened in the afternoon. Even now, though, as I’m typing this out, I’m not sure what I saw.\n\nIn the afternoon, the tram filled with people once more. Some are students from the nearby university, others people getting of work, and of course, children on their way home after a long day at school.\n\nOne group in particular caught my interest. It was a group comprising seven kids, a loud group. They were laughing, yelling at each other, blasting music, and jumping around.\n\nI hated them.\n\nAs I watched them with growing disdain, I noticed that two of them looked exactly the same. Brothers, I reasoned, most likely twins.\n\nThe behavior of the two, however, couldn’t have been more different.\n\nOne of them was as energetic as the rest while the other just stood there, not moving at all, watching the rest, who seemed to ignore him entirely.\n\nAt first I thought nothing of it, but the longer I watched him, the stranger the whole thing felt. Then slowly, ever so slowly, the child’s face grew from a dejected, uninterested look to a grin, an almost hungry grin, one directed at his brother.\n\nThis went on for almost fifteen minutes. His friends never noticed his weird behavior, and similarly the child never noticed me staring. As much as I told myself he was just a child being a child, I couldn’t help but find the entire situation weird, surreal, even.\n\nThat face-splitting grin. It wasn’t normal. This wasn’t what a child should look like. Hell, could look like!\n\nI leaned forward, took out my phone and was about to take a picture when the tram came to a halt. Amongst the general bustle, I lost track of the kids who left the tram amongst a multitude of other people.\n\nEventually I saw them again, outside at the station. I noticed something right away. By now, there were only six of them, not seven.\n\nOne of the brothers, the twins, was gone. The other just stood out there next to his group of friends, not doing anything.\n\nA second later, the tram doors closed. In that instant, the kid’s head jerked in my direction. His eyes were wide, his face still distorted by the same twisted grin, and he was staring right at me, and only me. And then, he opened his mouth, wider than should be possible, and jumped forward, as if to throw himself through the glass.\n\nI cringed back in terror, away from the window, almost toppling over my backpack and sending a handful of supplies onto the floor of the tram. Within moments, and thanks to a few helpful other passengers, I was quick to pick everything up.\n\nWhen I stared back, however, the kid was gone, and was now hurrying after his group of friends, seemingly without a care in the world.\n\nEven now, I don’t know what to make of this. I told myself he was just being a kid, just being stupid after he’d noticed me staring at him. That face, however, that mouth...\n\nThe thing that has me most worried, however, was the number of kids. I knew there had been seven before, and only six of them got off.\n\nFor long minutes, I scanned the interior of the tram, trying to find the missing kid and to see if he’d stayed behind on his own. Yet there was no hint of him. He seemed to have vanished.\n\nThe general bustle of the day soon evened out as afternoon turned into evening. Then picked up once more when people set out to hit the bars, or to meet up with friends.\n\nI nodded off at about eleven in the evening.\n\nI was jerked awake long past two in the morning when I was almost pulled off my seat. When I opened my eyes, I found myself face to face with some asshole who’d tried to take a hold of my backpack.\n\nYet I was no idiot. Before I’d gone to sleep, I’d made sure to carefully wrap the backpack’s strap around my arm.\n\nFor a few seconds, the guy just stared at me, a dumbfounded look on his face before he realized what was going on. A moment later, when the tram came to a stop, he rushed away and outside.\n\nI could only stare at him. The fucker had just tried to steal my shit.\n\nAfter he was gone, I checked the backpack’s contents to make sure none of them were gone.\n\nThen I took out my phone and typed this all out. And now, I’m just sitting here, trying to catch some sleep.\n\nIf I witness any other strange things, or something else of interest happens, [I’ll keep you all updated.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=UpdateMeBot&amp;subject=Subscribe&amp;message=SubscribeMe!%20%2Fr%2Fnosleep%20%2Fu%2FRehnWriter)\n\n[YT](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXKQbQnB1k_FTnTMyNudIFA/)\n\n[WS](https://rehnwriter.com/)",

        "text": " My wife Mercedes travels a few times a year for business, and she’d always bring me back a souvenir of some sort: a corny t-shirt, a magnet, a keychain. But on this last trip, she brought back something else entirely and it’s ruined our marriage – if not our lives.\n\nWe’ve been together for almost two decades, but our routine after she returned from a trip was always the same. I’d meet her the airport, she’d text when she landed, and give me a running hug in the baggage claim. I’d try to help her with her bag, which she always refused, even when it weighed more than she does. We’d share everything we did in our days apart, from the exciting to the mundane.\n\nThis last time was different. She’d called me the night before her flight, we exchanged the normal ‘I love you’s, but that was last normal thing that’s occurred in my life since.\n\nShe never texted me that she’d made it in. I was at the baggage claim, people had already gathered, bags were coming out, but Mercedes just wasn’t there.\n\nI waited, I texted, I called. Nothing.\n\nWith every moment that went by, I grew more and more worried – At first, I wondered if she’d never actually made it to the airport, but saw her baby blue suitcase slowly circle by.\n\nUnsure of what else to do, I kept calling, until I finally heard her ringtone coming from nearby, audible over the conversations and whirring of machinery now that most people had cleared out. That’s when I noticed her for the first time.\n\nShe’d been on the other side of the machine the entire time, but she was unrecognizable. As I approached her, she looked past me, as if I were a stranger. Her hair was messy and matted to her face, her clothes were stained and she had rough and jagged cuts at the corners of her mouth, bruises beginning to bloom across her jaw.\n\nShe stared emotionlessly into the distance as her bag passed by us multiple times; didn’t even comment when I finally grabbed it.\n\nIn the privacy of our car I tried to ask if she was okay, what had happened – clearly something was wrong – but on her end the ride home was silent. Pierced only by a wet sounding cough she’d developed.\n\nFor a while after we returned home, she seemed better and more like herself. There would be those rough moments when she’d fall back into that confused and disheveled state, but they were brief.\n\nAs time went on, though, the lapses became longer. We’d be mid conversation – she’d be mid laugh when her face would go slack, she was gone again.\n\nEventually, she’d wander around as if lost in our own home – she would forget where she was and who I was. I’d even seen her stare up at the ceiling for hours at a time. She stopped eating, but she still looked healthy enough.\n\nI called our doctor and he was as concerned as I was, but she absolutely refused to go see him.\n\nEvery few nights since she’s been home, like clockwork, Mercedes leaves the house and slides out into the darkness. Any time I would bring it up, if she was even aware enough to register my words, it’d result in an argument – she still straight up denies that she’s even leaving at all, but our video doorbell says otherwise.\n\nAnd that terrifies me, because of the deaths that have begun plaguing our town.\n\nThe first body was found two weeks ago. My buddy Ron’s wife is a police officer and told me he heard it almost looked like an animal attack based on the sheer brutality.\n\nIt wasn’t long before the old Mercedes – my Mercedes – was gone entirely. She’d have the occasional moment where she seemed to recognize me, but there was no longer any of her gentleness or humor left behind those eyes. Instead, in the rare moments of clarity, I felt as if observed by a predator calculating their next move.\n\nNot long after, her boss called the house because she had stopped showing up to work entirely – it sounded like she wasn’t the even only one of her coworkers to do so.\n\nSince then, she’s only gotten worse. On top of her deteriorating psychological state, her physical health hasn’t improved either – in fact, she’s begun coughing up concerning things, like writhing long strips of something, and bits of cloth and hair.\n\nAnd teeth. I don’t think they were her own, either.\n\nI think I finally found out where she’s going and who she’s with, and it’s worse than I ever could have imagined.\n\nAbout a week ago, I awoke gasping, struggling to catch my breath. Mercedes was kneeling on my chest, prying my mouth open with both hands with such ferocity that I kept expecting to hear a sickening crack. She stared at me with a purposeful and intense focus, eyes wild and dilated, only inches from my own. I remember feeling waves of searing pain, almost as if something was boring its way through my soft palate.\n\nI tried telling myself it was just a vivid nightmare, but my jaw ached so much the next morning, and I’ve developed a headache since then that still hasn’t gone away.\n\nOur marriage has been falling apart and the situation in town has gone from bad to worse, too.\n\nThey found another body in the park near our home just a few days ago. Ron told me he heard that they’d ruled out a robbery – the victim was still wearing her diamond earrings – well one at least, on the half of her head that wasn’t missing – and clutching a purse that was full of cash.\n\nI’m starting to wonder if they’ll even solve any of these cases. The last time I saw Ron’s wife in town, in a departure from her usual friendly nature, she walked right past me with a now familiar look of detached vacancy on her face.\n\nIf that weren’t bad enough, I don’t even have my health – I think whatever Mercedes has, I’ve caught it too. I can’t shake the feeling that there’s something wet lodged deep within in my lungs that I can’t get out, sometimes I even swear it feels like it’s moving. The coughing, coupled with the searing pain at the base of my skull has made the past week unbearable.\n\nAccording to our doorbell footage, I’ve recently joined Mercedes when she leaves at night, but I don’t remember a single moment of it. I realized I’m losing track of hours at a time.\n\nOur daughter Fallon came home for a few days during spring break recently – I could’ve sworn I told her not to come, that her mom and I were sick and I didn’t want her to catch it – but she told me I called non-stop and that I actually *begged* her to come home and see us.\n\nBefore she went back to her shared dorm room, she had begun acting oddly – walking around looking dazed, and started to develop the same cough as her mom and I.\n\nNow that I think I’ve found out what my wife is doing at night, I’m terrified of the thought of what will happen now that my daughter has just returned to a college campus packed with people.\n\nThere’s something else that scares me too, that I haven’t told anyone else.\n\nThis morning, I finally thought I was getting better when I managed to cough something up – but then I saw what it was.\n\nLong squirming things. And a single ornate diamond stud earring.\n\nI know something is terribly wrong, but I don’t know what to do about [it.](https://www.reddit.com/user/JamFranz/comments/11or7ez/hello_and_welcome/)",

        "text": "From until months after this occurrence I had lived on a farm, a nice secluded self sustaining plot of land worthy of a human life to exist in. On days in which I wasn't tending to the animals, structures, or plants of the farm I was exploring the limitless land that walled off my farm from most, people whom saw nothing in the expanse of grass and hills. Many times on my journeys of needless exploring I would see a shimmer of light coming to my sense of sight, almost blinding me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGlass was the only thing I could think of that would cause a reflection of the sun so powerful it bathed in the power of the sun itself, a strange thing to be behold as a large hill fell below the reflection. Meaning it needed to have to been a building of glass tall enough to survey well above the confines of the hill. Over and over I glazed over the reflection, casting doubt that I would want to see the lords of capitalism mow over was once was a  paradise of my farm and endless expanse of bright green grass. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd so I had ignored the reflection for years, but eventually my needless curiosity overcame me one day. The day had already started itself unfortunate, building its paranoia and despair to me when one of my cows had died. Suffering from the loss of good cattle I needed an escape from the day so far. Later I could deal with it thoroughly. I was staring at above, searching for a deal of satisfaction, at least for a short sprint of satisfaction for now. And that's when the reflection of the monarchs building caught my eye. I needed to see at last what the monarchs had planned for my land. It wasn't going to be a happy conclusion but a distraction nonetheless. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTrudging towards the hill, my shoes wetting from the rain forming mud of the grasslands yesterday. From the hill I walked in dangerous curiosity, and saw a abominable sight. A large artificial pyramid building laid upon my sights. It had forcibly rooted out the grass around it, having only mud surrounding it. The building covered in opac glass only had one entrance that my eyes could detect.  It was a large steel door covered in vines, an entrance seemingly impossible for me to prance on. Moments grazed by as I stared at the monarchs pyramid. I had lost track of time when the sound of metal loudly screeched to move. The door was moving, slowly it was consumed by the left of the wall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom the inside of the building a man in a lab coat desperately ran out.  Despite my greatest attempts, the sight of the man covered in blood revealed itself to my eyes. He only ran a few feet out the door before coughing up his own red lining and falling over on his own knees. A trail of red was before him. Everything in me pleaded home. But from me trying to look away from the now presumingly deceased corpse I had spotted a figure inside the building.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI couldn't look away from the thing lurking on the side of the stairway railing. It was a mountain lion drenched in blood, its eyes retching with nothing, yet at the same time pulsing with malice. Its mouth hung agar, its saliva causing a pool on the floor. The thing was in an advanced stage of rabies. Or at least a disease that was near rabies. I had once found a rat with rabies but it wasn't as pronounced as this.  And the thing. It turned its head up to the ceiling and created a horrible sound. It was a roar of many screams - voices pleading for help, distorted by the  creatures lungs so much that the words were incomprehensible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe creature turned it head down and to the side. Giving me a look of evil curiosity. And before long it ran away in a twisted prance to the right of somewhere. My body was frozen for what felt like a while. Thoughts storming in my head, one preposterous thought overpowered all that was reasonable. The thought overpowered even my nervous system. The thought was the idea of finding the reason of these occurrences. An idiotic thought I know, but.... I wasn't thinking normally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIrrationally my body started to move toward the pyramid's abyss. After many grueling moments  I was inside the pyramid. My mind could now see a slight amount of shed remains from the desensitization of it all, but it still wasn't enough to protect my undigested food from erupting after seeing the gore that the screamer's prowl had commenced. Organs, limbs, intestines. So much in such little time.  My eyes and nose watered from the aura of death. My legs and mind were different from each other at the time. I was trying not to faint from the sights, and the legs were shifting towards the stairs that split in the middle of what was I assumed to be the main waiting room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGagging all the way through the stairs, I and the legs reached the top of the stairs. Bloodshed was thorough everywhere the sights of my now barely functioning eyes could muster to see, but at least there weren't fresh corpses in sight now. Three doors on the left, middle, and right of me revealed a decision for me. If I were to continue this fruitless endeavor, where would I go? Signs were placed slightly above the doors. My eyes were now starting to function well enough for me to read that the middle was to the security offices, that the left was for the storage unit, and the right was for the laboratory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStruggling to keep my mind at a rate good enough to decide, I stood there silently weighing my options. The storage unit may have cognition for what this place was but so could the laboratory. Though the laboratory was most likely the origin for the mountain screamer so it may have been the best not to stride in. Lastly, the security offices. They might have information, they may have weapons and or survivors and a way of finding emergency services. It may have been obvious from the start, but it was always going to be the security offices weighing over the others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd so, I drifted my way towards the opened doors of the security offices. The blood wasn't as indecent as the waiting room but the many branching corridors with zero direction were tolling on me. Every direction looked the exact same and ended with the same windowless door. Blindly, I went trudged my way into the middle door of an intersection. There was no reasoning anymore. As I walked the long corridor noises started to emit from behind me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was a drip of a liquid, the slight wisp of breath, and a soft pad of feet. Paws. With adrenaline lining my systems, I bolted down the corridor before hearing the screamer emit its blood curdling scream once again and give chase to me. Its paws edged on the floor, getting louder everytime I heard it land again. Every single shred of power in me wedged itself into my calves yet I could still feel the screamer gaining incredible distance between me. I was now reaching for the end of the corridor and striving to get around the corner which ended this despairing tunnel. Almost slipping on my heels I rounded the corner and saw a savior of metal rise in my vision to rescue me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA metal door was weaseled between the two walls of the short corridor and my eyes greeted me to a sign laying above the door, \" Security office 3, main. \". The painful bolt to the office door was thankfully brief and I was already opening the door when I could hear the screamer thumping its body into the wall from rounding the corner so quickly.  It was a matter of a couple precious seconds if the screamer was going to maul me. I opened the door just wide enough for my body to wedge through and attempted to quickly dispatch of the existence of the opening. But the screamer had finished its stride to the door was now pawing at the small opening of which I was now exhaustingly failing to close with all my might.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe screamer's malicious power was starting to overthrow my will to live when I had a sudden burst of adrenaline and kicked one of the murderous paws away with my almost depleted foot. The outcome of this kick resulted in the screamer losing the upper hand and letting the chance of the opening to fizzle out entirely. Now the door was closed and I was safe. Safe in this standalone door with only one chamber to get into. When I slowly turned my body around I could see a room filled with nobody but the room itself and me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo blood was in sight, no grizzly corpses around and no severed limbs, and there weapons of safety, ones that could dispatch any animal within seconds, displayed on wide open shelves encasing the walls leading to the middle of the room. Of which a couple desks, chairs and big monitors were shown. This assured me that I was surely now safe, a room I could wait in till. Till when? I had an estimate of where the screamer would be due to the monitors displaying some of the rooms and corridors of this place, but I would to damned to luck due to the screamer eventually hearing me with how long it took to get from the mouth of the building to this safe space.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSadly, I was trapped. And a sight of something made me realize just how trapped I was. On one of the monitors displayed the first corridor of the security offices. Of which I saw men. Running men in what looked like swat team apparels. I knew what the purpose of them were, they were here to dispose of the screamer. And me. Whatever ruled this building and the team of men heading to my location would surely not want loose ends. And they knew of my location because a camera lay in the corner of the room I squatted in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took a weapon of untrustworthy protection with me. Though I knew it wasn't going to save me from a team of trained personal, I needed a way of killing the screamer. I had a plan,  a plan to hide in the janitors room I had passed while on the intersection. The metal door fumbled open and I ran towards the short corridor, ready to brace the corner and fight against time.  The corner flew past me as I chambered my pains away to fight the clock of the long corridor. Slowly my pains escaped and weighed me down, slowing me down. I couldn't slow down now. I couldn't slow down now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithout notice of my prior visions I saw the door of the corridor in reach of me, and I tore it open, almost fumbling down on my knees in the process. I spat and the ground and continued to harm my legs by running further, speed still capped down from its prior peak. I was so close to the janitor room, it was the left option of the intersection. And so I rounded the corner, into the short corridor and slammed myself against the door of the janitors room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was in. I had pushed myself my knees before hearing the sounds of loud anchored steps of a steel toed team. And that's when I realized my idiotic mistake. I couldn't hide here. I could have never hid here because there would be a camera that would stream my location to a individual that would call out my location into the helmets of the team. I quietly laughed with the tears that crawled down my face. My head was in my arms when the pounding of steps got quieter. They slowly fizzled out and flooded my mind in with relief.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA moment later and my head was looking up at the room. Closets lay about for storage and benches were around but not a single camera. A miracle helped me live. They for some reason passed over the opportunity to have a camera in the janitors room. Flourishing in relief I stood up and pushed open the door. I only had a couple short corridors left to leave this godforsaken place. Though in my haste I had left an item of protection behind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe corridor passed me as I ran out of it and round the corner. The next corridor lead to nothing, my legs somehow now at full capacity of speed. The next short corridor also lead to the success, as I ended my rally of running and pushed open the now closed doors of the corridor leading to the entrance room. The entrance room leading to....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I flung myself to the top of the entrance room a fearful sight worked its way into me. The screamer was to the left of me. It growled at me before screaming loudly. It was so close that one quick pounce could end me. I stared intently at the screamer before it crawled down to the floor and looked up at me. In less than a second it pounced at me and I, reacting before the sight of him moving reached my brain, lounged to the direction of the glass railing and with all of the force of my body, and broke the glass railing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a milla second I was falling. For the next I was hanging onto the ledge. There was a slight amount of concrete that remained away from the railing that hung me. My fingers ached for holding the mass of my body for even the moment before the screamer once again rung its fear inducing scream, this time it felt that it was filled with anger. A couple moments later and my finger ached longer, my panic starting to rise seeing no way of getting out of this situation lest I attempt to crawl away with broken legs or a concussion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was until loud explosions rung in the building. No not explosions, they just sounded like them in the quiet yet panicked moments of me hanging. They were in fact gunshots, running from what I presumed was the team  disposing of the pure evil of the screamer. \" Target 3 down \" I heard one of the team members say. A second later and I heard them exiting to what I assumed to be the storage unit corridor, as I heard doors fling open and their steps getting quieter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow all I had to do was climb back up, easier said than done. It took so much energy that I didn't have to lift myself onto stable ground again. The first try I attempted only lead to a depletion of valuable energy, the second causing the same outcome. I started to panic, thinking that I couldn't possibly rise up before the team got me. But that panic was the cause of the last of my adrenaline. And that small sliver of adrenaline was enough to lift me up onto stable ground.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI laid there, panting as I looked up at the grey concrete ceiling. I was free. I didn't realize I was walking  outside the building until I felt the vines of grass touch my legs. The walk was long yet untiring and peaceful. When I was on the hill that separated my home from the hellish building, I stared at the pyramid. It looked back at me, in a way that felt as if it was agitated that I escaped unharmed.....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently I started hearing noises outside my house, noises of a large animal of sorts. This field doesn't  tend to have animals large enough to create sounds that loud, so I was fearful when I investigated it. With a flashlight in hand I stepped outside and created a beam of light to see anything of notice. Far away in the distance I could see a bear, and it could see me. A large grizzly bear with a wide open mouth. I hope its open mouth wasn't open to let out saliva, for that would strike the failure of the pyramids owners, the failure of humanity. I haven't seen the bear since but I have heard it. I had moved away as quickly as I could accomplish, in hopes that I can escape this thing. But like rabies, this bear can spread its malice. For I have seen animals start to act more aggressive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I even saw one foaming at the mouth.",

        "text": " Amber hoped it was her imagination, but it seemed unnaturally dark out tonight, even with the moon nearly full overhead. This close to the city, there were almost no stars, clouds gliding silently through the night like shreds of cotton dipped in ash. She scooted as close to the crackling fire as she could without toppling off the log she and Chelsea were sitting on, hating the smiles that had come over her brothers’ faces. Their parents had had to go out of town yet again, leaving the boys in charge of her and their cousin.\n\nThe skidding growl of a revving engine snapped through the night, echoing like thunder across the valley. Chelsea pressed herself up against Amber’s side, the girls clutching each other fearfully while James just laughed.\n\n“Guess I don’t have to ask if you two heard that,” he commented with a smirk, then he shrugged carelessly. “It was probably just the drag racing that happens every weekend, though, nothing to be scared of. Although…”\n\nHe rubbed his chin thoughtfully. A patchy beard had started growing in, and he drew attention to it whenever he could.\n\n“Ah, forget it,” he said at last, plucking a marshmallow from the bag beside him. “You two already look like you’re about to piss yourselves, no point in scaring you more.”\n\nHe glanced at Tommy, then speared his marshmallow on a red-handled toasting stick. The color stood out like fresh blood against his dark skin.\n\n“S-Scare us about what,” Chelsea ventured, her arms shaking like her voice. “W-What are you talking about?”\n\nAmber didn’t like the look that crossed Tommy’s face, but then she never had.\n\n“We really should tell them, bro,” he told James. “How else will they know what to look out for?”\n\nJames simply watched his marshmallow, slowly turning it just above the flames. He pulled it away when it was a crispy golden brown, letting the passing breeze cool it before biting into the gooey treat.\n\n“Yeah, I guess you’re right. We can’t let them wander around if they don’t know the danger.”\n\n“*What* danger?” Amber demanded. She had always hated it when the two played those games, it never led to anything but trouble. “Come on, you two, spit it out!”\n\nTommy opened one of their Hershey’s bars and began breaking it into squares, dropping them in a cup buried to the rim in ice in the small cooler on the log between them.\n\n“We just mean Old Cutthroat Jones,” he started mysteriously. “You guys don’t know that story?”\n\nChelsea shook her head fast, strands of her wild black hair getting caught in Amber’s mouth. Tommy chuckled, stuck the empty wrapper in his pocket and leaned forward.\n\n“Well, Carl Jones was a psychopath back in the sixties. He practically grew up in the insane asylums that were everywhere back then, at least until they were all closed down. The last time anyone remembered seeing him was a few weeks before Christmas in 1970, when he left on a motorcycle ride.”\n\nHe grabbed some sticks from their kindling pile, sparks flying as he tossed them in the flames, then stirred up the charcoal with a broken branch.\n\n“He spent every night that winter hiding in the woods all along this very road,” he pointed to the old highway they had followed to the campsite. Though James’ bright orange Camero was right next to their tent, it had never looked so far away. “Waiting for cars to stop. Of course, they had to, since he rigged up spike strips with nails and rope to pop their tires. If they were adults, or families with little kids, he let them go, but not without leaving a sign that it was no accident. Of course, the police could never prove anything about them.”\n\nHe grabbed a graham cracker from the box by his feet and broke it neatly in half.\n\n“The teenagers, though? Well, they were lucky if they made it back in their cars alive. No one knows why he targeted them, maybe it was because of all the girls who rejected him, the jocks who bullied him. Whatever the case, the second their backs were turned as they tried to change their tires, he’d snatch them, dragging them by their necks into the woods before anyone else realized what had happened.”\n\nHe set a square of chocolate on one half, and James layered it with another perfect marshmallow. Amber couldn’t help but think the strands of sticky goop trailing off the stick looked like the chicken bones she had soaked in vinegar in science class.\n\n“Like I said, they were lucky if they made it back to the road alive,” he curled his other hand into a hook, the shadow looming wickedly across the girls. “Since it’s said he slashed them until their skin peeled off, and somehow, he was never caught.”\n\nHe set the other half of the cracker on top and smooshed it down, the chocolate oozing like the mud that had likely buried so many helpless victims. The squishy crunch when he bit slowly into the s’more sounded unnaturally sinister.\n\n“The story is that he froze to death when that crazy blizzard hit, the one your class just learned about,” he looked pointedly at Chelsea. “But, since his body was never found, people started believing he was still out there, and that he’d just started making sure the bodies he created were never found, either.”\n\nA dark grin spread across his face, the bits of white fluff stuck to his lips making him look rabid. Amber almost puked from how fast her heart was pounding in the dry back of her throat. She hadn’t realized until then that her mouth was hanging open, and she quickly clamped it shut.\n\n“Of course, he had to die eventually, but everyone knows even that’s not enough to stop pure evil. There are nights, just like tonight, actually, where you can still spot him hiding in the woods, and a lot of families have reported their tires going mysteriously flat, all because of a puncture mark where the nail disappears as soon as they spot it.”\n\nThe silence after stretched on, even the frogs and crickets going still. Then that engine revved again, sounding closer, louder, angrier. The girls screamed, and the fire flared to sudden life, the flames towering before falling back to normal with a crackling hiss. The boys sat there, looking stunned, the angry accusation of their trick dying on Amber’s tongue when she saw the growing spot of blood on Tommy’s chest. He toppled forward, his head cracking on the stones surrounding the flames, his eyes vacant as blood pooled across the damp soil.\n\nThere was a low, guttural noise, and her terrified stare snapped toward her oldest brother. A crimson stream frothed and bubbled from his lips, clouding the tears that spilled down his cheeks. The large, gnarled hand gripping his shoulder shoved him sideways, a rusted hunting knife tearing him open from navel to hip, his intestines spilling out when he hit the dirt.\n\nThe face was broad, far older than any human should be, pale as snow and twisted in a manic glee. He ran a single finger along the stained, dripping blade gripped tightly in his fist, the force of his gaze freezing Amber’s blood. Chelsea screamed again, hugging her so tightly she could barely breathe.\n\n“It’s too bad you girls just turned thirteen.”\n\nThe voice echoed like wind in a canyon, rasping like dead leaves up an empty street. The smile was two rows of rotted, broken teeth like unkempt gravestones.\n\n“Too bad indeed.”",

        "text": "I’ve never lived in one place for long.\n\nAs a kid, me and mom were constantly on the move. It was hard when I was younger because what child doesn’t crave stability?\n\nBut as I aged, it became easier. I grew used to being alone and didn’t bother making friends. There was no point getting close to anybody because, eventually, I would be gone. We made promises to keep in touch, but we never did.\n\nAs an adult, I was free to stay or go, but I always chose the latter. I never wanted to stay in one place too long, so I wandered.\n\nMy mom used to tell me about her childhood home. The grandmother I had never known still lived there. She told me how often she would get lost in the house with its winding staircases, shifting hallways, and dark, windowless rooms.\n\n“The walls talk,” she said, her eyes misty with memory. “They know all your secrets. They can divine your future.”\n\nI laughed. “So, you lived at Hogwarts, mom?”\n\nShe didn’t say anything, and when I looked at her, her eyes were dreamy.\n\nLife seemed to be going my way after I turned thirty. I had a great job in a city I loved, and for the first time in my life, I wanted to stay. I didn’t want to drift anymore.\n\nThen mom disappeared.\n\nI didn’t worry initially because she never stayed in one place for too long. She was still wrapped up in wanderlust. But it was strange because no matter where she was, she would call me at least once a week, but a week passed by, and then three, and I knew something was very wrong.\n\nCall it a hunch, I guess, but I knew she had returned to her childhood home with the shifting staircases and windowless halls.\n\nGrandma still lives there, she told me, and when I asked to meet her, she said no.\n\nNever go to the house, Raquel. She said. Promise me you never will.\n\nNow I was breaking the promise, but what choice did I have?\n\nIt took me months to find the house.\n\nWhen I first saw the house, I almost drove away. I would look for mom someplace else. I would tell the police, and they would help me find her.\n\nBut I couldn’t do that, and nobody can help me.\n\nI knew she was here.\n\nBut how she could be here, I didn’t understand. The state of the home was past dilapidation. It looked like if you breathed on it, it would cave in.\n\nI squinted. What was that?\n\nThere was a figure sitting on a porch swing. Without thinking, I exited my car and walked up the drive. The figure stood up and walked into the crumbling house.\n\nThey left the door open, and darkness billowed out like a cloud.\n\nI walked through the weed-choked yard and glanced at the black and yellow sign lying on the ground.\n\nCONDEMNED\n\nTHIS AREA IS DEEMED UNFIT FOR HUMAN HABITATION\n\nSo they said, but from what I saw, that didn’t appear true.\n\nEyes gazed at me from the doorway, and hands reached out to grab me. I should have run. I could have gotten away! But my feet wouldn’t listen to me. They had a mind of their own.\n\nA woman walked out of the dark. She stooped over, and her face showed signs of great age.\n\nGrandma, I thought, and as if she had heard my thoughts, the woman held her arms out, and I walked towards her embrace.\n\nSomething crunched beneath my boot. I thought it was the bones of a field mouse at first, but as I looked closer, I realized I was stepping on teeth. Teeth connected to a jawbone. A jaw bone that had once been attached to a human.\n\nMom.\n\nI turned to run, but it was too late. My grandmother grabbed me by my arms and dug her nails in.\n\nI shrieked as she punctured my flesh. She ripped out my veins and clawed at my bones.\n\nEverything went black, and I died.\n\nI’m here now; yes, I’m in this fucking house. Grandma is here too, and so is Mom.\n\nI don’t know how much time has passed. I don’t think that matters here.\n\nI hear voices coming from the walls. I’ve seen faces in the mirrors.\n\nI’ve tried breaking down the wall and smashing out the windows.\n\nNothing works; I’m stuck here.\n\nThis is why I’m writing this. Maybe one of you can help me. Please go to [REDACTED] Ash Lane, Lily PA [REDACTED]. Please, look for the house torn apart by age. My car is still there. The license plate is [REDACTED]. I’ll see you. I promise. That’s my face pressed against the window’s glass.\n\nI feel so dumb, and I’m angry. But mostly, I’m scared.\n\nMom told me that Grandma called her home. She told her she was dying, and so mom went.\n\nBut Grandma had died long ago. She wanted company, so she took her daughter and waited for me. She is so happy, and she’ll never be alone again because, in this house, death doesn’t exist.\n\nOnly eternity.",

        "author": "Kolif_Avander",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11qohg1/the_cobblestone_path/",
        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n*This passage is from the journal of a women named Jessica Norton.* \n\nIn my city, the roads stretched themselves throughout the landscape. They went so far that they even passed the mountains that hid our city from the rest. It was said that along this road there was a dirt path that led into the large forest that spread itself along the northern area of the district. The forest had a silver lake that would, at night, dazzle and shimmer, reflecting the moons beauty. Not only that but it was also said that a person lived in these woods inside a log cabin that could only be located by following an archaic cobblestone path that led to the house. The myth was that anyone who made it to the house would never return and those that lived would get lost trying to find it and eventually make their way back to the city. In the myth it was even said that, on a rare occasion, a person would come into the city and murder those who had attempted to find the cabin. Whether this myth was no more than a fake tale told to scare people around a campfire or whether the legends and myths of old were tangible, what I experienced that night was so vivid and abhorrent that it will stay with me until the day I die. \n\nI was twenty-one at the time and I was partaking a multitude of part-time jobs to keep up with my rent. All the jobs I took on were at night as I was in college during the day. Not only that but the night had grown darker in the recent weeks so I could only rely on the streetlamps to navigate my way home. It was around one o’clock in the morning and I was finishing up my shift at a grocery store that I had been working at for a couple of months. My friend, Sarah had come into the store. She did the one to six shifts for the early hours of the morning. Why someone would be getting groceries at one o’clock let alone four or five o’clock I don’t know but I didn’t care either. Sarah unbuttoned her coat and unveiled her scarf that was hiding half of her face. She came over to me and exchanged words for a moment, during which I couldn’t help but feel as though she was on edge about something. While we were talking, I commented on it to see if my intuition was correct. “Well, the thing is maybe I am being paranoid or something, but the thing is I am sure that I saw something lurking outside.” In response to this, I rolled my eyes and said, “It was probably just an animal.” and patted Sarah on the shoulder while chuckling. “Oh, whatever!” Sarah said and I walked out, playfully shaking my head. \n\nThe street was so gloomy that the lamps could barely fight the thick cloak of darkness that choked all crevices of the city. The wind was harsh, lashing at my body from all angles. I hastily put on my coat and made sure that the hood was tight around my head so that I wouldn’t expose myself to the wind's fury. I trekked along the pavement, being faithful to the lamps in the hopes that they would guide me to the bus-stop. It had rained earlier that day and due to this the pavements and roads were slippery. I fell victim to the weather as I slipped on a pool of water, yet I was able to regain my balance by grabbing onto a lamp for support. Due to the shock, it took a while to regain my composure, but I eventually came to my senses. I looked around my environment and behind me in the far distance I could ever so slightly make out a figure that seemed to be hiding in the dark. I tried to focus in on this figure however I soon lost focus of it, and it was lost to the shadows. Shortly after that I felt a distinctive chill that crawled its way up to my spine and made its way to my skull. I could feel a cold sweat beginning to pour down my forehead and my body began to freeze. I slowly gathered myself and continued to walk down the street. \n\nI found myself at a curb and I could see the bright flashing car lights fly past me. I hesitated for a while in fear that, due to the darkness, the cars wouldn’t see me, and I would end up being a red smear all over the road. I eventually got the courage and darted towards the other end of the street. Luckily, I got across unscathed and in one piece. To the left of me, where I would normally go to get the bus, the road was cut off by police. This meant I would have to go a different way to get to the bus-stop, I would have to go into the dark depths of the inner-city. The inner-city was littered with thin alleyways that were encapsulated in darkness. The walls were drenched with a viscous sludge that seemed to be decorated in all areas of the city. There were no lamps that provided some sort of visibility, there was only the moonlight that reflected the large pools of water that had been left by the rain. Luckily, I was prepared and had a flashlight with me. The flashlight, however, did not go far and was quite dim. I navigated around the inner-city, trying to use my memory to figure out where I needed to go. \n\nI made my way to a large courtyard. The courtyard was once a luscious plane of grass that local residents would sit at during the afternoon. However, the courtyard seemed to be barren of any form of greenery and was instead covered in the same viscous sludge that had clung to the walls of the buildings a few moments before. I stood froze at the edge of courtyard, considering whether or not to go across it, when I heard a loud metallic beat of footsteps approaching from behind me. I turned to see a dark figure a close distance away from me. The figure seemed to be approaching swiftly and without a second thought I attempted to dart across the courtyard. However, as I got to a third of the way across, the sludge had wrapped itself around my shoes and I could feel it slowly dragging me in with it. I jumped forward however I fell into the sludge and could feel its darkness attempting to consume me. The orchestra of metallic footsteps grew louder and louder. For what felt like an eternity of wriggling in sludge I eventually tore myself out of its grasp and stumbled out of the courtyard. I turned back and could see the figure now at the beginning of the courtyard, it began to make its way across however seemed to not struggle against the sludge. \n\nI ran with my clothes now tattered from the struggle and headed into one of the thin alleyways in the street. I hid in amongst the rubbish of a garbage can, with my eyes peeking out of its crevice. I could see the moonlight reflecting the figure as it approached towards the alleyway. Its face was a ghostly white that adorned an uncanny grin that exposed all of its rotting teeth. Any other grim details this being may have possessed were hidden by the rim of its large top hat. I heard the footsteps growing even more aggressive as it approached, the hard metal thuds crashing against the fractured pavement below. It came very close to me, so close that I could hear the heavy, demonic breathing of the creature. However, it seemed to not have noticed me hiding and it left taking its orchestra of metal thuds with it. After I could no longer hear its daunting sounds, I stepped out of the garbage bin and carried on towards the bus stop. \n\nI eventually came out of the inner city and was back on the main road. In the distance I could see the bus stop. I darted towards the bus stop, using every ounce of my energy to get there. I had gotten halfway across the street when I started to feel extremely cold and almost instantly I was frozen in place. I could see that the streetlights began to flicker and then popped. After only a few seconds the street was completely pitch black and I started to feel numb.  \n\nAfter, what only felt like a few seconds, I awoke to see large pine trees towering over me. I looked down and I saw a cobblestone path below me that I was being dragged along. I was bound by a thick piece of rope that went from my shoulders to my ankles. I attempted to turn my head to see what I was being dragged by and I could see a tall man wearing a dark black coat who was holding the rope that was wrapped around me. Although my vision was blurred, I could make out a log cabin in the distance that was dimly lit by small lanterns that were decorated randomly across the cabin. \n\nI did not even attempt to struggle as I knew that any efforts would have been futile. I could feel the grime and dirt that had collected itself between the cobblestones grasping onto my jacket. I could see the dim light shining on the near trees and the dragging was abruptly stopped. Instantly everything went dark, and I could feel a ragged sack around my head, the iron smell of blood emanated from the sack, invading my nostrils. I could feel the cold hand of the man pulsating as he forcefully uprooted me from the ground. He began to roughly move me into the house, each plank making a sharp creaking sound as I stood on them. Eventually, I was thrown into an old chair that looked as though it had been soaked in old blood with crooked nails that had randomly been hammered into the chair. Worn leather belt straps were firmly wrapped around my wrists and ankles, keeping me bolstered to the chair. The sack ripped from my head; I could see the room I was in. The room adorned noses, ears and fingers that were suspended by fishhooks. Blood seemed to cover the counter tops of the room and had bronzed with time. \n\nThe man hastily left the room; the door slamming shut behind him. I attempted to release myself from the leather belt shackles that gripped themselves around my wrists. After an arduous attempt at liberating myself from the chair, the prongs of the belts began to loosen, and I was able to free my wrists. I hastily began to loosen my ankles from the chair; the door swung open. The man stood at the doorway; his grin being fully extended. The sound of friction as his teeth grinded together. I attempted to flee the room, but the man darted towards me in a flash. He tackled me to the ground, his cold hands grappling around my shoulders pulling me towards him. I stretched my arm out towards to the blood-stained counter where a sharp knife lay. I was flipped over by the man who began to strangle me and with each second, I could feel myself getting more tired as each breath of air left my body. Using my hand, I blindly searched around the countertop, attempting to grab the knife. My sight began to go blurred and I remember feeling as though I was going to die in that moment. I grabbed the handle of the knife and thoughtlessly forced the knife into the man's throat. A black sludge trickled down the cut where the knife had been, and this black liquid began to pour through of the crevices of the man's teeth. The rugged grasp of the man loosened giving me the little strength I had to push him off me. A quiet hiss, like that of a snake was heard from the man as I got up. I darted towards the door and crashed out of the house, stumbling as I fell down the small steps that led off the porch.  \n\nThe trees were imposing, they towered over me every turn I took. There was a thick cover of darkness that made it troubling to see what was around me. For a long time, I felt lost in the thick void of trees that I was surrounded in. My legs ached from the arduous journey across the forest. Standing at the edge of the forest, I could see an array of lights shimmering in the distance. I plodded along the main road, where I eventually found myself in the city. The grime and sludge that was once covered all over the apartments was no longer there. Trembling along the streets, I eventually staggered into the apartment complex. The smell of moist carpet filled the air, and the buzz of the UV lights invaded my ears. Slogging my way to my apartment, I opened the door and fell onto my bed. \n\n The next morning, I awoke peacefully, yet still in my dirty clothes. I hastily got up, realising that I hadn’t even attempted to call the police. That morning I went to the station and attempted to explain to them what had happened. I told them about the sludge and the pale man but the more I detailed the events that had occurred the night prior the more that I began to realise how crazy I sounded. The response from the police was a mix of confusion and concern. In my last efforts to try and convince them that I wasn’t just some local crackhead, I explained to them how there was a log cabin in the woods which was presumably where the pale man resided. When I exclaimed this detail to them the room seemed to shift. Both policemen who were interviewing me at the time slowly looked and at one and other with disbelief. They told me that they would investigate it and have people go over to the log cabin. A week later, they told me that they found no pale man within the log cabin however there was a potent aroma of chemicals within each room of the house, especially the kitchen. Not only that but they said they found a battered and broken chair within the kitchen, the same one I had been strapped to. However, the chair was vacant of any nails or blood. As I wrapped things up with the officers, I had a feeling that they knew something that I didn’t. Ever since I had told them about the cabin, they seemed on edge and shaky. While I was leaving the building, I even saw one of the officers who had interviewed me before muttering to himself “I can’t believe this is happening.” I asked him what he meant by this. His face, covered in desperation, turned to me and said, “He’s back.” After hearing that I was extremely unnerved. I decided to get a drink and go home.  \n\nEver since that dreadful night I have attempted to remove it from my mind however it has clung to my brain like a parasite. It has been seven months since then, yet I still can’t shake the memory of that pale man lurking in the shadows. I hope I never see him again.",

        "text": "  \n\n“Morning” \n\nI said groggily to my mother as I stumbled towards the coffee pot to jolt myself awake with enough caffeine to kill a small horse. \n\nI guess if I’d had been a little more awake I would’ve instantly caught the irritated and perplexed look on her face as she sat at the dining room table with her own coffee mug in hand, but being drowsy and barely conscious as a result of staying up a little too late and waking up a little too early meant that fine perception skills were out the window until I  had at least drank two cups, but even in my half sleep state I could tell something was off by her complete lack of response.\n\nMy mother, who was normally very cheerful and cordial even to the most familiar people in her life, was only ever silent for two reasons. She was either reading something, or she was mad at someone, and as I looked over to see her staring at me from across the kitchen without a book in sight, I knew that I was dealing with a silence from the latter of the two scenarios. \n\n“What’s up mama? You okay?” \n\nFor a moment or two she just stared at me with this expression that silently screamed *“Are you freakin serious?”* but remembering her natural cordiality she shook her head slightly before responding. \n\n“Mike showed me a picture of your uhm . . . your little project out in the yard. He’s not happy about it, and neither am I.” \n\nI couldn’t help but furrow my brow at the remark. Admittedly I have been known to do a disappointing thing or two in my day, but I always at least tried to fess up to them, but as my mother spoke to me I racked my mind for a clue. At least some kind of indication as to what she was talking about, but the longer I thought the more I began to realize I genuinely had no idea what she was upset about. Being tired, and now tired and confused. I simply gave up trying to solve the mystery after only a few moments of deliberation. I decided that playing dumb was the best course of action. After all, being dumb in this case was simply being honest, and honesty is always the best policy. \n\n“I’m sorry mom, but I really don’t know what you’re talking ab-“\n\n“Don’t start that crap with me Cole, You’re telling me that disgusting, creepy thing just propped itself up overnight? Grew legs and stopped being animate right in the middle of our field?”\n\nMy furrowed brow steadily transformed itself into a completely perplexed scowl. I could feel my face getting hot and my mouth dropping open in a subtle, but again involuntary expression of not only confusion now, but confusion and irritability. \n\n“Mom I’m serious!” I reproached a little louder than intended. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I haven’t even had time to go out to the field for like, two days with work and school and everything. What is out there that you think I did?!”\n\nMoms are good at a lot of things, and my mom was a pretty kickass mom even by mom standards. Her lie detector was something to behold. Even I’ll admit that. It was an unspoken rule in our family that lying to mom was never worth the risk. She always knew, and always called it out, but as she read my expression from across the room I could see her hardened expression lighten up a bit, and then quickly become replaced with a look of . . . Well, I don’t know really. Concern? Anxiousness maybe?\n\n“Come with me.” \n\nYou guys remember that book “Scary Stories to Tell in The Dark?” with all the scary stories and the traumatizing pictures that someone thought would be perfect for grade school kids?\n\nYou remember that story about the scarecrow? Harold, I think? It stands out as a particularly spooky freaking story. At least in my memory. The picture with it of course made it all the worse, just like every picture in that book did, but as I stood in the middle of the north field next my mother on our families fifteen-acre property It dawned on me that this horrible thing might be to much for even the author of “Scary Stories To Tell in the Dark.” Harold was looking a lot more like Harry Potter in comparison to this horrible creation. \n\nPropped up on an old fence post in the middle of our field was a scarecrow. Not a scarecrow like the cute little straw hat and button eyes, and not a scarecrow like the two-dimensional drawing of some psychopath's daydreams. The whole figure mounted up on this post was just. . . Wrong. \n\nIt looked something like a woman, an older woman. Or at least someone sickos best attempt at one. A mangy, tangled looking wig of hair that was far too blonde to be a natural hair color sat on top of her head like a mop that someone had left out in a windstorm. Huge thick tangles scattered off in every direction. The head itself seemed to be some kind of typical straw dome that you’d normally see. Little bits and pieces of straw were sticking out between the tearing stitches and ears and other orifices so that’s how I was able to tell, but instead of just leaving well enough alone whoever made this scarecrow decided to sew a mask over the straw portion, some spots were stretched so tight that they looked like they’d tear at any moment, other spots had given way and hung loose in thick stretchy polymer bags. The image gave this lady scarecrow a look like something out of the walking dead, mildew and mold had started to form in spots here and there giving the pasty complexion a horrible blue and green tint. Her empty mouth hung open in this awful looking scream, a black void where teeth and a tongue might be seemed to stretch endlessly into the chasm of the straw dome just beneath it. \n\nBut even though the mouth was left empty. For some wild reason the time had been taken to sew eyes into it, but of course. Even though there was apparently time to sew the eyes, there wasn’t any time to sew the eyes correctly. Or even close. There were no eyelids, so instead you had these two eerily fake cloudy blue marbles that created this wide-eyed stare into everything and nothing at the same time. \n\nThe creator of this scarecrow didn’t just do the face and eyes either. At the end of each outstretched arm were fake hands. Again, crudely sewn in place. They waved limply in the southern Ohio winds in whatever direction it decided to blow. Thrown over the body was a filthy white night gown, and a very expensive looking pair of hiking boots covered what I was sure had to be straw packed legs and torso. The boots had the distinct “Wolverine” logo on the sides, and the bright yellow boot laces stood out drastically against the rest of the scarecrows drabby appearance. I knew there was no way that there was skin beneath the dress and socks and boots though. I mean who in the hell would take the time to put fake skin over the entirety of this scarecrow? It had to be just straw under the clothes. \n\n“Wh-What?” It was all I could stutter out as I gazed at the horrible and inexplicable creation in front of me. \n\n“You didn’t do this?” My mom asked almost making me jump. In all my bewilderment and general disturbance, I had all but completely forgotten that mom was out here with me. \n\n“No mom, I swear!” I professed my innocence as my arm extended out to the scarecrow like some sort of ‘case-in-point- ‘evidence. “Why would anyone do this?”\n\nAs the words left my mouth, and my mother's expression once again changed from disgust to something else entirely. I was finally able to pinpoint what it was exactly I was seeing on her face as the awful realization of the situation began to fall into place in my mind as well. It was like the late November air in the north fields had grown increasingly colder with every passing moment of post revelation. \n\n*I know that I know I didn’t put this out here, and there’s no way Mom or Mike or anyone that we knew for that matter would be sick enough, or even bored enough. To put something like this out in our field, and so that can only mean one thing. Some random, obviously troubled stranger had taken hours to build this crazy fucked up scarecrow and managed to place it square in the middle of our field without any of us taking notice.*\n\nThe look I had seen on my mom’s face earlier, and the one she now had. The one that I was without a doubt sure that I had too was one of concern, and growing fear. \n\n“I’ll check the trail cameras on the west tree line.” I finally managed to utter as we continued to stare at the horrible thing. “Maybe it picked up something. No promises though. If they came from the south fields, or Old Macs property then they’d be to far away for the cameras to pick up.”\n\nMom nodded her head in troubled silence before responding. \n\n“I don’t want this thing in our yard for another minute. Mikes in Phoenix until Tuesday.”\n\n“I’ll get rid of it. Mind if I just bury burn the thing? I don’t want to really walk any kind of distance with it at all.”\n\nMom nodded in agreement before we silently hopped back into the Gator vehicle we’d rode out in and made our way back to the house. \n\nSeveral hours later I found myself standing in a hole some four feet deep and three feet wide. Breathing heavily from the labor I’d put into digging it. I grabbed a drink from my water bottle but made it quick. The knowledge of standing under this creepy scarecrow alone in an empty field was by its own right enough to put me on edge but looking up at it and seeing those empty eyes, and those lifeless looking hands waving about in the wind made me want to all but run away from the place in fear. \n\nI stepped out of the hole, lit a cigarette and grabbed my woodcutting axe from the back of the Gator. After walking behind the scarecrow and giving the old fence post five or six good strikes I began to notice yet another highly disturbing detail. With every impact the heavy blade made against the fence post, dozens of black flies would come flying out of the scarecrow's tears and rips. After two or three I began to see that maggots were clearly piling up beneath the shadow of the scarecrow’s frame. Wiggling around in vain trying to find some kind of shelter from the elements they’d just been exposed to.\n\nAs the wind shifted in my direction, I furled my nose and almost heaved at the smell of the rotten straw and old mildew-soaked clothes. It had this almost sickly-sweet smell, like old fruit that someone had wrapped in raw steak and left out in the sun to rot. I had never smelled something quite so rotted away before, and I thought about how someone could’ve carried this scarecrow out here without literally passing out from the odor of it.\n\nAfter another strike or two with the axe I decided that the fence post was probably weak enough to kick apart. Lining myself up with the center of the post the scarecrow was propped on, I gave it a hard kick, and then another. A loud crack could be heard as the weakened post gave way and fell forward, putting the scarecrow face down into the hole I had just dug for it. As it hit the ground the waterlogged hay made a disgusting ‘squish’ sound as huge swarms of black flies vacated the premises of their impromptu home. Waving my hand away from the insects with a grimace on my face I made my way back to the gator and retrieved the metal cannister of kerosene that I had brought along with me. \n\nAfter dousing the scarecrow, mixing in the horrible decay smell with the pungent ‘fuel’ smell. I threw my lit cigarette into the hole from a distance to set the scarecrow alight, but surprise surprise. It didn’t take. \n\n“Of course,” I mumbled to myself as I retrieved the box of matches from my jacket pocket and struck one alight. As I tossed it into the pit the flame caught enough of the kerosene to ignite it. \n\nA loud “whoosh” sound emanated from the hole as I covered my eyes from the sudden brightness of the pit around me. The initial ignition, followed by the kindling from the fence post and the straw the scarecrow was made out of and the clothes it was wearing was enough to keep the fire going for the next hour or so. \n\nAs time passed the flames dwindled down to almost embers as they struggled to find things to devour in the pit, and eventually the embers died down as well. Leaving only a pile of blackened debris and white ash where the scarecrow used to be. As the sun began to set, I started backfilling the hole I’d dug. Once the hole was refilled, I’d put grass seed and straw down over it, and there’d be no evidence of this scarecrow ever being here at all by next spring. \n\nIt was in the middle of this backfilling process that I was suddenly caught off guard by several flashlights in my face, and loud commandeering voices telling me to drop my shovel and step away from the hole.\n\nAmidst the blinding confusion I could hear my mom shouting from behind the disorienting lights. \n\n“Cole, it’s okay! It’s going to be okay! We didn’t know, how could we? Please officer you have to believe us we would never do something like this!” \n\nAs I stood in the field with my hands up a silhouetted figure approached me and turned me around, putting my hands behind my back as he did so. Before I could even respond I felt the cold metal of handcuffs against my wrists and felt myself being assertively escorted across the field to the series of police cars at the edge of our property. To my right I could see an old red truck I’d never noticed before being pulled by a wench onto the back of a tow truck. \n\n“Have you ever seen this woman?” The middle aged, round faced and mustached police officer said to me sternly as held up a picture of an older woman. In the picture she was smiling, and her arm was reached out towards a valley from the scenic outlook the picture was taken on. She looked happy, but I had never seen the women before. Again, I played the honest fool, because honesty is the best policy. \n\n“No sir, I’ve never seen this woman before. Will you please tell me what this is about?”\n\nThe police officer shook his head and pointed towards the red pickup on the back of the tow vehicle that was slowly idling its way off the property. \n\n“Her names Clara Whitesides. She’s been missing for two weeks. That’s her truck on y’alls property. Looks a little suspicious doesn’t it son?”\n\nI shook my head and tried to find some kind of way to profess my innocence against the seemingly inevitable trouble I was finding myself in. \n\n“Sir I promise I have never seen this woman in my life. I haven’t even really been home much in the last two days and i-“\n\nAs I looked again at the photograph my heart sank as a horrible dawning crept its way into my very being. \n\nClara Whitesides horrifyingly enough did look quite familiar. She had light blue eyes, and a head of blonde hair that must’ve been died. It was far too blonde to be any kind of natural hair color.\n\nAnd she was wearing a very expensive pair of hiking boots. From her angle in the picture the “Wolverine” logo could be seen very clearly, and her bright yellow boot laces seemed to stand out in contrast. \n\nMy stomach churned with horror as I thought back to the scarecrow. That messed up sewing job. The smell of rotting hay. The black flies and the maggots poured out of it as I chopped the post down and kicked it into the hole. \n\nSomeone didn’t just place an ugly looking scarecrow on our property. That would’ve been awful enough. \n\nNo, whoever had kidnapped this woman had killed her, skinned her and taxidermized everything they could onto a straw base, and left it out on our field for us to find . . .\n\nI had just burned and buried a woman’s corpse. \n\n“Son, are you alright?” The cop asked again as he undoubtedly saw my complexion change from sun tanned to pale white as I looked over to the backfilled hole that police dogs were digging at furiously. Their owners shining flashlights onto the loosened dirt mound to see whatever came up.\n\n“Son? What are they going to find in that hole? If you know something, you tell me right now.”\n\nI shook my head slowly and almost automatically as I desperately searched every frenzied corner of my mind to explain to this police officer how I’d just inadvertently spent the better part of a day helping some psychopath dispose of a body . . .\n\nI got sent to the police station, and interrogated for a long time, but ultimately, like I’ve said a few times now. Honesty is the best policy, and though what I had done was clearly disturbing, and technically law breaking. My ignorance to the situation was enough to at least eventually let me go home, but I will never be able to look at another scarecrow the same.",

        "author": "Kolif_Avander",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11qmujz/the_cobblestone_path/",
        "text": " \n\n*This passage is from the journal of a women named Jessica Norton.* \n\nIn my city, the roads stretched themselves throughout the landscape. They went so far that they even passed the mountains that hid our city from the rest. It was said that along this road there was a dirt path that led into the large forest that spread itself along the northern area of the district. The forest had a silver lake that would, at night, dazzle and shimmer, reflecting the moons beauty. Not only that but it was also said that a person lived in these woods inside a log cabin that could only be located by following an archaic cobblestone path that led to the house. The myth was that anyone who made it to the house would never return and those that lived would get lost trying to find it and eventually make their way back to the city. In the myth it was even said that, on a rare occasion, a person would come into the city and murder those who had attempted to find the cabin. Whether this myth was no more than a fake tale told to scare people around a campfire or whether the legends and myths of old were tangible, what I experienced that night was so vivid and abhorrent that it will stay with me until the day I die. \n\nI was twenty-one at the time and I was partaking a multitude of part-time jobs to keep up with my rent. All the jobs I took on were at night as I was in college during the day. Not only that but the night had grown darker in the recent weeks so I could only rely on the streetlamps to navigate my way home. It was around one o’clock in the morning and I was finishing up my shift at a grocery store that I had been working at for a couple of months. My friend, Sarah had come into the store. She did the one to six shifts for the early hours of the morning. Why someone would be getting groceries at one o’clock let alone four or five o’clock I don’t know but I didn’t care either. Sarah unbuttoned her coat and unveiled her scarf that was hiding half of her face. She came over to me and exchanged words for a moment, during which I couldn’t help but feel as though she was on edge about something. While we were talking, I commented on it to see if my intuition was correct. “Well, the thing is maybe I am being paranoid or something, but the thing is I am sure that I saw something lurking outside.” In response to this, I rolled my eyes and said, “It was probably just an animal.” and patted Sarah on the shoulder while chuckling. “Oh, whatever!” Sarah said and I walked out, playfully shaking my head. \n\nThe street was so gloomy that the lamps could barely fight the thick cloak of darkness that choked all crevices of the city. The wind was harsh, lashing at my body from all angles. I hastily put on my coat and made sure that the hood was tight around my head so that I wouldn’t expose myself to the wind's fury. I trekked along the pavement, being faithful to the lamps in the hopes that they would guide me to the bus-stop. It had rained earlier that day and due to this the pavements and roads were slippery. I fell victim to the weather as I slipped on a pool of water, yet I was able to regain my balance by grabbing onto a lamp for support. Due to the shock, it took a while to regain my composure, but I eventually came to my senses. I looked around my environment and behind me in the far distance I could ever so slightly make out a figure that seemed to be hiding in the dark. I tried to focus in on this figure however I soon lost focus of it, and it was lost to the shadows. Shortly after that I felt a distinctive chill that crawled its way up to my spine and made its way to my skull. I could feel a cold sweat beginning to pour down my forehead and my body began to freeze. I slowly gathered myself and continued to walk down the street. \n\nI found myself at a curb and I could see the bright flashing car lights fly past me. I hesitated for a while in fear that, due to the darkness, the cars wouldn’t see me, and I would end up being a red smear all over the road. I eventually got the courage and darted towards the other end of the street. Luckily, I got across unscathed and in one piece. To the left of me, where I would normally go to get the bus, the road was cut off by police. This meant I would have to go a different way to get to the bus-stop, I would have to go into the dark depths of the inner-city. The inner-city was littered with thin alleyways that were encapsulated in darkness. The walls were drenched with a viscous sludge that seemed to be decorated in all areas of the city. There were no lamps that provided some sort of visibility, there was only the moonlight that reflected the large pools of water that had been left by the rain. Luckily, I was prepared and had a flashlight with me. The flashlight, however, did not go far and was quite dim. I navigated around the inner-city, trying to use my memory to figure out where I needed to go. \n\nI made my way to a large courtyard. The courtyard was once a luscious plane of grass that local residents would sit at during the afternoon. However, the courtyard seemed to be barren of any form of greenery and was instead covered in the same viscous sludge that had clung to the walls of the buildings a few moments before. I stood froze at the edge of courtyard, considering whether or not to go across it, when I heard a loud metallic beat of footsteps approaching from behind me. I turned to see a dark figure a close distance away from me. The figure seemed to be approaching swiftly and without a second thought I attempted to dart across the courtyard. However, as I got to a third of the way across, the sludge had wrapped itself around my shoes and I could feel it slowly dragging me in with it. I jumped forward however I fell into the sludge and could feel its darkness attempting to consume me. The orchestra of metallic footsteps grew louder and louder. For what felt like an eternity of wriggling in sludge I eventually tore myself out of its grasp and stumbled out of the courtyard. I turned back and could see the figure now at the beginning of the courtyard, it began to make its way across however seemed to not struggle against the sludge. I ran with my clothes now tattered from the struggle and headed into one of the thin alleyways in the street. I hid in amongst the rubbish of a garbage can, with my eyes peeking out of its crevice. I could see the moonlight reflecting the figure as it approached towards the alleyway. Its face was a ghostly white that adorned an uncanny grin that exposed all of its rotting teeth. Any other grim details this being may have possessed were hidden by the rim of its large top hat. I heard the footsteps growing even more aggressive as it approached, the hard metal thuds crashing against the fractured pavement below. It came very close to me, so close that I could hear the heavy, demonic breathing of the creature. However, it seemed to not have noticed me hiding and it left taking its orchestra of metal thuds with it. After I could no longer hear its daunting sounds, I stepped out of the garbage bin and carried on towards the bus stop. \n\nI eventually came out of the inner city and was back on the main road. In the distance I could see the bus stop. I darted towards the bus stop, using every ounce of my energy to get there. I had gotten halfway across the street when I started to feel extremely cold and almost instantly I was frozen in place. I could see that the streetlights began to flicker and then popped. After only a few seconds the street was completely pitch black and I started to feel numb.  \n\nAfter, what only felt like a few seconds, I awoke to see large pine trees towering over me. I looked down and I saw a cobblestone path below me that I was being dragged along. I was bound by a thick piece of rope that went from my shoulders to my ankles. I attempted to turn my head to see what I was being dragged by and I could see a tall man wearing a dark black coat who was holding the rope that was wrapped around me. Although my vision was blurred, I could make out a log cabin in the distance that was dimly lit by small lanterns that were decorated randomly across the cabin. \n\nI did not even attempt to struggle as I knew that any efforts would have been futile. I could feel the grime and dirt that had collected itself between the cobblestones grasping onto my jacket. I could see the dim light shining on the near trees and the dragging was abruptly stopped. Instantly everything went dark, and I could feel a ragged sack around my head, the iron smell of blood emanated from the sack, invading my nostrils. I could feel the cold hand of the man pulsating as he forcefully uprooted me from the ground. He began to roughly move me into the house, each plank making a sharp creaking sound as I stood on them. Eventually, I was thrown into an old chair that looked as though it had been soaked in old blood with crooked nails that had randomly been hammered into the chair. Worn leather belt straps were firmly wrapped around my wrists and ankles, keeping me bolstered to the chair. The sack ripped from my head; I could see the room I was in. The room adorned noses, ears and fingers that were suspended by fishhooks. Blood seemed to cover the counter tops of the room and had bronzed with time. \n\nThe man hastily left the room; the door slamming shut behind him. I attempted to release myself from the leather belt shackles that gripped themselves around my wrists. After an arduous attempt at liberating myself from the chair, the prongs of the belts began to loosen, and I was able to free my wrists. I hastily began to loosen my ankles from the chair; the door swung open. The man stood at the doorway; his grin being fully extended. The sound of friction as his teeth grinded together. I attempted to flee the room, but the man darted towards me in a flash. He tackled me to the ground, his cold hands grappling around my shoulders pulling me towards him. I stretched my arm out towards to the blood-stained counter where a sharp knife lay. I was flipped over by the man who began to strangle me and with each second, I could feel myself getting more tired as each breath of air left my body. Using my hand, I blindly searched around the countertop, attempting to grab the knife. My sight began to go blurred and I remember feeling as though I was going to die in that moment. I grabbed the handle of the knife and thoughtlessly forced the knife into the man's throat. A black sludge trickled down the cut where the knife had been, and this black liquid began to pour through of the crevices of the man's teeth. The rugged grasp of the man loosened giving me the little strength I had to push him off me. A quiet hiss, like that of a snake was heard from the man as I got up. I darted towards the door and crashed out of the house, stumbling as I fell down the small steps that led off the porch.  \n\nThe trees were imposing, they towered over me every turn I took. There was a thick cover of darkness that made it troubling to see what was around me. For a long time, I felt lost in the thick void of trees that I was surrounded in. My legs ached from the arduous journey across the forest. Standing at the edge of the forest, I could see an array of lights shimmering in the distance. I plodded along the main road, where I eventually found myself in the city. The grime and sludge that was once covered all over the apartments was no longer there. Trembling along the streets, I eventually staggered into the apartment complex. The smell of moist carpet filled the air, and the buzz of the UV lights invaded my ears. Slogging my way to my apartment, I opened the door and fell onto my bed. The next morning, I awoke peacefully, yet still in my dirty clothes. I hastily got up, realising that I hadn’t even attempted to call the police. That morning I went to the station and attempted to explain to them what had happened. I told them about the sludge and the pale man but the more I detailed the events that had occurred the night prior the more that I began to realise how crazy I sounded. The response from the police was a mix of confusion and concern. In my last efforts to try and convince them that I wasn’t just some local crackhead, I explained to them how there was a log cabin in the woods which was presumably where the pale man resided. When I exclaimed this detail to them the room seemed to shift. Both policemen who were interviewing me at the time slowly looked and at one and other with disbelief. They told me that they would investigate it and have people go over to the log cabin. A week later, they told me that they found no pale man within the log cabin however there was a potent aroma of chemicals within each room of the house, especially the kitchen. Not only that but they said they found a battered and broken chair within the kitchen, the same one I had been strapped to. However, the chair was vacant of any nails or blood. As I wrapped things up with the officers, I had a feeling that they knew something that I didn’t. Ever since I had told them about the cabin, they seemed on edge and shaky. While I was leaving the building, I even saw one of the officers who had interviewed me before muttering to himself “I can’t believe this is happening.” I asked him what he meant by this. His face, covered in desperation, turned to me and said, “He’s back.” After hearing that I was extremely unnerved. I decided to get a drink and go home.  \n\nEver since that dreadful night I have attempted to remove it from my mind however it has clung to my brain like a parasite. It has been seven months since then, yet I still can’t shake the memory of that pale man lurking in the shadows. I hope I never see him again.",

        "text": "\n\nI was 13 when it happened. I was in girl scouts, and the meetings always took place at my old elementary school(for grades 1st-4th). I always found it nostalgic, yet somewhat creepy. My dad often brought me early. I'd let myself in and stay in there for often up to 40 minutes until someone showed up. My dad refused to bring me at the time I told him too. He thought I was being rude. But, this one small problem would become something bigger.\n\n It was just after daylight savings time had happened. My dad kept telling me it was a week later, but he was wrong. Both my mom and I knew this. He brought me to girl scouts 2 hours early. Said I was only 10 minutes early according to his clock. He was very wrong. I knew that. But, I went in anyways. I found being early interesting. I remember that there was a storm coming. I thought my leaders were crazy for letting GS happen that night. The storm had already started, but it was light. Within 30 minutes though, it had gotten worse. Very worse. I couldn't see outside due to the fast snow flakes. I got a notification from the app that my troop leaders said important info from. GS had been canceled. \n\nI decided to call my dad, but there was no service. Wifi was very bad there. I decided to leave the school in hopes for better wifi, but to my shock the door was stuck. I cursed under my breath. I was stuck in a school I hadn't really ventured through (besides the art room 2 halls away) for 5 years. I barely remembered where the gym was, let alone any of the important spots (bathroom, my old classroom that always had a box of food in it). I had no idea how long I'd be here for. \n\nI decided to go back to the art room. All of my things (except my phone that was with me) was in that room. But, to my dismay, while I was on my way there the lights cut. \"NO!\" I shouted out loud. I was in the dark with nothing more then the slight light of my phone. I scrambled to turn on the flashlight on my phone. But, for some reason, it didn't work. My phone was rather old, and I needed a new one. \"Turn on you-\" suddenly I stopped talking. I had heard a click. Like a camera. That's when I got an idea. I could turn on my flash and use that as a flashlight! I would delete the photos later.\n\n I used that to make my way to the art room. Once I got there, I checked my camera roll. My heart dropped. There was a dark figure standing at the end of the hallway in the first photo. I quickly flipped through the photos as the creature got closer, but not close enough to tell what it was. Right before I got to the last one I got a call. \n\nThe name was \"&gt;#*÷^(÷&amp;÷(@&lt;÷÷&amp;[÷&amp;÷÷*#^÷*#&amp;#*#*#;#*#&amp;#&amp;92&lt;3[3_3\" . The number was familiar as well.  I can't tell you, because it was my friends' number. I thought maybe she was there too. Pranking me. She was in GS too, after all. I picked it up. But, all there was only breathing. It was like an old man and an old woman was both breathing at the same time in the same way. But, that wasn't the creepiest part. \n\nIn the background, I heard my OWN heavy breathing. I mumbled \"what the F\" to myself and low and behold, in the background I heard myself mumble \"what the F\". Then, the lights came back. The line went dead. That's when I remembered. There wasn't wifi. How did I get a call? I slowly looked up. I almost screamed at what I saw. The art room's phone was dangling over the desk. I was alone though. I then remembered that there was another door. It was in the gym. An emergency exit. Always locked from the outside, but unlocked on the inside. It led into a field.\n\n I gripped onto my phone tightly(so I wouldn't drop it) and quickly got up. Forget my coat, earbuds, and sash. I needed to get the hell out of dodge before the lights cut again. I ran into the hallway. I had no idea where the gym was, but I remembered the doors were big and orange. I got around 2 hallways before the lights started flashing. There was snow on the power cord that was weighing down so hard that it was making the lights flicker. I felt the thing running after me every time the lights flickered off. I didn't care though, as the big orange doors were right ahead. The doors were very heavy. Either that, or I was very weak. But, I managed to open them AND actually get a look at what I was running from. I almost passed out from shock. \n\nThere was a very thin and tall creature running at me on all fours. It was unhumanly fast. It didn't have hands or feet. Just nubs. It was slipping as it ran from not having feet or hands. It was white. It had no eyes, but a carved smile. Made from a carving knife. It's loud breathing mimicked that of the breathing I had heard in the phone call. IT HAD BEEN IN THE SAME ROOM AS ME IN THE DARK. \n\nI ran into the gym as quickly as I could. I almost immediately noticed the emergency door.  I ran as quickly as I could through the gigantic gym and got out. The thing followed me outside. I ran towards the fence. It was dark out, so the thing was completely there. I jumped the fence. It was specifically for small children to not be able to cross without the help of an adult so I easily jumped it. The thing on the other hand did not easily cross. The nubs did not help it. There was a police station across the road. I went in and reported it. I was laughed at in the face and told to go home instead of wasting both of our time. I was never believed and even got in trouble for getting the police involved. I don't know what happened to it afterward.I was 13 when it happened. I was in girl scouts, and the meetings always took place at my old elementary school(for grades 1st-4th). I always found it nostalgic, yet somewhat creepy. My dad often brought me early. I'd let myself in and stay in there for often up to 40 minutes until someone showed up. My dad refused to bring me at the time I told him too. He thought I was being rude. But, this one small problem would become something bigger.\n\n It was just after daylight savings time had happened. My dad kept telling me it was a week later, but he was wrong. Both my mom and I knew this. He brought me to girl scouts 2 hours early. Said I was only 10 minutes early according to his clock. He was very wrong. I knew that. But, I went in anyways. I found being early interesting. I remember that there was a storm coming. I thought my leaders were crazy for letting GS happen that night. The storm had already started, but it was light. Within 30 minutes though, it had gotten worse. Very worse. I couldn't see outside due to the fast snow flakes. I got a notification from the app that my troop leaders said important info from. GS had been canceled. \n\nI decided to call my dad, but there was no service. Wifi was very bad there. I decided to leave the school in hopes for better wifi, but to my shock the door was stuck. I cursed under my breath. I was stuck in a school I hadn't really ventured through (besides the art room 2 halls away) for 5 years. I barely remembered where the gym was, let alone any of the important spots (bathroom, my old classroom that always had a box of food in it). I had no idea how long I'd be here for. \n\nI decided to go back to the art room. All of my things (except my phone that was with me) was in that room. But, to my dismay, while I was on my way there the lights cut. \"NO!\" I shouted out loud. I was in the dark with nothing more then the slight light of my phone. I scrambled to turn on the flashlight on my phone. But, for some reason, it didn't work. My phone was rather old, and I needed a new one. \"Turn on you-\" suddenly I stopped talking. I had heard a click. Like a camera. That's when I got an idea. I could turn on my flash and use that as a flashlight! I would delete the photos later.\n\n I used that to make my way to the art room. Once I got there, I checked my camera roll. My heart dropped. There was a dark figure standing at the end of the hallway in the first photo. I quickly flipped through the photos as the creature got closer, but not close enough to tell what it was. Right before I got to the last one I got a call. \n\nThe name was \"&gt;#*÷^(÷&amp;÷(@&lt;÷÷&amp;[÷&amp;÷÷*#^÷*#&amp;#*#*#;#*#&amp;#&amp;92&lt;3[3_3\" . The number was familiar as well.  I can't tell you, because it was my friends' number. I thought maybe she was there too. Pranking me. She was in GS too, after all. I picked it up. But, all there was only breathing. It was like an old man and an old woman was both breathing at the same time in the same way. But, that wasn't the creepiest part. \n\nIn the background, I heard my OWN heavy breathing. I mumbled \"what the F\" to myself and low and behold, in the background I heard myself mumble \"what the F\". Then, the lights came back. The line went dead. That's when I remembered. There wasn't wifi. How did I get a call? I slowly looked up. I almost screamed at what I saw. The art room's phone was dangling over the desk. I was alone though. I then remembered that there was another door. It was in the gym. An emergency exit. Always locked from the outside, but unlocked on the inside. It led into a field.\n\n I gripped onto my phone tightly(so I wouldn't drop it) and quickly got up. Forget my coat, earbuds, and sash. I needed to get the hell out of dodge before the lights cut again. I ran into the hallway. I had no idea where the gym was, but I remembered the doors were big and orange. I got around 2 hallways before the lights started flashing. There was snow on the power cord that was weighing down so hard that it was making the lights flicker.

        "text": "[I don’t know](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11f515o/tales_from_a_town_that_doesnt_exist_anymore_part_1/)how long it was before any of us felt comfortable moving, but Clay was the first, shooting to his feet and hissing a string of expletives. His arms ran with scarlet ribbons of blood, trailing between his fingers as he picked out the glass that had caught him. \n\nHe’d been nearest to the door which had burst with the first few windows, and caught the worst of it, though all of our heads rang and stomachs turned with nausea.\n\n“What - what was that?” Phil managed. His eyes were wide, with a look I’d seen on pictures of war veterans or victims of some disaster, a glassy far-away stare. \n\n“There was something…in the sky. What was it?”\n\nHis voice shook as though he was close to tears. \n\n“I don’t know,” I answered, surprised by the sound of my own voice. \n\n“We - we should call the fucking cops or something, the - the National Guard, the goddamn Air Force!” Clay cried, his voice cracking as fear and panic still overwhelmed him.\n\nI nodded, head still throbbing and mind racing as I went for my cell phone. A feeling like cold water being dumped overhead made the blood freeze in my veins.\n\n*No signal.*\n\nI shook my head. \n\n“There’s no service.”\n\nClay’s face contorted into a look that was a mix of surprise, denial, and terror, as he pulled his phone from his pocket. Phillip did the same, hand shaking all the while.\n\nNo one said anything, the two of them staring at their phones with variations of the same expression. They didn’t need to say a word. I knew what it meant.\n\n“Let’s just go.” I said.\n\nI struggled to my feet, the world seeming to spin beneath me for a moment as I gripped a chair for balance. I helped Phil to his feet, his eyes never once leaving the skies beyond the broken windows. \n\nClay led the way, grimacing as his arms continued to run with blood. As we made our way outside, I could tell immediately that something was deeply wrong. That smell hung thick in the air still, but it was more than that, the streets were emptier than before…\n\n“They’re *gone*. *Everything* is fucking *gone*…”\n\nClay spoke the thought aloud, just as a cold, awful realization dawned on me. \n\nThe cars were gone now. Both the empty vehicles that had previously lined much of the streets, and Clay’s own truck, all gone. All of the vehicles but one, my own sedan, left idling in the middle of the street.\n\nWith all that happened my memory was spotty, but I felt certain that was *not* where I had left it.\n\nClay shook his head, moving aimlessly about the street head on a swivel, searching for his vehicle to no avail. Finally, he let out a scream, long and full of rage that echoed through the empty streets.\n\nPhil just kept shaking his head, muttering something to himself. I hardly had time to react as Clay made his approach, throwing up my hands to partially block the punch he threw. I felt a shock in my jaw, and for a moment I felt heat in my face, for a split second the world disappearing behind darkness and flecks of light. \n\nThe commotion seemed to kick Phillip from his stupor, and he grabbed Clay, pulling him away from me. \n\n“This was your fucking idea!” He cried, accusation heavy in his tone.\n\nI ran my hand along my jaw. My lower lip was bleeding slightly, but I was otherwise okay with the exception of the perpetual sting in my face.\n\nI know I ought to have left it alone, but I was scared and angry, days and months of dammed emotions coming to surface.\n\n“You didn’t have to come! I didn’t make you listen, what the fuck is wrong with you?” I cried, taking a step closer.\n\nClay laughed, but it was a sound without any genuine humor, mocking and belittling.\n\n“You’re a snide, self-assured asshole man. Always have been,” he said, his words coated in a palpable venom, but even worse, a sort of confident assuredness that spoke of a conviction behind them, as though he’d thought these things for quite a while.\n\n“It’s the reason we’re the only two people still willing to put up with you, it’s the reason for where you are in life with that dead end job, and it’s the reason Tracy left. You can’t ever consider someone else is right, you chide and chide, and make stupid comments until they finally give into you!”\n\nI wanted to feel something, anger, hate, an urge to hit him back even, but I couldn’t. A part of me could only sit in the recognition that, in some ways, he was right.\n\n“Stop Clay, this isn’t the time!” Phil said, putting himself between the two of us.\n\n“We need to go,” he turned to me, “We’re going to have to use your car, are you okay to drive.”\n\nI nodded, though my thoughts were still on Clay’s own words. \n\n“Then let’s go.” \n\nClay’s eyes lingered on me for a moment, and I thought I could see his expression softening before he turned and made for the car. I followed, and until we reached the car, the faint winds moving through the buildings was the only noise to accompany us.\n\nMy mind raced, Clays words, the call from earlier, and whatever had happened in the diner all spinning through my head in a vortex of thought. None of it made sense. \n\nThis place, that thing in the sky, the cars, it was impossible. I knew that as we left it behind, it would always bother me, like a picture left askew, this blindspot in what I knew to be possible.\n\n“Hello? Hello? Is anyone there?” \n\nA voice echoed through the empty streets, a woman’s by the sound of it, carried from somewhere that seemed both near and distantly behind us. It froze all three of us in place, the same question passed silently between us as though no one wanted to be the first to ask whether anyone else had heard it.\n\n“Hello?” That voice again, except this time I felt certain it was somewhere ahead. \n\nPhil snapped to face it, the fear that had seemingly dissipated slowly returning to the surface, his eyes darting about nervously. \n\nClay looked at me hard, shaking his head slowly as though he could hear my thoughts. I narrowed my eyes, holding back none of the bitterness I felt.\n\n“So some woman is alone wandering this place with…whatever the hell that thing is and you wanna leave her?”\n\nLooking back, I can’t account for the sudden defiance I felt. Perhaps my ego had finally caught up with the earlier wounds, or perhaps the idea of leaving someone here felt too much like the failure of my relationship. I can’t be certain, likely I’d need the help of a therapist over days of work to understand, and days I do not have.\n\nClay looked as though he wanted to spit in my face, shaking his head, eyes filled with something cold and unrecognizing.\n\n“You’re a fool.” he said. “And you’ll get one of us killed for it.”\n\n“He - he’s right,” Phil stammered, though he looked as though he dreaded the words.\n\n“It - it wouldn’t be right to leave her..”\n\nClay scoffed, looking between the two of us and shaking his head.\n\n“Whatever.” he relented, climbing into the backseat and letting the door slam shut behind him.\n\nPhil scanned the ground for a moment, sighing for a long moment, before looking back at me.\n\n“He’s pissed, understandably…but I’m sure he gets it. Let just see if we can find…whoever that was,” he nodded for me to follow as he made his way towards the car, pausing for a moment.\n\nHe met my eyes.\n\n“Just - promise you won’t get out of the car. We’ll drive around and look, and if we can’t find anyone, we go.”\n\nI nodded.\n\n“Yeah, okay. Promise.” \n\nWith that he made his way into the car. I followed, feeling suddenly very claustrophobic in the vehicle as we began to make our way through the streets.\n\n“Just listen for her,” I said, rolling down all four of the windows as we began moving through the streets at random, listening for any sign of the person we’d heard earlier.\n\nAt some point, I began calling out, much to Clay’s dismay, shouting for anyone to respond.\n\nIt wasn’t long before eventually, someone did.\n\n“Please! Help me! It’s coming!” \n\nThat voice again, much more clear this time, coming from a few streets away within one of the residential areas. I veered left, onto the road from where I could hear it coming. My foot settled on the gas, an unusual determination swelling in me as the calls grew louder, until we’d arrived outside a house.\n\nIt was no different than the others, a single story, red brick home, with all the windows drawn but one, and yet the sight of it sent chills down my spine. The front door sat wide open, yet I could see nothing inside.\n\nClay was already shaking his head when I turned to face them. \n\n“Fuck no. No. Look at that place it's…not right…” he trailed off, unable to put the feeling to words. \n\nI knew what he meant, I felt it too. We all could, staring back at the entrance like the maw of some animal.\n\nAnd yet as that voice echoed from within, I felt stirred by an uncharacteristic sort of boldness. \n\n“It’s fine,” I said. \n\n“I’m not gonna push it. Just…wait here. I’ll be back.”\n\nClay scoffed, and Phil just looked on with sad eyes, nodding almost to himself. \n\n“Then I’m coming.”\n\nClay looked ready to explode, staring at Phillip as though he’d grown another head. \n\n“You always go along with his bullshit.” He said, eyes narrowed as he looked at Phillip.\n\n“Whatever. I’m staying here, you two have fun. If you’re not back in ten minutes, I’m leaving without you both.”\n\nI wanted to argue, but knew it would accomplish nothing, so instead, I gave a brief nod and exited the car.\n\nPhil hurried from the backseat, following behind and I could hear the sound of the doors automatic lock as we made some distance. The nearer we came to that front door, the more I could see the house inside, with a standard foyer and living room, nothing unusual but for the utter state of disarray it was left in. Shelves were toppled, and furniture overturned, various things scattered about the floor as though a tornado had somehow moved through the place.\n\nSomehow, the opening felt…eerie, as though what lie on the other side was more than a mere house, but some other world in which something awful had happened. A part of me wondered if Clay wasn’t right, and considered turning back on the spot, but the idea filled my mouth with an awful taste at the satisfaction I knew it would bring him.\n\nSo, spurred forth by my own ego, I stepped inside. The smell was immediate, like sitting too close to an old television set just an acrid static that singed at your nose hairs, as was the feeling of a sort of chill that gripped me and made my stomach turn with nausea, my vision buzzing momentarily. \n\n“Looks worse than the diner when we left,” Phil commented, looking over one of the few coffee tables still on its feet. \n\nI nodded, the implications of the thought making me feel uneasy.\n\nBroken glass crunched beneath my feet as I stepped forward, peering into the kitchen. On the wall hung a photo, a man and a woman, and three children. I felt something shift in me, as I wondered where all of the individuals were now, and if anyone would ever know. I wondered who it was we had heard.\n\nThere was another question that was clawing at the back of my mind, one I didn’t want to acknowledge yet couldn’t ignore. Would we join them if I couldn’t find her soon?\n\n“HELP ME!” The cry echoed from somewhere deeper in the house, sudden and shrill, making me jump as I spun to face it. \n\nPhil’s reaction was the same, our eyes meeting as we searched for the source, settling on a door in the hallway ahead.\n\nEven at a distance, I could see the tremors that took him, and didn’t feel far off myself, but I was there for a reason. \n\n“You don’t have to follow me.” I said in earnest, as I began to make my way forth. Somehow, by the echo from behind the door, I knew there was a basement on the other side. I didn’t have to look to know Phillip was behind me, breathing nervously and muttering barely silent prayers.\n\nI opened the door, and we began to descend into the darkness below, hands feeling along the wall for a light switch. \n\nI felt something brush past my cheek, a string hanging overhead, and upon pulling it a dim bulb sputtered to life, offering what little light it could manage. \n\nIt did little to illuminate what lie in the basement beyond, only really serving to cast eerie shadows along the stairwell, but at least we could see where our feet were to land.\n\n“Help me….help…” that voice again but…not nearly as loud as before or as urgent.\n\nI felt one of those unearthly chills, as though my body were warning of something I couldn’t yet perceive, and it frightened me.\n\n“Do you see her?” Phillip whispered, voice still shaking as he stepped behind me, kneeling slightly as if worried standing at his full height might attract somethings attention, it took me a moment to realize I was doing the same.\n\n“No. I can’t see a damn thing,” I breathed back, gritting my teeth at the squeal of the staircase beneath my feet. \n\nFeeling its weight in my pocket, I remembered my phone. It had been all but useless sense we’d been attacked by…whatever that thing was, but the function of a flashlight was the one thing I knew it could still serve.\n\nI shined the light onto the ground below, a gray cement slab that seemed to extend through the entire room.\n\n“help…please…please help…”\n\nThat voice again, this time so small it was barely more than a whisper from…somewhere around the corner. We turned into the basement, the light exposing a small hallway ahead, leading to a boiler room. \n\nIn the hall sat a door, closed though I could see a light glowing beneath it, and hear the woman's voice from within.\n\nI glanced back at Phil, his eyes never wavering from the door, and he simply nodded. We pushed forth.\n\n“*help…please…*” \n\nThe nearer I grew to the door, the more my skin began to crawl, something off about the voice in a way I could only now process. There was an odd…hiss to it, a mechanical crackle that I couldn’t place. \n\nHands shaking I pushed the door open. The room was dark, only the glow of an old television set to prevent total blindness. \n\n“Do you smell that?” Phillip asked. \n\nI nodded, that same ozone scent hanging heavy in the air.\n\nIt took a moment to process what I was hearing, but as it began to click, confusion and dread filled me in equal measure.\n\n“*Help me…help…*” The voice echoed from the television.\n\n“That…that doesn’t make any sense,” Phillip said, voice no longer a whisper as a familiar dread filled his words.\n\n“We - we heard it from blocks away that…that’s impossible,”\n\nThe light on the screen seemed to shine with such sudden force it temporarily blinded us, bathing the room in an eerie white light, the old box set glowing like a supernova. The air seemed poised to set alight, the electric stench so strong I could feel my lungs burning.\n\n*CRASH*\n\nThe house shook, threatening to collapse in on us as that awful sound rocked the earth. The screen of the old television burst in a shower of sparks and glass, scattering across the room. \n\nPhil’s eyes met mine, a primal sort of terror filling them as his hands clasped over his ears. Something like a shriek, ancient and animal, but put through a computer filter or something of the sort pierced the air seeming to come from everywhere at once. All I could do in those moments was cover my ears and pray, until the awful cacophony ceased and the air took on that eerie stillness. \n\nIt took a moment before either of us moved, myself first, scrambling for the phone I’d dropped in the commotion before hurrying to help Phillip to his feet.\n\n“What - what was it? What the hell was that?” he asked, shock still working its way through him. \n\n“C’mon,” I urged, pulling him towards the way we’d come, and answer already in mind.\n\n“We have to go check on Clay *now*!”\n\nThat seemed to stir him, and the two of us raced out of the house, in worse condition than it had been before, and out into the front yard. \n\nThe weather had seemingly shifted in the minutes we’d spent inside, the clouds dark and foreboding, wind whipping leaves from trees and lashing its tendrils across my face.  \n\nThe car was gone. The space it had occupied almost mockingly empty, that fucking stench filling the air. There was no sign of Clay, and something told me, there wouldn’t be any longer.\n\n“It got him…” I hardly realized I was speaking the words as I did, my mind putting two and two together.\n\n“That thing…*tricked* us, and it got him.”\n\nThe swell of emotion I felt threatened to send me into freefall. He was here because of me, we were on this trip for me, and it was my choice that had gotten him into this and now…\n\nGod, and now *what*? I couldn’t even be sure of what I was guilty, couldn’t even be certain whether I’d gotten my friend killed or simply whisked off for some unknown fate.\n\n“He was right…” Phillip breathed, tears streaming openly as he stared at the spot the car had once occupied, as if at any second it might return. \n\nThe wind picked up, sending ominous whispers through the trees and tracing an icy chill down my back.\n\n“We should’ve left…we - we should’ve gone when we had the chance. It’s gonna get us now…” his tone was almost child-like, past the point of fear almost as though he were stating the dreaded reality.\n\nI shook my head, stepping in front of him and gripping him by the shoulders.\n\n“Phil, we have to go, *now*. We can - we can walk,” I spoke, though in hindsight I think even I wasn’t convinced by my words.\n\n“This place isn’t that big, it would take maybe half an hour, forty minutes, we could just stick to the main road and walk out of here.”\n\nPhil laughed, a sound devoid of humor or mocking or any sort of emotion, cold and harsh.\n\n“It’s not going to let us go. It gave us that chance, and we didn’t take it. Don’t you see?”\n\nThe skies above seemed to groan and rumble as warning of an approaching storm and yet, no signs of lightning were to be seen. The wind grew stronger, whipping my jacket about with such force it almost moved me.\n\nPhillip just shook his head, staring up at the sky. \n\n“Too late…”\n\n*CRASH*\n\nThe air itself seemed to shake as a sound like the sky tearing open above us threatened to deafen me.\n\nThe sky above was an ominous gray, every cloud swelling with the threat of a torrential rain, and at first I could see nothing but the sunlight filtered gray through the mist. \n\nAnd then, there was movement. \n\nBrief, at first, a flash of something dark enough that the sun couldn’t pierce it as it passed between an area where the cloud cover was just a bit lighter. \n\nEverything shook, my very bones seeming to move out of place as the sky seemed to split in half. From the clouds above, I could see something emerge. \n\nIn that moment, it cast a circular shadow almost thirty feet ahead, passing over the street like some new celestial body.\n\nIf you’ve never seen something impossible, witnessed something your mind knows inherently to be wrong no matter how hard it seems to grapple for some sort of understanding, you can never understand what I felt in that moment. \n\nI found myself grasping for answers, a nauseating sense of horror wracking my body.\n\n“It’s - it’s a fucking weather balloon or - or…” I could find no words, every explanation falling flat in the face of the impossible.\n\nIts shape was circular, a perfect sphere with nothing resembling a wings, or flaps, or rudders. It was a pale white, so much so that it almost reflected the light like another sun in the sky. The air hung thick with the smell and taste of ozone, so much so I couldn’t help but cough violently. \n\nIt was gone again, disappearing into the clouds, moving with such sudden speed I knew it depended on more than the wind. For several moments we saw no sight of it above, and yet the sound of its movement grew until the ground seemed to shake. \n\n“It’s coming closer,” I spoke the realization, voice hoarse as I sputtered another cough, eyes meeting Phil’s. \n\nHe smiled sadly, and in that moment I understood that I had to flee.\n\nI didn’t wait for Phil to follow, my legs pounding as I ran back towards the house, and away from that *thing*. \n\nThe entire entire world seemed to shake, the air itself somehow vibrating until I could feel it in my bones. A glance over my shoulder told me why, as I passed the side of the house we’d just exited, I caught sight of the object descending until it was barely thirty feet or so off the ground.\n\nIt was bigger than I’d imagined, at least the size of three school buses in length, and by the look of it, it seemed entirely composed of some pale metallic substance, almost like a reflective marble. I lost sight of it as I neared the car, but I knew very well that it was directly overhead. \n\nIt made a…a sound, like the bellow of some horrid, ancient beast had been run through autotune as it closed in on him, growing closer and closer until I could feel it, feel the static that seemed to radiate forth from it.\n\nI didn’t stop, even as the mechanical roar rose to a fever pitch, combining with a human shriek to form a sound so awful I’m sure it would haunt me for the rest of my life, if I expected that to be long. I chanced a singular glance over my shoulder before passing behind the house and into its backyard, and what I saw I still can’t be sure of.\n\nIt was as though Phillip’s body was…dissolving, coming apart in ribbons of flesh, the air around it visibly warped by some sort of energy that seemed to pour forth from that….thing, floating like another moon a few feet over his head.\n\nI kept running until there was nothing but the sound of my own breath and pounding heart, long after silence had settled over the town.\n\nAs shock began to take effect, the adrenaline wearing off and leaving me feeling bruised, battered, scared and alone, I found my way into the local public library.\n\nThat’s where I’ve been for the past few hours. I’m staying off the streets. It’s not safe, that thing could descend on me at any time and do…god knows what.\n\nI’m writing this because…well, because I’ve done all I can to try and reach out for help, to no avail. \n\nThere is little else in the silence for me to do but perhaps try and write some account of what happened here, in the off-chance that anyone finds themselves wondering about the town of Criers Creek, or the even more unlikely scenario they’re wondering about me.\n\nTo Clay and Phil’s families, if you’re seeing this and still remember them, I’m sorry. I never meant for this to happen.\n\nAnd to whoever is reading this, be willing to trust the people around you sometimes. And stay away from Crier’s Creek, there is something in the skies above, something that has claimed this place as its own.",

        "text": "I got a call from my dad just as I was about to take my daily dose of Prozac.\n\n“How are you?” he asked cheerfully.\n\n“I’m fine,” I lied and downed the capsule.\n\n“Well, that’s great,” he said, not sounding convinced. “That’s great, Ben.”\n\n\"What’s up?\" I asked, eager to change the topic.\n\n“I, um,” he hesitated. “I know we’re seeing each other soon—and I guess this could’ve waited—but I just wanted to tell you that I went through everything in my basement last night and, um, well, I found some stuff I thought I had gotten rid of years ago.” He laughed nervously. “Just some of my old things from college and, um, from before your mom got sick.”\n\nI could tell he was struggling to find the right words.\n\n“It was kind of a trip down memory lane,” he continued. “Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that I found some of your old things, too. I thought you might want them.”\n\nJust thinking about my youth gave me anxiety, and I didn’t want to be reminded of it.\n\nMy childhood and teenage years were strange and sorrowful times. It’s fair to say they were my rise and fall. Eventually, I managed to gain friends, even a girlfriend, but in the end, I lost all of them and I never fully recovered from it. The fall wasn’t just metaphorical. At the end of eighth grade, in 1998, my girlfriend did the unthinkable. I have almost no recollection of this time in my life, but the vague image of her falling toward the schoolyard’s pavement persists in my mind; her white dress embracing her body as if she was carried down by a cloud. Sometimes I see this scene from above as if I’m soaring above like a bird, detached from everything, and sometimes I’m right there next to her. I remember the blood seeping out from beneath her, turning the dress crimson red. For a few moments, she was still alive. Our eyes met. And all I managed to say before she was gone forever was her name:\n\n“Julia.”\n\nShe was crying, and with her last gasp of air she formed the words:\n\n“You too, Benjamin?”\n\nMy life before the suicide was happy, and my life thereafter was clouded by a never-ending depression. Julia didn’t just end her own life; in a way, she ended mine as well. I just couldn’t bring myself back. It remained a mystery to everyone why Julia chose to end her life so abruptly, even though it was true that at the end an indistinct sorrow had taken hold of her spirit.\n\nI’ve tried to follow her example twice.\n\nDad’s mention of my old belongings brought these memories back, but it also—just for a moment—reminded me of one of my most recurring nightmares, and for some reason, it hit me differently this time. Me, running down a staircase that seemed to never end, my legs aching, my lungs burning. And at the bottom of the staircase was a door, and beyond that door was Julia. I could see her, waiting for me. But no matter how fast I ran, I could never reach her.\n\n“Ben?” my dad said.\n\nI shook my head to rid myself of the thought.\n\n“Y-yeah?”\n\n“I saw some of your old CDs in the box. I thought you might like to have those back, at least, considering you were practically addicted to them back then.”\n\nHe laughed, but I could still hear how concerned he was for my well-being, or perhaps how afraid he was that I was going to make another attempt at my own life.\n\n“You kept them?” I asked. “That’s pretty cool, Dad.”\n\nA small, almost imperceptible curiosity awoke within me. I loved those CDs. Some of them were legit titles, such as *The Queen Is Dead* by The Smiths and *Hagnesta Hill* by the Swedish rock-pop band Kent, but most of them were my own bootleg mp3 copies that I burned on CDs on my old Pentium II. In the end, I thought it couldn’t hurt too much to check them out.\n\nIt wasn’t until next weekend—a few days later than planned—that I finally pulled myself together enough to be able to leave the house and visit my dad. I opened the door to my old Volvo and sat down in the driver’s seat. I turned the key in the ignition, put the car in gear, and drove off. I dreaded going back to that part of town; just seeing it reminded me of all the pain I’d gone through. I thought about taking a detour to avoid my old school but decided against it. I didn’t want to give it that much power over me. Of course, a red light kept me stuck at the intersection right in front of it—the Royal Conservatory of Education. I looked over at the imposing stone building, watching the children play in the yard dressed in their little uniforms, oblivious to everything that happened there all those years ago. I took a deep breath and continued on my way.\n\nDad had cooked meatballs with mashed potatoes, my favorite dish before I lost my appetite, and invited me to sit down to eat with him. He asked me how things were going and I shrugged.\n\n“I’m okay,” I said, pushing the food around my plate.\n\nDad shook his head. “You’re not eating,” he said. “You’ve lost weight.”\n\nI shrugged again.\n\n“I’m sorry, I know you don’t like when I worry too much,” he said, “but I can’t help it. You’re my son after all. Anyway, um, how did that job interview go? What was it for again?”\n\nI had gone on a few job interviews, but I couldn’t bring myself to care about any of them. “It was fine,” I said. “I didn’t get it.”\n\nDad frowned. “That’s a shame. Maybe something will come up soon. It shouldn’t be a problem for you. Programmers are in high demand these days.”\n\nI knew he was just trying to make me feel better, but it wasn’t working.\n\n“Not depressed programmers,” I said with a bitter smile.\n\nDad sighed. “You’re still seeing that therapist, right?”\n\nI nodded. “Yes, I am.”\n\n“Good. I think that’s helping. You seem a little better. Telling a joke like that.” He smiled at me, but I just stared back at him.\n\nDad changed the topic after a few moments of awkward silence. “So, did you see the game last night?”\n\nFrom here, we didn’t touch upon anything too personal or deep. We just talked about sports and the weather like we always did. It was nice, in a way, but it also made me feel even more depressed. I was reminded of all the things I used to enjoy that I no longer had any interest in.\n\nIt wasn’t until it was time for me to go back home that he gave me the old, tarnished cardboard box.\n\n“Maybe it will bring back some memories,” he said.\n\nI could see the pity in his eyes.\n\n“I kind of hope it won’t.”\n\nLater that night, I removed all the dishes from my small kitchen table and placed them in my over-stuffed sink. I stood in from of the table for a moment, gathering the courage to face my past. I reached down and picked up the box, placing it on the table with trembling hands. I ran my fingers along the top of the box, tracing the words that Dad had written there in black permanent marker. “Ben’s stuff.” Just two words, and yet they held so much meaning.\n\nIt surprised me how nervous all of this made me. The scent escaping the box after I opened it gave me an instant flashback to my old room at my dad’s place, specifically to a random memory of me sitting on the bed together with Julia. One of those days when we had spent the entire evening playing computer games. *Why did you do it?* I had stopped trying to explain it a long time ago, but now—just for a second—the question returned to my mind. It made me uneasy.\n\nI swallowed hard and reached for the things in the box. At the top was a Tamagotchi, an empty *Toejam &amp; Earl* cartridge, and among some stickers and Kinder Egg toys, my old Nokia 3310. There was also the red beret that Julia had forgotten at my place sometime before she killed herself. I held it for a couple of seconds, listening to my heavy heartbeats.\n\nBeneath this were some drawings and schoolbooks and under that, hidden at the bottom, my old CDs. All of these things were from before it happened, when I still knew what happiness felt like. The nostalgia I felt seeing these items wasn’t exactly a positive feeling, but at least it was a *feeling*. I almost couldn’t remember the last time I had one, other than numbness.\n\nI remembered most of the CDs, but one of them stood out to me. I had written “backup” on it with a red marker. I put one of the CDs in my stereo, and as “Bitter Sweet Symphony*”* by The Verve started playing, I walked over to my PC with the backup CD.\n\nIt contained an old folder where I had kept most of my stuff back in the day. It was named “Ben’s lair.” I double-clicked on it. Inside, there were a few more folders: “Small games,” “Music,” “School,” and, “Misc.”\n\nMost of the games were either too old for Windows 10 or were immediately stopped by Norton when I tried to transfer the files. The only software in that folder that worked properly was *Stray Sheep*, the Japanese screen mate. And as the small sheep ran around on my screen I went through the rest of the folders. The last one was, as expected, filled with random stuff. Old DLL files, logs from some FTP server, screenshots from old *StarCraft* matches, and other games that were big at the time. That sort of junk. I was just about to close the folder and call it the night when I noticed a file titled “proof 01.bmp”. My heartbeat increased steadily as I opened it, not sure exactly why.\n\nMy reaction when I saw the image that appeared on my screen was total confusion, followed by a cold sweat. For a few seconds, I couldn’t even comprehend what I was seeing, and after my mind had finally grasped it, I still didn’t understand what it meant. It was a picture of myself, not as a teenager but as a grown man. Next to me, with my arms around her, was Julia… older than she ever actually got to be. And we seemed to be just as happy as we had been back when we were together in high school.\n\nI quickly scrolled through the files again. There was one more picture, titled “proof 04.bmp.” In this picture, Julia was holding a speech in front of a large group of people.\n\n“What the hell *is* this?” I asked myself.\n\nIt felt like my mind was about to turn inside out. I went through everything on the CD meticulously, but there wasn’t anything more like this on it. I went back to the box on the table and dug into it in a frenzy, hoping to find some additional clues, but I couldn’t find anything else. I sat down on my chair and stared in front of me. My body was shaking and my head was spinning. *Is this some kind of sick joke?* It didn’t make any sense. Pictures of a life I never lived… a happy life. Pictures of a life with Julia! It made me furious to see what I could have had if Julia hadn’t killed herself. All the feelings I had suppressed for so long, all the questions I had pushed aside… now they came flooding back.\n\nI made one last attempt at finding something inside the box. This time, I found a bunch of printed pages, folded and put between the pages of a Donald Duck comic. *The Model* by Kraftwerk began playing from the stereo as I read the text on the pages. The first one was filled with instructions on how to mix some chemicals together. I dismissed it as old homework, but after I had read the rest of the pages, I realized the horrible truth behind them.\n\nTo make sense of the words on those pages, I have to share what happened to me in high school, no matter how painful it is for me to tell the story.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe bullying began as soon as I started school. It was all seemingly manufactured by one kid in particular: Oliver Rachtmeister. He successfully convinced everyone that there was something inherently wrong with me because I wasn’t as wealthy as he and his friends. I remember that I sat next to him in the assembly hall on my first day of school. He was wearing an immaculate white shirt, dark trousers, and polished black shoes. His dark hair was slicked back with some sort of gel. I was wearing a pair of hand-me-down jeans and a t-shirt with a cartoon character on it. I felt very out of place. I *was* very out of place.\n\nDuring the assembly, Oliver turned to me and whispered, “You’re poor, aren’t you?”\n\nI didn’t know how to respond, so I just nodded.\n\nHe stared at me with contempt in his eyes. “I can tell. It’s written all over your face.”\n\nI was so embarrassed and ashamed that I wanted to disappear. I wished that the ground would just open up and swallow me whole.\n\nThis marked the beginning of my hell on Earth. Oliver and his friends would trip me up in the corridors, push me around in the playground, and call me names. I was too scared to tell anyone—not even Dad, especially not Dad—because I didn’t want to be a disappointment. So, I just suffered in silence. I tried my best to ignore them, but it was hard. Some days, I would come home from school and just sit in my room and cry. I felt so alone and helpless.\n\nDad noticed I wasn’t as happy as before, but I kept lying to him every time he asked what was wrong. I didn’t want to worry him or make him think I was weak. Had I told him, I’m sure he would’ve gone to the school and given Oliver and his friends a piece of his mind. But I didn’t want that.\n\nOne day, after yet another humiliating experience at school, I came home and curled up in a ball on my bed and cried. I felt like I couldn’t take it anymore. I was tired of being the outcast, the one who didn’t fit in. I was tired of being bullied. I was tired of being poor. And I was tired of being tired.\n\nI don’t know how long I lay there, but at some point, I must have fallen asleep because the next thing I remember is Dad shaking me awake.\n\n“Wake up, sleepyhead. I’ve got something to show you.”\n\nI rubbed my eyes sleepily and sat up.\n\n“What is it?” I asked, still half-asleep.\n\n“Come and see for yourself,” he replied, a smile in his voice.\n\nI followed him downstairs, yawning and stretching. When we entered the living room, I stopped in my tracks and stared.\n\nThere, sitting on the coffee table, was a brand-new Macintosh Quadra 650.\n\nI couldn’t believe it. Dad must have saved up for months to get me this computer. I gave him a hug and thanked him profusely.\n\n“I know you’ve been going through a tough time lately,” he said, “and I thought this might help you take your mind off things.”\n\nThis wouldn’t change much, but it meant the world to me. This was the kind of thing Oliver and his friends would have, not me. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I belonged, or at least as if I wasn’t as good for nothing as Oliver and his friends made me out to be.\n\nAt school, everything continued as before, but now I had something to look forward to when I came home. I could escape into my own world where I was the hero, not the outcast. I could be anyone I wanted to be and do anything I wanted to do. And, for a little while, I forgot all about my problems.\n\nThere were moments I thought the bullying would stop and that I would finally be treated like an equal. Those rare occasions always gave me hope, but it always ended the same way. One time, I was invited to come along to the candy store during recess. On the way there, they all stopped in their tracks and looked at me foolishly as I continued walking a few steps. Then the boys jumped at me while the girls laughed. I had a crush at that time on one of the girls who laughed. I was reduced to tears and ran home. Another time, they came to my birthday party that my dad had arranged. Before they left, Oliver had spit in the slot of my “stupid” Genesis console and whispered to his friends to ruin my collection of hockey cards.\n\nThe bullying made it difficult for me to focus on school. I had no problems with my attention in general. For example, I had already learned HTML on the computer my dad had bought me. It was just school I couldn’t handle, the constant harassment made sure of that.\n\nThe teachers were blind to what was going on, or perhaps they didn’t want to acknowledge that they had problems. In either case, it was all allowed to continue. And when I started to ditch gym and fell behind on almost all subjects—even math, which I was actually good at—the teachers decided I was a problem. They couldn’t understand, or wouldn’t admit, that the good pupils were the reason I was failing. It didn’t help that some of those pupils were the sons and daughters of some of the richest people in the country, only because the school happened to be located in one of the wealthiest areas in the city. Oliver was one of those pupils. One of the untouchables.\n\nLuckily, my school was small and only had classes up to third grade. After that everyone had to go to one of the larger schools. That was when all the rich kids got separated from the poorer ones, and I had always held up hope that my suffering would end as soon as it was time for me to change schools.\n\nHowever, when the day finally arrived, the principal convinced my dad that I needed special education because of how far behind I was, and apparently the most prestigious school in the city—that only the richest families could afford to place their children in—had recently begun to accept special needs kids as a humanitarian effort. This was presented to my dad, who could never have afforded for me to attend that school, as good news. There was excitement in the room when it was decided over my head that I would be going to that school… to the Royal Conservatory of Education. Dad finally saw some light at the end of the tunnel, almost as if he thought that the sheer association with that school would turn my life around completely.\n\n“A lot of your friends are going there as well,” the principal said. “Isn’t that great?”\n\nI looked down at my hands, feeling the hair stand up on my neck.\n\nI was put in a class with only seven students, all suffering from different mental disabilities I didn’t have. This ruined my chances of starting over. And of course, my so-called friends were none other than Oliver and his friends. They made sure the bullying continued. I was constantly picked on not only for getting special education but also for somehow trespassing and intruding. It didn’t matter that I was given the same fancy school blazer as everyone else. I didn’t belong, and they made sure I would never forget it. Everything they accused me of was now proven to be true in their cruel eyes. Why else would I attend a class with mentally disabled children? This was the worst-case scenario. For the first time, I contemplated killing myself.\n\nBut then everything changed. And this, I suppose, is where my story truly begins. I was standing in line at the canteen. I was just about to enter it when Oliver turned around and pushed me back down the line. The kids behind me pushed me back further and the kids behind them did the same and so on and so on. I broke down somewhere halfway toward the end of the line. I hated it, I hated that I couldn’t stop those damn tears from coming. My tears always proved them right, proved that I was just as weak as they said. They laughed as they pushed me down the line, and I cried as they pushed me over the edge. This would’ve been the last straw for me, the true end of the line, but instead of that natural conclusion to a story that’s been told one too many times, I finally bumped into someone who didn’t push me further back. Instead, I found myself embraced in a warm hug. A feeling I had never felt before in my entire life blossomed in my chest, pressing my despair back up my throat and turning my tears into tears of relief. I know it might sound ridiculous, but what I felt at this moment was nothing less than a miracle.\n\nBefore I even saw her face, she whispered into my ear almost as if she had known me my entire life:\n\n“Things will be different from now on.”\n\nI stepped back to see who had just unknowingly saved my life. She had a gentle smile and innocent eyes, which was strange considering her sharp gaze which was like a bird of prey. She removed some of her black hair sticking out from her slightly off-centered red beret from her face and asked me for my name. I stuttered it between my sobs.\n\n“I’m Julia,” she said with an Italian accent. “This is my first day.”\n\nEveryone standing in line had turned their heads, watching Julia with curiosity, fascination, and perplexity. And at the end of the line, in the doorframe to the canteen, Oliver stared at us with his dark eyes as if he had witnessed something beyond his comprehension.\n\nIt might be that I only remember it this way, but this blip in time felt eternal. During those few seconds, it felt like we all stood inside a photograph that depicted a turning point in our lives.\n\nJulia wasn’t prettier than any of the other girls—that’s not the way she stood out—it was just that she exuded a form of undeniable confidence that immediately demanded respect from the people around her.\n\n“Walk with me,” she said and proceeded up the line with me at her side.\n\nShe introduced herself to each and every person, offering them a handshake while looking at them as if she could read them like open books, and they all unconsciously straightened their backs as they received it. Oliver quickly fixed his hair as we approached him, nervously looking at me and then back at Julia. It was obvious that he had already begun to fall in love with her, just like that, and that he could no longer hurt me as long as he wanted her to like him. It made him confused and more than likely secretly annoyed.\n\nWhat had happened spread quickly throughout the school. Everyone loved Julia. In a way, it was almost as if she was my total opposite. She was loved just as quickly as I had been hated. I saw the popular girls fighting over her attention, trying to make her their friend, and the boys—especially Oliver—swarmed around her like bees surrounding honey. In just a few weeks, Julia had altered the dynamics of the entire school. It was as if she had been a missing piece to a puzzle that was now finally complete. I was still mostly alone, it wasn’t like anyone wanted to be my friend all of a sudden, but I was also *left* alone, which of course had a huge impact on my life.\n\nA few months later I was sitting alone in the school library, playing around with Visual Basics on one of the few computers at the school. The library was an impressive room, with high ceilings, chandeliers, and wooden shelves filled with books. The computers, placed on large desks in the center, were the only thing that seemed out of place. They were new and modern, while everything else was old and classic. I often came here to work on my programming projects. It was also a refuge from everyone else at the school. Here, I didn’t have to worry about fitting in or being cool. I could just be myself without anyone judging me.\n\nOn this particular day, something odd happened. As I sat typing away at the computer, I could faintly hear the choir practicing in the music hall nearby. The sound of their voices singing *Miserere Mei Deus* drifted into the library, adding soothing background noise to my work. Then, the large doors opened behind me. I heard the librarian whisper a soft hello and then footsteps stop right next to me. I turned around to see who it was, and my heart skipped a beat when I saw that it was Julia.\n\n“What are you doing?” she asked.\n\nHer voice was smooth, but at the same time authoritarian. Listening to her both fascinated and frightened me.\n\n“Um,” I said. “I-I’m good, I—”\n\n“You know how to code?” she interrupted. “Can you teach me?”\n\nI was dumbfounded and looked at her without knowing what to say.\n\n“Well?” she said. “The world is changing faster than anyone is realizing, and you need to know how to code if you want to stay ahead.”\n\n“S-sure,” I said, my heart drumming out of happiness in my chest. “I’ll teach you.”\n\nThis was the second time she would disrupt my life. I had never had a friend before, but this was the day that changed. My confidence was too low for me to consider the possibility of more than friendship, but slowly but surely, I began falling in love with her. Just like everyone else. I couldn’t help it. It might be that I would have fallen for any girl that showed me the slightest bit of affection, but there was something truly compelling about Julia that made her seem almost too good for this world. My feelings for her quickly became my deepest secret, partly because I was afraid it would ruin our friendship if I ever told her.\n\nWe met up at the library every day, and after a few weeks—after she called me at my home out of the blue—we began talking over the phone during the evenings. She was a guarded person, and most of the time she only wanted to talk about programming, but from time to time she opened up and told me some of her deeper thoughts and emotions. The time I remember the most is when she told me what happened to her older sister.\n\n“We went to the same school,” she said. “That’s actually why I had to change schools because one of the guys who raped her went to her class. I couldn’t stand seeing him every day, you know. There wasn’t sufficient proof against him and his friends.” She tried to tell me this in her normal voice, but I could sense the hatred behind her words. “No one denied the act, it was that they couldn’t prove that *she didn’t want it.* That was the problem. But who wants to have sex with several guys at once like that? She was high, dressed ‘the wrong way’, and had a sexual relationship with one of them and they all said she wanted it…” The last words that came out of her mouth felt like a punch to my stomach: “She killed herself the same day they all walked free.” I was silent on the other end of the line, unsure of what to say. “They all belonged to the same street gang,” she continued. “They called themselves Los Bárbaros.”\n\nJulia never spoke of this again and I never brought it up, but it was clear that it was something she always carried around. It would help me understand some of the things that happened later on, but during the rest of fifth grade, I didn’t think much more of it. We were still just kids messing around in Windows NT 3.5.\n\nJulia learned impressively fast and soon surpassed me, but she still joined me in the library during recess even after she didn’t need my help anymore. In fact, it was now she who helped me. Of course, she didn’t waste all of her time on me. She gave everyone the attention they craved, even Oliver, although she never reciprocated his feelings for her. As far as I could see, she never got involved with *anyone* in that way… which of course gave me hope. Even so, I knew that even though she had become the most important person in my life, I was one among many in hers.\n\nDuring summer break that year, we finally began seeing each other in our free time. I was never allowed to visit her place, but she often came over to my dad’s place and either played *StarCraft* with me or worked on some new project that we had going together. She said it wouldn’t be fun at her place anyway since she didn’t have an internet connection. It wasn’t that she was poor—far from it—just that the internet was a new deal. I myself used a 56k modem to dial up. Still, it was Julia who introduced me to the concept of hacking. She brought it up rather casually while we were finalizing a small DOS game which, until now, had been our main project.\n\n“We should become hackers,” she said, still standing at the door, smiling innocently beneath her beret.\n\nI laughed, guessing she was joking. “Yeah, right.”\n\n“I’m serious!” she said and basically forced herself inside. “Think about it. Soon the entire world will run on computers. I just want to stay ahead, you know.”\n\nShe gave the impression that she said these things and came up with these ideas on a whim, but I always felt like she had actually put a lot of thought behind it, almost as if she was acting out steps in a complicated plan that she wasn’t sharing with me. She always said she wanted to stay ahead like she was in a race not to fall behind the wheel of time. I didn’t ask that many questions, though, since it was nothing more than a hunch anyway. In either case, this was the third time Julia changed my life.\n\nFor the rest of the summer, we changed our approach and began studying ways to make computer viruses and other malicious software. Ironically, this meant that we spent just as much time at the public library reading magazines and books on encryption as in front of our computers. I was pretty good at math, even as a thirteen-year-old, but reading didn’t do that much for me since the best way for me to learn was by doing. Julia on the other hand could do both, although at times she was frustrated with certain concepts, and she managed to implement what she learned rather quickly.\n\nWe didn’t make anything impressive during this time, just some files that in theory could destroy or damage the victim’s computer. Since we didn’t have access to that many computers, we couldn’t really test our files. We only managed to “nuke” a library computer by putting one of our files on a floppy disk that we inserted into the machine. It made me feel conflicted; on one hand, I was glad that our work had paid off, but on the other, I realized that we had just done something really bad. Not only that, but I was also afraid we would get into trouble. Julia, on the other hand, didn’t show any sign of either fear or remorse. She just looked at me with a satisfied smirk on her face and said:\n\n“This is the beginning of something beautiful.”\n\nWhen school started, they had placed more computers in the library and installed Windows 95 on them. We didn’t want to damage them with our files, but we did test some of the less destructive ones and also began researching how to hack into the system so that we could access whatever it was the teachers were doing. At the same time, the messenger client ICQ became popular, and that changed the ways we interacted with each other and with the other kids at school. Everyone added Julia, and she managed to convince almost everyone to download the program to stay in touch, but for a long time, my list only had her nickname on it: Minerva.\n\nIt was around this time that she told one of her classmates—a boy named Victor—about a file she said I had made. We had made it together, but I guess she didn’t want anyone to know about her involvement. It was a file that she had named Obitus. Victor sent it over to someone else, telling him or her that it was a game, and when he got confirmation that the file had crashed the victim’s computer, he added me on ICQ and told me how impressed he was with what I had made. This was another turning point. Slowly, a rumor began spreading, thanks to Julia, that I was a hacker—much more competent than I actually was—and more and more of the other boys at school began adding me on ICQ. Julia kept this rumor alive, and I didn’t question it because deep down I liked the attention.\n\nI gave away some of the less harmful files that we had made. The most popular one was a file that generated several folders on the desktop with forbidden characters in their names which meant that they could only be deleted from the DOS prompt. Since most people didn’t know how to do that, they were stuck with all those folders on their desktops.\n\nI was even approached in school by pupils who not only wanted to use our files but also learn how to make their own. Oliver, who had refrained from bullying me since the day Julia started at our school, took notice. His hate for me was still burning in his chest even though he had tried to hide it, and one day he decided to jump me out of the blue. He grabbed my arm, spun me around, and threw me to the floor. One of his classmates intervened.\n\n“Dude,” he said, “stop. Don’t you know what he can do?”\n\nOliver stopped, not so much because of what I could do, but because he didn’t get the reactions from his friends that he had hoped for. It confused him, and therefore even more enraged, but there was nothing he could do. Julia showed up a few moments later, forcing a fake smile on Oliver’s face. He patted me on the shoulder.\n\n“We were just having some fun.”\n\nShe said she needed to talk to me. I followed her to the cafeteria. As always, everyone looked at her when she entered the room. I ordered a toast and sat down with her. I could tell from the eagerness on her face that she had come up with a new idea, or at least that she was ready to inform me about it. She gave me her usual smile, almost as if she felt she had to make an effort to convince me, and said:\n\n“Don’t you think we should do something good with all of this?”\n\n“What do you mean?” I asked.\n\n“Right now, our friends are using our stuff to fuck with people. There is no thought behind it. There are so many bad people out there, you know, and more and more of them are coming online. We should send our files to them, not just to random strangers. Innocent people don’t deserve to have their computers destroyed. We’ve some people who are eager to help now—it doesn’t just have to be you and me—we just need to give them a *direction*. You know what I mean? We need to add a sense of *purpose* behind their actions.”\n\n“What are you suggesting?” I asked, afraid of the words “not just you and me” since it sounded a little bit like she wasn’t satisfied with hanging out with me alone.\n\n“We should organize!” She gave me a huge smile. “I think it will be fun. We’ll do it together, okay?” I felt relief hearing those words. “We’ll begin with something simple.” She paused as if to think, as always just as if she was coming up with her ideas on the fly even though they seemed thoroughly thought out. “Let’s begin with establishing a chain of command. I don’t think it will be possible to have two leaders, at least not officially, so even though we decide everything together I can take the role of leader while you become my number one—so to speak—and therefore second-in-command. Are you with me so far?”\n\n“Y-yeah, but what are we talking about here—” I began.\n\n“My idea is that everyone who wants to use our files has to join our little organization, and they will be given a specific rank or whatever depending on how good they are. We give them missions—or targets if you like—and depending on how well they perform they can climb in rank. At least within their own group.”\n\n“Group?” I asked. “There’s more than one?”\n\n“Doesn’t that make sense?” she said. “If we allow for several hierarchies, there will be more room for advancement among our members and therefore a greater motivation among them to fight for a higher rank. We need to foster ambition if we want this to work. So, we should have several groups, maybe based on which class you’re in or maybe based on who you’re friends with or both, and they should all have their individual commander who is sworn in by us. I strongly believe this project has potential.”\n\nI must have looked like a living question mark when she told me all this and I nodded along with a stupid-looking smile. Julia remained silent for a minute, rocking her chair, and said, “So many are joining different street gangs, you know, and then there’s the skinheads recruiting people even from our school. I just think we should offer an alternative with a vision behind it. An organization that’s fighting for something good!”\n\nLater that night, I saw that she had added “Imperial Legate” in brackets before her nickname on ICQ. She wrote to me as soon as she saw that I came online: “Hey! Please add the following in front of your username the same way I did: Legion Legat. That’s your title.”\n\n“What does it mean?” I asked, and at the same time, she told me.\n\n“It’s the post beneath mine. You’re the overall legion commander and I’m, officially, the commander of legion commanders. It’s just a formality, really. I’ve decided that we should name our organization Legion Zero, which justifies this ranking system. I just thought it was cool. Do you like it?”\n\n“Um, sure… but imperial? Isn’t that a bit too much?” I added a smiley.\n\nIt took a while for her to answer, which made me nervous, but then I heard the “uh-oh!” sound from ICQ and immediately opened our message box.\n\n“It makes sense, trust me.” No smiley. “Every commander will have to add ‘Centurion’ before their names, and their soldiers—the ordinary legionaries—will add their commander’s initials and a number signifying their rank before their names. It’s super simple. Every cohort will have its own centurion who commands a set of soldiers, and together we all form Legion Zero. Anyway, all we have to do now is recruit the first centurions and fill the [ranks](https://www.reddit.com/r/tobiasmalm/comments/112r4le/i_just_released_my_novel_the_cave_to_another/)!”",

        "text": "Hi... It's me, Travis Marcella. If you don't know what has happened previously then these are my previous posts...\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11kc214/i_didnt_follow_my_fathers_rules_and_ive_uncovered/), [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11lavnl/i_didnt_follow_my_fathers_rules_and_now_something/), [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11mik5w/i_didnt_follow_my_fathers_rules_and_now_im/), [Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11p1o9e/i_didnt_follow_my_fathers_rules_and_now_im_a/).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up gasping for air. Another bad dream... These have been happening recently but I never remembered them despite waking up terrified. I got out of my bed and left the room I was in.\n\nIt seemed a bit quiet today, I watched as some scientists were rubbing their eyes as they left their rooms. I quickly made my way to the medical bay only to run into Bryson.\n\n\"Hi Bryson\". I said.\n\n\"Hello, Travis\". He said, darting his eyes around before leaning in close to me.\n\n\"Don't do anything stupid. The Inspector's are here\". He whispered and quickly hurried off.\n\nI wanted to ask who the inspector's were but he was already gone. I continued through the halls, searching for where the medical bay was until I finally found it. I reached to open the door when I noticed two large signs above the door. It said \"Employees\" and the other one said \"Patients\". I shuddered as they were referring to cryptids as patients. I walked into the door that was below the sign saying \"Patients\"...\n\nI walked inside to see many steel doors with labels on the side. I looked inside tiny windows and saw many horrible things. One was a long, stretched out creature with white skin. It has dark eyes and it was screeching endlessly behind the soundproof walls. Another was a large octopus that seemed to be able to breath out of water. I watched as it showed it's many sharp tentacles and bumps on its skin that billowed large portions of dark grey gas into the air.\n\nI continued forth but after 10 minutes of searching through many rooms, I couldn't find Darius. I heard some guards coming and hid in a random room in the far back... Only to be met with Darius himself. He was in a large cage and had many bandages on his arms.\n\n\"Darius\"? I asked, hoping he was awake.\n\nI watched as he pulled himself off of the floor and looked shocked to see me.\n\n\"Travis, what are you doing here\"?! He said in a booming voice. \n\n\"I was just checking up on you-\" I said but he cut me off.\n\n\"No... You don't understand. The only people allowed here are scientists. You will be killed if you are caught\"! He said frantically.\n\n\"I can't leave, there are guards outside this room\"! I loudly whispered as shadows appeared in the window. I felt my heart race as the shadow drew closer....\n\nSuddenly, I was back in my father's cabin. I looked around in shock to see my father fighting off a large spider. I tried to tell him to get out of the way but I couldn't speak. Another spider landed on top of him and they both tore him to shreds....\n\n\"Travis...travis....TRAVIS\"!! Darius yelled, sending me out of my nightmare.\n\nI was on the floor when I heard the door click. I quickly rolled under the table as 2 guards walked in with a scientist.\n\n\"Hello again, Subject B21, I am Inspector Harrison and I have brought special news for you today\".\n\n\"My Name Is DARIUS\". He said coldly.\n\n\"We will not call you by a deluded nickname you gave yourself\". The inspector retorted.\n\n\"I have come to inform you that you are going on a special mission, if you are able to complete the mission, we will possibly hire you on division 6. If not, then you will die\". The inspector stated and grinned as the words sunk in.\n\n\"What is the mission\"? Darius asked.\n\n\"Well, It is classified and unlike our...\"director\", everyone else doesn't give out information like Halloween candy\". He spat, obvious hate in his voice.\n\n\"You're leaving tomorrow, whether you like it or not\". The inspector finished and left with the guards.\n\nI crawled out of my hiding spot and looked at Darius to tell him something but he spoke up before me.\n\n\"I... Travis, you are not to burden yourself with me, even if we are... best friends. I am probably going on a mission to my death and I don't want you taking part in it. Please... just go\". He said grimly.\n\n\"N-No, We are friends Darius. I am not going to just leave you to die\"! I protested.\n\n\"I'll break you out of here, later tonight, 9 PM. alright\"? I stated.\n\n\"Travis...You can't do this alone\". He said.\n\n\"you're right.... And that's why I have someone helping me\", I said confidently.\n\nHe sighed and sat back down in his cage. I took one last look at my best friend before leaving, I was going to break him out of there.\n\nThe rest of the day went by in a blur. I talked to Bryson and convinced him to help me with breaking out Darius. We had gotten everything prepared and tonight, we were all going to escape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt 8 PM exactly, I got out of my bed and left my room, immediately running towards a familiar room. I put on a pair of oddly shaped glasses that was in a bucket nearby, as well as some headphones. I waited as Bryson made his way over here and did the same thing I had done. We opened the door and  didn't look directly at the orbs as we let them out, The glasses protected us from most of their abilities but If we looked at them directly, we would be susceptible to the effects. They immediately flew towards us but we darted away, towards the room with the monster that had previously broken containment. We let him out and he ran towards us but was pretty slow for a cryptid.\n\nWe continued letting out many other Cryptids like Wendigo's, Giant worms, and many others. After we let out atleast 10 of the cryptids, we ran towards the medical bay. Bryson took out a gun and immediately started firing into the room and killing 2 of the 3 guards at the scene. The 3rd took cover and went to pull out his gun but Bryson was REALLY good at shooting guns because he sent a shot that ricocheted  off the wall behind the guard and killed him. \n\nWe ran to Darius's Cell and tried our best to break open the cage but It was no use. We were not strong enough. I found a key in one of the cabinets nearby and unlocked the cage, letting out Darius and escaping the cell just as the alarms went off that a breach had happened. The cell we were just in snapped shut and bolted itself in the blink of an eye. \n\n\"Travis...Thank you\". Darius said, a smile forming on his face.\n\n\"No problem, Darius\". I said as we ran down the corridor.\n\n\"Alright big guy, it's your turn to help us now. Break open this door and we are home free-\" Bryson was cut off by the click of a gun behind us.\n\n\"No...\". I whispered to myself.\n\nInspector Harrison walked toward us, a crazed smile on his face as he aimed the gun directly at Bryson.\n\n\"Well...Well...well...\". He said with a bemused look on his face.\n\n\" Subject B21, trying to escape I see?\". He taunted.\n\n\"You won't get away with this\"!! I yell.\n\n\"Get away with what? Preserving our race? Saving INNOCENT lives? You really are deluded, Kid. You were never meant to be here. Another mistake by the \"Director\". He sneered.\n\n\"You can't justify doing experiments on cryptids that mean NO harm\"! Bryson said. \"I've worked at this place for the past couple months and the only thing I learned was that the only people who work here are those who were lied to... OR PSYCHOPATHS LIKE YOU\"! Bryson ranted.\n\n\"Tch, you weren't a valuable asset anyway, Davidson\". He said.\n\nWe heard the guards enter the hallway and surround us, guns pointed at every one of us. Bryson attempted to aim and fire at Harrison but the guards saw this and one of them shot the gun out of Bryson's hand. We were all detained and we were about to be sent to the Director when the familiar orbs appeared and started attacking everyone nearby.\n\nI grabbed Bryson and went to run but the orbs were upon us. I closed my eyes but nothing happened. I opened my eyes again to see Darius grab the orbs with his large paw and thrust the orbs into the wall nearby. They were destroyed. Darius then quickly got to work decimating any remaining guards. \n\nI saw Harrison run off and went to go after him when a familiar face appeared. The Cuspid from the previous breach launched at me and tackled me to the ground. I punched and kicked at the cryptid but it was no use. It drew It's large mouth closer, preparing to take a bite out of my chest when Darius thrust his fist into the monster, destroying its skeletal structure. \n\n\"Darius you saved me\"? I was astonished.\n\n\"That's what best friends are for...right\"? He asked but was interrupted by a growl.\n\nThe Cuspid got back up, looking as if it was brand new and charged at us again. It latched onto Darius and began biting at his head,  putting immense pressure on Darius's skull. \n\nI thought Darius was done for when a shot ran off and the Cuspid was sent flying back by a bullet from Bryson's direction. Me and Darius looked back to see that Bryson had one of the guards' guns'. We immediately went to the door and Darius smashed his fist into it until it had broken completely off its hinges. We all were able to get out and Darius placed the door back in case the Cuspid regenerated before we could escape.\n\nWe ran towards the treeline to make an escape when I realized we weren't gonna make it far on foot. I told the others about this and Darius grabbed me and Bryson and placed us on his back. I was confused but then I realized he had been walking really slow the entire time so he didn't get ahead of us. He was surprisingly fast for how large he was and the facility was fading from the horizon in minutes.\n\nAfter about an hour, Darius took a break from running and me and Bryson looked around for anything to inform us of the location we were in. We were able to find a motel not far off where me and Bryson slept in (Darius preferred sleeping outside). We had barely enough cash for one night at the motel and we had no supplies or food. We asked the clerk where we were and apparently we were at Yellowstone National Park. Crazy Coincidence.\n\nDarius decided to scare away the people in the motel after me and Bryson cut the power. It worked flawlessly and we now had a place to sleep for a few days and a bunch of supplies. We found backpacks and stocked up on food and other necessities like water and gear for the next couple weeks. \n\nI thought we were in the clear when we saw a note at the front desk of the motel when we came back from exploring Yellowstone National Park that evening.\n\nIt read.\n\n\"**Hello subject B21, You have not escaped us nor will you ever. You are to complete the mission here or die along with your friends. You can be forgiven as you are a beast and not as intelligent as other species. If you fail this mission then you are to be terminated and killed.** \n\n**Your mission is to explore the forest of Yellowstone National Park and look for anything out of place. If you encounter a pilgrim-**\" \n\nDarius ripped the paper into shreds in a bout of fury and slammed his fists onto the front desk.\n\n\"Jeez, They insulted you and want you to do their dirty work? Harsh\". Bryson said.\n\nBryson was built like your average cop and acted like one too, he had black hair and was around 5'11. He had a deep tone but not as deep as Darius's. I watched as he sighed and handed me his gun.\n\n\"Hey- I have an AK47 so you can have this, treat her well\". He said, handing me his desert eagle.\n\n\"T-Thanks\" I Said.\n\nWe all went to seep rather quickly that night...well, except me. I was determined to figure out what I was having nightmares about. I started reading some books about the human psyche but I could barely understand the words. I should have paid more attention to my English teacher I thought to myself, decided to go to sleep... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up in a thick forest, filled to the brim with shadows, all of them looking at me and laughing. I tried to escape but MY father grabbed me and dragged me toward the shadows. I screamed and kicked but it seemed like it was no use. I felt scratches edge into me and the shadows started crawling onto me. I kicked and squirmed, desperate to escape when I felt a sharp, cold sensation wash over me. I blinked to see me being held tightly by Darius as Bryson had a bucket of water in his hand, now empty as the water was now on the floor and on me and Darius. \n\nI was about to ask what was going on when Darius put his paw to my mouth and pointed towards the window where we all watched as armed guards entered the motel...\n\nBryson has an escape plan of jumping out the window but I doubt anyone but Darius could fall that far and still have their legs intact. Darius wants to barge through them all but me and Bryson both know It would most likely fail unless we had a good plan. \n\nI quickly typed this out to the only computer that was in my room as I think of a plan of escape. Darius said we could escape the window while holding onto him, It sounds like a plan.\n\nI'll keep you updated on the situation.",

        "text": "So in January, I bought my first apartment. It was a standard one-bedroom pet-friendly place. The neighbors were friendly some were too nice, but to be fair I have a wonderful thing called \\*generalized anxiety\\*, so I chalked it up to that. I, and my two cats, and lived on the second floor with a window facing the back parking lot, the layout was simple you walk into the kitchen that turns into a living room, and there's a closet by the door that I used as a pantry, and between the kitchen and living room you can turn right to see an entry into my bedroom and if you walk in there's another closet to the right and a bit to the left on the same wall there is the bathroom door hopefully I explained it well enough. It wasn't in the best part of town but not the worst, I tried not to go out at night but my job doesn’t have very flexible hours (I'm a mortician and we are understaffed so I have to take extra jobs around, I don’t mind though I like helping people even if they are dead) so about once a week I have to come home at night. I try not to worry about anything since I am a taller dude with some muscle but to be safe I bring a knife with me (I could, and maybe should've, bought a gun since I’m in America but I don’t trust myself with it, especially now that I’m on edge) every time I go out but thankfully nothing bad happened so I didn’t need to use the knife!\n\nEverything was going fine. I got used to my overly friendly neighbors and was pretty sure I saw everyone there. I was there for maybe two weeks when I walked into the lobby, after an absurdly long day, to a blood bath I had no clue who it was under the blood as they didn’t look familiar (he was the only one that tall, he probably was asked if he played basketball every couple hours) The blood was real and honestly, I thought I was gonna see him in a few days… but I didn’t he was rushed to the hospital after fainting less than 5 minutes before the ambulance arrived, but something seemed off about him I saw him through the window rushing in and he seemed superficially concerned when he saw me it turned to real concern. I tried not to think about it but his expression didn’t sit right with me, my therapist was surprised that was what I kept talking about, but I always had a high gore tolerance which went up even higher with my career.\n\nAbout a week after I decided to paint my bathroom since I hadn’t had time till now and I hadn’t realized until now that the mirror could come off and what I saw horrified me… there was a hole in the next apartment, which I hadn't met the owner of until I looked at the ring-up sheet (the thing in the entrance so visitors can be let in) it was owned by the stabbed man! I looked in the hole a bit more after I calmed down and it went to his bathroom which had some… things in it, specifically a car window breaker thing, a few knives (one looked like a butcher knife and another looked like a filet knife and there was a few more), and a ski mask! If he wouldn’t have gotten stabbed and beaten with a hammer due to a failed robbery I wouldn’t be here to write this message… it is now sinking in that he didn’t die… I feel sick. I'm gonna lay down… I think I need to get out of here… maybe get a gun.\n\nI just woke up about an hour later with a terrible headache but I know I need to get out of here. I'm packing some stuff up and I’m gonna stay at my mom's for a while. It’s such a shame I have to move out after not even 3 months, but it looks like I don’t have a choice.\n\nOk so I'm updating you at my mom’s house it took a bit longer due to the incident I’m about to explain.  So to start things off I went down and buckled the cat’s cages into the back seats and needed to grab the clothes that I left up there. As I was going up the elevator it felt like time froze nothing felt like it was moving as I could have sworn it took a half hour to go up one floor. After so long the doors opened and no one was there, thankfully, but it was eerily silent to the point where I could hear the ringing in my ears. I went in there, grabbed my bag, and ran out, as I turned the corner I saw someone step into the elevator but to be safe it wasn’t him I ran down the stairs and beat it down. As I was stepping out I heard the elevator open and I looked and it wasn’t him, but my adrenaline and anxiety were at an all-time high and I must have looked like a madman because the person who came out didn’t say a word, and she is always up for a chat and sits in the lobby a lot looking for some small talk. I walked out to the street and was about to book it when I saw him!\n\nHe started charging me with a lust for blood in his otherwise apathetic eyes! I saw his arsenal but he came at me with a pocket knife, weird… then I saw it was covered in caked blood, the way the crimson didn’t reflect on the man’s grisly hands will never leave my mind.  That was the last thing I remembered but from what I was told someone tackled him and subsequently pushed me to the ground knocking me unconscious with the blade nearly avoiding my colon!\n\nRight now I'm writing this on the way to a crisis center an hour and a half away. It is the only place that is near me where I can use my phone, as music is very important to me. I’ll try to update as much as I can, but I’m not sure if there is [anything else.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trygor/)",

        "text": "I can't believe that it took this long for her to get help. She's under surveillance now and I get to see her once a week. It's already March? I guess it started way back in November sometime, when the world was as gray as you can feel on the inside. But at first mom wasn’t crazy like that, not like after a while. In the beginning she was like, stressed out. More than usual. But whose mom isn’t stressed out?\n\nI wanted an iPhone 14. Needed it. And I made it clear. Nothing but an iPhone 14 for Christmas. Mom was like, no, your phone is fine, it works. But it was old. When she asked why I was so tired every morning I lied and said that it was a teenager thing, but in reality I was lying awake every night with a heavy lump in my stomach, listening to mom crying.\n\nI don’t think she knew I could hear her. When we talked about dad she made it sound like she was going to mourn and remember him forever, but she had moved on and she was feeling okay now. You can fake a smile and a hug and things like that, but you can’t fake that twinkle in your eye. And mom’s eyes were empty.\n\nAnd then it got worse than just being extra stressed out. When I came home from school some gray day in early December I yelled out to mom, but she didn’t respond. I checked the house, every room, before I went to the kitchen for a glass of water. Tried getting as little water as possible in the sink. Every year as it got colder outside the grease or something like clotted and clogged the pipes. With too much water in the sink it could be minutes before it flowed down, and sometimes I stopped and looked at the often murky water which slowly whirled down the greasy pipe, like a slow-motion maelstrom.\n\n“I’m down here,” mom yelled from the basement. “Turn the water off!”\n\n“Already did,” I said and went down.\n\nShe was to the right of the stairs, in the boiler room, with her hand on her waist and her bangs pasted to her forehead. She was standing in muddy water with rubber boots on and sighing.\n\n“It ends up here,” she said and nodded to the rusty floor drain I knew was hiding somewhere under the dingy water.\n\nThe floor was shining and wet. “Clog water from the kitchen,” mom said, reached for the small gardening shovel she used for the flowerbeds in the spring, and scooped water into a bucket.\n\nI don’t know how to explain the stench in the boiler room. It was like old grease and filth and kind of like shit. And stale and dampish. Really dampish.\n\nIt smelled like … clog water, I guess.\n\n“Are there no plumbers?” I asked a few days after we’d discovered the clog water.\n\nMom was back in the basement and scooping again. “No, we don’t need a plumber, we need the guy who cleans the pipes. And that guy isn’t available before Christmas.”\n\nI looked down in the green plastic bucket, at the water which was as gray as the weather and an ocean for boats of clotted grease and dark chunks of filth.\n\nWhen she was back down there the next day I wasn’t worried for real, but that stomach lump started making moves.\n\n“You have to scoop it,” she said without looking at me.\n\nBut there wasn’t even that much water. We tried not to use the faucet in the kitchen more than we needed.\n\n“You need help?” I asked and reached for the shovel.\n\nShe snatched it away from me with so much force and speed that I flinched. “No need. Don’t you have school?” she said.\n\n“It’s Saturday.”\n\n“Then rest up until Monday, I guess.” Her gaze was still focused on the water. What was she looking at?\n\n“It’s Christmas break. You know that. What the fuck are you doing, mom?”\n\nShe jerked and looked at me for the first time that day, a motion so quick that she slipped on the stone floor which probably had gotten really slippery from the rubber boots and greasy clog water combo. She struggled for a few seconds before she fell down into the clog water with a splash. In any other situation it would have been hilarious, like something from a fail compilation on YouTube. But now it was just tragic.\n\nAnd sort of scary.\n\nWhen you fall you have two options. Smile and laugh at it or get angry. But mom hardly reacted at all. Her eyes were drawn to the clog water and the hidden, rusty drain again, and I was forgotten.\n\n“Mom? You all right?”\n\nShe didn’t answer. Started scooping again, but now from a kind of sitting and at the same time lying position where she rested on her elbow.\n\n“Mom?”\n\nThe clog water smell made my insides squirm and I backed away. If she wanted to lay in the filth and clean up I was going to let her do it.\n\nI don’t know if she cried even more the following night or if it was just me listening more carefully. If I was more worried. When morning came she wasn’t in the house. Not on the first floor of the house. I knew where she was and the lump in my stomach grew bigger. And harder. Sharper.\n\n“Mom, you’re not coming up?” I realized I was tearing up and almost sobbing.\n\nMom was like lying on her side in the disgusting fucking clog water and scooped it into the bucket. The boats of filth and grease got stuck on her face and I would’ve thrown up if I’d eaten anything.\n\n“Mom?”\n\nNo answer. No reaction at all. Her eyes were focused on the clog water, right where the water bubbled up from the drain if you forgot the clogged pipes and used the faucet in the kitchen sink. I had just had some water run to make it colder, so I guess mom had gotten more to scoop.\n\nThe days went by and she continued scooping from the slowly disappearing pool of clog water. Sometimes I could hear a splash when she got up, and then another splash when she emptied the bucket in the toilet across from the boiler room. After that the scooping continued.\n\nIn between the days were the evenings, when she came up from the basement and reeked of clog water. She laid down in her bed, which also had started smelling dampish and was speckled by clotted grease, and she fell asleep instantly. I couldn’t be in her bedroom because of the smell. Sometimes I watched her from the other side of the half-closed door before I had to close it all the way. Because of the smell. And because I couldn’t stand watching her in a fetal position, crying in her sleep, with her hair all wet and greasy, in a bed of filth.\n\nMom came up from the basement during the evenings, until she stopped. One evening she chose to stay down there in the boiler room, and to be honest I wasn’t surprised. In some way I was expecting it.\n\nI wasn’t getting a new iPhone, that much I knew. Would there even be Christmas? Now and then I turned on the water in the kitchen just to fuck with mom, but I never got a reaction. She just kept on scooping. Scratching that spade against the stone floor and the clog water splashed in the bucket. Just the thought of the boiler room reminded me of the stench and made me nauseous.\n\nOne night, maybe four or five days before Christmas eve, I woke up with like a gentle calm in my chest. The scoop scratches I heard from the basement were slow and dull, but mom was still going down there. I don’t know if she ever stopped scooping. I realized that the calm came from mom not crying. It was around that time every night I usually woke up and listened to mom crying until my eyes were as muddy as hers.\n\nBut besides the recurring stone floor scratches from the basement, an almost sacred silence rested over the house. I got out of bed and walked slowly toward mom’s bedroom. At that time I didn’t know I was walking carefully because I was sneaking. Because I was afraid. Even to this day I can’t explain what scared me.\n\nMom’s room smelled even worse with clog water and filth. Blankets and pillows were on the floor and the sheet was stained by the dingy water. Here and there were the dark pieces of clotted grease. I had to squint into the darkness to see it and I was too afraid to turn on the lights, but the stains and grease reminded me of something.\n\nThe stain, which was as gray as the clog water and surrounded by yellow filth outlines on the sheet, could have been the shape of a person. The stain could look like a human with a body and arms and legs. And the dark grease flakes could be hair on the stain’s head, and maybe a horrid face staring back at me.\n\nI backed out of the room. The creeping discomfort moving restlessly in the back of my neck and spreading out towards my arms got worse. The creeping started stomping. Goosebumps made my arms itch. Mom had stopped scooping. There wasn’t a sound in the house, and I imagined mom sitting right under me staring straight up. Straight up at me, with a vacant glance. With eyes wet from clog water.\n\nAs slowly as before I went back to my bedroom, closed the door and lay down. As soon as I shut my eyes the scooping started again.\n\nIt went on like that until the day before Christmas. If mom had eaten anything the last few days I didn’t want to think about what it could be. And the more I tried not thinking about it, the more I imagined her eating the grease and drinking the clog water.\n\nIt went on like that until it ended. And it ended with a scream.\n\nMom was roaring from downstairs and I ran to the boiler room. Ran so fast that I tripped down the stairs and almost fell.\n\n“What is it?” I asked with a breath caught in my chest.\n\nShe didn’t answer. At least not with words. Another roar escaped her throat and she stared at the rusty drain. The floor was shiny from grease and mom was still wet through and filthy, but the water was gone. At last, she had scooped it all away.\n\nFinally, I thought, now things could get back to normal. And that was the only thought I had time for before mom started crying. It was not at all like the other times, all those nights when she’d been crying. Now it was unrestrained. Mom was crying disgustingly.\n\nThe tears, which were squeezed out from the eyes rather than pouring, were gray, murky and greasy. Now and then a dark grease flake or some other filth followed a tear down her face, and the cry smelled so dampish that it made me feel sick. Mom cried clog water.\n\n“I’m done,” she muttered and wiped clog tears against her already wet sleeve.\n\nThat’s when mom lost it for real. I asked how she was doing and the glance she gave me was so hollow it made my stomach squirm and I got this weird dizziness. She stood up, with the shovel still in her hand, and walked slowly towards me.\n\n“What are you doing? Mom!?”\n\nShe shuffled closer and I backed away. Slipped on one of all the stains from when mom had spilled from her bucket as she was running back and forth, emptying the water in the toilet. I fell down on my ass. Mom swung the shovel at me and I blocked it with my arm. At first I couldn’t feel anything, and then it stung and burned where the shovel’s point had cut a flesh wound on my forearm.\n\n“What the fuck mom!?” The words were clunky. Heavy from tears and desperation.\n\nShe was crying as well, but it was the disgusting clog water like before. When she raised the shovel again for a second swing I got up and struck her face with a closed fist. I had never punched anyone before and it hurt like hell. The pain pounded in my knuckles and radiated down my wrist. Mom’s nose cracked softly when it broke and she raised her free hand to catch the blood.\n\nBut there wasn’t any blood pouring. Just more clog water. Her nose blood was gray clog water.\n\nShe raised the shovel a third time and I pushed her back into the boiler room. Shut the door so fast that it brought a wind of clog stench with it. Mom yelled without words and I locked the door. She screamed until her voice gave away, but she kept on screaming, or at least trying.\n\nI don’t know for how long I was standing leaning at the locked door and crying, but eventually I couldn’t take it. I went up instead, and even if I couldn’t fully escape mom’s roars the change of floor made her duller.\n\nMy arm was hurting and I washed the wound in the kitchen. Picked clotted grease from my arm. Heard the drain gargle as the water disappeared down the clogged pipe, and then I heard nothing. I couldn’t hear mom. The roaring stopped and there was total silence for a few seconds, until she started scooping again. I stood and listened to the scratching against the stone floor until it stopped, and just as I expected mom started screaming again when she was done and the water was gone.\n\nI didn’t get an iPhone 14 for Christmas, but at least I had a Christmas celebration. Me and mom celebrated together down in the boiler room. She sat on the floor and scooped clog water into the green plastic bucket. I sat leaning against the wall and played games that lagged on my old phone. On the floor above us, in the kitchen, a small jet of water poured from the faucet and made sure that mom always had new water to scoop.\n\n“Merry Christmas, mom.”",

        "text": "I still have nightmares about the procedure. It’s been years now but the day still haunts my dreams. \n\nIt was 2 pm when I walked into the doctors office for my yearly check up. The sitting area had comfy, modern furniture and a nice light blue paint covering the walls making a light hearted and positive atmosphere. I walk up to the counter, sign my name on the check in seat and walk to the couch set on the far wall. I always liked to be aware of my surroundings, who’s moving where, what they are doing. \n\nThe office door opens, “Mr. Knight?” The nurse says with a warm smile. I stand up and make my way over to her. She smiles and instructs me to follow her. \n\n“Having a good day so far?” I ask her.\n\nWe turn the corner and walk down a long hallway to room 7. “Sure am, please, have a seat. What are you in for today?”\n\n“Just a yearly, but since I’m here, I’ve been having a lot of pain in my neck just under my jaw. Nothing too extreme, probably a 3 on a scale of 1-10.”\n\nShe smiles, “we’ll be sure to check that out. Anything else?”\n\n“No ma’am, I believe that’s it.”\n\nShe chuckles, “Excellent, the doctor will be in shortly.”\n\nShe leaves the room. The sound of the door softly clicking behind her. I’m left in the room, silent except for the humming of the fluorescent lights. \n\nThe knock on the door startles me, shaking me from a day dream. “Hey Knight, how you doin’ today”\n\n“Hey Ryan, not too bad, just some discomfort in my neck, I’m sure the nurse told you.” \n\nHe nods and moves over to the table. Like always first thing is vitals, after the routine oil and maintenance is done he moves to check out my neck. His fingers start just below the ear and work their way down the jawbone. He stops suddenly. His eyes widen. “What’s up? Everything okay?”\n\nHe looks at me intensely, “Knight, I’m going to have you do a MRI. You have a lump in your neck that causes some concern.” \n\nI start to sweat. “Follow the nurse down the hall, she will get you prepped.”\n\n“This is nothing to worry about right?”\n\n“I’m sure it’s fine Mr. Knight. Please put this on and lay on the table, this shouldn’t take long” The procedure was quick and so was the docs arrival. \n\n“Knight, it seems you have a tumor on your neck we will do some test and then you can go home. We will call you when the results get back.”\n\nThe next few days my mind raced. Is it cancer? Is this really happening? It can’t be? I eat healthy, I exercise, I don’t have a history of it. \n\nAs the days passed my thoughts turned towards the grave, growing darker, weighing heavier on my mind. The phone rings, after three days. “Hey Knight, I got bad news and I got good news.. it’s cancerous but we can cut it out. If you want the procedure we can schedule you in for tomorrow June 13th.” \n\n“That works I’ll be there, what time?”\n\n“8am you’ll be the first one.”\n\nThe receiver clicks. That night was brutal, my mind raced at all the possibilities. Sleep didn’t come easy and when it did the nightmares began. Finally the morning arrives and I head to the office. The sitting room seemed a little colder today. The lady behind the counter tells me to go to operating room 6. The walk felt much longer and gloomier than the one just days before. I sit down in the chair, my foot shaking. Ryan knocks and walks in. \n\n“Hey Knight go ahead and hop on the table. The anesthesiologist will be in shortly.”\n\nA minute later, the anesthesiologist is looking down at me explaining how the meds work and asking if I’m ready. I nod to scared to speak. He hooks up the mask to my face and injects the medication into me. I start to count backwards into nothingness. \n\nThe lights are bright and dancing in circles. My body is stiff, I can’t move. I hear some muttering. I see doctors in masks and green cloaks. I feel a slice at my neck. My eyes open in pain as I feel the sharp steel slowly insert next to my vocal cords. The blade drags down and around. I try and speak or wiggle any part of my body. My eyes darting around the room praying for this to end. My head shifts and I hear a scream. My eyes close. Everything fades to black.\n\nI see the lights as I come too. My neck is bandaged. I try to speak, but silence. The operating doctors offer sincere apologies and pay for the operation out of their own pockets along with any rehabilitation necessary. \n\nI see the doctors every night staring at me with malice, the smile turns into a sickening grin as they tear out my throat. It’s been years since I said my last words. I type this now to tell people what happened in hopes to ease some of the nightmares.",

        "text": "I don’t know what to do. I tried to call the police but the dispatcher thought I was crazy. Jesus, even I  think I sound crazy.\n\nI came to Joshua Tree a couple of days ago. It was sort of a treat. A chance to spend some time alone  somewhere beautiful, and chill out. I wanted to switch off. Maybe hike in the park.\n\nSo I booked this cool little one bed place out in the middle of nowhere that I found online. The  pictures were amazing; acres of rock and sand with a dirt road to nowhere. I thought I’d hit the  jackpot when I pulled up. Just me and my thoughts and the resident tarantula that wandered onto  the patio.\n\nWhen the night came and I heard the coyotes howl I was excited. I even found some tracks near the  house in the morning and took photos. As an English townie, the most interesting bit of wildlife I’d  been around before was a fox.\n\nI’d visited somewhere like Joshua Tree. It felt otherworldly. Like there were vibrations coming  up through my feet and raising the hair on the back of my neck. I was alone, I knew. But it was as if  I’d stepped under the eye of the desert. An instinctual sense that I was watched, and I was judged.\n\nIn the day I wandered the trails in silence and marvelled at roadrunners and rock formations. Then  every evening the coyotes sang as I decided, once again, that I would leave a nightlight burning.\n\nTonight felt like any other. I’d made a large coffee to go with a fast food burger I picked up on  the drive back from a trail. A family of jack rabbits live near the BBQ pit that’s maybe twenty feet from the house, so I decided to sit and enjoy an early dinner in their company.\n\nI’d just licked the last crumbs off my fingers when the rabbits went very still… then dashed into their  warren.\n\nI looked around.\n\nIt was the eyes I noticed first.  The coyote was very still, crouched amongst the brush less than fifteen feet away, and almost  invisible. It stared straight at me.\n\nThe first feeling I had was excitement. The animal was larger than I expected, nearly twice as big as a  fox, but not exactly threatening. I stood slowly, not wanting to startle it. Then I realised, it wasn’t  one coyote, but a pack. Maybe fifteen or more.  They sauntered from the bushes, unafraid and unwelcoming.\n\nMy spine prickled.\n\nI became aware all  at once that I was very alone and far enough from the house that I wouldn’t beat them in a race.  One coyote had been a thrill, but fifteen was a worry. Then the pack separated; five circling to the  left of the BBQ pit and three or four more heading straight at me.\n\n‘You shouldn’t run from a predator,’ I thought to myself.\n\nTaking up the coffee mug as the only  weapon to hand. I backed towards the house slow and steady; I couldn’t afford to trip.  For every step I took, they stalked closer. Just wary enough not to close the distance but one, a  scarred and lean animal, must have been less than six feet away when my foot finally touched the  patio pavers. The thin thread of bravery I’d clung to broke and I dashed into the house, hands  shaking so hard I could barely lock it behind me.\n\n‘We don’t allow pets anymore,’ the owner had written in the confirmation email, ‘the coyotes have  been a bit braver recently.’\n\nAt the time I’d thought nothing of it, I wasn’t bringing an animal after all, but now as I watched the  pack circle the house I wondered how long the eyes I’d felt in the darkness belonged to them.  There’s no boundary here, I realised, between the wild and me.  And as the last hints of sunlight over the mountains faded to purple and black, the coyotes lifted  their heads and howled.\n\nI retreated to the bedroom, pulling the curtains tight. With my family and friends an ocean away I  reached out to the only person I knew how to contact; the rental owner. I could message them  through the booking app, and perhaps, if I was lucky, they’d be nearby.\n\n‘There are coyotes here, they’re all around the house. What should I do?’ I typed. I felt so stupid almost the moment it sent.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nWhat should I do?!\n\nCalm down. Take a breath.  They’re basically dogs, and now I’m inside, I told myself. I gulped down air until I didn’t feel like my  heart was climbing my throat. Just a stupid overreaction to a situation that wasn’t even a big deal.  So what if there are coyotes in the desert? Where the hell else would they be?\n\nBut I couldn’t fight the seed of fear planted in my belly. There was no way, I thought, that I would  sleep here tonight. My best bet would be to pack an overnight bag, jump in my rental and grab a  room at a motel back in town.\n\nSo I grabbed a few things and stuffed them in a backpack. I would run out to the car and jump  straight in. It wasn’t far from the front door. Just a few steps. Easy.\n\nI ducked past dark windows, feeling like an idiot, and stopped at the door. My hand paused over the  handle… just one check of the spy hole. That was a normal thing to do.\n\nI leaned in, taking a second to adjust to the darkness beyond. The moonlight was just bright enough  to make out the car. All clear. I sighed. Hell the coyotes were probably—\n\nSomething moved... just at the edge of the brush, almost out of sight of the peephole.\n\nFor a second I thought it was a man, before I realised the legs and head were all wrong. A coyote, but stood on its back legs as it  walked up to the door in a strange, broken stagger.\n\nI felt the hair on the back of my neck rise and stumbled away.  The phone in my pocket chimed. I fumbled for it and saw a reply from the owner.\n\n‘Check the windows.’\n\nCheck the windows? Why would I—but through the kitchen I saw it. Saw those same eyes staring inside. Distorted paws picking at the unlocked screen… and God help me, I ran.\n\nNow I’m here, locked in a tiny, windowless bathroom. My back against the door, my fingers  cramped from holding the lock shut. I don’t know when it’ll be dawn, but I hear them breathing in the darkness. The click of claws on tiled floors. The police won't come. I can't get out, and I don't know what to do.",

        "text": "“It sounds like rocks are stuffed down its throat.”\n\n“So the voice has a gravelly, baritone quality?” \n\n“Like a smoker. Or someone who screams a helluva lot.” \n\n“Does it ever raise its voice at you?” \n\n“Sometimes.” \n\n“Is it getting loud right now?” \n\n“...I’m used to it.” \n\n“Would you feel comfortable sharing what it’s saying to you?”\n\n“Do you really wanna know?”\n\n“It’s my job to know.” \n\n“All right. He says you can’t be trusted. And that you suck dick.” \n\n“Well, wrong on both accounts.” \n\n“That’s not how I feel. He’s separate from me. It’s hard to explain.”\n\n“I understand. The voice in your head is not you. Have you ever told him that?” \n\n“I can’t talk back to him.” \n\n“What would happen if you tried?”\n\n“He’s focused on everybody else right now, I don’t want him turning on me.”\n\n“Does he have a name?” \n\n“I call him Mister X. He’s got x-ray vision. He sees everything.” \n\n“Do you want Mister X to leave you alone?”\n\n“He doesn’t want to leave.” \n\n“Would your life be better without him in it?”\n\n“Of course it would. But it’s not like I can- I can’t just fucking tell him to stop.” \n\n“I can tell that upsets you.” \n\n“Sorry. I don’t usually- I usually try and keep all this in.” \n\n“You’re incredibly resilient, Jane. But this doesn’t need to be your life anymore. You have a shitty roommate living with you. He’s taken over your house and is making a mess of it. With your permission, I'd like to work together to give Mister X a face and a body so that you can finally look him in the eye and tell him there is no longer a place for him inside of you. How does that sound?” \n\n“...Like a dream.” \n\nJane had been suffering from auditory hallucinations since her early twenties. A working professional, Jane had managed to suppress the voice for years. Lately though, it had turned increasingly hostile. She had been recommended to me by her therapist because the voice, Mister X, was now telling her that a partner at her law firm was conspiring to kill her, and advised that she violently intervene before it was too late. \n\nJane is not her real name. All of the names have been changed for patient confidentiality. \n\nI’m a psychiatric nurse at a catholic hospital. I work exclusively with psychotic patients. What makes me different from your average mental health professional is that instead of using CBT or pharmaceuticals to treat psychosis, I use avatar therapy.\n\nI brought Jane over to a computer terminal that I’d set up in a vacant operating room. I tried to disguise its former use through floral wallpaper and light-toned furniture. But the wide, spacious feel of the room and its monolithic, splatter-proof floor made its history known. \n\nWe sat together at the terminal and I helped her use a graphics program to generate a 3D rendering of Mister X. The software itself is pretty basic, nothing high-tech. The graphics are laughable. But that’s kind of the point.\n\nWe gave Mister X a long face. Narrow eyes with deep bags. Bulbous ears. A wide scowl. Exaggerated, cartoonish features. As his face took shape, she told me he actually looked a little like her uncle. Which was not uncommon. Often the tormenting starts in the home.    \n\nOnce we had a face for the voice, I then worked with Jane to figure out exactly what he sounded like in her head. I spoke into a microphone and adjusted the vocal qualities until the voice coming out of the computer speaker sounded to her like Mister X.\n\n“How are you feeling?” \n\nI was now in a narrow janitor’s closet converted into a work space. Jane was alone in the adjacent therapy room. She couldn’t see me but I was watching her through a live video feed on my laptop screen. \n\n“It still sounds like you.” \n\n“We haven’t started yet. Are you ready?” \n\n“I don’t know… *Fuck*. Okay, yeah. I’m ready.”\n\n“If it ever gets to be too much-”\n\n“I push this button.” \n\n“That’s right. Okay. From now on, I’ll be talking to you as Mister X.” \n\nJane didn’t respond. I opened a small notebook. It was full of common phrases that Mister X told her over the years. I adjusted my headset with the microphone. Clicked the button to change my vocal qualities. Engaged the avatar. And then I became Mister X. \n\n“*Janey. Listen to me. You’re in danger.”*\n\nJane leaned back from the computer. The avatar on her screen was now moving and talking to her. A long faced man with a gravelly voice. This often took some getting used to. \n\n“Oh my god. That sounds just like him.” \n\n*“Janey. Listen to me. You’re in danger.”*\n\nIt was better if I stayed in character until she felt comfortable responding on her own. The more she believed this was real, the better equipped she would be to face an actual hallucination. \n\n“Okay, shit. This is weird. Just give me a second to…”\n\nShe composed herself for a moment. Took a deep breath. Then looked right at the screen. \n\n“I’m not in danger.” \n\n“*That’s what they want you to think. They want you to let your guard down. They wanna make you weak.*” \n\n“I’m not weak.” \n\n“*C’mon Janey. These cocksuckers, they’re softening you up. They wanna hurt you.”*\n\n“That’s not true.” \n\n“*No? What about Theresa? That bitch is after you.*” \n\n“I’ve known Theresa for years. She’s not a threat. I’m okay.” \n\n*“You’re not okay, Janey. Don’t let ‘em fool you. If you let your guard down, these cocksuckers-*”\n\n“I said I’m okay. I don’t need you in my life anymore.” \n\n*“You’re worthless on your own. Pathetic. You know you need me*.” \n\n“Suck my dick!” \n\nI smiled. That was the first step of Jane taking control back from her tormentor. \n\nOver the course of our session, Mister X would become less hostile, and eventually concede power to her. That was the method. And it worked. Time and again, my patients reported a remarkable drop in the frequency of visual and auditory hallucinations after our sessions. \n\nMy results were so irrefutable that I started to build a bit of a name for myself. An odd little niche within the field of abnormal psychology. Was it any wonder I lived alone? \n\nJane had just left my office feeling euphoric, and I was riding that high, too. I’m deeply empathetic by nature, so when my patients arrive at a breakthrough- it’s better than sex. \n\nI sat down at my desk with a celebratory Lean Cuisine. No time for a break, not with as many clients as the hospital had thrown on me. There had been a steady uptick of patients since the pandemic. Maybe our bodies were developing immunity, but our minds still festered. \n\nSomething about the smell of microwaved ravioli stirred up some personal memories. I glanced at a faded picture on my desk. It was of me and my daughter when she was five. This was before all the trouble began. A moment of clarity and comfort. I missed that time greatly. \n\n*Ring-ring-ring*.\n\nI answered my work line while trying to swallow down a piping hot ravioli. \n\n“...Hello? Is someone there?” \n\n“Saint Mary’s Psychiatrics, Nora speaking?” \n\n“Nora, hi. My name is Father Edward Beckett. You don’t know me but I’ve been following your work closely for quite some time.”\n\n“Oh. Okay?” \n\n“I imagine you don’t get many calls from priests.” \n\n“You are the first. What can I do for you, Father?” \n\n“Well, as I said, I’ve been really impressed with what you’ve been able to accomplish through your unique approach to therapy. I think what you’ve done for your patients is extraordinary.” \n\n“I appreciate you saying that.” \n\nThere was a pause. I waited for him to tell me the real reason he was calling. And he was probably working up the courage to be straight with me. \n\n“Is there anything else, Father?”\n\n“I have someone I’d like to refer to you. A member of my congregation.” \n\n“My patients are typically referred through their physicians or therapists. And to be honest, I’m pretty much maxed out at the moment.” \n\n“Of course, I understand. I’m wondering if you might be willing to make an exception though. For someone in desperate need of help beyond my abilities.”\n\n“...Beyond your abilities?” \n\n“He’s a good man, Nora. But he’s losing himself. There is a dark and sinister force inside of him that is tearing his life apart.” \n\n“Have you provided him with counseling?” \n\n“I’m reaching out to you because I have tried the methods of the church and they have failed. My hope is that yours might be more effective in this particular case.” \n\nI set down my fork. Pushed the tray aside. Did I just hear that correctly? \n\n“I am a man of faith and science. I am not afraid to seek out experts such as yourself who may be able to help in matters that exceed my capabilities as a priest. I believe the work that you are doing is miraculous, Nora. And that God lives in that work just as much as anything else.”\n\nMy eyes flicked back to the photo on my desk. I looked at the younger version of myself. A woman about to descend into a deep mad darkness. Who needed the help I now provided. \n\n“...If you think this man is willing to seek treatment outside the church, I can deliver it.” \n\n“Thank you, Nora. I will speak to Michael. He’s a good man. You will see.” \n\nMichael worked as a firefighter. He had a wife and three children. He was devoted to his family, and a beloved figure in the community. The kind of guy who would give you the shirt off his back. Or at least that’s how he was described to me by Father Edward. \n\nIn person, I found him to be self-conscious and fidgety. His leg bounced the entirety of our conversation. His eyes roamed the bare walls of the evaluation room as if searching for a way out. His focus came in waves of hyper-intensity and then immense distance. He seemed uncomfortable in his skin. And deeply distrusting of me and the support I was offering him.  \n\n“And your wife-”\n\n“Michelle, yeah.” \n\n“Has Michelle noticed any change in your behavior?”\n\n“She says I should be sleeping more.”\n\n“You’re having trouble sleeping?” \n\n“I’m just awake more. Got a lot on my mind these days. Who doesn’t, you know.” \n\n“Have you noticed any recurring thoughts that might be making it difficult to sleep?” \n\nMichael bit at the end of his thumb. A compulsive habit accentuated when he was stressed.\n\n“...Not really, no.” \n\n“Is Michelle expressing any concerns about-” \n\n“I don’t wanna talk about my wife.”\n\n“Okay. Let’s pause for a minute.”\n\nI set my notebook aside. Sat forward in my chair. My voice was warm but assertive. \n\n“Michael, I want you to know that it is not my intention to keep you from your family. In fact, my goal is actually to keep you out of a psychiatric hospital like the one we’re in right now.”\n\n“Oh yeah?” \n\n“Yeah. I know you’re just getting to know me, but I’m a very straight-up person. I won’t make promises I can’t keep. And I won’t ever lie to you.” \n\nHe looked away. His face twitched. He was hearing or seeing something, or both. \n\n“So you, uh, *fix people*, huh?” \n\n“Actually, I don’t look at it that way. I’m not trying to fix my patients. I don’t think you or anyone else I see is broken. I think there might be parts of you that are causing a disturbance in your life. And those are the parts that I’d like to work with you to regain control over.” \n\n“You don’t think I’m broken?” \n\n“I have a lot of respect for the people I see. I greatly admire their tenacity and resilience. It’s not easy to navigate a world that you see differently from those around you.” \n\n“I’ve done awful things to people I love.”\n\n“Are you referring to your wife?” \n\n“And my kids. Terrible things…”\n\n“Why do you think you’ve done those things to them?” \n\n“It’s overpowering sometimes…” \n\n“You feel like you aren’t in control of your actions?”\n\n“No, I take full responsibility. It’s on me, even when it isn’t exactly me.” \n\n“Have you noticed you’ve been using the word *it* a lot in our conversation? Maybe you can help me understand exactly what *it* means to you.” \n\nMichael looked down at his thumb. And started to bite it again. I noticed then that his knuckles looked raw and bruised. As if he’d been hitting them against a wall. \n\n“Michael, some of my patients, they hear voices. Someone calling their name in their bedroom, mumbling in the dark, telling them to do things. Have you ever experienced anything like that?” \n\n“I don’t know. Maybe. At times.” \n\n“Are they generally positive things you’re hearing, or negative?” \n\n“Negative.” \n\n“That’s tough. How long have you been hearing these voices?”\n\n“It’s one voice. For several months now.” \n\n“Is it only the voice you’re hearing, or do you see something as well?” \n\n“The voice comes from its mouth. And the mouth is attached to its face. Like how people talk.”\n\n“Okay.” \n\nI was silent for a moment while he looked at the wall behind me and blinked. His face squinted as if staring into a bright light. I waited until he was ready to continue. \n\n“...If I’m not broken, how’d it get inside me?” \n\n“Can you be a little more specific?” \n\n“The devil- how’d the devil get in me.” \n\n“That’s helpful. Thank you, Michael. So you’ve been seeing the devil for several months now?” \n\nThe plain manner of my speech seemed to throw him. But religious figures are extremely common in psychosis so I was unphased by his admission. I kept the ball rolling.\n\n“Do you remember the first time it appeared or spoke to you? And you should know that nothing that you say will shock or disturb me in any way.” \n\n“I remember...”\n\n“Take your time.”\n\n“...We got a call to this apartment building not far from here. Somebody left a burner on, a dishrag caught fire. By the time we got there, flames were erupting from the middle of the structure, working up to higher floors. Some of the guys stayed on the outside to man the hose while I went in to extract the residents. I was clearing the floor when I heard someone calling for me at the end of a hallway. I broke down a couple doors but couldn’t figure out where it was coming from. At some point, I realized I’d looked in every room on the entire floor. And they were all empty. And still, this voice was somewhere, calling for me…”\n\n“Do you want to take a break? Some water?”\n\nMichael didn’t answer. He was pale and sweaty. He sucked at the trickle of blood that came out the end of his thumb. I waited in the silence until he was ready to share his deepest shame. \n\n“I finally found it. At the end of the hallway, like it’d been there the whole time. A man on fire. His skin was melting off. Eyes big and white, like eggs on a frying pan. He had flames all over him but he was standing up completely straight. And he was talking. Calling out to me. Not for help. He was trying to tell me something…”\n\n“Were you able to hear what he said?”\n\n“He was saying, it’s all gonna burn. Everything in my life. It was all gonna burn...” \n\n“Okay. It’s alright. Take a moment to-” \n\n“And while I was standing there like a dumbass, several of the residents on the floor above me were burning alive. Five people- four adults, one child. They died cause I- cause I was listening to this goddamn thing that doesn’t make any sense… So how you feeling ‘bout me now, doc?” \n\nI felt his pain. His guilt. And fear. His desire to have the sting of these searing memories taken from him. I related to all of it. So when I responded to him, I spoke from the heart. \n\n“That is a painful experience. I appreciate you sharing it with me. To answer your question, I think you’ve had to endure a lot of confusion and despair, but I don’t think you’re broken.”\n\n“You don’t know the half of it, lady.” \n\n“Would you be comfortable sharing more?”\n\nMichael laughed despite himself. Surprised by my willingness to go wherever the conversation led, no matter how dark or troubling. I smiled back at him, encouraging him to continue. \n\n“It followed me home.”\n\n“This devil, this man on fire?” \n\n“Every time I’d close my eyes, it’d call out to me. I tried to ignore it. But the more I did, the louder it got. And the more aggressive. Threatening my wife, my kids. It knew exactly what to say to keep my attention. So I started listening. And Michelle, she’d find me in the middle of the night in strange places, sometimes stark naked, raving mad, just listening to the dark.” \n\n“You said it was telling you to do things?” \n\n“Yeah, bizarre shit. Like it wanted me to tear down this chicken coop we had in the backyard. Use the wood to make some kinda altar. I don’t know. I never finished it. Michelle wanted me to see Father Eddie after she caught me taking a sledgehammer to the coop.”\n\n“And you received counseling from your priest?” \n\n“Counseling? No, I wouldn’t call it that.” \n\n“I can’t legally ask you specifics about your religious experiences unless you open that door.”\n\n“You can ask me if I hear voices, but not about church?” \n\n“I know.” \n\n“And I’m the one who’s crazy.” \n\n“I know.” \n\n“All right. Well, Michelle was on me to talk to Father Eddie. She was so afraid cause- well, what really happened that night, she tried to stop me from taking down that chicken coop, and I turned the sledgehammer on her. I was ready to kill her- for what?” \n\n“Did you strike her?” \n\n“...I missed.” \n\n“Okay. And you told this all to Father Edward?”\n\n“He thought it might be demonic, whatever had taken control of me. That didn’t make a lotta sense cause I’d been baptized and taken the sacrament since I was a kid. But he brought in another priest anyway, and both of them, they tried to, uh…”\n\n“An exorcism?” \n\n“I don’t remember much of it. Just waking up and realizing they were holding me down. Terrified of me. There was a utility knife in my hand that I carry around. Not today, don’t worry. They said I was threatening them. And threatening myself.” \n\nI knew most of this already from Father Edward. But it was important for Michael to trust me enough to share this all with me directly. This is one of the things that makes me good at my job. I can lead anyone to water. \n\n“Let’s end there for the day. But first, I want to acknowledge your strength in coming here and sharing some incredibly personal things with me. I won’t promise anything, but I may be able to help you, Michael.” \n\n“...Call me, Mike.” \n\nOn my way home, I called my daughter. She didn’t answer. I texted her while at a red light. I told her I was thinking about her and hoped she was doing well. She didn’t respond. I scrolled up on the screen and realized she hadn’t responded in months. My job, as demanding as it was, made the passage of time less agonizing. I was grateful on some level for the way it consumed me. \n\nLater that night, I fell asleep thinking of my conversation with Michael, and how I would approach the next phase. Maybe that’s why I woke up before dawn, hearing the softest voice speaking indiscriminately from the dark corner of my room. \n\n“You said its face looks burnt?”\n\n“Burning. Its skin drips off in clumps. There’s fire ripping over it.” \n\n“Okay. Honestly, this program isn’t the greatest, but let’s see what we can do.” \n\nWe were in the therapy room. Its cozy aesthetic did seem to put Michael at ease as we got to work building a simulation of the devil in his head.\n\nI enlarged the avatar’s face across the screen. Stretched its forehead wide and gave it a crooked chin. I left its mouth wide open, as if its jaw were unhinged. No teeth, only a gaping dark circle. I made its eyes large and opaque. Skin gray. A dim glow around its entire frame. \n\n“That’s not really what it looks like.” \n\n“No? The devil doesn’t look like a holy marshmallow man?” \n\nMichael laughed. \n\n“There’s a bit of imagination involved in this. It’s kind of silly at first. How about its voice? What does it sound like to you?” \n\n“Like a shovel against stone.” \n\n“So pretty intense, grating?” \n\n“It fills your head.” \n\nI adjusted the vocal range. And tried it out on him, speaking into the microphone. \n\n“*HOW’S THIS?”* \n\nMichael jumped back. Then laughed a little, embarrassed. \n\n“That uh- actually, yeah, sounds kinda like it.” \n\nWe were ready. I moved into the adjacent room with the reminder that he could end the session at any point by pressing the button on his desk. \n\nI opened my laptop. There was a live feed from a camera behind Michael, looking over his shoulder. And one in front of him. I could toggle between the two angles. I also had a window open that showed what the avatar was doing while I spoke through it. I adjusted my headset, and started to talk to him in my voice. \n\n“How are you feeling?” \n\n“Ridiculous. Like you said.” \n\n“Take it as seriously as you’re comfortable.”\n\n“I’m just supposed to talk to the face on the screen?” \n\n“This is your chance to put your tormentor in its place. Don’t hold back.” \n\n“Oh, I’ve got some words.” \n\n“Good. Ready?” \n\n“Why not.” \n\nI switched the vocal range on my microphone. Engaged the avatar. Looked over my notes of choice phrases. Until the end of our session, I was now the devil.\n\n“*YOU’VE BEEN IGNORING ME, MICHAEL.”* \n\nMichael didn’t respond. I switched to the front angle. He was biting his thumb. So I tried again. \n\n“*DON’T IGNORE ME.”* \n\nNo response.\n\n“*SPEAK TO ME.”* \n\nThe avatar was moving, my voice coming through. I was reading the script we agreed on. And still, no reaction from Michael whatsoever. \n\nSomething was off. I dropped the filter and spoke to him in my own voice. \n\n“Are you hearing me okay-”\n\n“Shut the hell up.” \n\nI toggled between cameras. His face was twisted. I could see he was in distress. \n\n“Do you want this to end, Micahel? Just press the button if-” \n\n“You don’t get to tell me what to do anymore.” \n\nI leaned closer to the monitor. I noticed his eyes weren’t on the screen. He was staring off at the corner of the room. I switched angles. The room was of course empty. \n\n“I’m taking my life back. You understand that, asshole?”\n\nHe was speaking to something, but not to me. My patients did occasionally experience their own auditory or visual hallucinations during a session, so this wasn’t altogether strange.  \n\nBut what I couldn’t immediately explain, the dark streaks that seemed to have materialized on the wall across from Michael, the one that connected our rooms. I stared closely at the live feed. The streaks looked like burn marks. \n\nUnsettled, I watched in silence as Michael continued his rebuke.\n\n“You think you’re stronger than me? You’re nothing but a fuckin’ leach. Go back to hell, you little piece of shit. And leave me and my family the fuck alone-” \n\nMichael’s head suddenly fell to his chest. His shoulders slumped. His eyes were open but his face was lifeless. Drool spilled out of his mouth onto his shirt. He looked catatonic. \n\nI leapt from my chair. About to swing the door open and call for help when-\n\nMichael sat straight up and stared right into the camera. His chin glistened from the drool that continued to spill out of his mouth. \n\nI hovered above the laptop screen, transfixed. \n\nAn alarm suddenly flashed across my laptop. I quickly toggled to the other camera where I could see that his thumb was pressing the kill-switch, over and over. \n\n“Okay, Michael, we’re done. I’m coming-” \n\nHis head spun around to face me. Somehow he knew which camera angle I was on. When he spoke, his voice had taken on a different quality. Like a shovel against stone. \n\n*“NORA.”*\n\nI froze. Not only because Michael’s voice changed, but also, the avatar on my screen, the simulated devil we had made together, was tilting its head to look up at me. \n\nWhen Michael spoke, the mouth of the avatar also moved. \n\n*“THEY’RE BURNING, NORA. CAN YOU HEAR THEM SCREAM?”* \n\nI took a step back from the screen. Psychosis can at times be infectious. You can catch it like a cold. An emotional contagion. I knew this was possible- was it happening to me now? \n\n*“YOUR DAUGHTER IS BURNING. YOU MADE THIS FIRE. THIS IS YOUR FAULT.”* \n\nI didn’t tell him I had a daughter. \n\nMy eyes left the monitor for a moment. There was a dark streak in the corner, spreading across the wall that connected our rooms. I could feel the temperature rising in the room.\n\nWhen I looked back at the screen, Michael had somehow caught fire. Bright flames engulfed his entire body, but he did nothing to put them out. He just stayed there, looking at me, burning. \n\nI removed my headset. Threw it on the desk. Turned for the door.\n\nGo to your desk. Call a Code Gray. Activate the nurses and guards. Find an extinguisher. Administer antipsychotics orally, or an injection if he doesn’t comply. You can do this. \n\nI tried to open the door. It was locked from the outside. I shook the handle hard. Still locked.\n\n*YOU’RE IGNORING ME, NORA.* \n\nThe voice sounded different, closer. I slowly turned around. My laptop was gone. In its place, the computer terminal where Michael had been sitting. Somehow, I was in the therapy room. The avatar now looking at me from the computer screen, speaking to me directly. \n\n*DON’T IGNORE ME.* \n\nI let out a shaky breath. Tried to control my heart rate. My hand instinctively pressed against the wall for balance. It was hot to the touch. Scalding, in fact. \n\n*SPEAK TO ME.*\n\n“I don’t know what’s happening. If anyone can hear me, please get help.” \n\nThe avatar stared back without a response. The flowers on the wallpaper wilted from the heat.  \n\n“Michael? Can you hear me? Please find a nurse or security, anyone to-”\n\nThe face of the avatar suddenly took on a different form. A face I recognized. Even through the poor graphics, I could tell immediately it was meant to resemble my daughter.\n\n*MOM? MOM IS THAT YOU?*\n\nI stood there for a long moment. The avatar of my daughter called out to me. \n\n*IT’S HOT IN HERE. I CAN’T- I CAN’T BREATHE. WHY DID YOU PUT ME HERE?!* \n\nI shut my eyes, certain I was now in the grip of a psychotic break. I tried a grounded method I used on my patients- inhale for a count of four, hold it for four, exhale for four, and repeat.  \n\nOne. Two. Three. Four. One. Two- \n\nI could hear my daughter’s distorted screams. She was crying out in pain. \n\n*LET ME OUT LET ME OUT LET ME OUT!* \n\nI knew this couldn’t be real, but it sounded so much like her. I opened my eyes for a brief moment. The avatar was on fire- entire computer erupting into flames. I shut them tight. \n\nI had to slow down my nervous system. I was about to try another grounding exercise when- all the screaming and heat from the fire was suddenly vacuumed from the room. I felt an incredible pressure in my chest, as if struck by a giant fist. And then everything was silent and still. \n\nMy eyes drifted open. The burn marks were gone. The computer intact. The avatar on the screen stared at me, motionless. \n\nI tried once again to call for help. \n\n*“...HELLO? CAN ANYONE HEAR ME?”* \n\nMy voice was not my own. \n\nMy hands instinctively wandered up towards my face. I felt a pointed chin that wobbled in my hand, unhinged from its jaw. A gaping mouth. Engorged eyes. My skin hot and wet, like melted wax. The face of the devil. *My face*. \n\nI staggered back, fell to the floor. I dug my fingernails into my flesh, trying to scratch it off. \n\n“Nora…”\n\nA voice, someone calling to me- someone grabbing hold of me. I fought back. I needed to get that fucking face off me… \n\n“Stop- Nora! Hey, *hey*, come back to your body. You’re all right. You’re okay.”  \n\nMy eyes fluttered open. I was looking up at a nurse from the hospital. A friend, John. He was breathless, a panicked look.  \n\n“We gave you a shot of haloperidol. You should be feeling that now.” \n\nI glanced around. I was in the therapy room, I hadn’t imagined that part. There were several nurses and security guards hovering over me.  \n\n“...What happened?” \n\n“I’m not sure. Michael called for help. You got your own Code Gray. How ‘bout that?” \n\nI looked over and found Michael in a corner of the room, speaking to another nurse. He glanced over at me, clear-eyed. He held up a hand as a kind of wave, a recognition.  \n\n“I feel strange...” \n\n“I bet. You got a shit ton of antipsychotics in your system.” \n\n“No, there’s something wrong- *oh god*…”\n\nI sat up and threw up all over the floor. John patted my back until it was all out. \n\n“Just the drugs, just the drugs.” \n\nI wasn’t so sure. I called my daughter after I was medically cleared to leave- my face covered in bandages. She didn’t answer. So I called again. And again, until-\n\n“What do you want?” \n\n“Taylor….” \n\n“I’m at work. Why did you just call me six times?” \n\n“Sorry, something happened and I- I just needed to hear your voice.” \n\n“Oh-kay. Well I’m gonna hang up now.” \n\n“Wait, can we just- how are you?” \n\nA long silence. And then click. She hung up on me. \n\nThe hospital put me on a two-week leave. I was to be assessed by a psychiatric nurse before seeing patients again. But I had a feeling they’d bring me back no matter what. The psychotic patients would keep coming in like a leaky tap. Who else would be willing to help them. \n\nI could still log into my computer remotely, and had access to my voicemail. Father Edward left me a message. He said that Michael had improved dramatically since our last session. His family and congregation extended their gratitude to me. Father Edward also said he heard that I was now unwell. He offered his thoughts and prayers. And counseling, if I thought that might help in any way. Sometimes even saints need healing, he assured me. \n\nIt’s been a week since these events. I’m alone now, in my house. I haven’t left for days. Haven’t even removed the crusted bandages from my face. Texts and calls keep coming in from friends and colleagues. But I’m having some trouble looking away from my computer screen. \n\nI’ve been talking to the avatar. It’s telling me I have work to do. It’s asking me to tear apart my walls and use the wood to build an altar. The more I ignore it, the more severe the threats.\n\nThis is psychotic behavior. I know, I know, I know. But it’s all starting to make sense to me.",

        "text": "When I was a kid, I was in second grade, I believe. We had a science proffessor that made us do a project.\n\nNow before I begins telling the story, I have to tell you that in my country, parents aren't as attentive as are others in other countries. Most of us didn't get help from anyone since our parents always said that it would be better for us to figure it out by ourselves.\n\nSo, we had a new teacher at school, I don't remember his face or name anymore, but that man made the whole class do a project.\n\nThe project was called the Humunculos Project, we were super excited to make a miniatures of ourselves, we were kids. So, the teacher gave us something, I think it was blood or something, the liquid was red. He told us to inject it into an egg and watch the proccess for the next week.\n\nWe did so, me and some of my friends did it together, we had four eggs together and we all injected whatever were given to us. The eggs were to be recently laid.\n\nThe first day nothing happened, really. The second day was something sort of veins spread on the eggs, the third day, the eggs were turning black. We were really excited to see the process, we just thought the process was okay.\n\nWe told the teacher and he just smiled and nodded saying \"Good Job\" again, we were happy that the project was going well since that meant we would get good points and extra credits.\n\nHowever, on the fourth day cracks appeared on the shells, we put the eggs in a containers as to not let whatever was i side fall on the ground.\n\nWhen we went to check the eggs on the fifth day, the eggs had already hatched, but... there was nothing inside.\n\nThere were two small black feathers in the spot though, I was disappointed that I couldn't see what had hatched. The Next day we went to the teacher and told him about what happened, he just laughed and rubbed our head and said if he could have those two frathers, we gave him the feathers because he said he would give us extra credit so we did.\n\nThe teacher never came back on Monday though, he had apparently quit and moved away, at the time it wasn't really a big deal, but now that I think back, I wonder. What the heck we even hatched, needless to say. Me and my friends did happened to see something crawl into the tall grass near our homes.\n\nIt was black in color, crawling on fours. We were spooked because it was dark out, we didn't have much to do but talk among us and just tell eachother day events.\n\nWe got curious despite being scared, and went to look, we just heard small low screeches of a bird or something, we thought it was a snake because sometimes snakes call out to chicks in the dark, making the sound of the chicken when calling their little chicks.\n\nWhen we arrived where the sound came from, there was only one large black feather left behind. We left the feather where it was, we weren't going to pick it up because why would we? We were kids and just thought it was a normal feather and perhaps it was, but now that I think about it. The experiment, the four legged chicken?, the sound, little feathers and then a large black feather? It might have been just something normal but one thing is for certain.\n\nThat teacher made us create something that perhaps was what he was looking for, he never shouwed to schoom again, never heard of him. We asked out principal what had happened and he just told not to worry about him.\n\nHonestly, this story might not be that spooky, but it is scary to think that we as kids, made somthing that we can not explain, something is out there. At night there are screams of something or someone deep in the forest, black feathers.\n\nI wonder what thlse black feathers mean🤔",

        "author": "SignedSyledDelivered",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11qeldn/exposure_therapy/",
        "text": " “It’s been 5 minutes since we’ve been talking about and making fun of the demon! How anxious are you feeling, now, from 0 to 10?” I asked, pen hovered above the page, ready to mark down her anxiety level at the 5-minute mark. \n\n“3,” she said, fidgeting in her seat. \n\n“I see! Wow, it was a 7 at the start, what helped it drop so quickly to a 3?” I asked, a little surprised. Exposure therapy usually took longer than that. \n\n“We don’t have any red containers in here. The demon hides only in red containers.”\n\nThere it was. The detail I missed. The little girl had been terrified of even speaking about the demon, so we had not managed to discuss it enough to know these important elements, not until this session. \n\n“I see,” I said, furrowing my brows. Then an idea popped up, and I smiled. \n\n“The other room is available right now, and there’s a large red container used to hold toys. Do you think the demon could hide in something like that?”\n\nThe little girl’s face fell. I felt bad for her, but knew that this was necessary. \n\nShe nodded solemnly, biting her lower lip. \n\n“Are you willing to try this at the other room? But don’t worry,” I said, seeing her face turn pale, “we will just talk about it for 5 minutes! That’s all we need to start with. Just two minutes, and you can pray or leave the room or think good thoughts to chase the thought of the demon away after.”\n\nUsually, I would ensure that for any exposure activity I conducted with clients, clients would have their reported anxiety levels lowered to 0 on the scale, before ending the exposure. But for this little girl, she was not ready to do that yet. Just talking about the demon in her imagination while assessing her obsessive and compulsive symptoms had made her tear up.\n\nShe firmly believed that there was an invisible demon following her, which could make itself seen at times. Every time she thought about the demon, she would have to pray three times, and think of a series of good thoughts to “chase the bad thought away”. Her anxiety about this demon had steadily increased over the months, and finally, her parents sent her for therapy. \n\nI had been explaining what Obsessive Compulsive Disorder was to her for the past sessions, and prepping her for the Exposure and Response-Prevention sessions that we would be doing. We had her list of anxiety-triggering situations and the actions she would feel compelled to do to ease her anxiety, ranked in order from those that provoked the least anxiety to the highest.\n\nToday was our first ever exposure session. I was surprised that she was even willing to try to talk about the demon for 5 minutes straight for her first ever exposure activity.\n\nShe hesitated, and I said, “How about just for 2 minutes? And we don’t have to make fun of it, we can just talk about it, help me understand what it’s like more. How’s that?” I smiled as encouragingly as possible. \n\nShe slowly nodded, and grabbed her bag. I praised her profusely for her bravery and courage, then we made our way to the other room in the clinic. \n\nShe stared nervously at the red container when we entered, and after we settled down. \n\n“So, shall we start?” I asked gently.\n\n“Okay.”\n\n“You brave girl! All right, how anxious are you feeling right now?”\n\n“8,” she said, her eyes glued to the red container. \n\nI noted it down, and asked “How does this demon look like?”\n\nBefore she could respond, the lights in the room began to flicker. \n\nI saw the fear mount in her eyes, and jumped to reassure her. \n\n“This light has been flickering for the past week! It’s an old bulb. We really should’ve gotten it changed earlier, I’ll let the manager know to please get it done soon.”\n\nThis was complete nonsense, I had no idea that the lights were faulty until that moment. But there was no way in hell that I’d let my client have her beliefs in this demon cemented. It would make future exposure sessions for her that much more difficult, and her symptoms would probably worsen. \n\n“Do you know that old bulbs no longer allow the electricity to circulate smoothly? So the lights flicker, like this.” I saw her face relax a little as I said this. \n\n“Are you ready to continue?” I asked. She nodded. \n\nWe proceeded to discuss how the demon looked like. It had no face. It was a man. He was apparently a deep burgundy red, or, as the girl described, “dark red, like the colour of mummy’s wine”. \n\nHe had appeared in her mind around 4 months ago, but she had never seen him in person, in real life. But she knew he was waiting to be able to spring out at her, a scythe in hand, to slice her to pieces. She couldn’t think about him for too long, or he would appear. \n\nHe didn’t eat, didn’t sleep, and could leave the house by teleporting. He had skinny legs and couldn’t run fast, so she was often able to get away in time when she felt he was about to appear. \n\nAs we spoke about this demon, I asked for her anxiety levels at regular intervals. Her anxiety shot up due to the flickering lights, but slowly went down over time. \n\n“Hey, you realise something?” I asked, smiling widely, staring at her with a glint in my eye.\n\n“What?” She asked, eyes wide.\n\n“You’ve been talking about him for 10 minutes already!” I announced proudly.\n\nHer jaw dropped. “Oh wow!”\n\n“Right? This is so impressive. You agreed to 5 minutes, but how time has gone by! And, he is nowhere to be seen!” \n\nShe broke into a huge smile, and seemed mighty proud of herself. As she should be. I praised her courage, and she announced that she wanted to continue with the exposure session. \n\n35 minutes later, her anxiety was at a 1. There was no way for it to get to 0, she had explained, as she believed that a reason why the demon didn’t appear was because I was there with her. I tried to explain to her that that was how Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) worked – it tried to give reasons and excuses to discount any experiences that the person might have, so that it could survive longer in the person. OCD would make up stories about why exposure therapy went well, to make the person doubt themselves. But I also knew that she would probably have to go through an exposure session alone for her to truly believe that. \n\nBut I was hopeful. She announced that the flickering lights were just annoying to her now, not scary, and before she left, she said, “Maybe the demon really doesn’t exist.”\n\nAs I packed my stuff and prepared to leave the room, the lights continued to flicker. I shot a quick text to the clinic manager about replacing the bulb, then went to make sure everything in the clinic was in order before I left. No one else was around as I was the only psychologist willing to work past normal working hours on a Friday. \n\nI felt a chill run down my spine as I shut off the lights. I laughed nervously to myself. Those damn lights and all that talk about demons really did freak me out a little. I shook my head. I needed to work on erasing the last traces of my superstitious beliefs to be a better psych. \n\nWith that thought, I decided to settle down on a chair in the room with the red container, in the dark. I wanted to leave, I wanted to get home, but I needed to do some exposure therapy on myself. I used to have OCD, to be honest, and I had crazy magical beliefs and fears, and once in a while, these days, I still had to catch myself and practice exposure whenever I was tempted to perform my compulsions, to get back to a healthier baseline. \n\nI felt beads of cold sweat prick my forehead. I was a little surprised by the tension in my body. I pretty much have any traces of obsessions and compulsions under control, so I didn’t expect that level of anxiety to occur from sitting in the clinic in the dark. \n\nBut something felt incredibly off. My stomach was twisting itself into a knot, my body recoiling at the terrifying sense that something was really wrong. That something awful was about to happen. \n\nDetermined to walk the talk, I grabbed the armrests and planted my feet firmly on the ground to stop my body from fleeing the clinic. \n\n*Focus on the anxiety*, I thought to myself. *Where is it in my body? How does it feel? What shape, size, colour, texture is it?* \n\nMindfulness exercises like that would usually tide me over any overwhelming emotions. But this time, it was not working. I felt the hairs on my arm stand on end, and little goosebumps appeared down the lengths of my arms and legs. \n\nMy neck was tickling with an odd sensation. \n\nStill, I sat there, knowing that OCD would do anything do be back again. That it was just my brain trying to fall back to the once-familiar patterns of me hiding from my obsessive thoughts with my compulsive behaviours. So I froze, and refused to move a muscle. My breath was getting ragged, but I knew this would all pass. \n\nAfter a while, the fear started to pass. I could feel my heart rate going back to normal, the cold sweat on my palms easing up, and my muscles beginning to relax. \n\nI couldn’t help but feel a rush of triumph. Another win against OCD, or the vestiges of it.\n\nA loud thud came from the red container, startling me so intensely that I could almost swear my stomach got lodged in my throat. Adrenaline raged through my body and I choked back a scream. \n\n*I imagined that.* I thought frantically to myself. My overactive imagination and nerves must have…\n\nAnother loud thud, then a series of thumping. It sounded like something was trying to get out. \n\nThis time, I screamed, a shrill piercing sound that cut through the quiet of the building. \n\nI sprang into action, and made a mad dash for the clinic door. I swung it shut behind me and ran, then paused. \n\nMy whole body was rigid with terror, but I knew I had to lock up the clinic. Confidential information and stuff. \n\nI looked around, and saw that the security guard stationed at the entrance of the building had looked up in surprise, probably due to my scream. His eyes met mine, and he began to stand up and walk towards me. \n\n*There was someone here with me. Everything was going to be okay. It was probably a mouse. No, a …a…* \n\nMy brain couldn’t formulate a creature that could possibly be tucked away in that box of toys. But before I could think too much about it, I forced my feet back a few steps, grabbed the clinic key and jabbed it into the lock. Thankfully, despite my shaking hands, the key slid right in. I locked the door and fled, running past the confused and concerned security guard. I wanted to tell him to run too, but I knew how crazy I would sound. I couldn’t afford to be seen as the crazy psychologist running from an imaginary demon. \n\nWhen I finally got home, I sank into my sofa and cried. I felt a mixture of shame, horror and confusion. I must have imagined it, I knew, but it seemed so real. Was I going crazy? Did I have schizophrenia? Onset of psychosis and hallucinations can start in the early 30s. Did I really have schizophrenia? \n\nAs the thoughts flew through my mind, I looked around the living room for signs of any red containers. None at all. Then I walked around the house, and thankfully, no red containers anywhere I could see. \n\nRed isn’t my favourite colour, and for that, I was incredibly grateful. \n\nI brewed myself a hot cup of tea, and thought about who I could talk to about the incident, who would be compassionate and non-judgmental. Someone who would not think less of me as a psychologist. \n\nProbably Lynn. I settled down in bed, for once not caring that I hadn’t showered, and pulled the comforter over me. Sipping the hot tea under the comforter, I began to feel better. I kept writing and rewriting the text to Lynn, worrying about how crazy I would sound. \n\nSomething shifted below the bed. Like a box moving along the floor. \n\nI froze, fingers paused in mid text. My chest tightened painfully.\n\n*Should I call the police?* I wondered. *But what if I’m hallucinating? That would out me as psychotic to everyone.* \n\nI tapped my phone screen to the dial page just in case. \n\nI couldn’t bring myself to look under the bed. I just sat there, frozen. \n\n*The fucking first aid kit,* I realised. *The red box containing first aid supplies. Under my bed.* \n\nI was crying silently at this point, trembling with tears rolling down my cheeks. \n\nAfter hearing another thud from under the bed, I finally sprang into action. \n\nI shot out from my bed room and right out the door, thankful that my phone case was one of those that had hooks, pockets and compartments for holding my house keys my credit card and my identification card. I shot straight out of the house, and kept running. \n\nBy the time I stopped, I was four blocks away from my house. I finally took the time to calm down, and took a taxi to the nearest hotel. \n\nAt the reception, I requested for a charging cable for my phone, and that the room be cleared of any red containers. I ignored the look of judgment and confusion on the receptionist’s face. I didn’t have to explain myself to anyone, especially not in this shitty situation. \n\nNow, after a hot shower to clear my head, I’m painstakingly typing this out on my phone. You know, just in case I’m not going crazy and a demon is really after me, I want someone to know what happened to me. \n\nI’ll probably go see another psychologist, there’s no avoiding that now.  I’ll take time off. Work has been stressful and that probably fuelled my mental breakdown. \n\nIf you guys have any experiences like this, and survived, please do let me know how you got out of it. I would really appreciate it. Or if you’ve hallucinations, well, I guess we could form a support group or something. \n\nFuck. Someone just banged on the wall. It’s just the next guest next door being an asshole, right[?](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkSeas/)",

        "text": "My grandma was very health conscious. She studied nutrition, kept exercising, and even dived into some supernatural things to live long.\n\nOne month before my grandma died, she accidentally broke her arm and was hospitalized. Fortunately, she recovered quickly. One night, I came to visit her with some fruit, about to put down these things, and went to work. I worked part-time at a convenience store in a 24-hour convenience store with duty on the night shift that day with a girl, Nana.\n\nA short distance away from the inpatient building where my grandmother stayed, I heard a faint sound. Like crying, like singing. Walking forward, the voice became clearer.\n\n\"Night Crying,\" I thought. \"Someone died.\"\n\nI must explain to you what \"Night Crying\" is. It's a tradition in our town. It is said that after a person dies, his ghost doesn’t leave and just wanders around the world because there are things hard to let go. They could be something unfinished or someone continually loved. To make the ghost release the past and go to his destination (I don’t know where it is), his family will invite a specialist to make a night crying rite. The guy will sing a song of nostalgia and exhortation in a deeply mournful tone, looking back at the past, and advising the ghost to get over the death fact and move on.\n\nAlthough I've never actually heard night crying, I guessed it's just that. \n\nLouder and louder with my approaching. I saw a woman in black clothes. She was facing me, waving her hands and shaking her head, sometimes leaning down, looking up. It was kind of scary, so I quickened my pace and walked close to the wall, wishing I could hide in the gap in the wall.\n\nThe song sometimes was a low murmur. It was like hundreds of leather drums beating together, and the dull voice contains huge energy. Sometimes it was a heart-piercing scream. The emotion was so intense that I couldn't tell whether it is sadness or anger. Even though I tried very hard to avoid understanding the lyrics, there was one line catching my attention.\n\n“Death comes with a crawl. Death comes with a pounce. It doesn’t matter how you die. Make your death count in a while.”\n\nOuch. I ran as hard as I could, as if the ground under my feet was no longer a solid road, but flying cloth, flowing water, things that could not bear any weight.\n\nFinally entered the building. The walls largely cut off part of the song, but the faint voice still floated in the air. The nurse at the front desk saw me coming in and smiled at me. My heart felt more at ease.\n\n\"Did someone die?\" I asked.\n\n\"Every moment. Here is the hospital.\"\n\nI just ended the conversation and went back to grandma's room. I opened the door. she was lying on her side facing the window. It was open, and the light poured directly onto the bed. \n\nShe turned over, and said, \"You back.\"\n\n\"Did the sound outside bother you?\"\n\n\"Sound?\"\n\nThen I told her what I saw and heard.\n\n“It doesn’t matter how you die. Make your death count in a while.” I repeated.\n\nHer face turned uneasy. The air suddenly froze, only the annoying singing floating in the sky.\n\n\"Is it all right?\"\n\n\"Terrible. \"\n\nShe was always afraid of death and refused any death news. \n\n\"It's okay. It's none of our business.\" I caressed her grey hair, trying to comfort her.\n\n\"You have better sleep now and I'll come to see you when you wake up.\"\n\n\"Where are you going?\" \n\n\"Work. I'm on the night shift tonight.\"\n\nShe closed her eyes, different from the usual, the chest upping and downing kind of violently.\n\n\"Don’t go.\"\n\n\"Ah?\"\n\n\"Just stay.\" She looked at me firmly.\n\n\"Okay, okay. I'm not leaving. \"\n\nThen I gave Nana a call. \"Nana, my grandma is not feeling well and I have asked Arthur (the manager) for a leave tonight.\"\n\n\"Sorry to hear that and hope your grandma gets better soon. Oh God Damn.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Oh, sorry not about you. My ex keeps calling in and I'm so sick of it.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh. Anyway, thank you.\"\n\nGrandma and I slept together and she held my hand. The moonlight outside just shone in, and the walls reflected a gloomy blue light. Under such circumstances, everything became soft and the noise outside was also getting further and further away. \n\nI was tired and my consciousness was to blur. But grandma was whispering.\n\nA phone call woke me up in the morning. Arthur asked me to go back to the store.\n\n\"Just go,\" Grandma said with a weak smile.\n\nI kissed her on the cheek, meanwhile feeling an unnatural heat radiating from her skin.\n\n“Gran, you are hot. Are you ok?”\n\n“The body temperature rises in the morning. And you should go.”\n\n\"I'll be back soon.\"\n\nI was shocked by what I saw. A cordon surrounds the store. There stood several police officers.\n\nThe building’s outer wall was burnt to blackness, and the inside was messy. Arthur was walking to me. \n\n\"What happened?\" \n\n\"Terrible. It got fired last night.\"\n\n\"Where is Nana?\"\n\nArthur held his head, choked up, and said, \"She, she was burned to death. Her damn ex-boyfriend murdered her. Held the door and burned her alive.\"\n\nMy mind went blank.\n\nWhen I was still in a mess, a call came in.\n\n\"This is Francis Hospital. I am sorry to inform you that your grandmother is not well.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSevere muscular dehydration. It usually occurs at high temperatures. But that was how my grandma died.\n\nOn the seventh day of grandma's death, uncle Jay invited a man to do the “night crying” for grandma. But his song was completely different from the last time I heard it.\n\n“I once heard a night crying song. That is Death comes with a crawl. Death comes with a pounce. It doesn’t matter how you die. Make your death count in a while.”\n\n“Honestly, it is not night crying songs.” The man said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Death comes with a crawl. Death comes with a pounce. It doesn’t matter how you die. Make your death count in a while.”\n\nSince then, I've often hummed this song. Something is growing in my mind, but I have no way to test this thought.\n\nNow here is the chance.\n\nI'm standing on the edge of the playground. Boys and girls are running and chasing happily around the track. The afternoon sun makes them shine. \n\nWhat is incompatible with this beautiful scene is that there is a woman in white standing in the middle of the playground. She is twisting her body and singing the song that I am familiar with.\n\nGrandma is dead and no more deals this time. The only thing I can do is wait. \n\nWhat form will my late death come?  But “It doesn’t matter how you die. Make your death count in a while.”\n\nTick tock. Tick tock.",

        "text": "I always wanted to be a park ranger, for as long as I can remember.  Being out in nature - hiking, camping, and fishing - that was pretty much all I wanted to do as a kid.  Once I realized that profession existed, it was my only career pursuit.  And I trained for it like an astronaut going to outer space.  \n\nReading up on all of the necessary qualifications, I learned that it was a pretty daunting undertaking in a lot of ways.  To be a park ranger, you need to be an expert outdoorsman, you need to be physically strong and have good endurance.  You need to be confident with firearms if you’re working in an area with bears and cougars.  And you need to have first aid training and a range of other certifications.  \n\nBut those hurdles didn’t stop me.  They inspired me. \n\nThroughout my late teens and early twenties I had a corkboard on my bedroom wall with every park ranger requirement listed on it, flanked by photos of my favorite national parks, and I checked the qualifications off one by one, celebrating as I achieved them.  Living at home with my parents I saved up every penny I earned - with the goal of going to school for Conservation Enforcement - one of several programs geared towards people in my aspiring line of work.  Eventually I got my diploma from a nearby community college - which was about all that I could afford.     \n\nIt took a while, and I worked a lot of shitty odd jobs, but eventually I was hired full time by the forestry service as a fire lookout.  This was after at least thirty rejected applications.  By that point the recruiters probably knew my resume off by heart, without even reading it.\n\nI was thrilled, and accepted the job with a cry of joy over the phone, to which my boss laughed and said he was looking forward to meeting me.  \n\nThroughout my on-the-job training, I picked things up quickly, and my supervisor, named Ross, said I was a natural.  It wasn’t long before he was sending me out alone to clear brush or do simple tasks, despite the fact that he was supposed to be shadowing me all the time.  He said he trusted me, and that it took a lot to gain his trust.\n\nOn my last day of training at Fire Tower 14 we were sitting in the cabin playing chess, when Ross noticed something in the distance - a bit of smoke rising up out of the trees.  It was just a wisp of white smoke - indicative of a campfire.\n\n“We should go check that out,” Ross said, handing the binoculars to me and pointing.  \n\nI saw it immediately and nodded, thinking it would be nice to get out and do something different.  The routine of clearing brush and taking out the trash, reading books and playing board games and cards, was getting monotonous.  It was late afternoon and there were still several hours of sunlight left.  \n\nI grabbed my backpack and my rifle, filled my canteen with water, and was about to set out, when Ross muttered something over my shoulder.  \n\n“Son of a bitch,” he said, a little louder this time.  It wasn’t like him to curse, and I was a little surprised to hear him do it.  Ross reminded me of a boy scout in a man’s body - his enthusiasm for the job was infectious, and he was almost always in a good mood.\n\n“What?” I asked, walking over to join him.  \n\n“Another one.  Nobody bothers to get a camping permit these days anymore.”\n\nHe pointed at another fire burning in the distance, this one a little closer.  \n\nNormally we wouldn’t go out to bother campers, but these were not registered camping sites, and people like that often didn’t bother to clean up after themselves, and sometimes got injured out in the woods, since they weren’t prepared.  Most people who care enough to go camping properly will actually acquire a camping permit.  They know it isn’t worth the risk of being fined.  \n\nThese people clearly didn’t care.  \n\n“You know what,” Ross said, looking at me.  “This is actually perfect.  It’s your last day of training, which means next time something like this happens you’ll be on your own - nobody around for miles.  So let’s split up the two offenders and we’ll each take one.  I’ll be in radio contact with you the whole time.  They look like they’re only a couple miles away from each other.  How’s that sound?”\n\nDespite the fact that I’d been eager for the job my entire life, now that I was faced with the prospect of doing it alone I was a little nervous.  But I nodded my head, agreeing with his plan.  \n\n“Alright, let’s do it,” I said. \n\n“Just like we practiced,” he told me as we began to climb down the stairs from the tower.  “Don’t get into any confrontations.  If they want to get into an argument you walk away and call me for backup, otherwise just give them the citation and move on.  Tell them to find a new campsite or we’ll be back to confiscate their gear.  You know, the usual routine.”\n\nThe two of us took the jeep which was parked at the base of the tower and drove down the dirt trail until we saw the first vehicle, pulled over at the side of the road.  It was empty, with no one inside.  \n\n“Okay, you take this one.  Radio me once you make contact.  Remember, don’t take any unnecessary risks.  If anything doesn’t seem right just let me know.”\n\nHe looked very nervous all of a sudden, and it was making me more worried than I had been a second before.  He looked like he wanted to say something else, and opened his mouth as if he were about to do so, but then he shook his head, as if telling himself not to.  After a few seconds of awkwardness, I reassured him I’d radio him once I made contact.\n\nHe told me to get going, and stay safe, driving off once I’d shut the passenger door of the jeep.  \n\nI was left alone, surrounded by wilderness.  Taking a deep breath and letting it out, I began to march into the trees, towards the smell of campfire smoke in the distance.  \n\nThe brush was thick, since there was no real trail here.  But I could see where the campers had dragged their cooler through the shrubbery, and could make out their boot prints in the mud.  If I had to guess, there were at least three or four of them.  \n\nIt didn’t take long before I came across a clearing, and standing in the middle of it was a large stone archway.  \n\nThe human-made structure was about a ten minute walk from the road and looked like a bridge constructed for a railroad to pass over above it.  But it made no sense for it to be way out here in the middle of the forest, far from any civilization.  And far from any active railroads.   \n\nA dirt path emerged from nowhere, leading towards this arch, and going underneath it to the other side.  \n\nI didn’t know the area well enough to say that this was completely out of the ordinary - but to my eyes it did look unusual.  Ross hadn’t mentioned any decommissioned railroads passing through this part of the forest, but then again it could have been long out of use and ancient.  \n\nWhen I approached the stone archway, I got a queasy rising feeling in my stomach, like when you’re a kid in the backseat of a car and your parents are driving down a hilly dirt road and you go over a steep hill too fast on the opposite side.  Looking through the archway, I saw the sky was a bruised shade of purple on the other side.  Black clouds floated along, in stark contrast to the clear blue sky which I’d seen from the watchtower. \n\nI looked over my shoulder and the sky was blue.  I looked straight ahead again and saw it was that surreal purple shade - but only on *this* side of the archway. \n\n“What the hell,” I muttered to myself, walking through the stone archway to the other side.  The moment that I did, my body broke out in pins and needles, as if every limb had fallen asleep for just a second, but then the sensation passed.  \n\nI felt as if I had crossed over through some threshold into another world.  But I convinced myself I was just being foolish, letting my adrenaline get to me.  This was simply a new and scary experience, being alone by myself out here, but I would need to get used to it fast.  \n\nSteeling myself with a deep breath, I squared my shoulders and continued marching forward.  \n\nThe forest was still the same, but the sky was that dark purple shade, and I didn’t understand why it would look like that.  It was still a few hours until sunset, so it wasn’t being caused by the sun’s approach towards the horizon.  It was something else.  \n\nA forest fire, maybe?\n\n“Ross, come in, Ross,” I said into my radio, which was clipped to my uniform shirt.\n\nThere was a burst of static but nothing after that.  \n\n“Ross.  Status update, come in, Ross?”\n\nAgain, there was nothing.\n\n“Great.  Some backup you are.”\n\nThe forest swallowed me up again as I walked along the path until it disappeared.  Strangely, the woods were difficult to traverse in this section.  Huge trees blocked my path, their low branches impossible to get around.  \n\nI had completely lost the campers’ trail, and I was starting to worry I’d lost my bearings altogether, so I pulled out my compass to regain my trajectory.  \n\nWhen I looked down at the face of the compass, it didn’t make any sense.  \n\nIt wasn’t pointing in any one direction.  Instead, it spun around in lazy half and quarter circles, reversing and changing direction constantly.  Then it began to spin in a maddening arc, faster and faster, going in circles until the glass broke and the needle flew off into the sky, completely unhinged from the device.  I heard it whiz past my ear like a stray bullet.  \n\n*Okay, that was weird.*\n\nI tried to comprehend what was happening.  What could cause a compass to do that?\n\nA strong magnet?  \n\nThat was impossible, though.  All of this was impossible.  \n\nI looked up at the sky and traced the bruised purple color, turning my head so I could see behind me.  \n\nThe violet shade now covered the entire sky, including behind me where it had been bright blue just minutes prior.  \n\n*What the hell was going on?*\n\nI turned around and started back, my heart beating fast, my legs trembling and numb, feeling like blocks of wood attached at the waist.  \n\nHad a nuclear bomb detonated somewhere?  Was this the end of the world?  Was that why the sky looked so strange now?\n\nI keyed the radio again, hoping I would get a response from Ross as I blundered through the forest feeling sick.  It felt like I was going to throw up.  \n\n“ROSS!  COME IN, ROSS!” I practically screamed into the radio.  \n\nBut there was no answer.  \n\nI began to run, picking up my pace.  \n\nIt was that archway.  That FUCKING archway.  I should have never gone through it.  I could tell it was wrong.  I could tell it was evil.  That feeling of pins and needles, that rising sensation in my gut, every part of my body had been trying to tell me not to go through it, but I hadn’t listened.  \n\nI’d heard stories before, read tales on the internet of back rooms and hidden interdimensional portals which led to places like this that shouldn’t exist.  Dimensions locked away through space and time and other mechanisms we don’t understand which people stumble into and can’t escape.  \n\nStairs that lead to nowhere but take a portion of your lifespan should you decide to climb them, causing you to disappear from your friends and family for untold lengths of time.  People vanished in national parks all the time, and there was no explanation for it.  \n\nAt least, not until now.  \n\nI pushed aside the brush and made my way out of the forest and into the clearing where the archway had been.  \n\nMy heart sank as I stared at the blank spot where it had been.  \n\nThe stone archway was gone.\n\n*\n\nI stood there for a while, just staring at the blank space where it had previously stood.  \n\nBut it didn’t change the fact that the thing had vanished.  \n\nI spun around in circles, thinking maybe I had lost my way and gone off track.  Maybe this was all in my head and I had just lost track of time, that was why the sky was purple and why I was having trouble finding my way back.  \n\nI wasn’t trapped in another dimension, I’d just spaced out and the sun was setting.  That was all it was.  Nothing more.  I convinced myself this was true, even though part of me knew it wasn’t.\n\nIf I kept walking in this direction, I told myself, I would hit the dirt road eventually.  I was sure enough of my bearings to know that the road lay in this direction - and I could simply walk back to Tower 14 from there, once I found it.  Sure, Ross would be pissed.  He would tell his bosses that I needed more training, and that I wasn’t ready yet.  \n\nBut that was okay.  Maybe I wasn’t.  Despite all my years of getting ready for this day, maybe I was still just an amateur.\n\nWith this new plan in mind, I kept walking straight back the way I’d come.  I knew better than to push it when I’d already lost my bearings, not to mention my compass.  The best bet was just to walk back to the safety of the road.  \n\nThe longer I walked, though, the more I began to realize what I had suspected deep down was true.  The road was not there.  \n\n“Oh no, oh no, oh no,” I muttered to myself as my progress came to a halt.  “It’s not here.”\n\nThe road should have been here.  Even if I was slightly off course I should have seen it by now.  But it was nowhere to be found.  \n\nWorse than that, the sky was getting dimmer with those horrible black clouds, covering up the patches of purple and filling them in with malignant darkness.  \n\n“ROSS! Please, come in!” I yelled into the radio for what felt like the hundredth time.  \n\nA clap of thunder boomed overhead, sounding discordant and wrong to my ears.  It was a bad imitation of thunder - a foley artist still learning the ropes as he shook out a giant sheet of tin like a rug on cleaning day.  It warbled and shook the ground, the reverberations lasting far too long afterwards.  \n\nThat was what did it.  The sound of that alien thunder brought me over the edge of certainty and I knew for sure in that moment what I had suspected all along.  \n\nThis wasn’t the national park.  This wasn’t even Earth anymore.  At least, not my Earth.  \n\nI truly had slipped into another dimension through that archway.  Despite how mad it all sounded, I was on the other side of some multidimensional gateway.  And not only that, but now the gateway was gone.  I was trapped here.  \n\nTurning around, I decided I needed to go back to the place where I’d found it.  Even if it was gone now, it would have to return eventually.  That was my only hope.  I couldn’t stay in this place.  I didn’t belong here.  \n\nAnd who knew what creatures might lurk in a forest like this after dark?  Even in our world there were wolves, coyotes, mountain lions, and bears.  I shuddered to think what version of predator might live unchecked in this universe, without people around to keep their numbers down.  \n\nAs if the forest had read my mind, I heard a rustling sound to my right.  The light was dimmer now and it was difficult to see, but I thought I noticed something a ways off in the distance, ducking behind trees and hiding from view, following me through the dark woods.  \n\nWas it a person?  It kind of looked like one.  \n\n“Hello?” I called out, my voice breaking with fear.  \n\n“Hello?” it called back, sounding like a tape recording of my own voice, slightly sped up and slowed down halfway through the word.  \n\nThe thing paused momentarily as it ducked out from behind the trees, looking at me, measuring me.  Standing in plain view for the first time, as if letting itself be seen.  \n\nMy skin turned ice cold when I caught a full glimpse of it.  \n\nIt saw me, that was for sure.  And it was following me.  \n\nThe dark, humanoid shape had grayish blue skin and at least two sets of arms.  It walked on two legs and ducked behind each tree as it passed by, so as not to be seen.  Its face was shrouded in long black hair, which covered its visage like heavy curtains.  \n\nIt was completely naked and unclothed, its genitals covered by its long hair, and carrying nothing with it.  To my eyes it looked like an animal.  A creature more than a person, although it walked on two legs and resembled a human.  The extra set of arms was the most jarring aspect of it, though.  And made it feel so much more like a nightmare.  Like this couldn’t possibly be happening.  \n\nMy heart was pounding fast as I tripped over branches and fallen trees, stumbling and rising to my feet and looking to see the thing was even closer now.  It was on a diagonal path through the trees, pursuing me but also making its way closer and closer to me.  \n\nFor the first time I saw its eyes behind the mask of tangled hair - they were reflective and gold like a cat in the night.  And then I saw its teeth, and its rancid, rotten smile.  It rubbed its four hands together in a ball of moving flesh and fingers, like an excited old man about to eat his favorite meal.\n\nThe creature knew I was scared, and it was enjoying itself.  Enjoying the hunt.  \n\nAnother twig snapped underfoot and at first I thought it was my own foot which had done it, since the sound was so close, but then I realized it was only a few feet away.  \n\nWhich meant… \n\nI spun around just in time to see a face appear in front of me.  \n\nAt first I thought it was another one of those things, and almost took a wild swing at it.  But then I saw the face was human.  \n\nIt was a man wearing a park ranger uniform.  His hair was shoulder-length and greasy and he had a long beard which was untrimmed and scraggly.  \n\n“GET BEHIND ME!” he yelled suddenly and I did as he asked instinctively, hearing the sound of movement coming toward us through the brush from where the creature had been.  \n\nThe sound of the rifle’s report was deafening.  My ears were still ringing when he fired again a few moments later.  \n\n“That’s my last bullet,” he said, grabbing my arm and pulling me to my feet.  “I hope you brought some ammunition with you - those things don’t like to die.”\n\nNoises could be heard behind us and I realized that the creature was still in pursuit, despite two well-placed rifle rounds.  I was compelled to follow the strange man as he raced ahead of me, looking back at me occasionally to see if I was still trailing him.  \n\nI didn’t have time to ask questions.  I didn’t have time to think about the fact that the archway was getting further and further away with each step.  \n\nAll I could do was run, and soon the sounds of more racing footsteps joined the first creature.  There were several of them, and they were all hungry.  Moving in a pack like humanoid wolves.\n\nI only hoped this man knew where he was going.  And that he had a plan to [survive.](https://youtu.be/5V3obVKO4xA)  \n\n[JG](https://www.reddit.com/r/JGcreepypastas/comments/zpi8zt/master_story_list_updated_regularly/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[TCC]https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)",

        "text": "It was our first date, and I wanted it to be memorable. So, I decided to take her to the tarot show that had been advertised on the radio all week. It was supposed to be a fun and spooky experience, but little did we know that we were in for a terrifying ride.\n\nAs we entered the dimly lit tent, the smell of incense filled the air, and I could see the excitement in her eyes. The fortune teller, dressed in a long black robe, welcomed us, and we took our seats at a small table. She began shuffling the tarot cards and asked us to pick three each.\n\nMy girlfriend went first, and the fortune teller studied the cards intently before declaring that she had chosen the Death card. My girlfriend laughed nervously, thinking it was all a show. But, as I picked my cards, the atmosphere changed.\n\nThe fortune teller's face grew serious as she looked at the cards in front of her. \"The cards are telling me that you both are in grave danger,\" she said. I rolled my eyes, thinking she was just trying to scare us. But then, the ground beneath us began to shake.\n\n\"What the hell is going on?\" my girlfriend shouted, gripping my arm tightly. The fortune teller's eyes widened as she began to speak in a language I couldn't understand. Suddenly, a group of people appeared out of nowhere, dressed in long robes and holding candles.\n\n\"We have been waiting for you,\" one of them said, and before we knew it, they had surrounded us. I tried to stand up, but they pushed me back down, and the fortune teller began to chant. The room grew colder as the candles flickered, and I could feel a sense of dread growing inside me.\n\nMy girlfriend began to cry, and I tried to comfort her, but I was just as scared. Then, as the chanting grew louder, I saw something move in the shadows. It was a figure, dressed in black, with glowing red eyes.\n\nThe figure stepped forward, and the fortune teller bowed before him. \"Master, we have brought you the sacrifices you requested,\" she said, and my blood ran cold. Sacrifices? What the hell was going on?\n\nThe figure approached us, and I could see the wicked smile on his face. \"You two will make excellent offerings,\" he said, and I knew then that we were doomed.\n\nWe tried to fight, but the robed figures were too strong. They bound us, and before we knew it, we were being dragged outside. The moon was full and bright, and I could see the twisted faces of our captors in its light.\n\nThey took us to a clearing in the woods, where a circle of stones had been set up. The figure in black began to chant, and the others joined in. My girlfriend and I were forced into the center of the circle, and I could feel the heat of the fire they had lit.\n\nAs the chanting grew louder, I knew that this was the end. The figure in black raised his hands, and I closed my eyes, waiting for the inevitable. And then, everything went black.\n\nI woke up in a hospital bed, my body battered and broken. The doctors told me that my girlfriend was dead, and that I was lucky to be alive. But I didn't feel lucky. I felt like a prisoner, trapped in a nightmare that I could never escape. \n\nThe memory of that night haunted me for the rest of my life, and I could never forget the terror I had felt as I watched my girlfriend being taken from me. It was a date that I would never forget, but for all the wrong reasons.",

        "text": "Let me start this off by saying: do not fuck with a woman and her vacation. Trust me, it will help you out a lot in the long run.\n\nI fucked around and found out, and now I’m terrified of my girlfriend. I so desperately want to break up with her, but going by the repercussions I’ve suffered since denying her the dream vacation she suddenly wanted to go on within the week of proposing it, I’m scared of what she would do to me in retaliation.\n\nThis whole thing started the night I took my girlfriend out on a nice dinner date. We were all dressed up and went to a fancy and pretty expensive restaurant of her choosing.\n\nMy girlfriend, Karla, enjoys the finer things in life. She comes from a poorer background than most, so I can totally see why she likes the things she does. She likes higher end food (who doesn’t), fashion, cars, you get the point. I try to help fund her little adventures when I can, and love to see her smile when she’s having fun. Growing up she had to do whatever it took to survive, if not she’d probably be dead by now, so I have to admire her for that. Her strength is one of the many attributes about her that made me fall head-over-heels in the first place. \n\nI make good money at the company I work for so it was easy to spoil her every once in a while. Karla does well for herself too. She runs a small business that is pretty successful and growing by the day. Bottom line, we’re well off. Besides, The pure unbridled joy on her face was priceless compared to a new designer dress or handbag. \n\nKarla had just downed her second glass of the four-hundred dollar bottle of wine we ordered when she brought the topic up.\n\n “Hey babe? When was the last time we went on a trip?”\n\n“About six months ago, why?” I asked, recalling the fond memories of our time together.\n\n“I think we both deserve a break don’t you? We’ve been working hard and should go on a vacation!”\n\nI nodded in agreement, entertaining the idea in my head as I took a bite out of my juicy porterhouse. “Where are you thinking of going?”\n\n“I’m so glad you asked!” She squealed in delight. She then reached across the table to wrap my hands in hers. “I’ve been thinking we could go on a tropical cruise to the Bahamas!”\n\n“That sounds doable. When were you thinking of going?” I asked, taking a sip of wine. It definitely didn’t taste like four-hundred bucks worth, but Karla ordered before I could say anything. We had agreed that I’d cover the dinner so I was calculating how bad my pockets would be suffering after the date in the back of my head.\n\nAll the talk of vacation sprang on a sudden migraine, but that could’ve been due to the ridiculous and overwhelming sweetness of the wine Karla ordered. I was also under a lot of stress at the time, both financially and mentally. Being up for a huge promotion will do that to you.\n\n“Oh I wasn’t done, sweet cheeks.” She interrupted. \n\n“My bad, continue.” I said as I poured her another glass of red wine. \n\n“After the cruise I was thinking we could visit Japan! I hear the cherry blossoms are beautiful this time of year, and on the way home we could stop in Hawaii for a while to swim, drink, and explore!”\n\nShe looked so excited as she talked, but I had to be the reasonable one in this situation.\n\n“That’s quite the vacation you’ve dreamt up there, darling. How long would this trip even last? Between the cruise, the flights, and hotel stays, it would probably be a few weeks. I don’t know if I’d be able to take that much time off right now. You either. Not to mention how much a translator/guide would cost since neither of us speak Japanese or have ever been to Japan before.”\n\nHer smile turned into a frown. \n\n“Plus, it’s going to be pretty expensive between the two of us.” I added on.\n\nA defeated look filled her features.\n\n“Listen, I’m sure if we save up for a while we’d be able to afford to go on the trip. We’d probably have to save up for a year at most.”\n\nShe looked down at her plate shyly before she spoke,” Well actually… I was hoping we could leave by the end of next week or the week after that at the latest.”\n\nI had to take a beat to process her request. There was no way in hell I’d be able to get that much time off approved from work on such short notice. And to be quite honest, Karla’s lavish lifestyle was becoming difficult to maintain. Sure I loved to see her happy and all, but she was spending more than what she was making, so there was little of her money left for important things like rent and utilities that I had to continually make up the difference for. It didn’t help that she chose the large open concept apartment we live in. It’s beautiful, don’t get me wrong, but it’s in the richer part of the city so rent is outrageous and we barely use fifty percent of the space anyway. I had spoiled her so much since beginning our relationship, I’d created a small, bratty and demanding monster that always got her way.\n\nBesides, our last trip to Myrtle beach was enough for me. We ate good food, had fun at the beach and in the hotel room, what more did we need? International travel seemed fun and all, but if you think about it, it’s super taxing and just a lot. She was basically asking me to plan a two to four week multi-thousand dollar vacation in the span of like a week. Talk about unrealistic expectations!\n\n“Listen love bug,” I started nicely, trying to soften the blow. Knowing Karla, she was going to throw a fit when I essentially told her no. “I know you’re excited about this whole trip that you’ve got planned out in your head, but we’ve gotta be realistic here.”\n\n“Cecil.” She said, testingly. She gave me her signature bombastic side eye, daring me. Her whole expression read “I will scream right here and now if I don’t get my way.”\n\nI sighed. “Karla, I’ll be shitting bricks when you get to go on this vacation.”\n\nA hurt expression filled her beautiful features, but if I needed her to truly understand the gravity of something, I had to be blunt and harsh. \n\nShe downed the rest of her glass of wine before turning her head away to avoid looking at me. She rested her chin over her hands before she muttered something along the lines of,” Fine, have it your way.”\n\nThe rest of that dinner we ate in silence as she stewed. \n\nLeading up to this, those past few months it was like little earthquakes leading up to a massive volcanic explosion when it came to Karla. Always walking around eggshells. Looking back at it, there were so many warning signs. \n\nAn ominous feeling loomed over me and something in my gut told me that I’d come to regret this. And come to regret it I did. \n\nAbout a week after the date night dinner disaster, around the time Karla originally wanted to go on her dream vacation, she made me a bowl of maple and brown sugar oatmeal for breakfast. One thing that should be known is that Karla owns an e-commerce business and mainly works from home. So, if she has time in the mornings, she’ll make us breakfast while I get ready for work. If I’m extra lucky, she’ll even pack my lunch.\n\nI was running a bit behind that day, so she settled on something quick and easy to make for me, an unsuspecting bowl of oatmeal.\n\n“Here hun! Better eat it quickly, don’t want to be late or to let it get cold.” She said with a smile as she placed the bowl with the golden oats on our table for me. It seemed Karla had long since let go of her vacation whims by that point.\n\nI quickly sat down and grabbed a couple spoonfuls of the stuff. Karla hovered behind me the whole time. Eagerly watching me like an animal stalking its prey.\n\nThe usually sweet oatmeal tasted extremely bitter, and even a bit burnt. After the first bite, my lips started to tingle a little. At least the tingling took my taste away. I thought I could’ve been having an allergic reaction to eating the oatmeal, but it had never happened before. \n\n“Go on sweetie, take a couple more bites.” She urged as she gingerly lay her hands on my shoulders, starting to rub them a little. As time went on she started rubbing harder and harder, almost grinding her wrists into my shoulders.\n\n“Mm! So delicious!” I lied. I mixed the oatmeal around to see if she had somehow burnt the oatmeal, but all I found were the usual small bits of brown sugar that hadn’t melted down yet.\n\n“Be a good boy and finish your oatmeal, quickly for me, okay?” She whispered with a sickly sweet venom. \n\nAfter the fifth or sixth spoonful shoved into my mouth, I had to cough. My lips, mouth, and throat were still tingling. The feeling was getting more intense as time went on.\n\nShe gave me a water bottle which I graciously accepted, telling me that it would help with the tingling when I told her my mouth was on fire. After chugging it my mouth felt a little better.\n\nBefore I could question her or do anything else, Karla ushered me out of the apartment after I practically licked the bowl clean. Dazed, I rushed to work.\n\nTen minutes after arriving at work, my still tingling mouth started to fill with drool as I started to uncontrollably salivate. The intense urge to vomit came with it. I felt ill. My stomach was upset, I was ghostly pale, nauseous, and sweating buckets. It looked like I was an unsuspecting victim of the ice bucket challenge because of how much I had sweat through my work shirt. \n\nOne of my superiors took notice of my ghastly appearance during that morning's debrief meeting and asked if I was feeling alright. I didn’t get the chance to respond because I excused myself as I almost threw up all over him.\n\nThe second I was in front of a toilet in the men’s bathroom, everything in my stomach was unleashed into the toilet bowl with the same fury as a hurricane. I almost hurled again as chunks of gray oatmeal and acidic stomach juices swirled around the bowl when I flushed.\n\nI just chalked it up to a bad case of food poisoning from the shitty oatmeal Karla had prepared. \n\nNot a moment after I left the stall to clean myself up did the most intense, gut wrenching, pain fill my entire abdominal region. It felt like I had been stabbed with a sword and it was being thrust twisted inside of my guts. The most foul smelling cloud of gas left my tuchus, which thrusted me into another wave of pain as my knees went weak and buckled. Clutching my stomach, I slowly unbuckled my belt, pulled my pants down, and parked my ass on the toilet seat.\n\nIt felt like an eternity had passed of me trying to push out that god forsaken dookie. A grown man could’ve taken three showers with all the sweat that left every orifice of my body. My ass at one point was so wet, I had to push my hands against the stall to keep myself from slipping off my porcelain prison. I feared for my life. My heart was pounding so fast, I figured with all the stress my body was under I'd have a heart attack.  I truly thought I was going to die in that stall.  \n\nI don’t know what giving birth feels like, but I think pushing that demon spawn out of my butthole was pretty close to the feeling. There was a tiny splash of water and a small stream of wet ickiness that came after.\n\nI slowly gathered some toilet paper and gingerly wiped the ring of fire that was my rectum. The toilet paper was drenched in blood when I finished. I took a quick peek into the depths below and found a hard as rock gray pebble floating in the pinkish water.\n\nThat was the last straw for my body. A combination of exhaustion, blood loss, and dehydration caused me to slip in and out of consciousness. One second I was on the toilet, the next there’s blood dripping down between my legs as I lay pants-less on the floor of the bathroom stall with a puddle of blood leaking from my ass. I was surrounded by worried co-workers and I think I can remember the paramedics arriving. After that, nothing but a cool abyss.\n\nI thought I had died. It felt like I had died.\n\nI woke up in a sterile hospital room. My head was woozy and my stomach felt a shit ton better and lighter. It also felt stiff, tight, and ached a little.\n\nKarla was sitting besides me holding my hand, stroking her thumb along the back of my hand. She noticed I woke up and gave me a smile.\n\n“Oh, Pookie! I’m so glad you’re awake!” She then pressed the call button on the remote to my bed. “I was so worried about you.” \n\nA doctor then came into the room. Turns out I had been in and out of it for a week, though I don’t remember anything during that time.\n\nTurns out my coworkers had called an ambulance when they found me unresponsive in the bathroom. I sat there for an hour and half before I was found and was quickly rushed to hospital. After testing, they found I had some pretty severe burns to my mouth, tongue, and esophagus, along with a bowel obstruction. They rushed me into emergency surgery where about a foot and a half of my intestine was removed in what’s called a bowel resection.\n\nWhen the tested contents of my removed bowel came back, it was revealed that the blockage was quite literally a concrete casting of my intestine. The doctors think I must’ve ingested something containing a hefty, borderline lethal, amount of quick drying cement powder. \n\nAfter my doctor explained that to me, he went into detail about some serious damage that was done to my stomach. The best option, in his opinion, was a partial gastrectomy. Which is when a portion of your stomach is removed. Typically this kind of operation is performed on patients with stomach cancer or tumors. \n\nThey questioned me about what I ate that day, trying to determine how the cement ended up in my system, but I was still too weak and out of it to really answer them at the time. They asked me questions like,” Have you ever eaten and craved something people shouldn’t be eating?\n\nI just shrugged my shoulders and the doctor told me about a condition called pica, which makes you crave weird things like dirt. He told me I probably didn’t have it since I didn’t have a history of ingesting quick drying cement, but told me they’d do further testing just to rule it out.\n\nKarla talked the ears off the whole nursing staff about how unexpected all this was and how inconvenient it was for her. She even came up with a few theories of how it ended up in my system. One of them was about a McDonald’s breakfast burrito that came from a recently renovated McDonald’s. That one was rich. She told them all about how she was going to sue them for millions. Surprisingly nothing about oatmeal was brought up, though. \n\nFinally when all the doctors and nurses were gone, and I had finished the tomato soup I couldn’t taste because of the burns, Karla snuggled up real close  in the hospital bed with me. She stroked my matted hair and ran her fingers up and down my arm before quietly whispering in my ear,” You’ve shit your bricks, now where’s my vacation?”\n\nA disturbing chill crept down my spine after she said that. It was then that I came to the realization she had somehow mixed quick drying cement powder into my oatmeal that morning. After doing some googling I discovered that it takes up to two minutes for the powder to dry and harden when mixed with water. Her menacing smile as she handed me that water bottle is permanently tattooed on the back of my eyelids.\n\nThat conversation was a week ago. I’m getting discharged from the hospital soon. Karla and I have been looking at hotel bookings in Japan a week out from when our cruise leaves in a few days. I don’t have to worry about getting anything ready since she’s been packed for weeks at this point. She just had to wait a little bit so I could get approved medical leave off of work to rest and recover a bit, but we’re doing it. We’re going on her dream vacation. \n\nAll it cost me were parts of my stomach, intestine, and whatever was in my 401k.\n\nI don’t want to go on a stupid fucking vacation. I can’t taste for shit, I’m still in relative pain after my two operations, and I can’t even bare to be in the same room as her anymore. The nightmares are the worst part. Every dream is dominated with the memories of the bathroom, blood, pain, and Karla’s uncaring and lifeless eyes.\n\nBut, I’ve learned my lesson by now. When Karla, the absolute *love* of my life, wants something, she’ll get it. By any means necessary. \n\nShe’s also been hinting to me that she wants me to propose on this vacation. She’s sent me photos of various, expensive, engagement rings and is gabbing on and on about the nail appointment she made for the day before we leave. So, it looks like we’re also going to get married. I’ll be trapped with her for life, because she might literally take it away if I ever broke up with her. She’s proven herself very capable already. \n\nAnother take away from this whole experience is that my girlfriend is a terrifying woman who takes everything way too literally. \n\nI’ve also developed a debilitating phobia of oatmeal that causes me to vomit every time I see it. Safe to say I’m never, ever, eating it again.",

        "text": "[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11mtodu/my_stint_as_a_fire_lookout_a_couple_of_visitors/)\n\nI lay on the floor, my stomach muscles unclenching after the coughing fit. My wet clothes left damp smudges on the floorboards. Neither Martina nor Roger spoke. Roger, presumed missing, was alive and communicating through the radio meant for contact between the lookouts. But he wasn’t with Martina, and he wasn’t with me. \n\n“We need to call the Station,” I said into the radio.\n\n“No.” The response from Roger was immediate and forceful. “We can’t get them involved.”\n\n“Why? They can help. We need help don’t we?”\n\n“Tom, is it?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“There’s something going on up here Tom. It is at a critical stage. We cannot have outside interference now.”\n\n“What? What the hell is happening?”\n\n“Tom, listen to me. We have already come so far. It is almost done. There are forces at work in this forest that wish us to fail, and we cannot let that happen. I have the situation under control. You have to trust me.”\n\nI let a few seconds of silence pass.\n\n“You can trust him Tom.” Martina’s voice, faint and unconvincing.\n\nI was at a loss. “What am I supposed to do?”\n\nRoger again. “Nothing Tom. Give your weather reports. Watch for fires. Be a lookout. That is all anyone is asking you to do. I need time, that is all.”\n\nI grabbed the radio that was the link to the Station and tapped the button. I put it back down on the shelf. I peered through the window to Martina’s lookout across the valley and imagined talking directly to her. “This doesn’t feel right.”\n\nShe responded. “We need to trust Roger.”\n\nMy eyes fell to the radio on the shelf. I played an imaginary conversation with the Ranger on duty. \n\n*There are monsters and demons up here and the man who went missing is talking to me through the radio. Come and help please.* \n\nEven if they came up here, they would only drag me back down off the mountain. In their minds they would assume I had gone full Jack Torrance in a matter of days. \n\nI talked into the radio for Martina and Roger. “Who was she, the woman outside the lookout?”\n\nA few seconds passed before Roger responded. “She is the one we are fighting against. She is the one trying to stop us.”\n\n“What if she comes back?”\n\n“Tom, nothing up here can hurt you unless you let it. She can only come in if you invite her in.”\n\n“How do you know?”\n\n“I have been on watch on this mountain for more than a decade.”\n\nI thought back to the shadow from the night before. That was not a woman in a blue dress. “What is the other thing up here?”\n\n“What other thing?” Roger sounded genuine in his concern.\n\n“A dark shadow. It carved a triangle on the door to the outhouse while I was inside.”\n\n“You don’t need to worry about that. It is the woman who you must watch out for. If you see her again you need to call.”\n\n“You’ll be listening?”\n\n“I’ll be listening. I can rely on you can’t I Tom?”\n\nI paused before answering. “Yes.” I put the radio down and sighed. \n\nI didn’t like it. I didn’t like any of it. I needed time to think. I decided to wait before contacting the Station. I would need to send down my weather report at 9am the next day. Should I tell them something then? I didn’t want to put Roger in danger. \n\nThe clouds parted on the horizon and the setting sun glowed yellow and turned the sky crimson. The weather had passed for now. The container for the fire wood was barely half-full. I eyed the enclosure housing the logs outside. It would be better to do it in the light.\n\nThe air held a fragile warmth in the glow of the sun. I removed my damp sweater and hung it over the balustrade at the edge of the deck. I took a deep breath and the warm air felt good in my lungs. I watched and listened for the woman in blue or a dark shadow hiding in the trees on the slope. Seeing nothing, I stepped off the deck and made for the wood pile.\n\nIn the valley to the east a light glowed in a bare patch between the trees. I squinted and caught the smudge of a blue tent. It must be Rebecca, the hiker who signed the visitor’s book, making camp in the clearing. I grabbed an armful of wood and hauled it inside. I hoped for her sake there would be no more rain tonight. But maybe she liked the rain, some people do.\n\nI built the fire as the sun dropped below the horizon. In the last of the daylight I looked east and tried to find Rebecca’s tent. The outhouse and wood enclosure blocked my view. I took the binoculars from the shelf and went back outside and to the edge of the peak and found her tent. It was strange, I came up here to be alone and removed from the world, and yet my attention was drawn to the only other person I had seen since Hitch left me on the first day.\n\nThe binoculars brought her camp site into focus. Her brown backpack poked out the front of the tent. A light hung from a tree a few paces away. I couldn’t see Rebecca. \n\nI lowered the binoculars. To the right of her camp a wisp of light-grey smoke rose into the sky. Almost imperceptible, like the exhale of warm breath on a cold day. Could it be a fire? I lifted the binoculars back to my eyes and scanned up and down trying to pinpoint the smoke. I latched onto it, but could not see a flame. \n\nAnd then something moved. A dark shape pushed through the trees, branches shaking in its wake. The column of smoke shifted with it. It was as if it were a giant lump of black burning coal rolling through the forest. \n\nWhat the hell?\n\nIt made a beeline for the blue tent of Rebecca’s camp. I pulled the binoculars down and surveyed the scene from a distance. The wispy smoke fanned across the forest like the exhaust from a fast-moving train. Rebecca’s tent stood in its path. \n\nI yelled out. I told her to get out of her tent and run, but she was too far away.\n\nThrough the binoculars she emerged from the tent, a tiny ant scurrying across the ground. She had seen her pursuer, or heard it, or both, and ran into the forest. The dark shape came for her. As it moved through the trees it looked almost human. But it moved with unnatural speed. The gap closed and I lost them both behind a thicket of trees. Neither Rebecca or the shape emerged from the other side. The column of smoke rose stationary above the trees.\n\nI ran inside and picked up the radio. “Martina, Roger, is someone there?”\n\nMartina’s voice. “I’m here Tom.”\n\n“There’s something in the forest, smoke.”\n\n“A fire? Where?”\n\n“East of my lookout. In the next valley. It took her?”\n\n“It took who? What are you talking about? Is there a fire?”\n\n“There’s smoke. I saw smoke. It took her.” \n\n“Give me a bearing.”\n\n“East. It’s east. Draw a direct line from your lookout to mine and keep going.”\n\n“I don’t see anything Tom.”\n\n“It took her. I saw it take her.”\n\n“Who?”\n\n“The hiker who came to my lookout this morning. She camped on the mountain. It chased her.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“It was dark and fast.”\n\n“A bear?”\n\n“It wasn’t a bear. It was on fire, or at least hot enough to send vapour into the air. That’s where the smoke came from.”\n\nShe was silent for a few seconds. I willed her to answer, squeezing the radio in my hand.\n\n“Do you see it now?”\n\nI scanned the forest with the binoculars. Nothing, no smoke or dark shapes. I ran back outside to where I had stood when I first saw it. It wasn’t there. In the last of the light the forest was still and silent. The light hung by Rebecca’s tent shone bright. I trained the binoculars on her tent and waited for movement. Nothing. \n\nI lifted the radio to my mouth. “It’s gone.”\n\n“There’s no fire? No smoke?”\n\n“Not anymore.”\n\n“Tom, sometimes rain clouds can funnel in the valley and they can look a lot like smoke. I’ve called in a couple of false sightings.”\n\n“There was something out there.”\n\nIn my mind there was now no doubt. The thing that I saw roaming around the forest was the same thing that came to me the night before and banged on the door to the outhouse. It was the warmth I could feel through the door. \n\n“There are bear sightings up here every summer.”\n\n“It wasn’t a bear. It was the creature Roger told me not to worry about. It took her. Is Roger there?”\n\n“I don’t think so. It’s getting dark. Get back inside.”\n\nIn the growing gloom the fireplace inside the lookout burned red hot. I dragged my feet inside, dejected and overcome with a feeling of helplessness. \n\n“Should I call it in?” I asked into the radio.\n\n“There’s no fire to call in.”\n\n“And the creature?”\n\n“There’s nothing they can do in the dark. Wait until morning. We might hear from Roger. And you never know, you might see her out by the tent cooking breakfast.”\n\n“This is a damn nightmare.”\n\nI put the radio down. Outside the black of night closed in. There was nothing for it now but to wait it out until light. \n\nI stoked the fire and prepared a plate of food. The task provided a temporary distraction. Roger had said that I should not worry. He had also said that nothing could get inside the lookout. That they had to be invited in. How did he know that was true? Had this thing come to him before he went missing?  \n\nI resolved to hike down the mountain first thing in the morning. I would radio the station and tell them that I was sick or injured and needed to come down. Hell I might even tell them the truth, that I was scared. That there were things out here I did not want to mess with.\n\nRebecca had hiked up from that direction and she had made it. But then it had found her, and then it attacked. She had not invited that thing into her campsite and it had come anyway. Would I even make it back to the Ranger Station? I had half a day of hiking to get there. There was every chance I would not make it down.\n\nMy shoulders dropped as the realisation set in. I was a prisoner inside the glass walls of the lookout. The safest option was to stay put inside and keep the doors locked. I had come up here, in part, for the freedom and the open spaces. Now I was unable to leave or to go outside to collect wood or to take a shit. When light came I would have a view for miles in all directions and yet I would be confined to this tiny box.\n\nRoger had asked for time. But how much time? How long did he expect me to remain a prisoner in the lookout he abandoned? He said that there were forces at work in the forest. He had singled out the woman in the blue dress. But it had not been her who rampaged through the forest leaving smoke in her wake. Martina had said to trust Roger, but could I trust Martina?\n\nI ate less than half the pasta and put the leftovers in the fridge. By now it was full dark outside and I lay down on the bed and watched the fire. The heat dried my eyes until it felt like I had sandpaper under my eyelids. I let them stay closed. I was tired. The nap in the morning had tided me over for a while, but now I was flagging again.\n\nThe night was still. The only sound was the crackle of the fireplace. My mind drifted. I wished to be back in the office, with its cliques and drab furniture and my supervisor who used me as a place to unload all his frustration. I hated that place, but at least I knew what to expect. Early mornings and boredom and a middle manager drunk on power, doing his best to cut me down so he could puff out his own chest. He was a grown up version of the bullies who chased me into the toilet stall at school. Hell, I’d even take that toilet stall now over this. \n\nMy head snapped up and I coughed dryly. The once thick log in the fireplace was down to a pile of glowing red embers. I must have dozed off. I got up and put another lump of wood on the fire, if only for the comfort of the light and heat. \n\nThe flickering light from the flames danced on the floor. I watched the window, the grime more obvious under the direct glow. A pebble skipped across the ground somewhere outside. I heard the tick-tick-tick clear as day and caught a flash of movement. I listened for anything else. Nothing.\n\nI lay back down on the bed and stared in horror at the panel of glass next to my bed. The glass was covered in condensation, roughly the height and breadth of a person. I reached out a finger and slid it down the glass. The condensation was on the outside. Something warm had been close to the window. Was it watching as I slept?\n\nMy eyes strained to penetrate the darkness. I scanned the windows in each direction, wishing I had eyes in the back of my head. On the northern side a shadow moved. A dark shape flirted with the light and then retreated back into the night.\n\nI picked up the radio. “Martina? Roger? Is someone there?”\n\nMartina’s voice first. “I’m here Tom.”\n\n“Roger, are you there?”\n\nA pause. “I’m here too.”\n\nI whispered now. “It’s here.”\n\n“The woman?”\n\n“No. The other thing. Tell me what to do.”\n\nRoger sounded worked up. “Are you inside?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Is the door locked?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Stay inside.”\n\n“Should I go out and tell it to leave?”\n\n“No. Stay inside. You’ll be safe there.”\n\n“What is it?”\n\nRoger waited before answering. “Stay inside. It won’t come in.”\n\nA pair of feet the colour of the grey ash of a spent fire flirted with the light at the edge of the peak. They looked almost human, the shape of big boots. I almost fell off the bed. I dropped the radio and it clattered to the floor. The feet took deliberate steps towards the light and then retreated again, as if it knew it would expose itself. Thick grey smoke rose off its skin and into the night. It burned hot. This is what had chased down Rebecca out in the forest.\n\n“Leave me alone.” \n\nMy voice was meek and small. It was the voice of a fifteen year old kid trapped in the bathroom at school, begging for it to end. It hadn’t worked then. \n\nA pair of red eyes glowed like embers in the darkness. They moved around to the northern side of the lookout. It was circling, looking for an opening.\n\nI fumbled for the radio. \n\n“It’s still there.”\n\nNo answer. \n\n“Is anyone there? I need help.”\n\nMartina’s voice. “I’m here Tom.”\n\n“Where is Roger?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\nI almost shouted into the radio. “I’m calling the Station.”\n\n“No Tom. Roger told us not to.”\n\n“Roger isn’t here now is he?”\n\nA shape about the size of a small pot roast tumbled into the light and landed on the deck with a splat. I jumped backwards, afraid to look. My chest tightened and I struggled for breath. \n\nFrom behind and somewhere far off came a guttural howl. The creature stopped, the eyes no longer dancing in the dark. Another cry split the silence of the night, closer this time. The eyes disappeared like headlights switching off. A flurry of stones skipped down the slope. It was on the move.\n\n“Did you hear that?”\n\n“Yes. What was it?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\nOut in the darkness a series of growls, like two animals fighting. It sounded far off. \n\n“I think it ran away. I can hear it fighting with something. I think there are two of them. It threw something before it took off.”\n\nMartina’s response immediate. “What?”\n\n“I’m afraid to look.”\n\n“What is it Tom?”\n\nI stepped over my unpacked bag and stood on my tip toes to get a better look. I was afraid to go near the glass. I took another half-step forwards and the object came into view. The sole of a shoe, of a hiking boot. I recognised it immediately. The same boot Rebecca Hughes was wearing when she visited my lookout. I put my hand to my mouth. A thin band of pale skin ended in a red and bloody mess. Her foot and half her shin were still attached to the shoe. Streaks of charred black cut across the flesh and the boot, as if it had been barbecued on a grill. I almost threw up.\n\n“I’m calling the Station. I have to get out of here.”\n\n“Tom.” It was Roger. “Don’t call the station Tom. You are not in danger.”\n\n“It killed her. It ripped off her leg and left it by my door.”\n\n“If you call the station then a team will come up here and there will be more blood. Do you want that on your conscience?”\n\n“You told me there was nothing to worry about.”\n\n“If you just stay inside and don’t let anything in, there won’t be. I will take care of everything. We are so close to the end Tom.”\n\nThe radio shook in my hand. “If you knew something was out there that could do this, you should have warned me. I could have warned her. She might have lived. I don’t want to be here anymore.”\n\n“It will be over soon. Stay inside.”\n\n [X](https://www.reddit.com/r/SleeplessFromSundown/comments/y3ngzo/welcome_message/)",

        "text": "I arrived at work three days ago. I’m still here. The doors locked from the outside and the staircases are a mindless spiral to nowhere. I have been through a lot and I don’t know how much more of it I can take. Still this place needs to be documented. The public needs to know what happens here. So please bear with me.\n\nI spent the first night huddled in a conference room with a desk jammed against the handle. A small window in the center of the door was my only vantage point into the dark room outside. Shadows played tricks over the water coolers and other crap on the shelves. The lights went out at ten. I guess my mind used sound to fill in the gaps. \n\nThe creaks and groans of an unknown electrical system mixed in with the still unidentifiable female voices that snaked through the pipes. At one point, I heard footsteps. Then two people talking. Then there was a visceral shout so real that it almost got me to break camp and investigate. Then silence. \n\nThe temperature dropped below freezing. I could see my breath. I found some jackets in the back and used them as blankets. It’s an eerie fucking feeling wearing someone else’s clothes. Especially not knowing the owners or their story. The fabric smells like mothballs and the leather stinks like decay. But warmth is warmth and frostbite is the last thing anyone needs to deal with when they’re trapped.\n\nMy cell phone battery died. So that part’s just fucked. This story is coming to you live and uncut from a piece o’ shit Linux from who-the-hell knows when. The keys are sticky and the monitors are covered with a thin layer of dust. But there’s hundreds strewn about. They all still connect to the Internet, albeit very slowly, so might as well put one of them to use. Midas whale, as my old coworker used to say. \n\nAh. That’s the other thing. Jamie was here. \n\nI woke up in the morning to a panicked knock. The commotion pulled me out from my hidey-hole and into the general ‘bullpen’ of the office desks. I looked into the glass hallway and caught our esteemed head of accounting about to put his fist through the divider. He laughed when he saw me. I never liked Jamie. But I can’t tell you the relief of seeing that old rat fucker’s worried wrinkled face. \n\n“Open up.”\n\nI thought he was there to say the prank was over. I thought he would say we’re going home. I ran over and pulled open the door like a host at a party. He collapsed at my feet in a heap. There were scratches on his face. Blood decorated his blazer. I pulled up a rolling chair and helped him sit down. I tried to speak before he cut me off. \n\n“How long have you been here?” he asked. \n\n“Two days.” I answered. \n\n“Did you take the tunnel?”\n\nThe question made me mad. This man made more money in a day than most did in months. He needed the shortcut? In his sixty thousand dollar car? With the heat blaring, the gas tank full, and two ten dollar mocha-motherfucker double fisting both cup holders? I digress.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Yeah. Me too.”\n\nI disappeared into the men’s room to find some gauze. Our old office kept bandages along with mouthwash and other common toiletries. This one was the same. I came back and found Jamie splayed across a desk with a pant leg rolled to the top. A long gash slipped down from his thigh to his calf. He grabbed the gauze out of my hand and gingerly dabbed at the wound.\n\n“Did you come in through the pool?”\n\nThe thought did occur that this could be a test. Another part of the prank. Something set up by the building or the sick fucking things who ran this little mind game. I didn’t like the barrage of questions or the rushed way in which he asked. I didn’t like anything about him. I think he sensed it.\n\n“I’m sorry, we have to trust each other, son.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because it’s us against them.”\n\n“Who?”\n\n“The thing you saw in the pool.”\n\nI found it hard to argue with that point. I let my guard down after a while. I showed him the conference room. I told him about the jackets and the women crying and the windows to nowhere. He told me about the Station.\n\n“Capital S if you want to write it down.”\n\nAccording to Jamie, the Station is a long tunnel with a number of different chutes lined up along both sides. Think of it like Grand Central with dumbwaiters instead of trains. Each terminal can take you to a different place. Some of them lead to different parts of the Office. Some of them lead home. Some of them lead Down. \n\n“Picking is a gamble. There’s nothing to distinguish the chutes. They’re all identical. You just have to jump into the one that looks like home and hope for the best. That’s it.”\n\nJamie has made it to the Station on three separate occasions. His most recent trip sent him here. \n\n“Right at the Goddamn beginning.” \n\nWe spent the day trading stories. I didn’t have much to offer. Jamie did. He claimed to have been stuck in the office for almost two full weeks. He spoke about demons and entities and bugs and termites and predators. He opined often about another guy, a maintenance worker named Emanuele, and how they got separated upstairs. He hoped he was still okay.\n\n“The tunnels in the Big Room,” he grunted. “Avoid those fucking tunnels.”\n\nI nodded like that was something which made sense. I didn’t necessarily believe him. The entire day felt like a fucked up fever dream. I think it just felt good to talk to somebody else about it. \n\n“Where do you think we are?” I asked at one point. “What is this place?”\n\n“Hell,” he answered without missing a beat. “But I’m still holding out hope for purgatory.”\n\n“Hell wouldn’t have such a clean carpet.”\n\n“The snacks aren’t bad either.”\n\nWe got the idea to try and build out some defenses for the upcoming night. The lock in my conference room would help, but might not be enough for the patrollers, according to Jamie. We needed something sturdier. I took my new friend to the back offices. We explored for a while until we found a particularly off the path private office which connected to a bathroom. \n\n“Double locks,” Jamie approved. “Better to have a fail safe.”\n\nThe lights dimmed at their usual time. We gathered chips and water bottles and hatched a plan in the glow of computer monitors. I wanted to find a way out right then. Jamie wanted to wait.\n\n“You don’t want to travel at night,” he insisted with a hand on my shoulder. “They eat at night.”\n\nWe agreed to take shifts. I would take first lookout while Jamie slept in the bathroom behind a double lock. I brought over my makeshift bed from the other night while he got comfortable. Jamie looked exhausted. The circles under his eyes had circles. I think this must have been his first real shuteye in a while.\n\n“Wake me when you need it,” he offered. “Don’t be a hero.”\n\nThe lights cut at ten. He fell asleep soon after. I stayed vigilant at the desk post. We kept the shades drawn. I didn’t risk looking outside. There was some movement. A chair fell over. The pipes vibrated with the rush of fresh water. But nothing else happened. \n\nI woke Jamie a few hours later. I let him know of the developments. He thanked me and told me to use the jackets as a pillow. I laughed and asked if he fluffed it for me. Then I went to bed. I don’t know for how long.\n\n‘\n\nI woke up to a ringing in my ears. The bathroom door was unlocked. The private office outside was silent. The ringing pulsated until it slowly faded away altogether. A bird call took its place. \n\nI got up and rubbed my eyes a bit. I still couldn’t see straight with old contacts. I pushed back the door. A shape was standing on the desk. I could tell right away that something wasn’t right. The shape was looking back at me. It didn’t move. We stayed that way in silence for a second. \n\nIt was Jamie. And he wasn’t wearing any pants.\n\n“Whoa. What are you doing man?”\n\nHe stared at me in the dark a little while longer. He was an old man with wrinkles and nakedness did not do him any favors. He got down from the table slowly. He put his clothes back on, one button at a time, and smiled. I backed away into the exit. \n\n“Relax,” he laughed. “Come over here little buddy.”\n\nI turned at the handle and felt it stick. \n\n“What are you doing?” I repeated.\n\n“Nothing.”\n\nMy heart stopped in my chest. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t move. \n\n“You can trust me,” he advanced. “Remember?”\n\n“Okay,” I retreated. “Where are your clothes?”\n\n“I didn’t want to get them dirty,” he answered. “Or wet.”\n\nHis eyes flecked with color.\n\n“You’re not Jamie,” I offered. “Are you?”\n\nThe silence hung in the air like a bad smell. I kicked at the door. Jamie waited. I kicked harder. He looked hurt. Like actually offended. I actually thought maybe my paranoia got the best of me. \n\n“I told you,” he giggled. “They only eat at night.”\n\nHis jaw unhitched. The door unclicked.\n\nI ran.\n\n‘\n\nI’m safe now. Still stuck, but safe. I won’t say where. I think it might be better that way. The computers could be bugged. The cameras could be recording. My plan is still to get to the Station. I don’t know if it’s real or if I’m dead or if anyone is even able to read my rant into this old ass workstation. \n\nBut if you are - \n\n\nPlease know that the executives at White Valley International are responsible for holding people here. I don’t know how many. There could be dozens of us. Hundreds. I don’t fucking know. This place is an enormous cavern with no easy way out. I am located at the Follaton City branch. I have a family in nearby Sillica. My dad’s last name is **********. Please let him know I’m okay.\n\nThe Executive floor is three levels up. I have to go through them to get home. There’s smoke in the hallway. Someone up there will not stop screaming. The voices are getting louder - angrier, more excited even. There’s a rhythm to it, almost like a chant, and I think something is happening. I think I’m running out of time. I have to try. I won’t survive another night.\n\nIf you don’t hear from me, well, by now you know why.\n\nI’m sorry, Dad. I love you so much.\n\nGoodbye.",

        "text": "Aw, the Pottsville Annual Easter Egg Hunt of 1980...\n\nI can still remember it like it was yesterday.\n\nAt the time, I was nine years old.\n\nLike other kids, my age was very excited about the upcoming Easter Egg Hunt.\n\nThat year, I was determined to collect the most eggs and beat Susie Jenkins' previous record.\n\nAnyway, Pottsville was a small town with a population of 10,000. \n\nIt was your typical midwestern town much like Mayberry, where everybody knew each other and had just enough amenities to live.\n\nFor about a hundred years or so, Pottsville had been holding its annual Easter Egg Hunt which was often followed by the community potluck.\n\nI always looked forward to the community potluck too.\n\nAnyway, I remembered that day the town square was packed but you could tell that everybody was on edge.\n\nYou see, about a month earlier, a giant meteor had landed on old man Johnson's egg farm. \n\nAfter the meteor landed, it caused a huge explosion that was felt throughout the neighboring counties.\n\nI could hear the grown-ups talking about the giant meteor since it was the biggest thing to happen in Pottsville since the great train wreck of 1945.\n\nOf course, several experts from the nearby university were called into town.\n\nThe meteor was said to have been the size of a car but that could have been an exaggeration on their part.\n\nAll this talk about meteors was boring to me and besides, it was almost time for the Easter Egg Hunt to begin.\n\nSoon the subject of the meteor was forgotten, only to be replaced with thoughts of the upcoming hunt.\n\nAll I could think about now was how many eggs I could find...\n\nLuckily, I spotted my first egg five minutes into the hunt.\n\nSomething was weird about this egg though.\n\nInstead of your standard dyed egg, this one was black reminding me of the eggs in the movie, \"Alien\".\n\nAnyway, I stared at it in awe and could feel something moving inside it causing me to drop the strange-looking egg.\n\nAt this point, the egg was beginning to crack.\n\nAn awful smell like sulfur, escaped from the egg almost causing me to pass out.\n\nAs I steadied myself\n\n I could hear 8-year-old Mary Murphy who was nearby, let out a shriek.\n\nSoon the whole park was filled with screaming kids and frantic parents as, all of the Easter Eggs began to burst open revealing what I could only describe as grotesque-looking rats.\n\nWith some of the creatures having multiple eyes and legs.\n\nNot long after the chaos began to brew, the creatures began attacking all the people in the park.\n\nThose of us who managed to escape ran to the nearby church for refuge.\n\nOnce inside the church, Father Miller immediately locked the door.\n\n\"We should be safe in here for now,\" he said.\n\nThe church was filled with concerned parents and sobbing children, including me.\n\n\"Okay folks, we need to calm down and figure out what those things are,\"  Father Miller said.\n\n\"Who are you telling to calm down!\" Old man Daniels shouted.\n\n\"I understand your concerns but let's be rational here.\"\n\nJust then, one of the windows shattered as one of the creatures tried to make its way inside spraying glass everywhere.\n\n\"Quick, follow me!\" Father Miller shouted.\n\nWe all followed him into the church's basement.\n\nOnce everybody was safe inside, he slammed the door shut and then locked it.\n\nIt was one of those vaulted doors, so we were safe.\n\nAll of the women and children, including myself began to cry.\n\nYou could hear the creatures from above, scurrying around.\n\nAt this point, we were all on edge.\n\nSo when we heard gunfire off in the distance, we began to cheer.\n\nHelp was finally here.\n\nIn the days that followed, the surviving citizens of Pottsville were placed under quarantine but soon the incident was forgotten and nearly forty-three years have passed...\n\nLast night though at approximately 9 PM, a huge meteor landed on the Johnson Egg farm...\n\nThe annual Easter Egg Hunt is in 3 weeks so, I'll just wait and see what happens...",

        "text": "  For a moment, all was still, and I lay silently, basking in the tranquillity of the morning. Sunlight streamed into the room, diffusing through the curtains and casting a soft glow on the empty pillow beside me. Minute patches of dust danced in front of my face, the light catching them as they spiralled toward the carpet. The sweet, melodic sound of birdsong found its way through the open window to greet my ears, and before the last foggy tendrils of sleep cleared themselves from my head, I was blissfully unaware.\n\nThen the pain hit, crashing through my head like a tidal wave, destroying any delusion of peace. Every nerve was on fire, a roaring, raging inferno that ripped through my skull, leaving me helpless, clutching at the sheets with desperate hands, rivulets of perspiration tracing the contours of my face. I clamped my lips together, forcing down the bile that rose in my throat as the pain built to an agonising crescendo. It was as though the sun was inside my head, blinding my brain, burning me from the inside out. I screwed my eyelids shut and rode out the tsunami, waiting until it had subsided to a dull throb lapping against the back of my eyes before dragging myself out from under the duvet and staggering to the bathroom door. Somehow I made it to the shower, turning the heat down in the hope that the cool water would clear the haze from my mind and soothe my aching body. I bent down to pick up a bar of soap, and the sudden movement was enough to tip me over the edge. Fumbling blindly behind me for the shower knob, I ripped back the curtain, almost tearing it from its rail, and slid across the floor to violently empty my stomach into the toilet. I fought to repress the nausea as I wiped soap from my eyes, gripping the sides of the bowl for support as I heaved again. A choking sob escaped my lips, quickly stifled as I heard the soft click of the door to the spare room shutting and footsteps padding down the stairs. Retching, I bowed my head, hearing the familiar sounds of my wife as she began to prepare breakfast. *My wife. Can I call her that anymore? Am I worthy of that?*\n\nStretching out a trembling hand to pull the chain, I let the sound of the rushing cascade of water drown out the cry that wrenched itself from within me. I collapsed backwards into the corner of the bathroom, leaning my head against the wall as a solitary tear carved a path down my cheek.\n\n*I can’t do this. I can’t live like this. No, this isn’t living, this is merely existing. I just want to feel something. To feel happy, even angry; anything but this numbing emptiness and the dull ache that smothers all sensation. I used to feel such vibrant passion for my life – my job, my family, the invigorating embrace of fresh coffee in the morning. But somewhere along the line my foot slipped and I lost it all. When the cracks appeared I painted over them, ignoring the walls as they crumbled around me, desperately trying to convince myself that sand was as secure as mortar. And for a while, I managed. But sand washes away, and when the rain came it slipped through my fingers, leaving me cold and lonely, trapped within ruins of my own creation*.\n\nI raised my weary head from my hands, pressing salty palms to my eyes in a futile attempt to stem the flow of tears that fell. I dragged myself to my feet, pulling on yesterday’s crumpled clothes and not bothering to wash the last of the shampoo from my hair. I caught a glimpse of my swollen face in the mirror above the sink and turned away, disgusted by the darkness circling my eyes and the mottled shadow along my jaw that I couldn’t muster the energy to remove. I reached for the door handle, clumsy fingers meeting cold metal as my scattered thoughts willed my body to obey my commands. Silently pleading with the spinning walls, I stumbled out onto the landing, squinting into the light.\n\nHaving made my way down the stairs, I hesitated in the entrance to the kitchen, pausing to lean my head against the smooth wood of the doorframe and watch Amelia as she made breakfast. I smiled sadly, remembering days when I would join her there and we would laugh together, my wife scolding me as I stole bacon from the frying pan, our daughter giggling at us both from her wheelchair as her hazel eyes sparkled. Amelia was so beautiful then. She still is now, but filtered through a dull, heavy sheen of unkept promises and late nights alone.\n\nAs if sensing my presence, Amelia turned, barely able to hide her disappointment at my bedraggled appearance. With quiet resignation in her deep brown eyes she looked away from me, pressing her lips together to hold back the tears that threatened to spill over. Wordlessly, without even a glance in my direction, she gestured for me to sit at the table, placing a plate of toast, a glass of water, and four small white tablets in front of me, flinching when her arm brushed mine. *Even the though of me causes her pain.* I took a tentative mouthful of the toast, wincing as it scraped its way down my throat. Setting it aside, I picked up the two aspirin tablets and gulped them down before warily regarding the remaining pills. I felt Amelia’s stare boring into the top of my head and gingerly reached for the fluoxetine, glancing up at her. She broke the eye contact immediately, flushing red as though ashamed to be caught so obviously distrusting me. *I hate myself for what I’m doing to her, but she doesn’t understand. The medication takes away what little control I have left, and I’d rather be broken than with nothing left to break.* I slipped the tablets into my pocket where they rattled gently against those from yesterday, and the day before, and the day before that.\n\nI pushed my chair back from the table, and we both baulked at the harsh grinding sound of wood on tile which shattered the thick silence. I stood, crossing to the fridge. *I just need some milk. My throat hurts. I need some milk from the fridge to soothe it. In the door of the fridge, that’s where it will be. Just milk.* I extended shaking fingers toward the fridge door, feeling Amelia’s judging gaze on me again. As I touched the handle, a hard cold lump formed in my stomach and I felt beads of sweat break out across my forehead, betraying my fear. *Just milk.* The door swung open and I froze, staring uncomprehendingly at the space where it had been. My eyes flew to Amelia, hoping to find reassurance, but she covered he mouth with her hand and hurried from the room\n\n*No.*\n\n*I need it. The milk.*\n\nI was suddenly dizzy. My heart pounded and the kitchen blurred in and out of focus. I could taste it, the flavour of oblivion, sliding down my throat, diminishing my unquenchable thirst. I could feel it, fire in my veins, thick black smoke both clouding and clarifying my mind, enveloping reality and taking me someplace else, somewhere better. I needed it.\n\n*I need it.*\n\nSeconds later, maybe hours, I didn’t know; time had lost its meaning, I found myself sitting slumped in my car. I shifted into gear, driving with no purpose and no destination in mind, just needing to get away from it all. I drove on autopilot, knuckles white against the steering wheel, lungfuls of air forcing themselves through my nose. My mind was swerving wildly, thoughts careering round the corners, and try as I might I couldn’t apply the brakes. I was stuck in the wrong gear and rapidly losing control.\n\nRealisation hit me like an avalanche. I knew exactly where I was. The peeling paint and faded sign in the window were more familiar to me than my own home. *Don’t go in. Keep driving, you fool*. The bell tinkled as I opened the door, the sound greeting me like the intoxicating song of Sirens, luring me in. Each step I took echoed round the room, magnified by the glass army that lined the shelves. My last shred of resolve crumbled to dust and I lurched forward, gripping the counter as every cell in my body screamed out for relief. I could hear each beat of my heart reverberating round my chest, increasing in pace and volume until I gasped for air and bent over, trying to alleviate the searing pain in my lungs. The counter blurred before my eyes and blackness crept into the corners of my vision. I felt lightheaded. I felt nauseous. My tongue thick like sandpaper in my parched mouth.\n\nThere were words. Someone was talking to me, calling my name, panic in their voice. I straightened abruptly and, throwing my money on the polished wood, I took what I needed and walked out, the Siren’s lullaby ringing in my ears once again.\n\nI laid it on the seat beside me, the poison I had forged my alliance with. I glanced over at my faithful friend, the one that had been there when no one else could be. The one I had always turned to, no matter how hard I tried to find a more trustworthy escape. *Not yet. Not here.* I turned the key in the ignition, my heart sinking when the engine sputtered and failed to start. *This damn car. Amelia will be glad to be rid of it. Two pieces of junk gone together.* After five attempts, the car finally started and I pulled out into the flow of traffic, oblivious to the cacophony of car horns and squealing tires that sounded behind me. I drove until the dam was breached and the flood of yearning threatened to overwhelm me, and then I stopped.\n\n*I can’t do this. I’m not strong enough. I’m just a broken man, unemployed, with a wife who’s repulsed by the very sight of me and a daughter who I cursed to never walk, never speak, never understand my absence and my cold words and the bitter stench of my breath as I leave her time and time again. Never understand that she iss perfect and the problem is me, that I’m not worthy of loving her and being loved by her. As I am, this wreck tossed carelessly onto the shore, they don’t need me. They’d be better off…*\n\nThe cool liquid burned like fire, the invigorating venom surging through my veins, making me feel – momentarily – alive. I was drowning in it, unable to stop, choking and gasping for air but needing the alcohol more than oxygen. My stomach turned, vomit splashing onto my shoes but still I tipped the bottle back, drinking it dry and then reaching for the next. I drunk myself into the abyss and washed all thoughts away. My head was empty, so empty, yet for the first time in months I knew exactly what to do.\n\nMy foot found its way to the pedal and my hand to the gearstick and suddenly I was moving again, but this time with intention and a destination in mind. The kiss of glass never left my lips as I passed a flash of red, recognising far too late that it was a traffic light. I couldn’t find it in myself to care. Upon reaching the cliff-top pass I slowed to a halt in the middle of the road. I could see it; the long, empty stretch of asphalt laid invitingly before me, and at the end, that sharp corner and the cliff beyond.\n\n*Don’t hesitate. Don’t think of them. Or do. Think of Amelia, sobbing in the hospital as bad news crashed over her like waves. Think of how you left then, seeking the company of darkness because light revealed truth, and you couldn’t face it. You tried after that, for a few years at least. But don’t cut yourself any slack; think of the work trips away, you coward, conveniently coinciding with birthdays and anniversaries and doctor’s appointments. Think of how the lies stretched on as the absences continued long after you’d been fired, unable to celebrate first smiles and promotions and healthy, happy babies born to healthy, happy friends for fear of having to face the devastation that would follow. Because feeling something, meant feeling everything. Light only exists in the context of darkness and you have so much of that, a deep, shadowy stain that you smear on everyone you touch. Not anymore.*\n\nI emptied the last drops from the bottle down my shirt.\n\nThe car jolted forward.\n\n*It’s a long road.*\n\nI accelerated.\n\n*The spot with no barrier is just before the corner.*\n\nThe car sped up, meandering across the road as I fought to keep it straight.\n\n*Hardly anyone comes out this way.*\n\nHalfway there.\n\n*156 metres…straight down.*\n\nNearly there now.\n\n*Breathe in.*\n\nI glimpsed it then, a familiar silver brick facing the opposite way to me, two pale faces a flash behind glass. I willed myself to brake, but somewhere between my alcohol drenched brain and the muscles in my foot the message got lost and my body refused to listen. I screamed silently, terror flooding my thoughts and paralysing my body as my sluggish mind slowly became aware of the inevitable. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t think. Time was dragged reluctantly through treacle. I could only sit there, my hands useless on the wheel as I came ever closer to the car on the other side of the road. At the last second, facing the car almost head on as I teetered on the brink of consciousness, my eyes locked with those of the hazy passenger in the front and I saw the beginnings of a smile as joyful recognition dawned in her eyes.\n\nThe world was spinning. Spinning on its axis, turning around the sun, and tumbling over and over until it merged into a single blurred line, punctuated by the flicker of flames and the screams of metal grinding against metal. Piercing, shrieking, agonised screams, and still the world spun. Day revolved into night just as consciousness flowed into something deeper and darker. As glass fell like raindrops, caressing skin and asphalt alike, night-time descended, the blood streaked sunset fading away, silence and stillness rising to take its place. The world kept on spinning, cold and uncaring, moving on and leaving devastation in its wake.\n\nAt 7:08 this evening, I opened my eyes.\n\nFor a moment, all was still, and I lay silently, basking in the tranquillity of the evening. I was comfortable, cocooned in my bed of twisted metal, moulded perfectly to the contours of my body. A few metres away another bed stood in the soft moonlight, silver in colour and seamlessly flowing into the ground. Suitcases, clothes and toys lay scattered around, a beautiful little bedroom for a mother and daughter. Eyes stared unseeingly at me from this resting place. They looked so at peace, finally free from the shackles of pretence, no longer needing to hide the depths of sorrow and grief. One deep brown set that would never again know betrayal, never again plead and beg through tears, never again sink into that hollow, defeated look they’d held for years. The other set was an intense hazel, set in a small face with a perfectly preserved look of joyful surprise. Never again would they feel the sharp sting of rejection, the pain of unrequited love. Never again would they fill with confusion and fear as their misguided trust was thrown callously back at their innocent owner. Never again.\n\nAt 7:10 this evening, I closed my eyes.",

        "text": "The sun rose over a trailer on the edge of a farm in the Netherlands. It was small, but fashionably expensive looking. I laid in the bed as still I could. I had woken up with a not-so-insignificant amount of dread. \n\n\"Ding!\" Not a single muscle twitched at the notification's sound. It was unfamiliar. It wasn't the email ding. It wasn't the news ding. It was probably the messenger ding. Who would message me there? No one that I could think of. Who would message me at all? No one that I could think of.\n\nThe curiosity took over. I reached over the edge of the bed and slapped my hand around until it found the cool edge of the screen. My year-long backpacking trip was coming to an end, and it was Taylor that I had met at the start in New Zealand. More curious, I opened it up. \"Hey Lee! I hope everything is going great. I hope you have fun in Europe!\"\n\nI hadn't expected to ever hear from her again. We didn't part on good terms. I re-read the message to extract any subtle meaning from her word choice. \n\n\"Ding!\" Another notification interrupts while re-reading the message. The box drops down from the top of the screen to show \"Dave: Waddup! I hope you have fun in Europe\". Confused, I stared blankly at the message until it disappears. My phone has had service since I had heard my email notifications earlier. I met Dave in Vietnam 6 months after Taylor. I don't think they would know each other.\n\n\"Ding!\" While considering the possibilities, another notification appears. It was from Katie that I met in Sydney. Another well-wishing for Europe. Before the notification disappears, \"Ding!\", \"Ding!\", \"Ding!\". The boxes layered on top of each other and disappeared one by one revealing the same message over and over again from more strangers met in passing on my trip.\n\nOverwhelmed by confusion, I dropped my phone over the edge of the bed. I laid still again, but I was awake now. \"Is this what it's like to be loved?\" I said out loud to myself and laughed harder than I should have. I need to find a better way top cope. I picked up my phone and checked the notifications again. I rarely get messages. Making friends is not my strength. Towards the end of my time with these people, I wouldn't describe their vibe as friendly towards me.\n\n4 emails and two messages received. All saying the same thing within a 1 minute window. The timestamps all reflected that window, so the phone didn't suddenly gain service. We didn't take pictures together. I don't have any social media that they could connect with each other on. It doesn't make sense. \n\nIn fact, while in Sydney with Katie, I was interviewing for a job and excited about it. She moved onto Indonesia before I was done with the interviews. I had mentioned that I could go on, but it felt off.\n\nI gave up on the puzzle and put the phone down.\n\nToday was the day that I planned to get more serious. The trip had been fun. Unforgettably fun. I needed to work on settling into a new life in San Francisco. Resumes. Studying. Job interviews. Today, I headed to Germany for the last leg of my tour, then a long layover in London, and then it would be over. \n\nThinking about it, I felt more dread. I opened reddit for a distraction. I saw a cat picture that made me smile. I skipped an apocalyptic political article and a police shooting another innocent black man. The next link said \"Young Man Enters Home and Stabs 3 People to death\". I opened it up. A self-described incel killed 3 sorority girls. He was angry about being lonely.\n\nI laughed out loud at the insanity. I could never understand people like that. Throwing their life away and other's lives as well. You can always just walk away. Better yourself. Give up on romance and indulge in good food, books, video games, and anything else that makes you happy. Being dead is pointless. I re-read the article while giggling at the absurdity and stupidity. It sounded fake with how everything lined up with a dark corner of the internet's reality.\n\n\"Ding!\". Another message from Dave, \"Hahahahahahahah\". I paused. A feeling of insecurity washes over me. I was laughing at an article detailing how 4 people died in a violent mass murder. I rationalized that it was another bad coping mechanism. In my past, I have had many people mock me for being a school shooter and/or serial killer, but I was just awkward and bad at social situations. The coping mechanism used humor as a way to separate myself from what people have accused me of. I didn't endorse the violence. I laughed at the insanity of their reasoning not at the death or pain of others. \n\nI wasn't going to post a comment, but even as a hardcore lurker, I felt like I should explain myself. Explain myself to who? I looked at the timestamps. 15 minutes since his last message. The connection between well wishing and his laughter was not immediately obvious to me. The creeps that I felt prevented me from messaging him. \n\nIn the last moments with Dave outside the hostel, I was heading to do a hike on a dangerous trail in Vietnam. It was beautiful, but also covered in landmines and remnants of agent orange.  He was saying goodbye in a tone that was more patronizing than sincere. He \"hoped\" that I didn't die. He \"hoped\" that I would be safe. He \"hoped\" that I made it back in one complete piece. The more unnecessary hope that he had left me with more unease and certainty that there was more to his comments than \"hope\". \n\nI laid in bed and mulled the possibilities. As a software engineer, I felt confident that it wasn't a network anomaly. It could be a lottery winning coincidence, but I hoped that I could win a cooler lottery than this. The mind wandered further.\n\nA memory came up that I liked to keep as repressed as possible. A memory of my controlling and manipulative ex-girlfriend from college. She was angry. We were fighting, and she was upset again at some minor disrespect that had snowballed into a huge issue from how I responded. She was out for blood and had been insulting me in anyway she could. My voice. My hobbies. My opinions. My history. Insulting anything and everything that she could say. I had been reacting with a stonewall of silence in order to not provoke her further.\n\nShe started bragging that her family had deep connections to the Secret Service. I hear her words again as clear as day \"Anywhere you go, I will find you. When you are happy, I'll be right there. When you fall in love, I will be there.  You will never be free. You don't deserve happiness, and I will make sure that you never get it.\" \n\nI closed my eyes and rubbed my face. It was too early in the morning for this. I had a new life to start in San Francisco. I need to get to work.",

Patterns repeat, and the musical instrument's partnering written words at the museum will reveal extremely unlikely sentences that match in subjects and details with today's current facts. A claim like this wouldn't be taken seriously, so I won't be trying to convince anyone, until the day I find which museum in South Korea it is displayed at, and come to prove to people that what you called \"paranormal\" or \"supernatural\" were varied versions of a natural condition enacted by quantum physics, such as consciousness, rules of physics, and information such as pain, music, and taste. Now, you're probably thinking of \"God\", and consumptions, evolution, and death. You most likely also believe or dislike the current mainstay themes of what you call religion and deities. Atheists are also wrong. I assert that his crucifixion does not help sins, and that our god isn't the evil tyrant portrayed in their version of the Bible. The Quran did not deny that he was, because the Surah's quote says \"...it was made to appear as if he died.\" This obviously implies that satanists have infiltrated and stood as leaders of religions, internationally, for centuries, if not millennia, by generational \"elections\". If a person wrote a creepy pasta about child trafficking monster type people whose religion is of torture and evil sacrifice, akin to vampirism, kept consistent throughout their name changes, and that their lineages are the most financially affluent, scattered in conglomerate control groups over the planet, acting as rulers, owners, executive directors of public and private institutes such as governmental entities, academia, banking, businesses, food production regulators, and religions, you have today's world as it is. Cultists form groups within insider clubs, and branch out using clever schemes and systems. Epstein and Ghislaine's case being ruled as guilty but with lack of name reveals, after Hunter Biden's laptop was confiscated and kept in the dark, (believed to contain links of guilt among powerful public figures who were part of the cult and its \"usual activities\" involving psychopathic violent pedophilia, \\[distinctly different from feeling attraction to a teen\\]) substantiates the viability that these events occurred. My musical instrument has a famous musician of today's time's music recorded in it, the way a vintage record player had vibration-carved lines engraved into a plastic or vinyl disc for replay. I am not supposed to credit Thomas Edison for it, because he took inspiration and credit from another inventor of his time and region. Mine was deliberately kept as a secret, not because nobody should know, but, because different scenarios affect future choices drastically. Irrefutable evidence of reincarnation and deeper mind's synchronized influence to surrounding reality will be displayed to the public, using music and decoding. Others have viewed its \"glass\" and \"ropes\" for hundreds of years. This will aid humanity in reaching a higher level of understanding, similar to knowing about vitamin C preventing scurvy.",

        "text": "Do you ever wonder why they keep the lights on in a lot of apartment hallways all night? You might think it's a kind of courtesy to the tenants, you know coming home late at night a bit tipsy, it's nice not to have to stumble through the way to your door.\n\n\nBut think about that. Landlords, as a breed of humans, are generally some of the cheapest bastards you'll ever know. Just try to get a shutter replaced, or the hot water valve fixed, and you'll understand the weeks-long battle you have to go through for every minor repair. You might think, especially how now everyone has a flashlight on their phone, and a phone in everyone's pocket, that landlords would start saving some money by turning off the lights.\n\n\nBut there they are: lights on in most every apartment complex, condo, hotel, and fleabag motel across the world. The light might be sickly, fluorescent and buzzing, or sliding through the corners of your front door from the outside. But it's on.\n\n\nYou have to remember that temporary living places are naturally on the tilted, thin side when it comes to the material universe. I'm not just talking the natural echoes every place gets when a soul has been there for a bit. That's natural enough, and can even be cozy. They happen when a place is touched by a human, connected to us, made real in a way.\n\n\nThe hallways in and outside most apartments were designed for a different reason. They are designed to not be places, to be empty canvases for people to pass through, faceless, on their own journeys. No marks on the walls to show how big the kids have grown. No family photos. Knicks and scratches are made by strangers, and patched up quickly.\n\n\nA non-place like that wasn't really meant for people. And so the not-people come to stay. \n\n\nYou might think this is crazy. But think for a second: do you remember what the color of the flooring is outside your apartment? Really remember the color of the walls or siding? The brain filters out a lot of stuff. Like the shadows that move in the corners of the hallways, in the light that steals in from the front door. \n\n\nThat's where the lights come in. It's the last bastion of a place being for humans. If the lights are on, it stands to reason somebody's home. Everybody knows that. \n\n\nBut the question becomes, what happens if the lights are turned off, and the hallways truly become a non-space? It happens, occasionally, in cheaper housing projects. And sure, maybe you have to be a little crazy after a while, living in a cheap apartment, where you're never sure if the locks will hold, and the mirrors are all scratched, and the lights go out deep in the night. \n\n\nMaybe you have to be a little crazy, hearing the things that shuffle, their movements just at the lowest frequency of human hearing. \n\n\nBe glad the lights are on outside your apartment. And don't spend too long staring at the light beneath the door. Remember that you are home, right? In the space you own. \n\n  For now. ",

        "text": "This whole... fiasco... started on a pretty normal day, just like any other. I woke up, got dressed, and headed out for work. I decided to take the bus that morning since I had accidentally slept in a little and I was already running later than I would've liked. As I boarded the bus and showed the driver my ticket, I noticed something strange out of the corner of my eye. It was a figure, lurking in the back of the grimy bus, watching me with dark, unblinking eyes. I couldn't make out any features, but I could feel its gaze boring into me, making my skin crawl. I glanced in its direction, still about 37% asleep, but I saw nothing other than a few other people, mostly glued to their phones.\n\nI quickly shook off the feeling. I had stayed up pretty late the night before having an impromptu horror movie marathon, so it was entirely possible that the combination of a lack of sleep plus the horror movies from the night before was having lingering effects.\n\nAt first it seemed like it was just a case of my own mind working against me, but the figure seemed to follow me wherever I went. It was always there, just out of sight, watching and waiting. After a while I honestly started to feel like I was losing my mind.\n\nOne night, I was alone in my apartment, trying to relax after a long day. But as I was lying in bed, I heard a strange noise coming from the corner of the room. It was a low, guttural growl, like something out of a nightmare. I sat up, my heart pounding in my chest, and saw the figure standing in the shadows.\n\nI couldn't move, couldn't speak. All I could do was stare, frozen in terror. The figure stepped forward, revealing its true form. It was a creature, with long, bony claws and skin as black as coal. Its eyes glowed with an otherworldly crimson light, and its mouth twisted into a sinister grin, revealing rows of elongated teeth far too sharp to be human.\n\nI tried to scream, but no sound came out. The creature approached me, its claws reaching out to touch my face. I closed my eyes, waiting for the worst, but then something strange happened. The creature's touch was gentle, almost comforting. In a hoarse voice which seemed to echo through my mind, it whispered something in my ear in a language I couldn't understand, but its tone was oddly soothing, almost maternal.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes again, the creature was gone. I was alone in my room, but I could still feel its presence, like a warm, protective aura.\n\nThe encounter with the creature left me shaken and confused. I couldn't explain what had happened or why the creature had seemed so threatening at first, only to become comforting in the end. But as the days went by, I started to notice changes in myself.\n\nI began to have vivid dreams, filled with strange, otherworldly landscapes and creatures that I couldn't even begin to describe. In these dreams, I felt like I was being guided by a presence that was both ancient and powerful. And when I woke up, I felt more rested and energized than ever before.\n\nAt first, I was afraid of these dreams, but then I started to look forward to them. I felt like I was being shown something important, something that could change my life forever. And as the dreams continued, I began to understand what the creature had whispered to me that night.\n\nIt was a message of hope, of power, and of transformation. The creature had shown me a path that I could follow, a way to tap into the hidden potential within myself. And as I took my first steps down that path, I felt a sense of purpose that I had never felt before.\n\nAs the days turned into weeks, and then into months, I became increasingly obsessed with the creature and the dreams it had shown me. I couldn't stop thinking about it, couldn't let go of the feeling of power and transformation that it had left within me.\n\nAt first, I tried to keep my obsession under control. I continued to go about my daily life, going to work, seeing friends, and trying to maintain some semblance of normalcy. But as time went on, my behavior became increasingly erratic.\n\nI started to withdraw from my friends and family, spending more and more time alone, meditating on the dreams and the message that the creature had given me. I stopped going to work, convinced that there were more important things that I needed to focus on.\n\nAnd then, one day, the creature appeared to me again. This time, it was no longer just a presence in my dreams. It was real, standing before me in all its terrifying glory.\n\nI should have been afraid, but instead, I felt a sense of calm wash over me. The creature spoke to me, its voice echoing in my mind like a chorus of ancient spirits. It told me that it had chosen me for a reason, that I had been blessed with a gift that few others could understand.\n\nAnd then it offered me a choice. I could continue to fight against it, to try and deny the truth of what I had become. Or I could accept it, embrace the darkness and the power that lay within me.\n\nIn that moment, I knew what I had to do. I accepted the creature as a part of my life, and it accepted me in turn. From that day forward, I became something more than human, something ancient and powerful.\n\nBut as my powers grew, so did my madness. I became isolated, spending more and more time in the shadows, communing with the creature and the other beings that inhabited that world beyond ours. And though I knew that I was losing my grip on reality, I couldn't bring myself to care.\n\nAs I accepted the creature into my life, I felt its presence grow stronger and more oppressive. It was no longer a comforting guide but a malevolent force, twisting my thoughts and desires to its own ends.\n\nThe dreams it showed me were no longer filled with strange landscapes and creatures. They were nightmares, horrific visions of blood and pain, of twisted and mutilated bodies, of grotesque rituals that made my stomach turn.\n\nAnd yet, I could not turn away. The creature had become a part of me, and I was addicted to the feeling of power that it gave me.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the darkness, I began to lose control of my own mind. I lashed out at those around me, alienating friends and family with my erratic behavior. I lost my job, my home, and any sense of stability that I had once had.\n\nAnd still, I could not resist the call of the creature. It promised me even greater power, if only I would continue to serve it.\n\nAnd then, one night, it appeared to me in person. It was a grotesque thing, all twisted flesh and glowing eyes. It spoke to me in a voice that echoed through my very bones, promising me a future beyond my wildest dreams, if I would just follow it into its hellish kingdom of darkness and endless, warped skies.\n\nBut as it spoke, I could feel my sanity slipping away. I knew that I was in the grip of a force that was beyond my understanding, and that it was slowly destroying me.\n\nAnd yet, even as I felt my mind slipping away, I could not resist the lure of the creature's power. I knew that I was destroying my own life, but I was too far gone to care.\n\nIn the end, I became nothing more than a puppet, a pawn in the creature's grand design. I destroyed everything that I had ever loved, all for the promise of power and immortality.\n\nAnd as the creature caressed my face with its twisted claws one last time and brought me to its hellish domain, I knew that I had been deceived. The creature had never been a guide or a mentor, a muse or a guardian. It had been a monster.",

        "text": "Tyler and his kid sister sat at the kitchen table and ate uncooked pop tarts with milk.  \nHe glares across the table at her, right at the bright pink Hannah Montana shirt she wore all the time, the image of that teen idol's plastic smile burned into his brain.  \n\"So is Taylor still messing with you?\" He asked.  \n\"No, not since you beat him up.\"  \n\"I wouldn't have had to if you hadn't of pissed him off. What did you do to him anyway...\"  \n\"Oh you're gonna think I'm evil for this,\" She smiled with that same shit eating grin she knew annoyed him.  \nHe shook his head,  \n\"You are evil.\" He said taking a bite of poptart.  \n\"I kinda started a rumor that he had a crush on that guy Josh.\"  \nTyler made a \\**thump*\\*on the table with his glass.  \n\"Well I'd kick your little ass too if I were him!\"  \nShe busts out laughing, unconcerned with waking their hungover parents. They knew an earthquake wouldn't wake them after date night.  \n\"I didn't mean for it to get around as fast as it did. Me and Katy were joking around and I mentioned that I thought I saw Taylor trying to kiss Josh!\" She washes some pop tart down with milk and wipes her mouth with the sleeve of her jacket.  \n\"Somebody must've overheard us talking and started spreading it around, so it was just an accident.\"  \nTyler shrugged just as he heard the bus pulling up. Then he turned his glass up, enjoying the cold milk falling down his dry throat. He threw his backpack over his shoulder and said,  \n\"YOU ARE AN ACCIDENT...let's go.\"  \nHer grin turned upside down as she followed him out the door.  \n\"Well I'm mom and dad's favorite so BLAH.\"\n\nThey walked through the front yard heading toward the bus.  \nTyler comes to a halt and reaches his hand in front of Angel and stops her.  \n\"What?\" she said.  \n\"You see Taylor right there don't you...\" He nods toward the middle window of the bus where She recognized the chubby pale freckled face of Taylor Barns.  \n\"Yeah, so?\"  \n\"He's not alone.\"  \nThen she notices the other two boys glaring right at them.  \n\"Crap! they're gonna try and jump us! What do we do!?\" She imagined herself getting beat up by Taylor's big ass while his friends beat up Tyler.  \n\"We're gonna walk to school. I don't feel like dealing with these assholes today.\"  \n\"We can't! That'll take forever to walk!\"  \n\"I know a shortcut through the woods. We'll get there before they will.\"  \n\"I've never been in the woods...what if we get lost!\" She insisted.  \nTyler grabbed her wrist and lead her away from the bus as it's doors closed and moved away. On the same block, stood the remains of a condemned house. She thought they were going inside, but then Tyler cuts and walks around it. Behind the old house was the beginning of thick brush and tall trees that had dead limbs hanging above. In front of them, leading through all of the fading green red and yellow colors of autumn, was a walked down path that stretched forward as far as She could see, and fallen leaves covering the ground every step of the way.  \n\"We can cut right through the woods and come up behind the school. It's only about a mile walk.\"\n\n\\*Crunch\\*\n\nTyler stepped into the edge of the forestation and made it several yards out before he realised he was alone. He turned around to see his little sister standing still with wide eyes.  \n\"Come on! we gotta hurry or we'll be late!\" He yelled.  \n\"I don't want too...\" Angel said, her voice shaking.  \n\"We don't have a choice, now come on!\"  \n\"It's scary in there! I'm not going...\"  \n\"Don't do this to me angel, not now goddammit...\" He groaned hard, already feeling groggy from poor sleep, and more than pissed about the long terrible day he predicted would end with him fighting off three overweight kids with bad breath.  \nAngel folds her arms and says with a smart ass tone,  \n\"I won't do it! and you can't,\"  \nTyler all but leaps over to her and grabs her by the scruff of her coat.  \n\"You listen to me you little shit, because of you I'm gonna have to deal with those assholes probably all year!\" He growled through his teeth.  \n\"I don't want to walk through these woods either and because of you I don't have a choice. Now follow me or I'll leave you here!\"  \nShe starts welling up with tears, but Tyler didn't buy it. She did that all the time with their parents just to get her way.  \n\"You won't leave me here! mom and dad will kill you!\" calling Tyler's bluff.  \n\"FINE!\" Tyler pushed her down on her butt and leaving her behind.  \n\"Tyler if you leave me here I'll go wake mom and dad up right now!\" her confidence faded when he didn't look back or slow down as he marched forward on the trail.  \nShe didn't want too, but she knew she didn't have a choice. So she followed.  \n\"Oh God...I don't like this...HEY LET ME CATCH UP!\" she began running through the brush trying to catch up to her brother.  \n\n\nHe didn't want to talk to her or let alone even look at Angel. All he did was try to tune out her complaining for most of the walk.  \nHe kept a quick pace to stay ahead of her, and still kept track of her by listening to her bitch about the woods and how mean he always was to her; more so, he kept track from her dragging her feet through the leafs, sounding as though they were hissing at her for kicking them up. He could hear every step she took and knew she was still right behind him. And it wore on him.  \n\\*CRUNCH CRUNCH\\*  \nHe was sick of her.  \n\\*CRUNCH CRUNCH\\*  \nHe was sick of her getting everything that he wanted .  \n\\*CRUNCH CRUNCH\\*  \nHe was sick of being her caretaker.  \n\\*CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH\\*  \nHe was sick of his parents treating her like a princess and treating him like a workhorse. He was so tired.  \nThe injustice of his situation was getting to be too much. He did most of the chores around the house and always after a full day at school. He wasn't a slacker academically either. He maintained a B average and could even score an -A- in math when he felt like it. Sleep was a problem lately. Now it was bad dreams. They started over a few weeks ago and he had been dealing with the grogginess and fatigue from it everyday.  \nAs he followed the path, he made wishes that his parents would stop dismissing his complaints and would actually try to help him with his sleep problem.  \nMaybe they could take a little bit of that money they blew every weeke*nd on* weed and booze and get him some medicine that'll help him sleep. That's all he wanted. Maybe he'd Just skip school today, go home and lay back down in his bed. He didn't care if he got yelled at. He didn't care if he had another nightmare; bring on the damn SPIDERS!  \nHe started to enjoy the walk some. The weather was cool and the woods were grey and beautiful today. And It was quiet. Not even the birds were chirping like they do in the summer. Save for the sound of shuffling leafs under his feet, it was calm and tranquil out there...save for the sound of leafs.\n\n\\*CRUNCH\\*\n\nHe stopped in his tracks. Now it was almost silent out there. After he enjoyed only a few minutes of a relaxing walk through the woods, he realized something terrible. Dread came crawling up in his guts as it dawned on him that he hadn't heard a second shuffle in the leafs this whole time; he had blocked it all trying to escape this day. He turned around to see that Angel was no where in sight. As far as he could see, she was gone.\n\nHe kicked up leafs and dirt running back down the path. He reached the spot in the trail where he thought he last heard her.  \nHe looked all around, but saw nothing; no evidence that she was ever here. He looked at all the rotting crumbling leafs and sticks littered on the ground everywhere searching for a trail she might have left behind, but he couldn't even find his own tracks in the cold dried dead earth that blanketed the area.  \nHe took a deep breath.  \n\"ANGEL!!! I'M GONNA KICK YOUR ASS WHEN I FIND YOU!!!\"  \nHe yelled as loud he could in the slim hope that she was pranking him for earlier.  \n\"THIS ISN'T FUNNY ANGEL! YOU'RE GONNA MAKE US LATE!\"  \nHe heard nothing but the little cracks and twitches of nature.  \nHe took another deep breath.  \n\"FINE THEN! I'M GOING HOME AND WAKING MOM AND DAD UP AND TELL THEM EVERYTHING THAT YOU DID, LIKE HOW YOU GOT ME INTO FIGHTS AND HOW YOU AIN'T LISTENING  \nAND HOW YOU WANDERED OFF AWAY FROM ME!\" He took a quick breath to yell even louder; he was crying now.  \n\"GOD DAMN IT I HATE YOU!\"  \n\"I HATE YOU LITTLE BITCH!!!!!\" He hurt his throat yelling that hard. He never felt this frightened before. He lost his baby sister and he knew he'd b*e blamed for* it. He was panicking. T*hen something* merciful occurred to him, and it made so much sense, he a*lmost immedia*tely started to feel calm.  \nHe wasn't ce*rtain, but at least he had* an excuse to just forget it and head to school.\n\n(That little brat turned around and went home! He turned around and started walking back down the trail; Thank God!)\n\nHe could make it to class and not have to deal with her, and if he saw Taylor, he could just walk wide circles around his fat ass. Then he could go home and maybe his Mom and Dad will hear him out and Angel will get scolded for once in her spoiled rotten little life. The best part of it all was that he could go back to bed and sleep; nightmares be damned. He'd grab the biggest fattest spider and use it for a pillow!  \nHe'll sleep and...  \nand...  \nthen...  \nThen he heard it.  \nSomething, a voice, a whisper, dancing through the silence of the woods. What is that? Faint, far away, but he heard it. It almost sounded like a person singing a note, dangling in the air like it was tied to a string. It was resonating with him, within him. He thought of a fishing lure in the water, flickering beautifully for any big mouth that might bite at it. That memory coming from fishing trips with his father. Yes. Think of a little fish swimming around in the bottom of the ocean, the pitch blackness of the deep. As black as space, minus the stars as not even the sun can be seen in the deep waters. What would you do if you were down there alone and scared and then suddenly you *spotte*d salvation? A light! A little bulb of light just floating there in the nothing; Beautiful, Warm and just for you; would you have the sense to question it, or would you just chase it?  \nAnd he chased it.\n\nThe voice sounded light and female. Sweet and calming. He didn't understand, but somehow he's whole mind was calm, yet his thoughts were clouded. His judgement subdued, but he was okay with it.  \nWhere is it? Where is it coming from?  \nHe could almost figure out the direction, but it still felt like it was in the air dangling just above his head. The longer he listened, the more it sounded to him like a woman singing. No words; just harmony.  \nFor a moment, a small opening in the dark clouds in his head, allowed for pessimism to shine through.\n\n(What's happening to me...  \nThis doesn't make sense...  \nI need to go home...)\n\nAbove him, the voice began to fall, creeping down, leading off the trail and deeper into the woods.  \nThe song was all but a lustful taunt now, beckoning him to give chase.\n\n(COME FIND ME...)\n\n\"Who's that!\" He heard it. It was in his head, an alien voice spoke so loud that he actually heard it more clearly than if it was spoken aloud. The opening in the dark clouds were closing and becoming darker like heavy storms with only glimmers of light showing through.\n\n(COME FIND ME...TYLER...)\n\nAnd with that command, he obeyed.\n\n\\*CRUNCH\\*\n\nHe pushed through the dying forest. A machete would be handy. Either way, he was hell bent on finding her, or whatever it was calling him. He forgot about school, about Angel, about getting in trouble with his parents, and about Taylor's fatass. He wasn't studying anything else except,\n\n(HURRY! COME FIND ME!)\n\nThere she was again. There was no mistaking it: this was the voice of a woman. He imagined her features that went along with that sweet voice. Long dark flowing hair, a perfect glowing face with almond eyes and a bright smile. Breasts, hips and long legs, Yes; there was a woman in these woods. Maybe she needed help? Maybe she needed a young man to come save her! Tyler knew none of that made sense, but he still had to find her no matter what.  \nHe reached a thick bush that seemed there was no getting around it, and there was a deep ditch on the other side that he hadn't noticed. He pulled his hands into his jacket, got down and fought and crawled through whatever openings he could find through.  \nAnd what if he did find some weird woman out here; what was going to happen? It was unlikely that he was going to lose his virginity to some sexy siren out in the middle of these woods. He figured he had made it at least a mile or two away from the trail, and considered the trip back. The bush and brier patches annoyed him, as cracks in the dark clouds were letting more light shine through; then the voice would repeat itself:\n\n(HURRY! COME FIND ME! HURRY!)\n\nAnd the dark clouds would regain control over him.  \nThis voice was engaging his adolescence with promises limited only to his imagination, and he had a healthy imagination for his age.  \nShe'd be waiting for him on the other side of this shit, he'll emerge all cut up and bleeding, he'll see her standing there, she'll turn and see him down on all fours exhausted and go to him, drop to her knees getting dirt on her angelic white dress, he'll look up at her and see the most beautiful face he'd ever laid eyes on, she'll smile at him and put her soft warm hands on his face, he'll lay his head in her lap and she'll gently pet his head. Then she'll bend down to tell him something as her bosom squishes against the side of his head; her lips will move and,\n\n\\*CRUNCH\\*\n\nThe ground he reached to grab wasn't there; he fell forward and rolled down the sudden drop into the ditch on the other side, landing flat on his face, hissing at the scraps and cuts.  \n\"that hurt...\"  \nThe lights were on and he escaped the clouds; whatever had him, lost its hold in the fall. He couldn't hear her anymore. He didn't feel tired anymore, just slightly dead inside.  \nFace down in the dirt, he thought about how there was no chance at making it to school on time, how horrible this day was, how things would be if Angel hadn't started shit with Tayler. Better yet, what if she had never been born? The day started off bad enough, and now here he was laying down in the dirt, in the middle of nowhere miles away from home and not sure how he was going to get back. Hell, he wasn't sure how he made it this far.  \nHe turned his head and saw more woods, then he turned the other *way,* resting his cheek on the cool dirt:  \nThe sun was setting.  \nAlready? How long had he been,\n\n\\*Cccccrrraaaaaang\\*\n\nHis head lurched up to the loud metallic shriek. He saw nothing, Almost. He would have missed it otherwise, but he remembered now: the dream; there was something from it that this place conjured up. Right in front of him was a hill where the noise came from. At a first glance, there's nothing remarkable about it, yet somehow, Tyler knew the secret.  \nHe pushed himself up to his feet. He'd seen it before; that's what it was. He couldn't think of it that morning; he had to see it play out in front of him before he could remember it:  \nThere was a faint outline in the hill and Tyler reached and grabbed the side to feel around for...\"There!\"  \nHe pulled with all his strength, then he let go of the big rusty metal door as it fell open, unveiling metal stairs leading down into darkness.  \nHe knew this was here! Maybe an old cellar or a storm shelter, but how did he know it was here?  \nHe looked down and thought of going in, but then thought better of it. He stepped back away from the entrance, then lights flickered over the stairs defeating the darkness that covered them, leading down to a metal door. Tyler realized that it was dark all around him; the sun had finished setting and the daylight was over. The woods around him now scarier than the hole with lights reflecting off the steel walls and stairs. He took his first step following them down careful to not make a sound. He wasn't trying to sneak, but was ready to turn and run back up the steps and into the woods in case he might jump an animal or a homeless man living down here. The metal door wasn't closed all the way, as if someone left it cracked. He pushed and it swung open, revealing a long hallway with more lights flickering on. He went forward, and wasn't so afraid; now he was just curious.\n\n(Some kind of bunker maybe? Old and abandoned, but still has electricity?)\n\nThe hallway made a sharp right turn, then there was another metal door left open as well. The lights were already on inside. Tyler peaked through the crack and saw a room filled with lab equipment.\n\n(Some mad scientist's hidden laboratory? How the hell could something like this be here?)\n\nNone of the equipment was like anything he had ever seen before; even the tech displayed in science fiction movies did this stuff justice: it was all shiny and well kept. Whatever science project that was going on down here was serious, and obviously, a secret.  \nHe passed a file laid open and couldn't resist taking a look.\n\n\"1973 The M.A.W. Project. by Dr. Les.  \nEntry##113 submitted at 4:54 AM  \n'On behalf of the staff at NEW CELL research LAB #13, we require further funding: This project must be finished. It is necessary to do this at the site of where this strand of the NEW CELL anomaly, was located and is where we need to conduct our work. We do not know how to make CELL grow on its own yet, but this environment seems to encourage a reaction. It takes the form of a gas, reduced to a molecular level and singled it out. That's how NEW CELL's R-strand was discovered. It infects organic tissue with a compound never seen in history. It's proven to have high mutative properties, like other NEW CELL strands, but the R-strand has an amazing effect: psychokinetics is developing in the subjects! The R-strand will catapult Bio Engineering to places never thought possible!\"\n\nTyler skips a few pages.\n\n\"It was necessary to have built 'Lab #13 at the sight where R-strand was discovered; It is imperative that our research continue, and is the opinion of this department and myself. The location isn't ideal, but this is also closest to civilian life that NEW CELL has been found to inhabit. It is costly -and risky- but necessary in order to collect this priceless data. You of course have seen the product of the remarkable capabilities of the R-strand with the M.A.W. Project; It's still to soon to move on from this location! So much we still have to learn! This is about the future of our species!\"\n\nTyler flips to the last pages in the file:\n\nRequest to terminate the M.A.W. project.\n\n\"We have accomplished huge strides with the research of the R-strand. We've concluded that this location is not in fact the place of its origin. We can't prove it yet, but we believe now that the R-strand isn't native, or that the location is consequential to the mutations. The cells of R-strand cover this area, slowly growing like any organic matter. We are close to making a significant breakthrough on R-strand, and likely a huge leap in the NEW CELL anomaly.\n\nConcerning The MAW Project, she has proven R-strand's remarkable capabilities, but we feel the project has hit a dead end, and is no longer a viable source for further study. I will note that with careful planning: further development of NEW CELL Projects can heed viable results, and we shouldn't shut the Lab down just yet.  \nHowever, MAW'S devolvement has hit a brick wall. Her higher brain functions mimic that of the human host used, and this could be what is making her feral. However, I don't believe that to be the case. There's something else I've been looking into: It is possible that R-strand itself is where this intelligent/malevolent behavior is coming from. We had removed her brain and three of her limbs for our own protection, yet these problems persist.  \nIf my theory is true, then that means that the NEW CELL anomaly is the most intelligent viral life form ever exhibited. It goes beyond what human evolution has ever been capable of.\n\nConcerning MAW: it is understood that the resources expended on her were substantial, but we've got all that we need and then some from the project. Immediate termination of MAW is requested.  \nLet me also clarify the problems arising for the Lab in keeping her contained here: we believe she's been telepathically commuting with sentient life outside of the perimeter. First we notice an excess of animals wandering closer to the lab, then our security was finding civilian life wandering in the area, and furthermore, somehow getting inside; they never remember how they got here. One poor soul actually made it inside MAW's containment: what we found wasn't a pretty sight. We have other issues of MAW affecting Lab #13 personal. Mostly complaints of strange dreams and emotional problems. Working within such close range of MAW is subject to high stress, and the project wasn't recommended to personal with pre existing mental conditions, as it became common that She could exacerbate the conditions. I myself am having trouble, as I haven't been able to sleep well in months.  \nI and my staff humbly request that a N.C.H. team is sent to sterilize this area, and to terminate the MAW Project.\"\n\nTyler saw there was a tape recorder next to the file. He pressed rewind, and then the Play.\n\n'Those bastards. They actually went ahead and did it. The data we collected over the course of L thirteen's establishment was more than viable enough and worth saving, but no, those bastards never cared. They really went ahead and did it! They're gonna leave us and L thirteen to rot! We got them everything they wanted from the NEW CELL growing in this area, and then they cut their losses and abandon us! R-strand is growing; its infecting this whole area. Yes we were here to research it, but also to contain it! The civilian life that's anywhere within a thousand kilometers will be totally lost...\n\nThey sealed us in here. The team we requested sealed us down here to die!  \nI Wonder how far they'll get before they too are...\n\nIt's MAW again...\n\nI hear her now, she's tempting me. I'm out of time...\"\n\nThe rest of the tape was nearly silent save for steps on the tile floor, echoing as they got further away, until they couldn't be heard, and then silenced altogether. There was nothing now but the light hiss of the tape spinning, and there would be nothing else on the rest of the tape either.\n\n\\**thunk*\\*\n\nTyler heard something. He turned to see another door. He carefully pushed it open, and there was more stairs.  \nNo lights flickered on this time. It looked like the stairway to hell itself. Briefly, there was no way he was going down. So turned back. He was done with this. He was frightened and wanted nothing more than to leave this place and forget about it, the tape, everything. It was cold and lifeless in here. He had to get home. Then, he heard her voice; not the woman, not the sirens song he heard all afternoon, but his sister's voice.\n\n\"Tyler...\"\n\nHe heard it. And it wasn't in his head.  \n\"Hello?\"  \n\"Tyler...\"  \n\"Angel? is that you!\" he yelled.  \nIt was coming from down the rusty stairs, coming from the bottom. No response. He took a deep breath, and then he took the first step down, then another, then on the third, he heard Angel's blood curdling scream eco from the bottom.  \n\"Angel! Hold on!\"  \nHe yelled going down the steps as fast as he could, nearly slipping on what he thought was rags or towels, following Angel's scream all the way to the bottom; down to the precipice.  \nThe scream ceased just he saw a metal door hanging from bent hinges; It was decimated, ripped through like tissue paper. His gut told him to turn and leave now, then something caught his eye: Something familiar was hanging on one of the sharp pieces of the metal door, slivers of cloth. He approached and grabbed it: on the front was torn ribbond of tHanna Montana's face still smiling that plastic smile.  \nTyler felt terror crawl up through his guts.  \nSuddenly the lights came on above.  \nThe floor was covered in discarded clothing. Most of it was adult sized: white lab coats, leather shoes, male and female undergarments, socks, and more laying everywhere. Watches, cellphones, pens, wigs, jewelry, etc.  \nHe looked up the stairs, and saw even more just littered all the way up.  \nHe realized something horrible: Nothing can get close to this place without coming under the influence of this MAW...How many people had wandered down here just like himself? Facing the stairs, he stepped on something sizeable. He bent down, and found that it was a backpack. Hanna Montana's face plastered on it too.  \nIt was Angel's. He went down to his hands and knees and found a small pile of clothes, jeans, pink socks, a bright pink jacket and white panties.  \nHe became nauseous, his stomach twisting itself up as he understood that Angel, along with all these other people had all been...\n\n\\**CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH*\\*\n\nThe sickening sound found his ears, and then, he heard that woman's voice speak aloud,\n\n\"Tyler, You found me.\"\n\n(The little fish that swims in the darkness will see the dangling light and approach it; never seeing the terrifying mouth of the anglerfish waiting just behind the light.)\n\nA moist and warm gust of air covered him, and behind it was the mouth that exhaled it. Tyler on all fours, turned his head around to see it, and what he saw was a giant gaping mouth, filled with large jagged teeth, smelling of death and wide enough to bite him in half.  \nFor a moment, he didn't want to run away.  \nFor a moment, the mouth seemed to not be so threatening.  \nFor a moment, he was almost at peace with it, then that turned into a euphoria, rapturous, pleasurable even. The dark clouds were thundering, blocking all light, all sense. He was okay with this. Even wanted it...for a moment.  \nThen, as the mouth neared and began closing down, he saw something hanging from one of the long yellow stained teeth: something little, long and black. Like a worm? No...  \nHe then realized what it was, and all the clouds blow away as sheer horror swept through like a 200 mph wind: It was in fact, a lock of hair from Angel's head. The mouth spoke once more as the fresh stince of blood and guts seeped from the beastly dripping mouth:\n\n\"You found me.\"\n\nHe screamed louder then he ever had in his life. His fight or flight chose the latter. His prone position was almost that of a runner's stance, as the mouth started to close down for a bite. Tyler lunged up the metal staircase, the piles of clothes, phones and jewelry impeding him every step of the way, all the while that hot sick breath was rushing up his shirt. He made it halfway up the stairs and looked back at it to see if he was getting away from it. When he did, an even louder scream erupted from him with tears and mucus pouring from his face. He saw a massive hand reaching up for him, big enough to grab him around his waist and crush him into pulp, and pull him back down to face the same nightmarish death that his kid sister met. He caught a good look at the thing: a huge humanoid, that looked like it would have been a giant, but there was nothing below its lower torso. The hand swiped at him just barely missing the temporarily despondent boy, its large nails making deep scratches on the metal, sending an ear splitting shriek through the air. Tyler cuffed his ears in pain. He saw it trying to orient itself to take another swipe. It seemed to look up and let out a guttural roar at him, spitting its saliva and little tiny pieces of Angel all over him. Then he saw that the thing was missing its eyes: above the mouth, everything; a nose, its cranium, eyeholes, were gone. Atop of the mouth was just the healed over stump from where those things used to have been, maybe.  \nThat huge hand was connected to a long muscular arm, the only limb it seemed to have left. Then all at once, Tyler understood it:\n\n(It can't do much else but eat. So it got good at luring its meals down to it...  \nLike one of those parasites that wiggle into the head of a grasshopper and make it commit suicide and that's how the worm survived...That's how this thing survived. He could hear it; feel it. The same voice the owners of these piles of clothes heard. The same voice that Angel heard.  \nThat same sweet voice that lured him down, all the way from home, was now trying to wiggle its way back into his head. She was telling him that everything was alright; come back down, take your clothes off -and anything else that if wouldn't like to chew on- and everything will be alright. Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down come down come down come down Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down come down come down come down Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down come down come down come down Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down come down come down come down  \nCome down. Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down come down come down come down Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down. Come down come down come down come down Come down. Come down. Come down.)\n\n\"COME DOWN TO ME NOW!!!!!\"\n\nTyler snapped out of it for the last time as She lurched forward, mouth open wide. Tyler turned to the metal stairs, crawled up the rest of them and finally reached the door. He bolted through the lab, hearing both her voice in his head, beckoning him, while the monster was bellowing from below; cursing at the escape of its meal. Tyler passed the file, and grabbed it thinking he might need it later with all the rational thinking he had left, besides running. He reached the long hallway, the echo of his shoes coming down on the metal engulfing everything including her cries for him. He leaped out of the big metal door, and he got on the other side of it and pushed with all his strength, making slam back shut. Then he was out into the dark woods, at this point the safest place in the world to him. He didn't stop. He ran back the way he came. He made his way around the hill he fell down, found the path through the brush that he made earlier and finally after scurrying through all of it again, he found the path to the school; the same path he could take home. The running wasn't over; not yet; Not until he saw his parents.  \n\n\nHis mother and father sat on the front porch along with several police officers who were gathering up for a search party. The mother with her head in her hands and the father was speaking to the police officer taking down descriptions in his book.  \nThe red and blue lights of the police cars lit the whole street up, and that's how Tyler found his way back. He saw the lights and new that that had to be his block. He held the file in his hand that would prove that everything he saw was true. He finally took a moment to catch his breath...\n\nThen, she spoke to him again, and he listened...and he listened.\n\nHis mother looked up with tears in her eyes and almost didn't see him: her son was standing there covered in dirt, grime and little bleeding cuts all over him. He was empty handed. She cried and ran to her son and embraced him as his father and the police officers followed. She hugged him tight. She loved him and he felt it. His father kneeled down with tears in his eyes, checking Tyler's wounds.  \n\"Tyler, what happened?\"  \n\"Tyler, are you okay?\"  \n\"Tyler, talk to me baby!\"  \n\"Tyler...where's Angel?\"  \nHe was in awe. He looked up to the night sky without saying anything. He saw that the stars were out. They cared. They cared. He felt like he was the center of their world. And it made him feel good. This felt good. She was right.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n\n\nTyler woke up at 6:00 AM to the sound of his alarm blaring ZZ Top. He was sleeping so well that he hated the alarm. He stretched and pulled himself out of bed. He looked out of his window and saw the sun creeping up from behind the line of trees of the woods behind that old house. He grabbed the window seal and stretched himself. He left his room, past the hallway bathroom, and then went into the room that -use to- belong to Angel. The posters still hung, but the room was a mess where the police had searched it for any possible leads. He ignored the mess like his parents did, albeit for different reasons.  \nHe enjoyed a shower. Angel's shower that was.  \nIn the kitchen he ate uncooked poptarts with milk. He was feeling great, well rested and had a sense of wellbeing he hadn't felt in a long time. He thought about trying out for basketball, or maybe football. The school bus pulled up outside and he slammed his milk and ran out the door. On the bus he sat in the middle, right next to a girl he had never talked to before, and they struck up a conversation.  \nAs they got off the bus she waved at him and saying whe would love to have lunch with him. He smiled and turned to go to class. He ended up trying out for football and fell in love with the sport that day. He liked his coach, and he made friends with almost everyone on the team. Everyone except for one big freckled face Taylor Barns. When Tyler caught up with him after school, Taylor didn't know what to say to this knew and very chipper Tyler. They had gotten into a fight over his sister, and then she was pronounced dead, all back in the fall. When the bus passed his house, it seemed to be a ghost house with nobody home. Now here he was trying to make friends? How could he say no. He thought that he should try and be nice. Felt like he owed him that much. He didn't have much of a choice though...  \nNo choice, really.  \nSee, Taylor had recently been experiencing some sleep deprivation, all from some recurring nightmares within the last week, give or take. Perhaps brought on by some remorse; an underserved guilt over the disappearance of Tyler's kid sister.  \nHe didn't know why it was happening; he definitely didn't know that Tyler knew about it, either. Taylor agreed to hang out with him after practice, and they would walk to Tyler's house, play video games, and talk about football.  \nTyler told him that he knew a shortcut through the woods. Taylor Barns smiled, and Tyler smiled right back...\n\nand so did she.\n\n\\**CRUNCH*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWritten by Jacob Pittman.",

        "text": "Before I start, I'm using a throwaway account to protect my identity to an extent. My Partner could probably recognise this as being about them if they ever discovered it, but I need to get some outside opinions on it all and how I should act next, if at all.\n\n  For context, me and my partner have been together now for what will be 6 years on our anniversary this May. We've lived together for 4 years of this relationship, and they proposed this last November just gone to what was an immediate yes from me, cue plans to get married on what would be our 6th anniversary this year. I love them dearly, and do not know what I would do without them since we have began living together. They are simply an ingrained part of my life and emotional wellbeing at this point.\n\n  Anyway, fast forward to this January, it's been a while since the proposal and things have been going well in my own opinion, however my SO has grown cold, antisocial, I don't know how else to describe it but they have changed rather suddenly into a recluse that seems to only be interested in their computer. I should probably mention that they have worked from our home in the web development industry since COVID first became a thing, a job they had held previously from the office for the last 5 years, so the majority of our entire relationship I have always known them to be something of a tech fanatic, always enthusiastic and thrilled to tell me about the newest feature they'd been working on even if they knew I didn't share the same level of knowledge, and seeing how much joy it bought them to work on these things and share the accomplishments with me I too have tried to be passionate about their passion.\n\n  But as I mentioned, that changed this January, and suddenly they have become almost instantly cold and antisocial, nothing like their normal self. My first thought knowing they've had a history of mild depression was that their mental health was simply playing up due to the usual stresses of modern life, bills and meeting expectations etc. however 2 weeks into this behaviour and it hit a peak when for the 4th day running they stayed in our office typing away until the small hours of the morning with the door locked and the lights turned out. They had completely stopped coming up to bed at this point like we would every other day of our lives living together prior to this change in behaviour, and would instead crash out in the office while I slept alone upstairs, and by this 4th day I'd had enough, having gotten maybe 5 whole sentences out of them over the entire period and no explanation when asked if something was wrong other than that they were \"Busy with a new project and it was very important.\"\n\n  At this point it was not like them at all, and although I may sound overdramatic I was deeply concerned, and had all kinds of thoughts going through my head. Were they seriously ill with mental health? Were they cheating? Had I done something I was unaware of to warrant how cold they were being? I didn't have any answers, and speaking to them provided none either, as they would just brush me off on what was becoming the rare occasion they wasn't locked in our office typing away in the dark. Skip to the end of this January, it's around 3 AM one night and for whatever reason despite having gotten used to them not sharing our bed I couldn't sleep. I went downstairs to check if they was still up and saw the office door left wide open, weird but not that strange in the grand scheme. What was weird however was that at 3 AM with no notice or explanation they was nowhere to be seen in the office itself, or downstairs at all for that matter. I called out for them, thinking perhaps they'd went into the living room and I just hadn't noticed them, before something urged me to check the office further. People talk about gut instincts and I suppose given how strange and antisocial they had been acting recently with no explanation that I was just following mine, because for whatever reason I went in and checked.\n\n  Their computer was still open and running on the screen when I went in, not that odd had they been downstairs still and not long left the room I suppose, so I decided to look at it. Again, I don't know why and I guess it was just gut instinct given my fears they had been cheating or suffering mentally with their recent change in attitude towards everything. While I never use it myself it is technically our shared computer, although they was the only one to use it for their work from home, and as I owned a separate laptop for sending emails and studies I never had reasons to have checked it before this. What I saw when I did confused me greatly.\n\n  I'm not a computer wiz like they are by any means, but I knew what the desktop usually looked like. A wallpaper of a photo of us together on a date, celebrating our first year together, taken only a few weeks after they'd gotten the web development job, covered in about a thousand different shortcuts and a completely disorganised mess, but one that they claimed before now was how they liked it as they knew their way around it all. Now though there was no wallpaper of us, no shortcuts, it was just blank. And not blank like a generic background you get on a new PC, no, literally just a white background with the menu bar at the bottom. It was like they had completely reset the PC and set the wallpaper to a plain white background, save for one shortcut in the middle of the screen. It was a text document simply titled HELP ME. My mind raced as soon as I saw this, putting 2+2 together immediately with them not being anywhere to be seen and their recent attitude changes that I was right about them being mentally sick. I clicked the document without thinking and it opened to an empty text document, save for one website link. I won't include the link in this post as I don't know the rules surrounding doing that, but I checked it out myself immediately. It could have been an important work project they'd labelled that way as 'HELP ME' because they was struggling to get through it, it could've been anything, but with all the doubts and questions running through my mind I didn't stop to think reasonably. It was nearly 4 AM at this point and my partner was nowhere to be seen following weeks of them having turned into a hermit locked in this office ignoring me, and I wasn't about to ignore this potential source of answers. I copied the link, opened Google and pasted it quicker than anything.\n\n  It loaded up a website, a screen just as empty as the text document I'd found the link in, save for characters written all down the screen. It was a literal wall of text, all just unintelligible strings of letters and numbers, none of which made any obvious sense. The only way I can describe it is that it looked like one of those screens out of the matrix, only with black text on a white screen rather than green writing, and it clearly wasn't English or any recognisable language. It sounds weird given my concern but it actually put my mind at ease a little when I saw this. I was expecting the link to take me to conversations with other people being unfaithful, or some kind of emotional breakdown, but instead it was just a text document of some unintelligible characters that probably related to their work in some way. I closed the website and thought nothing more of it at the time, more concerned by where they was at this time in the morning with no explanation having left the computer running in this weird state. I rang them a few times to no luck, going to voicemail each time, left them a message asking where they'd gone and debated going out to look for them, but ultimately I left it and instead waited in the living room, deciding I'd contact their parents if they hadn't returned by the morning to see if they'd heard from them. After all, they're an adult, they aren't under a curfew, however odd it was.\n\n  I must have fell back to sleep waiting for them, because I was woke up by the sounds of banging nearby. I jolted awake as anyone would to see them pacing the room and hallways, hitting the walls as they went. Immediately I jumped up and went to ask them what the heck was wrong, and when I did they turned on me and started shouting that they knew I'd been snooping through the computer. To say I was shocked would be an understatement, even at the coldest points of their recent mood change they had never been angry like this, and in the entire time we've lived together while I've never made a habit out of going through the computer they've never cared before if I have had to use it, much less to this level of aggression. I tried to explain that I just closed it down when I saw it open, and was confused where they'd disappeared at that time, but it didn't matter to them. They just shouted that I \"didn't f*cking know what I was getting myself involved in\" and stormed into the office locking it behind them. I banged on the door a few times, telling them I didn't understand, not to ignore me, that I was worried about them, but none of it went through or got a response. It sounds petty, but I was heartbroken. My partner of 6 years I was engaged to had never hid things from me, much less treated me like this over something so trivial and unexplained. I went back up to bed, locked the door and after venting to a friend about my concerns over text and sending them the link to see if they agreed that my partner was out of order reacting the way they did to me opening it I fell back to sleep, having barely slept properly waiting up for them and being woke to this.\n\n  I woke up again a few hours later to a quiet house, and noticed they was laid next to me under the covers fast asleep having obviously climbed in while I was out of it as if nothing had happened. I got out of bed and went back downstairs, made a coffee and went to sit on the front doorstep with a cigarette, opened my phone and saw a fleet of messages from my friend spamming my inbox as if there was a dire emergency, telling me to message them back ASAP and that I was right to be confused.\n\n  I should mention that said friend is actually a shared friend of both me and my partner that they knew long before I did and long before we got together, although when I first befriended them it was through College, and I had no idea they knew my partner at the time, so we formed a close friendship for many weeks before finally realising we all knew each other when they came round to the house and needed no introduction from me. I only mention this to provide the context that they knew my partner's occupation, and shared an interest in computers and the like.\n\n  I rang them back while my partner was still up sleeping, and they told me that they'd seen the link and that it was really weird. I agreed but downplayed it, I mean yeah it was odd that they had a link to a load of gibberish and nothing else but in the grand scheme of things it wasn't the strangest thing imaginable. Only it wasn't gibberish according to the friend. I probably should've thought more into that when I discovered the link, but I was more concerned by my missing partner and the fact it was titled Help Me while they were nowhere to be found, given their attitude over the past weeks. Upon asking my friend what the heck they meant they explained to me that the writing on the website was actually a coded message, which I suppose wouldn't be so surprising at all on a developer's computer, but my friend went on to explain further when I retorted with that, confused why it was such a big deal to them.\n\n  Apparently the code wasn't just some website that was hard to work on like I might have presumed, it was actually an encrypted piece of writing. They explained that they'd recognised the first few lines of text to be something called a Caesar Cipher, like the salad, and that it was apparently an incredibly basic and well known way of encrypting text, or at least basic and well known to everybody within those circles excluding me I suppose. They explained further that the text was written for the first 3 or 4 lines in this way and that they'd been able with how simple it was to translate those first few lines into something that resembled English, but that it wasn't intelligible or coherent writing by any means, and that after a few lines it simply either stopped making any form of sense or switched to a different encryption, because they had no luck whatsoever of making anything out of the rest of what was there past the first few lines.\n\n  Obviously this all made zero sense to me, so I told them this and how confused I was by it all and they apologised, explaining that they didn't mean to confuse me and that it was probably just incoherent button smashing for the rest of the text, not to worry about it all unless more came from it and that they could send the translation they'd managed to make out of those first few lines over to me if it'd help to put my mind at ease, warning that it really didn't make any sense as it was and could easily be an incorrect translation on their behalf with how nonsensical and strange it seemed. They sent me a text shortly after and I'm honestly unsure now of how to feel at all about it all, whether I should confront my partner further regarding it or what to do. According to the translation they managed to make, the first few lines of the gibberish code read the following, and there's an entire page filled with more my friend couldn't decode for me:\n\n  \"She is underneath the big room and they keep saying they will know how she got there. If this is public I am sorry but I need to explain this before the blackmail continues. I am not the monster they want for it I only cooperated for our safety. I now wish I never saw.\"",

        "text": "I recently visited a Native American reservation, a Choctaw one to be exact. Me and a group of college kids went over there to listen to some stories for an Anthropology class we’re in. We were gathered in a building, and an elder there told us a story I really wanna share with everyone else. The elder guy was about 80 years old or so. He had lots of stories but the one I’m gonna tell you guys was the one he wanted us to remember the most, because it’s a story that carries a warning with it. I asked him if it’d be alright to share it online, and he was fine with it. The more people hear it he says, the better. So here’s the story:\n\n He told us the story of this one time his grandpa and his friends went camping, about 100 years or so ago. At that time, the tribe had largely been assimilated by the US Government, and moved to the current reservation, and when his grandpa and his buddies were free from being forced to attend boarding schools, they would return home and go out to be with nature. \n\nOne summer they headed out into the nearby forest, and they brought some hunting supplies with them. They got pretty deep into the forest, far enough in that they couldn’t be found without someone walking for a few hours. They had found a small clearing and thought it was perfect to set up camp. They gathered some sticks and whatnot and made a fire. They’d brought some food with them, some fishing poles, bags, blankets, a simple kodak camera, a shotgun with a few bullets, and few other supplies. The weather was sunny and hot, that kind of mid-July weather when everything is humid and uncomfortable. The nights are cool and tolerable though, so they liked to sleep out on the ground near the fire, and look up at the stars in between the trees at night. \n\nTheir parent’s didn’t mind much ‘cause they said they wanted them to be in touch with their roots. They’d been taught a lot of survival stuff from a young age, so they were more equipped to deal with that stuff than most kids. Plus they had each other in case any of them got into trouble. People were just built differently then, the elder said. So with their parent's permission the boys set out to spend a few weeks out in the woods. They had their campsite all set up, and a makeshift shelter made out of sticks and dead leaves. They’d go out into the woods together to shoot birds and catch fish. They’d spend most of the day walking around the forest, playing in the stream, hunting, and playing hide and seek. At night, they’d gather around the campfire, roast their meat and tell stories and gossip. The elder said his grandpa and his friends did this every year when they could, and that they had a lot of fun. It all changed one summer night though. \n\nIt was one summer back in the late 1890s. He and his friends had gone out to their campsite like they did every summer. They'd been there for a few days, when the weather started changing. It had started getting more cloudy lately, and the kids weren't sure if they wanted to stay out or head home. Not wanting their camping trip to be cut short so they stayed. So that night his grandpa and his friends had been sleeping, when he had been woken up by a cold wind. He was shivering, and the fire had gone out. There weren’t even embers left over. His friends were apparently all fast asleep, and warm under their blankets, but grandpa had neglected to bring one with him. The nights were cool, but under the covers they could get really muggy and uncomfortable, so he liked to sleep out uncovered. He was regretting it now, and with the fire out the forest was nearly pitch black. There were quite a few clouds as it seemed a storm was moving in, so he didn’t even have star or moonlight to see. He was about to get up to wake one of his friends when he stopped dead in his tracks. He couldn’t be sure at first, but there was some sound in the wind. It started low at first, but it got louder. He heard some kind of animalistic screaming. His grandpa apparently said it sounded like a mix between a cow screaming and a pig squealing. It was the kind of sound that made a person wanna crawl into a grave and die before whatever made that sound got to them. Apparently his grandpa couldn’t properly explain the sound to the elder, but it was the most terrifying sound he had ever heard in his life. \n\nOne of his friends woke up in a rage and yelled at the grandpa to cut it out, and that it wasn’t funny. His grandpa started arguing with the other kid and told him he wasn’t making that sound. The commotion had made the other kids wake up. The screaming was still going on, and all of the sudden all of them were silent as they listened. They heard rustling in the nearby woods, and the sound was getting louder. The elder’s grandpa tried to look out into the forest, but the darkness obscured his sight. He could hardly make out the black outlines of the trees. Freaked out, they all got up, and one of the kids grabbed the shotgun they had laying around. They listened to the screaming, all of them too scared to speak. The screaming suddenly cut out, and all that could be heard was the rustling of the wind. The kids all tried to sit back down and get back to sleep. His grandpa laid awake for a few hours listening to the wind. He managed to start a small fire again, and sat around it for a while while the air blew around him. He didn’t hear anything for the rest of the night, and before he knew it, he had fallen asleep again. \n\nEveryone woke up the next morning, to find tracks nearby the campsite. They were deer footprints. It seemed like someone had been hunting a deer last night. That would help to explain the screaming they heard. Someone must've gone into the woods late last night and hunted it down. But they could find no blood, or any signs of struggle. Stranger still, the footprints were alone, and they were staggered in an odd manner. Deer footprints tend to be much closer together but these were far apart. And they lead to the campsite. The boys mostly figured no one had got hurt, so they shrugged it off. They did things as usual that morning. They set out into the forest, and started hunting. They killed a few small birds, and brought them back to the campsite. They had lunch, and then they started playing out in the woods. It was still pretty cloudy out that day. They played until they got deeper and deeper into the forest. Soon, it was getting dark, and they needed to head back to the site. The kids started heading back when they heard the screaming again. \n\nIt was really quiet, but it was unmistakable. The kids started walking faster. The screaming was getting louder. They started to run. Out of nowhere, this huge shape comes rushing through the forest at them. It flew by so quickly they couldn’t get their eyes to see it properly. Whatever it was, it was fast, white in color, and impossibly loud. They all stopped running and gathered together. Their breaths ragged and hearts beating a mile a minute. Whatever it was rushed right past them, screaming and hollering the entire time. Then it was gone. The screaming however, wasn’t. The boys started back even faster than before. They all made it to the campsite, panting. One of the boys said that they wanted to go home. Another kid said it was all a prank and someone was messing with them. One of the other kids was sure it was a bear or something. One kid was crying his eyes out and saying it was a Kashehotapolo, and it was gonna kill them. \n\nWhat on earth is a Kashehotapolo?  Well, the elder explained that the local Choctaw tribes knew of a supernatural creature that was half-man, half-deer, and that it featured prominently in a lot of local legends. It’s called the *Kashehotapolo.* It’s similar to the Goatman, but also a lot different. For one, a lot of Native American tribes around the country have stories about it. Some say they are malevolent creatures hellbent on killing whoever happens to stumble into their territory. Other stories say they are mischievous beings and simply enjoy scaring the crap out of people. Other stories paint them as witches who have animalistic powers, who dwell in forests waiting for men to seduce and kill. In some legends they are even helpful and kind. They go by a lot of names, but the Choctaw and many Plains Indians see them as terrifyingly evil creatures. The Choctaw in particular admire and fear the creature for its strength and speed. Some say they exist to get revenge on hunters that kill too many animals in the forest, and that they’re spiritual apparitions the forest creates to kill hunters that take too much from it. \n\nMost boys would have laughed at that kid, but the elder’s grandpa and his friends had taken it pretty seriously. He and all of them had grown up being told about these creatures. One of the other kids said it was a demon and that all they needed to do was pray and they’d be alright. One thing was for certain, it was getting far too dark to make their way back home out of the forest. They would have to spend another night in the forest with whatever this creature was. Elder’s grandpa didn’t know what was more frightening; having a Kashehotapolo in the forest with them, or a bear or something else. They huddled around together in their makeshift shelter. The shelter was pretty small and cramped, so they had to stay close together and look out of the opening in the shelter for signs of the beast. The night was dark and the wind started up again. There were dark clouds in the sky, and the kids didn’t dare get out to start a campfire. The entire time they sat talking about the creature and what it could be, the screaming never stopped. The wind blew, and the sounds of its screaming faded in and out. They heard twigs snapping, and leaves rustling in many random directions. None of the boys could get a read on where the screaming was coming from. \n\nIt started to rain lightly. The boys started shivering, and the screaming was getting louder. The grandpa heard a scream right next to his ear that made him jump. Then the scream darted away in the opposite direction. The boy sat there shivering as the rain got heavier. Thunder began to sound out, making it even harder to tell where the strange animalistic scream was coming from. Every few moments, lightning would strike out in the distance, and the boys would see a half second of flash, which let them see the surrounding forest. The trees would be illuminated a dull electric blue for a split second, then right back to pitch black. They could see the rain dropping and the trees swaying with the wind with every flash. Then thunder would rumble and shake the boys more than they already were. And the screaming would fade out, before coming back just as strong. The grandpa stared out at the forest as the lighting struck, and said he swore he saw something walking in the swaying trees. It was impossibly tall. White skin, and long, lanky arms that reached nearly to the ground. He said it moved so fast he couldn’t make out its face. \n\nIt was a strange thing. Its head clearly had antlers, and its feet seemed to have hooves. And yet when it moved, one could easily mistake it as one of the swaying trees in the forest. With each movement of its legs, and its arms reached back, mimicking the tree branches around it. The elder’s grandfather could hardly breathe. The other boys apparently had seen it too. There was no more whining or jumping. No crying or sniffling. The rain leaking through the leaves on the makeshift shelter that slowly soaked them didn’t even bother them. They were all paralyzed with utter fear as they all watched the thing appear with the lightning flashes and then disappear. The screaming all the time fading in and out with the wind. \n\nThey stayed like that almost the entire night, clutching each other. Art some points the screaming would stop, only for it begin again right next to the shelter, the boys crying and begging or the thing to go away. Eventually, the rain started to slow down. The creature got more and more silent. Then there was calm at last. The grandpa had apparently managed somehow to fall asleep a little before dawn as the storm calmed down. He was the first to wake up. He poked his head cautiously and listened for the creature’s screams. When the coast seemed clear, he got out of the shelter without waking the other boys and started gathering their things. He was bending down to grab his camera, when he heard the screaming start up again. He turned and the creature was right next to him. His breath caught in his throat. He raised his camera and lifted the kodak's flap quickly to take a picture. The thing screamed and lunged for him, causing him to shout. The other boys woke up at this and they rushed out to see what was the matter. Luckily for the elder's grandpa, the thing seemed to have rushed past him into the woods. The boys wasted no time getting the heck out of those woods. They grabbed as much as they could and they left immediately, heading back to civilization. All the time they ran through the forest, they heard the screaming in the background, following them out of the forest. Painfully, eventually, they made it to their town. When they had gotten home, elder’s granddad had told his mother about what had happened. The other kids had told their parents, and the parents and members of the tribe made a stern rule that no one should go and camp out in the woods anymore without parental supervision. \n\nFor many long years, the experience stayed with the elder’s grandpa. He had kids and had told the elder’s dad about the experience. And then his dad told him, and his grandpa also told him too. He wanted to tell his grandchildren every chance he could get. Don’t go into the forest alone. According to the elder, every once in a while his granddad would have him and his kids look out at the forest nearby the reservation on windy days. The elder said he could never be sure, but if he looked closely enough, some of the trees looked extra white. And they swayed and moved in ways they shouldn't have. He could swear one of those trees was walking. \n\nApparently, the grandpa had kept that photo he had taken of the creature. He had it developed as proof of what happened to him and those boys. He used to show it to kids to warn them about making the same mistake. The elder showed us that picture to as he told his story. I have a picture of the photo here that the tribal elder let me take: \n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/zMjsj4B](https://imgur.com/gallery/zMjsj4B)\n\nNow obviously, I have no idea if the elder is just yanking our legs. The photo could be fake for all I know. The story too. But, there are lots of similar stories about such run-ins with the Kashehotapolo. I don’t think I'll ever really know the truth. It can't hurt to take his advice and be extra careful in the woods around this reservation though. These people were living here long before we ever arrived here after all. And even if it turns out to all be a bunch of hoo-ha, you gotta admit, it’s one damn good story.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11py9t0/the_worst_camping_trip_ive_ever_been_on/",
        "text": "I grew up in a relatively small town just outside the suburbs of Chicago. The neighborhood was pretty nice, and I often look back on those times fondly. Sometimes I drive through the neighborhood for a little nostalgic trip when I’m feeling down, and it never ceases to bring me joy whenever I see a little kid running along the very same sidewalk I used to scooter down.\n\nOne of the things me and my buddies loved doing during that tranquil time of our lives was walking to the nearby convenience store to load up on snacks. It was a little ways from our house, though, so our parents weren’t too keen on us going, but we often did anyway just for the hell of it. Strangely, we never got caught. Some of my fondest memories with my buddies happened outside that very store.\n\nRecently, however, the store closed down due to a lack of customers. It made sense, seeing as how the neighborhood itself was starting to lower in popularity. The store had also only ever been run by one man, Mr. Eisen. Mr. Eisen was a jolly old man. He treated all his customers with respect, and he sometimes got away with giving us free snacks and drinks when business was good and he could afford to do so. It broke my heart to learn that he also recently passed away, which made the closing of the store all the more depressing.\n\nNot long after the store’s closure, one of the more daring members of my friend group (who we’ll call John) called me. John was a big horror guy. He loved watching documentaries and TV shows about stuff like ghost hunting or playing really old horror games. He wanted to do a late-night camping trip at the store the following night (the building itself hadn’t been rented out or gutted by this point). At first I was hesitant, seeing as how I’m not exactly the type to break into restricted areas, but alas, John convinced me, and he prepared a list of things I might need: food, water, sleeping bags, the usual. Luckily one of my coworkers offered to cover my night shift, so I didn’t miss any work, but looking back, I wish I had taken that shift.\n\nAs I packed the following afternoon, I received a text from John asking to bring candles. He had seen a new type of ghost-summoning ritual, and he wanted to try it, but he didn’t have candles. I agreed, but only because I didn’t really believe in any of this ghost bologna. I didn’t expect anything to come of it, so I packed a couple of wax candles in some plastic bags and headed over.\n\nI arrived at the abandoned store at around 9pm, just after most of the cars got off of the road. John was already inside, and he motioned me in. As I looked around, I got a weird shudder– I assumed that being in the store while it looked like this was a kind of liminal experience. The memories definitely came flooding back, but it made me uneasy rather than nostalgic.\n\nJohn eventually turned to me and asked for my candles. I reached into my bag and handed them to him, to which he promptly placed them in a triangular shape and lit them one by one. He then turned to me and handed me some kind of monitoring device, and told me to tell him if it started beeping. So I did, and I watched. He began circling the triangle in salt from a bag, then said some kind of gibberish in another language. I wonder if he knows he looks like an idiot right now, I wondered.\n\nSuddenly, the monitor started to beep. I looked over to John and told him it was beeping, but he didn’t move a muscle. He just froze, not a single peep out of him. I figured he didn’t hear me, so I went and shook his shoulder. “Hey,” I said. “It’s beeping, dude.” No movement. I went around to look at his face. He was stuck in a ghost-cold expression of fear, like he had seen some heinous crime be committed right in front of him.\n\nSuddenly, the lights of the store flickered on, and John fell to the floor. Catching him in midair, I attempted to shake him awake, but he was out cold…literally. His skin was ice cold, almost like he was dead, but his chest still moved up and down. I laid him on the ground and pulled out the hunting knife I had brought. I had originally brought it for carving something into the wall to leave one final mark on this place, but unfortunately it was now a self-defense weapon.\n\nWalking over to the breaker, I noticed that the master switch was off. I didn’t know if there was a second breaker or if the store was somehow getting power from some secondary backup generator, but regardless, I flipped it on. This promptly turned the lights off, and I kept it that way so as to avoid the police showing up to a fully lit, abandoned store with two random teenagers in it.\n\nI went and picked up John’s things, and then picked up John. I was about to walk out of the store when I heard a click from the back. Dropping John, I pulled my knife and yelled into the pitch-black. “Who’s there?!” I yelled, receiving no response. At this point I was genuinely creeped out. I stowed my knife and picked up John, and went to push open the door.\n\nThe door was locked.\n\nFrom the outside.\n\n“Oh, fuck you,” I compained to no one. Looking around I spotted an emergency crowbar in a glass case labeled “EMERGENCIES ONLY” in bright, red text. Breaking the glass, I picked it up and attempted to break one of the windows. I swung as hard as I could, but the glass would not break. We were stuck inside.\n\nI thought about calling the police, but I didn’t want to have to explain to them why we were there, so I decided against it. I placed the crowbar on the ground along with John, and sat down next to the door.\n\nAfter about five minutes, John woke up in a panic. “We need to get out of here, now!” He screamed, pushing at the door. When he eventually looked down and saw me not helping him I assumed he had realized the door wasn’t going to open.\n\n\n“What’s the rush, Mr. Brave and Bold?” I scoffed. “Too scared of a little dark?”\n\n“You don’t understand,” he said. “If we don’t get out, he’s going to-”\n\nSuddenly, a loud crash came from the back of the store. I grabbed the crowbar and handed it to John. “Freeman it up, smartass. You have the point.” He gulped, and we both walked towards the sound.\n\nAs we walked by, I noticed some of the items in the store had been moved. Cups were in the toy aisle, notebooks were in refrigerators– it was a very strange detail, considering I didn’t remember when they had moved.\n\nSuddenly, John screamed and dropped the crowbar, darting for the door. I turned towards him, then towards where he had been looking, and I realized why he had run. Standing there was a tall figure, with pure white eyes and a smile wider than my own hand. It stared down at me for a second or two, before reaching down and picking me up with a long, black tentacle.\n\nI took out my knife and stabbed the tentacle, setting me free, and ran. I ran after John, trying to keep up. Luckily, the force of John slamming into the glass window seemed to finally bust it, and he rolled out into the parking lot. I followed suit, and as we both got into my car, the figure began hovering towards us, a loud, ear-piercing screech along with it. The second my car started, I floored the gas and swerved out of the parking lot into the street. We didn’t care if the cops caught us anymore. We just needed to run.\n\nWe drove at top speed for about 20 minutes before pulling to a curb. I slumped back into my seat, and John did the same. “What the FUCK was that, John?” I screamed. “You could’ve had us KILLED!”\n\nHe turned to look at me, and then started to cry. “Fuck, man…” he said, slumping further into his chair. I sat up straight and sighed, staring at the road.\n\nThen, a tap on my window.\n\n“Come on back, boys. We haven’t even had a proper conversation.”\n\nI turned slowly to look. It had the voice of Mr. Eisen, but the figure was anything but. I finally got a glimpse of it in the short second my nerves were nulled out from the adrenaline.\n\nIt was a tall figure, no doubt. It stood on two slender legs stretching higher than my car. Its torso and head were made entirely from what looked like rotten meat, and its face was the same; its eyes pierced into my soul, and its smile shook me to my very core.\n\n\nI slammed on the gas, flying away at breakneck speeds. The figure did not move, only stared off at us as we flew off into the darkness. I made several sharp turns and eventually got onto a highway. It was then I realized John had passed out, and I started towards the nearest emergency room.\n\nIt’s been about two or three weeks since that night. The police never caught us (thank GOD, that fact most likely saved their lives) and John ended up having a severe memory loss of the whole event…he’s back to his old self now. But something about that neighborhood makes me not want to go back to it at night.\n\nNot now that I know something’s lurking there.",

        "title": "In 1970, the state of Oregon blew up a beached whale. They lied about the reason why",
        "author": "JLGoodwin1990",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11py4vq/in_1970_the_state_of_oregon_blew_up_a_beached/",
        "text": "Many of you reading this may be too young to remember the exploding whale incident that occurred in Oregon in the late fall of 1970. Heck, I’m fairly certain that quite a few of you weren’t even alive yet. So, I’ll give you the basic overview. On November 9th, 1970, a forty-five foot long sperm whale washed ashore on the beach near Florence. For three days, it sat there, drawing spectators and local government officials alike. After the first day or so, people were warned to stay away from it. The official reasoning given, was that there was concern that curious onlookers might climb on top of the carcass and fall in, in addition to the putrid stench that overtook the entire beach, and the threat of the body bursting. In less than two days, the Oregon State Highway Division was called in to dispose of it. They consulted with the Navy and many munitions experts, and came to the conclusion that the best way to treat it, would be like a boulder, and use dynamite to blow it up. And, on November 12th, with local and state news watching, they did just that, using half a ton of TNT, and creating one hell of an explosion which sent chunks of whale and sand over 100 feet in the air, even crushing in the roof of a nearby parked car.\n\nThat’s the official story, of course. It’s all a load of hogwash, though. I know, because I made the mistake of getting too close to it one night. Myself…and Harvey. I’m getting a little ahead of myself, though. Let me back up. I was just a youngster back then, no more than eleven years old. I lived with my folks in Florence, which, back then, was much smaller, and in my opinion, a much nicer place to live than it is today. I was sitting in the kitchen, waiting for my mother to finish making me waffles and eggs before being taken to school, when my father entered, having just stepped away to receive a phone call. “What’d they want, Gordon?” my mother asked, turning to face us, causing her black and white checkered apron to swirl slightly on her waist with a spatula in her hand. My father grunted as he sat back down at the table. “Darndest thing, actually. Apparently, a sperm whale managed to beach itself out on the sand. They want me and a few others to go out and take a look at it before it starts to cause a nuisance” Dad worked for the local government, specifically in the area of maintaining the beaches and parks for both locals and tourists alike. “Can you take me over to see it?” I asked excitedly. It had been years since a whale had washed ashore here, and I wanted to finally see what my father had spoken about dealing with once or twice before.\n\nBut he simply shook his head. “Afraid not, kiddo”, he said, tousling my hair with his hand, “This is grown up business, and a little too dangerous to have you around” He began to chow down on the eggs and bacon my mother brought to him. “Maybe next time” he finished, speaking around bites of his food. I hung my head, feeling slightly dejected as I began to eat my waffles and eggs. When I got to school, many of the kids were talking excitedly about the whale. “I heard that it’s huge, black, and stinks to high heaven” Kirstie, the girl who sat next to me in math class said to her friend in front of her. “Ewww” her friend retorted, scrunching up her nose and causing both girls to break into a fit of giggling, which was fast silenced by the teacher clearing his throat. \n\nLater, as I sat in the lunchroom, eating pizza squares and carrot sticks, my best friend Harvey came over and sat down, along with the two others in our friend group. “So, has your dad said anything about the whale?” Michael asked, using the sleeve of his shirt to wipe pizza sauce from his face. I shrugged my shoulders. “All he said was it washed ashore, and it was too dangerous for me to go see it” I admitted. Harvey let out a loud belch after downing his chocolate milk, earning a huge laugh from our group, and a stern look of disapproval from the lunchroom monitor in the back. “I heard that it’s already attracted a huge flock of seagulls and crows around it” he said after settling back. Gregory chimed in. “Yeah, and that it’s covered in slime!” We all looked at him and laughed. “You really need to stop reading those dime store pulp novels from your parents’ bookshelf, man” Harvey said, then leaned it close, all of us doing the same.\n\n“*I* heard that it has super sharp and bright white teeth. That’s what my older cousin Janice said when she stopped by this morning. Her and her boyfriend had gone for a walk on the beach when they saw it” Gregory looked at him. “Wait, what was your cousin doing with her boyfriend out there so early?” he asked. Harvey made a face. “Probably doing some of that gross romantic stuff” he said with a tone of disgust, each of us scrunching up our faces in a similar manner. “That’s not the point, though”, he continued, “The point is, none of us has seen a beached whale before” He looked around at each of us, a small, sly smile beginning to etch across his face. “So, what I’m thinking is, why don’t we go down there after our parents go to bed, and look at it? Maybe even take some pictures with it!” He pointed at me. “Alan, didn’t your dad just buy you that camera a few weeks ago?” I nodded my head. “I mean, yeah, but-“ I began, but he cut me off. “Then why don’t we make an adventure out of it and go and see it?” he pressed, looking around hopefully at all of us. Michael spoke up. “I can’t do it tonight, Harv. My parents are going out to dinner and leaving me with a babysitter. You *know* I can’t sneak past Michelle if my life depended on it”\n\nHarvey let out an annoyed snort. “Fine, maybe not tonight, but what about tomorrow night?” he asked. He looked at Gregory. “What’dya say, man?” he asked him. Gregory sat a little lower in his seat, trying to make himself smaller. “I don’t know man”, he said quietly, “If Mom or Dad catch me sneaking out that far, I’ll get grounded for life” This time, Harvey let out a disgusted sound. “You are such a little chickenshit” he spat. We all gasped at the swear; each of us had heard our respective father’s let out the occasional curse word around us, but after I’d made the mistake of shouting “Damn it!” when I stubbed my toe trying to fly up the back porch steps, and was rewarded with a bar of soap in my mouth for it, none of us really ever said them again. Harvey, being the member of our group who liked to break the rules the most, clearly did not care. He raised his hands and shook them in a mocking way at us. “Ooooh” he said, before lowering them and looking at me. “What about you, Alan?” he asked. “Will you come with me tomorrow night?” He leaned in and grinned. “Or are *you* too much of a scaredy cat to come with me?” I felt my cheeks grow hot and glared at my friend. “I am not a scaredy cat, and you know it” I growled defensively at him.\n\n“Who was the one who went into that abandoned house last year?” I continued. “Who was the one who climbed into that sewer pipe after everyone else chickened out? It was me!” I sat up straight, trying to sound as unaffected and tough as I could. “Then come with me!” Harvey said, looking at our other two friends. “And show these two chickens how to become men, instead of staying little boys” His comment earned mutters and annoyed glances his way, but he was focused on me. He knew he had me, and so did I. He knew I hated being called scared or a baby, and I would always take the bait when he used the line. *So darn gullible in retrospect.* Finally, I looked him dead in the eye. “Fine, I’ll go with you” I said. “Yes!” he said, grinning like he had just walked into Woolworth and been told by his parents that he could choose whatever he wanted for lunch. With a root beer float. “So here’s what we’ll do” he said, lowering his voice to barely above a whisper. “Meet me in back of your house in the alley at eleven tomorrow night. We’ll bike across the bridge and to the dunes where the whale is. Bring your camera, and we’ll get proof we were there!” I was about to answer him when the bell rang, signaling that lunch was over. He shot me a thumbs up as he stood up, dumped his leftovers in the trash and returned his tray. Michael and Gregory patted me on the shoulders as they passed by me. “Good luck, man” they both said, leaving me to stare after them and wonder what on earth I’d just agreed to.\n\nI spent the entire rest of the afternoon until the end of school staring out the window, unable to concentrate on schoolwork. All I could focus on was what I was going to do with Harvey tomorrow night. When Mom picked me up at three, I barely said anything to her about how my day went; Instead, I just looked out the window of her station wagon at the Siuslaw River, and the hulking shape of the dunes on the other side. When my father got home that evening for dinner, I ran over to him as he sat in his recliner watching television. “So what happened?” I pestered him as he attempted to watch the news. He looked at me and gave a tired smile. “It’s big, alright”, he said, yawning slightly, “And it smells like four week old garbage in the dump. They’re unsure of how to get rid of it” And with that, he patted me on the head and went back to watching the screen. At dinner that evening, he spoke a little more about it to my mother when she asked about it. “You know, it’s strange, darling”, he said as he devoured the casserole she had made. “Normally, this would be a local matter. But, for some reason they called in the Highway Division, along with some bigwigs from the state coast guard and naval bases” \n\n“It’s stranger, because I swear I saw one or two men studying it like it was some kind of specimen in a beaker” he added, before being shushed by my mother and told to finish telling him once “little ears”, code word for me, had gone to bed. As I lay in bed that evening, attempting to fall asleep, and instead gazing around my room at the Clint Eastwood and Steve McQueen movie posters on my wall, I thought about what he’d said. *Why would such important people want to look at a dead whale?* I thought. *What could possibly be so special about it?* I shrugged it off, then turned to face the wall as I felt the first tendrils of sleep begin to seep into me.\n\nThe next day went by in a blur. The words of my teachers and friends echoed in my head, and went straight in one ear and out the other, bouncing around in my brain like a beach ball, but never sticking. When Mom brought me home, I told her I was going to play in the backyard for a little while. “Go upstairs and change your clothes, then” she called as I took my books upstairs. “I’ll whoop your sorry behind if you get grass stains all over your nice new school clothes!” I did as she said, changing into a pair of jeans and a t-shirt, before discreetly grabbing my father’s latest present to me- a brand new Kodak Instamatic camera, and a handful of flash cubes, and heading out the back door. In our backyard sat an old, rusting Ford Model T which had belonged to my grandfather. My father always spoke about restoring it in his memory, but never seemed to find the time to. Making sure my bike was leaning against the side of it where it couldn’t be seen by my parents, I slipped into the cab, and hid the camera and flash cubes underneath the seat, before stepping back out and throwing a baseball at our fence for a few hours.\n\nAfter dinnertime, I watched a movie being shown on the TV with my father in the living room, I believe it was *20,000 Leagues Under The Sea*, and then kissed both of them goodnight and went to bed, pretending to fall asleep. I listened, and at around ten, heard them climb the stairs and shut the door to their bedroom. I waited another twenty minutes to make sure they were asleep, then threw back the covers, revealing I still had on jeans, sneakers and a shirt, grabbed my coat off the hook behind my door, and crept downstairs, careful not to accidentally cause the floorboards on the stairs to creak. I slipped out the back door, turning up my collar at the chilly fall night air, and breathed in deeply. “Ahh” I whispered at the smell of the ocean wafting over the dunes and into town, then crept across the backyard to the darkened shape of the truck. Reaching through the open window, I retrieved the camera and flash cubes, along with a flashlight I’d swiped from under the kitchen sink, grabbed my bicycle, and wheeled it out into the alley where Harvey was waiting.\n\n“Well, did you bring the camera?” he whispered, and I held it up where it could be seen in the yellow streetlight over our heads. He nodded, then pressed a finger to his lips and signaled for me to follow him, hopping onto his bike and pedaling away. I hopped on my own, and after flicking on the handlebar mounted light to guide my way, pedaled after him. The town seemed extremely eerie at night with all the stores closed, and the houses dark. It felt like biking through a ghost town. *Or a nightmare* I thought, before shaking my head. The last thing I wanted to do was scare myself into turning around. Harvey would never let me live it down. We passed through intersection after intersection, always keeping an eye out for other people. At one point, we ducked behind a fence as a police car came slowly lumbering down the road, waiting for it to pass before continuing on. Soon enough, we passed over the bridge leading out of town and towards the dunes, the air growing colder and the smell of saltwater growing thicker as we approached our destination. \n\nFinally, we came to a point where we couldn’t bike any further due to the sand catching our tires, and chose instead to hide our bikes among the far side of the first dunes. Turning on both of our flashlights, we let the yellow beams guide our way as we walked to the beach. “So, what do you think it’s gonna look like?” he asked, his voice filled with obvious excitement and glee. I shrugged my shoulders before realizing he couldn’t see it in the dark. “I don’t know. It’s been a day or two. Dad always told me the birds start eating it by now. So, I think it’ll have a lot of holes in it” He let out a low whistle. “Cool” he said. “I wonder if I could stick my hand inside it?” I groaned. “Don’t do that, Harvey, you’ll never get the smell off you, and then your folks *will* know we’ve been out here. He scoffed. “Like I give a damn” he muttered, and I shook my head simply. After another five minutes, we both stopped. “Ugh, what is that smell?!” Harvey exclaimed, covering his nose and mouth with his hand. “My guess, we’re close” I said through my own covering hand. “Man, that stinks!” he said, then continued leading the way.\n\nI started following him, when I accidentally walked into his back. Nearly crashing to the sand, I raised my light to shine on the back of his head. “What’s the deal?” I hissed as my face throbbed with pain. But he shushed me, turning around and lowering my light. “There’s someone there!” he hissed back. “Kill your light!” We both clicked ours off and listened. He was right; I could hear hushed voices coming from up the beach in the direction we were heading. “Shhh” I heard Harvey whisper, and then saw him crouch forwards. For a moment, I thought about just turning around and leaving. *I don’t want to get in trouble. Not where Mom and Dad are going to take me to Disney Land for Christmas Vacation in a few weeks!* But I couldn’t just leave Harvey there by himself, so I reluctantly followed him. When I reached him, I stared out at what he was looking at over the dune.\n\nI could see the dark shape of the ocean from here. It sat less than a few hundred yards from where we lay on our stomachs. We also finally saw the whale. It lay on its side, about ten feet from the water’s edge, its shape hulking and gigantic. White lined ridges spread out the top of its back, while the rest of its shape was nothing but smooth blackness. It was easy to tell these features, because currently, there was a light on it, a bright one. Behind it, I could see two or three figures standing and talking amongst themselves. Then they began to walk towards us. “Down!” I whispered, and Harvey and I made ourselves as small as possible behind the dune. The sound of footsteps digging in and kicking up the sand approached, and I heard a snippet of their conversation as they passed by me. “It’s incredible!” I heard a man say, “Two days out of the water and still maintaining vital signs. Combine this with the alterations, and I think we’ve discovered a whole new species! One far more predatory and dangerous than we’ve ever seen before. We’ve got to get on the horn and get this information out!”\n\nThey drew further away, and their conversation dimmed and grew unintelligible again. The two of us stood up. “What were they talking about?” I asked, gazing towards the darkness where they’d gone. “Who cares?” Harvey said, shaking the sand off his coat and pants. “It means we have a chance to get the pictures, come on!” And with that, he began running down the last dune to the giant, dark form on the sand. I followed, slower though; something about the way the men had spoken had made me feel a twinge of uneasiness. Still, I plodded behind my friend towards the shape. As I drew closer, it rose higher and higher above my head, until it seemed to tower over me like one of the buildings I saw when my parents took me to Portland.\n\nHarvey drew close to the side of the creature. The smell was overpowering now, and I forced myself to breathe through my mouth to keep from gagging. He reached out towards it. “Harvey, don’t!” I whispered urgently. “Nothing’s going to happen, *Alan*”, he said, putting a mocking tone as he said my name, “its dead, after all, remember?” And before I could say any more, he placed his hand on it. Immediately, he drew it back, his face a look of disgust. “Eww!” he exclaimed. “What?” I asked, afraid of what he’d say. “It’s…its slimy and cold!” he said, then chuckled. “I don’t believe it, Gregory was right!” He chuckled again, then waved for me to follow him around the other side. Before I stepped after him, I noticed something odd. *The birds have barely touched it*. I followed after him slowly, and as I drew closer, I heard him gasp. “Holy shit! Alan, come look at this!”\n\nWalking quickly, I rounded the edge and saw what he’d seen. The whale’s mouth was huge; it yawned before us like the opening of a cave, its teeth looking like the stalactites and stalagmites at the entrance. It was wide enough that we easily could have walked inside. “Wow” I breathed, staring into the blackness beyond. “No joke!” Harvey said excitedly, “It looks exactly like the whale from *Moby Dick*!” He ran away from me, down to the other end. “And the tail is huge! It’s as wide as a car!” he called. I heard him run back towards me, and he reappeared in the light behind us. “You’ve got to take a picture of me in front of the mouth, Alan!” he exclaimed. “That would be the ultimate picture to have. All the kids in school would think I’m the coolest kid there!” I glanced around, looking to make sure the men weren’t coming back, then pulled my camera and a flash bulb out of my coat pocket. “Alright, but just a few pictures, and then we get out of here. Before *they* come back” I hooked a thumb back towards where they had gone.\n\n“Yeah, yeah, whatever, that’s fine, just take the picture!” he insisted, moving to stand towards the edge of the mouth. I looked down and pushed the flash cube into the slot at the top of the camera, then moved away about ten feet, to make sure I got as much of the whale in the shot as well as him. As I raised the viewfinder to my eye, a strange feeling came over me. It was almost the same feeling I had when I would turn to find my parents watching me out the window of the house. It was a feeling of being watched. But when I looked away from the camera, I saw nothing. Nobody. “What’re you waiting for?” Harvey hissed. “Take the damn picture!” Shaking my head, I again raised the camera, centered the viewfinder on him, then pressed down on the shutter button. The area for a split second lit up even brighter by the flash from the cube, and the burning smell that would come with it followed a second after.\n\n“Take another!” he insisted, bending his arms up the way bodybuilders did and striking a pose. I did as he asked, but as I pressed the shutter button, something above him caught my head. High over both of our heads, I could just barely see the edge of one of the whale’s eyes. It was just a tiny glimpse. But, something about it seemed….*off*. As my eyes adjusted to the darkness again, Harvey picked up a piece of driftwood from the sand, then held it out like it was a spear he was about to throw. “One more!” he said, chuckling as he attempted to look like Captain Ahab. I sighed, still feeling like I was being watched, but obediently raised the camera to my eye and centered on my friend.\n\nThat’s when I noticed it. A flicker of motion from where I’d seen the edge of the eye. I hesitated, staring at the scene through the viewfinder, noting that there was more white there than there had been before. *Did its eye just move?* I lowered the camera. “Uh, Harvey”, I said tentatively, “You may want to get over here” He looked at me, annoyed. “I will”, he said, raising the driftwood again, “After you take the *damn* picture!” I was about to speak again when I heard shouting coming from off to the side, frantic and out of breath. I turned, and saw the three men who had passed by us sprinting towards us, arms waving over their heads like they were trying to signal an overhead airplane. For a second, I couldn’t make out what they were saying, then it became clear. “Get away from it! For the love of God, get away from it!” came a man’s cry.\n\n“Harvey, we’ve gotta go!” I shouted, no longer trying to be discreet. I turned and saw him drop the piece of driftwood, a panicked look covering his face. What happened next happened in a fraction of a second. One moment, he was there, beginning to run towards me. The next, something flashed out from inside the whale’s mouth as quick as a lightning bolt. I didn’t get a good look at it, but, from the little I did, it….it looked like…*a tongue*. But not one I’d ever seen before. This looked like it split apart into three pieces, and it looked as though the surface of it was covered in small, sharp hooks. In that same instant, they wrapped around Harvey with the fluidity of boa constrictor, and he was gone, yanked back into the mouth and down its throat. He never even had time to cry out. That’s when the men reached me.\n\nOne grabbed me around the waist and threw me as far as they could, back towards the lights they had set up. I fell hard on my side, the air driven from my lungs. When I stared up, I felt the color drain from my face. The whale was moving, thrashing around on the sand in a frenzied attempt to reach its next meal. And it had found it. The man who had thrown me had been snagged in the clutches of its tongue, and with the same speed it had taken my friend, yanked him back into its gullet. He, however, had managed to let out the beginnings of a scream; it was choked off as he disappeared inside. I scrambled to my feet, unable to keep myself from crying, snot running down from my nose. “Run, kid!” one of the remaining two men shouted at me, waving at me with his arms. I took a last look at the thrashing creature on the sand, and saw its eye. Its *diamond patterned* eye, filled with a mix of colors from black to red. The eye focused, and locked on to me, and I felt my pants dampen as I pissed myself in fear. Screaming, I turned and took the man’s advice, running for my life back towards where my bike lay hidden. \n\nI barely remember getting home that night. The frantic pedaling back into town and home, along with dropping my bike into my backyard and getting back into the house are all a blur. All I know is, the next thing I remember was my mother shaking me awake. “Alan, honey, I need you to focus and tell me something” she said seriously. “Have you seen Harvey since school yesterday?” I didn’t know what to say to her; I *couldn’t* bring myself to say anything, so instead I simply shook my head. She looked at me for a second, then nodded and went back downstairs, telling me it was time to get ready to go to school. As I got out of bed, I realized I’d dropped my camera when I ran.\n\nThe entire rest of the day, my mind couldn’t focus on anything but the memories of the previous night. My parents and my teachers all noticed it, but they chocked it up to worrying about my missing friend. When Michael and Gregory approached me in the cafeteria, I said nothing when they asked what happened, if we’d gone out there. I just felt numb. I kept replaying over and over in my head that image. That image of my friend being snatched and swallowed whole. It was a sight I would see for years in my dreams, waking me up wearing sheen of cold sweat on my skin. When I got home that day, my father was looking at me strangely, and also disapprovingly. “Alan, when I went out to work today, I was approached by one of the men working with the Highway Division”, he said sternly. “He said he found *this* lying in the sand out there” He held something out to me, and I felt my heart begin to race as he held out my camera. My camera which had my *name* written on the back. He continued. “What have I told you about taking care of your valuables, young man? This camera isn’t cheap, and you can’t just leave it wherever when we go to the beach, like we did last weekend” I looked up at him in surprise. He handed the camera to me. “Just be lucky that it was returned to you, and don’t ever pull this again, do you understand me?”\n\nI could do nothing but nod my head, lowering it so he couldn’t see my pale face. He turned and walked away from me, and I waited until he was in the kitchen before reaching and opening the back of the camera. Inside, it was empty. The film cartridge had been taken from it. Obviously by someone who didn’t want anything coming back to me. I never heard from those men again. They must have deemed me as not a threat, someone who wouldn’t speak about what I saw that night. So, they left me alone, with my returned, empty camera as enough of a message.\n\nA day or so later, I sat on the living room carpet with my father behind me in his recliner. We both watched the news reporter, interviewing members of the Highway Division, as well as members of the public. Who had been kept a quarter mile away from the black shape rising from the sand and waves. I couldn’t help but shudder at the sight of it, my eyes filling with tears for my lost friend. A few moments later, everyone pulled back, and the explosives were detonated, sending huge chunks of it into the air. The reporter ended the segment, interviewing spectators again and telling viewers that the remaining chunks would be buried in the sand. I got up and walked out of the living room. They hadn’t blown it up for the reasons they’d said. They never blew up any whale that beached itself ashore again, not even when over forty beached themselves at once, nine years later. They blew it up because it was the only way to destroy that *monster*.\n\nThey never found a trace of Harvey. His parents spent over a year trying to locate him. His face ended up on posters, and even the back of the milk cartons. I knew they’d never find him. And any trace of him was obliterated when that explosion went off.\n\nI’m sixty-four now. A few years ago, they aired a fifty year anniversary segment about the whale. Or, *whatever* that whale looking creature was. And it made me remember all the repressed memories I’ve tried to forget. I tried to forget again, but I cannot. So, I’ve decided, for the betterment of my mental health, as well as, possibly, a way to soothe the scars on my soul, to post this here. I know nobody will believe it. But, that’s okay. The truth is out there now. Harvey’s *true* fate is out there, though his parents are now long dead.\n\nTwo things keep picking away at my brain, though. Even in my advanced age, I shudder to imagine, if it was that dangerous beached on land, what it would be like to meet it under the waves. And two, and this is perhaps what has kept me out of the ocean for all these decades. \n\nHow many *more* of those things are out there?",

        "text": "I looked at my phone. Still sitting in bed, I shook my head in disbelief. It couldn't be... Yet there it was, a new text message from Abby. The time stamp read \"4:42 am\", a time I knew all too well. The time that I found Abby dead. It happened 7 months ago. We had gotten into a pretty bad fight, and she decided to sleep on the couch for the night. I reluctantly agreed. I hated sleeping alone, but we were both stubborn hotheads and I knew if we were next to each other, we'd continue fighting for the rest of the night. I had fallen asleep somewhere around 1 am, and was sleeping peacefully, until a loud scream awoke me with a start. It wasn't the scream of Abby, but the scream of something else entirely. The scream, if you can even call it that, was of something primal, something otherworldly. I rushed downstairs to find a site that has haunted my dreams to this day. Abby, well what was left of her, was lying in a mangled mess on the floor. There was blood painted everywhere, and I immediately threw up at the site. The front door was wide open, and the red trail led straight out into the night, presumably taking Abby's bottom half along for the ride, as it wasn't left behind. \n\nI haven't had a good night's sleep since. I'm still in shock over what happened. The police told me that an animal had broken in and attacked my wife in her sleep. I told them about the unearthly scream I had heard from whatever it was, but they brushed it off. They didn't seem too concerned about the situation at all, but to be fair, what could they do? There was no person they could arrest, as there was no way any person could have committed such an act. I got no closure over the situation as I still have no idea what happened. Which made it worse when I got this text... It was a short message, but one that chilled me to the core. \"She made a lovely snack.\" \n\n*What the hell?!* I thought to myself. This had to be some kind of sick joke. I stared blankly at the screen not knowing what to do. I eventually decided to message whoever this was back, as it was probably just some asshole who found Abby's phone which was in the pocket of her jeans that night. \"Who is this?\" I decided on, it was cliche, I know, but it was all I could think of. It didn't take long for the person on the other end to reply. \n\n\"Excellent question but allow me to ask you one first.\" It said, \"Why didn't you save her? She was so helpless, so innocent, so vulnerable. You could have saved her. She screamed for you, and you did nothing. Why?\"\n\n\"YOU SON OF A BITCH!!\" I screamed, when I noticed it started to type again. I waited to see what it had to say. \"Now, Daniel, that's not very nice. Do you kiss your wife with that mouth... Oh wait, no. You don't.\" I was seething at this point, but the anger then melted into fear as I replied to the stranger. \n\n\"How did you know I was cursing you?\" I asked, my hands shaking as I looked around my dark room, only illuminated by the faint glow of the moonlight. The stranger didn't respond as quickly this time. I sat in my bed dreading to see the 3 dots displayed when someone is typing. However, I didn't get them. Instead, I received a picture message. It was a picture of a door. A door I immediately recognized as my bedroom door. My heart raced in my chest. I looked towards the door, expecting it to swing open at any second, but it didn't. \n\nMy phone notified me of another text message, and I jumped from pure terror. I looked down at my phone still resting in my shaky hands. The message, as I expected was from Abby's number. \"Don't worry, Daniel. I'm not going to kill you. Actually, I'm just here to deliver a gift to you. When you done being scared come outside the door and look what I brought you. I promise, you'll love it.\" My stomach was in knots. I looked around the room, half expecting to see some grotesque monster. But, alas, I didn't. \n\nI turned on the bedside lamp and waiting for another 10 minutes or so before I lifted the covers, nervously got out of bed, and walked to the door. I stood in front of it for a moment. Contemplating if I really wanted to open it. I've seen many horror movies, and I knew that it was a bad idea to do so. I eventually gave into temptation and grabbed the cold doorknob. I slowly turned it but hesitated to open the door. *Come on Dan. Quit being scared. This is just someone playing a sick prank.* I thought to myself, even though I didn't even believe the foolish words rolling off my tongue. I yanked the door open. What I saw was not what I expected. It wasn't a monster. It wasn't the missing lower half of my wife... It was a piece of paper folded up lying on the wooden floor. I knelt down and picked it up, slowly unfolding it to reveal its contents. It was very sloppy, and nearly illegible. I eventually was able to distinguish what was written. \"***SEE YOU TOMORROW NIGHT\".*** \n\nThese events occurred last night. I'm writing this at 10:37 pm as a desperate plea for help. I know it's coming for me. My phone just vibrated. I'm scared the even look at it. Help me. Please. Help me.",

        "text": " With a pleased grin on my face, I slid my worksheet across the table. Under question 3.2 I had scribbled an unflattering caricature of our balding graduate student instructor. He had a tendency to drone in a monotone, Eastern European accent - leading to a pervasive sense of boredom the entire hourthirty-minutee class.   \n\n\nLuckily, I had Jane to endure the struggle with me. She was beautiful. Not an understated “oh she’s pretty” kind of beautiful, a kind of beauty that could invoke lust and love with just a glance. I had no business speaking to this woman, but by happenstance, we were seated across from one another. \n\nOn the first day of class, she initiated conversation with me. I was much too timid to utter the first word. From that moment onward, we trauma bonded from the relentless mental torture our professor bestowed upon us. \n\nJane giggled at my shitty illustration and scribbled one back of a grizzly suicide scene of a woman’s brain scattered across a wall from a shotgun blast to the head. The cartoon was captioned “Things I’d rather be doing than being here.” I could not contain my uproarious laughter. \n\nThe glasses-adorned, toupee-needing professor went dead silent and gnarled through his teeth “Focus. Please.” Jane and I both made a shocked and embarrassed face at one another followed by an inaudible giggle. \n\nAs I was packing up, Jane tapped me on the shoulder and with an ear-to-ear smile asked, “Whatcha up to Friday night?” I was caught off guard. I had no plans. \n\nWell - I did have plans. I was going to call my mom, then my grandmother, then watch hours of podcasts accompanied by a pint of ice cream of my choosing. Not wanting to sound like a loser, I squeaked, “Uhhh yeah I was thinking maybe I was gonna take it easy, have a chill night. Maybe go with a few friends to bars or something. Haven’t really planned anything yet.” Then she inched closer and said, “Well… if you do decide to go out, I’m going to Phi Gam’s Heaven and Hell party, maybe I’ll see you there.” She finished her statement with the tiniest resemblance of a wink. I was shitting myself but had to collect my emotions in a matter of milliseconds, “Haha yeah, I have friends in Phi Gam. I may stop by if I’m feeling a little devilish.” Stupid - so fucking stupid - that pun was so dumb. \n\nShe chuckled and just above a whisper said, “See you there.” I ran back to my apartment, barely containing my excitement. I sprinted past students on the walkway, and some religious fanatic screaming slurs and condemning everyone to hell. It looked more contentious than usual, but I couldn’t be bothered with the momentary entertainment.\n\nWhen I walked in the door, my roommate Miles was playing Xbox. He took one look at me and quipped, “What’s got you so giddy? They giving free BJs to virgins in the dining hall today?” Usually, I’d respond with something more vulgar, but all the dopamine made me unable to channel the necessary rage, “Nothing, just a nice day or something.” “Yeah.. uh-huh,” he uttered with a suspicious glance. “Miles.. um do you think you could maybe work something out and get me on the list for Phi Gam Friday?” His face lit up, and he immediately put his controller down, “You’re fucking with me.” I tried to explain myself, “Nah man, yknow it’s second semester. Time to start cutting loose.” His suspicious glance was back, and to get it to go away I began word barfing. “Yknow t’s been a tough week, I just wanna go out and have a little fun.” I said wringing my hands. \n\n“It’s a bitch, isn’t it.” He said smugly. “No. Miles. It’s not a ‘bitch’” I muttered defeatedly, knowing I’m a terrible liar. He sprung to his feet, “Awwww David finally had his little sexual awakening and wants to explore women’s bodies!” I told him to shut the fuck up. He laughed and patted me on the shoulder, “Yes buddy, of course, I can put you on the list.”\n\nFriday rolled around, I debated between a white button-down with exposed chest and a tight red shirt. I opted for the button-down. \n\nAround 10 p.m. I began my walk off campus to the Phi Gam house. Music could be heard from around the block, and angry freshmen complained about how the bouncers were pricks. This party was one of the biggest and most exclusive of the year. I strolled up to the bouncer with confidence, “David Gutner.” I said with all the gusto in my chest. The brawny man looked me up and down, he mumbled, “You’re on the list… but are you supposed to be here?” I laughed nervously, “Yes of course.” “Suit yourself,” he grumbled and granted me entry. \n\nI walked down a rickety staircase into the cramped basement. The party had just begun but was already filling up. In the front of the basement was a large DJ stand and 3 industrial coolers of jungle juice. The rest of the space was a large dance floor with elevated platforms. \n\n“You actually fucking made it. Well, I’ll be damned. Good thing I’m not a betting man didn’t think there was a chance in hell you’d actually make it out.” Miles exclaimed to me, obviously trying to impress the girl he was with through exaggerated motions and enthusiasm. “Well, I’m here,” I muttered at the ground. “Welp, good to see you, man. Drinks are up there, we got water in the back, but you won’t be needing that. Drink up, my man.” He patted me on the back and walked away.\n\nFor the next fifteen minutes, I milled around with a red solo cup I filled with water. I would’ve just taken a bottle, but I did not want Miles to catch me with a non-alcoholic drink.\n\n“Daviddddddd!” Jane screamed as she gave me a tight hug. I couldn’t contain my huge smile. We began chatting, talking forever about nothing. We were having the time of our lives. Out the corner of my eye, I saw one of the brothers of Phi Gam causing a scene. He was screaming obscenities, pushing, and throwing elbows. I didn’t think much of it. “Someone gotta cut that guy off,” I joked to Jane and she laughed. A few more minutes of flirtatious banter went by. I kept the jokes coming, but Jane was beginning to zone out. I assumed she was just becoming disinterested and a deep sadness enveloped me.\n\nSuddenly, one of Jane’s friends sprinted across the dance floor to Jane, “HELP ME PLEASE IT BURNS IT HURTS SO FUCKING -“ Before she could finish her sentence she began throwing up chunky, dark crimson blood. It didn’t just look like blood, there was large fleshy chunks within it. \n\nPanic set in, I began to become more aware of my surroundings. Everyone was moving and acting erratically. I screamed at the top of my lungs, but seemingly no one else was concerned with the dying girl at my feet. Across the sea of ravenous heads, I spotted one other guy who seemed as terrified as I. He sprinted up the basement stairs, within seconds he came tumbling down. He bashed his head multiple times and laid writhing in the floor. The bouncer came down the stairs.\n\n“HELP US! CALL 911 THIS GIRL IS DYING.” I cried out to the bouncer. My voice broke as I was screaming so intensely over the deafening music. The bouncer broke off a piece of the railing and bashed in the head of the man who attempted to escape. He then lurched back up the stairs, presumably leaving.\n\nI looked down at Jane, “We need to get the fuck out of here, take my hand.” As I began guiding her to the stairs, the belligerent brother from earlier blocked our exit. He was covered in blood and a lifeless stare in his eyes. He ripped Jane out of my grasp. He placed both his hands in her jaw and pulled separate directions. Jane’s jaw went flying onto the floor. He began animalistically eating what was left of her head. I shrieked, but couldn’t hear my own voice over the blaring music. Everyone in attendance was shouting gibberish. I began bawling. \n\nMiles approached me again, he had pieces of flesh and hair in his teeth. He stared me dead in the eye and tried to bite me. I forced my thumbs deep into his eye sockets until he was on the ground in pain. I stood panting in shock. \n\n“Get down.” A female voiced uttered to me. I looked at the ground and a girl covered in blood laid on a mound of bodies. “Get the fuck down or you’re going to die.” She angrily pushed through her teeth. I hit the ground as fast as I could. \n\nAfter three more minutes of chaos, the music cut out. Suddenly footsteps echoed down the basement stairs. Another guy who was curled in a ball in a corner popped to his feet. “THANK GOD THE POLICE ARE HERE, ITS SAFE THANK Y-“ a gunshot ended his exclamation. He collapsed to the ground. The figure emerged from the dark staircase and into the light of the dance floor, it was the bouncer. Behind him, more footsteps crept. Ten middle-aged people followed behind him. At the back was an old man. It was difficult to make out the details of his face, but it was obvious he was elderly by the way he walked. \n\nOver his shoulder, on his hunched back, rested a large sign. He crawled up to the DJ stand and picked up a microphone. He handed his sign to the bouncer who was now to his right on the DJ stand. The bouncer held the sign which read. “REPENT OR ENDURE AN ETERNITY OF HELL.” The old man tapped the microphone twice. The bouncer shot any cannibalistic students who attempted to approach the old man or his followers.\n\n“SINNERS. YOU HAVE REJECTED THY GOD. YOU HAVE REJECTED ETERNAL SALVATION FOR ETERNAL DAMNATION. YOU FORNICATERS, WHORES, SEED-SPILLING DEMONS. WHAT YOU ARE NOW IS WHAT IS WITHIN YOUR SOUL. ENJOY HELL ON EARTH AND INTO THE AFTERLIFE.” \n\nThe old man’s armed followers began to shoot into the crowd. Despite their impending doom, the students laughed and clawed at their own flesh and others. There was not an ounce of humanity in the human-filled room. I quietly sobbed, playing dead on the floor. \n\nAfter ten minutes of non-stop shooting. More shooting emerged from the staircase. A barrage of heavily armed SWAT and Police Officers rushed the basement. They killed every one of the followers of the old man. The old man got on his knees and they handcuffed him. He began laughing and screaming more religious rhetoric as he was forced up the stairs. \n\nWith a bullhorn they announced, “This is Duncansville police, emergency medical services are here to assist all injured persons. We are here to help.” \n\nI laid shaking, and uncontrollably sobbing on the floor. My mind was numb. All I could see was blood and dismembered bodies. Flesh laid randomly across the floor. The smell was so foul I gagged every time I took a second to breathe from sobbing. I ended up hyperventilating.\n\nI woke up in the hospital the next morning. My family was by my side, before I could even get my bearings the police came in to ask me questions about what happened. I had trouble remembering at that point, as I was still in shock. \n\nThe officers explained that a religious extremist group on campus has committed an act of domestic terror. They spiked the alcohol with a mixture of bath salts, lsd, and cyanide. This led to the erratic and violent behavior of the people who drink it, as well as their eventual deaths.\n\nI washed clumps of blood from my hair for weeks. Classes were canceled the last 8 weeks of the semester. That Summer I began therapy and worked through everything I experienced. Months later I returned to campus. I was still broken, but able to continue. \n\nAs I walked to class the first day, a man with a university shirt approached me on the quad and handed me a pamphlet. I looked down at the piece of paper in my hand that read only one word - REPENT.",

        "text": " \n\nSo, my father finally passed away. I say finally because he was very old and had been sick for a while. None of this was unexpected. \n\nWe moved him to a care facility near here a couple of years ago, so one of us could visit him on a daily basis. His house sat empty the entire time he was at the care facility. Now, we are tasked with emptying it out. \n\nWhat follows was included in some papers my wife found while going through his old filing cabinets. Based on what we know of our father’s early history before he met Mom, we all think that this was written by him and that the person described is himself. We are divided on whether this is fictional or real. It doesn’t have a title, just the date of “September 21st, 1981.” It was in a sealed envelope addressed to a paranormal researcher who was active in the 1990’s. It was never mailed, obviously.\n\n“A couple packs of fresh Tareyton cigarettes were what it took for me to get through a day at that lousy job. Every morning I’d get the doors unlocked, flip the Closed sign around to say Open, and turn on all the lights. That clunky, black rotary phone behind the counter would always ring when the clock on the wall showed eight fifty six. It was Juanita from the home office over in Waldorf, doing her daily check in, making sure she could tell management that their precious adult book store, just a few blocks down from the front gate of the Navy base, was open for business. After that, I’d go out back for the day’s first cigarette. The morning this all happened, my lighter stopped working.\n\nI got  finished with the Juanita call, then headed out to the alley behind the store. If anyone ever asked, I could say I was out there making sure there was no sign of an overnight burglary. Like I said, we were two blocks from the main gate to the base, and a lot of traffic in and out of that store was enlisted men. But a lot of the trouble that happened in the county came out of those gates as well, and the kind of literature we sold in the back attracted all kinds of attention. Once, right after I started there, there had been a break-in. Some fellows from the base had had a lot of drunken fun trashing the place. It was their CO that caught them when they got back and it was he who reported it. But the management up in Waldorf  decided to sweep the whole thing under the rug and not press charges. Can’t lose all those customers, after all\n\nSo, anyway, there I was in the back alley, trying to fire up the first cig of the day, and my old Zippo, the one I got from my dad one time when he came for a visit, finally failed to light. I’d just put lighter fluid in there the other day so I knew it wasn’t that. Had to be the flint. \n\nI knew Juanita wouldn’t be calling again until almost eleven. That’s when she would always make the second phone call of the day, checking on the store. So I decided there was time to go get a new lighter. I just needed a cheap one that they sold at the store down at the corner, good enough to get me through until I could acquire a new flint for my old Zippo. Mornings were usually dead anyway. People typically didn’t make the trip here until their lunch breaks. I put up the 'back in five minutes' sign on the front door, locked it, and turned around. Juanita was standing right there on the pavement in front of me. \n\nI knew it was Juanita because I still recognized her from the one time we met, two years before at the management office in Waldorf. I had just been hired at the time, and was up there to sign paperwork. \n\nI figured Juanita must have been in town that morning all along and had been sent by management to catch me ‘doing something’. I figured she had probably called me that morning from the pay phone in the hotel right across the street.\n\nAll I meant to do was walk down two blocks and across the street to the Peebles, to pick up one of those cheap plastic lighters they sell at the front counter, and then head right back and re-open the store. I started formulating all of this in my head so I could blurt it out to Juanita.\n\nLooking back I keep trying to remember how she was dressed. It was a clear day. There was plenty of light that morning. Maybe we were in the shadow of the building? Thinking about it now, I am going to have to go back there and look. I have been meaning to go back for a while now, even just to drive by the damned place. Just to help piece together what happened that morning. \n\nThe memory is not blurry. It is just that I seem to remember everything that morning suddenly went from being nice and bright to having this veil over it. Everything went into shadow, kind of, with this somber, gray veil. The dress Juanita was wearing was just some house-dress. Dull floral print, maybe? I remember one dull red splat vaguely shaped like a rose was printed on her dress right over one of her boobs. Not flattering. But I remember her face that morning pretty well, too. Her face did not look normal. Juanita was a little overweight from the one time I actually ever laid eyes on her, back when I was first hired, but when I saw her that morning, Juanita’s face was all puffy, almost bloated. One eye and one cheek protruding more prominently than the other. Juanita was not looking directly at me, not glaring with an ‘I got you’ glare. I remember Juanita’s head bobbed and jerked around slightly while she stood there, and I could tell the hair on the back of her head was all pushed up and matted, like oily, unwashed bed-head. But her eyes were halfway open and seemed stuck in position, slightly down and to her left. They did not move at all and did not blink. The lips of her mouth were puffy, too, and parted slightly, and also just kind of frozen in place.\n\nThis situation was awful for me in a couple of different ways. On the one hand, I was alarmed to see anyone from the management office standing there on the curb that morning. As awful as that job was, peddling smut all day, I kind of needed the money. And nobody else in the whole county would hire me for anything at that point in my life. On the other hand, the sight of that person on that sidewalk on that morning was the most unsettling, gut wrenching thing I had ever seen in my life.\n\nI stammered something like ‘just five minutes’ or something like that, and then she started screaming. I mean, it was like someone threw a switch, and a high pitched burglar alarm started going off at the back of Juanita’s throat.\n\nI just kind of stood there, I guess in shock. This went on for a few seconds. Juanita just screamed in this high-pitched, keening wail. Then all at once she stopped, and her face jerked up and her eyes popped open real wide and her mouth started moving. I remember when that happened I kind of jumped back very suddenly and my butt and my elbow connected very hard with the door behind me. \n\nJuanita’s eyes were wide open, with tiny pin-prick pupils. This gurgle started coming out of some place deep in her throat, kind of like a long, growling burp. Then Juanita’s lips started to shift and move around this gurgling sound to form words. \n\n'You shouldn’t have done it' is what Juanita said to me that morning. \n\nThat’s all she said. I remember I was cold and clammy and sweating while all this was occurring. I remember starting to ask her just what the hell was wrong with her. I wasn’t scared of losing the job anymore at that point. I was just very alarmed in general, and I could not figure out why she was acting like this, or what was wrong with her face. I asked her two or three times what the hell was the matter, starting to yell.\n\nJuanita made no reply. Her bulging eyes searched the air past my right shoulder, moving her head from side to side slightly as she did this. Since all this began, her head and neck had become more bloated. The flesh on her face had taken a ghastly pallor. One wisp of black hair floated in front of her face. And I mean it floated, kind of like it was suspended in water rather than blown about by any kind of breeze or gust of air. It was like looking through a sheet of glass at someone suspended inside a big fish tank. Then this terrible, low rasp started coming out of her. I realized Juanita was trying to say something else. It slowly started to sound like Juanita was reciting something in Spanish, but this time not to me. It’s like she was just saying it into the air in front of her. Then Juanita was gone. \n\nI do not mean that Juanita turned and walked off. She did not brush past me and disappear into the store. She did not hop into a nearby car. I did not look away at a distraction and look back and she was gone. I mean, she just vanished into thin air right in front of me in the full light of day. \n\nThere was no way for me to react to this. I was frightened, but nothing seemed to make sense in a way I could react to. I guess I was in shock. Despite my time in the army, despite having survived automobile wrecks, despite being in bar fights, I had no way to react to what had just happened to me. Still don’t. It was like nothing seemed it could be real anymore, like everything was all at once equally ludicrous. The thought of cigarettes and nicotine and a new lighter had completely left my mind, at least for a while. \n\nNext thing I knew I was back in the store, just standing there in the front aisle like customers usually do, with the racks of magazines and the back of the cash register facing me. I don’t completely remember going back in.  I was wondering what to do and simply standing there, dumbfounded. Then I snapped out of my daze a little bit and ran to lock the door. The street was sunny again. There was no sign of Juanita. She was gone.\n\nThen I went back behind the counter, picked up the black plastic phone, and dialed the home office. I dialed Juanita. There was no answer, which was unusual. Someone was always at her desk during office hours. \n\nI went out and paced the aisles for a few moments. There was, of course, the other number I could call, the one that went directly to management. I had never called that one before. That was actually the last number in the world I wanted to call, for a couple of reasons. \n\nI paced some more and then finally, I did call. First I tried Juanita again. No answer. I let it ring until the beeping started. I slammed the receiver down then I picked up the phone again and pressed it to my ear and listened to the dial tone for a few moments. It took some will power but I dialed the other number. I slowly turned the dial for each number, then held my breath while the phone on the other end of the line rang. There was no answer. \n\nI hung up and sat there in the quiet, with just the sound of the overhead lights buzzing away. My hand automatically went up to my shirt pocket where the pack of Tareytons sat. Then I remembered the lighter. Then I called the police. \n\nIt took longer than I expected to get someone on the phone who could handle what I was calling about. Waldorf, where the management office was, is in the next county over. The operator had to keep patching me through to some other place, first the other county, and then the state police barracks nearest to Waldorf. I ended up requesting a welfare check on the home office when I did finally get somebody. They told me a state trooper would drop by the main office and make sure nothing was amiss. Corporal so-and-so would get back to me if I thought it was necessary. I said it wasn’t but if they could just drop by that’d be good enough. \n\nThere was a loud knocking at the front and I jumped, kicking over the stool that had a box of newly shipped VHS tapes balanced on it, the contents of which went scattering. A man was peering through the front door, with his hands cupped over his eyes to see in. Sports jacket, tie, trilby. I realized the 'back in five' sign was still facing the street and the door was still locked. I walked over quickly and opened the door. \n\n'Hey, uh, you carry the, uh, anything on computers?' he was saying. I thumbed vaguely in the direction of the periodicals and said we carry the latest copy of Byte magazine. We did also carry normal periodicals up in the front. Regular books, too. Greeting cards and a spinning-rack of comic books. The dirty stuff was all in the back behind a wall with a door. \n\nAs my customer rummaged around, I kept eyeballing the street out front, completely ignoring the guy while he went about his business. I was looking for Juanita. I could not explain it at the time but I did not want her showing up again.  \n\nMy customer finally got my attention by clearing his throat. I went back and robotically rang him up, wrote the transaction in the blue ledger, then returned to the front door. The guy walked out past me with the morning edition of the Times he had bought tucked under his arm. Something on the front page about a nuclear weapons test France was carrying out that day. I locked the door again behind him and just stood there, keeping an eye on the sidewalk. \n\nLunch time came and went. The black phone never rang. I did not try dialing headquarters again. The P.M. editions of the Times and the Sentinel got dropped off just after when the twelve o’clock bell rang at the naval base. When that thing rang, it could be heard all over town. Going out to fetch the bundles of papers from the curb was the only other time I unlocked the door that day, until the squad car pulled up in the afternoon.\n\nTwo state troopers got out of the squad car, one in uniform and one in plain clothes. Both had little brown mustaches. When I went to unlock the front door I noticed my hands were shaking badly. The two officers noticed as well, and asked if I was alright. I stammered something about not having had a cigarette that day, lighter, flint, something, something. The one in uniform quickly offered me the use of his own lighter. I lit up a cigarette right then and there. I noticed they both had blue eyes and were giving me the exact same expression of deep concern as I tugged on the smoke. Right then and there I knew something absolutely awful had happened. \n\nThe officer in plain clothes asked if there was any place we could sit down and talk, and said that I’d better lock up 'for a few minutes' while we did so. I told the officers that actually other than the stools in the viewing booths in the back of the store, the only option was the stool behind the cash register. As much as they certainly wanted some privacy for what was about to take place, neither wanted to go 'in the back' of a store like mine. So we continued the conversation where we stood. \n\nThe two officers started out asking me what seemed like several dozen questions about the home office in Waldorf. They wanted to know everything I knew about it. They wanted names and roles and rules and titles. They wanted to know when was the last time I had been up there. They wanted to know when was the last time I talked to anyone there. \n\nThen, they asked about my personal history. That got very uncomfortable for me. I don’t see any reason why I have to answer questions like that. What I always do in situations where someone starts asking about my personal history is start out with my years in the army. That’s the first thing I want people to know about me, that I served. It turned out the plain-clothes trooper was ex-army as well, though a little younger than me. After that, I had to explain how I came to work in a place like this. If I am being honest, it was a whole damned string of failures that led up to my then-current state of employment. But that’s nobody’s business, and I conveyed only the bits and pieces the officers needed to know about all that. They both just kind of nodded and jotted stuff down while I did this. The plain-clothes officer was surprised when he heard who my father was. Damn, they managed to extract a lot of information from me. I am pretty sure I am still considered a suspect in all this. \n\nThey asked me about the typical course of business there at my store. I told them about the prompt and daily calls from Juanita. I told them how just this morning, sure as clockwork, Juanita had called me to verify I was in and the lights were on. That is when the nature of the questions changed. The officers seemed like they needed me to say it five times and in five different ways that I had spoken with Juanita that morning, on the phone, and at what time. It was then that they told me Juanita had been murdered that morning, sometime right around nine o’clock.\n\nIt got worse. Much worse. Without going into too much detail, the officers informed me that the head manager and the owner, who had been in that morning for a meeting, were both also murdered around the same time. Of the eight other people who also worked in that building in Waldorf, none of them had yet been accounted for. In the end, it would turn out that there were only six other people in that building, because two had called out. The remaining six are still missing persons cases to this day. I guess I am a suspect in those as well. \n\nThe conversation needed to be continued at the police barracks, I was told. The troopers followed me around the store as I locked things up. They had to follow me into the back so I could lock the rear door. They each made a deliberate effort not to look to either side of them as they walked down the aisles. I understand. That stuff was all pretty awful, really. Made my stomach turn, to be honest.\n\nOn the way over to the barracks, they pulled into a gas station. The plain-clothes trooper  got out for a minute, and came back with a three-pack of cheap plastic lighters for me. \n\nI was taken to the 'new barracks' that apparently has just recently been built and was, or is, 'state of the art.' From the outside, it was a drab but at the same time brutal-looking, one-story building. It had no windows. \n\nInside, the new barracks was mostly one large room full of cubicles. There was a glassed-off conference room right in the middle. I had heard that they were getting computers in this new building. I do not know what I was expecting, but I was shocked to see there was one at almost every desk. They were just like these gray television sets with a bunch of wires coming out of the back. The screens did not look like anything out of Star Trek. They were black with glowing green letters. Each one had a keyboard and some kind of box for electronics beside it. \n\nThere were several regular rooms with doors lining the outer walls of the barracks. I was taken into one of those. At first I got a little scared that they were taking me to a  jail cell. But it was an interrogation room. There was an AC unit, and that thing was cranked up really high. I told the officers that I was cold, and they brought me a cheap, flimsy blanket.\n\nWe all sat at a small table. The two officers wanted to talk more about Juanita. They started with almost the same exact questions they had asked me back at the store. I told them I knew basically nothing about her. I told them that, as far as I knew, Juanita’s sole purpose was to make phone calls to make sure the stores were open on time. The company had the one store I worked at, two others in DC (well, actually right on the border with DC), and one up in Baltimore. Someone else from the home office mailed me my paychecks. Someone else handled delivery of the inventory. I was just there to mind the place, work the cash register, and do bank deposits. \n\nThe officers asked when I had first met Juanita. I told them I had met Juanita about two years ago when I first got hired and was up in Waldorf to sign a bunch of papers. They asked how frequently I spoke to her. I told them 'again, twice a day, on the phone.' They seemed pretty keen about that when I told them. They wanted to know what we talked about. I had to laugh at them at that point. I told them to look back over their notes as I had already told them at least four times about the status calls. But the troopers said they just wanted to hear it from me again, that’s all. \n\nThey asked me why I left the job at the office supply store two years ago. They wanted to know why I was asked to leave the job at the power plant a month before that. They wanted to know why the teaching gig did not work out. I wanted to leave and walk out of the barracks at that point. I would be willing to walk all the way home, or hitch hike. These guys wanted to know about both my failed marriages. They wanted to know about my landlady, for crying out loud. \n\nBut I also knew this was deadly serious business. People had died. I certainly did not want to antagonize the police by standing up and walking out. So I sat through all this and just took it. But I certainly didn’t like answering all of their questions that had nothing to do with my actual job or about the murder case. My personal life was none of their damned business and I don’t like talking about it anyway. It is nobody’s damned business. \n\nAfter another hour of this, I was getting to the point of walking out again. But then their questions circled back to Juanita. Was I ‘involved’ with her? Had I been involved with anybody at the home office? No, I snapped at them, I hadn’t been ‘involved’ with Juanita or any of those people.\n\nThey asked about my car. I told them I did not have a car. Or a truck. Or access to any automobile. I sold my old Sunbeam a while back because it was just too unreliable, and now I had no car.\n\nThey got really interested to hear I had no car. They almost got kind of annoyed. Who doesn’t have a car these days, they asked? How did I get to work? I lived how far from work? And I walked that far every day? Both ways? It was at that point that they both just stood up and left the room. I had to sit there wrapped in my blanket and stew for a couple of hours. \n\nWhen they came back in, finally, they both thanked me very cordially and offered me a lift home. I was still mad at them but accepted the offer. \n\nI left the blanket on the table and walked out of the room with them. I walked down the hall between them. Almost everybody else in the building had clustered in the center conference room. They were all packed around a conference table inside those big glass walls. Hanging in the air about a foot above the tallest person’s head was a thick, blueish haze of cigarette smoke. They had all stopped whatever it was they were doing to look at me as I was being walked out. \n\nThere he goes. There goes the Guy Who Had Something To Do With It. \n\nThey can all drop dead. \n\nI don’t mind walking. I was in army special forces back during Korea. We walked quite a bit back then. When I walked out of the barracks, it was dark, and I knew I was miles from home. But I told the officers to forget the ride, turned away from them, and started walking. \n\nI know they stood there and watched me while I walked off with my hands shoved in my pockets. I never once turned around but I did not hear them go back in. \n\nMost of the county’s roads out there are gravel over top of the sandy loam. This made it easy to hear the car coming up behind me from quite a distance. I could tell it was coming towards me but at a slow, kind of pensive rate. I thought it was another squad car so I just kept going without turning around. \n\nWhen the car pulled up beside me, it wasn’t a squad car. It was a station wagon. \n\n'Hey, uh,' I heard someone say. The voice was a little bit familiar and I realized it was my one single customer from that wretched day. I don’t know if he necessarily recognized me from the store or knew who I was. He made like he was just offering a fellow a ride. By the looks of him, I figure I didn’t have much to worry about, unless he pulled a gun. So I climbed in. \n\n'Where ya headed, fella?' he asked.\n\nI told him what road I was on. The cabin I rented had no actual street address, but if my driver got me to the entrance of the property I’d be alright.\n\n'Waddaya do? Do ya work at the base?' the man asked.\n\nI told him no. Then I just gave him the name of the bookstore. He of course acted like he had never heard of the place. \n\n'Hear about those murders up in Waldorf?' he asked. \n\n'Yeah, I know all about it,' I said without really thinking about the conversation I was having right then and there. \n\nThe car slowed in the middle of the road, practically to a rolling stop. \n\n'Hold on,' my driver said, propping one forearm on the top of the wheel. We were completely stopped, in the dark, in the middle of the road. Fortunately there was no other traffic while this was going on. I turned to look at him. The brim of the trilby cast a shadow and obscured his face.\n\nThe driver leaned over slightly. I could smell his breath.  'You say you know all about the murders that just happened in Waldorf?'\n\n'Do you mean,' he went on, 'like you know about it like you just heard about it on the evening news? Or you ‘know about it’ know about it?'\n\nI exhaled. Working where I work, I hate giving out any personal details. But I had already stepped in it with this guy so I just told him. I told him the office where the murders happened was my company’s main office and I actually knew the people. I told him I had just been talking with the state police all evening.\n\nI ended with, 'I’m helping them with their investigation.'\n\n'Ah,' the man said, 'I see.' \n\nHe straightened back up and took his foot off of the brake.\n\nWe drove on in silence. It finally occurred to me to ask him how the hell he knew about the murders. But a little voice in my head told me that somehow that was a terrible idea and to just get home. \n\n'Here,' I said, once we reached a gas station near my road. 'This is fine. Thanks.'\n\nHe stopped and said something like ‘arright.’ I got out, and immediately walked towards the rear of the car so he’d have no chance to roll down his window and speak to me any further.\n\nI turned as fast as I could onto the dark entrance to my road, and walked it.  The trail that led to the cabin was about a quarter mile down from the main drag. I walked past the dirt driveway that went off to the parked trucks out in front of my neighbors’ cabin. Then I sloshed through the wet carpet of damp fallen leaves that led up to my front door. \n\nOnce inside, I remember lighting the fire because it had started to get a little chilly that evening, and I turned on the radio. I loved listening to that large, crappy radio during nights in that cabin. It got terrible reception out there, but I always left it on a classical music station. You can always make out the piercing beauty of classical music, even through radio static. \n\nSince all that happened, the media circus has come and gone. The case is still open but so far there aren’t going to be any trials. They never charged anyone. The old bookstore is now a boarded-up, rotting tooth in the middle of that strip of store fronts. It has been vandalized multiple times since the landlord had it emptied out. Absolutely nobody will rent that location. \n\nKind of as a result of all the media attention this got, I met a woman who works at the college nearby. We started seeing each other for a while but it didn’t work out. I did, however, do a lot of work on her house while we were dating. After all, I was not working and was idle, and she needed a lot of stuff repaired. When we broke up, she decided it would be more of a clean break if she wrote me a check for all the hours spent on house repairs. That’s why I’ve got my Sunbeam back beneath me again, with a fresh tank of gas in it. My clothes, my books, and the radio are all stashed in the boot. I am leaving town today, leaving the whole DC area this time. I am leaving the murder case, leaving the cabin, leaving my debts, leaving my reputation, escaping my father’s orbit. Heading out west again. Maybe back to Colorado. Maybe I’ll patch things up there. \n\nBut first I am going to drive back into town. I am going to park my car and walk back over to that stretch of sidewalk in front of the old store. I need to go over to that same exact spot, at that same exact hour and minute. I need to check the angle of the light, try to figure out how it all happened. \n\nIt has been two years to the day that the murders happened, and the weather is the same as it was that awful morning. I never told anyone about seeing Juanita that morning. I never shared that part, not with the police, not with anybody. I never told anyone how, right in the instant before she vanished, she raised her jaw just enough that I could see her neck. I never told anyone that the murder weapon was, unmistakably, a length of yellow, army-issue tripwire.“",

        "text": "I didn’t understand teenage girls when I was a teenage boy, and that dynamic persists into fatherhood. My wife was able to act as a bridge between Donna and me, which left me helpless after our divorce. \n\nKids are correct when they accuse parents of not knowing what we’re doing; we’re just trying to fake our way through it while minimizing our mistakes. A lucky few parents are confident enough to believe their own bullshit, but the rest of us are terrified at the knowledge that six thousand years of civilization rest on how badly we fuck up the generation that Fate or nature foolishly left to our care. \n\n“Out,” Donna answered without looking at me. \n\n“With whom?” I responded, folding my arms so that she couldn’t see my hands trembling. \n\nShe looked at the ceiling and played with her fingertips. “Did you have something planned for us tonight?”\n\nI balked at the question to which I didn’t have an answer.\n\nShe pursed her lips and nodded. “Tonight I’ll be okay on my own. I’m just looking to kill time until I go back to Mom’s tomorrow.”\n\nI don’t know if she realized just how much that hurt.\n\nI had no response. \n\nThe awkward silence hung like a cloud. \n\n“A boy from school,” she sighed shoulders slumped. \n\nFrozen nausea tickled my throat as a hundred questions raced through my head. Had Denise talked to her about dating? About sex? Should I have this conversation with her? What would I even say? What would I tell her about safe sex? I don’t think I could bring myself to talk about those details with her if someone gave me a million dollars.\n\n“Dad?” she asked, breaking me from my reverie.\n\n“Um. Can I see a picture of him?”\n\nDonna flashed me an exasperated look.\n\nI went to fold my arms before remembering that they already were folded. Instead, I shifted my weight from one leg to the other. Yes, that would look authoritative. \n\nShe rolled her eyes so far back that I could have sworn I heard them creak.\n\nI didn’t move.\n\nThen Donna reached into her pocket and pulled out her phone, keeping the screen very close as she flashed through her photos. She stopped, raised and lowered her shoulders in a heavy sigh, and held the phone out for me to see, but not touch. I braced myself.\n\nNausea flared through me like a kabob as she revealed a picture of a boy with his arms around her. He stared at the camera with a half-smirk on his sunken, alabaster face. He looked to be about nineteen, but his pinkish eyes could have been thirteen hundred years old.\n\n“His name is Rau.”\n\nI wanted to give an immediate ‘no.’ But the practical end of that action would be driving her further into his arms; nothing is more alluringly carnal than the knowledge that someone is off-limits. \n\nMy deep, steadying breath almost hid how much I was shaking.\n\nI forced a smile that Donna didn’t believe. “Just promise that he’ll drop you off back here on the porch, okay?”\n\n*\n\nSimple fear is an evolutionary holdover that dulls in adulthood: there’s good reason early humans feared insects, the dark, and isolation, but I like to say that I’m mostly over it. We do hold a fear of beings that are almost human but not quite, or should be human yet aren’t. That’s why clowns and werewolves are so terrifying. \n\nBut none of that compares with the evolutionary terror that awakens *later* in life: the fear that we will fail to protect our children has kept us alive despite our best efforts to kill ourselves. That terror is far deeper than any clown with a spider leg for a tongue tickling us in the dark.\n\nWhich is why I was waiting just inside the front door with the porch light on and living room lights off for three hours. I wish I could have been bored, but an unquiet mind doesn’t have time for such indulgences. \n\nEvery car that flew by sent my heart rate past 140. \n\nSo I was almost ready to pass out when I heard a car door slam and two sets of footsteps walking toward my apartment. I peeked through the small window to see that Rau had his arm wrapped around my daughter’s waist in the same way that I’d always held Denise in that first year of dating as we embraced after putting our clothes back on. \n\nI felt my knuckles turning white as I squeezed the stick.\n\nThey got to the front door. Donna glanced at the window, but I’m 90% sure she couldn’t see me looking back. \n\nThen she turned back to Rau and smiled. He kissed her hungrily. \n\nI looked away. \n\nI took a deep breath.\n\nThen I opened the door.\n\nRau looked at me as he gently pushed Donna behind him. He didn’t smile.\n\n“Did you come to see her, or did you come to see me?” I asked in a heavy voice. \n\n“Dad!” she squeaked.\n\nRau ran his pale fingers through her hair. “Can’t blame a guy for being hungry,” he answered hoarsely.\n\n“Oh my God, *Dad*, why are you doing this? Please just let me go back to Mom’s a night early and leave me alone.”\n\nThe last three words hit me like a stake in the heart. Children don’t know how profoundly they can hurt their parents.\n\nRau flashed a thin smile from ten feet away. “How about it?” he asked, his voice silky. “Will you back off?”\n\nI squeezed tighter. “I can’t do that.”\n\n“Dad,” she whimpered.\n\nRau nodded. “So be it.” He pulled Donna closer and lowered his jaw farther than any natural mouth could open as long, thin teeth dripped like needles from his gums.\n\nWe both knew I was too far away to intervene fast enough.\n\nWhat Rau *didn’t* realize was that I was holding a long, thin piece of wood behind my back. I was tossing it to Donna as he prepared to bite. \n\nHer hand caught the stake in the same smooth motion that brought its tip into his cheekbone. A pale skin flap tore from Rau’s face as Donna’s strike deflected his bite, sending him staggering from the unexpected attack. As he released Donna, she stepped back and swung her newfound momentum into a half-circle, whipping the stake back around and directly into his chest, the tip erupting from his back. \n\nShe released the weapon and covered her mouth in shock as he stumbled down the stairs and collapsed.\n\nI ran toward them – but for the first time I can remember, I stopped short of confronting an attacker. \n\nI was certain that she’d ended the threat.\n\nI held my daughter close and hugged her. She trembled. I kissed the top of her head. \n\n“Dad?” she whispered, staring down at Rau’s unmoving body. “Dad? *Dad?*” Each word got an octave higher.\n\nWhen she was ready, Donna turned to face me. Her eyes conveyed a storm of thoughts – confusion, dread, and very, very deep below the surface, a glimmer of understanding.\n\n“What the fuck just happened?” she whispered.\n\nI squeezed her shoulders. “We’re hunters, Donna. My side of the family always has been.”\n\nHer jaw fell as she continued to talk in a pitch that was just below the ‘only-dogs-can-hear-this’ threshold. “Hunters of what?”\n\n“Vampires.”\n\n“Oh.” She looked ready to pass out. “And – um – how did I do that thing with the wooden stick? I didn’t think before acting, my body just – did it.”\n\nI looked down at her and smiled sadly. “I didn’t teach you how to walk, Donna, and you didn’t make a conscious decision to learn. I just watched as you figured out what you were always meant to do.” I sighed. “But that didn’t make me any less proud.”\n\nShe nodded absently. “So fighting and killing that-”\n\n“Vampire.”\n\n“Right, Rau was a vampire,” she answered in a distant voice. “So fighting and killing him is something I’m – sort of – programmed to do?”\n\n“That’s a way of putting it.”\n\n“And you knew that he was a vampire before I went out with him, before he and I-” she stopped herself and swallowed as she looked up at me with eyes that shined in the porch light. “How did you know I would be able to fight him off?”\n\nI squeezed her shoulders once more, softer this time. “Parenthood is a process of letting go,” I answered. “Tonight, I knew that you would be [okay on your own](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”\n\n[BD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/)\n\n\n\n\n[W](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcn_pa1QfNMRzbTuJqXSoRQ)\n\n[E](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/)",

        "text": "The others attempted to rush him but I had sprinted toward him quicker than they could and tackled him through the doorway into the bunker. [\"Get the door!\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11nc12i/site_46_is_offline_part_one/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) I shouted just after landing. Sure enough, too, they managed to get the door shut and locked just before one of them could barge in. Daniel and I were on the ground for a solid two minutes, rigid, stiff, unable to move, before finally realizing it was safe to relax. \"What.. the fuck... was that?\" Daniel asked, panting.\n\n\"I... I don't know... I think that was one of the Hazmat crew.\"\n\n\"The Hazmat crew?\" one of the others asked. I shook my head, looking at Daniel.\n\n\"You saw it, too, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah...\" he replied, shuddering. \"Yeah, I saw that.\"\n\n\"But what happened to him, and who are those others?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Craig and I found him stumbling into the hallway before he turned into...\" I pointed to the door, \"*that*.\"\n\n\"Where're the others?\" Daniel asked.\n\n\"That was them, man. The thing got to 'em, did something to them, and now they're just like him.\" His and everyone else's eyes doubled in size when I said this.\n\n\"What is it?\" someone asked.\n\n\"I just told you I don't know!\" I shouted back.\n\n\"You said it was one of the Hazmat crew?\" Daniel asked again. I shook my head. The two of us picked ourselves off the ground and dusted ourselves off, caught our breaths, and Daniel asked me to start from the beginning. I told him, as best I could -- most of it at the time was kind of a blur to me so it took me a second -- everything that happened.\n\n\"I don't know what the hell any of that was, other than something obviously's gone wrong topside and now...\" I finished by gesturing to the door again.\n\n\"Well now what do we do?\" someone cried from my right.\n\nSomeone else cried, \"We're screwed now. There's no one to come for us!\"\n\n\"Alright, alright, calm down, people.\" Daniel said. They all looked at him. \"Look, panicking ain't gonna do us no--\"\n\n\"Oh, can it.\" someone from the crowd shouted.\n\nAnother person shouted, \"Yeah, look what's happening now, man. How the hell are we *not* supposed to panic?\" The room was in utter pandemonium again. Everyone, everywhere, at the same time was shouting all different variants of either \"We're fucked\" or \"We're all gonna die\" and shit like that. I watched Daniel try pitifully to calm the room down. His usually dominant voice, one that would've made a drill Seargent jealous, was now little more than a pathetic coo of a child in the midst of a sea of cacophony.\n\nJust like earlier, I can't say I actually blamed them for wanting to panic. That being said, it wasn't calming my own nerves either, so I took matters into my own hands to get everyone's attention by grabbing the nearest jar that contained the medical supplies and smashed it on the ground. Almost immediately, the room went dead silent.\n\n\"Alright, listen, I can't take any more craziness right now, okay?\"\n\nSome smartass from the back piped up saying, \"This coming from the dumbass that started this shit in the first place.\" I looked in the direction the voice came from. I couldn't see him but it didn't matter, I could see they were all in agreement from the look they were all collectively giving me.\n\n\"You know what, you're right. It was my fault. It was my fault this thing, whatever the unholy hell it is, is spreading and it's my fault the others are fucked now. There, that what you wanted to hear? Yes, it. Was. My. Fault. But damn it, sitting here, panicking, isn't gonna do us a damn bit of good, now will it?\"\n\nThey all continued looking at me while my attention turned to Daniel. \"Now, what do you think we should do?\" He chuckled, sort of condescendingly, but in his case, it was warranted this time around.\n\n\"Well, I'd say the best bet would be to try and reach someone off the site.\"\n\n\"How?\" I asked. He pulled out his phone and began dialing.\n\n\"That won't work, will it?\" someone from the back of the crowd asked. \"The signal's restricted, ain't it?\"\n\n\"It is,\" I said, \"but there's a system for emergency calls, ain't there? Sort of like a failsafe line; the \"Lockdown line\", right, that brings the emergency teams?\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\" he said, putting the phone to his ear. \"And if you paid attention to at least *one* of the million training videos they forced us to watch, you'd remember the safeword to initiate said line, like I--\" He stopped dead, his eyes going wide.\n\n\"What?\" I asked. My heart was instantly thrown into high gear again. \"Spit it out, what is it?\" He turned around and looked at me, face white as a damn piece of paper and said the words that've haunted every second of my sleep ever since then for a year; \"Site 46 is offline...\"\n\n\"Wait what?\" someone asked. \"What does that mean?\"\n\nNot taking my eyes away from Daniel, I said in a shuddering breath, \"It means we're cut off completely.\"\n\n\"So wait, that means we can't call for help? At all?\" they cried.\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"So what the fuck are we gonna do?\" I didn't reply -- I really couldn't. I was out of ideas, having already realized my ideas were bad anyway, and Daniel was in perpetual shock, not even having brought the phone down from his ear.\n\n\"Won't someone from the head levels notice something's up when they see the power's out and the signal's gone?\" I heard another ask.\n\n\"They might, but even if they have already noticed, which honestly isn't likely, It'd still be a good few days, maybe weeks, before they could get an emergency team out here that way. The Lockdown crew was meant for immediate emergencies like this, but without the signal--\"\n\n\"Well is there a way to get the signal back online?\" they interjected.\n\n\"The only way's through the main office.\" said Daniel, finally returning his phone to his pocket.\n\n\"You mean we'd have to go out *there?!*\" someone else cried.\n\n\"We'll all die!\" exclaimed another. \"Those things'll get us and--\"\n\n\"Settle down, damn it!\" I shouted. \"Just told you I can't take any more anxiety right now.\" I looked again at Daniel. \"What's the quickest way to get there, do you know?\" He looked down and shook his head.\n\n\"Only route I know of through the main corridors.\"\n\n\"Okay, well, obviously that's out. I mean, my little crew from earlier didn't even make it out of this hallway before getting fucked up.\"\n\n\"Well then we're stuck because there isn't any other way to the--\"\n\n\"Not true, I think I may know of a way.\" piped someone from the very back. Daniel and I looked over to him. He was a round man with overalls and a hardhat with a toolbelt around his waist. Maintenance and engineering crew. Makes sense *he'd* be the one to say this. Daniel waved him to come forward and he did.\n\n\"You said you have another route to the main office?\" Daniel asked.\n\n\"I think so, I mean, it's a bold maneuver; something I myself haven't used in ages now, and I don't know nothin' about where these things y'all are talkin' about are now, but--\"\n\n\"Out with it.\" I said impatiently.\n\nHe cleared his throat and said, \"Well, if I remember correctly, there should be a tunnel network us maintenance crew use to get around, you know?\" Daniel and I both silently nodded. \"It's supposed to have access to every part of the site and get you to any place here you wanted to go.\"\n\n\"And you could access this place from in here?\" asked Daniel.\n\n\"Uh huh, in fact, it's right over there.\" He pointed to a spot in the far left corner. He walked over and and lifted up four of the tiles to reveal a drop into a small tunnel.\n\n\"That's been there the entire time?\" someone asked.\n\n\"Yeah,\" the maintenance guy responded, \"every room in every wing of Site 46 has one of these.\"\n\n\"How come you didn't say something about this before?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, like I said, I ain't used 'em in a while. Nobody I know has. Honestly, I'm a bit surprised it's still here.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well see, like I told you, they were reserved for the maintenance workers to get around. Thing is, though, those tunnels ain't exactly roomy, if you take my meaning. They ain't that well lit, either, and unfortunately, the physicals and screenings they subjected us to for this job weren't thorough enough to catch the unfortunate bastards that had severe claustrophobia, so while we would be trying to get from point A to point B, you'd have Ol' Harry behind ya, wigging out, so they finally told us that we'd just remain topside and move around with the rest of youse.\"\n\nDaniel and I looked down at the tunnel. The guy wasn't kidding about the tunnel looking cramped. It looked like it would just barely fit an average sized person, giving him *just enough* room to walk in one direction with none left to spare for him to turn his head. The two of us looked up at each other.\n\n\"So this's our play?\" I asked.\n\n\"Unless you have a better suggestion.\" he replied, gesturing his eyes to the door, silently teasing me. I sighed and looked back down into the tunnel. *Great, instead of a dark ass hallway, it's a dark ass tunnel.*\n\n\"So exactly how're we gonna do this? You know we can't all fit in there at the same time.\" He sighed, looking back down himself.\n\n\"Yeah, that is the rub, ain't it?\" He thought for a moment before asking me, \"Say, \"Iron Rod\", you wanna try taking point again?\" I looked up at him. He had his eyebrow raised in an eager manner, one that suggested he was planning something bold.\n\n\"Uh... Sure, I guess...\"\n\n\"Well I was thinking, since you were the only one dumb enough to wanna go out there the first time, and the one that decided to drag the rest of us down with ya, why don't you *actually* be the hero this time around?\" I frowned at him.\n\n\"What do you me--\" Then it hit me like a moving train. \"Oh, you motherfucker!\" His snide little grin grew and he winked, pointing downward. I glanced back and forth between him and the tunnel. \"What the hell, man? I can't go it alone, not down there.\"\n\n\"What, you afraid of tight spaces all of a sudden?\"\n\n\"No, but... What if those things are in there?\"\n\n\"Well, you managed to slip your little ass out of trouble before, you'll do it again.\"\n\n\"But I don't know how to even get to the main office from here, not through there.\" This legitimately seemed to stump him. He started looking around at the crowd then.\n\n\"Does anybody still have their walkies?\" he asked. One guy stepped forward with his, which was then rudely thrust into my chest by Daniel before he then took out his own and started tuning it. \"Okay, now I'm gonna walk you through how to get there.\" He looked over to the maintenance guy and asked, \"Hey, you got any kind of map of these tunnels?\"\n\nHe dug around in his pocket and replied, \"As a matter of fact, I do.\" He pulled out a small folded up map and handed it to Daniel. Daniel then told him to give me his headlamp before telling me, making sure to add his signature shit-eating smirk -- complete with his TV spokesperson's wink and thumbs up -- to hurry and get my ass down the hatch into the tunnels.\n\n\"Good luck, *buddy!\"* was the last thing he said to me before I reluctantly dropped into the tunnels. *\"Buddy\"... Yeah up yours, too...*\n\nAs soon as I dropped down, I struggled taking a step forward because of the way the walls were so tightly packed together. It felt like what you'd expect a piece of bread to feel while popped into a toaster; compacted on both sides of you with no way to turn or go to get out. It made sense, too, that I  was the one he sent down there, too. Next to, as he put it, \"Being the only one bold enough to try something stupid like this the last time\", I was also likely the only one that even had a chance of fitting down here and being able to maneuver as easily as I was. Everyone else, those that could've even fit that is, would've still had a far harder time than me trying to move.\n\nAs soon as I was out of sight range from the hatch, I heard the walkie going off. *\"Breaker, breaker, this is Smoky here, I repeat, Smokey here, how ya doin' down there, Bandit? Over.\"* I couldn't help but scoff at this. He was *really* making jokes about this right now. *Yeah, laugh it up, asswipe.*\n\nI clicked the button and replied, \"It's about as cramped in here as your sister was last night, but overall, no trouble yet, I guess.\" I could imagine the entire room just busting their guts laughing at this. Yep, that was Steel Jockey humor for you; even when in the worst of situations, we downplay it like it's just another day on the site. Be it our first, or tragically the last, we're gonna make jokes about it. *\"Alright, now you're gonna keep going straight till you find a two way crossroad. There, you're gonna want to take a right. Copy that, Bandit? Over.\"*\n\n\"I copy, Jackass. Over.\"\n\n*\"Uh, Uh, \"Smokey's\" the name, Bandit. Over.\"*\n\nPutting on my best hillbilly accent, I clicked the button and replied, \"Well now I hear ya, loud n' clear, Smokey ol' pal. I'll just mosey on down yonder to those there crossways you was yappin' about n' go my happy ass on down to the main office. On the way, might just bag me a coupla them ornery little critters that've been runnin' BUCK wild down here. Yee haw!\"\n\n*\"Alright, alright, seriously though, where are ya now? Over.\"*\n\n\"I'm at the crossing now, actually. You said to take a right now, didn't you? Over.\"\n\n*\"That's right, Bandit, just take yourself a right, then you'll go till you hit another junction, then you'll take another right. Copy? Over.\"*\n\n\"Copy that, Smokey, Ol' buddy. Over.\" I rolled my eyes and took the right. Fortunately, the halls were actually a bit more spread apart from each other, allowing me at least enough room to actually turn and look over my shoulder. The only complaint I would have about this hall though was just how damn hot it was. I mean, I took five, maybe seven steps, and I was already out of breath and sweating. I couldn't keep it up much longer if this was going to be the conditions of the place. Fortunately, it wasn't long until I actually hit the next junction.\n\nI took the right, where I was met with the surprise of the room now being ice cold. I clicked on the radio. \"Alright, Smokey, I'm freezing my ass off in the next tunnel, where do I go from here? Over.\"\n\n*\"Alright, from that tunnel, you'll go till you're about three fourths of the way there, then you're gonna find a hatch that's gonna take you to another tunnel junction. Go through there and take the left, copy? Over.\"*\n\n\"Copy that, Over.\" *Okay, so just go THREE FOURTHS of the way there... No problem... Right?*\n\nWell there was a problem. Now, I didn't have the map or blueprints in front of me like Daniel did, nor did I know the ins and outs of this area like the maintenance guy did, but if I was a betting man, I'd have gambled everything I had that the past two tunnels I'd gone through were somehow connected to the central A.C. units, which would explain why one was scorching hot while the next almost gives you frostbite the second your dumb ass walks in. Unlike the last tunnel, this one wasn't a short trek, either. (*Yeah, thank GOD it's only 3/4 of the way this time...)*\n\nI pushed on as hard as I could, my hands and feet going completely numb after reaching what I figured was the quarter of the way into the tunnel. My breath was forming clouds in front of my face. *Jesus, yeah, I can imagine people losing their minds having to work in areas like this.* Part of me also wondered if maybe Daniel knew somehow that this little crusade would take me through a place like this and purposely sent me in without a jacket of something; you know, for laughs. *\"Steel Jockey humor\" for you...*\n\nI got to the midway point before I stopped, hearing a clanking noise coming from all around me. It rang from all sides, above me as well as to my left and right. I looked, but couldn't see anything moving or any sort of indentations of the metal being pressed upon. I figured then that it was just the units trying to kick back in, sort of trying to fight to get recirculating through the building again, so I shook my head and continued shambling forward.\n\nIn two seconds, my guess was proven to be horrifically wrong when I watched the hatch in front of me get thrown open where a man fell out onto the frigid metal floor. I heard him groaning and I froze. I wasn't about to get any closer to him. I'd learned at least *that much* from last time.\n\nThe man struggled to pick himself up and he looked at me. He wore the uniform of one of the lab workers. It was a lab monkey, and he looked like he'd already got the worst of whatever he and his little band of geeks in the Chem labs conjured up. Ironic, ain't it?\n\nHis skin was albino, standing out from the darkness of the tunnel, and his eyes were sunken into their sockets and his jaw hung like it was barely being held to his head by a piece of string. He reached out to me and I took a step back with every step he took forward. He groaned again and this time, I faintly made out what I think were the words \"Help me, please.\"\n\nWhatever he said, it was immediately forgotten when he fell flat on his face and that all too hauntingly familiar *POP* echoed through the tunnel, which was my cue to gun it the hell out of there. I didn't wait around for the creature to get itself up and moving. No, I was gone; back out of the freezing tunnel, through the scorching one, and from there, I just went in whatever direction I could. I didn't look over my shoulder, either, because I could hear it's tentacles crashing against the floor behind me. Even worse this time around was how the thing's gurgling noises actually echoed, which made me imagine it being much closer, right on top of me the entire time.\n\nIn the frenzy, I somehow managed to wrestle the walkie from my pocket without hurling it half across the room and mashed the button again. \"Daniel! Daniel, we got trouble.\" I waited, still bolting into God only knew where. \"Daniel!\" Nothing.\n\nI was right in the middle of trying to cry out again when I stopped suddenly, hearing the croaking noise coming around the corner just a few feet away from where I was. *Shit!* I waited for a moment, not knowing whether to run or stay put. I swung my head backwards to find a dead end with a two way crossway. The gurgling came closer round the bend. I stepped back, ready at any moment to start booking. Just when it seemed like the thing was about to jump out from around the corner, it stopped and so did I. My breath caught in my throat.\n\n*God, just go away...* I pled silently. *Please, God, make it go away...*\n\nGod appeared to have my back, too, because sure enough, the gurgling noise trailed further and further away. Even still, it was at least a good five to ten minutes before I felt safe enough to move again. The first thing I did was to arch my neck as much as possible without moving to peek around the corner. The coast was clear for the moment, so I took the chance to *slowly*, tiptoeing like I was a kid trying to sneak in the house past curfew, walk back through the tunnel the way I thought I came from.\n\nLike I said, the coast was clear, but there was a new problem. I didn't know at all where the hell I was. I lost the creature, but now I don't know where to go next or at least how to get back to the quarantine room. I fumbled with the walkie again.\n\n\"Daniel! Daniel, Goddamn it, pick up!\" Nothing. I kept clicking the call button, but I could hear only interference. *Just fuckin' wonderful, don't that just beat all? I have no idea where I am, where I am, and no fuckin' signal.* After taking a deep breath, hitting the wall next to me, I opened my eyes and started walking forward. I stayed going down the tunnel I was in for another meter or two before taking a right into a tunnel that was probably the only one down here that was actually \"roomy\" as the maintenance guy put it.\n\nIt was also the only one that was semi well lit, using overly bright fluorescent lighting that lined the length of the ceiling. At either side of me along the walls were large panes of glass that appeared to peer into what looked like either an aquarium or *some* sort of water tank. It was bright green with small bubbles rising from the bottoms and in the middle, were these weird little... *things* \\-- I can't really describe them as anything other than \"things\" -- that were suspended from long black cables that dangled from the tops of the tanks.\n\nThey just dangled there, like fishing worms, until my dumb ass put my face up to the glass for a closer look, where the damn thing started squirming frantically, startling me half to death. *The fuck is that thing?!* It looked like it was just a tiny ball of shiny, inky black tentacles, furiously writhing around like an electric current had just been shot through it. It didn't have any real features, either, just about ten or twelve tiny wiggling appendages coming out of everywhere on it's body. In a weird way, it kind of reminded me of those koosh balls I used to play with when I was a kid, only those didn't make me sick to my stomach when the little silicone bristles moved like this thing did with its tentacles.\n\nWorse yet was when I looked over at the other tanks to see that the others were now writhing as well. It was like I'd disturbed the one, which then made the others lose their shit as well, like how when there's two babies in a room and one starts wailing, prompting the other to do the same. Basically, I'm saying that these things apparently had some kind of psychic connection and could tell when something was wrong. I guess I was either too curious or too grossed the fuck out though for htis to fully kick in. That is, until I heard the pitter-patter of tendrils stabbing the floor in a beeline for the tunnel I was in.\n\nThat was my one and only warning to get going, so I immediately started hauling ass once again for the other end of the corridor. One problem though -- there wasn't any exit. I made it all the way to the other end of the hallway, only to find a small maintenance locker. I threw my head back, wondering if I could chance trying to run back out the way I came, but it was no good. Two seconds after I turned my head, I watched one of the tentacles slither into the entry of the tunnel. *Shit!*\n\nI froze for a single second longer, long enough for two more of the tendrils to come shooting out of the hall leading in, before instinct kicked back in and I climbed into the, thankfully empty and big enough (though obviously still uncomfortably cramped as hell), locker. Through the slits, I watched the creatures -- there were TWO this time -- lumber into the room. One of them had at least three of the primary tentacles coming out of the poor bastard's *mouth*, with his body just dangling down from it like a stuck pig in a meat locker. It was absolutely disgusting and I would've puked right then and there if I wasn't worried about making sure they didn't see me.\n\nThey slithered close to the tanks and made their gross little gurgling noises to both themselves and to the glass. *Must be talking to each other,* I figured. A mating call maybe? Though, looking back, if I could take a guess, I'd say it was more of a *feeding* call than anything else. An alert that yet another human being was in their ranks and NOT one of them. This idea would make sense because in another moment, the really disgusting one started looking around the room, using the tentacles to start tossing the area like it was the FBI on a drug bust. They seemed eager, too, judging from the way its gurgling noises sounded now more like howls of frustration. They knew I was there, and I had a bad feeling it wouldn't be long before one of them decides to think checking the locker. What was I gonna do then? Not a damn thing, that's what.\n\nI couldn't fight them, there was no way to get past them both to outrun them, and to top it *all* off -- I STILL DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IN FUCKING HELL I WAS! The one got right up against the locker, gazing around, examining the vents. Think of any scene from any movie where the hero is trying to hide from the monster and the monster gets right up to where they're hiding, trying to make 'em crack and come out by sniffing around for them. It was *just* like that. God had my back again, though, because the fucker didn't seem to want to linger around long before joining his partner.\n\nThe two of them started gurgling back and forth to one another, \"talking to each other\" I guess you could say, before one of them shot one of their tendrils through the glass, shattering it. The other immediately followed suit, shattering the other one. In seconds, water filled the tunnel almost halfway already. Before I could even realize anything that was happening, I could feel the water seeping through the cracks of the locker.\n\nIn only a few MORE seconds, the water inside the locker was up to my thighs. *Oh great, so if I'm not taken out by them, I'll get DROWNED out!* Through the slits again, I saw the creatures, both the one's WITH bodies as well as the small ones inside the water tanks, slither away into the hallway, treading the water as they went along. By that point, the water -- which I might add was almost numbingly cold, to a point where I had actually lost feeling in both my lower legs -- had reached above my kneecaps, yet still, I waited at least another half a minute after the creatures were gone before finally clamoring out of the locker.\n\nWading through the flooded tunnel, I looked to see the empty tanks. Water was still steadily pouring in from them, running all throughout and out of the tunnel. I made my way to the hallway and peered around the corner. Seeing that the coast, for the time being anyway, that *I* could see, was clear, I scrambled for the walkie again and decided to try my luck with it again. \"Daniel! Come on, you son of a bitch, PICK UP!\"\n\nStatic.\n\nBy that point, I was ready to hurl the damn thing, but instead I clipped it back to my pocket, took a deep breath, and started forward again, staying cautious to make as little noise as possible. At first, my plan was to try following the flow of the water that was quickly flooding the rest of the tunnels, only to realize about twenty minutes in that this was a fruitless endeavor thanks to just how many diverting tunnels there were. None of the pathways seemed recognizable to me either. Then, before losing myself any deeper, I decided to turn around and turn back toward the tunnel I came from.\n\nI figured, being that that was where whatever those things are were being born, grown, germinated, whatever, that that must also be close to the Chem labs. If so, then that meant I should be able to find a way out through there and use the Chem Labs to make it through to the main office. The walk back took longer than it did going forward, mostly thanks to the fact that my body was now shivering with every step, plus the anxiety not allowing me to try walking any faster than 2 miles per hour. Eventually though, I made it back to the tunnel, where I started searching for any sort of entry out of there and to the surface.\n\nThe maintenance guy HAD said that there were hatches to each area of Site 46, so I knew it'd have to be *somewhere* in that tunnel. After all, how the hell else did they manage to access it to hold, examine, test, and/or whatever the hell else those motherfuckers were doing with them? Of course, this inevitably led to my mind questioning once again just *what* the fuck were these things and what were they doing with them? Up to that point, you know, I'd all but shoved the question to the back of my mind, but after seeing what I had earlier in that tunnel, I couldn't help but really start wondering.\n\nHow long had these things even *been* here, or were they just some new development? What about all the times other crew members from various wings of the facility had been called to the Chem Labs for test work? Had *they* been subjected to these things? I mean, it doesn't seem likely, given that this was, as far as I knew at least, the first time anything like this had ever happened, but then...\n\n*Could they have been subjected to these things, too?*\n\nI'll tell you, it was everything I could do and beyond to keep shoving down my questioning and just focus on finding my way out of the damn tunnels. I looked all around the corridor but found nothing except the storage locker. Then I looked inside the empty tanks that held the creatures and decided to try my luck looking there. I have to say, I was both shocked and a bit alarmed when I actually ended up finding what I was looking for here. Located at the top of the tank, right above where the thing was being held by the cables earlier, was a large hatch door.\n\nNow, I say alarmed because automatically, I realized there was only one reason for this. Think about it, of all locations in the tunnel, why right inside of the tank above the thing? Okay, so playing \"benefit of the doubt\", you could say that it was for feeding or something, right? Except then, why was it large enough to admit a grown man? That left me with only one conclusion, as well as an answer to my earlier question. They *HAD* been exposing others to this thing before, which meant that either they'd encountered this situation before and had implemented some sort of way of terminating them before they'd get out of control like they were now, or the people they'd tested were somehow immune to these things and their effects, OR...\n\n*Or these things knew how to be patient inside of people.*\n\nThis made the entire inside of my body drop below zero. If these things could linger inside of people, then how did I know who was infected and who wasn't? How did I know that *I* wasn't infected? Granted, I hadn't exactly been stabbed or anything, but even still, how did I know if that was their *only* way of infesting their victims?\n\nI came out of the tanks and entered into the main testing room of the Chem Labs. The room was mostly dark, which made trying to see a damn thing almost impossible. The only light in the room came from the teeny tiny little red lights peppered across the ceiling in the four corners of the room that just barely even lit the small radii around them. That said, there was still a good bit that I *could* see; namely the many papers lining the wall. From what I could really make out, most of them were weird sort of diagrams, either of people, animals, or of other things that looked both recognizable and unrecognizable at the same time.\n\nI focused hard, though, on the ones I saw that depicted, or at least seemed to depict, the creatures. In the diagrams, I saw people appearing to be exposed to them via pricking. A lot of the handwriting was both sloppy and illegible, but some of it, I saw, read:\n\n**\"Specimen X-12: chemical engineered symbiote.\"**\n\nI grabbed a few of these documents off of the wall and began looking over them in the light as best I could. Here's one of the files I managed to read in entirety.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n# \"Monolith file 336-556-9: 'Project Anti-venom'\"\n\n**\"Specimen X-12 is a chemically engineered symbiote. Purpose: provision of enhanced antibodies into human body; effectively eliminating all diseases or ailments in the body, as well as enhancement of physical activity overall.\"**\n\n**\"Hypothesis: After exposure to Specimen X-12, a human host -- of any age, race, ethnicity, sex, or health condition -- will be not only cured of any and/or all ailments, thus prolonging life almost indefinitely, but will also receive major enhancements in endurance, durability, and reflexes.\"**\n\n**\"Method: By obtaining volunteers from various members of Monolith staff; each of varying backgrounds and/or conditions and circumstances, we will begin testing the effects of exposure to human subjects. First wave of trials shall occur the first week of every month for the next twelve to fifteen months, after which time, total results will be collected and reviewed by higher Monolith administration.\"**\n\n**\"During the trials, seven volunteers will be selected to undergo testing, according to the choosing of H.O.E. (Head of Experiment), individually undergoing testing once per corresponding day.\"**\n\n**\"Note: Human trials are to go on record as having occurred AFTER extensive animal testing (see prior documentation, dated from 2019). Trials showed extreme promise, especially in primates and other mammalian subjects. We act in good faith that such fruit will be borne with human trials.\"**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI remember almost wanting to vomit when I read that last line. \"In good faith\". Yeah, because horrendous things NEVER happen when it's purely done \"in good faith\", right? These eggheaded fuckin' wingnuts experimented on PEOPLE! And don't even TRY telling me they actually told them what the fuck they were actually taking part in, not with how secretive those fuckheads were. No, I'll bet they told them they were getting a flu shot or a physical or some shit; something that staff was required to undergo periodically, only to find that what was *really* happening was that they were unintentional, nonconsensual lab rats.\n\nI tried looking through the documents, but any sort of reports on the project, any other notes or \"calculations\" regarding the trials, must have been trashed long ago or taken when the place was hurriedly evacuated, which would explain also the way the room was trashed. I guess they left these few documents; the diagrams and the introduction, as a sort of \"fail safe\", in case they managed to diffuse the situation and return to the laboratory and salvage some record of the project.\n\nWell, in an ironic way then, I guess they can thank me for that because I then pocketed the documents before making my way to the door at the far end of the room. Turning the knob, I felt every joint in my body seize up at once when I heard the now all too familiar croaking sound coming from right outside the door. *SHIT! I can't get to the main office with that thing right on top of me**!*",

        "text": "I moved in with my grandma about a year ago. Some people think it’s dorky for a 21-year-old to live with her grandma, but I love it. She’s the best roommate—never complains, even when I have people over or stink up the kitchen with a cooking experiment. The rent’s cheap, and in return I cook for her, drive her around, etc. We’re really close too—she’s kind, has a sharp sense of humor, and can entertain me for hours with tales from her childhood in Italy.\n\nBut then things started to change.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, I needed some scissors. They weren't in the usual place, so I went upstairs to Grandma's room, where she sews sometimes.\n\nBut just as my hand touched the doorknob, she came flying up the stairs.\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"Are the scissors in your room?\"\n\n*\"Don't go in my room!\"*\n\nShe glared at me as I made my way back downstairs. *That was... weird. She'd never told me to stay out of her room before.*\n\nAnd the trend only continued. She started to become more reclusive, more private. Closing herself off to me. When she didn't eat dinner with me two days in a row, I made her favorite—chicken and wild rice. But all she said was \"Sorry, dear, I'm full,\" before disappearing up the stairs.\n\n\"How could she be full?\" I grumbled to myself, as I spooned the leftovers into a Tupperware. \"I haven't seen her eat anything tonight.\"\n\nI told my mom I was starting to worry. But she didn’t seem concerned. “Older people sometimes change. Grandma’s almost 90, and well… she knows it’s going to be her time soon. Sometimes people get depressed, or bitter, or just *different.* Your grandpa definitely did.”\n\nBut I couldn’t stop the horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach, that there was just something… *wrong.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAs the days went on, the feeling continued to grow.\n\nOn Saturday morning, our neighbor stopped by to ask if we could get his mail while he was away. As he stood there on the porch with his big German Shepherd, my Grandma started down the stairs.\n\nThe dog began to growl.\n\nNot just a little growl. Hackles up, teeth bared, the whole nine yards. “Woah, easy, Teton,” our neighbor said, backing away.\n\n*Rrrrrooof!*\n\n“I’d better go,” he said sheepishly. But as he ran down the driveway, the dog kept glancing back at us, barking.\n\n“What did he want?” Grandma asked behind me.\n\nI jumped. She was *right* behind me—and somehow I hadn’t heard her creep up. “Uh, we have to get his mail for a few days,” I replied, closing the door. “That’s okay. Right?”\n\nShe just shrugged and walked away.\n\nThings continued to get worse. I’d wake up in the middle of the night and hear her footsteps out in the hallway. Back and forth, back and forth. I had half a mind to think the place was haunted—until I opened my door a crack and saw her figure, clothed in her floral nightgown, walking back and forth.\n\nOnce, when class was canceled and she didn’t know I was home, I heard her crying upstairs. I peeked around the corner to see her standing in front of my bedroom door, her face hiding in her hands. “Grandma?” I called. But she simply shook her head and ran into her bedroom.\n\nAnd then there was the smell.\n\nNow when I went upstairs, this horrible stench hit me. A rotting, decaying smell. Like someone had left a plate of raw meat out for days.\n\nAnd as I sniffed around, I realized it was coming from Grandma's room. But when I turned the knob—the door was locked.\n\n\"Grandma... have you noticed it, uh, kinda smells up there? Did you leave some food out, maybe?\"\n\nHer eyes went wide when I asked her. Then—suddenly—without a word she bolted up the stairs and slammed the door to her room shut.\n\nAnd that was when I decided to take action.\n\nSomething terrible was going on here—and I was going to find out what.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThree days later, the package came. I greedily ripped it open and shook out the contents.\n\nA long, thin key. Designed to fit into the holes in home doorknobs and unlock them from the outside.\n\nI crept up the stairs, even though I knew Grandma was watching TV with the volume full blast. Then I crouched in front of her door and slid the key into the hole.\n\nAfter a few minutes of fumbling, I heard the *click.*\n\nI pushed the door open.\n\nThe stench hit me like a truck. Fetid, sour decay that made me want to vomit. I frantically waved it away—and then I saw what was on the bed.\n\n*No.*\n\nA body. Blue-skinned, stiff, lifeless. One arm hanging over the side of the bed, white fingers dangling towards the ground.\n\nNot just any body.\n\nMy *Grandma's.*\n\nA soft sound came from behind me. \"I'm so sorry, dear,\" my Grandma's voice whispered in my ear.\n\nBut when I turned around, the hallway was [empty.](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)",

        "text": "When I was younger, my friends and I used to explore the woods behind our neighborhood. It was our favorite place to play and imagine, but there was always something eerie about it. We would hear strange whispers in the wind, see shadows darting through the trees, and feel like we were being watched.\n\nOne summer evening, we decided to take our adventure a little further into the woods. We wandered deeper and deeper until we stumbled upon an old abandoned house. It was tall and looming with broken windows and creaky shutters. We were scared but curious, so we pushed open the rusty gate and stepped inside.\n\nThe house was dusty and dark, but we could see that someone had been living there recently. There were dirty dishes in the sink and clothes thrown haphazardly on the floor. We searched the first floor, but found nothing of interest. It wasn't until we climbed the stairs that we heard the whispers again. They were louder this time, and seemed to be coming from behind a locked door at the end of the hallway.\n\nWe approached the door slowly, unsure of what we would find. When we reached it, we noticed that there was a keyhole. We peered inside and saw a small room with an old wooden chest in the center. It looked ancient, and the whispers were coming from inside. We knew we shouldn't open it, but curiosity got the best of us.\n\nWe found a way to pick the lock and opened the chest. Inside were several old books and a small, ornate mirror. We picked up the mirror and gazed into it. At first, we saw our own reflections, but then the image began to shift. The room behind us faded away and was replaced by a dark, shadowy forest. We could hear the whispers again, louder this time, and they seemed to be coming from the mirror itself.\n\nSuddenly, something grabbed us from behind and pulled us into the mirror. We were falling through darkness, unable to move or scream. When we landed, we were in a different part of the woods, but it was different. The trees were twisted and gnarled, the sky was dark, and the air was thick with the same eerie whispers we had heard before.\n\nWe tried to find our way back, but the forest seemed to shift and change around us, leading us in circles. We were lost, and the whispers were getting louder and more frantic. We knew we had to find a way out before it was too late.\n\nMinutes turned into hours as we wandered through the whispering woods, surviving on whatever we could find. We never found a way out, but we did find something else. We found the source of the whispers. It was a group of ghostly figures, who had been trapped in the woods for centuries. They had been waiting for someone to open the chest and release them.\n\nWe were their only hope of escape. They told us to take the mirror and use it to break the curse. We did as we were told, and when we shattered the mirror, we were suddenly back in the abandoned house. We stumbled out into the sunlight, shaken and disoriented, but alive.\n\nFrom that day on, we never ventured into the whispering woods again. We didn't need to. We had seen enough to last a lifetime.",

        "text": "The staff at the gay conversion camp could never crack my brothers and I.  They did everything they could for the past two months.  Waterboarding, electrostatic therapy, the works.  Alpha and Charlie always stuck by my side, keeping me in one piece.  The staff were already growing impatient at our persistence.  Things were looking up for us.  We all thought they would have given up on us by that point.  \n\nUntil they introduced us to “Project Muzzle.”\n\n\\---\n\nThe remaining uncured boys, my brothers and I included, all woke up strapped to metal chairs where muscular thugs with the build of Sasquatches stood in front.  They threw punch after punch until our faces were at the point of caving in.  Our veins and muscles were beaten until all the colors of a hideous rainbow tinted our hides.  Dull scratches throbbed from key lime green infections, inflammation burning us up from the inside out.\n\n“Are they cured yet?” The headmaster bellowed from the back of the circular room.  As he strode towards the fluorescent lighting above our weary heads, he grabbed my chin and gave me an inspection.  His bright green eyes mirrored the deep machinations inside his head.\n\n“Nope.  We’ve given them all we’ve got!  Should we give them another beating?” One of the goons said.\n\n“Not this time.  I think it’s time we introduced them to ‘Project Muzzle.’  Bring out the serum!”\n\nI frowned a bit, looking over at Alpha, who was in the seat next to me.  He gave a nod.  I feigned a snicker at the scientist, just as I Alpha taught me.  In reality, fear rattled down my bones, making my facial muscles weaken.\n\nWhat exactly was “Project Muzzle?”\n\nOne of the nurses came over, her high heels clicking against the linoleum, holding white liquids in beakers.  She took each one of the blanched fluids, poured them into IV drips and stuck needles into our arms.  With the speed of a turtle in corn syrup, the concoctions slowly slunk down the plastic tubing and entered our veins.\n\n“If the beatings won’t force you to convert…” The headmaster’s words slunk into my head with the viscosity of tar while my surroundings melted into a slush.\n\nAll at once, Alpha and Charlie slumped down in exhaustion and were lifted by the workers.  My eyelids grew heavy, and I fell asleep.\n\n“…then true fear will.”\n\n\\---\n\nThe temperature of the cold tile woke us all up.  The rest of the boys stood in the middle of a four way intersection filled with a labyrinth of halls and doors.  Up above was a glass dome shielded by a metal cover.  Tables and chairs surrounded us in piles.\n\nThis wasn’t any area of the conversion camp I’d ever seen before.  It was wider, more spacious, and reeked of ammonia and other chemicals.\n\n“Alpha!  Charlie!  You guys alright?” I asked.\n\n“Yeah.  Just disoriented.”\n\nCLICK!  In an eye blink, the lights flicked off.\n\nGunmetal flashlights clacked to the floor.  The other nurses retreated back into the darkness, the clacking of their feet being the only indication of their presence.  A door slammed from the back.  We all turned to the metal barrier, hearing the tumblers clink in place.\n\n“The final test is simple: it ends when we think you’ve been cured.  If you crack, we free you.  Otherwise…” a voice croaked on an unseen intercom.\n\nAlpha, Charlie and I felt our jaws involuntarily drop.  With one glance, we knew what we needed to do.  Our first instinct was to head straight, scanning our flashlights back and forth in a manner like that of a lighthouse.  Except for the pitter-pat of bare feet, all was quiet.\n\nAlpha took the lead, putting his hands up in defense while Charlie guarded the back.  Rusty air-conditioning units clunked to the tune of their slowly rotating blades.  Their breathing was deafening compared to the dangerous silence that lingered through the hallways.\n\nPat, pat, pat…Footsteps from an unknown source.  We shone our lights in unison, waiting for whatever was lurking inside to pop up.  \n\nIt never came out.  Alpha gave us a jolt to the side, signaling us to keep going.\n\nA T intersection blocked our path.  Pressing our backs against the walls, we scanned the left and right.\n\n“Which path should we take?” Charlie whispered.  \n\nI put a finger to my mouth.  Alpha and I stuck our thumbs in opposite directions.  To break the tie, we did a round of rock-paper-scissors.  My rock beat his scissors; right was my choice.  Charlie held his ground, holding the light down the left hallway.\n\nSomething swung open with a mighty clatter in front of us.  We froze in place, goosebumps forming on our sweaty skin.\n\n“What was that?!” a kid shouted way off from the other side.\n\nWe rushed over to the source of the sound.  A cell greeted us on the left side.  Our flashlights couldn’t pierce the thick darkness on the inside.  The door was sealed shut like a fresh jar of peanut butter.  I touched the bars, feeling their cool surface, but backed in case if something was inside.  Rumbling slid through the cavernous room through the slits.\n\nPeering our heads closer, a deep, distorted, repetitive gargling sound rumbled through the gates.  Tiny pale dots glanced back at us.  We fell back, getting away from the gate.\n\n“No!  You don’t understand!  I’m cured!” a kid pleaded way off, hidden from our point of view.  The alien chatters and clicks grew louder.\n\nThe intercom spat out static followed by a frazzled voice on the other line.  “We don’t believe you.”\n\n“Someone fucking help me!” the boy screamed in terror.  Squelching and tearing rippled through the hallways.  Our backs straightened in terror.  Turning around to the scuffling of something to the left, the door behind us somehow opened up without making a sound.  The armada of shuffling drew nearer, but nothing was there.  A shiver developed on my spine.\n\n“Run,” Alpha whispered.\n\nBolting out like a bat out of hell, we ran down random paths without rhyme or reason, hoping that whatever was back there would lose us.  Charlie kept glancing behind us, still keeping his pace.  Various junk clattered everywhere in our escape.  Whatever was behind us was gaining on us meter, by meter, by meter, even though its presence wasn’t clear.\n\nWe hit another intersection where shuffling blocked our path.  Shadows peered out from a corner.  Thimble eyes beamed at us from the shadows.  We sprinted down the other path, hearing rustling down there, too.\n\nMy head wheeled around every which way.  I bit my lip.  Everywhere I looked, there was something lurking in each path.  Something reached out from the distance, scratching my elbow.  Alpha barged in the way, shoving us forward, away from whatever was in front of us.\n\n“What are we going to do?!” I hissed.\n\nAlpha pointed to some junk close by, a mass lurking not far away from it.  “Hide there.”\n\n“There’s something out there!  We can’t just out run it!”\n\n“Then we have to get creative.”  He dove towards the junk pile, frantically waving his hands.  Charlie and I reluctantly agree, following his orders and trying not to scream.  Alpha covers himself with a sheet, while Charlie hides under the cover of a cardboard box.  I cower inside a small box, leaving the open side facing the wall.\n\nMoist hands clomped up to us; a shadow darker than a black hole overtook what little light was left in the passage.  I pursed my lips and clenched my jaw shut.  The guttural moans of whatever was outside resonated.  It gave one last snort before ambling away, its presence growing fainter and fainter.\n\nWe all waited for about five minutes.  \n\nThe sound of a sheet flopping to the ground alerted us that the coast was clear.\n\nThe air grew heavier than lead all around me.  I didn’t even bother escaping my hiding place.  Everywhere around me, I could hear the sounds growing louder and louder.  I cover my head with my hands, hyperventilating.  My vision blurred.  Despite the box facing the wall, I could see visions behind me.  What if those monsters came back?  What if my brothers were going to abandon me?  Was their support all just a trick and they were only using me as bait?\n\n“No, no, no, no, no…” I mumbled.  Alpha removes the box from behind me, holding his hands out sympathetically.\n\n“Bravo?” He said, concerned.\n\nAll I had to do was shout that I’ve given up, and it would all be over.  No, I couldn’t bring attention to my brothers and leave them to die.  I folded my lips behind my teeth, trying to hold in my emotions like Atlas holding up the Earth.  My eyes clench tighter and tighter.\n\n“WE GIVE UP-“Alpha covered my mouth with his hand, embracing me in a hug and silencing me.  My hot tears poured down his shoulder.\n\n“Shh…It’s alright, I’ve got you…” \n\n“I got you all into this mess…Mom and Dad wouldn’t have sent us to this hellhole if I weren’t an abomination!” I sobbed.\n\n“That’s not true.  That’s not true at all.  You never were.  You’re perfectly fine and you always will be.”  He soothingly holds onto my clavicles.  “Listen.  You’ve got us by our side.  We all fought through the abuse at this nightmare of a place.  Remember what we are all fighting for?  Just hang in there!  We will all get out and everything will go back the way it once was.”\n\nWiping the last of my tears on my sleeve, I scrunched my brow and nod.\n\n“Now let’s bust out of here.” Alpha said, shaking a fist encouragingly.\n\nCharlie guided us forward, taking random turn after random turn.  A form stood right before us like a gray teratoma before vanishing into the night.\n\n“Did you see that?” I said to Alpha, blinking a few times.  The phantasm blended in with the cover of darkness.  Alpha thrust his light into the area in front.\n\nNothing came up.\n\n“Must have been your imagination.  We’ve got to find an exit.” He declared.\n\nAlthough there wasn’t a presence in sight for nearly thirty minutes, we didn’t want to risk anything leaping out.  More gray specters formed here and there, popping out around corners.  The darkness distorted my vision too much.\n\nEventually, all three of us reached a corner, where a map of the facility was, left in paper.  Alpha beamed me a smile and we all embraced each other in a hug.  We were all one step closer to getting out of this facility.\n\nI put my hand on my neck.  “Hey Alpha?”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“You guys have always been there for me and now that the heat has died down a bit, I just want to thank you all for supporting me like this.  More than just defending me back there.  You helped me fight back and regain my willpower.  But I want to ask you all one thing: why have you been resisting my parent’s control after all this time?  Like I said, you wouldn’t even be in this mess if it wasn’t for me!”\n\nAlpha and Charlie’s smiles drooped.  They each mouthed the word “yeah.”  Alpha reached out.  “Because I couldn’t stand watching you get hurt and be treated like trash.  As the oldest, it is my duty to help look out for you all.  If I just protected Charlie, then what kind of brother am I?”\n\n“Yeah, our parents always favored you two.  I guess you’re a rare case of an apple falling far from the tree.” I snarked, grinning.\n\nAll three of us laughed.  Charlie chimed in.  “Remember all those stories I had told you about me being beat up in school by those jerks?”\n\n“Yeah?”\n\n“I knew what it felt like to suffer, and you’ve suffered far more than any of us.  It’s the worst feeling in the world.  I don’t want anyone to experience the pain that I went through.”\n\nI thanked them for helping me get this far.  Wiping the dust off my pants, we took a sharp right.\n\nSLAP!  It came from the floor, drawing our attention and dissolving the brotherly moment.  I spun around, seeing the horrid mangled body of a boy no older than fifteen.  His black hair was matted together with blood seeping down from his scalp like the glaze on a cherry frosted donut.  Every bone in his now frail and mutilated body was left in nothing but splinters that stuck out from his skin.  With each reach, his bones cracked even louder.  \n\nHe futilely reached out to us, trying to hang on to life, screaming until his mouth was bleeding.  I double blinked in horror.  Charlie put his hand in front of us.\n\nThen, he was gone.  I looked down into the distance, seeing if whatever was in the plaster labyrinth had seized him.  Back on the floor, there wasn’t a drop of blood.  \n\nNo fingernail scratches, no broken bone pieces, not even a silhouette that indicated that the boy was even there in the first place.\n\nIt didn’t take us long to figure out what was up.\n\nThe fluid that the nurses gave us.  It had some hallucinogen in it.  This didn’t make any sense, though.  Some of the apparitions were real.  Where they?  The cage way back near our starting point was real.  I could feel its coolness against the palms of my hands.  And the scratch against my elbow.  That was real.\n\nWe looked back at the map.  All of the locations suddenly shifted around before our eyes as if we were in a maze straight out of a Dungeons and Dragons campaign.\n\n“What are we going to do?” I asked Alpha.\n\nMy eldest brother crumples up the paper in frustration.  “Damn those fucking nurses!  We’re going to have to charge in blindly, using what we can of the map.  Hopefully, an exit is here somewhere.”\n\nJust like that, we ran off.  \n\n\\---\n\nAt first, it seemed simple, all we had to do was just remember what the map looked like before the visions clouded our retinas.  None of us could decipher the twisting ink on the paper that slithered around and wriggled in a snake-ish manner.  \n\nPraying for the best was the only option; taking an occasional turn here, another one there, and picking paths at random.  False pathways animated to life, only to disappear back in with the drywall.\n\nThe liquid darkness grew more virulent the longer we stood around.  I’d shine my flashlight around in a frenzy, hoping to catch any of the apparitions in the act but never succeeding.  Alpha constantly studied the map, hoping that none of the paths changed and that everyone was going the right way.  Hooks of fear dug into my veins, shredding them with every path we took.\n\nAnd then, the exit stood before our eyes, just down the end of a long hallway.  A neon red sign hovered above a complex door I’ve only seen locking bank vaults.  We all rubbed our eyes, hoping it wasn’t another hallucinogen induced trick.  After standing there for minutes, exposing ourselves to whatever was inside, we got a closer look.\n\nNot wanting to take any chances, Charlie checked if something was behind us.  Nothing was there.\n\nHe suddenly grew pale when he looked again, the aura around him colder than ice.\n\n“What’s wrong?” I asked.  The only thing Charlie did was point his light at something off where the exit was.\n\nOur heads craned back in unison.  The neon lights of the exit sign were snuffed out, hastily replaced with hundreds of white, pupilless eyes attached to an unseen form.\n\nAll of us screamed at the top of our lungs.  My brothers took off without a second thought.  Staring down at the beast, legs glued to the floor was the only thing I could think of.\n\nI clenched my eyes again.  All it took was for me to crack and my brothers and I would be saved.  The black mass was still inside, staring directly at us.  \n\nOr I could just let myself die.  \n\nMy skin froze at the hairs, the pores damping my skin.  Alpha grabbed onto my shoulders, shaking me out of my funk.\n\n“Snap out of it!  We’re so close!  Don’t let our efforts all be for nothing!” He bellowed.\n\nWhen his words hit my eardrums, my blood ran hot.  My nostrils flared with steam hotter than a Yellowstone geyser.  \n\nI couldn’t just let myself die right now.  They sacrificed their lives to protect me.\n\nNow it was time for me to protect myself for their sake.\n\nWe blindly scampered from the apparition, moving towards the back where another beast came in, missing us by inches.  Still keeping track of where the exit was, we took an immediate right.  A false wall.  We keep running until our backs met against a dead end.  One of the pathways suddenly opened.  This time, it wasn’t fake.  To our luck, nothing blocked our path, but the beast was still behind us.  Alpha barged against the door before cranking the tumblers open.\n\nIt stopped for a bit.\n\n“OPEN THE DOOR!” Charlie and I screamed.\n\nAlpha strained against the stuck lever.  “It won’t budge!  Help me out!”\n\nFollowing his command, we clenched at the handles, twisting it clockwise until we heard a click; we sped out the door, and slammed the heavy bastard shut.\n\nThe grass crunched against my bare feet, freezing the soles in the dead, starless night.  All of us flopped to the ground finally free of the nightmare.  All three of us sighed, letting all the stress pent up from our escape leave our bodies like steam rising from a boiling pot.\n\n“I told you we would all make it out.” Alpha huffed.\n\nI turned to my younger brother.  “Charlie? What say you?”\n\nI blinked a few times and just like that, he was gone.  Scanning the nearby forest in front of the prison, he was nowhere to be found.  Slowly, I turned my head towards the outside of the cinderblock reinforced facility.\n\nMy heart sunk.  “Oh no…”  Without hesitating, I take off into the maze once more.  Something tugged on my arm.  Alpha.\n\n“Bravo!  Don’t go back in there!  Let me save him!” He pleaded.\n\n“I’m not letting you go in there without me!  Let’s get him together!”  All the fear left in me was now gone; it’d vanished like smoke in the wind.  In an instant, we pried open the door, running straight down, taking countless turn after countless turn.  We did everything we could to make sure we knew precisely where we were in the labyrinth.\n\nThen, a scream echoed through the barren chambers from the west.  Right down the end of a corner was Charlie, squirming in the grasp of clawed bony hands.  Ebony skeletons, fused and packed tighter than tree rings, cracked and shifted under the pressure of each other, pressing and scratching away the chipping wall paint.\n\n“You’ve helped me all my life.  Always been there for me.” I clenched a fist, charging right into the conglomerate’s form.  “Now it’s my turn to return the favor!”  I ripped my younger brother out of the clutches of the skeleton cluster, deep scratches from the bones cutting his arms.  He got up, brushing off the blood from his hands and extremities.  At the last second, a superficial slash from the claws of the beast went right across my chest.\n\nThis was not a fake.  That beast was the real deal.\n\nWe bolted for the door.  False walls passed by us, bony hands reached out and clawed at the ground and tore at the plaster. \n\nThe nurses’ tricks couldn’t fool us anymore.  \n\nThe beast shrieked in rage as we forced the door shut, its spectral form pulsing back into the labyrinth.  It pounded against the reinforced door for several minutes, its anger venting through the forest as we ran through the deep brush lining the prison.\n\nWe continued running for several miles until our hips were at the point of shattering.  Soon, we finally come to a stop, running into a police station not too far from the edge of the woods.  Filing a police report was a no go, we could never get a name of that facility.  It had to be classified, somehow.\n\nThe police sent us to a hotel for us to stay for the night before we could collect our things at home.  For the rest of the night, we didn’t say a word to each other.  At one point, we gazed at our beaten faces, hoping we could find some joy in our faces.  All that showed up were looks of tiredness and worry.  And despite the luxury of the soft beds we slept on, nothing seemed right.  The only thing that brought me comfort was that we were all together and that I thought this nightmare would be all over.\n\n\\---\n\nHow wrong I was.  The first thing we did was sneak back into our house while our parents were asleep, reclaiming all our stuff and hitting the old dusty trail.  We ran off, far away from our parents’ house until we settled down at a homeless shelter.  But despite all the trauma we went through, we still stuck together.\n\nAll is not well, however.\n\nIf we stared off for a while, we could still see the shadow beasts still lurking right outside the outskirts of the city.  Whenever we went to investigate, there wouldn’t be a trace of their presence.  The only thing that brought me reassurance was that I knew that the true monster was still in the plaster labyrinth.  I did slam the door on it, preventing it from escaping, afterall.\n\nEvery now and then, my brothers would be right beside me, only to teleport to a location they weren’t in before.  Sometimes I even think that my brothers are still in the maze with the behemoth, possible even being murdered as I type this.\n\nWhat did the nurses inject in me, anyway?\n\nAll I know is that it never left my body, and I don’t think it ever will.",

        "text": "The 9th of June. Historical day for some, ordinary day for others, and birthday to many. However, in the village I was born and raised in, it is the day of a big event that went from a strange supernatural occurrence to the most feared phenomenon in our community. It is said to have started in 1931. A whole day or 24 hours during which everybody and everything just shut down, and as a result, no device could never be used to document what events exactly occur in that time frame. You read correctly, I wrote events, because on the next day, everyone usually wakes up to a surprise that can be either very funny or utterly disastrous.\n\nFrom the senior residents' testimonies, after the first blackouts, people used to just wake up in random places with no recollection of how they found themselves there. Things then evolved, taking a lighter tone, and people began finding themselves in bars, in other villagers' houses upon waking up, just to give a few examples. The most common occurrence was called the after party, as most people would apparently gather at a random place, feast all throughout the blackout and wake up the next day with hangovers, sometimes half naked and again no memories about the events. Those events gave birth to very funny stories and speculations that helped people to cope with the strangeness of the blackout, until things took a much darker tone.\n\nUnfortunately, the most recent blackouts from 1983, introduced the whole village to a new form of terror. Honestly, just imagine being on the verge of passing out or sleeping, not knowing if you or your loved ones will ever wake up. The funny stuff was still happening, but along with very terrifying things. One time, a woman drowned in another woman's bathtub, another time, several children went missing and were never found, again just to give a few examples. There was at least one death to expect and discover after every blackout from 1983. The most gruesome case was that of a girl named [Hazel](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/115y6au/last_week_i_would_have_become_either_a_murderer/) who woke up with a knife in her hand, and next to the eviscerated body of a woman. Following the incident, she was forced to flee the village for good.\n\nBecause of those deaths, the villagers started to believe evil supernatural forces to be the culprits and began locking or even chaining themselves before every blackout to no avail. In 2015, my parents, my older sister Vivian, my younger sister Carla and myself Terrence, decided to try something new. Worried about us going out, or anyone getting in our house during the blackout, we put salt at every door and window hoping to stay safe. For extra precaution, we locked ourselves in our respective rooms and slid the key under the door, except for my father who opted for the bathroom. We then patiently waited for midnight and the blackout to strike, each of us provided with a fairly large plastic salt container.\n\nLying on my bed, my eyes closed, my then 13 years old self recall thinking that I never had to wait that long for a blackout and my nervousness kept on increasing by the minute. I then tried to read the time on my phone but it was suddenly switched off. I noticed a strange darkness surrounding me, and it did not take me long to realize that the electricity was gone in the whole village. I retrieved my flashlight but it would not switch on, just like any other device in my possession. I felt perfectly normal and wondered if I would just wake up the next morning without remembering anything, or if maybe the 84th blackout did not just occur at all or only affected electricity and electronic devices. This is when I heard loud bangs on a door as one of us tried to kick it open. After at least five kicks, the person had succeeded, and I thought it could be my father coming to our rescue after realizing that the blackout did not occur.\n\n\"Dad?\" I called, not getting any response. \"Dad is that you?\" I asked again. I could hear the person walking calmly towards my door. \"I think we're still lucid.\" I said before hearing the person kick on my door. I jumped back, surprised by such a behavior while the person kept on kicking and successfully broke the door at the fourth attempt. I could not believe my eyes. It was Carla, my 9 years old little sister.\n\n\"You.\" She spoke, with a deep and adult male voice. \"You're not a vessel. Why? Why are you not a fucking vessel?\" She asked, but I could not answer, paralyzed by her shining white eyes. \"How did you do that?\"\n\n\"Carla? Carla what— what's that?\" I managed to ask.\n\n\"Carla is unavailable you stupid piece of shit.\" She replied, to my absolute bewilderment.\n\n\"Wh— what?\"\n\n\"You broke the covenant. You broke the fucking deal. The punishment for your crime is death.\"\n\nShe tried approaching but got repelled by the line of salt surprisingly still intact in front of the doorframe. I watched her walk away and come back with a knife in one hand and a bucket of water in the other. I grabbed my salt container and was ready to storm out through the window. Carla understood my intentions and threw the knife at me, missing her target by just a few inches. While I opened the window, I heard her pour the water to remove the line of salt preventing her from entering. I jumped out and started running aimlessly in the dark of the night.\n\n\"OUTLANDER!!!\" I heard Carla scream behind me with rage in that deep male voice.\n\nAnimalistic roars resounded in all the buildings surrounding me as I saw multiple pairs of white shining eyes appearing on the windows. I kept on running, wondering if this night would be my very last in this world.",

        "text": "I work a night shift as a guard in my local hospital. We work in shifts because the hospital's entrance can't be left unguarded. So we work in a 12/36 hours type of thing. It is a very easy job. The part I generally cover is the surgical center, and because it is the night shift people don't generally do surgery at night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe sometimes get one or another patient. And the general quiet and easy night became a horrifying nightmare. But that's another story. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow... The entrance has a little room( it's more like a cell really.) Where I generally have to stay. It doesn't even have a bathroom, so sometimes I can leave to do my necessities. But in this room, there's a toy of the mascot of the hospital. The mascot is a black hound, just like the ones that guard the cemeteries. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeah... I also think that a hospital having a mascot is kinda silly, but as long as the paycheck is coming I won't be doing anything about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe weird part is... The mascot is new. I have been working there for about four to five years. The mascot and subsequently the toy in my room just came some months ago. It simply appears in my room. On one shift it wasn't there and on the next just simply was in the middle of the central desk. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I asked my supervisors they just said. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Nothing like a hound to guard and protect us from the evils of the world.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would say this toy is not out of the ordinary, except it has a little piece of gold fused with it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore you say anything I have thought about stealing and getting a little more cash, but I had a bad feeling about doing it so. Unfortunately, my coworkers didn't come to this conclusion. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEver since this toy came I got a new coworker every week or so. The new ones that come are normal for the most part, but they all take a lot of interest in the toy. We have to make sure everything is ok when delivering to the workplace. This means I have to make sure everything is clean and in its place, by the time I end up doing all that the next guys almost always have already come. So with the little time we interact, we can chat a little. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I have said earlier, they are changing every shift. That time I decided to make sure to know why. I made a friend in the camera department and they made sure to show me the camera footage. But a feeling inside me told me that I shouldn't let anyone besides me see. I told them to hand me the footage and I checked out at my home later. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI watched it and my coworker simply stole the dog toy. I thought \"whoa... That is it... They are being fired just because of a toy.\" I could have just stopped and made no mind out of it, but some things weren't clicking. Yeah stealing is treated with total termination in this hospital, but how did they find out so quickly, how was everyone doing the same, who they managed to have that many dogs... So unfortunately I keep watching and when was the night shift again ( not mine shift, but the one that is the night before.) When that other coworker, that I didn't know at the time, was sleeping the camera cut off for just the slightest moment. When it is back to my surprise the toy was back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt that moment I froze in place and a vivid terror covered all over my body. That terror wasn't like any normal terror that I have felt. It was as... It was alive... And I could feel... That it was telling me something... I don't know how, but I knew that the terror was telling me to not say anything about this to anyone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I could delete this or recompose myself I checked the video once again and to my surprise, that coworker have awoken, and what was more terrifying... He didn't act surprised to see the toy that have just appeared out of nowhere. This told me to keep an eye on it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo in the night, I got a spy camera that I could connect to my phone and waited for my shift to start. I was going to place the camera directly on the toy, but the terror feeling come back. I, for the better, decided to put the camera in the new coworker I would receive today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rest of the shift would have been normal if it wasn't for the fact that I couldn't get any sleep. It was the worst twelve hours of my life up to that point. When the new guy came I was met with q mix of relive, pity, and fear. I implanted him with the come and ran to my apartment. I could sleep for some time and was feeling ready for whatever was to come. I wasn't ready. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI checked the camera and it was online and working. The new guy was about to deliver the shift. It was the most normal delivery I have ever seen or made. But I was sure he had taken the toy with him. And as expected not even five minutes after he was off the hospital grounds he checked his right pocket to see the toy. I could make out a few of his words. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"...You... Power... House...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were others words in between but I believe, or better-put hope, that is something along the lines of... \"With you, I can pay the power bill, or even buy a house.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen he finally made it to his apartment I was greeted with an unpleasant surprise. His apartment was full of trash and trashy posters, the walls were very unpleasant to look at with a clock that was pointing at eight and thirty-one, which to my surprise is the correct hour. The floor is filled with holes and in the ceiling, I could see the plumbing. I could tell that it smelled like sewage and rotten eggs. Then he put the toy on the middle table and there it begins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis apartment fell over his head, yet he was alive. The floor crumbled under his feet, yet he wasn't falling. The trash was burned and destroyed, yet I could still pick up the sewage smell. The walls have gone missing too. There was just an empty void of darkness and terror. The only things that were still human enough to make out were the new guy and the toy, until... It begins to grow... Not like normal humans know to grow. It was like it grows by making other things small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis sent me to my knees and even the new guy screamed in terror, but it hasn't stopped. The toy lost all its cute and silly features. It is now just a dark glowing eye, if I can even call that thing an eye, and a hand. The mascot now just touches the new guy and the nightmare vision is now over, but the apartment is clean. The desk where the mascot was is gone, the mascot is gone. But it's not just this, the furniture is completely different. The paint on the walls had more bright color, the ceiling is in perfect shape and the floor is as smooth as baby skin. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI now have the view of a casal that picks up the camera. They were extremely confused. Just as I was. I looked at the time and to my surprise, it displayed 20:32. That whole scene just took one second. But it felt... No, it was definitely at least ten minutes in there. I swear it was a lot longer than I made it look likes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that, I immediately ran to the hospital to check the paycheck account, and it was just as I feared. The new guy wasn't in there. He never had worked in that hospital ever. In fact, it was a completely different person, and that person had been working on the shift next to mine for the past year. That is what the reports say. That new guy doesn't exist anymore. No credit card, no family, no birth certificate, no NOTHING! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want to work there anymore. But I don't have any other choice. Do I?",

        "text": "For those of you who don't watch tiktok, there's been a trend going around with some creepy videos. The video usually starts with a person doing something normal, with an audio that says something like \"If you see another person that looks identical to you, run away and hide.\" Then it'll cut to a creepy duplicate of said person usually peaking from a closet or around the corner. \n\n  I don't really make videos that often, but this looked like a trend I'd have a little bit of fun with, so about a week ago, I made my own video. \n\n    My friends and I were having a couple drinks while one of them helped me film the duplicate part. We all laughed a little bit about the end part and how creepy I looked, but something about it unsettled me a little bit more than it should have. I just had this pit in my gut, an overwhelming sense of dread that made me nauseas. \n\n  The night eventually ended and my friends went home for the night. I took my dog out one last time for and then laid down for bed and turned my tv on for background noise. \n\n   I tossed and turned for while, still a bit on edge, but I eventually dozed off to a random King Of The Hill episode.\n\n  I woke up to static coming from my TV,  I shifted my eyes to look at the time. *\"3:06AM\"* the bright alarm clock beamed. \n\n  I heard my closet door slowly creak open. My eyes darted toward the closet, my body and limbs trembled in fear, but were unable to move. I watched in horror as I saw a hand begin to creep out from the closet and wrapped itself around the doorframe. \n\n  My heart began beating faster and my breathing became rapid. The creature slowly started crawling from it's hiding space.The light from the tv illuminated a wide, toothy grin as the face came more into focus. \n\n   To my horror the person hiding in my closet was a duplicate version of me. Except she had dark circles under her eyes, and a smile too wide to be human. Her eyes were glassy and dead. There was also something off about her. Something dark. \n\n  She stood at the foot of my bed just smiling and watching me. She waved at me, and at that moment I shot up in bed, pouring sweat and gasping for air. My dog nuzzled and licked my hand to comfort me. \n\n  I told myself it was just sleep paralysis, but I was still disturbed, but tried to go about my day as best as I could. The next morning however, I couldn't explain what I found. \n\n  I walked into the kitchen to grab some breakfast and saw a note on the counter in my handwriting. It read /\"I will replace you. I am the better you.\"/ over and over again. I was terrified, no, I still *am* terrified because I couldn't recall writing anything like that. \n\n  I called my friend, and she tried to reassure me that I was just a little freaked out because of the nightmare I had, and that maybe I had written the note half asleep and just didn't remember it. \n\n  It didn't really help, in fact, it made me feel like I was losing my mind, and maybe I am, but something happened a couple nights ago that made me get a hotel. \n\n  I awoke to a loud crash coming from inside my house. My dog was barking and growling like crazy, so I grabbed the baseball bat from my closet, and began tiptoeing down the hallway. I flipped the light switch, but the light wouldn't come on. \n\n  I peered down the hall as my eyes adjusted to the darkness. In the dim moonlight streaming in from the window, I could see my utility closet at the end of the hallway was open. My blood turned to ice as I called out into the dark. \n\n   \"I-if anyone's in here, just know I'm calling the police!\" I stammered out. I heard a small chuckled come from the closet and then a voice- my voice, called my dogs name and I watched in shocked and my dog darted out from behind me and stopped in front of the door and began growling. \n\n  *\"NYLA NO!\"* I screamed, but I was too late. A pair of arms reached out from the closet and grabbed Nyla, pulling her into the closet. The door slammed shut and I heard her yelp. \n\n  I sprinted toward the door, and frantically tried to open it, but it wouldn't budge. I turned to run and grab my phone to call 911, and I heard the door swing open behind me. Out walked my huskie, seemingly unharmed.\n\n  I rushed toward the closet and pulled the cord for the light, but the closet was empty except for the Hvac and water heater. \n\n  I didn't want to stay in that house any longer, so I grabbed a few things and Nyla and checked into a hotel near by where I've been staying since. \n\n  I don't know what to do. I can't go back to that house by myself, and Nyla hasn't been acting right. She's been growling at me, and even bit my arm the other day, and I had to get stitches. I don't understand. She's never been aggressive before. \n\n  I took her to the vet yesterday and they said she's physically in perfect condition, but there's something not quite right about her eyes. It's like she's staring straight through me.",

I feel myself slipping more and more as the days go by. Kind of like when you’re sick, you know? How you’ll be for the most part just kind of woozy and then out of nowhere you’re completely overwhelmed by the nausea? How you go from functional, lucid human being to some shriveling pile of skin and bones hunched over a toilet? \n\nIt’s kind of like that. Kind of like being sick.\n\n“Knock Knocks” dead. I killed him. Well, I didn’t *really* kill him, but he’s dead because of me. So, what’s the difference? \n\nI took your guy’s advice. Who’d have thought a bunch of strangers on the internet would have the answers that our established police force didn’t? I know when I’m wrong, and I can admit when I’m wrong, and I was wrong to dismiss some of you so quickly. I apologize for that. For what it’s worth. Maybe nothing now. Maybe everything if you listen to my warning. I owe it to you.\n\nI feel myself slipping more and more as the days go by. Kind of like when you’re sick, you know?\n\nShit, that’s right. You do know. I just told you.\n\nNo one. NO ONE could find “Knock Knock.” It wasn’t for lack of trying though. The police looked everywhere. Every known homeless hangout, every cheap motel with crack pipes in the sink, every abandoned house and wooded lot. He’d just come around with these horrible gifts and completely vanish. Like the Santa Claus no one was excited to see. \n\nBut when you’re afraid to even go to the bathroom. When you’re stuck in the darkness of your house for days on end, hardly eating, hardly sleeping. Not even wanting to leave your chair out of fear for your life all you can do is think right? And I did A LOT of freaking thinking. A lot of reading tooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n\nMostly just thinking. Mostly just thinking.\n\nBut then it hit me! \n\nNo one knows where “Knock Knock” goes, but you ALWAYS know where “Knock Knock” is! It’s that fucking laugh of his. That endless, awful laugh he laughs. You can hear it from a mile away. \n\nAnd two nights ago, I heard it!\n\nIt was probably 2:30 in the morning. I don’t know maybe earlier, maybe later, maybe earlier. It’s all blurring together now and it’s hard to focus. \n\nI heard him coming up my quiet little street. Waking everyone up with that wild cackle he’s got, and I don’t know. Something just came over me. I don’t know if it was fear, or courage, or desperation, but something in me knew that it was time to act. \n\nI acted alright. \n\nI came running out of my house like a bat out of hell. All I had was my dad’s old .38. Didn’t have my pants on, or my shoes. Same shirt I’ve been wearing for almost a week now, but you can’t blame me, and you can’t blame me for still being in the same shirt as I type this out to you guys. It’s just kind of like when you’re sick, you know? How you’ll just be kind of woozy and then . . .\n\nYes! You know! You know! You know! You know!\n\n“Knock Knock” was on my neighbors’ porch. He hadn’t knocked on the door yet, and I couldn’t see what was in his hands, but I didn’t care. I went sprinting across the street and grabbed him by that stupid mildew-soaked trench coat and yanked him around with every bit of strength I had. \n\nHave you ever heard someone laughing while caught off guard at the same time? Creepy fucking guy. \n\nHe grabbed at me. Sort of instinctually I guess, and kind of pushed as I pulled and we both went tumbling through the porches wooden banister and over the side. A good four- or five-foot drop. I don’t know how I managed to do it, but I was able to sort of spin around as we were in that kind of free fall state. When we hit the ground I was on top of him, and my ears were ringing. I guess there was a moment when we initially hit the banister where that old .38 just kind of went off in my hand. \n\nI didn’t feel it in my hand as I tried to scramble myself from off of “Knock Knock”. So, I must’ve dropped it on the porch. \n\nI had to have dropped it on the porch, right? If I didn’t drop it on the porch, it would’ve been somewhere else.\n\nSorry, it’s just so hard to stay straight with this. It’s like when you’re sick you know. How you’ll be for the most part just a little woozy and then get completely overwhelmed by nausea? \n\nI won’t lie to you guys I turned around with the full anticipation of killing “Knock Knock” right there with my bare hands. Stomping on his head until there was nothing left. Punching those lazy eyes into the back of his skull. Strangling that incessant laughter forever. \n\nBut as it turns out I wouldn’t have to do any of that. \n\nI grabbed “Knock Knock” and could tell instantly something wasn’t right. He wasn’t laughing, and “Knock Knock” is NEVER not laughing. NEVER! As a matter of fact, he wasn’t doing anything. Those eyes were just staring emptily. One towards the neighbor’s backyard, and the other towards the street. I shook him, and then shook him again, but nothing changed. He didn’t gasp or blink or respond at all. \n\nBut as I shook him the second time I heard this weird sort of squishing sound, along with the hollow clunk of wood. \n\nI kind of turned him around, and then let go fast as I realized what had happened, and realized I had been shaking a corpse. \n\nSomehow when we fell off the banister. The wooden fixtures that held it all together went with us. When we hit the ground. I fell on top of “Knock Knock”, but “Knock Knock” fell on top of a few of those boards. \n\nOne of these boards was now stuck firmly into “Knock Knocks” head because if you build a banister, then you’re going to need . . . A LOT of nails. \n\nFUCKING NAILS! NAILS NAILS NAILS NAILS NAILS!\n\n“Knock Knock” Took my fate and made it his! Or I took my fate and made it “Knock Knocks” I don’t give a shit. Call it what you want, but when I turned at that last second, he caught all those nails to the back of his empty messed up little dome and knocked his lights out! They were for me! But he got it instead! \n\nI couldn’t believe it . . . I was alive! I won! I’d stopped this horrible prophet forever, and even if we were all going to die. We were going to die with some damn peace and quiet and willful ignorance! SALVATION!!! \n\nAt least those were my initial thoughts. As I looked over “Knock Knocks” lifeless body, that scraggly trench coat. Those ridiculously oversized boots, those ripped jeans. My eyes met his hand, and my heart dropped when I saw what he was holding. \n\nIn “Knock Knocks” dead hand was the unmistakable shape of an empty revolver cartridge. \n\nDann Orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr\n\nHe was a good neighbor. He was a good neighbor. \n\nHe must’ve come outside when he heard the commotion just as my revolver dropped and went off. Hit him square between the eyes. He never saw it coming. I’m a coward. Never called the police. The police weren’t over there for long when they saw the crime scene though. I mean why would they? There’s “Knock Knock” with an empty revolver cartridge in his hand. There’s Danny boy dead as a door nail, and there’s a revolver in between them with one spent casing. Pretty easy fix for an inadequate small town police force. Pretty easy fix. Pretty easy fix. Prettty easy\n\nYou’d think with “Knock Knock” being dead, and the final prophecy coming to fruition things would go back to normal right? Right? Except they’re not!!!!!!!! \n\nIt’s me now! It’s me now! I fucking know it. \n\nI keep getting these waves of just . . . I don’t even know. Waves of . . Insanity??? It’s like I just forget who I am. It’s like when you’re sick right? How for the most part you’re just a little woozy until the nausea takes over, and then you turn into this horrible writhing thing hunched over a toilet? \n\nThat’s me now. I feel myself slipping. I feel myself losing my grip on what’s real with every passssssing minute and I know there’s not much time. \n\nThere’s not much time, but you gotta know! \n\nYou gotta know……….\n\nThere’s someone in your town who knows things he shouldn’t . . .\n\nHelp me.",

        "text": "It’s been 20 years since my friends walked into those dank halls of the abandoned stone church, and never returned. My town wasn’t as small as some rural towns, but our population couldn’t have exceeded 5,000, and there was so much field to play in. the biggest curiosity among the school kids however was the abandoned church that sat lonely among the overgrown grass. \n\nKids at school would whisper that the church left money behind, and it was ripe for explores to pick, but we were all too scared to set foot near that place. There were “condemned” and “no trespassing” signs everywhere and when we asked the adults, they said that the building had asbestos and lead painting so it wasn’t safe to run around. \n\nBut October of 2003 my dumb ass friends decided that they were going to be the first to explore, pillage and uncover the truth of the desecrated grounds and that on the night of the full moon; Halloween, we would go there and see what the place had to offer. \n\nI declined as getting lung cancer at the age of 13 was a big no from me. my friends said I was chicken, but I wasn’t going in there, it was creepy and dangerous. They all went without me and that was the last night I ever saw them. for a whole year after that I was interrogated, by police, worried sick parents and even some local news press. \n\nI remember my friends fondly. Bella my old flame, smart and energetic. Kyle the dumb ass of our group, slow thinking but good meaning. Lastly there was Billy the only one in the group who I knew before we met Bella and Kyle. \n\nWhen I turned 27, I got out of the state and started a new life elsewhere, it didn’t really work out, things have been rough financially, I can’t get a girlfriend and am terrible at talking to people. Having nowhere else to go I go back to my old childhood town, because I was going to figure out once and for all what the hell happened to my friends. \n\nI drove through my town, it’s not to different from my childhood apart from the fact that a few businesses are now up for sale. Just like this place to stand still even when the rest of the world had gone to hell and back. Driving down the road, I saw it out my window, the church still standing with overgrowth and ominous energy. \n\nIt was still early in the morning, and I didn’t want to waste any sunlight, plus going into town meant I might run in to somebody and I wasn’t here to catch up with people. I drove down the dirt road that cut through the grassy plains and arrived at the cathedral with the rising sun behind it. I paused for a moment both to get my things and steal my courage. I grabbed a flashlight and a pistol I carry with me and walked in the direction of the church. I had my phone but wasn’t about to film myself trespassing.\n\nIt wasn’t enormous but it was definitely sizeable, I had three whole floors to get through including the basement. I opened the door and the light almost vanished in the Vanta black abyss on the other side. I turned on my flashlight and shinned it down the hall where the stairs to the second floor was, then I shined it on the stairs that lead to the subterranean level and then I turned my light to my side and shinned it down the gathering hall. \n\nThe pews still stood with bibles in the back sleeve of each row.  I walked through the murk and up to the stage where I could see a half empty bottle of wine and knocked over goblet.  \n\nI was starting to get a theory in my head but didn’t pay it thought, mostly because I didn’t want it to be true. after a short investigation of the hall, I went upstairs where the offices were. When I got to the second floor I found two doors, the first one I went through was full of documents and unremarkable stuff, just budgets and plans then I opened one of the office drawers incredibly enough I found money, stack of Benjamin’s even, I guess the rumors were true. but that means also my theory is true.\n\nWhoever was here left in a damn hurry. \n\nBeneath the money I found a key and later found that it went to the adjacent door down the hall. I went in and what I found was alarming to say the least. A skeleton slumped over the table. In one hand he had a bottle of whiskey and in the other a revolver. I took the gun, no bullets but still a nice piece. There was also a note on the floor by his feet. I picked it up and what I read was vague and disturbing.\n\n“I never wanted it to come to this, I thought what we were doing was holy, I was willing to do anything to see our savior reborn into this world! But this blood on our hands, and this thing we summoned. \n\nI can’t”\n\nBlood splatter made the second part of the letter ineligible, and I am starting to get the feeling that the cops never investigated this place. I had to know for sure what happened to my friends and who in the town knew more then they were letting on. \n\nThere was only one more floor to investigate, the basement.\n\nAs I walked down the stairs, I could feel myself descending into madness in real time. Why didn’t the police thoroughly investigate this place? What did they do? Are my friends even dead? As soon as I got to the basement, I got my answer. On the floor was a skeleton of a child, and across the hallway a barred door. When I approached it, I was sent back by a loud BANG! My heart raced as something threw itself against the doors on the other side, the old wooden bar holding the door shut was to old and moldy to hold and began to break.\n\nAs a bit of the door open, I could see a long tongue emerging from the breaches in the door and when I saw it I turned around and ran straight for the exit. By the time I ran up the stairs I heard the doors bust open and ran so fast for the door I thought I was going to take flight. When I busted out of there I ran to my car and looked back. There it was one the other side of the door, unmoving and cloaked in shadows. The only feature I saw was a grin full of razor-sharp teeth that I swore were made of iron. It turned around and I watched its body coil back into the shadows until all the remained was its tail, then nothing.\n\nI was sure of three things; one that thing doesn’t like sunlight. Two, my friends were dead. And three, I can’t trust anyone in my town anymore. I got in my car and drove as far away as I could.",

        "text": "\ni love red raspberries, in my spare time with friends i’m not one to oppose making smoothies at my place, the simplicity of the swirling liquids and the cool savory taste is always a favorite of mine. My friend is a gardener so i can get them hand picked, pretty lucky i know. And i love it don’t get me wrong at all, but something has been seeming so off with her berries lately, i think her gardening skills are getting worse.\n\nLast week i went to pick up berries, i grabbed my purse and a small wood basket to carry the berries in on the way home, one of those baskets that make a weird sound when you squish it like a creaky floor, the inside has red stains from the berries, but it smells like bliss. I showed up at my friends door basket in hand, the weather was a perfect sunny day, it was a 50/50 she’d be home. I knocked on her door regardless.\n“Oh hey Claire, how can i help you” her smile always had given me a warm feeling.\n“Do you happen to have raspberries? i know it’s not the best weather this past week but i’m having my cravings.”\n“Oh, of course give me a minute” she closed the door with a smile, i went and played on my phone thinking nothing of the beating sun.\na loud bang echoed from inside, she usually makes jam so again, no difference.\n“Here you go love!”\n“Thank you god, you’re a saint Ellie i promise, how much for these?”\n“Ellie come here babes” a drunk man inside called to her, another hook up.\n“eh these can be on the house, they aren’t the best but i know you’ll devour them regardless, see you next week” \nshe was quick to close the door but i didn’t mind, she was a busy lady and had to dissect her gardens before the storm came.\n\nI unboxed my berries from the basket, i always hated the little pricks on them at the store, Ellie must have known because i never see any on hers. I watched the berries crunch and slosh around in my blender, creating a lovely red paste as i added more of my fruits to the smoothie. The rest of the day was boring, i won’t leave you all the details but to sum it up, i drank my smoothie, did work and watched tv, mostly a mix of multitasking the last part but hey, your not my boss so you don’t need to worry about that part. Regardless i decided it was about time i head to bed, i shuffled my way around my apartment, finding the bathroom a bit dirty but not bad. I ripped off some floss, i did a lazy job but it’s probably still better than you fucks reading this. As i flossed i felt a weird piece of food between my teeth, like a piece of string, so as anyone would i fished around for it, pulling a weird thin purple and blue ish worm looking thing in my teeth. I won’t lie, i jumped, but i kept inspecting it, the shade changes, it wasn’t a worm. A vein? but come on i’m not jeffery dahmer. I finished brushing my teeth, glancing at the vein on my counter. Once i finished I walked to the kitchen, inspecting any food that may have entered my mouth, goldfish, apples, juice boxes, the raspberries. nothing. until i peaked into the raspberry hole. i plucked the fattest one in the basket, inspecting the deep hole, i plucked around to see if anything was inside. A thin black hair. “god i’m to tired for this shit” I decided on asking Ellie about it tomorrow, when the world is awake.\n\nI woke up quickly, throwing on a hoodie and a skirt and shifted out the door quickly, it was a busy day, easter, i watched women walk briskly down the street, it was like i mentally was racing them. I turned the corner and walked to Ellie’s door quickly.\n“Oh hey Claire how can i help you today love bug”\n“there was a hair and a vein-looking thing in my raspberries” i stepped inside, closing the door. \n“oh i’m so sorry, i have the raspberries set up on the kitchen table if you wanna help me prepare better, it’s a hard single women job and everyone wants fruit salad for easter!”\nI walked to the kitchen, the drunk man from yesterday i assume laid on the counter, knocked out.\n“I’ll do the Raspberries can you help with just cleaning and shaping?”\n“of course Elle”, i pushed passed his feet that draped over the counter. I watched as she pulled out his penis, she used her nail file like Picasso as she cut off the edges of his tip.\n“shit this one’s a bit on” she grumbled as she dug her long nails under the skin, i could hear the skin tears away from itself, fighting back as she pulled harder, deciding to use the nail file, it was like a sad surgeon on his last limbs. After plucking it off she tossed it to me, i carved my way into it and turned it inside out, washing the insides under cool water, what a perfect raspberry. She was so graceful, she loved the men that were shitty because they always tasted the best. The men that called her hot hoe on the streets, how she would take them home and as they slept next to her how she would plot everything so beautifully.\n\nshe proceeded to cut piece by piece of the penis away as i continued shaping and cleaning, they looked scrumptious, i will admit i snuck a few, they were so sweet and fresh, i felt the juices rolling of my chin, i felt how my teeth broke through the skin, it was delicious. I watched her slice the skin as she dug her long nails under the sad chunks, i watched as she pulled out the bones and let me like them like a wooden spoon, it was delicious. i helped her the rest of the day, we had wine and laughed the night away, i looked at the sink, the inside has red stains from the berries, it was beautiful. \n“Thanks for the help Claire seriously needed you!” \n“Of course Elle, i better get going it looks dark out”\n“Alright be safe! bye love”\n\nLike i said, im not jeffery dahmer, but it’s so hard to say no to such sweet luxuries, the berries change my world, my veiws. I’m not dahmer. i don’t do the killing. but you can’t be mad until you try these mouth watering berries.",

        "text": "so my boyfriend and i were driving through the country in our small town and we were bored so we decided to go to an abandoned house that we’ve known about. the house hasn’t been lived in for quite a while. and it’s also very obvious it’s abandoned because you can see into the house and see random doors laying around and broken furniture that has been left behind. it’s a really old brick house and it’s really off putting. when we stepped through the fence we both suddenly felt like our bodies were being pulled down. as if someone put a heavy weight on our heads if that makes sense? the world around me felt so unreal and i felt like i was in a bubble. when we got closer to the house, we heard a literal fire alarm. not a beeping like when batteries are running low. a fire alarm. i don’t know how many of you have experienced fires. but think back to school fire drills, with those ear piercingly loud 3 rings. i think im gonna attach a youtube link as to what im talking about because it is so unique and you can’t really mistake it for anything else. i was so confused and soo nauseas and so dizzy. I tried to attach the video i took of the situation because you can see me almost stumbling because of house lightheaded i was. i really wish nosleep would let me attach it lol. now, there was some kind of silo behind the house and a farm. i don’t know if there was some kind of gas in the air that made us dizzy. my boyfriend suggested that but i don’t really know why a farm would need to release toxic gases into the air. i think he was just trying to make himself feel better because we really couldn’t come up with an explation. regardless, why was there a working fire alarm in this abandoned house? why did it go off and how long was it going on for? why did it feel like a different dimension when we stepped into the property? i literally don’t know. but the rest of that day we both felt sluggish and jittery. i had to go to a class after this, i was pretty shaken up about it and talked to my table about it. they offered every idea that previously came to my mind and everything they came up with was shot back down. i honestly  tried to make myself forget about this because i can’t figure out a logical explanation. from time to time, i think about it, and i wonder, wtf was that? \n\nthis is me e e e e trying to meet t t t t  the five hundred word d d d d d d d minimum requirement t t t t t   that no o o o o o o o o o o  sleep p p p p p p p  is making me do o o",

        "text": "When they explained to me what my job would be I was quite ecstatic. I had never in my life even visited a hotel and now I was chosen as one of the few lucky ones who would help to create a welcoming home for all the visitors that would soon be in our town. \n\nThe T was specifically designed to make you feel as if you were walking around in a dream. Slightly cloudy with soft lights and muffled sounds. Everything was a bit different, for example, the door frames were all of slightly different sizes and colors. The stairs that lead to each floor appeared to never end until you suddenly found yourself at a different number. There was a glass elevator in the middle of the lobby which only very few were allowed to use. \n\nI wasn't one of them.\n\nMost walls were painted in a light lavender shade but others were black. There were phone cords leaving each room that disappeared between walls but all somehow ended up at the reception.\n\nI'm not really sure how that worked but it did look fascinating and odd at the same time. There were 27 phone cords and 27 room keys.  \n\nHowever, my favorite part of the interior was all the different lamps that we got from one special shop out of town. Every single room had its own unique lamp. \n\nI believed I was the luckiest girl in town for getting to work at the shiny new thing we had. Even more, I was thrilled to meet visitors. We didn't get those very often, or to be more correct mostly never. Our town was very secluded.\n\nThough I already had a lingering feeling that I would regret my anticipation soon enough. Being happy in that town is a choice. One that you have to pay for with obedience. That was never one of my strong suits. \n\n\\--\n\n\"You're here for everything and everyone but only after I ask. Or if it ever happens, the owner. But mostly you only listen to me, got it?\"\n\nThose were some of the first words Margery said to me.  \n\nMargery was basically my boss except not really. She ran the whole place, took care of everything, and knew everyone. If you saw her full cherry hair, her athletic body, and her tiny skirts, you'd never believe that she was already 76.\n\n\"The young girl at the reception is Judy. She's 17 or 18. Like you she just finished school. During night shifts we replace her with Jacob. Twins. Kinda *creepy*.\" She whispered the last word. \n\nJudy waved hesitantly and smiled as we walked past her.\n\n\"You can chat later. But not too much.\"\n\nWe kept racing through the hotel as she explained the most basic things: How to make a bed, how to clean a bathroom, how to change a light. \n\n\"I am showing you these things so you can prepare today. When our guests arrive, however, you will not go to their rooms. They must stay quarantined. You will not open one door until I tell you to again.\"\n\nAfter hours of Margery telling me everything I wasn't allowed to do, I still had to prepare two dozen rooms. \n\nAt 8 am I was sent home, exhausted but also sad. The guests were supposed to arrive at night and I would miss it.\n\n\\--\n\nMy second shift started the very next day at precisely 6 am. \n\nThe sun was slowly going down as I walked through the narrow, cobblestone alleys of the town, past all the shops which were getting ready to close for the day. Most shop owners had made posters and signs to invite people inside. They'd been told there would be tourists after all.  \n\nBut nobody had left their rooms and they weren't going to for a while.\n\nThe lobby was empty except for one person. Judy was standing at the reception, her chin resting on her hand as she was doodling something on a piece of paper. \n\nShe looked up and smiled when she saw me. \n\n\"Hey, Emma.\"\n\nI looked at the wall behind her. Yesterday it was full of keys. For some reason, my heart started beating faster.\n\n\"Are all the rooms booked out?\" I asked.\n\nShe nodded. \n\n\"Every single one. And all for at least three weeks. Jacob checked them all in last night apparently which makes my job today pretty dull.\"\n\nI leaned closer to her table and whispered, even though nobody else was around.\n\n\"Did he say something? What were they like?\"\n\nShe shrugged.\n\n\"He said they were all polite and pleasant. A bit different than us but perfectly friendly.\" She said, raising her voice. Then she leaned in closer and whispered, \"but I know he was lying.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\nJudy looked around nervously.\n\n\"I always know when he's lying. He raises his chin and the tone of his voice changes.. But that's not all.\"\n\nShe pulled out a piece of paper underneath the one she was doodling on. \n\nThere were drawings of a bunch of different people. They all looked unique. Some were tall, some were wide, and some dressed in a specific way. But they all had one thing in common. \n\nThey had no faces.\n\nI remembered what Margery had said about the twins. \n\n\"Does he, uhm, draw things like this often?\"\n\n\"Emma!\" \n\nMargery’s loud voice surprised us. She was at the bottom of the staircase but I hadn't even heard her walk down. Judy quickly hid the piece of paper. \n\nThe sound of Margery's heels echoed through the entire lobby as she walked up to us. My body stiffened, and I suddenly felt as if I was in trouble.\n\nMargery looked at her watch.\n\n\"You're five minutes early. You know you don't get paid for that, right?\"\n\n\"I-,'\n\n\"Nevermind,\" she interrupted me. \"I have a task for you. A very important one that I don't trust anyone else with. Follow me.\"\n\n\\--\n\nWe walked into the kitchen where Hugo was cooking something with a tangy but unfamiliar smell.\n\nHugo, who was 30 years younger than Margery but actually looked her real age, was the kitchen chef. He looked the toughest but was probably the nicest guy in the hotel.\n\n\"One of our guests had a very specific wish. Normally, they all receive their meals at the same time but this gentleman is special. When he has a wish we're supposed to fulfill it.\"\n\nMargery spoke in a strict tone.\n\n\"So I'm sending you to his room. You will knock on the door twice and when he tells you to enter, you will. You will place the tray that Hugo prepared on his desk. You will *not* talk to the guest. Can you do that?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Good. The guest lives in room 11.\"\n\nMargery left the kitchen and I waited for Hugo to finish the tray.\n\n\"She's testing you. Wants to see if you can be trusted. You better do exactly what she says or she'll fire you,\" he whispered.\n\nI swallowed. \n\n\"Yeah, I know.\"\n\nWe both knew what that meant. Being fired is taken quite literally around here. \n\n\\--\n\nI took a deep breath before I knocked on the door of room eleven.\n\nAfter my second knock, a deep voice whispered \"Enter.\"\n\nWith the tray on one arm, I opened the door, slowly. \n\nThe sight of the man inside was so strange that I froze on the spot. \n\nHe was sitting by the window, looking at it but not out of it. The blinds were shut and the only light came from the lamp on the nightstand next to his bed.\n\nI couldn't tell you how old the man was but his clothes made me assume that he wasn't young. He was dressed in an uncomfortable-looking checked brown suit and wearing a hat made out of the same fabric. \n\nWithout turning around, he pointed towards the table in the middle of the room. \n\nI tried not to shake too much as I quickly walked over to put down the silver tray. On the table, I saw a small box filled to the brim with keys. \n\nRoom keys? \n\nI didn't want to stay inside the room longer than I needed to. It felt suffocating there.\n\nI was ready to leave again but then the man began to speak. \n\n\"I smell a lot of death in this town.\"\n\nI stayed quiet.\n\n\"They are not educating the people enough. If they keep murdering all the residents, this hotel will have to grow exponentially.\"\n\nSlowly he turned around his head and I saw that he was wearing bandages all around his face. There was a slit cut in where his mouth would be. \n\nI opened my mouth but before I could speak, I felt a hand around my arm, pulling me outside. The door shut and I realized it was Margery. \n\n\"You did well, girl. He seems to like you.\"\n\nMy breath was fast and sharp. \n\nI wanted to ask so many questions but my fear took me over. I've lived here my whole life, fear is the first thing they teach us. We know we can't leave this place and do everything we can to live a decent life. My parents have never asked a critical question and they were the happiest people I know.\n\nMargery walked me down the hall. When we reached the staircase, she smiled and hugged me. It was the first time she seemed human.\n\n\"The man you met wasn't a regular guest. He is the owner of this hotel, we do everything he says.\"\n\nMany people I knew changed after they got their first job. They lost something inside of them, a glimpse of innocence. We do what we're told because we must. What other option is there?  \n\n\"And the other guests?\" I asked, making sure to stay as vague as possible.\n\n\"They are not guests. They are our new neighbors. Well, soon they will be. They are here to acclimate first. Until then they must stay undisturbed.\"\n\nI simply nodded, something I learned to do quite often. Mindlessly I made my way back to the lobby, luckily Margery had no more tasks for the moment. She gave me a moment to calm down. \n\nAt the reception, Judy was replaced by Jacob. Night had come and her shift was over. Jacob didn't greet me, he stayed silent, listening to something that I wouldn't be able to get out of my ears or mind. \n\nThere were sounds coming from the telephone, carried through the cords of the rooms.\n\nThey were crying for help.  \n\nJacob and I looked at each other, hopeless and empty. \n\nBecause we both knew that there was nothing we could do. They had to accept their fates just like everyone else here. \n\nAll I wanted was to get out and leave.\n\nBut unfortunately, in Tattletoe, quitting your job was not an [option](https://www.reddit.com/r/Likeeyedid/).",

        "text": "Thinking... is far easier than other activities. One only needs their own mind, and the rest can be achieved. Problem... the uselessness of it.\n\nDon't let it be an addiction. It haunts you. You go to depths that ruin you. You actively engage in tearing your mind apart. A thread keeps being pulled, but there are two being pulled at once. The mystery, and your sanity. Dissected. Both of them. Together.\n\nYou can reach such a lunacy. Constantly scared. Going back. Trying to make more connections. Often you realize there are no cracks in your logical foundation. They just appear to be so. You could have saved hours, to be with loved ones, to engage in something different, hell to even just enjoy the little things. There are so many. We should.\n\nSometimes I have tried to think what it would be like if I am dead, or more so a specific possible outcome of death. Nothing. When I first began this activity, I didn't know what I would stumble upon. I didn't even know how to go about it. How does one know nothing? Grasp it. Not just to have no sensation, but to feel it.\n\nEach night we go to sleep. We don't know anything. But we don't even know the lack of it. It is just lost. Nothings recorded. We might as well have died, and then reborn. Besides, in all truth our mind is still alive. Slow, but there. We just can't remember.\n\nI was trying to achieve the opposite of sleep. More akin to meditation now I think, but a step further. In meditation you still are. I was seeking not just the destruction of the self, but the complete dissolution of thought. As if my mind was under an fMRI for a split second, and they saw no activity except in a few processes that record memories. The few that sense our internal being. \n\nConsciousness... dissipated. That's what I wanted to feel. To know.\n\nI am flabbergasted right now. Two questions are popping up in my mind. Why I did I do this? Fear of death likely, and a willingness to take it head on. How did I do this? I thought I had no idea.\n\nI remember when I achieved it though. I was in my bed, as often. Even now as I write this, my feet are cozily tucked under my comforter. I do enjoy the little things, but sometimes it isn't enough for me. Sometimes I want more. Maybe this is a mistake, to want more.\n\nI digress though. Obviously often have in writing this up. But I do enjoy to do so. But... it leads to what Cameron said once. We love to take a little flashlight and explore the cavern that is unknown. God forbid that flashlight goes out though.\n\nI remember when I achieved it though. I was in my bed, as often. I had closed my eyes, and tried hard to... I don't even know. A suppression I suppose. It wasn't... it wasn't a step by step process. Sure my eyes were closed, and I didn't hear much. But I felt still. And I most definitely knew me, and knew where I was. I just tried somehow, to stop thinking. To let go. But then... I got creative. I thought about my life in the future. Six Feet Under's ending helped. I thought about me aged and grown up. About to die. About to succumb. Likely in a bed then as well. How I would be. What I may see. In the process-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbsence that was just a second long. Terrified me to my core. I was unsettled. I was nervous. I regretted what I had done. I don't even exactly remember it now. The nightmare may still be in my mind, but I have suppressed it there. I don't need to relieve it. I do know it somewhat though. Nothing.  Truly nothing. No me. No anything. Maybe I still felt the comforter, maybe that's what allowed me to jolt back. But I was only a camera. Simply recording... nothing. \n\nI remember far better what I felt afterwards, when it was fresh in my mind. I felt empty. I felt scared. I was glad that I now knew. I didn't want it again though... except I did as well though.",

        "text": "I have nothing left. I have no money to buy myself out of here. I have no friends who could help. I have no safe space where I could hide. I still have the tablet I am writing on, but no way to recharge it. Once the battery runs out, I won’t even have light. I’ll be trapped down here in the dark, listening to the thing behind the metal door as it tries to force its way out. Claws scraping over metal - howling and shrieking - those will be the last sounds I hear in this world.\n\nI have nothing left, but I still have hope. \n\nI still have hope, and that’s the most terrifying thing of them all.\n\n\\-\n\nI bought hope in early summer from the fortune teller at a local fair. I was in a foul mood that day. I hadn’t wanted to go to the fair in general, nor had I wanted to enter the fortune teller’s tent in particular, but my friends had forced me along, and the old woman running the tent had promised me my money back should I be dissatisfied by her service. \n\nIt was probably this last part that convinced me to give in. She’d jump through all kinds of hoops to put up some show and impress me, and I would demand my money back anyway. Maybe screwing the old carny out of her pay like this would somehow lighten my spirits. It was a cruel and sadistic thought, but that was the state of mind I was in at the time.\n\nShe directed me to sit at the other end of a small table. Cheap glow-in the dark stickers adorned the tablecloth. Her fingers brushed over the tarot cards lying front of her.\n\n“Hmm. Let’s see. Let me see…. Ah… There it is… Your destiny…” She flipped the first card. “The ace of pentacles. Wealth - money - opportunity… The picture is becoming clearer. Yes - You have just graduated business school - top of your class - and you have worked out a foolproof plan to make money. It will make you rich. It will lead you right to the top.” She flipped the next card. \n\n“The tower… Danger - change - disruption. You are at the crossroads of your life - about to embark into the real world. Success and failure are so close together. Ah! I can see it -… you are planning something. Something big… You need money… You are about to meet people - wealthy people - people you need to convince to invest in your plans, and you are worried…”\n\nShe glanced up at me, to gauge my reaction. I just rolled my eyes. She had been absolutely correct with her entire prediction, which would have been very impressive if it wasn’t for the fact that one of my drunken college buddies had been in here right before me. He had probably spent the entire time complaining about my sour mood, inadvertently feeding this old trickster all of this information. Maybe she had hoped to impress me with this little parlor trick. Maybe that was the reason she had promised me my money back. It wasn’t working though. I was far from being impressed\n\nShe swiped the cards from the table with a swift motion. Her face remained neutral.\n\n“You are afraid,” she said, and leaned closer. “You are worried you might not be able to convince these people. You are worried you might fail - something that has never happened to you before. I can help though. You already have everything you need. You are only lacking one thing. One single thing. - Hope!” She twirled her hand, and when her fingers unfolded, a single box of matches was suddenly resting on her palm. “You just need a little push - something to give your confidence a boost. Hope will do that. Hope…”\n\n“Right,” I said, drawing out the world. I rolled my eyes again. The woman motioned for me to take the matchbox. It felt light. I slid it open. Empty. - “Wow,” I said. “How impressive.”  \n\n“There’s nothing in it yet,” she said. “We need to fill it with hope. Just keep looking into the box. Now picture the meeting with your investors. Imagine yourself successful and convincing. Really paint a mental picture of the scene.”\n\n“Uh huh,” I said, taking a huge annoyed breath.\n\n“No. Really picture it in your head. Describe the scene. Tell me exactly what you see. What kind of clothes are the people you’re talking to wearing? What kinds of expressions are they making? What are they saying? What does the room smell like?  …”\n\nIt went on like this for at least twenty minutes. I’d imagine the scene, and the fortune teller made me describe every little detail. We went through this whole exercise dozens of times.\n\nFinally she stopped. Her gaze focused on the matchbox. Her hand darted forward. She snatched it from me, quickly enclosing it in her fist, while whispering some sort of chant. She held it close to her mouth for a moment, while her whispers took on more and more of a steady rhythm. After half a minute she unfolded her fingers once more. The matchbox was resting on her palm. It appeared unchanged.\n\n“There. Now it is full. Full of hope. Take a look, but don’t open it all the way. Just a crack. We don’t want all the hope to just slip out again, right?”\n\n“No. Of course not. That would be such a terrible tragedy.” I took the matchbox. It felt just as light as it had the first time. I opened it. Empty.\n\n“Oh Wow! Would you look at that... - Nothing! Very impressive. So… are we finally done with-”\n\nI stopped mid-sentence. Something was happening. The matchbox was empty and ordinary and utterly unremarkable, but the longer I stared into it, the more I could feel a scene forming before my inner eyes. It was the very same scene the old woman had made me picture over and over again. I had done it so often, that merely looking into the box made me imagine it automatically.\n\n“Huh…” I said to myself. I closed the matchbox, then opened it again. The same thing happened. Close. Open. Close. Open. It happened every time. I scratched my head. “Oh! I get it. It’s like some sort of hypnotic trigger. Okay. Gotta admit: That’s a nice little trick.”\n\n“You can call it whatever you like,“ she said. “A trick, an illusion, real magic… But it’s hope. Something we all need. Too much of anything is a bad thing of course, even too much hope. You need to keep them realistic and grounded. If you let them get to big, this -” and here she gestured at the matchbox. “- will really start messing with your head. You can keep it for free, if you are satisfied with my services. Or would you rather have your money back?”\n\n\\-\n\nEven if it had been nothing but a little mental trick, the old fortune teller turned out to be right about one thing: I had only needed a little boost in confidence, and the matchbox provided me with just that. One look inside, and I would relive the scene of my success, standing between the smiling faces of my new business partners, shaking their hands as they competed to be the first to sign with me.\n\nThe actual meeting didn’t end up going as smooth and effortless as that dreamlike vision of course. Quite a few of my potential backers had some worries about the soundness of my plans, but just when it felt like they might back out I pulled out the matchbox beneath the table, and peeked inside. Instantly a renewed mental strength bloomed within my mind. I knew what I had to do to convince them. I sketched out a bright future. I painted a lavish fantasy of wealth. I promised them even higher returns. There was not a trace of doubt in my words, and this show of resolve was the last push needed to get them on my side. \n\nWhen the meeting ended I had secured half a million dollars in seed money. Enough to get me started.\n\nWhy stop there though? The more I could get, the higher the winnings. I scheduled another meeting, using my dad’s business contacts to invite other potential backers. The first hurdle had already been cleared. It would be easy to convince even more people now. I just had to slightly over-exaggerate the profit margin, while downplaying the risks. I wasn’t even stepping too far from the truth. My initial projection had been rather conservative after all. I probably had a very good chance to exceed the most lofty goals.\n\nWas there some risk of failure? Of course. There always is. Nobody gets ahead by playing things entirely safe. You have to take a little gamble here and there, and that’s just what I did. I took a little gamble.\n\n\\-\n\nIt went on like this for two months. New money flowed in every day. My venture grew. So did my funds. I had cracked seven figures by now, and was expanding at a rapid pace. Everything was perfect. Everything except for the little fact that my measly earnings lagged behind my promises. I was making money, sure, but it was far less than what my investors were expecting. Would they start withdrawing their funds? Once that started happening my profits would shrink even more, which would trigger the next batch of backers to jump off. The entire business was in danger of failing in its infancy.\n\nMy sour mood was back. I kept relying more and more heavily on the matchbox to keep going, but it got harder and harder to do so. Every evening I would sit on my desk and crunch the numbers, and when they didn’t come up right once again, I’d take out the box and peek inside until my dark thoughts dispersed. \n\nThe box felt heavier now. Its cardboard walls were bulging outward, as if something inside was slowly gaining size. It was as empty as ever of course. There was nothing in there - nothing except those luring fantasies. The visions were just as strong as in the beginning, but they just weren't enough to lift my spirit. I had more pressing problems now. I had bigger concerns. I needed something more. I needed something stronger. I needed more hope to get me through this. \n\nMore hope… \n\nMore hope than could fit into a little matchbox…\n\nAnd so - on one fateful evening - I took a metal tin of cookies, dumped its content onto the desk, then threw the opened matchbox inside before quickly slamming the lid shut. There! Now my hope would have more room to grow.\n\nIt was a purely symbolic act of course. There wasn’t actually anything in that matchbox. It was all just a little mental trick. That’s what I told myself at least. On some level I must have already believed that the box box wasn’t empty at all - that there was something in there - something that was getting bigger - something alive…\n\nI peeked into the cookie tin the very next morning. Empty - just as expected. The matchbox was lying on its side in the far corner. It had somehow slid open completely. Before I could wonder how that might have happened, a shadow slithered within the darkness. For a split second the box stopped being empty. Something long and twitching writhed within the narrow confines of the tin. \n\nA thousand little legs trashed along a worm-like body, twisted around on itself with seemingly no beginning or end - a sickening mix of a centipede and a möbius strip. A deep feeling of disgust and wrongness washed over me. Then the terrible shadow disappeared, and I was struck by another dreamlike vision, stronger than any I had experienced before.\n\nThe market was turning. The economic drought ended. Red numbers turned green. Arrows went upward. Each and every single one of my stale financial assets suddenly unleashed its true potential. A torrent of money flooded my bank account. I saw myself sitting amidst my investors at a grand feast celebrating my success. I raised a glass into the air, as they all cheered and clapped, and then they started chanting my name - again, and again, and louder and louder... \n\nIt was about to happen. Of course it was about to happen. It all seemed so obvious all of the sudden. Success and happiness and wealth and money and respect and admiration - it was all there. All my worry was blown away. Of course… How could I have not seen it before? The market always fluctuates. There’s ups and downs. Currently we were stuck in a little downward slide, and even then my genius investment strategy was making money. That meant I’d be making even more once the market turned in my favor. I could see it happening. I would make more than I had ever dared to dream of.\n\nThe terrible sight of the squirming creature had completely vanished from my conscious mind. There was nothing left of the horror I had felt. There was only a glorious elation. This beautiful vision was about to come true. It would happen any day now. The vision made me feel absolutely certain. I just needed to make sure my current investors wouldn’t jump ship before it all came to pass. I just needed to pretend that the earnings were already this high.\n\nI could trick them. It would be easy. I still had a constant influx of fresh cash from new clients. I could take some of their money, cook the books a little, then present it as profit instead of actually investing it. Not exactly legal, of course, but that didn’t matter. Once the market turned, I could easily patch up any discrepancies. Nobody would even notice. Everybody would be happy in the end.\n\nIt was a lot more risky than anything I had done before. If my plan failed, I wouldn’t just go bankrupt, I would face serious criminal charges. This was all part of the game though. That’s what you need to do to make it big. If things get though, you bend the rules. You gamble big. That’s how all those millionaires got to where they are now.\n\nI looked into the cookie tin once more. I took in the vision, and then I took a gamble.\n\n\\-\n\nThings shifted for the better, things shifted for the worse, and when things went really bad, I diverted even more money to hide my losses. I took credits from the bank. I convinced my father to invest most of the family fortune into my business. It would all work out in the end. I was certain. The market would turn in my favor. Any day now. It was about to happen any day…\n\nHope continued to grow. By now there was no denying that it was more than some illusion. Hope was real. The fortune teller had actually caught something, and trapped it for me, and now it was quickly gaining size. The cookie tin was heavy, as if filled with stones. The metal walls were dented in dozens of places. More dents appeared every day. I had to wrap duct tape around the lid, to keep it from being pushed open. The current container was reaching its limits.\n\nMy business was reaching its limits as well. I had strayed further and further along the trajectory of fraud and embezzlement, fueled by the hope that some sudden change in the market would turn the tides, and clean the whole mess up. That was becoming increasingly unlikely. \n\nBarely any money was actually invested into anything any more. I needed all of it to keep my little web of deception from falling apart, constantly shifting it back and forth to patch up holes, only to tear even bigger ones in the process. If I had more, I could make some more daring investments - high risk, high return - but there wasn’t even enough for this kind of desperate measure. It wasn’t enough. I needed more. More. More. More money. More hope.\n\nI bought a large travel suitcase, and wrapped it in iron chains. This would be Hope’s new home. Maybe if it was able to grow larger, the visions would grow strong enough to clear my head of all the worries. That’s really all I needed. A clear head to think things through. Just a day without all this mental stress. If I could have that, I could find a way out.\n\nThe moment I trapped the cookie tin within the suitcase it began shaking and trembling. The sound of cracking and crunching and screeching accompanied each tremble. I paced through the room, flinching and trembling whenever another explosion of noise came from within the suitcase. Fear rose in those moments. My neck was damp from cold sweat. My arms shivered uncontrollably. My fingernails dug into the palms of my hands. \n\nI couldn’t tell where those feelings of fear and panic came from. Something inside my stomach urged me to flee. I did not. I could not. Soon I couldn’t move at all anymore. I could only squeeze myself into the furthest corner of the room, completely frozen, while the suitcase rocked back and forth. Hours went by.\n\nEven after the commotion stopped I didn’t dare to move for a while. I took a few minutes for my terror to seep away. My heart rate slowed. My breathing found a calm rhythm. My muscles relaxed. By now all my fear felt like some silly overreaction. Nothing had happened. Why had I been so afraid? Nothing had happened, and nothing would happen. I took a step towards the suitcase. No reaction. I reached out, touched it with the tips of my fingers. Nothing. I took hold of the large metal clasps keeping it closed. Nothing. I opened it… \n\nInstantly the lids were flung apart. Only the chains kept them from opening completely. The iron links grew taut from the internal pressure. An angry scream roared out at me. A trashing mass of intertwined limbs flung itself against the opening. There was that thing again - that horrible shadow that I had seen all those weeks ago. It wasn’t just larger now. It was more concrete, more real. This wasn’t just a fleeting shadow, gone in a flash. \n\nThe creature looked like a twisted centipede, but instead of insectile legs it had human arms - all of them contorted and wrong, each in its own way. Joints bent the wrong way. There were too many fingers, or too few. Some had skin so pale and thin you could see the raw mass of meat underneath, blue veins running across it like a spiderweb. Pustules and bulbous growths stained the flesh everywhere. Fingernails were missing, or extended into needle-like claws… \n\nThe hands hammered against the walls of their tiny prison. An intense screeching scream cut into my eardrums like a knife. And then…\n\nSilence.\n\nThe thing was gone. \n\nAll that was left was an empty suitcase.\n\nI had flung myself backwards, and was now clinging to the side of my desk. My heart was beating like crazy. I didn’t know what had happened, but my inner voice was screaming at me to run. There was something else though. The suitcase stood open, empty and harmless. A sweet gentle light seemed to shimmer within. It might have been nothing but a stray ray of sunlight, reflected back by the metal clasps, but it was beckoning me to step closer. \n\nI let out a laugh. It came out with a tremble at first, but then I took another breath, and laughed again, this time deep and genuine. There was no way I could have seen any of this. There was no way I could have seen all of those horrifying details. How could I have possibly made out all those details in the darkness of the suitcase - through that tiny crack, and all the way from across the room? My mind had made it up. That was it. My mind had made it all up.\n\nI had seen the suitcase shake violently. I had seen some sort of shadow move inside. That was it though Everything else had been a product of my stressed out imagination. There was nothing dangerous in there, and even if there was, it was clearly unable to get out. I shook my head. How absurd of me to get this startled over a little shadow.\n\nThe misty light flashed once more from past the crack. I moved closer, and leaned towards the opening.\n\nEmpty.\n\nThe suitcase was empty. Of course it was empty. I let out another laugh. The only thing in there were the twisted remnants of the cookie tin - now barely recognizable - just a chunk of metal seemingly crushed and ripped apart - its surface gleaming in the darkness - and… \n\n\\-\n\n*I was sitting in the backseat of a luxurious car. My body swayed slightly as the driver wove through the dense traffic. My right hand was resting on the cool dark leather seat to steady myself.* \n\n*“We’ll be there in another ten minutes, sir,” the driver said.* \n\n*“Huh?” I answered, and looked up from the issue of Fortune magazine I held in my left hand. It was hard to focus on anything else right now. A glossy photo of myself smiled back from the front cover. The main article lauded me as the next big thing, telling the rousing story of how I overcame certain bankruptcy through pure tenacity, and inborn skill. I had faced down hardship, and came out as a multi-millionaire.* \n\n*‘I never doubted in my success for a single second,’’ I was quoted by the interviewer. ‘This has always been my destiny.’*\n\n\\-\n\nThe scene faded slowly. I was back in my study, lying flat on the carpet, staring up at the ceiling with a dazed expression. Drool stained the corner of my mouth. There was a huge smile plastered on my face, and a lightness in my mind I hadn’t felt in weeks. Any thoughts about the terrible thing inside the suitcase were gone. Everything felt like it would be alright in the end. Things were looking grim now, but that just meant I needed to make some risky plays, and trust that my abilities would get me through. I had always been the best of the best back in college. I could do it. \n\nAll the visionary leaders who had risen to glory from nothing had faced moments of struggle and uncertainty. Those were the moments that separated the chosen ones from the rest. I could back down, accept my punishment like a cowardly criminal, or I could double-down, and dare for something greater. The vision was still playing in front of my eyes. I knew what I had to choose. I was destined for greatness. Eventually I would succeed.\n\nI just needed some fresh cash. I already had taken several credits from the major banks. Taking any more of them might lead to some awkward questions. Somebody might decide to take a closer look at my books. I couldn’t allow that to happen. Luckily there were a lot of other places you could turn to for credit - places that were a lot less reputable, and a lot more ruthless when it came to collecting.\n\nI didn’t care about any of that. I could accept their crushing interest rates. I only needed the money to kick-start my business back to life. One or two weeks down the line, and I would have made enough to pay them back with ease. It was a gamble for sure, but I had already taken some major gambles. \n\nWhat did I really have to lose? \n\nJust another gamble…\n\n–\n\nI fell short in my first attempt to get out of the hole I had dug for myself into. The money I had borrowed was gone in an instant. It didn’t matter. There were other loan sharks out there. I could just try again, and again, and again… \n\nIt was easy to ignore the angry letters. \n\nIt was easy to ignore the phone calls, and the death treats and the screaming creditors trying to chase me down. \n\nIt was easy to ignore everything, until I woke up one morning to the stench of gasoline and fire. Thick smoke drifted through my bedroom window. A burning wreck of metal stood in my driveway. Somebody had climbed the fence to my home, and set fire to my brand new Mercedes.\n\nAs I watched the firemen douse the flickering flames, I felt reality slowly catch up with me. I was deeper in debt than ever, and the people I owed money to would not be content with merely suing me. These were the kind of people who didn’t bother with lawyers. These were the kind of people who would break my kneecaps, harvest my organs, then toss me from a bridge with a pair of cement shoes.\n\nI ran up to my office, pulled out every ledger, scattered documents all over the floor, searching for any asset I could turn into cash. Five million. If I let go of everything I could still scrape together five million. That would have been a staggering sum of money a few months ago. By now it wasn’t even enough to pay back my worst debts.\n\nWhat options did I even have anymore? I could take the money, get a fake passport, flee the country, try to rebuild my life somewhere far away. What kind of life would that be though? A life of constant fear. A life on the run from both the police and the mob. A life without prospects. A life in which I’d be forever barred from living up to my potential. How long until those five million would run out? What would I do then?\n\nI suddenly found myself down in the cellar standing in front of the entrance to the old boiler room. My subconsciousness had led me down here all on its own. A thick iron door was blocking my path. I had just installed it. The suitcase had grown too small for Hope. This was where it lived now.\n\nIt moved behind the walls as if reacting to my presence. My hair stood on edge. My steps wavered back and forth, unable to decide in what direction to move. I had been coming down here a lot, just pacing in tight circles, glancing towards the door, but I had never actually dared to look through the spy hole into the room beyond. Every single one of my senses screamed danger when I stepped close, and yet I could not keep myself from returning.\n\nI was frozen by indecision. The voice of reason in my head told me to head back upstairs, but then what? Should I spend the evening staring at the smoldering wreckage of my car? Should I spend another hour rifling through stacks of unpaid bills? I couldn’t do that. I couldn’t go on like this. I needed something to steady myself. I needed hope…\n\nI had already taken a step forward. Something shifted behind the door - the whisper of a thousand fingers sliding across the walls inside. I took a deep breath, like one would take before diving into a deep ocean, and squeezed my eye against the spy hole, and...\n\n\\-\n\nI nearly spilled my glass of wine. The red liquid sloshed back and forth, and I struggled to keep it contained. What had just happened? What was going on? My head snapped back and forth.\n\nI was sitting on a sofa in a stylish apartment. The entire left side of the room was one large window, allowing a staggering view down at the rest of the city. It looked so small and insignificant from up here, but this was one of New York’s tallest skyscrapers after all. Soft lounge music played from invisible speakers. A group of people was smoking cigars somewhere behind me, and the bitter fragrance hung faintly in the air.\n\n“Is everything alright?” Somebody asked. A group of people was surrounding me. Young men and women, young, and beautiful, and perfectly styled. They were all smiling, and looking at me with deep fascination.\n\n“Yes. Sorry,” I answered. “Just got caught up in a memory. Where was I?”\n\n“You were just telling us about the day the mob came after you.”\n\n“Right. Right. That day. That was the closest I had ever gotten to complete ruin. And it was only two years ago. Two years. Can you believe it? From the absolute bottom to one of the richest people on the globe - in just two years…”\n\n“But how did you do it?” They leaned closer, their eyes wide, and sparkling with excitement. Some were holding their breath. I just smiled and raised the glass to my lips. My companions begged me to continue, but I let them hang for a few seconds longer, sampling both the sweet wine, and their adoring stares. \n\nIf only I could reach back and time and tell my younger self that everything was about to work out perfectly fine. I had been so damned scared back then. I closed my eyes and tried to order the memories of that day. My car had burned, and then I had gone to look at Hope, and I had listened to its visions, and then…\n\n\\-\n\nMy eyes opened. The brightness of the fancy apartment was gone. The air was chilly and dark and damp. I could still feel the taste of wine on my tongue, could still make out the faint scent of cologne and cigars in my nostrils. Where was I? What had happened? Had I gotten too drunk at the party? Or had I… Was this… What year was it again?\n\nMy thoughts moved painfully slow, as they tried to separate reality from the dreamlike vision. Just a dream. I had been nothing but a dream, and yet my panic was gone. It had been so much more than a mere fantasy. It had felt like an omen, a sign from the gods themselves. Everything would be okay. I was once more filled with the unwavering determination that had gotten me this far. Everything would be okay. I knew exactly what to do. I could have all the money I needed - all in a single day. \n\nAll it would take was one more gamble.\n\nOne more gamble…\n\n\\-\n\nTwo hours later I stepped out of the rented limo, clutching a briefcase tightly to my chest. It contained what remained of my money  - the entire five million. I swallowed, gathered my strength, and entered the casino with my head held high, and a confident smile on my face.\n\nI headed straight to the roulette table. No need to delay the inevitable. This was it. All on red. Everything on this one lucky toss. The wheel spun. The little ball danced across the surface, clicking and rolling. I could focus on nothing else. This ball was my entire world right now. All my senses were completely focused on its erratic motions. Up and down and jumping back and forth from one color to the other - red - black - red - black… The wheel was slowing down. The moment of truth came closer and closer. Red - black - red - black… RED!\n\nI doubled forward. Red. Red. RED! I had won. This would be enough. It wouldn’t be enough to pay back everyone, but enough to get the loan sharks off my back. I wouldn’t get stabbed to death by a bunch of mobsters after all… but I would still go to prison… My whole fraudulent venture would collapse, and they’d drag me to court, and I’d be convicted…\n\nMy life was still effectively over. Sure - I’d be living and breathing and walking around, but that bright future I had dared to imagine would never come to pass. I needed something better. I needed more. Maybe I could… If I bet it all again…All on red… If I managed to win one more time… What did I really have to lose? I had to do it. Another gamble. I had to. \n\nAnother gamble.\n\nAll on red.\n\nThe wheel spun. The ball danced. I was clutching the rim of the table. It was the only way I could remain standing upright. Everything was spinning. Dark dots seemed to dance in front of my eyes. I couldn’t breathe. I could barely even see what was going on. My entire world was reduced to two colors. Red - black - red - black -... RED! RED!!! RED!!!!!\n\nI was screaming in triumph, jumping up and down, my hands held up into the air, unable to contain the powerful rush of dopamine flooding my brain. I had won. This was enough. I’d be able to take care of my bad credits, and then there would still be enough to give my investors their money back - not as much as I had promised them, but they’d all at least break even. It would be enough to keep people from looking too closely at what had been going on. It would be enough to keep them from suing me.\n\nI’d still be personally bankrupt of course. I had lost most of the family fortune during this whole scheme after all. I still had an excellent degree though. I could easily get a well-paying job. It wasn’t what I had dreamed of, but it was something. \n\nI had wanted to make it all on my own. I had wanted to prove myself. Back in college I had always been so much better than those other idiots. Now they would sneer at me crawling back to beg for their table scraps. So shameful. So humiliating. This wasn’t how it was supposed to happen. I was so much better than all of them. I deserved so much better.\n\nAnd yet this was how it had to happen. I had no other option. Unless… \n\nI licked my lips. The dopamine was still lingering in my mind, causing a warm prickling feeling to spread through my entire body. My eyes darted down at the roulette table. If I got lucky just one more time, I could have everything I ever wanted and more. I would prove to them all how great I was.\n\nHope’s vision still danced fresh in my mind. I could still hear the laughter of the fancy party, could still feel the attentive eyes resting on me, could still taste the wine on my tongue. I just needed to get lucky one more time. It had been more than just a dream. It had been a message from the future. Just once more. One more gamble… \n\nOne more gamble… \n\nOne more gamble…\n\n\\-\n\nWhen the men broke down the door to my apartment, I was already hiding in the cellar. I could hear them stomp through the rooms above. Glass shattered. Wood broke. They were wrecking everything, searching for any hints to my current whereabouts. The brutal noises were a frightening reminder of what they would do once they found me. There was an even more terrifying sound though. Hope was shifting behind the metal door.\n\nIt seemed to have grown rapidly over the course of a single night. Its massive form slammed against the barrier between us. Caws and teeth dug into the metal. Something hissed sharply, and then it started screaming. \n\nThose screams… \n\nThose screams were the worst part of it all. They sounded like a thousand voices twined together, shouting out in agony and death. Not just any voices. Each of them was my voice. Each of them belonged to another version of me, endlessly tortured.\n\nI curled into a shivering ball, mouth dry, sobbing. My muscles clenched up from the fear until I could barely even take a breath, and Hope kept screaming and screaming. I almost felt like I could see it through the walls - a shapeless mass of distorted humanoid arms, woven together into one singular monstrous being - pulsing like a heart - rippling like waves on a murderous ocean - all of them reaching out to pull me into their center, to swallow me up until I was gone from this world.\n\nThe walls shook from its attempts to break free. Any moment now the men upstairs would hear the sounds, and they would follow them down here to my hiding place. It was only a matter of seconds. \n\nThey didn’t come. They didn’t even seem to notice. None of the flimsy shelves surrounding me seemed to react either. They weren’t rattling, or wobbling, or collapsing. They stood perfectly still, as if my mind was the only thing in this entire universe that could feel the massive quake.\n\nAt some point the sounds died down. Hope stopped its struggles, and the men above stopped trashing my apartment. A sudden pull in my chest made me rise. Something was calling me. Something from beyond the iron door. It was pure madness to approach it after what I had just experienced, yet I took a step forward. For nearly a year I had responded to every threat - every danger, every challenge - in the exact same way, by turning to Hope. It was the same now. I was more scared than I had ever been - scared of Hope itself - but this very fear made me crave another vision so bad.\n\n‘Why not take a look?’ Some part of me whispered in my mind. ‘Maybe what you see will help you, and you’re just as safe or unsafe in front of the door, as you are three feet away. Why not get closer, and have a look?’\n\nI could already feel my limbs give in to the suggestion. I was unable to stand, so I began crawling - closer and closer. Just one look. One little look. Maybe it would help… - I was already halfway there, when I managed to stop myself.\n\n“No,” I said, half to myself, half to the thing behind the door. “N-no… You lied to me. No. You lied. You…” - My words were little more than the ramblings of a scared little kid. That was the state I had been reduced to.\n\nAs if able to sense my resistance, Hope raised the cacophonous chorus of its voices, and slammed against the walls. I curled back into the dirt. It didn’t matter how tightly I squeezed my hands against my ears. Nothing could blot out the sound. A thousand versions of my own voice screaming in agony…\n\nThere wasn’t enough strength in me to resist anymore. I needed help. I needed something to ward off the terrors in my mind, and the only thing that could do that was Hope itself. I needed a vision, just a little one, just one to grant me enough strength to move again. The moment Hope stopped I began crawling forward again. Before I was even aware of what I was doing. I was kneeling in front of the metal door - like an acolyte cowering before the altar of an angry God. I squeezed my eye against the spy hole.\n\nThere was nothing to be afraid of. There never had been. Those screams, they hadn’t been my screams. They were the screams of my enemies. I could see them scramble in panic, running, and cowering, and trying to hide. Hope was walking amongst them, constantly shifting its form.  One moment it was a majestic eagle with ebony talons, the next it was a black dog with gleaming rubies for eyes, then it was a hairless giant with skin of gold - and it took anybody who had ever dared to oppose me, and it sliced them open, and it ripped them apart, and it crushed them to a pulp of meat and bones, and I was standing next to the scene on a pile of their corpses - untouchable - victorious  - god-like…\n\nI was vaguely aware of my hand reaching for the door knob. I could already feel its smooth cold shape against my fingertips. At the last second I pulled away, shocked by what I had nearly done. Once more Hope sensed my hesitation. Once more it started screaming, and I flung myself as far away as the tiny room allowed, and it kept screaming and screaming and hammering and clawing and screaming, and then it fell silent all of the sudden, and through the silence that whispering desire rose once more.\n\n‘Come closer to the door,’ it said. ‘Just one look. Just one more look. Just to be certain about what you have seen. Just one more look. How could this hurt…?’\n\n\\-\n\nIt has happened again and again over those last few hours. There are those bursts of rage and violence, followed by a luring sweet silence. Even as I am composing what might be my last message to the world, it keeps going on and on. Sometimes I manage to resist. Other times my mind caves in, and I crawl closer, and I am always rewarded with the same dream.\n\n‘It doesn’t need to be a dream,’ the voice inside me whispers. ‘It could be reality. It would be so easy. All you need to do is to open the door. Just open the door, and let Hope out, so it may walk by your side, and protect you, and serve you… It could all be so easy…’\n\nI have nothing left. I have no money to buy myself out of here. I have no friends who could help. I have no safe space where I could hide. \n\nI have nothing left. \n\nBut I still have hope. \n\nI still have hope, and I have the key to its prison.\n\n…\n\nOne last gamble…",

        "text": "  \n\nI’m a medium for patients in a persistent vegetative state. When a patient doesn’t have a living will, a family may bring me in to illicit a psychic response as to what the family should do i.e., pull the plug or not. I visit hospitals, hospices, and residential homes. I’d rather go to a patient’s house, because there is complete buy-in to what I am trying to accomplish. The hospital staff hates and resents me. They believe I’m a fake, a charlatan, an opportunistic snake-oil salesman, and of course, they are one hundred percent correct. I’m a fraud, but I provide a valuable service. I never make a decision that’s not in line with what the family wants. In fact, they almost always want me to tell them that their loved one is ready to move on, to get to the other side and cross the bright barrier of light into heaven. The family is truly making the decision, but they don’t want the associated guilt. I take that away from them and assure them that this is the right thing to do. No family ever calls me without already knowing what they have decided. I charge them three hundred dollars for each visit. \n\nI didn’t start out trying to defraud people. I became a psychic to find that whisper that I lost so long ago. When I was seven years old my sister was diagnosed with leukemia. She put up a valiant fight, always forcing a smile, which, even as young as I was, I could tell it was contrived for my sake. She never wanted me to see her suffer, not for her own peace of mind, but to assure me that everything was alright. She died, not even graduating from high school, not quite an adult, but at the young age of seventeen. She died on March 14th. \n\nThe next year, on the anniversary of her death, late at night, while lying in bed, I had a vision of a large white snake moving through the high grass. I heard a whisper. *I love you Booby.* She always called me Booby instead of Bobby. Life was fun for her. She was always laughing and playing jokes. She was popular and well liked. How we were siblings I don’t know. She was light, and I was darkness. I was a gloomy loner, never making any friends. I heard that whisper on March 14th for fifteen years, and then, it just stopped. I assumed it was drowned out by the worries of becoming an adult with responsibilities well beyond what my immature mind could handle.  \n\nI visited a psychic and told her my story. She convinced me that I had the gift but had lost it because I didn’t continue to immerse my mind in the Akashic stream of consciousness. She was always talking in parables and metaphors. She took me in as a journeyman, teaching me the craft, which consisted of reading people and telling them what they wanted to hear. Surprisingly, she made a lot of money doing it. She lived where she worked. When she died, she left it all to me. \n\nI didn’t come up with the idea of being a psychic power of attorney for the brain dead on my own. A woman made an appointment, and asked if I could come to St. Mark’s hospital, room 223. I agreed. I walked into the room to find it full of people. They were relatives, and the man lying in the hospitable bed was unconscious, unaware of their presence. He was a man in his forties, in a vegetative state, the result of numerous debilitating strokes. She wanted to know if Dave- that was his name- was ready to die. \n\nThat was a first for me, but why not? I could tell they were worn out and ready to be done with it, so I sat down and grabbed Dave’s lifeless hand, closed my eyes, and started to act like I was conversing with the man. I would ask questions audibly and respond as if he was talking back. I told them that he was conscious of everything that was going on around him. He felt like a prisoner, and it was driving him insane. He assured me that he was suffering immensely and ready to go home to heaven. He said that an angel had appeared to him and told him that there was a mansion in heaven prepared for his arrival. \n\nAfter the session was done, the family looked relieved. The woman wrote me a check for five hundred dollars, and it didn’t bounce. At that point, I knew there was an available business niche that I could fill. I would have the market all to myself. I started advertising online and putting up flyers near hospitals. It’s not a steady stream of revenue but it pays well, because at that point the family is desperate, and willing to pay more than the normal amount, especially if I prolong the process, stretching it out across several sessions. \n\nOn one unlucky occasion, late at night, I was called to come to a trailer home. It was on a narrow country road on top of a flat hill, surrounded by trees. Culbertson Road runs along Mill Creek. There were no streetlights. There had been several instances of cars taking one of the curves too quick and running off into the creek. I made sure to keep it nice and slow. My destination was about half-way between the beginning and the end of the road, the only residence, with a lone tilted mailbox. There was a gate across the drive, kept shut with a chain and padlock. Waiting for me on the opposite side of the street was a station wagon, sitting idly in the dark. \n\nThe headlights turned on, blinding me as I came to a stop. A woman of a diminutive stature, dressed in a business casual suit, got out of the car and walked over to my window. I rolled down my window. \n\n“Robert Jones?” she asked in a childlike voice. \n\n“Yes mam.”\n\n“Hello, I’m Beverly. We spoke on the phone. Let me open the gate and then you follow me.”\n\nShe pulled a set of keys out of her coat pocket and unlocked the padlock, unwrapped the chain, and then swung the gate back towards the property. She got in her car and pulled through the gate. I rolled in behind her and we slowly made our way up the hill. As we got closer, I could see the single wide trailer nestled among some barren trees. It was old and dirty, with faux rock skirting, and blue siding, a clash of colors meant to convey earth and sky. We parked the cars in the gravel driveway, mine behind hers. She got out her car and came to the back hatch. She opened the hatch and pulled out a flashlight and a lantern. I walked up to her, confused. The place looked abandoned. \n\n“There’s no power. Forgive me. Mr. Davis didn’t have a lot of money. This property has been in his family for a long time.” She lit the lantern and handed me the flashlight. I tried to turn it on, but it didn’t work. I didn’t want to make a fuss, so I just kept my mouth shut. The name- Davis- sounded familiar to me, but I couldn’t completely recall where I had heard it. \n\nWe walked in and the first thing I noticed was that the interior was stripped bare and painted black, including the ceiling. There were no doors nor appliances. Walls had been removed so that it was one large empty space. The only thing in the room was a bed and next to it a chair and a nightstand. On the nightstand were jars filled with some liquid that I couldn’t as of yet identify.  At the foot of the bed on each side of the footboard were candle stands, holding lit black candles. \n\n“What the hell is this?” I said as I turned to face Beverly. She had pulled out a gun and it was pointed at my face. \n\n“You have the gift or not? I hope you’re not a fake. Do as I say, and you can leave in one piece. Now sit in that chair, grab his hand, and do your thing.”\n\nI plumped down in the seat, lost in thought. This is karma. I’m getting what I deserve. I grabbed his hand. It was cold and stiff, this son of a bitch was dead, beset by rigor mortis. I turned to look at Beverly. She nodded her head as if to say don’t even worry about it. I was dead. I just knew it. Was she expecting me to bring this guy back to life? I do readings, not resurrections. All of the sudden his hand grew warm. I went to pull my hand away, but he grabbed it and wouldn’t let go. It was like my hand was caught in a vice grip. He had superhuman strength and no matter how hard I pulled and tugged; I could not get free. I don’t know why I didn’t notice before but because of his moaning I looked up at his face. The crown of his skull was missing and where his eyes should have been there were empty sockets. His lips were withered down to two thin lines and his nose was all but corroded away. \n\n“You do have the gift,” Beverly said, rapt in awe. “Meet Clayton Davis, the most powerful clairvoyant of all…. A god.”\n\nNow I recalled that name. It was a story told around campfires. An urban legend about the real foundations of the community of Antioch, not founded by morally scrupulous Christians, but by a cult following a Mr. Davis said to have the power to make people do unspeakable things to themselves. He was worshipped out of fear but at some point, he was defeated and destroyed. The story is vague at that point. Who or what destroyed him? \n\nSurely, this wasn’t the same Clayton Davis. I was getting a different vibe. This man was a pawn. His powers used at another’s bidding. I had a vision of him embraced by a white serpent, with a pale grey creature whispering in his ear. Clayton was a tool. I saw that he had been alive a prisoner for over 250 years. Only recently, had he freed his mind long enough to shove a pistol into his mouth and pull the trigger. Something needed Clayton Davis. Something needed his power, but Clayton didn’t want it. He wanted to move on. I could feel his desperation. He was pleading with me to stop this regeneration. \n\nI felt a sharp cut across my lower forearm, the blade of a knife sliding deep and fast. Beverly held a mason jar under the cut and collected the blood. She went over to Clayton and forced the blood into his mouth, making him swallow against his will. The flesh of his body took on a livelier hue. Beverly walked back over to collect more blood, and I kicked her as hard as I could in her knee. I grabbed the knife by the blade, the only way I could grab it. It sunk deep into my palm, but I was able to take possession of it, flip it, and jab it into Clayton’s wrist. His grip loosened and I freed my hand, looking around for the gun. Where was the damn gun? Beverly moved to the edge of the bed. I spied the gun laying on the edge of the bed. Instead of going for it I concentrated on Beverly. I punched her in the face, knocking her back into the trailer wall. I then grabbed the gun. As I looked up to point it at Beverly, she smashed the lantern in my face, burning my skin and cutting my lip and cheek. The lantern dropped to the floor. I heard the trailer door slam and then an engine outside start, as Beverly made her escape. \n\nThe cheap shag carpet had caught fire, shadow and light flickering across the room, exposing an empty bed. The body, Clayton, or whatever, had gotten up. I looked around the room, my eyes stinging with smoke. I couldn’t locate him. From behind I was grabbed in a deadly embrace. I suddenly had the uncontrollable urge to put the gun to my temple and pull the trigger. I also had the urge to do it while standing in the growing fire, immersing myself in as much pain as possible. Clayton let go of me, but the urge didn’t. I walked toward the flames, the hair on my arms began to singe and my flesh started bubbling with the escaping heat. Out of nowhere I heard a small still voice, “I love you Booby.” My mind was released. I turned and shot Clayton in the face, freeing him from his years of torment. Just to be safe though, I dragged his body to the fire and let him be consumed. \n\nI got into my car and drove away. In the rear-view mirror, I could see the flames had started to move across the exterior of the trailer, roof partially collapsing.  I have never seen anything in the news about it. I assumed that Beverly was part of a sinister organization that did its best to cover up the whole affair. She had escaped… or so she thought. Two more years came and went. The whisper was back. I found Beverly, not physically, but mentally. Her real name was Deborah Jackson. She was a schoolteacher. One night I had a vision. A large white serpent approached me from the tall green grass. It lifted up and looked me in the eye, its tongue tasting the air. The white serpent coiled around my whole body, laying its heavy head on my shoulder. I was passive, a willing participant. I saw Beverly in front of me. I may not have been there physically, but I was deep in her head, making her do unspeakable things to herself.",

        "text": "My wife Mercedes travels a few times a year for business, and she’d always bring me back a souvenir of some sort: a corny t-shirt, a magnet, a keychain. But on this last trip, she brought back something else entirely and it’s ruined our marriage – if not our lives.\n\nWe’ve been together for almost two decades, but our routine after she returned from a trip was always the same. I’d meet her the airport, she’d text when she landed, and give me a running hug in the baggage claim. I’d try to help her with her bag, which she always refused, even when it weighed more than she does. We’d share everything we did in our days apart, from the exciting to the mundane.\n\nThis last time was different. She’d called me the night before her flight, we exchanged the normal ‘I love you’s, but that was last normal thing that’s occurred in my life since.\n\nShe never texted me that she’d made it in. I was at the baggage claim, people had already gathered, bags were coming out, but Mercedes just wasn’t there.\n\nI waited, I texted, I called. Nothing.\n\nWith every moment that went by, I grew more and more worried – At first, I wondered if she’d never actually made it to the airport, but saw her baby blue suitcase slowly circle by. \n\nUnsure of what else to do, I kept calling, until I finally heard her ringtone coming from nearby, audible over the conversations and whirring of machinery now that most people had cleared out. That’s when I noticed her for the first time.\n\nShe’d been on the other side of the machine the entire time, but she was unrecognizable. As I approached her, she looked past me, as if I were a stranger. Her hair was messy and matted to her face, her clothes were stained and she had rough and jagged cuts at the corners of her mouth, bruises beginning to bloom across her jaw.\n\nShe stared emotionlessly into the distance as her bag passed by us multiple times; didn’t even comment when I finally grabbed it.\n\nIn the privacy of our car I tried to ask if she was okay, what had happened – clearly something was wrong – but on her end the ride home was silent. Pierced only by a wet sounding cough she’d developed.\n\nFor a while after we returned home, she seemed better and more like herself. There would be those rough moments when she’d fall back into that confused and disheveled state, but they were brief. \n\nAs time went on, though, the lapses became longer. We’d be mid conversation – she’d be mid laugh  when her face would go slack, she was gone again.\n\nEventually, she’d wander around as if lost in our own home – she would forget where she was and who I was. I’d even seen her stare up at the ceiling for hours at a time. She stopped eating, but she still looked healthy enough.\n\nI called our doctor and he was as concerned as I was, but she absolutely refused to go see him. \n\nEvery few nights since she’s been home, like clockwork, Mercedes leaves the house and slides out into the darkness. Any time I would bring it up, if she was even aware enough to register my words, it’d result in an argument – she still straight up denies that she’s even leaving at all, but our video doorbell says otherwise. \n\nAnd that terrifies me, because of the deaths that have begun plaguing our town. \n\nThe first body was found two weeks ago. My buddy Ron’s wife is a police officer and told me he heard it almost looked like an animal attack based on the sheer brutality.\n\nIt wasn’t long before the old Mercedes – my Mercedes – was gone entirely. She’d have the occasional moment where she seemed to recognize me, but there was no longer any of her gentleness or humor left behind those eyes. Instead, in the rare moments of clarity, I felt as if observed by a predator calculating their next move.\n\nNot long after, her boss called the house because she had stopped showing up to work entirely – it sounded like she wasn’t the even only one of her coworkers to do so.\n\nSince then, she’s only gotten worse. On top of her deteriorating psychological state, her physical health hasn’t improved either – in fact, she’s begun coughing up concerning things, like writhing long strips of something, and bits of cloth and hair. \n\nAnd teeth. I don’t think they were her own, either.\n\nI think I finally found out where she’s going and who she’s with, and it’s worse than I ever could have imagined.\n\nAbout a week ago, I awoke gasping, struggling to catch my breath. Mercedes was kneeling on my chest, prying my mouth open with both hands with such ferocity that I kept expecting to hear a sickening crack. She stared at me with a purposeful and intense focus, eyes wild and dilated, only inches from my own. I remember feeling waves of searing pain, almost as if something was boring its way through my soft palate.\n\nI tried telling myself it was just a vivid nightmare, but my jaw ached so much the next morning, and I’ve developed a headache since then that still hasn’t gone away. \n\nOur marriage has been falling apart and the situation in town has gone from bad to worse, too.\n\nThey found another body in the park near our home just a few days ago. Ron told me he heard that they’d ruled out a robbery – the victim was still wearing her diamond earrings – well one at least, on the half of her head that wasn’t missing – and clutching a purse that was full of cash. \n\nI’m starting to wonder if they’ll even solve any of these cases. The last time I saw Ron’s wife in town, in a departure from her usual friendly nature, she walked right past me with a now familiar look of detached vacancy on her face.\n\nIf that weren’t bad enough, I don’t even have my health – I think whatever Mercedes has, I’ve caught it too. I can’t shake the feeling that there’s something wet lodged deep within in my lungs that I can’t get out, sometimes I even swear it feels like it’s moving. The coughing, coupled with the searing pain at the base of my skull has made the past week unbearable.\n\nAccording to our doorbell footage, I’ve recently joined Mercedes when she leaves at night, but I don’t remember a single moment of it. I realized I’m losing track of hours at a time.\n\nOur daughter Fallon came home for a few days during spring break recently – I could’ve sworn I told her not to come, that her mom and I were sick and I didn’t want her to catch it – but she told me I called non-stop and that I actually *begged* her to come home and see us.\n\nBefore she went back to her shared dorm room, she had begun acting oddly – walking around looking dazed, and started to develop the same cough as her mom and I.\n\nNow that I think I’ve found out what my wife is doing at night, I’m terrified of the thought of what will happen now that my daughter has just returned to a college campus packed with people.\n\nThere’s something else that scares me too, that I haven’t told anyone else.\n\nThis morning, I finally thought I was getting better when I managed to cough something up – but then I saw what it was.\n\nLong squirming things. And a single ornate diamond stud earring.\n\nI know something is terribly wrong, but I don’t know what to do about [it.](https://www.reddit.com/user/JamFranz/comments/11or7ez/hello_and_welcome/)",

        "text": "I was 13 when it happened. I was in girl scouts, and the meetings always took place at my old elementary school(for grades 1st-4th). I always found it nostalgic, yet somewhat creepy. My dad often brought me early. I'd let myself in and stay in there for often up to 40 minutes until someone showed up. My dad refused to bring me at the time I told him too. He thought I was being rude. But, this one small problem would become something bigger. It was just after daylight savings time had happened. My dad kept telling me it was a week later, but he was wrong. Both my mom and I knew this. He brought me to girl scouts 2 hours early. Said I was only 10 minutes early according to his clock. He was very wrong. I knew that. But, I went in anyways. I found being early interesting. I remember that there was a storm coming. I thought my leaders were crazy for letting GS happen that night. The storm had already started, but it was light. Within 30 minutes though, it had gotten worse. Very worse. I couldn't see outside due to the fast snow flakes. I got a notification from the app that my troop leaders said important info from. GS had been canceled. I decided to call my dad, but there was no service. Wifi was very bad there. I decided to leave the school in hopes for better wifi, but to my shock the door was stuck. I cursed under my breath. I was stuck in a school I hadn't really ventured through (besides the art room 2 halls away) for 5 years. I barely remembered where the gym was, let alone any of the important spots (bathroom, my old classroom that always had a box of food in it). I had no idea how long I'd be here for. I decided to go back to the art room. All of my things (except my phone that was with me) was in that room. But, to my dismay, while I was on my way there the lights cut. \"NO!\" I shouted out loud. I was in the dark with nothing more then the slight light of my phone. I scrambled to turn on the flashlight on my phone. But, for some reason, it didn't work. My phone was rather old, and I needed a new one. \"Turn on you-\" suddenly I stopped talking. I had heard a click. Like a camera. That's when I got an idea. I could turn on my flash and use that as a flashlight! I would delete the photos later. I used that to make my way to the art room. Once I got there, I checked my camera roll. My heart dropped. There was a dark figure standing at the end of the hallway in the first photo. I quickly flipped through the photos as the creature got closer, but not close enough to tell what it was. Right before I got to the last one I got a call. The name was \"&gt;#*÷^(÷&amp;÷(@&lt;÷÷&amp;[÷&amp;÷÷*#^÷*#&amp;#*#*#;#*#&amp;#&amp;92&lt;3[3_3\" . The number was familiar as well.  I can't tell you, because it was my friends' number. I thought maybe she was there too. Pranking me. She was in GS too, after all. I picked it up. But, all there was only breathing. It was like an old man and an old woman was both breathing at the same time in the same way. But, that wasn't the creepiest part. In the background, I heard my OWN heavy breathing. I mumbled \"what the F\" to myself and low and behold, in the background I heard myself mumble \"what the F\". Then, the lights came back. The line went dead. That's when I remembered. There wasn't wifi. How did I get a call? I slowly looked up. I almost screamed at what I saw. The art room's phone was dangling over the desk. I was alone though. I then remembered that there was another door. It was in the gym. An emergency exit. Always locked from the outside, but unlocked on the inside. It led into a field. I gripped onto my phone tightly(so I wouldn't drop it) and quickly got up. Forget my coat, earbuds, and sash. I needed to get the hell out of dodge before the lights cut again. I ran into the hallway. I had no idea where the gym was, but I remembered the doors were big and orange. I got around 2 hallways before the lights started flashing. There was snow on the power cord that was weighing down so hard that it was making the lights flicker. I felt the thing running after me every time the lights flickered off. I didn't care though, as the big orange doors were right ahead. The doors were very heavy. Either that, or I was very weak. But, I managed to open them AND actually get a look at what I was running from. I almost passed out from shock. There was a very thin and tall creature running at me on all fours. It was unhumanly fast. It didn't have hands or feet. Just nubs. It was slipping as it ran from not having feet or hands. It was white. It had no eyes, but a carved smile. Made from a carving knife. It's loud breathing mimicked that of the breathing I had heard in the phone call. IT HAD BEEN IN THE SAME ROOM AS ME IN THE DARK. I ran into the gym as quickly as I could. I almost immediately noticed the emergency door.  I ran as quickly as I could through the gigantic gym and got out. The thing followed me outside. I ran towards the fence. It was dark out, so the thing was completely there. I jumped the fence. It was specifically for small children to not be able to cross without the help of an adult so I easily jumped it. The thing on the other hand did not easily cross. The nubs did not help it. There was a police station across the road. I went in and reported it. I was laughed at in the face and told to go home instead of wasting both of our time. I was never believed and even got in trouble for getting the police involved. I don't know what happened to it afterward.",

        "text": "The old mansion I want to warn you about is located near Ravenswood, a small town nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains. I had heard about the mansion  from the townspeople, who whispered about it in hushed tones like it was a forbidden secret. They said that it had been abandoned for decades, ever since the last member of the family that had once lived there disappeared without a trace. Some said that the family had been involved in satanic rituals and devil worship, and that the mansion was now cursed by their evil deeds.\n\nBut I had always brushed off their stories as mere superstition, until one day I found myself standing before the mansion's looming facade. The sky above was overcast, with a storm brewing in the distance, and the trees that surrounded the mansion rustled ominously in the wind. Despite the creepy atmosphere, I felt drawn to the mansion like a moth to a flame.\n\nAs I approached the front door, I could see that the mansion was in a state of decay. The walls were cracked and overgrown with ivy, and the once-grand entrance was now a dilapidated mess. Broken glass from the shattered windows littered the ground, and the few remaining panes were clouded with grime and dirt.\n\nDespite the obvious signs of neglect, it was like it was alive, pulsing with a malevolent energy that I could feel in my bones. The closer I got to the front door, the more my heart pounded in my chest, as if warning me to turn back before it was too late.\n\nBut I couldn't resist the pull of the mansion, the curiosity that gnawed at me like a hungry beast. It was as if a voice was whispering in my thoughts, urging me to explore the mansion's secrets. The voice was soft and insidious, tempting me with promises of forbidden knowledge and untold treasures. I tried to ignore it, but the more I resisted, the stronger the voice became, until it was all I could hear.\n\n“Come… Come closer…”\n\nAnd so I reached out to push open the front door, and the hinges creaked loudly as it swung inward, revealing the dark abyss within. The voice in my head grew louder, urging me forward with every step I took. It was like I was no longer in control of my own actions, like the voice had taken over my mind and was leading me towards some unspeakable fate.\n\nAs I stepped inside the mansion, the voice in my head grew even stronger, and I could feel its influence spreading through my body like a virus. I was no longer just curious about the mansion's secrets; I was obsessed with uncovering them, no matter the cost.\n\nWould I find signs of the cultists? Of the family that had owned the building long ago? \n\nAs I delved deeper into the mansion's dark and twisted corridors, I knew that I was heading towards something far beyond my comprehension, something that no mortal mind was meant to witness. But the voice in my head wouldn't let me turn back now. It had drawn me to the mansion for a reason, and I was powerless to resist its call.\n\nI couldn't help but wonder if there were any traces of the cultists who had once supposedly practiced unspeakable acts. I envisioned finding altars and sacrificial knives, forbidden tomes filled with ancient spells and incantations, and relics imbued with otherworldly power. I imagined uncovering the remains of the family that had once lived here, their corpses twisted and contorted into grotesque shapes by the dark forces they had summoned. As disturbing as these thoughts were, they only fueled my curiosity further. I was determined to discover the truth about this mansion, no matter how horrific it might be.\n\nAs I stepped into the mansion's grand foyer, I realized with a start that it was much larger on the inside than it appeared from the outside - the impossible vastness of the interior seemed to defy the laws of physics, as if the house existed in some other realm altogether. There were too many corridors and hallways as well, but the voice made me ignore that fact.\n\nAs I explored the mansion's winding hallways, I finally noticed a door that stood out from the others. It was made of a dark wood that seemed to absorb the light, and strange symbols had been etched into its surface. The door beckoned to me like a siren's call, and I felt an almost magnetic pull towards it. But as I approached, I heard something moving on the other side. At first, it was just a faint rustling, but as I drew closer, the sound grew louder and more distinct. It was like something was scratching at the door from the other side, trying to break through.\n\nMy heart pounding in my chest, I hesitated for a moment, wondering what kind of horror lay beyond the door. But the voice in my head urged me forward, promising that whatever I sought was just beyond my reach. And so, with a deep breath, I reached out and turned the doorknob. The door creaked open slowly, revealing a darkness so absolute that it seemed to swallow the light from the corridor, though no creature or monster as part of me had suspected.\n\nBut as the door opened wider, I could hear the sound of something shuffling towards me from the darkness, a low growl emanating from its throat. I knew then that I had made a grave mistake, that whatever was on the other side of that door was far more dangerous than anything I had encountered before. I could feel the fear rising inside me like a tide. The voice in my head, which had once seemed so seductive and alluring, was now drowned out by the terror that gripped my heart. I realized then that I had been foolish to come to this place. And so, with a sudden burst of courage, I turned and ran back the way I had come, the sound of the creature's approach echoing behind me.\n\nI could hear the sound of its breathing growing louder and more ragged as it drew closer. I imagined seeing a monstrous shape in the darkness, claws, contorted eyes and a terrible maw. I stumbled through the dark corridors, my heart pounding in my chest, my mind consumed with thoughts of escape. The voice in my head had fallen silent, replaced now by the primal urge to survive.\n\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity, I burst through the front door of the mansion and stumbled out into the cool night air. I collapsed on the ground, gasping for breath, my heart still racing with fear. It was only then that I realized how close I had come to death, and how lucky I was to have escaped with my life. \n\nI urge anyone who might come across the old mansion on the outskirts of Ravenswood to steer clear, even out of curiosity. These places hold secrets that are better left undiscovered, and the things that dwell within their walls might be beyond the scope of human understanding. The creature that pursued me, the one that had probably been summoned by dark and twisted cultists, was like nothing I had imagined before. \n\nI am now sure: Old mansions and abandoned buildings that dot the landscape can be breeding grounds for unspeakable horrors, and those who venture too close do so at their own peril. Those who dare to venture inside may never return. So, I implore you, stay away from these places. For once you've seen what lies within, you can never unsee it.",

        "text": "We’re on week three. I was losing my mind before week one was over. Neonatal intensive care unit. The NICU. It’s where they send babies who aren’t quite ready to go home for one reason or another. Birthing complications, abnormalities, premature births (they call them the “preemies”), or whatever. It’s not a place anyone wants to go to, but damn will you be glad it’s there. I don’t know if I can take much more after what I found. But it’s for my daughter, right? To make sure she has the healthiest possible start to her life. That’s what a good responsible parent does. That’s why we’re still here.\n\nWe’ll call my daughter Sue, and my wife Zara. Sue should have been fine. No pregnancy complications, Apgar (that’s a little test they do right after birth to check the newborn’s health) score of 9 out of ten, she didn’t seem to have too much trouble latching onto mom to nurse, and she had two parents eager to take her home and get their new lives started. She seemed like a perfectly healthy, and screamy, newborn girl.\n\nBut the nurses at our first hospital were concerned about her rapid breathing. They had us wait to go home until they ran some tests. For three days, we sat there in a mix of horrible dread, and the sort of excitement/fear only new parents can feel, while they monitored her. Then, on the day we were supposed to go home, the tests found “high levels of acid” in her, so they assumed she had something called “neonatal metabolic acidosis” which I think means she’s producing more acids and gasses than her body can get rid of, leading to rapid breathing, which then made feeding difficult. They couldn’t find a cause or confirmation of anything, so they shipped us off to the NICU.\n\nAt first they put her on oxygen. That actually helped with the breathing. Her acid levels went down with her breathing purer O2, and after a few days we could take her off those tubes and she could breathe fine. Her acidosis had resolved itself. “So we can leave now, right?” We wondered.\n\n“We’ve noticed she isn’t eating as much as she should.” They told us. “It could be connected to her previous condition and we’d like to keep monitoring her.” Three more days of waiting and sleeping on an awful hospital cot ensued. After that, NICU doctors still weren’t comfortable discharging us until her feedings balanced out, but meanwhile, they kept finding more things to be worried about. “We want to run this test to make sure her eating troubles aren’t neurological. We’ll run that test in three days.” Three days later we’re told “the test came back great! But now we want to run another test to make sure she’s not aspirating. The soonest we can do that is in another three days.”\n\nOn, and on, and on. We slept in the hospital for the first week (in a room we weren’t allowed to eat in). In the second week, we were put up by a charity organization, so we had beds and hot meals again. We still spent most of our time in the NICU with our baby. My spouse saw a lactation consultant the whole time, because she wasn’t producing enough to feed our girl by herself, and I watched that grow into self loathing in her mind. I could see it in her face, every time Shae screamed in frustration while she was nursing. Pumping kept both of us awake even when we were in the quiet of the charity house. So stress built up for both of us.\n\nJust to add to that, my vacation time is running out, because American healthcare is fucking garbage and there’s no parental leave for my job. So that’s weighing on us. Our cats at home are being fed by strangers (to them), and we’re constantly exhausted. But here we have access to donor milk, so we know our girl is getting all the food she needs. The doctors know what they’re doing. I trust them. I think their system is ruled by politics, which is needlessly stressing us out, but I have to believe the experts know best. The nurses have all been amazing and supportive. They’re happy to watch the baby while we get some actual sleep.\n\nIt can be hard to maintain a positive attitude though. It gets more and more frustrating. The hospital has these  strict schedules it wants us to keep. Feedings, and pumping sessions every three hours, and she has to finish a certain amount. First it was 45 ml. Then it was 60. Then 70. And Sue was always perfectly happy to pass out and go to sleep long before her bottle was empty. But she was nursing too. So maybe she was getting all she needed from mom after all? But maybe not. It’s best to stay with the doctors so they can make extra sure. Or is it? I have no fucking clue. The problem is she’s tired when she eats, right? So my wife and I wondered why we didn’t feed her first, and have the nurse run their tests after. That way she’s not upset about being poked and prodded for a few minutes when we feed her. She’d have more energy. Some nurses were happy to oblige. And you know what? Sue did eat more. Not all the nurses wanted to change it up though. They insisted it was Hospital policy that they do things the way they do, because it allows them to chart and monitor her growth and her vitals. “Well why can’t we change up the schedule? Sometimes she’s hungry, and starts screaming an hour before feeding and wears herself out by feeding time?” Once again, hospital policy in the NICU. Are we doing what’s best? I wish I knew.\n\nI’m frustrated with the hospital, I’m angry for my wife, who hates that she’s not producing enough for our daughter, I hate my job for pressuring me to return, I hate this country for discouraging all of us from fighting for paternity leave and childcare benefits, I hate Donald Trump and the Republican Party for those and a variety of other reasons (Fox News, a channel popular with American Conservatives (and consequently full of bullshit talk shows) ends up on the communal tv a lot), and I’m getting really tired of listening to my daughter scream at me.\n\nBut now, I’m scared.\n\nI found this journal. It’s one of those “newborn” journals with fun little things to write so you can document the birthing process and your child’s growth. I assumed it belonged to whoever was stuck in this NICU room before we were.\n\nI found it lodged behind the couch. It looks old, but the date on it is only from a year ago. Zara needed a break. She was staying with her parents for a day, to catch up on sleep as much as possible. So I was alone when I found the thing. I’d just gotten done feeding Sue a bottle (and pouring most of it down the NG tube). She screamed for another ten minutes, but miraculously, this time, she fell asleep. If she stayed that way, I’d have maybe an hour to myself. Two if I was lucky. I was too damn tired to game, or websurf or anything, but I was too wired to sleep. So I sat on the cot, and by some random chance, I noticed the sound. Just a little thump. I investigated and I found the journal.\n\nIt was a dirty little pink thing, with “The Story of You” printed on the front in flowery gold ribbon-like letters. I knew it wasn’t our birth journal. Zara had taken that with her. Curious, I opened it up. The usual stuff was there. Lots of places for the parents to fill in details and write anecdotes.\n\n*This is the journal of Bethany born April 9th, 2022*\n\n*Mommy: Carla Daddy: Ford*\n\n*Our note to you: We can’t believe it finally happened! We’ve finally met you! You’re more beautiful than we could have ever imagined! We have your room ready. We can’t wait to bring you home! Our lives begin anew! We love you Bethany!*\n\nThat was the first page. There were places for photos, but those were all empty. I guess they never got the chance. I was kind of wistful and sad for a moment. After all, some family had left their book of memories behind. The best case scenario there, was that they dropped it and forgot about it. But this is the Neonatal intensive Care Unit. It’s more likely there was a tragedy. That seemed even more likely as I flipped through the pages. These parents had jotted down a lot. They were ready for this baby, and they were as excited as a couple can be about it. There was a whole page where I’m guessing her mom wrote a whole essay about how much she adored her new bundle of joy. We both felt that way a few weeks ago… But the point is, these people were stoked. Their baby was everything to them. No way in hell they would leave their book of memories behind if this had a happy ending.\n\nI can’t say for sure what really happened to these people, but the journal told a strange and impossible tale.\n\nAbout halfway through the journal, the writing in it changed. It wasn’t parents filling in sections anymore. They ignored the blank spaces and the writing, and wrote top to bottom, over top of the anecdotes and the little squares to put pictures. It was like they were keeping an actual journal. Here is what they wrote:\n\n*Something is wrong. Not with Bethany. We’ve been here for three weeks. Nothing is freaking wrong with our baby, but they still don’t feel comfortable letting us leave. The doctor said “we don’t want you to have to come back.” Who gives a shit? We’ll come back if something goes wrong! Let us go home and figure out our new lives! But no. More tests. More monitoring, and now? Something royally fucked up is going on. It took way too long for me to notice, but I’m tired. Hell, I’m exhausted. It was three o'clock in the morning when Carla left to have a soda in the lounge. She said she would be right back, as it would be time to nurse soon. One of our nurses dropped off a bottle of donor milk and stuck it in the warmer too. That was the last person I saw.*\n\n*I had dozed off. I was startled awake by Beth’s crying. My phone was mysteriously dead. The clock on the wall said about an hour had gone by since my wife left. The whole floor was dark and mostly quiet. There were a few beeps of machinery, and whirs from vents and computers, of course, but I swear the building sounded empty. Just me, and my baby, who was screaming for food. I was really confused. The bottle was still sitting in the warmer. Had the nurses not come by to feed her? They’re supposed to. We insist on feeding whenever we’re here, but the nurses have to document her vitals and make sure she gets the necessary amount. And where the hell was Carla?*\n\n*What could I do? We must have just had a really busy nurse. So I grabbed the bottle, and I fed little Bethany. She downed the whole bottle in less than five minutes. It was insane. She’s never eaten like that. Not in all her time alive. I was alarmed, but happy. Her eating was one of the things her doctor was worried about. I burped her and held her in my arms, preparing for the screaming and the battle of wills that came with trying to rock her to sleep. But the screaming never came. She lay there in my arms and just stared at me with those big blue eyes. I smiled and cooed at her, happy as a father can be, but she just kept staring. It was pretty creepy if I’m being honest. But she was fed, and calm. I changed her diaper, dressed her, swaddled her, and set her back in her bassinet. She stared at me the whole time.*\n\n*With her taken care of, I decided to see where our nurse was, and find my wife. I kind of wanted to get away from Beth’s staring eyes too. So I walked out into the hall, and that’s where I started to freak out. The place was empty. No human beings. No nurse, no doctors, no janitors, no technicians, no other parents, and no other babies. Most of the lights were off, but there was definitely some machinery still working. Still. It was like I was suddenly in an abandoned hospital. Even worse? My card to get in and out doesn’t work. I’m stuck on this floor of the NICU. The lounge with the soda machine is right outside that door. I couldn’t see my wife in there, but I couldn’t see the whole room either.*\n\n*I went from one room too the next, getting more and more panicked. Every bassinet was empty, every desk, every bathroom. There was nobody. There were signs of life, people’s clothes, an open book sitting on a table, some computers still running at their desks, but there was nobody. Had there been some sort of emergency that I missed? Had the nurses somehow forgotten about me? Had my wife not said anything? I gave myself whatever excuse I could think of. Some bizarre set of circumstances had trapped me and my baby on this floor. But it was temporary, and they’d all be back in time. What else could I do? I went back to our room, and sat with Bethany. She’s still staring at me like a little freak. I looked out our window to see if I could spot any signs of life, but it was pitch black. I couldn’t see anything. “There must be a power outage. Everything will be fine,” I told myself.*\n\n*Well… it’s been three days. My wife never came back, no nurses ever arrived, and the sun never came up. I’m still stuck here waiting, but this isn’t natural. What could possibly keep the outside sky so black? Where the hell are we? And why won’t Bethany stop staring at me? She cries when she’s hungry. I had to break into one of the staff rooms and raid their fridge for a jug of donor milk, but it’s the only one, and it’s not going to last forever. I don’t know what I’m gonna do. My food is gone. I can steal stuff from the communal fridge for a while, but I have no fucking clue what I’m going to do to feed Beth. She can’t eat solids yet. Maybe there’s more donor milk somewhere. What the hell am I going to do? Where the fuck am I?*\n\nThat was the first entry. I sympathized with that guy a lot. It sounded like he was in a very similar state of frustration as me before he got “lost.” I feel lost and trapped here too. But Christ. What the hell happened to him? It couldn’t be real, could it? It only gets weirder after that. Impossible even. I mean, just look at this next passage:\n\n*There’s something in here with us. It’s not human. I don’t think it has eyes. I saw it at the end of the hallway, crawling on the ceiling like an insect. It didn’t react to us at all. I had Bethany strapped to my chest, and at that moment, she decided to cry. Then the thing whipped a head toward me, and it freaking roared. No eyes, no mouth, just teeth, and a humanoid body. It dropped from the ceiling and came bounding towards us. I ran for the nearest room and barricaded us inside. I don’t know what to do. I need to feed Bethany. But what? Oh great. I cut myself.*\n\nMonsters in the NICU? This is someone’s project. It has to be. One of the interns fancies themself a writer. Still. I don’t know. I hear weird noises at night. I figured it was just stress and a lack of sleep. It sounded like someone yelled “breath” or something down the hall a few days ago. But maybe it was “Beth?”\n\nThe last few entries get… unhinged:\n\n*I killed the thing. I smashed it with a chair until it’s squealing stopped. I’m eating part of it now. No way to cook it, so what else can I do? At least I can get water from the sinks. Is it really water? It doesn’t look clear. I did find a way to feed Beth. It hurts, but if I can keep myself alive I should be able to keep us going. She couldn’t get enough. She crawled toward my cut and latched right on. I’ve never seen her eat like that. She needs to stop staring at me. She’s still a newborn baby, but she looks a lot less vulnerable and delicate to me. Still, she’s my daughter.*\n\nYikes. Here’s a short entry:\n\n*More things. Not like the first. Not sure how many. I’m hiding. I can’t get to water. I need to feed Beth. I’m feeling weak. I gave her too much. I think she’s gotten bigger. Still won’t stop staring at me.*\n\nThe only reason I’m not really freaking out is that it’s still daytime here. No black void outside my window. I’m pretty sure I saw a nurse a bit ago. I think I’m safe. The next entry is the last:\n\n*I gave her everything I had left. The things came and ate part of me. My legs, one of my arms, a bunch of my torso. I don’t know how I’m alive. There’s so much blood. But I don’t feel any pain. The monsters helped me write this. I’m not sure why. I thought about writing and they brought my journal and helped me move my hand. They talked to me too. No clue how. Only one of them has a mouth, and it definitely can’t do speech.  They say a “beast” must be fed. They thanked me for my “contribution,” then they took Beth. I tried to protest, but they explained that it was best for her to remain. Then they left me here. I have one arm. I’m dying. I’m trying so hard to finish this writing alone, but I’m so weak.  I did it for you Beth. I gave you the best start I could. I love you.*\n\nWhile I was transcribing that, a nurse arrived. I might have sighed out loud in relief. I asked them about previous families, but they said they couldn’t keep track. I don’t know if Carla, Bethany, and Ford were real or not. But I’m getting the fuck out of here. Whether the staff like it or not, I'm not letting anything happen to Sue.\n\nUpdate:\n\nWe’re home. I yelled in ways I never thought I could. The doctors forced us to learn how to insert NG tubes into our daughters nose, and sent us off just to get rid of me. We’re safe. We’re out of that place. I don’t feel like I’m being sucked dry in there anymore. I haven’t forgotten what I found though. I looked into it. I found an obituary for a Bethany Shades, who died in the NICU last year. She had an unseen heart condition. Her mother, Carla, committed suicide days later. The father, Ford, disappeared. He’s on the missing persons list and everything.\n\nI don’t know what’s real. Whether it’s true or not, something sinister roams those hospital halls. It’s not the nurses, or the doctors or even the screaming newborns. It’s something else. It feeds on the families there. It brings stress to them and employees alike. I’m just glad I got out when we did. And I wish Sue would quit staring straight at me. I know her eyes aren’t developed enough to even see me from there.",

        "text": "They called it the Pixie’s Throne, although I always thought that was just a fancy name to reel in tourists. The ‘throne’ is actually two ancient oak trees that fused together at the summit of a tiny islet. Picture an arthritic hand reaching towards the sky, the spiralling trunks like a swollen wrist, the crisscrossed branches skeletal fingers.\n\nFor twenty Euros, fishermen will take you out onto the Lough for a closer look. And hell, if you don’t believe the old stories, you can even climb up there and take a selfie. I’d caution against this, though. Because you might receive a hard lesson on what happens whenever the throne’s custodians take offence.\n\nI know I did...\n\nThe story began on a clear night with me vomiting scud water over a muddy bank. Above me, three orange lights circled one another as if locked in orbit, gradually merging into a single point. A campfire. \n\nPart of me wanted to lay flat until the darkness took hold. Despite this temptation, I crawled along on my elbows and knees until my hand touched a smooth, flat rock—the first of many on the island’s Western side. I dragged myself up the crude stairway.\n\nSilhouetted against the pale moonlight, the throne loomed large and ominous. Between me and it the fire lay amongst downed logs. I staggered to my feet and rasped for help, cold water sloshing in my boots.\n\n“Who’s there?” a voice shouted back.\n\nMy awareness returned in heavy, terrible increments. I spotted a small, silhouetted figure and fumbled toward it. “P-p-please h-h-help.”\n\n“Oh crap, you’re soaked. Here.”\n\nA woolly blanket got thrust into my chest, then slipped away just as my right hand reached out.\n\nThere came laughter. “Aww, I’m sorry mister. I’m just messing with you. Here.” It was a boy, one whose voice sounded familiar. \n\n“T-t-thanks,” I said, huddled under the blanket.\n\n“Don’t thank me,” he said sharply. “Warm yourself by the fire.”\n\nAs I dropped onto the log and massaged my skull, huge water droplets spilled onto the flames and hissed.\n\nOnce my teeth stopped chattering, the boy said, “It’s a bit stupid, isn’t it? Going for a swim this late at night?”\n\n“Yeah. A little.”\n\n“A little?” He snorted. “The water must be *freezing*. Aren’t you *freezing* mister? Look, your lips are all blue.”\n\n“Thanks, kid. I get it.”\n\n“Aww, I’m just having fun.”\n\nGreat. I was getting teased by a nine-year-old. This was a new low, even for me.\n\nStill struggling to see because of the brain fog, I said, “Where are your parents?”\n\nHe shrugged. “Hey wanna hear a joke? What did the ocean say to the river?”\n\n“I don’t care.” I cupped my hands, breathed into them.\n\nThe kid muttered something too low to hear before tossing a log onto the fire.\n\nSurging flames illuminated familiar features; blue eyes and blonde hair styled in a bowl cut. Confused, I squeezed my eyes shut, massaged my temples, and took another look. My companion had a thin nose and ears that stuck out too wide, same as mine.\n\nWas this an early symptom of hypothermia?\n\n“I can’t lie mister, I saw what you did,” the youngster said, jabbing a thumb at the throne. “Isn’t it a silly thing to do? *My* mom would throw a fit if I did something like that.”\n\nAh, of course—this was a dream. Any second now I’d wake up in bed, nice and toasty. \n\nAs I chuckled away, the perfect illusion tilted its head to one side. “What’s so funny?”\n\n“Thanks for the help,” I said, throwing the blanket on his lap.\n\nI started back down the stairway. Trees and hedges crowded the islet’s outer edge. In the darkness, I pushed through barriers of low branches, navigating around exposed roots and shallow ditches. My rowboat had to be around there somewhere. Maybe I could wake myself by casting off?\n\nThrough the gaps between trees, little sparkles danced around, disappearing the instant my eye settled on one. They felt like countless eyes tiptoeing over my skin.\n\nThe muddy landscape carried me toward jagged rocks jutting out of the Lough. The crashing waves made a hypnotic *slop-slop-slop* while, high above them, the throne’s branches crawled over the cliff’s edge. You’d need a miracle to survive a fall from up there. \n\nI doubled back, circled the island. On my fifth or sixth lap, I repeatedly screamed, “Help,” my cries cracking off every trunk in the vicinity.\n\nClearly, there was no escaping this mirage. So I shuffled back up the steps. \n\nI approached the little imposter, who kept himself busy stoking the flames. He was all knobby elbows and scabby knees, clothed in misfitting garments scraped together from donation bins.\n\n“Okay,” I said, “don’t get weirded out by this, but you’re me, right? Like…a younger me?” \n\n“Looks that way, huh?”\n\n“So, this is a dream?”\n\n“Does it feel like a dream?”\n\nI coughed up a soggy leaf, pinched myself several times. Nope. Too real.\n\n“So I’m dead? Is this heaven? Or”—invisible hands closed around my windpipe—\"the other place?”\n\n“I don’t think your dead mister.”\n\n“Then what’s going on?”\n\nHe shrugged. \n\nDesperate for a drink, I patted my pockets. Empty.\n\n“Looking for this?” In his left hand, he had a silver hipflask.\n\n“How did…give me that.”\n\nI grabbed for it, but he leaned away. “Answer my question first.”\n\n“You little troll.” I held his wrist, pried the fingers off the flask one at a time, and then necked the remaining whiskey. With my insides warmed, I dropped onto the log beside him.\n\n\"You don't have much of a sense of humour, do you?\" he asked. \n\n“And you’re quite the detective.”\n\nFor a while we listened to the fire crackling away. Finally, he said, “Just tell me.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Please.”\n\n“Drop it.”\n\n“Tell me tell me tell me—”\n\n“Enough already.”\n\n“—tell me tell me. Go on, *tell me*.”\n\n“No. You wouldn’t understand.”\n\n“Oh yes I would.” He stomped his foot. “Tell me. Tell me tell me TELL ME—” \n\n“Stop,” I snapped.\n\n“—TELL ME TELL ME TELL ME—\" He poked me in the chest, pushed my shoulder. “—TELL ME TELL ME—\" Finally, he leaned in close, took a deep breath, and put everything into one giant, “TELL ME!”\n\n“BECAUSE I WAS SCARED, OKAY?” \n\nThe little trickster made a puzzled expression. Ashamed, I faced the throne. \n\n“What were you scared *of*?” he asked.\n\n“I don’t know how to explain it.”\n\n“Try.”\n\n“It’s too complicated.”\n\n“Oh. Then how about showing me?”\n\n“…What?” I looked round at him.\n\nThe kid dragged me up by the arm and steered us around the fire. In the throne’s crooked shadow, there lay a brief, circular pond. The idea of holding my head underwater slid into my brain.\n\n“You can show me with this.” He motioned to dip my hand inside the pool.\n\nConfused, intrigued, I leaned forward. Reflected in the surface, the throne naked branches inhaled and exhaled, shivering. Between their thin lacings, I glimpsed more sparkles.\n\nThe youth spurred me on until, finally, I submerged my fingers.\n\nRipples pulsated from the point they touched. My hand reeled away in surprise, which made the doppelganger chuckle. “Look, it’s starting.”\n\nThe pond glowed, now alive with swirling, colourful blobs. Little by little, they morphed into faces and figures, until a clear image floated to the surface—me and my mom building a sandcastle. \n\n“What’s this?” I asked. The kid shushed me.\n\nAlready the past echo dispersed. “Wait, where did it go?” Before I could submerge my hand again, he snatched my wrist. “Just wait.”\n\nA steady stream of childhood echoes came and went: a blonde girl tearing up my Valentine’s card in front of the class; me playing goalie in the cup final for my football team, diving the wrong way to block the penalty that cost us the game; then Mom saying afterwards, “No pressure, no diamonds.”\n\nThese words sounded garbled, but audible.\n\nMy chest tightened watching myself arrive home after school only to find Mom’s eyes, her blue eyes which looked exactly like mine, red and puffed out. At the kitchen table, she clasped my hands tight and explained Dad was never coming home.\n\nMonths sped along in seconds. After school, I’d do my homework in the corner booth while Mom bussed tables and topped up coffees, helping with my math puzzles in whatever spare time she could scrape together. Throughout winter, we wore two thick jumpers a piece because we couldn’t afford to keep the heating on.\n\nThat year we exchanged homemade gifts on Christmas. My former self opened a stuffed dog Mom knitted me, then she beamed with joy as I presented a crayon picture of us beside a thatched, white cottage—the kind she always dreamed about buying someday.\n\nMy eyes welled up. That year was especially rough for us both.\n\nDespite the hardships, she kept me smiling and laughing. Then, before either of us knew it, I was holding an acceptance letter from the Dublin institute of technology to study architecture. The giant hug she gave me left my ribcage covered in ugly, purple bruises.\n\nAt first, I insisted on doing things myself in the big city. Complete independence. I was a grown man, after all. One who didn’t need his mommy.\n\nTake a wild guess where that got me. My insistent partying almost got me kicked out of university and caused me to burn through a stream of crappy, part-time jobs. Even still, I couldn’t quit drinking. After that first drop of alcohol touched my lips, I’d obsess over the sacrifices Mom made. Why had she given up so much for a loser like me? My classmates all drifted through their studies so effortlessly, whereas I felt like a fraud, like I wasn’t living up to my fullest potential. So I’d drink until I blacked out and wake up with my knuckles cut to shreds, the dorm wall covered with holes and dents.\n\nWeeks passed in a whirlwind of alcohol and tears until one night when I needed, physically needed, to hear my mother’s voice. Despite it being 3AM, she answered the phone and stayed on the line even though I never actually said what was wrong. We chatted until the sun came up.\n\nFrom there, I set aside my ego and called home frequently. Exam stressing me out? Better ask for advice. Girlfriend dumped me? Time for one of her patented worldclass peptalks. She never judged my choices or poor decisions. And she always signed off with, “No pressure, no diamonds.”\n\nWhile I worked toward my degree, she landed a job at an IT consultancy as a receptionist, and her employer soon realized she had the ‘gift of the gab’. Within two years she earned a promotion to head of her own department, facilities.\n\nAfter graduation, I accepted a job at a prestigious firm in London and oversaw projects in the Eastend. Halfway through an image of me supervising a construction site, the kid looked up and said, “You were an architect?”\n\nI nodded.\n\n“Cool. I mean, not *cool* cool like an astronaut or a train driver. But still cool.”\n\nBy now, I was watching myself suffer through a weekly spin class. In a desperate, transparent attempt to impress the brunette wearing pink yoga pants, I pedalled furiously from the word ‘go’, and after each session she dropped serious hints about me asking her out, although I could never summon the courage.\n\nWhen mama bear heard this, she said if I didn’t grow a pair within five days, she’d fly over to London and set us up herself. \n\nIn the next memory, the lady and I locked lips on a blanket in St. James’ Park, fireworks exploding overhead. \n\nMy younger self retched. “Sick.”\n\nFive months into our relationship, Ciara and I pulled up outside a white cottage at the edge of the forest near my hometown. Porcelain fairies, gnomes, and leprechauns stood guard around the perimeter, because Mom adored the ‘fae-folk’ stories the village used to drum up publicity and flog cheap souvenirs.\n\nThat first day, we took Ciara out on a little rowboat so that she could see the legendary ‘throne’ up close. She expressed mild disappointment over the lack of Pixie’s frolicking in the surrounding water, as promised by the local tourism board. Mom reminded her they'd be more likely to rip out your innards than pose for a picture according to the old tales.\n\nLater on, I ground my teeth while the two of them drank wine and flicked through old baby photos, both giggling away. They became instant besties, and at the wedding, the priest needed to shout our vows to be heard above Mom’s sobs.\n\nYears drifted by. Ciara and I furnished and decorated a cosy apartment in Stoke Newington, and in one image we tried making the most of a lazy Sunday by sleeping in late until a springer spaniel burst through the door and jumped up on the bed, leash in mouth.\n\n“You got a dog?” younger me asked.\n\n“We named him Toby,” I said, fingers hovering over the pond.\n\n“But things look pretty great. Well, I mean, the whole wife thing sucks. But you look…*happy*.”\n\nWith dread in the pit of my stomach, I said, “Keep watching.”\n\nPast me got woken by a late-night phone call. I caught the first flight to Ireland and drove to St. Luke’s hospital, where Mom lay in bed breathing through a respirator. When I grabbed her hand, those blue eyes rotated toward me. She even managed a thin smile. \n\nLater, a doctor pulled me aside and explained there was nothing more they could do.\n\nMemories lurched and shifted, whizzing past two or three at a time. Me in the lounge sobbing, Toby’s head rested against my lap. Bus tires screeching, followed by Toby making a guttural whimper, then me scratching his ear in a vet’s operating room one final time. Me going out to the bar and not returning home for days. Ciara and I arguing because she found bottles buried in the closet, despite my promises to quit drinking. I felt embarrassed watching this. It felt like the throne was staring down at me, passing silent judgement.\n\nI watched myself skip work, argue with bartenders, start pointless brawls, receive cautions from the police. In a way, it felt like seeing these events play out for the first time. That soul-shredding chapter of my life is still a blur.\n\nIf Mom had been around, she’d have pulled me out of the funk. What did I do now she was gone?\n\nI wanted to yell ‘stop’ at past me as the idiot ripped off his wedding ring in front of a sobbing Ciara.\n\nHe returned home to an empty, white cottage, his descent into alcoholism spiralling further and further out of control, quickly reaching a point where he only wanted to make the pain stop.\n\nLoaded up on whiskey one night, he took a rowboat out across the Lough, paddled toward the Pixie’s islet, and made his way to the summit on unsteady legs.\n\nHe eased himself into a comfortable seat on a recess in the throne’s front side, at the point where trunks converged. And in doing so, he officially committed the cardinal sin of sitting on the throne *without* paying tribute to the pixies. Or fae-folk. Whatever you wanna call them.\n\nHe chugged from his flask, hiccupped.\n\nSupernatural creatures hadn’t torn his skin off. Nor did they play jump rope with his intestines. That meant he needed to finish things the old-fashioned way.\n\nFirst, though, he pulled down his zipper. Because who wanted to die with a full bladder?\n\nOn the far side of the throne, he shuffled up against the cliff’s edge. Far below, violent waves crashed against rocks sharper than knives. You’d need a miracle to survive that fall.\n\nAfter a slow, steady breath, he stepped forward.\n\nThe reflections dispersed there. \n\n“I…see,” my counterpart said.\n\nI rubbed my neck, my mouth itching for more whiskey.\n\n“So that’s it then?” he asked.\n\n“That’s it.”\n\n“You just…gave up?”\n\nI shrugged.\n\n“But why?”\n\n“Life got tough.”\n\n“But that’s no reason to jump off a cliff. There’s always gonna be tough times. It’s like that penalty you couldn’t save. You were so upset, but then Mom said, ‘No pressure—”\n\n“—no diamonds,” I finished. “Yeah, I remember. But this isn’t a football game. Like I said, you’re too young to understand.”\n\n“Okay, but what about Mom? *She* had hard times, but *she* didn’t give up. And she got her diamond, right? She always wanted a cottage near the forest. Don’t you think she ever felt sad? Maybe she even thought about doing something stupid. But she didn’t. What would she say if she saw this?”\n\n“It doesn’t matter what she’d say. She’s gone.”\n\n“No she isn’t.”\n\n“She is. You saw it yourself.”\n\n“But if you can still see her in here,” he pointed at the pond, “and feel her in here,” he tapped his heart, “then she’s not *really* gone. Is she?”\n\n“Okay, technically not.”\n\n“And what you’re going through is no worse than she did, is it?”\n\n“Well, no. But—”\n\n“And *she* turned things around. So you could have done the same, right?” He stood. “Right?”\n\n“Maybe.”\n\n“Maybe?” he repeated, outraged.\n\n“Alright…yes.”\n\n“So why didn’t you?” \n\n“Because—\"\n\n“Why throw it all away, huh?” He pushed me.\n\n“I—\"\n\n“WHY?” Another push, more forceful this time. \n\n“BECAUSE I WAS SCARED, OKAY?”\n\nHe slid to the ground, head turned away hiding the tears.\n\nMy hand dropped onto his shoulder, a reassuring gesture. “Look, I’m sorry, but it was too much. I couldn’t take losing the people I loved anymore. When Mom died, it felt like...like all joy seeped out of the world.”\n\nWithout looking up, he said, “But what about the diamonds? For all you know, there were more good times ahead. And you threw them away.”\n\n“Yeah. I guess I did.”\n\n“But it’s not too late to fix things, right?” he lifted his gaze. “You could still turn it around? You’ve got time. I mean, you’re not *that* old.”\n\nAs I gazed into the black pond, registered the surrounding darkness, it occurred to me this may have been another realm. Who knows, perhaps I’d washed up in limbo. “I think it *is* too late, kid.”\n\n“Are you sure?”\n\n“The memories ended with the fall, remember?”\n\n“Let’s try again. Maybe there’s more,” he said, hunching over the pond.\n\n“I—”\n\n“It’s the least you could do.” He dragged me forward by the arm. \n\nWith a weary sigh, I let him steer our hands into the water, again.\n\nMore blobs took shape. I thought these were the same from earlier, until I saw myself standing outside Ciara and I’s apartment, tulips in hand. She pulled me in for a tight hug before I’d even finished uttering the words, “I’m sorry.”\n\nThe kid and I exchanged a glance. \n\nThere lay Ciara horizontal across the sofa, belly all swollen, while I built a crib. After bashing my thumb with the hammer, I yelled and jumped around the room while she roared with laughter.\n\nThe images gathered speed. “Wait, I can’t make out what’s happening.” \n\nThere was a baby, I think. Along with a brown puppy biting my shoelaces. Then I was pushing a girl with my mother's blue eyes along on a bike, teaching her to ride. \n\nIn a desperate attempt at delaying the flow, I tried scooping some future predictions up, unsuccessfully. \n\nI shook my younger self by the shoulders. “It’s going too fast. How do I slow it down?” \n\n“You can’t.”\n\nBy the time I looked from him to the pond, the reflections had dissolved once again. \n\n“Looks like things aren’t over yet.”\n\nI sat back, breathless. “I think you’re right. I think I made a huge mistake.”\n\nThe whole event felt like a moment of cosmic significance—like a wake-up call from the universe. Was this child-me some sort of guide? An angel sent to rekindle my zest for life? \n\nNo, not an angel. A pixie.\n\n“So, what would you do now?” he asked. “If you had another chance?” \n\nI stood patting my jeans. “I’d get off this crummy rock and apologize to Ciara.”\n\n“And live your life and be happy?”\n\n“Definitely.”\n\n“Promise?” he got up and held out his hand.\n\n“Promise.” We shook on it, hope surging in the pit of my stomach.\n\n“Well…that’s a shame,” he said, his voice all flat. “You had a really bright future ahead of you.”\n\n“Huh?” My hand released his as a wicked titter burst from his lips. \n\n“I’ve got bad news mister—this *isn’t* a dream. Or the afterlife.”\n\nChills went racing throughout my entire body. Somebody walked over my grave, Mom would say. “I don’t understand.”\n\nHe stepped forward. “Well see, you sat on our throne.” Black blobs spread out from his pupils like ink blots. “And as if *that* wasn’t bad enough, you even peed on it.” His lips twisted into a snarl, brackish liquid oozing from his mouth and nostrils. “And we can’t forgive that. Ever.” Up close, his rancid breath blasted me in the face, disgustingly warm. “So now…you're coming to be our plaything.”\n\nWith that, he opened his mouth and hissed fury. That voice stabbed my ears and made the fire wick out, plunging the world into complete darkness, except for the sparkles above. I scrambled away in reverse, pulse suddenly up between my ears, until my heel hit the log and sent me toppling backward.\n\nMy former companion vaulted over the trunk, his skin now alabaster white, ears sharp and pointed. In the centre of those black eyes, white dots sparkled. A snapping twig drew my attention toward the throne, where more sparkles weaved throughout the branches, each fixated on me.\n\nThe stories were true. The Pixies were real. And I’d angered them.\n\nIn a single breath, I scrambled to my feet and sprinted in the direction of the stairway. Behind me countless footsteps trampled through dirt and fallen leaves.\n\nOver my shoulder, I glimpsed sparkles overrunning the islet like a termite hill. I needed to get off that damn rock, fast.\n\nThe muddy bank flew beneath my feet. I charged through the Lough until it became deep enough to hurl myself forward and then the water hit like an ice bath. I kicked as fast and as hard as I could, limbs already numb.\n\nWaves rolled toward me as those creatures sped past my sides, slicing through the water in great soaring arcs. They veered back and forth creating powerful ripples which slammed against my chest and tossed me around, again and again. Was this all a game to them?\n\nThe coast appeared before me, fifty yards ahead. Maybe if I just kept kicking…\n\nDespite the Lough hurling me in every direction, I never stopped driving forward, even when foam blinded me, or drilled deep into my lungs. Soon I could make out a pebble beach. Almost there.\n\nA pale hand capped by curved black nails clamped tight around my ankle, then the water swallowed me with a resonant plop. Barely visible against the murk, there was a vague suggestion of a face below me, the same face that stared back at me in the mirror twenty years earlier, except for the black eyes punctuated by glowing pupils. \n\nSharp fingers plunged into my flesh, disappearing up to the first knuckle. When I tried to scream, bubbles spewed from my mouth. The hand reeled me down, deeper and deeper.\n\nHungry for air, I jabbed my booted foot into the nymph’s face. It swatted me with its free arm while I thrashed and kicked and stomped. As those curved fingers slid down my ankle, the flesh raked open.\n\nAbove me, rippling moonlight shrank, dimmed. It was now or never.\n\nSummoning every ounce of strength I had, I drove my boot into the imp’s skull. Finally, it released me. \n\nI gritted my teeth and swam for the surface. Just a few. More. Strides.\n\nBut then, for the second time that night, darkness pressed tight against me. And as the shadows took hold, my final thought was: so this is what drowning feels like…\n\n\\-\n\n“Easy, buddy. I’ve got you.”\n\nI gasped wildly for air, lips sputtering.\n\nAs the world slid into focus, I tried sitting up, but a hand forced me back down across a stony beach. My eyes rotated toward a paramedic, who’d been performing chest compressions moments earlier. \n\n“Easy,” he said, while I vomited up the remaining fluid in my lungs. Close by, ambulance lights flashed.\n\nMy saviour rubbed my arms, smiled. “Everything’s gonna be alright.”\n\nI craned my neck and looked down at a second paramedic wrapping my ankle—which kept gushing thick, dark blood—in a bandage. You could see bone through the wound.\n\nIt was real. It was all real.\n\nDeep in the pit of my stomach, excitement bubbled away. Excitement for the future. For what lay ahead. Oh sure, my body ached, my ankle burned, and it felt like a grenade exploded inside my skull. Yet despite all this, I felt better than I had in years.\n\nI looked up at the stars twinkling overhead, a smile creeping across my face.\n\n[Then I took a deep breath, and started laughing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)",

        "text": "I've always been into the paranormal. From stories to movies, video games, and even investigating the existence of ghosts and such. I haven't had the best success regarding that, but I didn't stop trying. I've tried many games and rituals and I found them all very interesting and unique, but I didn't expect any of them to actually work. Until one did, and it was the darkest and most traumatic experience of my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year, I stumbled upon an old VHS tape in the attic while searching for one of my old books for college. I have been staying with my grandma for 3 years since I moved out of my hometown. I figured my life would require much less financial needs that way, and my school was a bus away anyway. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgatha was sweet and generous, but for the most part, she was very austere. I rarely saw her because my mother didn't exactly want me to, and my dad was not a big fan of her either. I have vague memories of her in my childhood here and then. I remember her wide smile when she handed me those warm and delicious cookies, but apart from that, nothing else worth mentioning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike any other granny house, hers had a VHS player right under the TV, which I always thought didn't work, so I didn't bother caring for it until I found that tape. It was a dusty classic black tape, and on it was a piece of paper that said \"SOMNIA VERA 3\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't put much thought into it, so I grabbed it, planning to watch it some night she wasn't in the house. Fortunately, the following weekend my parents called her, asking her to fetch some of my old stuff back to my hometown. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI placed the VHS tape inside the player and sat down. The TV turned on, showing a black-and-white environment of bad quality, and two girls on two swings, giggling with each other. Then, it became very dark, and the two girls started walking toward what seemed like a dense forest, holding hands. After 1 minute of showing them walking, a short black figure with a hat that looked like a granny emerged out of nowhere and made very strange, incomprehensible noises that sounded like they ended with the tone of that of a question.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe girls nodded their heads, and the screen went black. After two seconds, it turned on again, this time showing the girls sleeping in their beds. The TV turned black once again and reopened immediately after. I was creeped out waiting for a jumpscare or something, but then it showed the two girls laughing and screaming hysterically as they were flying in that same room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir bodies were floating and were completely above the ground. A deep muffled voice was then heard, speaking in a language I couldn't possibly understand, and then the video ended. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was so confused after that. I spent the whole night before I slept thinking why would my grandma hide such a disturbing tape in the attic and why she hadn't talked to me about it. It didn't make any sense. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith a feeling of a big sack full of thoughts falling on my head, I drifted into sleep. I clearly remember the dream I had that night. It was about my ex-girlfriend and I making up after our long, ever-lasting fight, and...well doing some other stuff. It was so random, in reality, she wouldn't lay a finger on me. Not after we broke up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLittle did I know, the following morning at school, she greeted me with a huge smile and hugged me so tight, I almost felt asphyxiated. \"Uh...what's up Liz?\" I asked her, awkwardly waiting for an answer. \"Look, things have not been on our side lately...want to talk after school?\" she told me. I was shocked. I would not expect her to come up to me at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough we hadn't ended well, I thought that I could give us a second chance. After all, I really loved her. Later that day, we were hanging out and she invited me over to her house to watch a movie, and I'm sure you can figure out how that ended.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter arriving home, I was filled with the hunger to find answers again. How could it be? How could my dream come true that easily? There must be a reason behind it. I thought of that tape and the video. Did that have something to do with it? At that moment, I had a brief flashback of the two girls flying into their room. And that figure... What was the point of the video? It didn't add up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs happy as I was being with Liza again, I was just as baffled by that tape. I took a shower and collapsed on my bed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had another beautiful dream. This time, I dreamed of finally finding a decent job I was so desperately looking for. I can't quite recall what job it was but I was feeling happy. Like I was complete. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up at 9 am. I was late for school. I quickly changed, took a sip or two of an unfinished coffee sitting on the counter, and took the bus. I turned on my phone and scrolled through the majority of ads for jobs I had applied for, hoping to get accepted somewhere. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was right there. Top left corner. A message in the app from a guy named John saying I could come by his office for an interview the day tomorrow to discuss my possible position as a waiter at a cafe. I couldn't believe it. How was that happening? How were my dreams constantly coming true?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat same night I went to bed excited about my next dream. What would I want next? Better grades? another house? The possibilities were infinite. I dumped my body onto the bed and a feeling of relief ran through my body.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the morning, I woke up to noises coming from the kitchen. It sounded like glasses and pots. \"Hello?\" I shouted with a questioning voice. \"Well well well...look who's finally woken up\". It was my grandma doing the dishes. I completely forgot she would be home so soon. I checked the time and my heart skipped a beat when I saw it was 12 am. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI totally missed school. With a feeling of desperation and vagueness, I tried to collect my memory. I tried to remember what I had dreamed of. Nothing. I couldn't remember a single thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, a feeling of dredge and helplessness took over my body. My feet were paralyzed and I couldn't move. The thought of not knowing what I dreamed scared the life out of me. As I was standing there, looking at my grandma, my vision became blurry and I ultimately passed out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up in a hospital with my grandma, my friends, and my dad all sobbing and crying. \"What happened? What is going on?\" I said. I started hyperventilating and then a doctor came and sat next to me. \"Chris...I'm so sorry...your grandmother was informed earlier in the morning that your mother had died in a terrible car accident\". It couldn't be. I couldn't believe it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt turned out that my mother took a detour while she was driving, going to work, because of traffic, which led to her colliding with another vehicle. She was dead. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still have not yet recovered from this. It's been a year. I'm starting to believe my grandma knew all along and didn't tell me on purpose. I couldn't sleep the following days. The good news is that no more rapid changes in my life have occurred since then. I am still together with Liza and I got the job at the cafe. I have plans of leaving the house very soon. I can't stand living with Agatha anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeedless to say, the moment I got out of that hospital, I burned the tape and kicked the paranormal out of my life. No one knows about this and I'm not planning to share this story of mine anywhere else except here. To whoever may read this, be careful of what you watch and what you dream.",

        "text": "Everyone had been talking about the news. Pastor Jude had come out and said it. He said he spoke to God, and God told him that right here, in our little town, the antichrist was among us. Everybody knew everybody in my town; which meant everyone was suspicious of everyone.\n\nThat was when kids started avoiding me. They stopped sitting next to me in Sunday School, or playing hopscotch with me after church. Even my own brother avoided me. He would only say what he normally told me. He was the favourite because mom and dad only wanted boys. He even said if he had a daughter he would damn her to hell. I didn't know why everyone ignored me. Well, everybody except for Micah. He was the only kid in town who didn't avoid me.\n\nOne day, in Sunday school, as our teacher was babbling on and on about something or other, I was mindlessly doodling in my book as Micah sat next to me.\n\n\"Claudia,\" He whispered, nudging my elbow. \"Psst. Clauds, cut it out. Stop drawing that creepy stuff.\" I ignored him, until Elder Greene was stopped in front of me.\n\n\"Claudia,\" He said in a warning tone. I switched the pencil to my right hand, like I was always told to do. \"No, no, not that. What's that you're drawing?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing much really, Elder Greene. I was just doodling.\"\n\n\"Is that so, Ms. Keller? Well, let's see what this is, then.\" He picked up my book, and I gasped along with the rest of my class. Did I really draw that?\n\nAs I stared at my drawing, the pointed devil horns and sharp red eyes staring back at me, I couldn't help but think one thought. *I am a really good artist.*\n\nMicah scooched his seat away from me a bit.\n\n\"Ms. Keller, I'm afraid you can't join us if you draw satanic runes like this.\" Elder Greene said, just as Pastor Jude walked into our classroom.\n\n\"Now what's this, little Claudia?\" He asked, placing his hands on my shoulders.\n\n\"Nothing, Pastor-\"\n\n\"This one here has been drawing satanic imagery in her book, Pastor Jude. It's really quite concerning.\" Elder Greene interrupted.\n\n\"Elder, you mustn't interrupt Claudia like that. Come with me, dear.\" He took my wrist, and led me out of class. We sat down in the spare room, the one with no windows and a lock on the door. None of the other doors have locks on them.\n\n\"Was I really bad, father?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, no, my Claudia.\" He placed his hand on my leg, and tightened his grip when I tried to move away. \"But remember, demons go after those who are weak in faith, the ones who have fought the hardest battles.\"\n\n\"The demons go after those who have fought the hardest battles? Are they protecting them, father?\"\n\n\"No, no, my Claudia. Demons do not protect. Angels protect. Demons are horrible creatures, they feed off those who cannot fight back.\"\n\n\"But how do I know who is a demon and who is an angel, father?\" Pastor Jude brushed his fingers through my hair.\n\n\"Well, my Claudia, we-\"\n\nJust then, Micah knocked on the door.\n\n\"Claudia? Claudia? CLAUDIAAA-\" He started before Pastor Jude reluctantly got up and opened the door. He was holding a small chocolate egg in his hands.\n\n\"Sunday school ended. They were giving out chocolate eggs and I saved you one. It got a little melty, though.\" He reached his hand out to me, offering the melted chocolate that had been nearly liquified in his sweaty little palms.\n\n\"No thanks.\" I said.\n\n\"Well.\" Micah said, licking the chocolate off his hands. \"Ready to walk home? My ma said I can walk home all by myself as long as I go with you. We can go to the playground on the way!\"\n\n\"Okay. I have to go now, father. Goodbye.\"\n\nAs I left to walk home with Micah, Pastor Jude grabbed my hand.\n\n\"Goodbye, my Claudia.\" He said, kissing my hand. I pulled it away and hurried to catch up with Micah.\n\nAs we walked to his house, we talked.\n\n\"Do you really think there's an antichrist in this town?\" He asked. \"What even is an antichrist, anyway?\"\n\n\"It's someone who does the opposite of what God wants.\"\n\n\"Oh. Who is it, then?\n\n\"I don't know. Maybe it's me. That's why everyone's ignoring me.\"\n\n\"I don't think you're an antichrist. You're only nine.\"\n\n\"I'm a whole four months older than you. Plus, I'll be ten in a week. April 3rd.\"\n\nMicah shrugged. Just then, we heard a dreaded sound. The sound of Steven Shepard's old pickup truck. Steven Shepard was the meanest teenager in town, who loved to pick on kids. Especially me and Micah.\n\n\"Ooh, look who it is!\" He mocked, stepping out of his truck. \"Wittle Micah with his wittle girlfriend!\"\n\n\"Shut up, Steven.\" Micah said. Steven picked him up with one hand and threw him to the ground. He tried to get back up, but Steven stepped on his face with his big dirty boots.\n\n\"And what're you gonna do about it, little girl?\" He asked, as Micah tried to fight him off. He kicked Micah square in the mouth, making one of his teeth fall out. Then, he pushed me to the ground. He sat on top of me and pulled a pocket knife out of his jeans as I flew my arms in the air.\n\n\"Stop it, stop it, stop it, STOP!\" I screamed, a sudden volt of energy soaring through me. Suddenly Steven was flung back like a ragdoll. I didn't know what happened. I was just so angry.\n\n\"Aw. fuck, man.\" He said, trying to get up. \"I- yo, what the fuck is this?\" He took off dirt stained white tank top to reveal three big scratch marks on his back.\n\n\"The rumours are right!\" He screamed. \"You're the antichrist!\" He ran away, and I helped Micah up as he wiped blood off his face.\n\n\"Woah.\" He said. \"How'd you do that?\"\n\nThat night, as I brushed my teeth, I stared into the mirror. \n\n*The rumours are right! You're the antichrist!*\n\nCould it be true? Was that why Pastor Jude always paid more attention to me? Because he was scared of me? \n\nJust then, as I looked at my reflection, I noticed a figure standing just behind me. The lights were off, so I couldn't make it out, but I knew what it was. It towered over me, staring at me through it's gaunt, sunken eyes, it's pale and bony hands resting on my shoulder. I looked behind me. Nothing. I looked into the mirror and there it was. But I wasn't scared.\n\n*Demons do not protect.* Echoed through my head, but I ignored it. \n\nIt inched closer towards me, and reached it's hand out of the mirror for me to take. I reached back, but as soon as I touched it, there was a sudden jolt of energy, and it was gone. \n\nEven as I slept, I couldn't get the imagery out of my mind. I had seen hell, and I wasn't afraid. Who really knew the difference between angels and demons, anyway? Where was the line between them? Pastor Jude didn't know. Elder Greene didn't know. Nobody knew. But I knew one thing for sure.\n\nI was the antichrist. \n\nThe next morning, I woke up in the back of my parent's car. My younger brother sat next to me, but he didn't look at me. \n\n\"Where are we going, mom?\" I asked.\n\n\"To church, sweetheart.\" \n\n\"Church? But it's Monday.\" \n\n\"I know. We have something else for you in store today.\" \n\nAs we left the car, I noticed all the other townspeople staring at us. Some pulled their children away from me, others pointed and whispered to each other. I saw Micah, racing towards us on his bike.\n\n\"Claudia! Claudia! What are you guys doing!\" I tried to turn to talk to him, but my parents pulled me away and carried me into church.\n\n\"The Keller family!\" Pastor Jude said in a calm voice as we walked into the church. \"I'm glad you got my message so quickly, Mr. Keller. Now my Claudia, will you come with me?\" \n\nI took his hand, even though I didn't want to. He took me into the room with no windows and a lock on the door. \n\n\"Father, am I the antichrist?\" I asked as soon as we were alone.\n\n\"I-I don't know how to answer that, my Claudia.\" He said. \"I always told you those weak in faith would be the first preyed upon by demons. You must have faith in the Heavenly Father, my Claudia. I'm afraid  you must be in this room by yourself for some time. Solitude is when we are best connected to God.\" \n\n\"Please no, father. I'm afraid of this room, I don't want to be alone!\" \n\n\"You must be alone, my Claudia. I'm sorry.\" He said, and kissed me on the cheek. \n\nAs he removed the door handles so I couldn't leave, I pounded on the door. I sobbed as the lights all dimmed, leaving me in total darkness. I tried to pray to the heavenly father to let me out.\n\n*I am the antichrist.* I thought. If I really was the antichrist, why would He listen to my prayers? \n\nHours must've passed. I had no idea how long I really was in there, I had no way to tell the time. I was so afraid and lost. Why was everyone scared of me? Why did I have to be born the antichrist? I didn't do anything. \n\nSuddenly, I heard voices outside of the room. Pastor Jude's. \n\n\"This child is the antichrist! She will be the end of our town, the country, the world even! Do we just sit back and take it? It is in God's will to do anything to protect his children, and I say this child is only going to harm you! I say we kill the child, in the name of God!\" He said, and I heard cheers and applause. \n\n\"How?\" A voice asked. Elder Greene's. \n\n\"She's locked in a room, currently. If we burn the church down, she'll be trapped inside, and we'll be rid of the horrible sins that have been burdened upon this town!\" Pastor Jude said, and I heard more cheers. \"Well, what are we waiting for? Grab your torches, your pitchforks, whatever. Just be rid of the child.\" \n\nI wasn't sad any longer. I was filled with rage. They wanted to kill me? As the smell of smoke filled the air, I only got angrier. Then, I saw it.\n\nThe thing from the mirror. The demon with gaunt, pale skin, with sunken eyes and bony fingers. But this time it was right in front of me. I knew what he wanted me to do. In a fit of rage, I screamed, and the demon stood behind me. I reached my hand out, and the door blew off the handles. I didn't care if it made me demonic. I was too mad. I walked through the flaming building, and I wasn't hurt. But then I heard a familiar voice. Micah.\n\nI rushed to the closest window, and saw him on his bike on the sidewalk across from the church\n\n\"Claudia! Claudia, come here! I'll help you!\" He started pedaling across the street, when Pastor Jude appeared in front of him.\n\n\"Go, boy. Leave.\" He said.\n\n\"NO!\" Micah yelled. \"I have to help Claudia!\" He tried to push past Pastor Jude, but he picked Micah up with one hand. With what looked like no effort, he threw him into the street. I tried to warn Micah from the truck that was coming his way, but I was too late. It ran over him, splattering Pastor Jude with blood. \n\n\"Micah!\" I yelled, which got Pastor Jude's attention.\n\n\"You! How did you get out?\" He said, and started to run towards the church. I ran down the burning hallway as I heard his footsteps beside me. He chased me up the stairs of the bell chapel, the only part of the church that wasn't in flames. We finally met, face to face, his once clean and pressed suit dirty and bloodstained. \n\n\"It's over now, demon child. Accept your fate.\" He said as the flames climbed up the stairs. He drew out a knife and approached me, when both of us snapped our heads around. There was a noise. \n\nSuddenly, I saw the demon who had been following me around. His head was bowed down to a figure beside him. I looked up, and saw the same horns and eyes as in my picture. The Angel of Death himself. Satan.\n\nPastor Jude looked scared. \"Y-your satanic majesty! T-this child, she is the antichrist! You must take her away and punish her.\"\n\nThe devil scoffed. \"I am aware of who Claudia Keller is. I sent my best demon out to protect her.\"\n\n\"P-protect? Demons do not protect.\"\n\nHe laughed a booming, loud laugh. \"You really think? Demons protect those who need protection from evil. Angels don't do shit. They just sit in the sky all day and play their harps.\" The demon beside him wheezed, what I assumed was a laugh. \"But you're right about there being the antichrist in this town. I've come to punish them.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Pastor Jude said. \"So you'll take her away?\" He pointed to me.\n\nSatan grabbed him by his white collar. \"You really think, after everything I've told you, that Claudia Keller is the antichrist? You mortals really are stupid.\" \n\n\"S-so... Claudia isn't the antichrist?\"\n\n\"Of course she isn't the antichrist. She never was. You are.\" He said and snapped his fingers. The demon beside him grabbed Pastor Jude and opened what looked like a portal in the ground. They both fell through it, and I heard Pastor Jude's screams all the way around.\n\n\"Well.\" Satan said. \"Now I can go tell God that's taken care of.\" He looked to me. \"Now, my Claudia. I made a promise to God.\"\n\n\"Wait, you talk to him?\" I asked.\n\nSatan shrugged. \"You mortals have a funny way of spinning things. We are more coworkers than anything. Well. I promised I would protect those who were mistreated by his children. These townspeople, they will never understand you. Things will only get worse. If you want to join me, my Claudia, you are welcome to. I have a special job for you, in my kingdom. What do you say?\"\n\nHe stretched his hand out for me to take, and I thought about it. The people of this town thought I was the antichrist. They killed my best friend. They locked me in rooms with no windows and a lock on the door. But, what this the right choice? If I chose to be with the demon, wouldn't that only be proving their points?\n\nBut as I took Satan's mighty, giant hand in mine, I knew I had made the right choice. I was going home.",

        "text": "My beloved grandmother died. I was delirious with grief until I heard a “night crying” song again. It jolted me like an electric shock, pulling me out of my half-awake state. My brain cells followed the melody and a realization began to brew. \n\nGrandma was very health conscious. She studied nutrition, kept exercising, and even dived into some supernatural things to live long. \n\n\"I don't want to leave you. I don't want to miss every moment of you.\" Grandma said to me.\n\nAbout a month ago, grandma accidentally broke her arm and was hospitalized. Fortunately, she recovered quickly. One night, I came to visit her with some fruit, about to put down these things, and went to work. I was a salesperson in a 24-hour convenience store with duty on the night shift that day with a girl, Nana.\n\nA short distance away from the inpatient building where my grandmother stayed, I heard a faint sound. Like crying, like singing. Walking forward, the voice became clearer.\n\n\"Night Crying,\" I thought. \"Someone died.\"\n\nI must explain to you what \"Night Crying\" is. It's a tradition in our town. It is said that after a person dies, his ghost doesn’t leave and just wanders around the world because there are things hard to let go. They could be something unfinished or someone continually loved. To make the ghost release the past and go to his destination (I don’t know where it is), his family will invite a specialist to make a night crying rite. The guy will sing a song of nostalgia and exhortation in a deeply mournful tone, looking back at the past, and advising the ghost to get over the death fact and move on.\n\nAlthough I've never actually heard night crying, I guessed it's just that. \n\nLouder and louder with my approaching. I saw a woman in black clothes. She was facing me, waving her hands and shaking her head, sometimes leaning down, looking up. It was kind of scary, so I quickened my pace and walked close to the wall, wishing I could hide in the gap in the wall.\n\nThe song sometimes was a low murmur. It was like hundreds of leather drums beating together, and the dull voice contains huge energy. Sometimes it was a heart-piercing scream. The emotion was so intense that I couldn't tell whether it is sadness or anger. Even though I tried very hard to avoid understanding the lyrics, there was one line catching my attention.\n\n“Death comes with a crawl. Death comes with a pounce. It doesn’t matter how you die. Make your death count in a while.”\n\nOuch. I ran as hard as I could, as if the ground under my feet was no longer a solid road, but flying cloth, flowing water, things that could not bear any weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally entered the building. The walls largely cut off part of the song, but the faint voice still floated in the air. The nurse at the front desk saw me coming in and smiled at me. My heart felt more at ease.\n\n\"Did someone die?\" I asked.\n\n\"Every moment. Here is the hospital.\"\n\nI just ended the conversation and went back to Granny's room. I opened the door. grandma was lying on her side facing the window. It was open, and the light poured directly onto the bed. \n\nShe turned over, and said, \"You back.\"\n\n\"Why haven't you slept yet? It's late.\"\n\n\" I can't sleep until you're back\"\n\n\"Did the sound outside bother you?\"\n\n\"Sound?\"\n\nThen I told her what I saw and heard.\n\n“It doesn’t matter how you die. Make your death count in a while.” I repeated.\n\nHer face turned uneasy. The air suddenly froze, only the annoying singing floating in the sky.\n\n\"Is it all right?\"\n\n\"Terrible. Sounds like a calling.\"\n\nShe was always afraid of death and refused any death news. \n\n\"It's okay. It's none of our business.\" I caressed her grey hair, trying to convey strength and support through touch.\n\n\"You have better sleep now and I'll come to see you when you wake up.\"\n\n\"Where are you going?\" \n\n\"Work. I'm on the night shift tonight.\"\n\nShe closed her eyes, different from the usual, the chest upping and downing kind of violently.\n\n\"Don’t go.\"\n\n\"Ah?\"\n\n\"Stay. I'm afraid.\"\n\nHer cloudy eyes suddenly burst into tears, which scared me.\n\n\"Okay, okay. Don't cry. I'm not leaving. \"\n\nAfter appeasing her, I gave Nana a call.\n\n\"Nana, my grandma is not feeling well and I have asked Arthur (the manager) for a leave tonight.\"\n\n\"Sorry to hear that and hope your grandma gets better soon. Oh God Damn.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Oh, sorry not about you. My ex keeps calling in and I'm so sick of it.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh. Anyway, thank you.\"\n\nGrandma and I slept together. She held me in her arms, which was what she did to me when I was a child. She put one hand on my shoulder and patted it gently. The moonlight outside just shone in, and the walls reflected a gloomy blue light. Under such circumstances, everything became soft and the noise outside was also getting further and further away. \n\nI was tired and my consciousness was to blur. But grandma was whispering, holding my hand.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" she muttered.\n\nA phone call woke me up in the morning. Arthur asked me to go back to the store.\n\n\"Just go,\" Grandma said with a weak smile.\n\nI kissed her on the cheek, meanwhile feeling an unnatural heat radiating from her skin.\n\n“Nanny, you are hot. Are you ok?”\n\n“The body temperature rises in the morning. And you should go.”\n\n\"I'll be back soon.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was shocked by what I saw. A cordon surrounds the store. There stood several police officers.\n\nThe building’s outer wall was burnt to blackness, and the inside was messy. Arthur was walking to me. \n\n\"What happened?\" \n\n\"Terrible. It got fired last night.\"\n\n\"Where is Nana?\"\n\nArthur held his head, choked up, and said, \"She, she was burned to death. Her damn ex-boyfriend murdered her. Held the door and burned her alive.\"\n\nMy mind went blank.\n\nWhen I was still in a mess, a call came in.\n\n\"This is Francis Hospital. I am sorry to inform you that your grandmother is not well.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSevere muscular dehydration. It usually occurs at high temperatures. But that was how my nanny died. I can't figure out why these things happened.\n\nOn the seventh day of grandma's death, uncle Jay invited a man to do the “night crying” for grandma. But his song was completely different from the last time I heard it.\n\n“I once heard a night crying song. That is Death comes with a crawl. Death comes with a pounce. It doesn’t matter how you die. Make your death count in a while.”\n\n“Honestly, it is not night crying songs.” The man said.\n\nAn indescribable madness brought me to that thought. \n\nIt's me. The one who should die is me. I would have turned up at the convenience store that night and been burned with Nana.\n\n“Oh my god, it was a deal with death. How could you do that to me?” I was on my knees crying.\n\n“Your grandma is leaving, without any regrets.” The man tapped my shoulder gently.\n\n“I love you, babe.”\n\nI can never be mistaken. This gentle touch belongs to my grandma!",
