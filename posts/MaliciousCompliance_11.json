        "text": "Hi redit before I begin this story I just want to say I’m a 17 year old male and I’m dyslexic so sorry for any spelling mistakes. So I work for a well known fast food restaurant, where I work in the kitchen. So today I had to call in sick after throwing up, you know what you normally do. But my manager doesn’t believe that I’m sick. Keep in mind I’ve had problems with my manager in the past. So anyway she tells me to come in because we’re low on staff. This is we’re the malicious complaints comes in so I weekly get out of bed and get my uniform on get dropped off at work and start my shift. At this point my manager is having a go at me saying I was trying to fake being ill.I’ve had enough from this point, so what do I do welst I’m making an order it starts coming out, there’s vomit everywhere. My manager then comes over and sends me home but before I do she gets covered in sick. So as I’m writing this I’m in bed and with a sick bucket and my dog and my main manager on the phone explaining what’s happening. I’ll keep you all updated. Sorry for the format I’m terrible at structure but it’s even worse when I’m ill",

        "text": "I currently work at a Mexican chain in Australia. A few months back, we had this really bad manager who was doing a placement at our store while her store was undergoing repairs from flooding. She’s the type of person who looks down on you because you’re a worker and she’s a manager. \n\nWhen I first started, I did an opening shift with her. I hadn’t done one before, and I kept asking questions which she kept getting annoyed at and kept acting like I should know what I was doing and kept leaving me alone. She belittled me for not getting the meats out ‘on time’, AKA, two minutes past opening. She yelled at me because I didn’t put coriander in our salsa when we were out of coriander. She yelled at me for putting too many beans on one burrito despite me following the build guide. She had been yelling at me and treating me really badly all day to the point I’d almost walked out and left her, but I kept my cool\n\nNow I’d like to add, it’s well known in the store that I have hip dysplasia which in turn really hurts my lower back, so I have to sit down for a few minutes and rest it, afterwards I’m usually fine. It’s on my file, and the store manager has always been fine with it as long as it’s not during a rush. That day was an especially bad day, so after around five hours on my feet, my back was really starting to ache, so I asked her if I could sit down for a few minutes to rest as the busy period had passed. \n\nManager: Why? Cant you just work?\n\nMe: I have hip dysplasia so I just need to sit for five minutes, [store manager] has always been fine with it.\n\nManager: That doesn’t even make any sense. No you can’t sit down.\n\nMe: I’m in a lot of pain, all I need is five minutes, I’ll come back out if it gets busy. \n\nManager: No, I don’t pay you to sit down. \nGo take your break instead (30 mins) and don’t come back until you’re done complaining. \n\nSo, I made myself some lunch, and sat down in our dining room. About five minutes later, the busiest rush of a lifetime came through the door. We were still a reasonably new store and the hype was high, so I’m talking a line going out the door and it kept growing. My manager’s face turned white as she started serving people who are ordering large amounts of food per person. She gave me these looks of distress asking for my help with her eyes. Cue, my malicious compliance. \n\nI sat back on my phone, looking as relaxed as humanly possible, taking very big and dramatic mouthfuls of my food while watching youtube very loudly. I had customers ask me if I could hop back behind the counter, but I simply said ‘I’m sorry. My manager sent me on my break and said not to come back until I’m done complaining about my back problems, and I’m still very sore.’ She stares daggers at me, but I just kept eating my lunch. Customers start getting angry at her for not moving fast enough to keep up with the demand, but she knows she can’t blame me because of what she said earlier, so she just keeps apologising. She was running around the back to get salads from the fridge, swapping meats around, getting new sauces, basically things that a second employee is meant to be there to help with, all while customers kept complaining. \n\nI just sat and watched, smirking as she clearly regretted not just letting me sit down for five minutes, otherwise i would’ve been there to help. when the rush finally ended about 40 minutes later, I clocked back on and said:\n\n‘Thanks for the extended break. My back feels so much better now’. Which incited many glares in my direction.\n\nI didn’t have to serve even one of the probably 40-50 customers that came through the door. She treated me better after that and is now always her kindest self when she’s around me, so I call that a win. Luckily, her store was repaired and she went back there. People said I was an a**hole for this, but I don’t care. Next week will be my final shift at that store, and I’m very thankful I’ll never have to be under her management again",

        "text": "I just graduated high school this year, but I want to talk about one of my favorite teachers. I will call him Mr.W. Mr.W was a fun but old-fashioned teacher. Mr.W taught us everything we needed to know and even had a deal with all his classes. Mr.W said he had never had a student who passed one of his tests by cheating. So his agreement l was if you got caught cheating, you got a zero on the test, and if you passed the test while cheating somehow, you would get half of what the test was worth. I had fixable grades, but he had one thing we were EXPECTED to memorize. We had to remember a specific list that I'd already forgotten. For the life of me, I couldn't remember this list. This list was a large part of every graded project we did. I had a D- in his class and had been studying for an upcoming final worth roughly 40% of our grade. I had a runny nose the day of the test and had a tissue box on me the whole day. At lunch, I was panicking and trying to memorize the list, and a devious idea dawned upon me. I would fail if I didn't cheat or have a 50/50 shot if I did. I took my risks and wrote the entire list down carefully on a tissue, then put it back in the box. I had his class after lunch, so when I took the final, I got my tissue cheat sheet and copied it as sneakily as possible. I blew my nose with it and threw it away. I got a 76% on my quiz, which brought me to about a C. I was so happy. I didn't think that Mr.W would keep his end of his deal, so I didn't tell him until the next nine weeks.  To my surprise, he gave me 36 points for managing to cheat in his classroom. He was always a great guy. Zero grudges occurred on either side however, he updated his policy to if a student gets away with cheating in his classroom he will only add 5 points to whatever they cheated on, and late confessions are no longer valid.",

        "text": "When I was younger about middle school 7th grade I think a kid who we’ll call Jim started bullying me. This bullying went on into 8th grade throughout 7th grade Jim and his group would steal from me,beat me relentlessly,and sometimes talk about my dead relatives. When I got to 8th grade a couple months in my uncle who was in the military passed away due to loss of blood after tripping a land mine during a battle. All I had of him was a dog tag so I starting wearing it every day. One day Jim and his friends saw the dog tag and thought they wanted it so like always they told me to give it to them or they would beat me after school. When I didn’t give it to them they got mad and told me to be ready for after school. It was the end of the day and I was getting ready for what was gonna happen after school. Before school ended I took off the dog tag to protect it. When they beat me I held the dog tag as tight as I could. All the stealing,beating,and getting made fun of went on until 9th grade I was now in high school. My mom took me into her room and said I was finally ready. She took out a knife that my uncle used and she gave it to. It was the weekend so I put the knife in my backpack to show my grandma. After the weekend was over i forgot to take the knife out of my backpack so I had it at school. That day I decided to wear the dog tag from my uncle again. When Jim and his friends saw it they said they were gonna steal it from me after school. When I was putting away my stuff I spotted the knife in my backpack without thinking about it I slipped it into my pocket on my way home when Jim and his friends showed up I said I didn’t want any trouble then Jim pushed me. After that I lost it. I tackled Jim took out the knife and started to slowly cut off his head. All of his friends were standing there screaming and what they were seeing. After I finished with Jim I sprinted over to pond to wash the blade and my hands. Luckily when I got home nobody was there so I had time to shower. After that I went to school as if it were a normal day except without Jim. His friends left me alone after what the saw me do. Nobody found out because I told his friends I would do the same to them if they told anyone.",

        "text": "All of this started last year. My english teacher Mr. J wasn't the best teacher; both teaching wise and in general. He would berate my entire class and always make mean remarks if someone ever did anything wrong. He would also lower our grades for no reason. Me and my class have been dealing with this since last year and nobody has dared to say anything because Mr. J is quite literally the principals older brother.\n\nThe final straw was when he recently lowered my grade from a 89 to a 38 for no reason. I have turned in all assignments and have gotten good marks on tests. I wasn't alone. All of my other classmates also got really low marks; the highest being a 67. So, I decided to launch a plan.\n\nI started gathering evidence of Mr J. being disrespectful, both to our class and even some teachers. After 2-3 months worth of recordings, I decided to do the smarter move and complain to the Assistant Superintendent of the school. Surprisingly, he took the situation seriously (not commonly seen by him).\n\nNow both the principal and the english teacher are livid at me. I have already been \"suspended\" for a week because I recorded them without their consent (The Assistant Superintendent ended up lifting my suspension once he found out).\n\nOn the last day of school before winter break (which was today), the Assistant Superintendent called me into his office. He explained to be that he can't do much until the Superintendent take this report seriously. When I asked him was we could do now, he said that he could suspend both the principal and Mr. J momentarily. He also said that he would fix our grades to the corresponding ones.\n\nNow I have to wait until the 11th of January for any more information. As of writing though, I was told by my mom that Mr J. has tried to call her and tell me to forget that everything happened and tell the Assistant Superintendent to do nothing about this case.   \n\n\nRight now though, all we can do is wait until then. I'll update you guys as soon as I can.",

        "text": "I'm an hourly employee in a professional-based business.  Certified, degreed, etc.  The point is this not a teenage fast-food type of business.  The nature of the position just happens to be hourly instead of salaried.  \n\nThe boss regularly sends OT offers to the staff.  This happened recently on an hour-long job I knew no one would likely want to work.  Taking this M-F \"one-off\" assignment would mean going in early.  And only being paid 30 minutes of OT pay because the remaining 30 minutes of the hour happens to be during regular \"on the clock\" time.  I responded saying I'd go in early, and cover the first 30 minutes IF the others on the team could each cover just one day of the week for the second 30 minutes.  Meaning, there are 5 others on the team, and if each took a day, they'd only have to support one day a week. I'd support 5 days a week.  \n\nTwo on the team said \"sure\" and picked they day they wanted.   One hasn't responded in any sort of way.  A fourth said they wouldn't because they have to work a specific assignment that's long been scheduled for the last 10 minutes of her day (regular time at the same time others are working).  One said the original request was for the hour so won't support it.\n\nTo stress the point further, those pushing back (to be fair, even those that took a single day) are regularly 30-45 minutes late to arrive at the business.  My original request was indirectly asking them to show up on-time one day a week and that seems at the root of the pushback, though that's a guess.  \n\nThe boss has been included on all of the replies and is unresponsive.  This boss tends to follow that MO, letting people/team fail without addressing accountability.  Boss is also off-site and there are no checks and balances, so anyone aware folks are coming in late/leaving early is not noticed.  Or if it is noticed, isn't corrected.  \n\nI regret ever trying to offer support in the first place.  The team is all sorts of dysfunctional, so this pushback feels like another example in a long history is questionable integrity as working employees. What are some options for next steps?  I don't want this to be a stress, but it is.  And I'm not okay with being paid the same working hours as someone who is on-site 4-5 hours a week less than me.",

        "text": "A bit of backstory, I M(20) have been working at this fast food place that is known for serving chicken for a bit over a year at the back of house. I have gotten pretty good at almost every station. But my specialty is on the fries station. I have been told by both supervisors in the front and back that I’m the best at the station. The supervisor (let’s call him Jake) that was running the shift just recently moved to the back with 3 months working in the kitchen after working in the front. We started \nworking here around the same time. \n\nSince it is almost Christmas, it tends to get busy. Lunch comes around and I was placed on fries which was no problem for me. Jake come to me and says to not fall behind which I say sure thing. He is working on the chicken fryer and at around 11 am it starts to get busy. I always like to keep my fries freezer stocked up so that I don’t run out and when I do need to stock up, I make sure that the fries chute is full (depending if it’s busy or slow) and grab the amount of boxes I need. This takes 30 seconds tops per trip. I have worked with this method for months now and within those months I never fell behind when restocking. When I was in the middle of restocking, I smashed my finger against the chicken thawing cabinet and I didn’t know if it was bleeding or not. So I finish restocking what I had and asked a fellow coworker that is buttering and toasting buns for the line if she can take fries for a bit while I checked on my finger (It wasn’t bleeding). When I came back my coworker was falling behind and I went in to help her. Then I hear my supervisor calling me so I go to him. \n\nJake: Why weren’t you at your station? \n\nMe: I was restocking my freezer but I smashed my finger so I asked my coworker to step in for a second while I checked it out. \n\nJake: we care falling behind on orders right now. I need you to be at your station and if you need fries I’ll get it for you. \n\nMe: I can see that we are really busy and I feel that it is better that I grab my own fries since I have been doing it like this for months and haven’t fallen behind. That way we don’t have to pull someone that’s already at their station to grab me fries. \n\nJake: I don’t care. Just go to your station and don’t leave or else I’m going to write you up. \n\nSo I go back to my station and caught up to the current orders. By the time the second rush came I was low on fries so I yell out to the person on the chicken fryer (Jake) that I needed 6 boxes of fries. So he goes and gets trolley and starts grabbing the fries boxes. When he got to the walk-in freezer the chicken fryers started to go off and Jake comes back to the fryers and puts the chicken to the line. I get to my last bag of fries and I yell out “I’m on my last bag” and I turn and see him trying to drop the chicken into the fryer, starting the fryer and power walk to the freezer. But one of the fryers goes off and needs to be cleaned. He cleans it and rushes to the freezer to get me the boxes that’s already on the trolley.\n\nJake: How do you feel if you just grab your own fries like you always do. \n\nMe: I was thinking the same thing. You got it Jake. \n\nSo we finish the rush. I can move around to help the person next to me when her bun person left for her break. And I can now grab my own fries again when I need it.",

        "text": "Firstly the obligatory excuse the formatting I am on my phone. \n\nSo I didn't inflict this malicious compliance, but I was on the receiving end. This happened mere minutes ago in a restaurant in South Africa. My fiancé and I decided to stop and get some dinner before heading to the Christmas lights.\n\nWe sat down ordered the food, I asked that they replace the creamy garlic sauce with a lemon butter sauce. All good so far. My fiancé and I started talking about the wedding, and all the plans we have.\n\nOur food came and instead of the lemon butter sauce, my food was covered with the creamy garlic sauce. When I asked the waitress what happened she first said she forgot, then she said that she thought I asked for it on the side, and then that the kitchen couldn't make lemon butter sauce.\n\nThe waitress then asked if she can take away my food and go and redo it, I asked again if I can get the lemon butter sauce and she repeated that the kitchen can't make it, but they will just scrape the creamy garlic sauce from my food. I told them to just leave it and I will eat my food as is.\n\nThe manager then came to ask what the issue was and I explained the situation, she asked if the can go and remake the food as the waitress was mistaken and they could give me the sauce I asked for. I protested but they insisted and took my half eaten plate away.\n\nNow here is the malicious compliance (or rather what we suspect happened). A whole new plate came with lots and lots of lemon butter sauce, I took my first faithful bite and BAM, my muscles contorted, my eyes scrunched close and my blood turned acidic. That sauce was more lemon than butter, I could have taken a shot of tequila with that sauce.\n\nMy fiancé started laughing at my face contorting in pure unadulterated lemony justice. My steak, my onion rings, my chips, my muscles and prawn were all covered in this. The kitchen probably went, oh so he wants lemon and butter sauce, fine, we will give him LEMON and butter sauce!\n\nI ate my food had a good laugh with the waitress and manager and now we are going walk down the street and look at the Christmas lights.\n\nMerry Christmas and a happy new year!",

        "text": "My commute to work got progressively longer and unpredictable over the past year due to 4 bridge closures occurring within months or weeks of each other. No date has been given for their reopening, so for the time being, short of heading off for work an hour or two ahead of time, you risk arriving a minute to 5 minutes late once or twice a week.\n\nEveryone has been impacted by the traffic in one way or another, which I mention because there was no way someone could feign ignorance.  One coworker, though, didn't care about legitimate reasons for my being slightly late for work every now and then, and complained so adamantly behind my back about it that my immediate supervisor reluctantly wrote me up.\n\nI knew it had to be that one coworker because they would get noticeably irritated whenever traffic conditions were brought up. They would leave the room, loudly interrupt with unimportant questions or comments, or roll their eyes.\n\nThey're also known for complaining about every little thing, at one point having played a big role in not having a seasonal employee rehired the following year.\n\nDespite that coworker, I love my job. So I started leaving for work an hour an a half earlier than before. My arrival time is now anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes before my shift starts.\n\nAnd that's when I noticed the annoying coworker always arrives about 10 minutes early and always has a very convenient street parking space available. I used to park on a different side of our building before traffic got bad, and had never noticed that they'd unofficially claimed that public parking spot as theirs.\n\nMost of the time, I'm at work early enough to get my pick of any spot in our always crowded employee parking lot, but no parking spot other than theirs makes up for my having to wake up at 530 in the morning.\n\nThat coworker can't complain about my being late now. They know better than anyone that I'm at work way before I have to. I've mentioned my arrival time to other coworkers with them in earshot, so they know I'm parking there out of spite. I've also gone as far as parking right in the middle of a space large enough to acomodate their car and mine.\n\nI have no idea if they've complained to our supervisor about it or not, but I really want them to have been stupid enough to complain about my taking their public parking spot away.",

        "text": "20 years ago I was working in a small pub and we had a great team with mostly awesome management until ‘Greg’ started. \n\nGreg wore garishly bright shirts, was a big mouth and was hired as a Supervisor. Money from tills started to go missing pretty much straight away. Concerns by all Staff were raised to our Licencee ‘Mike’ (top boss who answered directly to owner), but all for naught. \n\nI would always count my tills at the start and end of every shift so I knew mine would be slightly up (I threw my tips in during my shift and took them out at the end). Only one other staff member did this.\n\nDuring a staff meeting (held a month after Greg started) Mike told all staff that any till shortages would be taken from our pay. Staff were understandly NOT happy.\n\nShortly after, Mike told me my till was down $10 from the day prior. Okay, weird. I told Mike I counted it in front of Greg after my shift but accidents happen. \n\nAt this time I suspected everyone - including Mike.\n \n3 weeks later, Greg was working a Friday closing shift and was taking tills from 3 locations to the Office and was ‘mugged’. He said he was knocked out from behind - conveniently where there was no security or CC footage. 3 tills with all the days takings were stolen.\n\nThe following morning I was asked to come in on short notice (night staff member ‘Sam’ was unable to come in due to having to stay back previous night to speak with Police about the mugging and to close up). I went in the office to get, and count, my 3 tills beside Mike prior to starting.\n\nNow anyone who works with cash can pick up a bundle and instantly know it’s a bill short. First till I pick up a bundle of $20’s and it’s light. The rubber band is around this bundle and I say, “Mike, this bundles short”. Mike takes the rubber band off and it’s short 2 x $20 bills so $160 instead of $200 (10 bills per bundle). Next a $10 bundle, short a note. Both $5 bundles short a note each. All but one bundle on the 3 tills are short. Mike is perplexed so we go through every till in the safe, and every till is short. \nEvery till in the safe was prepared by the closing manager the night before - aka Greg, PRIOR to being mugged. \n\nSo I kept my mouth shut as I finally worked out it was Greg and how he was skimming - mainly BEFORE giving certain people their tills. See Sam and quite a few Staff never counted their tills at the start of their shifts - and would give me crap because I did.\n\nI had given my SO a gag gift - a recording pen. It took audio and really crappy video. So a few nights later Greg comes in while offduty to have a drink while I was working. I got him tipsy and pen recorded him, talking all sorts of crap. I’m constantly changing from subject to subject, leading in what I wanted to discuss - about how to get away with crimes. This pub was an old Police drinking pub and a few Cops still drank there regularly. One Cop realised what I was doing and played along, throwing in questions and comments too. Greg basically confessed his crimes ‘Yeah if it was me I’d blah blah blah’.\n\nSo early the next day I downloaded my pen footage, saved it to a DVD (😂) making note of the time Greg ‘confessed’. I gave a higher up Staff member a heads up on my plan of attack as they got along well with the owner. \n\nGreg was working night shift that night. It was a quiet night with only regulars (who were all aware of the goings on of missing cash). I’d asked most off duty staff to come in to have a ‘drink’. Mike joined us, the Cops were there enjoying their drinks. It was a fun night. \n\nAround 8pm, a bar staff member went on their break and Greg covered the bar we were all sitting at. With some help from another Supervisor, we managed to play this ‘confession’ over all the main TVs in the bar areas of the pub. The look on Greg’s face was priceless. Even with the crappy video, everyone could make out the bright lime green shirt with clear audio. Everyone - including the Cops and other regulars - just stared at Greg, who tried to talk his way out of it.\nOh and the owner happened to ‘drop in’ just before 8pm.\n\nGreg was arrested and word got out. He was evicted from his accommodation. Turns out he had a drug problem and Police found drugs at his house. A big sketchy guy came in to the pub looking for him not long after. More cameras were put in to cover all areas - including the office - and Mike left not long after.\nBye Greg 👋",

Yikes I know, but he was a broke college student driving a beat up truck he rebuilt himself. While there wasn’t any severe damage to her vehicle Karen decided that it wasn’t good enough and she was gonna sue him. This kid had literally nothing to his name except this truck. He lost the suit and his truck was to be repossessed due to it. He’s worked on cars his whole life so after finding this out he replaced the engine with non functional one from a junkyard car, took all the tires off and put it on cinder blocks. When they came to repo the car Karen showed up looking smug as hell only to see what he had done. He merely shrugged and said the tires were stolen and to enjoy his truck. It took them about two hours to get his truck as they had to get a different kind of tow truck. \n\nA month later he had a different truck with his old tiers and engine. He told me what happened and I asked if he insured this one and he said “no because there is no shortage of $500 trucks and seeing that lady’s reaction was priceless”",

The thing is, he has an abusive narcissistic mom, who thinks she can do no wrong and everything bad is her life is somehow my boyfriend's fault.\n\nThe thing is that she is also very stupid, and constatly forces my boyfriend to do things that goes against a regular person's common sense, that instantly backfires. My boyfriend if he wanted could write a post in this sub every week, but he doesn't know to write in english, so here I am.\n\nI was spending the weekend at his house, like I usually do. His mom's health these last months has been terrible because a bug bite her in the leg, she disn't recieve instant medical care because she was more focused on her work that her wellbeing, and the bite ended up rotting a hole into the flesh, so she now has to be forced to take propper medical care. This woman is so incompetent that is a danger to herself.\n\nAnyway, their car has been broken for many months, but my boyfriend finally managed to make it work again. I know nothing about cars, but is a Ford Fiesta from I think 2010 or older. His mom can't drive, so as soon as the car was working again, started to use my BF as her person taxi, just as we expected. She wants him to drive her to her work at 5 am, and sometimes also wants him to drive her back home, which is a pain because her workplace is far away in the middle of our city, but if he refuses, she throws a childish tantrum until he says \"Ok\". She literally get away with anything by throwing tantrums, even for stupid things. Once she was angered because BF forgot to clean a small corner, after he left the entire house perfectly clean.\n\nBack to the story. Friday in the afternoon, he picked me up at my workplace and we got to his house. We took a highway, when the car started to loose some power, until it shutdown itself. We ran out of gas. He was angry because everytime his mom made him waste so much gas that week. Tried to turn it on, and after some trying, he did it. Every few hundred meters the car would shutdown again, and we had to turn it on. We barely managed to get to the house, and we had to call someone to give us 2 liters of gasoline that I paid for in cash so  we could arrive.\n\nHis mom came back at 8 pm and we told her how we ran out of gas.\n\nThe next morning we were sleeping togeter, when she agresively knocks the door at 5am to wake my BF up (This is usual). After he got out of the room, she told him to drive her to work. I was burried in bedsheets, and then heard the loud tantrum outside after my boyfriend told her that the car had no gas. She was screaming for about 10-15 minutes: \n\nYES THE CAR WILL MAKE IT, SHIT SON, I CAN'T ASK YOU FOR A FUCKING FAVOR WITHOUT YOU BEING UNGRATEFUL, WHY CAN'T YOU TAKE ME TO WORK? WHAT AN INCONSIDERATE SON I HAVE, YOU WANNA MAKE ME WALK WITH HIS LEG? YOU WILL SEE THAT THE CAR STILL HAS ENOUGH GAS TO GET THERE!!!!!!!!!\n\nMy boyfriend got into the room, took the keys, shoes, and jacket got stormed out. I didn't get out of the bed.\n\nHe was back in like half an hour. He told me that after the car shutdown the first time while going uphill, she went quiet, the car did shutdown 3 more times, and she said nothing, maybe realizing that no, the car wont make it. They only managed to get to a bus stop where she can take a bus directly to her work, left her there, and came back. \n\nThe thing is that this woman NEVER learns from her mistakes because is somehow, always someone else's fault.  But at lest she might feel quietly ashamed this time.\n\nAnd don't worry, my boyfriend and I have an exit plan so he can cut contact with her, we both had enough.",

        "text": "Earlier this year, I adopted a 2 year old husky. Since his adoption, I have spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars toward his training.\n\nRecently, I have been caring for my sister's fully voice trained red heeler mix. To aid towards getting my husky off-lead trained like the heeler is, I have been tethering them together and letting the red heeler help train my husky off lead while walking along the trail that encircles the park near my apartment.\n\nTo be clear, I follow good etiquette and move off trail and have the dogs do a sit/stay when other trail users approach from either direction. My town has leash laws for all dogs that aren't voice trained. While my husky isn't fully trained, he will follow the heeler who is fully trained and mimic her movements.\n\nA few days ago, I was stopped by a park ranger who very politely informed me that a complaint had been filed by another trail user and I would need to have a full handheld lead attached to my dogs. The complaint was probably submitted by one of the cyclists who likes to ride a bazillion mph down the trails whom I have had a few issues with since they never use audio singles to inform me that they are coming up behind me. This is very poor etiquette even with leashed dogs as it takes time to move out of the way.\n\nQueue malicious compliance.\n\nI can't stop training my dogs just because some entitled miscreant can't be bothered to slow down or let me know that they are approaching me from the rear. So I procured a 15ft training lead that I attached to my 6ft split lead, which is attached to the 8ft leads that are attached to my dogs harnesses.\n\nThis keeps me in compliance with the polite and understanding park ranger's request while allowing me to simulate off-lead training. I still move off to the side and command a sit/stay when I know anyone is approaching since this is good etiquette and helps my dog understand that they can only approach people/other dogs if I allow it.\n\nYour move cycling Karen.",

When my daughter asked, I said yes honey you can. I was trying not to laugh as I said it. She was super excited and darted off.\n\nIf you are imagining tiny beads all over the floor, it didn't happen. My daughter was very careful. My sister did seem concerned though. Other family members laughed when they saw the kit open on the kitchen table.",

        "text": "Not me but a coworker. And sorry it's long, have to have a bit of context to get the full picture. \nI'm a manager at a fast-fashion store in a local mall. This story involves me, another manager who we'll call J, our store manager S, and two customers, D being the main one and A being the additional customer. There's also D's kid, but the child isn't really involved cause he's like 2 or 3. \nD is a regular customer, comes in once every 1-2 weeks. She very well fits the stereotype of what I'd call a \"professional Instagramer\" - constantly on her phone, kinda ditzy like she's not 100% there, wears sets that look very nice and is probably just from any old fast-fashion store, and acts very entitled. \nNo one who works there with me really likes D. She's doesn't say please or thank you when asking you to check a price or show her where the sets are and will definitely interrupt you if you're already helping another customer, even if that customer is someone you're checking out at the register. Every time she comes in, she spends upwards of $85+, which is good for our UPT, but she also does all of the things mentioned above, as well as rope at least one employee into essentially being there to help her specifically for at least 10 minutes at a time, which doesn't help if we're short-staffed or busy. She'll also come in 15-30 minutes before we close and meander around the store grabbing huge loads of clothes before heading to the fitting rooms. \nAbout a week ago, D came in with A, who we've never seen before so no problems with her, and D's kid, who's always there with her. It was slow and we had very few employees present due to payroll cuts so managers were pretty much the only ones in the store. \nAs soon as she walks in she sees a snow suit that had been an online return and she calls very loudly up to the register across the store:\n\"EXCUSE ME! DO YOU HAVE ANYMORE OF THESE?\" Granted, this is the first time I've heard her say excuse me, but yelling across the store seems unwarranted. S and J say to her in unison (which was completely unplanned) \"No, that was an online return so it's the only one.\" \nD makes some sort of comment like \"REALLY?\" And S says \"Yes. If the tag has *blank* indicator, it's the only one left.\" D then does her usual thing \"Oh. Where are the sets?\" S shows her the sets, during which S explains again what *blank* indicator means and tries to help D as best as they can. \nEventually S comes back and, since they had opened and it was nearing the time they were off, S said goodbye and clocked out. Time goes on, D tries on clothes, and then she comes up to the register. I'm in the middle of a project so J is on register and is ringing up another customer. D slams down an item with *blank* indicator clearly on the tag and says \"Do you have anymore of these?\" The other customer seems taken aback be D's rudeness and so is J who manages to simply say \"As said before, *blank* indicator means it's the last one.\" And again D says \"Really?\" To which J says \"Yes\" and finishes the transition with the other customer as D starts walking away, taking a moment to thank the other customer for nit being rude. \nD tries on more clothes with A entertaining D's kid and then it's time for my break. When I come back 10 minutes later, D is at the register with J checking her out. J has just uncensored an item and taken it off its hanger when D grabs it and goes back to the rack to switch it out for a medium. The item she grabbed was in fact already a medium. J is calling after her \"Miss? I need to recensor that if you're putting it back!\" I go over and ask her \"Are you putting that back?\" To which she thrusts it at me and says \"Yes\" and continues going through the rack until she finds a medium. She goes back up to the register and I go back up the long way to put a censor on the item and rehang it. J continues the transaction, but isn't bagging anything yet, just folding the items and putting them aside, because a number of items are final sale and it's easier to indicate which ones are final sale and which are returnable all at once. \nD: \"Aren't you going to bag them?\" \nJ:\"Yes, once I've scanned everything so I can just put it in the bag in one go.\" D continues looking at her items and talking to A. At the end of the transaction, D tells J that they scanned some things twice. The items aren't even bagged yet because of this insistence. J prints the receipt and goes over ever item with a pen, making sure they have all 14 items accounted for one and that there's not 16 items on the page like D claims. At the beginning, D and A re certain they're right and towards the end of the receipt, they get visibly discouraged that they're not. After satisfying that \"complaint\", J begins not very nicely tossing the items into a bag after indicating the final sale ones. J is just fed up with D's entitlement at this point and wants them to leave. \nD: \"Can you fold them nicely?\" J almost doesn't but stats to take the items back out anyway amd heres why- \nD: \"A I have an appointment in 10 minutes.\" \nCue malicious compliance. J very slowly starts refolding all the items and putting them very nicely in the bag. J is waiting for D to complain about this but she doesn't, probably because J is doing exactly what she wanted now. I don't know if she was late to her appointment but I'm pretty sure J took 3-5 minutes just to satisfy that little annoyed part of them with the knowledge that D would most likely be late to her appointment. \nIcing on the cake? At some point during the transaction, D told A in Spanish that J had \"(Their) finger nails painted like a b*tch\" J understands Spanish and just smiled at them, letting them know they knew *exactly* what they were saying. \nSorry this was so long, I like telling stories.",

Something drew me to her, her charisma and so on. For six months I pursued her and finally, on July 15, we started dating. That's when I found out about her twin sister, say Tracy. They weren't on good terms, I'll even say more, they hated each other. The whole family hated Tracy. Damn, but how similar they were, one to one, a clone. Yesterday I wanted to arrange for Stacy (we don't live together) to meet me at the club, to celebrate her success at work.\nBut coincidentally, Tracy (the evil twin sister) was at Stacy's house while Stacy was busy minding her own business. The phone fell into Tracy's hands -- she said she was coming over (on Stacy's behalf). She didn't lie, by midnight we were drunk and went back to my place and had a lot of sex, I noticed she was a little different in that way, new positions, \"shouting\" but I didn't give a shit - it was my best sex ever.\nMorning. I woke up to the sound of the alarm clock. There was a note on the bed, already wrinkled by my body, with a confession of her badness, describing in detail how much pleasure my penis had given her, how much pleasure the evening with me had given her, and how much pleasure she would get when Stacy found out about it. I haven't been in touch with Stacey, I feel bad, I know it's not my fault (like I wrote before, they're like two peas in a pod). I will continue to reddit when I check in with my girlfriend. I can't imagine how hurt she will be.\nMy story is wild, it's like something out of some crazy American movie from 2010, I can't believe it myself - I know now, anything can happen in life, even that.",

        "text": "In 2019 I started working for a big accounting firm right after college, I already had a bit of experience because of a dew internships and I always worked part-time since I was 16, but I was mainly hired because I spoke 4 languages and they had business with a lot of foreign clients.\n\nI was hired as a consultant but I did a lot of things, I really enjoyed organizing big files and I had a lot of experience with excel, since I had payed for a pro course during college, so besides my usual work of handling some clients and doing my reports, I was also doing a lot of things like sales reports, clients reports, basically most of the excel files and a lot of computer based tasks.\n\nWhen COVID hit and we started to work from home I was able to automate most of my tasks during 2 or 3 months, I was able to program a code that would basically do the sales reports (most important file) and a few more automatically and I could updated it if needed. My boss was over the moon with the update part but I did not told him that it was being done automatically, I did not told anyone for a matter of fact. This gave me a lot of extra time to talk to clients and pick up a few extra new ones which gave me a considerable pay rise, since I was highly appraised during the meetings with my direct boss and a few higher ups.\n\nWhenever I did take time off I had to delegate all of my tasks and clients meetings to anyone I trusted which was mostly Jimmy (fake name), Jimmy was a good personal friend of mine and was married to my cousin, so we would occasionally take time off at the same time for a vacation or family gathering. I was saving my vacation days for summer and winter, and in the only days I took during 2020, I let my tasks running automatically and I told Jimmy that he didn't need to do that, and he really didn't ask questions since it was less work for him. However me and Jimmy took a few days off at the same time to go to a wedding in another country and I was told by my boss that he would let it happen but to not make it a habit to take our vacation at the same time and that I would have to work a bit harder to thank him for his good deed and that my sales weren't getting any bigger in the last few months. I reminded him that I had the higher number of sales in all the department and I was the only one with the extra tasks, but he just told me that it wasn't a big deal, and that anyone could have done that. \n\nSo when I went of vacation I turned off all of my automated tasks, and this was a big deal since it was the end of the month and my boss would need all my reports completely updated. Apparently they had to put 5 people to do my tasks so that they could finish the reports, which delayed the work of that team, and the reports were late and lacked a few things that mine had.\n\nThis was big deal since all the higher ups weren't happy with my boss since he showed them the reports late, and it was clearly a downgrade from mine, and they also commented that there was a team failing a lot of deadlines that month (which was the team assigned to do my tasks).\n\nAs soon as I got back to work I got a call from my boss apologizing for not appreciating my work with the tasks, offering me a bonus and asking me to not take time off at the end of the month never again. I told him that it was a unreasonable request and I reminded him that he already approved of my week off in 2 months which he apparently was still under approval and he straight up told me that it wasn't going to be approved. I am not an angry person per usual but I got really upset about that, and the told me that as long as it wasn't at the end of the month, I could take time off whenever I wanted. Ok fine.\n\nAs soon as I got out of the call I started looking for other jobs and I scheduled all of my time off (about 3 weeks) to the next month (busiest month for us). This was a big deal since most of the big clients didn't spoke English or our native tongue and they only wanted to talk to me, but nevertheless my boss approved. Subsequently Jimmy also scheduled time off at the same time so despite not being end of the month, someone had to do my tasks since I would once again turned them off.\n\nApparently they weren't able to handle neither my clients or my tasks and they just ignored the tasks until I got back, but some of the clients or really angry since no one could really assist them as good as I could, and I actually got a call in my personal phone from one of them asking him to assist him in my personal time and that he would be really appreciative of my time.\n\nThis was a huge clients and he was actually a great person that had huge respects for me, so I said it was fine as long as he came to my location (I was in vacation with my family). So long story short the came with a yacht and invited all of my family to go there and to the villa he rented, I spent a whole day helping him and setting all of is orders and request and he was more than happy to offer me a job offer once he knew I was looking for other jobs, since apparently I sent my curriculum to one of his buddies company.\n\nIt was a huge offer with lots of benefits, and the offer would also extend to Jimmy, who was actually going to work for me, with a great salary also. In my country you don't have to give 2 weeks notice to your boss so I just quit when I returned and told him that I wouldn't to any of the sales reports, he was pissed but here was nothing he could do.\n\nI am still in the same company, but with a higher position now, I actually manage a huge team and I don't really have a schedule, I just have to travel a lot which is fine by me.\n\nLast I checked with a few friends that still work in my old company they had to hire a whole team to handle my tasks and a few of the clients quit because they weren't satisfied with how they being handled. Next time you should also value your employees more.",

        "text": "Not sure if this qualifies as Malicious Compliance.  If it does not, please let me know and I will remove the post.\n\nTL/DR:  Made a mistake entering my account information for a college tuition payment.  Put a hold on my account and told me I had to pay with cashier's checks from this point forward.  Threatened to flood them with cashier's checks and they removed the hold.\n\nFirst, some background.  My wife and I have used the same bank for years and they have a majority of our accounts.  All of our children have graduated from college so we decided to go back to college and my company offered to pay for my masters degree.  I use the college's payment plan for the first couple of months of the semester since my company pays in arrears for the classes and they depending on how paydays fall they can be a little slow to pay.\n\nOne of the payments I had to make I transposed two digits on the account information when I entered the payment information.  I always use an electronic check to pay so I can avoid the extra fees they tack on when using a credit/debit card.  Since the payment was returned as invalid, I now have a hold on my account and I have to pay with either a credit card or cashier's check.  Not a big deal since my company had sent the payment for the previous semester.  Put the semester on my credit card and then paid off the credit card.\n\nI called the Business Office (BO) and asked when could be done to have the hold removed from my account and they told me there was nothing that could be done to have the hold removed.  From this point forward I would have to pay with either a credit card or cashier's check.  After arguing with them a little bit they were steadfast in their position.\n\nI called my bank and they did the typical since you have been such a great customer, blah, blah, blah you have five (5) free cashier's checks per month.  And whenever the bank sends a cashier's check to a college we do not accept a signature from the mailroom, an individual must sign for it.  \n\nCue malicious compliance.\n\nI called the university back and asked to speak to the same person I was speaking to.  When I had them on the phone the conversation went something like this.\n\nMe:  Hey!  It's OP how are you doing?\n\nBO:  Fine.  How are you?\n\nMe:  Great.  Question about the payment plan.  I just have to make the minimum payment by the date it is due correct?  It does not matter how many checks I send.  Correct?\n\nBO:  You have to send cashier's checks.  But, that is correct.\n\nMe:  Right.  Cashier's check.  My bank gives me five free cashier's checks a month and someone must sign for each of them so I will be sending four for each monthly payment.  Should I have them sent directly to you?\n\nBO:  This would be much easier if you just paid with a credit card.\n\nMe:  It would be easier for you!   I want you to think about this.  I have three semesters of school left and I have to take two summer classes.  That means your office is going to receive approximately 72 cashier's checks they have to sign for and manually process.\n\nBO:  (silence)\n\nMe:  Since the checks have to be sent to a specific person, who should I have the checks sent to?\n\nBO: (silence)\n\nMe:  Since you do not have an answer for me right now, I will call back when the next semester starts and get that name from you.  Thank you for your help today and I look forward to talking with you at the start of the next semester.\n\nWhen I logged in at the start of the next semester, the hold on my account was removed.  When I called the Business Office they stated they had reviewed my account and determined it was an honest mistake and I should not be penalized.",

It was very busy and so as I saw someone returning their trolley, I decided to wait for them to come out so I could take their space.\n\nAs they reversed towards me, to head towards the exit that was in the other direction, a car the other side of them was driving up and immediately sped into the space. Very frustrating but I thought nothing of it as there's no point getting annoyed by these things.\n\nThen the car on the driver's side of the annoying car put its reverse lights on. I let them come out and went to drive into their space.\n\nBy this point, the annoying car driver hadn't left his car and I saw that his tyres were slightly over the line. For those who don't know what spaces are like in the UK, they're very small. I could tell that there was a lot of space the other side of the car, so it wasn't as though they were forced to park like that.\n\nSo when I pulled into the space, I parked normally and completely in the centre of the space, not slightly to one side.\n\nI got out of the car and walked away. I heard a car door open and looked back and saw this very overweight guy trying to get out of his car with very little space. He gave up after a minute, started his car again to rejig his car so it fit the space better.\n\nSide note: as he was trying to get out of his car, I took a picture because I suspected he may try and dent my door. If I had a picture of him doing it, with his numberplate in view, that would be good evidence to claim on insurance if he had dented my door. Fortunately, he hadn't and there wasn't even a minor scratch.",

        "text": "TLDR at the bottom 😉\n\nMany, MANY years ago I did tech support for MSN and WebTV in an MCI Worldcom building. \n1st, a lil background: \n- I worked a 4 x 10 shift [noon to 11PM]. \n- The restrooms weren't centrally located and it was literally 2m17s walk. (Yes, I actually timed it). So if I only just washed my hands, it would send a flag up. \n- If you weren't logged in for more than 5 mins, it alerted a supervisor. \n\n\nI'm sure you already see where this is going.  My lunch/dinner break was about 6 and then around 8:30 PM Id have to drop the kids off at the pool.  So eventually  my performance review comes up, and stellar remarks across the board. However, they notice that like clockwork, I'm away from my desk for 11- 14 minutes. I shared how much time it took to walk round trip from my desk and that it would be impossible to conduct ANY business properly without running afoul of the 5 minute limit. Then they actually asked if I could just wait until my shift was over. After laughing before realizing that they weren't joking, I also very politely and delicately reminded them on how human biology works (the FIFO principle) and that it would not be reasonable to expect me to wait until almost midnight. They said they understood but would I please let them know when I'll be away from desk. I said \"Sure, no problem. So , whilst sitting there I wrote out a note. \"Every  day @ 8:30 I will be relieving myself in the lavatories and will be back at my desk within 15 minutes\". I handed it in and said \"Here's my blanket notice, any questions?\". They were pissed and accepted it but never hassled me about the bathroom again. (I actually was a GREAT tech, and I think thats why they didn't can me on the spot for my smart-assedness) A few months later I quit and moved to VA. \n\nTLDR: Company wants to be notified everytime I go poo, I write up a blanket notice. They're pissed. They leave me alone. I get hassle-free poo time.",

        "text": "Few years ago, after graduating jhs, my friends and I were able to land a part time job at a fast food restaurant. I work on the kitchen and my job is to prepare the food that includes soup, noodles, and desserts (not all food are prepared in our workstation).\n\n11am to 2pm is when people starts flocking so the orders quickly piles up, we call it rush hour. Morning shifts has to take their break at 10 so they could come back 11:30.\n\nFew months into working and I get to learn how to shift from working to desserts to meals. If there are few orders of the meals I will help in desserts, since it always piles up.\n\nMy usual managers have no issue in here. However this particular week, a new manager comes and the usual manager thought it would be a good idea to let her observe in the kitchen first. For the first few days, she would just stand in the corner and the my seniors would teach her the \"standard\" of the food we're preparing in the kitchen after rush hour. After a few days, she would start to point out a few things I do, why this and that (since after orders died down, I would do the refills and such) I don't really mind however, I noticed she would only this to me no matter how small the mistake is like,  how I'm messy I work just because there's a few drops left on the counter whenever I refill which I quickly clean. \n\nHere comes the malicious compliance. As rush hour comes my senior started his break a bit late, so me and my newbie co worker (in charge for desserts) were the ones in kitchen. And since orders for desserts starts to pile up, I started to help out with desserts since I can easily finish the meals. And this manager noticed what I was doing and instead of helping out she straight out said, \"Can't you just stay in one place?\" with the hint of annoyance in her tone. So me and co-worker just stared at here for a few seconds before continuing our work. Then she grabbed me in my arm and drag me in the parallel work station where I prepare meals said, \"You have one job and do it here\" even raising her tone. I tried to explain that I can still do the meals while helping out and the orders for desserts are starting to pile up. But still said the same thing. And so I did the orders just for meals, I pity my coworker who starts to panic since there's a lot of follow up orders. And whenever I look at her she would just stare at us. \n\nMy senior who just came back from his break quickly helped with desserts and me just taking my time preparing the meals. After the rush hour, my senior asked me why I was not helping with the desserts and why I let the my coworker who just started recently to do the work. I tell him what happened and my coworker also told him what happened. Good thing he relayed it to our (usual) manager and she never did it again. She would still point out every little mistake I did every now and then but would let me do my work peacefully.",

        "text": "So the context is that I work on a resort Island. Everything is really great, except one thing: the toilet in my room really sucks and clogs very easily. Every shit I take clogs the toilet (I have really big poops in general, and only poop once every 3-6 days). The first few weeks I was here, HR would send someone to unclog my toilet each time, but I think they eventually got done with my shit and started to ignore my requests for an unclogged toilet. It would eventually flush after repeated flushing over the course of a couple of days.\n\nOn the days that I need to take a poop and my toilet is still clogged, I started using the guest toilet. This toilet is rarely used by guests (since they have their own restrooms in their rooms), and I took extra care to only use it late at night when no guests were around, cleaned up after myself, etc. Also the flush was really powerful and I never ever clogged it. However, eventually HR noticed and told me that I was not allowed to use the guest toilet anymore. So now they are ignoring my requests to unclog my toilet and also not allowing me to use the guest toilet.\n\nFortunately for me, there is one last toilet available for me. The subsequent time this shitty situation arose where I had to take a shit and my room toilet was clogged, I walked straight into HR's office and into their toilet. Took a lovely dump and the toilet clogged hard. Left with a smile all the while making eye contact with the HR manager as I left.",

        "text": "My boss has recently become incredibly strict with start times at work, penalising the slightest lateness. For context, I work in nursing at a semi-rural hospital. It was built about a decade ago in anticipation of the area developing, which it since has. But this means that most of us staff who have been around a while have a fair commute. For me it’s about 40 minutes each way, so lots of time for delays. Add to that the parking areas are being upgraded, so that’s a nightmare. What this means is that it’s common for staff to be a bit late for shift. Not massively late, never more than a few minutes, but we have always been understanding of each other as we are all in the same situation. \n\nUp until recently this wasn’t an issue. Except inexplicably our boss has made this their project to solve. How? By docking pay for any missed time, that how. Now in the grand scheme, no one is losing more than a dollar or two at most to this change. However each time it happens we have to fill out shift variance forms and submit them through an archaic HR system. It’s got the team very frustrated. But the boss insists that if we are on time, there isn’t a problem, and that we should show more respect for the hospitals time. It’s only right that we are only paid for the time we are at work. \n\nNow this last bit really ruffled some feathers. See as nurses, we work a shift of 8 1/2 hours. We are paid for 8 hours (unpaid break). But we NEVER finish on time. Thats because patients don’t work around our shedules. You could be in the middle of handover to end your day and little old Mrs Jenkins comes walking down the hall stark naked leaking piss from the untapped catheter bag dragging between her legs. So gotta deal with that. Or your elbow deep in human shit, fighting off the claws of a dementia-strong patient when the second shift crew arrives. Or handover is delayed entirely because management insist on having a meeting about something that should have been an email. \n\nMy point is that we regularly stay 10 -15 minutes over our shift times, and we accept that that’s how it goes. we can’t just bounce at 3:15 on the dot, that’s no fair or safe. So given the extra we put in, the move from management to penalise lateness is coming across petty and vindictive.\n\nSo, the malicious compliance: as the boss said, we are only to be paid for the time we are at work. So now the entire team is dutifully noting every minute of extra time they have to stay on shift past finishing time. And every time they do, they submit a shift variance form to the boss to ensure they are correctly compensated. And all of these forms need to be reviewed by the boss before being signing off. And each review requires the boss to submit a report to payroll as to why the variance occurred. Basically they are receiving a dozen forms a day, claiming more pay that far exceeds what was being lost by there new approach. It took three days for the boss to call a meeting and inform us that the changed policy was being rolled back, which we all appreciate immensely. \n\nWe do however plan to keep claiming all our extra time, at least for a while. Wouldn’t want them getting any new ideas……",

Part of our expectations as underwriters is to decision at least 3 apps each hour. If we do not meet this request then we are out on warnings and are subject to being fired.\n\nI work alone with another underwriter on Sundays. He let me know that he was very low on his decisions per hour and in the spirit of cooperation - and because my numbers are always well above that due to experience - I ask him how many apps he’d like to decision out of the main queue and it is first come first served for decisions. At first he was appreciative of the help and would let me know how much he was going to do and I’d be sure to leave the applications for them.\n\nA month ago - he IMd me and told me to stop asking him how many apps he was going to do that day as he was feeling micromanaged. I let him know that I was just trying to help him meet his numbers and that I was only asking to make sure I didn’t get in the way. He told me to stop communicating with him and to just work the queue. (I made sure to document the conversation should there be any backlash for the upcoming malicious compliance.)\n\nFrom that day on - I just used my experience to my advantage and claimed as many apps as I could. On a normal Sunday there is around 150 apps. Under our arrangement before - I did half of them and left the other 75ish for him. The queues and how intense the applications can be varies which is why I’d always communicate with him. After that - I did as many apps as I felt I could while still being accurate as that is another thing we are judged on. \n\nFor the last 3 Sundays the amount of apps the other  underwriter did has gone down to around 20 apps each Sunday due to how fast and accurately I was able to get through the rest of the queue. I also stopped answering his questions in the chats and said that I was too busy working to answer his questions.\n\nHe is now on a verbal warning - and he is too prideful to tell me he was wrong or apologize - so I’m keeping course. I was able to change shifts and no longer work Sundays due to how good my numbers look so I will no longer have to work with him alone on Sunday. I still refuse to answer his questions the other days of the week we work. I have not been approached by my management for my malicious compliance and have only been praised on my work thus far.",

All salons were now making more revenue and profit than ever before as per my guidelines except one. I decided stop visit the one under performing store and asked for a haircut and was told promptly by the receptionist that we do not offer men’s haircuts as instructed by the manageress, I asked to speak with the manatees and was greeted by an attractive early 20 year old brunette and I repeated the same question and she told me that as a women’s only saloon that they do not do men’s haircuts, I replied but it is advertised on the door and you have a male barber, she told me that it was her policy and unless the owner or new owner came down and enforcers it she would not comply. I asked what would happen if the new male owner came down and asked her, she said she would take him to the back room and proceed to drop to her knees.

I told no one. \n\nI would never disrespect a teacher even with what she did and when the rest of the class bullied her and made her cry I was in the nice corner she turned to.

        "text": "I work at an electronics manufacturing company as a quality inspector. There are some products that need to be x-rayed and ICT-ed (in-circuit test). We have both inline x-ray and ICT machines. The x-ray just works, but the ICT test program sometimes errors out.\n\nUsually, 99%of times, there is an error message, which just needs to be dismissed and the machine will continue testing. There are a few occasions when the test program needs to be restarted, in which case, we need to call the technican.\n\n###The malicious compliance:\n\nThe ICT stopped and I went there to check it out. It was not the usual error message, so I left it to tell my supervisor, the line leader, to call the technican. But, before I could do so, the technican arrived and accused me of closing the test program. I argued with him that I absolutely did NOT close it and that I was expecting the usual error message. He didn't take it and told me and my supervisor that we are, under no circumstances, allowed to touch the inline ICT.\n\n###The fallout:\n\nHe didn't leave for 5 minutes when the ICT stopped again. It was the usual error message. I told the line leader to call the technican while I start a downtime in the ODS (online downtime system). He did and he was told to \"just dismiss the error message\" because he was having lunch. My supervisor told him that he said that we are not allowed to touch machine under any circumstances. He was not having it, but we didn't care. If we're not allowed to touch it, we won't.\n\nAfter he finished lunch, he came there, dismissed the error message and started to argue with us. We said \"but you told us we're not allowed to touch it\", so we didn't.\n\nIn the end, he had to close down a 30 something minute downtime for what would've otherwise taken a few seconds. From then on, we are allowed to dismiss the error message, but only that. We, of course, are not having it. We are not allowed to touch the ICT under any circumstances after all.",

        "text": "I a 32m work as a repair technician for a retail store that repairs automotive and devices. I do the occasional sales as part of my job, but there has always been a need for someone to do repairs on a daily basis. I was hired for full time work which they begged me not to quit due to a bad company culture. There we're a lot of red flags, but I needed a job so I stayed. I ended up taking the majority of the work loads in various areas in the retail store and doing majority of the device repairs that came in. Occassionally I'd work on some trucks, suvs or cars that would come in for diagnostics and maintenance repairs. Then help customers pick and choose what they wanted or needed for their automotive and devices. Open and close the store alone while handling the registers with deposits. It's a decent job, but there are no benefits, hardly any breaks, and meager pay. So for the past several months, corporate and management haven't trained anyone to fill in for my position in case something comes up. \n\nWell I hurt myself on the job when doing inspections and they refused to give or provide me the means to file workers compensation. Prior before that they kept sending me home over covid related concerns or when the business slowed down for the day. Issue is that I am medically diagnosed with asthma and trying to breath is hard when you have an asthma attack. I have an medication, but it only does so much. So when I inquired about workers compensation and explained my situation they began radio silence. No one would provide me the documentation or allow me to report my injury. So rolling into the following week they quitely scheduled me off from Tuesday without saying anything. When I discovered what happened I asked why is my schedule so different? \"We figured you wanted Tuesday off. So you'll no longer be allowed to work on Tuesday ever again.\" I replied, \"Shouldn't you have discussed with me first about this first?\" Manager and corporate replied, \"We don't need to discuss this any further.\" I replied, \"Well okay then.\" Two months into this issue, I have been getting calls and texts to come in because people have been calling out or not showing up due to illnesses and the bad weather. \"Hi I know this may be an inconvience, but can you come in this Tuesday? We don't have a technician available to cover.\" I replied, \"I'm sorry, but I am not allowed to work on Tuesdays.\" A week later I get a call, \"I need someone to come in to open this Tuesday, can you open?\" I responded, \"I am terribly sorry, but you said it yourself along with corporate that I am never allowed to work on Tuesdays again.\" This goes on repeat many times and I give them the same response. And guess what? They lost a lot of sales, be because turns out I am on the top leaderboard for sales on Tuesday. I come in a few days later and asked what happened, \"It was insane, we had so many people come in for repair orders and no one was able to do repairs. We lost a lot of revenue and important clients.\" I gave them a smug look and smile, \"Well I no longer work on Tuesdays.\"\n\nDue to no longer working Tuesdays, I managed to find a new job on my free time that pays me twice as much and gave them my two weeks notice on Tuesday of course. And guess what I am quitting on Tuesday. So now my corporate and manager is rushing to train people to do the work that I do. I am absolutely enjoying this because the sheer panic as they try to find someone to replace me.\n\nTLDR: No longer allowed to work Tuesday. I comply,  employers wants me to work Tuesday. Only specialist at work. Causes them to lose profits and customers. Gave two weeks notice on Tuesday and leaving Tuesday.",

Well at the end of her bullying me and excluding me era my parents and brothers knew what happened. Now here we are 4-5 years later. She’s a junior in hs (a year she bullied me in). This is the funny part:\n\nMy brother has a friend group of his hockey friends. One of his friends knew this group of girls who went to a school. The same school my bully went to and she was part of that friend group. my brother and his friends ended up taking each one of the girls to homecoming. It was cute but this part is funny. They are doing a secret santa. And my bully is NOT included cuz no one likes her and she’s mean. My brother told them what she did and gives another reason why they didn’t count her in (they don’t invite her to many things anymore either) So remember kids.\n\nKarma is real and it IS a bitch and will bite you in the ass when you least expect it ;)",

The pay wasn't great but the company had great conditions and interesting work. They did varied work from making custom parts for racing cars to large jobs for the navy. There was under fifty staff on the floor. My brother Peter is the leading hand and answered to the floor supervisor who answers directly to the engineers (owners).\n\nThe supervisor retires and my brother applies for the job but misses out. The new supervisor arrives and is a tyrant.  On his first day he harasses Peter about missing out on the job and that he is the new boss now so get used to it. A couple of days later the supervisor asks my brother to run his CNC machine 20% faster. My brother objects but the supervisor insists .My brother says sure your the boss. i will make it go 20% faster. Within minutes the alloy they were working gets damaged(not quite sure how or why as I'm not a tradie). \n\nSuddenly the engineers appear and question my brother about what happened. The supervisor appears and blames my brother. Fortunately a couple of tradesman heard the previous conversation and back Peter's story. The supervisor get berated by the owners. My brother applied for another job soon after this and gets it. The new Job pays so much better and it's a supervisors job. About six weeks after Peter left, the owners from his previous job ring him and offer him the supervisor job as they have sacked the supervisor due poor work standards, Peter declines.",

According to her I was “throwing” her items but of course because the customer is ALWAYS right I listened and of course gave her the most sincere apology I’ve ever given anyone. Instead of scanning the barcode,  I typed each one into the system manually. Safe to say I could see the panic in her face as the queue got longer but oh the sweet satisfaction I got from her not being able to tell me to now speed up the scanning.",

This was my third year of managing around 5 different branches in this process and the town’s treasurer(TT )was very seasoned as well. It was a known fact that the newly appointed city treasurer (CT) was out of her league and had screwed her way into the position. (A whole other story time)\n\nAnyway we are all in this 30 minute meeting at best that turns into 3 hours of my life that I can’t get back. 25 minutes in the TT has no issues updates the lists and were good to go. Then the CT takes the next two hours to explain how to first take a deposit outlining which account it is supposed to go into( there is only one and it says taxes on it). Then follows up with your people you manage need to validate each persons tax bill three times and deposit them separately into the account. Questioning this I get told that I am here to take notes and make her the CT look good in front of her bosses. \n\nNow because we the bank offer this service the city then pays us for usage of people, equipment etc it’s submitted weekly by me along with the reports for the taxes for the years end. \n\nEnter Malicious Compliance. She wants 3:1 checks with a deposit and is paying for the workers time to do it can I get that in an email? Email sent great game on. TT and their taxes go off with no problems final paperwork sent off all is good with life. CT was losing her shit all 5 branches instead of making 1 deposit with 30 entries made 1 deposit for 1 entry and a double check of each. This added 4 hours to each day of the 4 weeks we take taxes in winter. Deposits just stacking up in her office daily and her just getting irate about it blaming me so she goes and gets her boss and fills him up to speed. \n\nSo he gets done with his fumbling and I ask them if they would like to see a magic trick. They sure, what, watch then as I pull my get out of jail free card out, what you don’t have those. Damn wish the best.",
