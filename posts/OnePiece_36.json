Im a bio major and we are learning about the phylogenetic trees (kingdom, domain, phylum, class… genus, species)and I noticed that another name for the kingdom Animalia is metazoa, and I first thought this was a coincidence, but when I continued to study I found the domains of animalia to be something ending in -zoa. Zoa being the base word and zoan being the plural version of the word in Latin. So my thought was I wonder if there are the other 2 categories names hidden in science. 4 months later I’ve found the second category: Paramecia. Being the plural for Parameciums which is a unicellular cell that lives in all types of water. The word in Latin means “oblong”. Finding out these 2 were connected to this dead language I knew what to search; I found that logia in Latin means “indicating the science or study of”. So basically it’s the ending -logy (biology, technology, archaeology, etc). 2 of those names make solid sense, but paramecia is a stretch saying that it’s unique powers /oblong cell (a unique shape of a cell).",

        "text": "I realized something. Oda intentionally made Kid parallel Shanks.\n\n* red hair\n* scar on eye\n* one arm\n* conqueror's haki\n\nHowever, Kid makes up for his missing arm by creating one out of metal.\n\nSo I feel like those theories about Shanks making a haki arm might honestly make sense. I mean think about it. Shanks is a yonko, one of the most powerful people in one piece. Why would he restrict himself to only having one arm, when he could easily replace it?\n\n* force Judge/Vegapunk/Caesar/etc. to make it for him\n* get some sort of DF to create a prosthetic(literally any logia, a handful of paramecias, and a few zoans)\n* hunt down Law, Mansherry, or anyone who could have healing abilities.\n* use a makeshift prosthetic like Neko and Inu\n\nI feel like the only reason he'd only have one arm is if he can already supplement his disability with his powers. \n\nShanks is one of the strongest haki users. We know that armament and conqueror's haki can function as auras and be used to create barriers. So why can't a haki master like Shanks take the aura one step further and create structures, such as an arm, out of haki aura?\n\nIn fact, why even limit it to one arm. Why can't shanks make dozens of haki arms? While this might sound speculative, we've already seen a power that works like this, or is similar to this, in one piece. Zoro's asura.\n\nAsura is a form that Zoro conjures via his spirit. Now this could mean that asura is haki outright, or that it is some sort of other tangential power tied to his spirit.\n\nI feel like if Zoro can do something like this, surely a yonko like shanks who has no DF power of his own would be able to tap into it to make up for his disability.",

        "text": "After reading the new SBS, I was rather disappointed with the decision that Oda didn't dedicate a chapter or 2 about Zoro discovering that he is from Wano. I thought that it could be a chance to grow Zoro's character, considering he is known as a guy who just drinks and is badass. \n\nHere is how I would write it: he meets Yasuie in the same way and goes off traveling together. While walking, Yasuie looks at Zoro and begins to wonder why he looks so familiar, so Yasuie asks him if he has family from Ringo? Zoro comes clean about who he is and that he is from Shimotsuki village in the east blue. Yasuie is shocked and puts the pieces to the puzzle together as he remembers a ship of Shimotsuki clan members leaving Wano 55 years ago. He knows that Ushimarus sister left and believes that he could be a relative of Ushimaru. When asked if he knew who his grandmother could be, Zoro replies that he doesn't know nor that he really cares too much about it. Yasuie then takes him to Ringo and explains to Zoro how he might be a relative of the famous green bull that ruled this land and how he was a descendant of Ryuma. Even though Yasuie doesn't have enough to prove it, he knows for certain that he is a Shimotsuki and has a connection to Ringo. Zoro actually agrees and feels a sense of pride walking around. He sits down and prays amongst the grave yards marked with swords. Zoro leaves with Yasuie and goes back to Ebisu. Skip to where Yasuie dies, and it is revealed that he did not eat a smile but was only pretending. He gives a speech and finishes it off with a smile, then gets executed. While Yasuie didn't say, Zoro could see that the reason he was smiling was so he could make his daughter and the villagers of Ebisu happy. Zoro is upset because he felt a connection to Yasuie and now smiles and laughs more often to pay respect to his friend and fellow clan member Shimotsuki Yasuie. \n\nI kind of just thought of this and decided to write it. I like it because Zoro acknowledges that he is from Wano, doesn't really care that he might be a relative of Ushimaru and Ryuma, and actually decides to pay respect to Yasuie rather than be pressured to surpass Ryuma and Ushimaru just because he carries the bloodline. \n\nI would love to read how you would change Wano to fit a story about Zoro in.",

Also simple:\n\n- Roger wants a kid since Oden had one on the ship\n\n- Roger gets to Laugh Tale, but turns out that Ivan and Dragon and the Revs are all already there, since their best bet at fighting the government is to get the strongest pirate on their side\n\n- They lay out the following plan, which is why Roger laughed...\n\n1. Ivan turns Roger into a woman\n2. Dragon and Rogerette get it on\n3. Rogerette births child\n4. Rogerette can be turned back into a man\n5. Abandon child in East Blue and let him figure it out\n6. Profit\n\n\n\nWhy did it need to be Roger and Dragon, you ask?\n\n- gives Luffy the will of D, for government-fighting purposes\n\n- also gives the Revolutionaries a figurehead to back through Dragon\n\n- gives the pirates somebody to root for through Roger (still to be revealed, of course)\n\n- as mentioned earlier, Roger's will gives Luffy the drive to be pirate king, which is crucial to build his strength\n\n\nThe oversight: Ivan used too many hormones on Rogerette when he reverted him, which caused Roger to fall ill, soon to die an early death. We know this is the case from Ivan's hormonal changes, which was foreshadowed during Impel Down (when he heals Luffy from poison and \"takes some of his lifespan\")\n\nFinally, Roger is executed before he dies from the hormones. Dragon goes back every so often to that place to mourn the death of his lover, and he happened to be there during Luffy's near execution, saving his child when he couldn't save his woman.\n\nThank you.",

        "text": "With the recent reveal of Zoro's lineage in the SBS for volume 105, I've seen lots of people upset that it wasn't explored more during Wano. But I'm curious, what would be the added significance of establishing Zoro's heritage in the manga versus in the SBS? \n\nZoro has never cared about his ancestry or origins beyond his friendship with Kuina. The only person that would even definitively know this information is Koushiro, who's way back East Blue. Even if the old heads of Wano figured it out after the Ushimaru parallels, and told Zoro \"hey you're actually pseudo-royalty and the descendent of Ryuma\", would Zoro care? Would it have changed anything about how the events of Wano shaped out? \n\nThe people of Wano have already recognized him as one of their saviors, and a couple like Hyou and Kawamatsu made the Ryuma connection on their own which is plenty enough for me. I have no issue with the deep dive happening in the SBS because, as Oda said, it isn't going to be relevant to the plot. Zoro's arc has never been about his lineage or having a secret connection with an old hero; he's out here making a name for himself out of personal pride and a promise to his deceased friend which helped shape his world-view. \n\nI feel like the same people who complain that Zoro's family history wasn't explored more in Wano are the same people who get upset when an important character is revealed to have been special since birth due to their lineage. One Piece has showed us time and time again, that one's birth does not dictate their standing in the world and it's up to their independent will to determine how far their ideologies will get them.",

        "text": "For the record, I don't mean \"because it's unrealistic\" which I think is pretty stupid reasoning when our main cast includes a talking reindeer, a skeleton, a fishman and a cyborg powered by cola.\n\nWhat I mean is, remember Teach's famous line \"a man's dream will never die!\" ? This is arguably one of  the most important sentences in the story but I feel like there's some confusion about what this really means. After all, what happens when you achieve a dream, or what a dream becomes impossible? Does the dream die then? Roger's certainly didn't. The man laughed happily when he realized he'd achieved his dream only to find it was completely pointless. 22 years after he died Luffy is chasing the same dream he had now, and whether he accomplishes it or fails I don't think that would really be the end either.\n\nSee, the thing I think people are missing is that as cliche as the explanation has become, One Piece really is all about the journey. Lets say for example that Chopper found the cure for all the world's diseases, and he even managed to accomplish Hogback's dream of finding a cure for death itself! Would that really be a happy ending, or after a while would people just get bored of living after a while and end up like Kaido – hollow, miserable and unable to die? Part of the reason people chase after dreams is because they know they won't live forever. In that case, isn't the happy ending that they live to pass on their dreams, and see that the next generation has a grand adventure of their own?\n\nMaybe I'm just being dumb, but maybe it's better if dreams never really end",

        "text": "To preface Zoro has been my favorite character in all of anime/manga for 20 years, but not a Stan, I never once believed in ZKK etc. In fact I was very excited and thankful that Zoro made it to the roof itself. I fully expected him to play a similar role to Sanji and stay on the ground floor. Zoro dealing a scar itself to Kaido and learning AdvCoC was beyond my expectations, but Zoro was never destined to kill or beat Kaido. That is Luffy's role and I recognize that Zoro is Luffy's right hand man not the MC. So now I hopefully established that I can read the story. \n\nSo what is the problem with this SBS? To be frank, Zoro's lineage never mattered. That's not his character and it will not change his goals or his motivations. The problem in itself is the lack of representation and respect of Zoro in the plot. With Sanji receiving WCI as an arc centered around him, every SH has received plots and arcs centered around them except Zoro. Nami - Arlong Park, Usopp - Syrup village and a strong role in water 7, Sanji - WCI, Chopper - Drum Island, Robin - Enies Lobby, Franky - Water 7/Enies Lobby, Brook - Thriller Bark. Every arc character's have moments, but these arcs were centered around or empowered by the respective character's development. I don't think it is unreasonable to expect more from Zoro, especially within the land of swordsman. But he never mentioned once he wanted to be the world's strongest swordsman in 150+ chapters? Nidai kitetsu was shown, okay and….. nothing. Zoro wanted to visit Ryumas grave, okay and…… nothing. Parallels drawn to Ryuma, okay and….. nothing. Black blades were touched on, okay and…. nothing. Never before seen grim reaper hallucinations were seen, okay and…… nothing. Oda has completely disregarded Zoro since post TS. Cool badass one line -&gt; Cut -&gt; Repeat. There is no depth to Zoro’s character since post TS. For him to be called a wing of the Pirate King we should assume him to be ATLEAST equally treated to Sanji, a character so well written and strong. Zoro does all that training and Sanji still keeps up with him cooking majority of the time. No matter how you feel about Zoro's character itself, the fact is that Zoro is the 2nd most popular character in the series as shown in the worldwide poll. So for a part of Zoro's story to be shown in an SBS is frustrating. And for people dismissing that Zoro's family tree doesn't matter. Oda explicitly wrote Ryuma parallels in the story and had characters discussing it. It is clearly something he wanted to touch on and still might.  I feel Oda knows no matter what Zoro will always be around 2nd on the popularity polls and he doesn’t have to flesh out his character. Hoping atleast the Mihawk rematch is respected.",

Is that facts?\nIf it's available in English, can someone point to where I can get vol 102/103? \nIf it's not available in English yet, how are there so many spoilers?! Are there that many people on this subreddit from Japan? Do that many people just read Japanese? \nThrough my own foolishness, i got some spoilers and I need closure!

Well, from what we seen of him, he's all about upholding power structures, without considering their morality - protect those on top, oppress those on the bottom. This doesn't just concerns WG - be it out of respect for the powers that rule that world or simple cowardice, he's openly refuses to engage with Yonko, which also upholds existing power structure. So, his justice is about protecting the interests of the strong. In other words, he follows the Law of the Jungle.",

If someone bought like 10 devil fruits and fed them to their subordinates, they are only going to get one Devil fruit user while the rest become laughing nut jobs who can't swim with no powers.\n\nEven when the SMILE Devil fruit works, the consumer just gets a weird animal mutation such as having canines for arms, animal heads bursting out of your stomach, or straight up having entire animal bodies growing out of you. If anything, I believe these SMILE Devil fruits actually make the consumers weaker with how they are only a nuisance to any New World Pirate worth remembering. The real powerhouses of the New World are the ones with actual devil fruits.\n\nWhat do you think? Are SMILE Devil fruits really that valuable as Doflamingo claims they are? Why does Kaido seem intent on giving such weak devil fruits to his subordinates instead of a actual devil fruits?",

        "text": "One Piece looks at certain concepts and will sometimes offer a different perspective. Though the Ope Ope no Mi can give immortality, it may not be all it's cracked up to be. That's the reasoning behind the first possibility of Zoro being immortal. But first, WHY do I think this? Mostly because there's a break this week, but also because I was re-watching Thriller Bark, and when the first bit of Luffy's pain hit our green-haired friend my thought was \"That mfer should be dead.\" Even Kuma said so. So why isn't he?!\n\n1. Zoro currently holds the Sandai Kitetsu, a supposedly \"cursed\" blade. Though the curse is said to bring a tragic death to the wielder, what would be more tragic than dying right before your life-long goal? I'm not really buying it either so let's move onto the most likely possibility.\n\n2. Kuina's Wado Ichimonji holds either a curse, or her spirit/dream. If Kuina's dream works like a Devil Fruit, and was manifested in the blade upon her death, Zoro could be under a type of protection, and able to take much more punishment than normal. On the flip side, what kind of dexterous swordsman falls down the dang stairs?! Ya kiddin' me? Either the sword caused her to fall, or it claimed her at the moment she was on them. Whether the blade kills its wielder or steals their soul for power, the reason Zoro defies death may be this blade.\n\n2.5 We've seen Basil Hawkins redirect death, and while it was the power of a DF, it shows that that power is possible in the OP universe. But that wouldn't apply to either blade as one takes lives and the other had a user die with it.\n\n3. According to my horrible math skills, Law ate the Ope-Ope-no Mi at age 13, Zoro being 8 years old at the time. This gives us 8 years of possible Immortality Surgery usage. Why would someone use it on a child? I don't know- **looks over at Funkfreed** stranger and stupider things have happened. Maybe Kuina happened to eat the fruit and did it accidentally.\n\n\nSo basically there's no good reason why I think this, it's easily explained away by \"fiction battle damage.\" But I will keep thinking this until proven otherwise because it's more interesting, even if the chances are as slim as Alvida.

        "text": "The real captain (William) Kidd was hanged twice. That's a historical fact. What I believe that means for the story is Eustass Kid will die on Elbaf. He's not gonna lose an arm, he's not gonna lose a leg or an eye, he's gonna die. If you consider taking on an emperor alone to be suicide, or certain death, this is his metaphoric second hanging. As far as we can tell there is nobody coming to help him. Sorry fans of Kidd... \n\nNone of the New Giant Warrior Pirates were seen on Elbaf in this last chapter. This is obviously intentional. I don't have any solid ideas as to what's going on with the relationship between the originals and the new, but my guess is that they came to some kind of agreement.  I would love to hear theories as to how this meeting/agreement happened and what it means for the future of OP.\n\nLaw has the will of D. Blackbeard feels pain much more than everyone else because of his fruit. Garp is on his way to challenge Blackbeard and rescue Koby. Those are the facts. I would infer that if anybody in the one piece universe is a master of putting the pain on a MFer, it would be Garp. However Law is almost the opposite, being a doctor, it doesn't look like his attacks ever really \"hurt\" people. Law stands no chance, but Garp is coming to the rescue. Garp \"teams up with Law\" beats Koby out of BB, but because of Van Augur nobody dies in this encounter.\n\nGarp retires (random and baseless theory)\n\nThe straw hats still have their grand fleet in the pocket. There are 100 navy ships on their way to Egghead. I remember Fishman Island just like everybody else, and sure, they can take on 100,000 enemies, but I think this time it's different. I think this would be the perfect opportunity for the grand fleet to show up. They got Luffy's Vivre card, and you can be sure that puppy was fizzling down to a small fragment during the Kaido fight. I think the fighting is going to start on egghead, but the strawhats are going to have to take the battle to Elbaf for one reason or another. Like at Marineford, the marines see Shanks and retreat. Seeing that shanks killed Kidd, it's a bitter reunion. \n\nThis one's a stretch but since supernovas are meeting with emperors right now. Urouge and Buggy are meeting on a sky island nearby. We know how that's gonna go... More members for the cross guild. \n\nOther pieces of information that I think are going to become important very soon: Shirahoshi is Poseidon. Sengoku has said that the Gura-Gura no mi (tremor tremor fruit) could destroy the world. The Toki Toki no Mi (time time fruit) returned into circulation roughly 20 years ago. And Doflamingo is a celestial dragon, so there's no way he's still locked up.  \n\nAlright, I'm glad I'm not the author cause this kinda sucks, but it's my contribution to break week. All thoughts, insults, and arguments are greatly appreciated and encouraged! Thanks for coming to my TED talk.",

        "text": "I don't usually look at theories since I'm anime only and don't wanna get spoiled, but Id thought Id try my hand at one.\n\n* **Marineford** \n\nDuring Marineford BB goes under a cloth to steal WB’s fruit. When this happens, Shiryu states, \"If this fails we will have to disband”. So we can safely assume BB’s commanders know what he’s doing and probably how. We also could assume. that BB is doing something pretty vile that would cause concern for their public image.\n\n* **Dressrosa**\n\nIn Dressrosa, Jesus Burgess tries to steal the Gum-Gum fruit from Luffy and the Flare-Flare from Sabo. His two attempt with this is with a blade. I've seen people say that only BB's power allows him to steal fruits, if this was the case, why would Jesus jump at them with just a blade and the intention of taking the fruits himself?\n\n(Here's the biggest evidence for this theory)\n\n* **WCI**\n\nIn Big Mom's flashback, we see her celebrate her birthday with Mother Carmel and the other orphans. We know that Mother Carmel had the Soul-Soul fruit before Big Mom. During the celebration, it is **heavily** implied that Big Mom eats Mother Carmel and the orphan kids. We can assume this because of the Giant who goes pale after the incident and runs away and Streusen calling her a monster. Not to mention the destroyed property and scattered clothes of the victims. Almost immediately after, kinda like after BB left from under the tarp, we see Big Mom using the Devil Fruit abilities of another character who is dead. Where am I going with this? **Cannibalism**\n\n* **Theory**\n\nMy theory is the way the Blackbeard Pirates \"steal\" Devil Fruits is by taking/eating their victim's hearts. Blackbeard does this to Whitebeard in Marineford and hides under the tarp because of the public backlash/distraught of him eating whitebeard's heart. Burgess in Dressrosa tries to carve out Luffy and Sabo's hearts in order to steal their fruits, and Big Mom eats Mother Carmel whole, absorbing her Devil Fruit in the process. Assuming cannibalism is the answer, the reason I say the heart and not any other body part is that Whitebeard wasn't missing any limbs, and if was the brain his head would be gone. I've seen people say that it's the Dark-Dark fruit that steals other people's fruit. If this was the case, why would Jesus try to steal fruits on his own in Dressrosa, and how would Big Mom immediately be able to use Mother Caramel's power?\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nThe Blackbeard Pirates take/eat people's hearts in order to steal their power. BB hid it from the world in the tarp he was in, Jesus tried to take Luffy/Sabo's power with a dagger in Dressrosa, and Big Mom ate Mother Carmel and was able to use her power.",
