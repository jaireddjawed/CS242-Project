        "text": "[Drinker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ08mzxQSDQ): It's tough to think of any Hollywood actor who's had more of a raw deal than Brendan Fraser. Over the years the guy was one of the biggest up-and-coming stars of the 90s and early 2000s with a string of hit movies under his belt and a natural flair for comedy and action that served him well in movies like “The Mummy” and “George of the Jungle”.  \n\nBut unfortunately for him an unsavoury encounter with a sleazy Hollywood executive saw him getting blacklisted from top level productions. Resulting in a string of flops that killed his box office momentum. An expensive divorce settlement added to his financial problems, forcing him to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars a year that he couldn't affords. And if that wasn't bad enough years of doing his own stunt work finally caught up with him, resulting in crippling back problems that required extensive surgery to correct.  \n\nBasically Brendan kinda got fücḳ over by both life and Hollywood and it seemed like he was destined to become just another cautionary tale about the pursuit of fame. Another hopeful young actor who got chewed up and spat out by the Hollywood machine.  \n\nBut if there's one thing that people love it's a good comeback story and truly Brendan Fraser's comeback has been nothing short of inspirational. A string of successful TV appearances in the late 2010s began to re-establish him as a viable actor. Public interest began to increase and people began talking about the Brenaissance and it all culminated in his Oscar winning role in the whale.  \n\nDarren Aronofsky's psychological drama a bit of morbidly obese English tutor trying to reconnect with his estranged daughter in the final days of his life. It doesn't exactly sound like an inspiring setup for a movie but holy ṣhiṭ, it's proof that the right actor can absolutely make or break a film. Elevating what could be a fairly pedestrian bit of pity porn into something genuinely special and moving. It's a film that I have to admit I only got around to watching a few days ago but I'm very glad that I finally did and I knew that I just had to talk about it so here goes.  \n\n“The Whale” stars Fraser as Charlie a massively overweight and reclusive English tutor, who teaches online courses from his ramshackle apartment, always making sure to keep his webcam off.  \n\nHe's divorced and basically house-bound now and his only real interactions are with his carer Liz and a pizza delivery guy that he never actually meets face to face. And straight away the film makes no attempt to glamorize Charlie's life in the slightest. The very first time we see him, he's in his chair having a good old chug to some porn on his laptop.  \n\nUnfortunately his years of compulsive eating are catching up with him. He's suffering from heart failure and he knows he doesn't have long left to live. Liz wants him to go to hospital but he keeps refusing with the excuse that he can't afford the medical bills. Instead he manages to coax his estranged daughter to spend time with him, bribing her with the promise of his life savings after he's gone.  \n\nNeedless to say their interactions don't go well at first. She's angry and embittered with him for abandoning her, disgusted by his physical appearance and basically suffers through their meetings so that she can get his money at the end. But the more time they spend together, the more she slowly begins to open up about the grief and hurt that she feels towards him and the more we learn about Charlie's own past.  \n\nHe left his marriage to start a relationship with one of his students and when the guy eventually took his own life it started him on a self-destructive spiral of obsessive overeating that slowly killing him now.  \n\nAnd when the truth of his hidden money that he's been using to bribe his daughter comes to light, it threatens to tear apart what little life he has left.  \n\nAs a Storyteller Darren Aronofsky's got a bit of a thing for flawed and self-destructive characters locked into an addictive relationship with the very thing that's ruining their lives. Whether it's “Requiem for a Dream” dealing with drugs and vanity or “The Wrestler” pushing himself to breaking point rather than let go of the past and move on to a new stage in life, or “Black Swan” driving its main character into a spiral of madness and obsession. They all tackle the self-destructive nature of what it means to be human. But I don't think it's ever been hammered home quite as forcefully as “The Whale”.  \n\nCharlie is an absolutely pitiful character, a broken man caught in an escalating spiral of shame, addiction and self-loathing. Unable or unwilling to change his ways and refusing help from everyone who tries to save him from himself. Whether it's Liz who tries to help him out as a friend and a nurse or an idealistic missionary out to save his soul or even his ex-wife who still has some shred of love and compassion towards him. The more the film progresses the more his condition slowly deteriorates, as he loses the ability to walk stand up or even breathe unaided and the more desperate he becomes to redeem himself in his daughter's eyes. And their interactions form the dramatic heart of the story.  \n\nHe's a dying man, trying to reconnect with the daughter he hasn't seen in years, a bad father trying to atone for past mistakes, a flawed human being at the end of a life not particularly well lived, trying to get just one thing right before he goes.  \n\nA different movie would have developed a more conventional saccharine kind of relationship between them. The initial weariness and distrust given way to companionship love and mutual understanding. But what's interesting about “The Whale” is that it never really happens that way. Ellie's angry cruel and spiteful throughout most of the movie. Making no secret of the fact that she hates them and just wants him to die so that she can inherit his money. She's not some compassionate angel who just wants to help him out she's a hard and abrasive character and she ended up that way because of Charlie's actions. And probably the closest they come to reconnecting is a big emotional blowout where she finally drops the facade and lets out all that pent up anger and hurt towards him.  \n\nIt's an awesome performance from actress Sadie Sink, who really puts everything she has into the role. Yeah you could probably argue that it's pretty similar to Max from “Stranger Things”, but what the hell, if it ain't broke don't fix it I guess. But by far the best aspect of “The Whale” is Brendan Fraser himself, who delivers the best work of his entire career with this one unfair play to the guy for taking on a challenging and risky part like this. The whole thing could have gone horribly wrong in the hands of a different actor.  \n\nBut Fraser absolutely sells every single moment as Charlie. From his submissive apologies to Liz as she fights a losing battle to help him, to his painful admissions of his own shortcomings as a husband and father, to his defiant defence of the love that he once shared in the face of religious prejudice, it's all great stuff that absolutely captivates your attention.  \n\nAnd make no mistake, this isn't a glamorous role for any actor watching his physical deterioration throughout the movie is almost painful at times. His disgusting binge eating will be enough to put you off the very concept of food and the moments where he comes face to face with the reality of what he's become are both sobering and tragic. And big props to the makeup department here. If you didn't know what the actor looked like beforehand you'd swear he really was this big.  \n\n“The Whale” copped a lot of flack over its depiction of obesity and binge eating and there's even some aṡṡhóles on social media who got mad that they didn't cast an actual six hundred pound actor for the main role, in a movie where the protagonist is literally dying because of how big he is. This is why we can't have nice things ladies and gentlemen.  \n\nBut the thing is though, people like that are really missing the point of the film.It's not a story about obesity specific. Charlie could just as easily be addicted to drugs or alcohol or anything else that can slowly destroy you. It's a movie about self-destruction, mistakes regrets grief and a search for redemption. It's not exactly a fun or uplifting experience and by the end you'll be feeling almost as claustrophobic as the protagonist. But it's definitely a compelling and thought-provoking movie that landed its main character a well-deserved Oscar win.  \n\nAnd if you haven't got a chance to see it yet then the Drinker highly recommends you give the whale a couple of hours of your time anyway that's all I've got for today. Go away now",

Writing and directing are to blame. The writing is filled with platitudes. It’s especially egregious in the Soviet Union, a grey world that feels ripped from a new Star Wars movie. There’s little nuance here. We’ve got the corrupt Russian agent, the oversized billionaire in a bowtie, his douchebag son who flies around on jets drinking champagne. The characters are so simple they’re boring. Even the protagonist (played well) lacks intrigue. \n\nAnd the film leans into these characters in a way that distracts from the fascinating story beats they’re involved in—a three-way race to acquire international Tetris rights to distribute across multiple types of consoles. If the writer wants to turn a great story into a character study, he could at least make his characters two dimensional. Instead, we leave almost surprised to learn that anything in the movie was based on a true story. That’s how unrealistic it felt. \n\nDirecting was drab and lifeless, though there were some creative uses of Tetris graphics throughout. Overall, I was ready to walk out by halftime.",

So, inspired by [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GthjKWYMeU), I have an idea for a game: let's all do fancasts for movie adaptations of cartoons (or video games), but with flavor-of-the-month celebrities chosen purely because they're big names as the voices of the characters! The one rule is that you are allowed to include ONE of the original voice actors - only one - as the \"See? See? We kept ONE of the original voice actors, that TOTALLY means we care about these characters, right?\" casting choice (a la Frank Welker as Scooby in *Scoob!*, Tress MacNeille as Gadget in the Chip 'n' Dale movie, Charles Martinet's cameos in the Mario movie). Everyone else must be a miscast celebrity making no effort to sound like the actual characters. I'll start us off...\n\n***The Flintstones***  \n\\- Nick Offerman as Fred Flinstone  \n\\- Jim Gaffigan as Barney Rubble  \n\\- Maya Rudolph as Wilma Flintstone  \n\\- Sofia Vegara as Betty Rubble (literally just doing Gloria from *Modern Family* in a Betty Rubble costume)  \n\\- Kaley Cuoco as Pebbles Flintstone  \n\\- Bobby Moynihan as Bamm-Bamm Rubble  \n\\- Chris Rock as Dino (either he just does dog noises or Dino actually talks and is literally just Chris Rock as a dinosaur)  \n\\- Marc Maron as Mr. Slate  \n\\- Tom Holland as the Great Gazoo (because, hey, he's British, right?)\n\nThe various animals that serve as appliances would all be voiced by random internet celebrities (YouTubers, TikTok stars, etc.).",

I have ADHD myself but the editing style catered a little too much to that condition. It reminded me too much of the frantic storytelling style that Rick and Morty has.\n\nAnyway the fucking rock scene. When it first appeared I thought it was going to be a throwaway scene. Aww cute, it's just silent and they're communicating with text just for this scene, and we'll never see them again. But then the climax started ramping up and suddenly you're attached to those rocks like they're people you've known all your life.\n\nMasterful writing and cinematography to make you, as a human being, feel a strong emotional attachment to ROCKS.",

As the mysterious killer claims more and more victims, Loretta attempts to continue her investigation alongside colleague and confidante Jean Cole.\n\n\n\n\n**Publication, Score= Review**    \n**The Daily Beast**, Rotten =It has one thing to say, and it says it over and over again with a dismal lack of nuance.  \n**AV Club**, C= The movie attempts to serve multiple narrative masters, but ends up coming across as vague and indistinct.\n\n**TheWrap**, Fresh= “Boston Strangler” may muddle its facts, but its message never wavers. In a genre dominated by perfunctory intrigue, how exhilarating to see a film with morals this clear, consistent, and touching.\n\n**Mashable**, Rotten= \"These women — their deaths, their names, their lives, their pain — are regarded by the camera as little more than a morbid spectacle, which is jarring against the film's supposed message.\"\n\n**TVGuide**, 6/10= There is a life-threatening lack of oomph in the picture. Carrie Coon is the only spark, as the seen-it-all tough gal reporter with a \"screw you\" attitude.\n\n**Hollywood Reporter**, Fresh= Smart and powerfully understated.\n\n**New York Times**, Rotten= You don’t have to look further than the pedestrian title to guess that Matt Ruskin’s “Boston Strangler” is a spiritless affair.\n\n\n**Guardian**, 2/5= There is so little dramatic excitement to any of this. Where is the tension? Where is the suspense? Where is the macabre horror?\n\n\n**Slant Magazine**, 2.5/4= While the film’s determination to spotlight the women who brought down the Boston Strangler over the killer himself is admirable, it leaves a hole in the middle of the film that nothing else really manages to fill.\n\n**ScreenAnarchy**, Fresh= It's a crime drama, ticking away softly as events unfold. Some scenes unnerve, slowly, breathing in order to allow the impact to become clear. ... Keira Knightley gives her finest performance to date.\n\n\n**AwardsWatch**, B- = [Keira] Knightley, [Carrie] Coon, and [Chris] Cooper are a formidable cast, and it’s exciting to see another addition to the small canon of films about female journalists.\n\nRating: R  \n\nGenre: Crime, Drama  \n\nOriginal Language: English  \n\nDirector: Matt Ruskin  \n\nProducer: Tom Ackerley, Josey McNamara, Michael A.

They succeed (obviously) and the enemy ships come one by one out of some hyperspace jump and are destroyed. End film. God I can see scenes of this movie in my mind but have failed to come up with adequate search parameters to find the movie name. I'm hoping here this will take seconds..",

The fans wanted the mood and thrills of ALIENS. \n\nI also wish David Lynch embraced the movie. It's such a good effort for a first time director but I get why he hates the movie.

It’s surprise it to me, considering QT was speaking as though he were absolutely interested in bringing this project to life. However, it’s not like he wouldn’t also explore a bonus farewell film following this final film - or perhaps Kill Bill vol 3 would be the tv series he stated he was interested in doing?\n\nTo be clear, I think the Kill Bill legacy is flawless, and perfect as is. So if it really will never happen, I’m at peace with that, and still wholeheartedly look forward to his final film. However, we can’t deny that Nikkia v BB is something we’ve all wanted for a long time. And Maya Hawke playing an adult version of BB would’ve been so sick - Uma reprising her role as well, which she’s also expressed interest in.\n\nWhat are your theories?\n\nTLDR; With Quentin Tarantino’s final film being announced, is it time to say goodbye to the possibility of Kill Bill VOL 3?",
