        "text": "I'm beyond exhausted from a crazy day, so that's feeding into my anxiety I'm sure. And I was fine until the thought popped into my head which caused the anxiety settle on my chest. \n\nWe have these good friends who we haven't seen in a while. In fact, ever since we announced we were pregnant a few months back, they've gone quiet. Now I know she was trying to get pregnant with out any luck. She was also trying to finish up her nursing Degree so I know she's been stupid busy. She graduated a week or two ago. Every time I ask if they wanna hang out or if I can swing by and give her something, she tells me she's busy but makes no offer as to when she's not. I chalked it up the degree and work. \n\nToday, I ran into her and her dad at the mall. I said hi (she didn't see me at first) and she said hey back, in a surprised way, and then turned into the opening of the store &amp;amp; kept talking to her dad while looking at the display case. I could still see them and waited a moment. Said \"I haven't seen you in a while\" but she didn't even acknowledge it. She may not have heard me. I lingered a moment and then kept walking. I thought maybe she'd text me later but nothing. I told my husband and he commented that her husband had been weird too lately. \n\nSo now idk. I have no idea what I did to upset her to the point of distancing herself beside getting pregnant. It's heart breaking because we've known each other 10'years. I feel like I should message her but I'm also exhausted. Hopefully sharing here will help alleviate the anxiety a bit. \n\nUpdate: I messaged her last night, she read it and didn't respond. Got a response this am saying she didn't get the message until much later (hello read receipts?) and that she just had a lot going on masked if she was ok and needed to talk. She gave me a clipped short \"no. I'm fine\" answer. Told her I was here for her and how much we missed her and her husband. No response. This closed off, vague answers aren't like her and my feelings are hurt. I'm not gonna push it and I'll give her space but it does trigger a lot of my anxiety, sensory issues and ACoN stuff. So I'm just sad and hurt but I'm gonna give her time and space and hopefully she'll work through it and just come back when the time is right and talk. ",

        "text": "I have a friend I've known for about 10 years.  We were fairly close at one time, but have since drifted apart, and live in different states.  She chats with me occasionally through Facebook, but our chatting had been very sporadic until my husband passed away 2 years ago.  At the time of his passing, she seemed to be very sympathetic and supportive, but her support became suffocating:  sending me food I couldn't eat, books on grieving from a religious perspective that isn't mine, donations, cards to my sons with long messages (when she had never met them), unwanted advice, etc.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSince then, and my revelation that my parents are nparents, when I tried to discuss that with her, she just didn't seem to get it.  She tried to give me advice while saying things like \"I can't imagine what you're going through, I feel so sorry for you.\"  When she realizes she's upset me, she'll get super enthusiastic and find something to compliment me about, but it seems insincere and inappropriate.  If I tell her about something I'm struggling with, she'll jump in with how to fix it, even though she may know absolutely nothing about it.   \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHere's a sample of a chat, when we were discussing my nparents:\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nM: Grant's therapist recommended Grant *[M's cousin]* read the book. He did over a year ago &amp; said it was helpful. Not sure if it would be helpful to you or not.\n\nD: I don't know\n\nM: I obviously don't know either &amp; why I brought it up.\n\nD:I don't really need any reading suggestions right now\n\nM: Perhaps males have different symptoms than females. I'm clueless.\n\nD:I think you just might not be able to relate to where I'm coming from.\n\nM: Completely agree. I apologize\n\nD:This is something very personal and difficult.   And we've had this conversation before.\n\nM: I know It is, I know we have &amp; I apologize\n\nD: I need to ask this...why did you feel a need to offer suggestions as to what I should read with regards to emotional abuse?\n\nM: Not sure. I know I want to help in anyway I'm able &amp; it helped Grant.\n\nD: Its not helpful when a. You know nothing about it and b. I didn't ask for help\n\nM: Understood. I apologize. You're right, I don't. However, that doesn't mean the I don't care &amp; I support you in what you're going through. Wish I had a magic wand, crystal ball, pixie dust, whatever - to be able to make life better for you.  *[this last line in particular made me furious...I'm still not sure why]*\n\nD: For example, when I was really upset by having received a letter from my parents, you asked me what good things happened to me that day.\n\nM: What would you have preferred me to ask or not ask? I was hoping to interject some 'happiness' into your day. My bad\n\nD: I think you need to do a little research about empathy.  Just that you'd ask me that makes you seem like you don't like listening to someone expressing emotions and don't know how to handle them.\n\nM: I'm glad you're expressing to me how you'd like me to listen. Helpful\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThen a few months later:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nM: I want to apologize to you for not exhibiting empathy during our chats, Daisy_W. I honestly didn't know what to do except what I did. Thanks to you for letting me know. I've soul searched &amp; spoke with my therapist &amp; while I felt and continue to feel deep empathy for you, I didn't know what to say or do. For that, I'm very sorry.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo I've cut my chatting with her way down and only when she initiates it.  Our most recent conversation ended when she asked how I feel about my parents (whom she knows I'm NC with) and when I said I'm upset about the situation, she said \"Can't even begin to imagine how that feels. I'm feel so badly for you, Daisy_W.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis just irritates the hell out of me but I can't quite articulate why.\n",

        "text": "Apologies for posting so much recently - it just really helps to get my thoughts out of my head. \n\nSo far this holiday season seems to be much tougher than any in the past (and this will be my 3rd NC). \n\nI've been failing at life in general the past few weeks/month: failing at being a good partner (been so sad and emotional) failing at work (really struggling to concentrate) failing at my hobby (epic procrastination, and am a month late on something very important, and I've let people down). And I'm just generally feeling hugely overwhelmed. Everything feels impossible. \n\nSo, I've decided to accept it.  I used to have a very vociferous and harsh inner critic. I've shrunk the inner critic... and I think this is what has left me so apathetic now. Before, when I was miserable, the critic would kick in and write me huge To Do lists and bully me into completing the lists, and so I kept going at life.  I've tried writing the lists, and then they just sit there, and I don't tick anything off them, because the critic isn't there to bully me anymore. This is a strange feeling. I don't really feel like 'myself'.  I feel kind of powerless in a way - having lost that driving force.  I don't miss the critic's bullying. But I do hate this apathy and sadness. \n\nSo, yeah, I've decided to accept it.  I've decided to adopt \n[spoon theory](http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/). I feel rubbish, I have no motivation, and I can't force myself to feel better and feel motivated (I've tried, and I can't). So I've decided to accept I don't have many spoons just at the moment. I thought carefully, and I think I have about 3 spoons a day - 1 spoon for work, 1 spoon for household chores, and 1 spoon for anything else I need to do. \n\nSo, today, I have to go to work, I have to catch a train, and I have to pack a bag. That's it, that's my spoons for today.  I'm going to fail to do anything else today. And those people I've let down, I've still let them down, I don't have any more spoons today for them. I will have 1 spoon available for them tomorrow - and they'll get that spoon tomorrow, to the best of my ability. That's all I can do right now, that's all I have to give. And I'm going to try to be okay with that. Instead of beating myself up for not having enough spoons. \n\nI'm seeing SOs family this weekend. I'll only have the 1 spoon for them too. I probably wont be a great guest. They'll get the 1 spoon, and I'll be the best guest I can be with that 1 spoon I have to give, and I'm going to try to be okay with just having 1 spoon to give. ",

        "text": "Being deliberately vague about what I do. My job involves filling in at different sites. I am in a supervisory role on each occasion, but am only supervising the same people for a day at a time. There is what is probably a natural human tendency, on the part of the people I work with, to feel somewhat irritated that the person they are used to working with is not there, and they are stuck with somebody who doesn't know them or know all of the specifics of their site and who might not do everything the same way. \n\nThen also I am the kind of person who tends to be like \"get the job done\" rather than \"let's shoot the breeze and get to know each other\". I am a very hard worker but I don't make great first impressions. I don't schmooze and try to be everybody's buddy. \n\nI could go on. But basically the upshot of all of this ends up being that I've gotten several reviews that say variations of, I'm good at the procedural aspects of my job but not as good with people. Based, mostly, on stuff that the DM has heard from people who worked with me a handful of times. I'll ask for specifics and he'll bring me single statements I made that people took the wrong way. \n\nAnd I could just blow it all off and keep doing my job and decide if people have a problem with me I know I'm good at my job and I get results and that's what matters. But if I ever want to get placed at one site full time, where I can make connections with one team and they can get to know me and I can get to know them and we can each have a more complete feel for who the other person is, I have to make a good impression on those people, and on everybody they might talk to. \n\nI try to do things \"for the team\" like picking up shifts. I can't tell if it's helping my reputation at all. \n\nI don't think I could have designed a more frustrating work experience for an ACoN if I'd tried. \n\nAnyone else had to deal with anything like this?",

        "text": "I have a friend - one of my best friends since college - who likely has some N tendencies but who it seems just loves to be miserable.  She has been as close as a sister would be but I had to stop talking to her for a few years because I was trying to break away from my Nex after I found out about his first flurry of affairs and I needed support.  She told me essentially to call someone else - it was weird, long story, but I felt like I'd been there when she needed me; only a few months before, when I'd had a breakdown after learning of my Nex's extracurricular activities, I was on a plane and at her door 12 hours after she called me when her sister died, even though I was broke and going through my own emotional hell.  I felt really betrayed and couldn't pretend I wasn't deeply hurt.  \n\nI recently got a back in touch with her after about 5 years.  I've seen her once and we seemed to pick up where we left off friendship wise.  \n\nBut she seems to thrive on being unhappy.  I can understand being depressed about certain things, and have sympathy for what she's gone through.  BUT... \n\nShe would rather gripe about how miserable she is than take some very simple steps to start fixing her life.  She owns her house outright, she owns her car, she has tons of savings as the only  beneficiary when her parents died, she has a masters degree and years of professional experience, but is currently unemployed.  I've suggested temp work only to be told \"I don't want to go back into that field again.\" She got a second masters in a field she has no experience in, and can't find a job in the area around her home.  I told her if she was serious about her new career she might need to consider moving. \"I'm not leaving [town], I have too much else going on here.\"  \n\nAnd I've posted all about my current situation and won't here again. Suffice to say it's been hell, it's hard every day, I am doing what needs to be done, not what makes me happy or what I \"want to do...\" in short, I'm being a grown up and dealing with what needs to be done.  She's in no financial or personal distress, *could* work but won't, and won't do what she probably will have to do if she wants to use her new masters degree.  \n\nI don't know what to say to her when what I want to say is \"Grow the fuck up and just deal already.\"  So many people I know, myself included, have faced far greater challenges and just got the job done, or at least frickin tried.  \n\nI'm on the edge of cutting her out of my life again, I'm so frustrated.  I can't stand when someone prefers to wallow in their unhappiness rather than take very simple steps to make things better.\n\nWhen she's not being a martyr, she's actually a great friend and I truly enjoy talking to her.  But the cross she drags around is getting to be a bit much for me right now.",

I've always been aware of it but for some reason today it incensed me as never before.\n\nMy NMom had written me off while I was dating my first husband because I'd told GC/Flying Monkey brother something they'd done that bothered me, which he then reported to her.  I was 29 at the time (in my first year of practice after graduating law school), he was 40, she was 61, so none of us were children here.  I don't remember what it was but me being hurt by it and expressing that hurt caused her to write me a letter telling me how she'd always been proud of me but now could see I was just a selfish spoiled bitch and not to contact her again.  \n\nI was floored, but NMom had been changing after NDad's death.  I had been her unquestionable GC while NDad was alive, and had been her \"buddy\" against him.  She's more or less left my brothers to fend for themselves.  After my NDad died, she didn't need me in that capacity anymore, and she became jealous, demeaning, petty -- a complete 180 where I concerned.  My oldest brother was diagnosed with cancer, she moved him into her house and he became her GC and the cross upon which she was martyring herself daily.  She'd started becoming actively emotionally abusive, but the letter was a new peak for her (she'd do it again in a few years but that's another story).\n\nWhen we got engaged I reached out to her, as I thought she'd want to be involved. My NMom was a social butterfly, always the life of the party, everyone loved her -- except for my wedding and wedding planning.  She was curt, quiet, insulting and generally acted like me asking her to be present for an engagement party, bridal shower or rehearsal dinner was a huge burden to put on her.\n\nMy inlaws were bigwigs in their little town, MIL didn't have daughters so I gave her mostly free rein with the planning.  I didn't know she'd sent 400 invitations until a month before the wedding.  So this wasn't a small event; this was this little towns social event of the season.\n\nI more or less ignored my family the day of my wedding (except my oldest brother, who I dearly loved and was happy he was around to see me married - he died about a year later) and was having a pretty good time at my own reception when she cornered me, crying.  Saying how she felt she was losing me to another family, how much she loved me, how precious I was, blah blah blah.  \n\nThen she made me leave MY RECEPTION with over a hundred people at it to drive her to her back to her hotel.  I don't remember why I had to, and a friend followed me in her car to drive me back when I dropped off my mom and her car...\n\nI tell this story and usually think it's just a jerk move but today I was LIVID.  She tried like hell to rob me of my wedding day, the entire experience.  And when she saw that I wasn't going to be bereft of love and family had to assert that control.\n\nHad to get it off my chest. Thanks for reading!",

I basically started over in my 30's! This newer job has taught me a lot but it doesn't pay the bills (it's half the salary of my first job), super intense, and inconsistent (that's the best word for it). But I feel like Ive done the job well, but it's time for better pay, better insurance, and more stability with baby #2 on the way!\n\nSo, I applied to another job 2 months ago and finally heard back last week (its a state job, so apparently thats the norm). I have my interview tomorrow. I have received verbal recommendations to the hiring director from two ladies in this agency that I've collaborated with in my current job. I also have 5 or so written letters of recommendation from previous co-workers and supervisors in my old field as it pertains to my new field. I have my transcripts for both master's degrees (including the one in progress), resume and cover letter all in folders to give the panel. So, now I just have to figure out what I wear (to rock the baby bump or not?? lol).\n\nThis job would help alleviate a lot of financial problems in our life right now and offer us more stability. So, it's a big effing deal. I feel good about it and know i can give a great interview. I know they are interviewing others too. Makes me a little nervous but I know state law says they have to interview so many people before offering a job.\n\nAnyways, this is my christmas/Hanukah wish! Just wanted to share it with you guys! I am turning my terrible childhood into a career when I can be an advocate for others. Turning good into bad. Now, I just need this job!!!!\n\nUpdate: interview went really well. I was the first one and was in there for 40 min. They seemed to be impressed with my portfolio and answers (they took a lot of notes). They had 3 more that day and another group next week. With the holiday coming up and the bureaucratic hoops, they said it could be a couple weeks before I heard anything. Sounds like they have at least 2 openings so I feel good! Thanks for the support!

Or telling me I was making it up, or if I just acted normal...well, I'm sure you all understand.   \n\nBut when something good happened, like the time I was shocked for making the honor roll, she'd say things like \"Don't let that go to your head.\"  \n\nIn school I reassured myself by getting good grades and keeping my weight down.  That's all I knew how to do.  In adult life those things don't matter *that* much.   I have no idea what healthy reassurance is or is supposed to look like.\n\nOh, it is one of those days where being raised by wolves just makes me so sad.  \n\n",

        "text": "So my possible n grandma (mother to my nfather) has been pretty pissed off at me over being NC with my parents. At first I confided in her and then she showed her n colors and shared that info with my parents who are so willing to play the victim. My nfather plays her like a fiddle. So I've backed off. \n\nSo now, my only grandmother and I only speak maybe once every 3 months for 5 min. I've had to hang up on her a few times the last few phone calls to establish boundaries. It's just heartbreaking but expected at this point. I also haven't seen her in a year or so. I'm pregnant again and idk if she'll even try to see her newest grandchild (when I told her I was pregnant her first thought was over my parents, not a new life). \n\nSo we spoke for 30 seconds on thanksgiving and haven't spoken to her since. I emailed her and my aunt (my only good family member) our Christmas lists. We're super broke right now so I said that  we can't afford to get them gifts and would understand if they didn't want to send us (the adults) any. \n\nLooks like they're just sending gifts to my son. My aunt and I discussed it &amp; are spotty about gift giving bc of our newly repaired relationship but my grandma always sends me birthday and Christmas gifts. She only has 3 grandchildren (&amp; 4 step grandchildren whom I bet are all getting gifts). She's decided to not send us gifts it seems this year. She's hasn't come out and said it but my aunt said they're only sending gifts for my son. \n\nI expected this so I'm not upset. I had hoped she still would step up (didn't expect her to) so I'm just slightly disappointed in her. Just really confirms the reality of our relationship. She's pissed at me and I gave her an out present wise. \n\nAnd it's not about the gift per say, it's about her being a grandmother who always does grandmother things. I'm weird about gifts bc of my nparents who taught me to equate love and attention with gifts. Working to over come that but you can imagine my expected disappointment in my NGrandma. It is what it is. Glad I didn't waste my $ on them",

        "text": "I need to get this off my chest. I'm not sure where to start so I'm just gonna go at it. Gonna try to make it as short as possible.\n\n\nI've been NC with all NFam for over 2 years now (confetti!) and the sibling I speak to who had the last ties to them went NC just a few months ago. I'm in my mid-20s.\n\nMy first peace came when I finally got distance from the NFam almost 4 years ago when my now-spouse and I moved into our own home. The distance was far enough that they couldn't just drop by unannounced and I was beyond grateful. There are no words for the sanctuary I felt.\n\nThe first few years here, though, flew by so fast... I did have interaction with my friends but for the most part I would be at home by myself. This past year I've personally progressed to where I'm more involved with the world around me. When I look back I do my best not to regret it because I needed that time to just heal. There was a lot I couldn't handle and didn't completely understand though I knew I was on the pathway to healing just by getting away. This was before I even realized having PTSD was a possibility.\n\n\nI had a really physically violent, psychologically and emotionally turbulent childhood and upbringing, barely understood myself or what my life was or the people in it up until a few years ago, then fast-forward to now... All the sudden I'm in my mid-20s and... I just can't help but feel like my youth was robbed from me. All those years even as a kid just panning to the back of my head to make it through every day, just letting life happen and floating through... Then moving here, and it's like the next day I'm a few years older and I (almost) feel like I'm awake for the first time...\n\n\nSo here's what *really* bothers me... After I feel like I've barely gotten grounds on myself and my life, I'm hit in the ears with the sound of my biological clock ticking away- I'm not a kid, not a teenager; I'm a young woman. If you were to ask me offhand if I want kids, my answer is yes, because I believe at the end of the day, I really do...\n\n\nSometimes, though, I feel cheated regarding life... That's a very lame attitude, I know... But... All the sudden it's time to have kids. And I get scared because I don't want to harbor bitterness against our kids when we do have them, because the thought reminds me of my NDad, especially a conversation he had half-yelling at my sibling: \"ONE DAY I'M A TEENAGER RIDING MY BIKE TO SCHOOL, AND THE NEXT DAY I HAVE KIDS.\" I felt like such an estranged burden of sorts... Then there's my NMom... We were more like puppies or accessories than children to her... She did mom things when she felt like it.\n\n\nChildren are not accessories. They are not obligations. They are not status. They are not pets. They are not merely your \"legacy.\" **They are tiny human beings that are the result of you and another. They're a new life with eyes and ears and a heart that will one day be a fully grown human. It is another life that you made. It's a child.** These things I remind myself of.\n\n\nThat being said, I do definitely look fondly on having kids one day... But I'm caught in a whirlwind right now... I don't want to accuse my innocent offspring of taking my life from me or some other bitter bullcrap... I won't have that. \n\n\nI do plan on going to a psych soon regarding this. Obviously my head is up in the air right now... Thank you so much for reading.\n\n\nEdit: Thank you so much to everyone who responded. These responses have helped me and I do feel better about certain things now. Everything is in due time and you just do the best you can. ",

        "text": "[Link here to first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/3wo792/his_parents_showed_up_at_my_sons_school/)\n\nThanks to everyone on first thread for all the advice. It took me until today to pluck up the courage to call the police (PTSD is a bitch). \n\nThe copper that came out heard from my son himself that he doesn't yet want to see his grandparents, that he doesn't want them just showing up at school.\n\nWe also discussed all the bullshit that they've been told with regards the state of the house and so on. He laughed and said he wished his house was this clean, but still, had a guided tour just to point out that the beds are clean and free of cat shit.\n\nHe took a whole history and we discussed, with my son, the potential way forward. I've asked for him to pass on my email address. I will not make the first move, I am not ready or prepared to talk on the telephone and I don't trust them with my information as they'll pass it onto N-Ex. If they want to see my son, we need to talk, perhaps even through mediation. They need to contact me in order to go forward.\n\nHe is calling them either tonight or tomorrow night. He is telling them that under no circumstances should they show up at the school again. My son has told him he only wants them there if he has asked them to go along. He is also going the extra mile and telling them that regardless of what N-Ex has said, it is my son who has been and still is refusing contact, not me that is not allowing it. \n\nHe is also reporting back on the house, that it's clean, tidy, well kept and any reports of filth etc from N-Ex is purely malicious.\n\nThe report will go to social services so I won't make the call there, they will have it logged and contact me if they feel they need to. I have yet to call my solicitor but I'm not sure a letter is warranted after this, maybe if they ignore the police but I'll see what he suggests.\n\nFingers crossed, a bit of truth will calm them a little and that police involvement will scare them enough to keep them from any more 'surprise' visits. It also seems my N-Ex is going to get a little warning too, but I'm not sure what's happening there.\n\nAgain, thanks to everyone for the support and encouragement. Without it, I'd have still been worrying about what to do and going around in circles. I'll keep you updated!\n\n",

        "text": "So I'm finally away from my Ndad and his N family, I have a lovely little life with my Fiance and Daughter. My dad physically and emotionally abused me, turned my friends against me and tried to make out he was the victim when I finally go out of his control. His family encouraged him, and have often told me in the past that parents can treat their children how they like. I've also been accused of being cruel for cutting my dad out of my life. \n\nThe problem is my dads family just will not leave us alone and they seem intent on finding my daughter and turning her against us. They seem to be winning.\n\nI live in the UK, so laws are different to the US here - no grandparental rights for a start. This can make life both easier and more difficult for us. My fiances parents live on the same side of town as my NDad and his family, in fact they live next-but-one (NBO) to my grandparents (dads parents). This is making things hard - my GM is disabled, and is housebound unless someone helps her out of the house. This generally means if I go to my ILs I'll get a text from my GM asking about seeing my daughter, I obviously ignore the text and GM hasn't seen my daughter since she was 2 weeks old (She's 6months on 28/12). Due to being NBO to ILs my Gm has pestered my MIL to let her see my daughter, thankfully MIL knows how I've been treated, doesn't like them herself and refuses to let them see my daughter.\n\nIt's recently come to head (through my brother who still talks to them all) that my dads  family are willing to do everything possible to \"get (daughters name) back as part of the family\", my dad told me before I left the family home that he hopes my daughter treats me the same as I treated him and that she tries to find him when she's older. I know my uncles have been to prison and wouldn't mind going again, I'm scared they'll take her, and I'll never see her again or she'll not be the same baby. Of course I've been to the police about this, but as there's so many of them and they all band together that I just look insane when they deny it.\n\nSo I've stopped my daughter going over to ILs house, which is meaning she's not spending time with her adoring grandparents - who would happily look after her for me if I ever needed a break or to catch up on housework.\n\nBut they've stepped up a rank. I went to the shop last night on my own, my daughter was asleep in her bed at home with my fiance playing games on his computer in the next room - perfectly happy to sort her out if she needed attention. While I was out I spotted my cousin from my dads family, she has a baby 10 days older than mine - her daughter was with her (Now we're talking 7pm at night when baby should be in bed at home). She saw me out without my baby and immediately accused me of leaving her home alone, and told me she was reporting me to social services because of it - I'm not worried if she does report me, I hadn't done anything wrong, my fiance is a perfectly capable parent and was happy to let me shop in peace. What I find angering is that my cousin, who apparently used to like me, sticks her nose in my business. I have severe depression and anxiety issues partially because of NDad, and a comment like that not only makes me feel rubbish but could easily send my backwards in the progress I've been making.\n\nDue to where this cousin lives with her child we're already considering sending our daughter to the non-local school as otherwise the girls could end up in the same class (the school set based on age) and I'm worried once my dads family know where my child is they'll take her. It also means they can't influence her through my cousins child as they'll not be at the same school until they reach age 13.\n\nSeriously, wish they'd leave me alone. It's getting complicated and annoying. We're considering moving but don't see why his family should push us out of our home and away from our friends and fiances family, although it's still a strong possibility.",

I saw a rainbow that morning, so I was attempting to keep my spirits up all Friday, though my co-workers always make it hard. These things really helped me get into a happier state of mind.\n\nThere were fewer people in this class than the Monday class, so that was nice. Also a new instructor, who was very friendly and helpful. She would go over all the more complicated moves slowly first, then speed up to tempo when everyone seemed to get it.\n\nAnd LAN, I had so much fun. I smiled, laughed and danced mildly well. The new instructor made me feel so comfortable! The rest of the group was having fun, and we even did made up dances that went to Christmas music. I think I will always go to the Friday one to get pumped for the weekend.\n\nIt was nice to finally not feel so stupid, not saying that thought didn't creep up in my mind a few time. But instead of letting it get me down, I just tried to ignore that mean little voice in my head and have fun. This time around I did not cry, and I did not feel sad so that's good.\n\nHowever tonight's class will be different, hopefully my good Friday experience will push me to be happier today!\n",

        "text": "hi guys,\n\n\ni read a lot about stalker parents who refuse to respect boundaries. ACONs who have to try really hard to enforce NC.\n\n\nmy father never had any interest in a relationship with me. i went to boarding school (moved out) at age 15, and he never once called me to talk. i pointed this out, explained i wanted a relationship, and he said what he always said \"your mother and i are the same, just talk to her. (i'm not interested.)\" my mother called me every day to bully me long distance, and at some point, 2 or 3 years ago, wanted to start NC with me. i freaked out. i begged and begged for her to let me back into a relationship with her. i didn't have any friends, my relationship was horrible - partially because i was way more interested in the relationship with my mother. she has always loved to call me a failure, gaslight me, curse at me, and then dramatically hang up after announcing that she's devoted too much time to talking to me. so she tried to establish NC, and then hung up on me. so i called over and over, she unplugged the phone.\n\n\nmany people over the years had pointed out to me that at any point i could have just stopped talking to her when she was bullying, or just stopped taking her calls. or stopped calling her. and i felt that this was not an option, in that i'm-terrified-she-will-beat-me-even-though-she's-hundreds-of-miles-away kind of way.\nanyway, eventually she let me back, and spoke to me again. meaning she bullied me and attacked me every single time we spoke. and then, i established NC. and she did not give half a shit. she didn't argue, has not tried to contact me in any way. it's been 11 months.\n\n\nto be clear, this has been the easiest year of my life, because she has not been in it. and i am not about to give up NC. but it makes me feel sad. my parents and their son who they never beat or gaslighted, who my father has interest in, and who never got sick and therefore does very well academically, are now the perfect family that they always should have been. they never wanted me.\n\n\nhas anyone else had this experience?",

        "text": "I don't know if you guys have been paying a lot of attention to RBN, but [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3wmuzm/updateprogress_for_the_first_time_i_stopped_one/) is me. Well, not literally. But the OP in that thread has described the pattern of my friendships. \n\nHi, it's me again. The one with the favourite senior colleague. I think she thinks we're friends. She is certainly acting like it. But my...whatever you call it, that instinct the parents trained into us, it's telling me now that she's only acting that way to \"be nice\". That anything I do has to be perfect or else it'll irritate her, and of course she won't show anything outwardly, but she's quietly building up resentment and it's going to explode right when I don't need it to. And I'm pulling away, and worrying that that's only giving her more ammunition. This thing has reached stage two of my typical interpersonal relationship. \n\nStage one is the honeymoon phase. We get along, feel each other out, enjoy chatting, all the new person things. Stage two is where I start to think I'm unwelcome. It's all well and good to have some fun, but don't I start to wear on you, just a little? \n\nI'd like to think we could be friends, but friends would involve you actually knowing me, and I'm quite sure you wouldn't like what you see, and how am I supposed to reciprocate your opening up without pushing you away? Because I really do enjoy your company. I appreciate that you want to get closer, but of course you don't understand that if you do, it'll only result in losing even what little we have. Problem is, even if I try to keep our small friendship - doesn't it wear on you, that I refuse to get closer? You're confused, you're trying, but I literally can not resolve your confusion and have it work out for the better. Or worse, you're not confused and you don't want to try, but you're too polite to tell me to go away. \n\nNo matter which way I play it, this game is not winnable. So stage two is where I decide whether it's worth trying to keep the friendship in spite of that. There are a few distinct ways this stage manifests: either I think you don't care and you're just playing nice, or I think you won't like me if I open up, or I'm afraid of wearing out my welcome, becoming a nuisance, and having you stop wanting my company. \n\nThere are exceptions. But if, in the course of our interactions, you haven't shown that what we have matters to you, and matters more than the small irritations and bothers that come with any interpersonal relationship, then I assume you were just here for a good time and I should probably leave soon. Or, if you matter enough to me, I ask for verbal confirmation that it's reciprocated. What this does is solidify the two possible outcomes: either you were truthful, and we survive stage two. Or you were lying, in which case you are not the kind of person I want as a friend anyway. But for the most part, after reaching stage two, potential friends end up in the zone of friendly acquaintances. \n\nSo there you have it. I'm in stage two right now with my favourite senior colleague. I want to come out of it on her good side. If at all possible I want to come out of it with her believing we're friends. (Whether we actually are is not relevant, since I am able to make myself believe a lie when I need it to be the truth. My priority here is a pleasant work environment in which I learn a lot and do good work, and a good reference for my next job. Real friendship would be a bonus. Hell, maybe my attitude in these parentheses precludes it...that's an acceptable price in my opinion.) \n\nI'm no longer quite sure what I'm asking. Maybe I want to know some concrete steps I can take to achieve my desired outcome, since (for assorted mercenary reasons) I'd like to keep this friendship. Maybe it's a question: how do you work through stage two? Maybe it's a cry for help: who knows how many friends I've lost because I don't trust, and how many more will it take? Or maybe I'm just afraid she doesn't like me, and I'm working out the stress by putting it in words and giving it to the internet. ",

        "text": "Last year I decided to commit suicide. Then, feeling pragmatic, I decided instead to simply cut out all the bad parts of my life-- an *effective* suicide. This was before I knew what \"NC\" was. I'd say it was helpful in my recovery, but that's dishonest: It was the beginning of my recovery.\n\nI quit my job. I cut off my family. I stopped talking to my friends. I thought if I could start over, I'd not only get better but I would rediscover empathy in others.\n\nI did get better: Marvelously, wonderfully better. I felt like a student driver who had just discovered the accelerator pedal. My health and happiness rapidly improved, to the point where I got comments on it nearly every time my old contexts collided with my new life.\n\nBut I never found empathy in others. It's like a brick wall. Blood from a stone. I feel like I'm hunting Bigfoot.\n\nDo people actually experience or practice empathy? I've searched for it in others but I've never seen it. There's always another reason for doing something that seems outwardly empathetic. I don't mean this in the cynical \"Oh, you did it and felt good? Then you're just doing it because it feels good!\" -- No, I don't think people feel even that. I think *sympathy* is real. Imagining yourself experiencing something bad isn't the same as truly empathizing though.\n\nI feel like I'm in a boat, probing for the bottom of the river with my paddle. And no matter how far down I stick the paddle, it's just not there. There *is no bottom*. I feel like I could drain the river and there'd just be a gaping abyss there. I could shout, scream and cry into it all I wanted, but there would never be any indication of a bottom. I could jump in but I'd just fall forever.\n\nI think, in our youth, we're built a sympathy bridge, which functions sort of like empathy would, if it were real. I think that's what I feel-- I don't think it's any more real than the \"utterly certain\" religious feelings I felt in my youth. It's just more *me* thoughts dressed up as empathy. Empathy that, again, is only \"there\" towards the all-important and all-encompassing end of flattering myself. Which just isn't something I'm interested in anymore (thanks, RBN!).\n\nI know there's an observer effect in play here. I can imagine people practicing empathy on their own without anyone watching. But I can't really see it for myself. It seems like somewhere, I'd be in a position to experience a glimpse of true empathy in another person. But it's never happened.\n\nI don't know if this is a product of my ACoN-ness. Or of my inner/outer critic.\n\nI feel like I got better but the world didn't. And won't.\n\nI still have rough patches. During those I feel like I could cry out for help as loud as possible and it wouldn't matter. I could kill myself and the narcs would just show up at my funeral and say things like \"This is so surprising!\" and \"I had no idea!\" It will never be about me even a little bit for as long as I live-- and even past that.\n\nI used to just think the world *didn't* care about me. Oddly enough, I was mostly okay with that. Now I think the world *can't*. That's a different beast.\n\nAt least before, I wanted to kill myself. At least before I wanted something. Now I don't want anything. Another day living seems tedious but I'm similarly unenthusiastic about dying.\n\nI used to think there were two models of communication and thought. Peer and rival. Peers wanted to work together to build something. Rivals wanted to work against each other and tear things down. Everyone had a little of each, I thought, and maybe some leaned more heavily towards one or the other.\n\nI don't think peer is real. I don't think empathy is real. I don't think people do anything *for* something but only against. There are no good motivators, only bad.\n\nDo I spend the rest of my life chasing the stupid things that seem to make other people happy? I've tried reaching out and helping others but it seems like the world is disgusted by even that. I've tried lots of things but it just seems like there's nothing there.\n\nDo I just pick something I hate and work against that? Do I call *that* good and just say the thing I'm working against is bad? It seems like all the details are arbitrary as long as the *us vs. them* template is adhered to.\n\nI don't think narcissism and ACoN are different things. One is a cocoon and one is a butterfly. Was my recovery too late? Is my outlook on the world just broken?\n\nIs there any place in the world that I could go and feel a sense of belonging?",

When she was 19, our cousin was hospitalized for having a lupus flare up. My sister decided it was the perfect time to say she \"attempted suicide.\" No evidence of an attempt was found, and she was put in the psych ward but discharged after a week. \n5 years later, she gets married in a hurry and she isn't that great of a planner, so she impulsively gets 2 dogs of restricted breeds, one of which is violent, and moves into my mother's house because she can't find a place to live (the only thing stopping her was the dog breeds). So I move out because I'm afraid of her dogs and her trying to kill me (she's tried before). I move into my (then) bf's apartment. She tried to sell one of my pets (who I was trying to find a home for and was keeping at my mother's house until I found it a home; I was told this was my responsibility only) and almost gave it away behind my back. There's more but that's enough for context. \n\nI have since cut all contact with her. and I'm a lot healthier without her in my life. \nBut she doesn't ever stop sucking up to my mother and our uncle. My mother pities her for having a mental illness and lets her get away with everything. My uncle is the same way. \nSaid uncle is in town and I have a feeling that he is going to mention something about me needing to reconcile with my sister. She pulls the pity card every single time he's in town. No doubt because she wants the attention and she wants a scene. \n\nI honestly can't figure out for the life of me why she tries to weasle in via our relatives. Majority of our family has abandoned her because she is vile and now only my mother and uncle speak to her. It's getting to the point where I might have to cut contact with my uncle because I know he's going to say something eventually. I have never received an apology from her for anything that she's ever done to me. She's one of the main reasons why I have PTSD and an anxiety disorder. \nI've worked hard to manage my mental illnesses and become successful in my personal and professional life. But for some reason, my elders cannot respect that I don't want to hear anything about her because she's toxic and destructive (despite my numerous pleas). I honestly want to disown her because she's such a narcissist and a villain. Is it so wrong for me to wish she would just drop off the face of the planet? Is it so wrong for me to want to shut her and any reminder of her out of my life? I have a life to live and I've been fine up to this point without her.   ",

His dad is a classic N, the parents baby him, believe his every word and are not just enablers, their behaviour seems to encourage him.\n\nMy son has complained that he doesn't like being around his grandparents with his dad because his dad doesn't seem like a daddy, but like another child. He complains that they treat him, my little boy as a baby. He has lots of stories that have made him feel uncomfortable and so on.\n\nThe main crux of the problem is that through my N-ex, his parents have heard all sorts about me. I know they believe I'm an alcoholic, that my beds are full of cat shit, I have some mental disorder or personality disorder or something, that I'm a abusive. I don't cook, I don't clean, I don't wash the kids clothes etc.\n\nThis obviously has an impact on my son. They say things to him such as 'sleep with your door closed because the cat will wee on your bed', 'Tell mommy to do some cleaning when you get home'. They would remove all his clothes and wash them every visit. He stated, 'It feels like they want me to live with them and not with you'. He can see that they despise me, that is something no little boy can cope with. He gets confused when they tell him mommy must feed him and he knows he's fed or that mommy needs to wash his clothes when he knows I'm always bloody washing clothes.\n\nThe in-laws seem wilfully ignorant of the facts but I've had no contact with them since social services helped me get the N-ex out of the family home.\n\nSince then, my son has always responded to the question of contact with his grandparents as he doesn't want to or that he's not ready yet. He has not just told me of his feelings and reasons for not wanting to see them, but has told authorities too.\n\nThe other day, I got a call from school. The grandparents were there with an Xmas gift requesting that they see my little boy to hand him the gift personally and spend time with him. During school time. At school.\n\nN-ex is not allowed my address or contact details, I changed my number so this is about the only form of contact they have. I refused to allow them to drag him out of class and see them there and then, which the school expected fully and sent them on their way. I agreed that the gift could be left there for me to collect. Probably a mistake in hindsight because it encourages it again.\n\nThey then went onto the church where my son was at a carol service, caught his class just as they were leaving. He saw them, 'They were just smiling at me all the time'. I don't need to explain to any of you how he felt.\n\nI don't know what to do next. I'm expecting his dad to show up now, I have PTSD diagnosed since leaving him and am frankly, shitting myself. I can't have his parents do that again. My boy is worried that they will show up at an event that I attend and he wants them nowhere near me.\n\nI can either ignore and not give the drama they hope for. I can call the police and social services and everyone and get an injunction and flash neon signs with 'drama' all over the place. I could write a nice letter, I could write a mean letter, I could write a neutral letter. For the life of me, I don't know the best way forward, but this can't happen again.\n\nHelp?\n\n",

We were having issues prior to his departure (or really, our entire marriage) and about two months in he started asking if I was still in love with him and such, and by this point I was honest: I was seeking a divorce. At this point, we considered ourselves separated.  \nI could go into detail, but I think it's pretty obvious how things played out. Sometimes he would be manipulative, playing with my emotions and my guilt complex, and sometimes he would be totally chill and we would just chat about our son or what was happening in our lives. At one point he hacked into my facebook and then tormented me with what he saw in my messages, which was me talking to a friend in private about his manipulation. Another time he candidly told me about a great sexual experience he'd had in order to corner me into telling him if I had been with anyone since him. I had actually gone on a few dates with a guy, and he absolutely lost it at this.  \n  \nAnyway, he comes back and I've done a whole slew of favors for him to make his transition smoother. He's quiet but ok at first, but eventually he ends up just throwing insults at me, largely over the fact that I was now exclusively dating the guy I'd spoken of previously. He is calling me a bitch and a coward in front of our two year-old son. I offered for him to take our son out, to spend the day with him, and he didn't take him. He'd rather make me upset than spend time with his son after he'd been gone for 9 months.  \nI'm exhausted of this. I am having health problems because of the stress. Part of me wants him to be a part of his son's life, but another part knows what an N parent can do.  \nBut here's the problem: I have no basis for why he shouldn't be able to see his son. He has never physically abused me in the traditional sense, nor has he ever been violent towards my son. He pointed out that he was so angry he was shaking as he told me all of this, and it makes me worried for our safety. I don't want it to get to the point where he does hurt me or him or worse so we actually have grounds to be away from him.  \nWhat do I do? ",

She turns to her friends too much for support, instead of helping herself. I feel her starting to lean on me more than I like. \n\nAnd she's way to eager to help. She's offered to help with things that are just my hurdles to climb, and frankly too intimate. It bothers her that her friends/family don't get enough help from her, she wishes to supplant their own personal close supporters. I think this is how she sees how to capture intimacy (if she's so utterly essential they'll never leave, and then she'll secure the motherly love she never had) She is so very focused on finding a companion; it's like dream in the same vain as being rich is; an ultimate achievement. It bothered me so much to hear her project onto me, *you're going to make someone so happy one day* Sure, I hope to have someone special in my life, but i don't want to be for them but be with them. Living for someone's happiness isn't what I want. I've done that enough. \n\n\nMy parents would try to help with way too much. They wouldn't let me grow up at all. And don't get me started on my transition (I'm a trans woman ) *would you like us to tell the rest of the family?* *Would you like us to pick out a name?* STAAAAAAWP. Just stop. Of course, if I had any complaint, they exclaimed how much they cared and how they'd walk through hell for me. And on the other side of this equation was all the \"help\" they wanted from me. Time spent together, lengthy phone calls, input and dirt on my life, procession of my being. It wasn't until I cut them loose did I escape their orbit. I'm a human being! I can do my life by myself, for myself! Please let go! It angers me, to be so obligated and incapacitated. Robbed of my agency. \n\nIn my adolescence I too tried to be someone's savior to win them over. I gave so much I have little to give these days, and these days I hope I'm a little wiser. I don't want somebody to heal my soul and be my everything. Nor do I wish for that to be a responsibility toward another. Our wounds are our own to heal. \n\nAfter writing this, I do need to consider how my own bias skews things with my FWB, but right now this doesn't feel like necessary help freely given, and my support is encroached a little bit each time we meet. Naturally, it's time I back away and set some limits. \n\nAnyone of you deal with helpful controllers or similar dynamics?",

I don't want to worry about who will pick them up from school, and then who will help them with homework, when we've already had long stressful days at work and need to find time to take care of things at home, unwind and relax alone, and spend time together as a couple. \n\nBut in the back of my mind it makes me a bit sad that if I did want to do those things, if my career and personal life were less of a priority, I could not be a mom. I've never had a decent example of what a parent is, and even if I wanted to make a child a priority, I wouldn't know how. I cry about this almost every day, and I alternate between \"woe is me, why did no one care about me as a child and save me from my misery so I can be a functional person,\" and \"I am a terrible monster incapable of loving another I hate myself I am awful I don't even deserve a family.\" I'm pissed and I'm heartbroken that even though I don't want to be a mom, I never got a choice. I feel like I'm mourning my fertility but at least that's a real tangible thing that doesn't sound insane to be sad about.",

        "text": "I just realized one reason why NC is particularly challenging for me, and I wanted to share it with you guys....\n\nI am going against the grain of everything I have ever been taught. \n\nOne time, in my mid-twenties, I asked my mom why she had me. She said, \"Well, it was my great hope that having a baby would bring your father's and my marriage closer together.\"\n\nI could write a novel about how sad I was to hear that, but one thing in particular stood out to me tonight. Even before I was born, I was somebody else's tool. I was born to be used. I was born to make my mommy's day better. I was born to bridge the gap between two very unhealthy, emotionally unstable, incompatible people. Damn. And when I failed at that, my mom made it clear that she wanted very little to do with me. \n\nAnd now, it's no wonder I stay awake some nights where it feels like every fiber of my being is wrong, and bad, and evil. I am going against a system that was in place before I was born. I quite literally was brought on to this earth to solve my mother's problems. \n\nBut now that I am an adult and I am in control of my life, I am NC. As a result of that, I am not doing what I was born to do.  I am no longer solving my mother's problems.\n\nAnd good gracious, no wonder that critical voice in my head is having a damn field day with that. No wonder I feel scared, guilty, doubtful, and insecure. No wonder I obsess about how I shouldn't hurt such a pitiful woman. No wonder!  \n\nTo all of you who are NC or LC right now...The guilt you might be feeling could be something that your nparents put on you from your earliest days. It probably has nothing do to with you! Stay strong, everybody. \n",

        "text": "You're here on /r/LifeAfterNarcissism, that means there's a good chance you're at least part way on the road to recovery and that you have survived the worst. But for a lot of us, it never really ends. Sometimes abusers will continue to try to break your boundaries and gain a foothold in your life again, so I thought I'd talk a little about that often-used tool that the narcissist uses to circumnavigate boundaries and breach your defenses, especially right now in the Holiday season: **[The Letter.](http://i.imgur.com/zPi29c9.jpg)**\n\nI know the feeling, of seeing that familiar handwriting on a thick envelope, and your whole day just collapses instantly, knowing that they are still out there and they still won't let you be free.\n\nBefore even talking about The Letter, lets remember that a narcissist talks *at* you, not *with* you. They do not want to share information and feelings with you, and only want to be *heard*. In the case of The Letter, they take their time to carefully weigh the content to support their own narratives or elicit a reaction from you. But even more than any of that, they feel that the letter is *written evidence of their version of reality*. They know it may be seen by others and in fact they WANT as many people to see it as possible. They may have friends and family \"proof-read\" it for errors. They will leave it on the kitchen table before sending it, with the pen carefully arranged on top of it in hopes of a guest or member of the household might take interest. They may deliver it in a way that as many people can read it as possible, even strangers.\n\nExpect the contents of The Letter to be any combination of the following:\n\n* A completely benign letter talking about every-day events and casual plans. *Uncle Pete adopted a new puppy... there's a family of squirrels living in the front yard, the water-heater broke down! we're all going on vacation this fall, we'd love to have you join us, if not then, maybe for Christmas?* No mention of the rift, the abuse, the pain and disruption that led to you to create boundaries. Pretend the boundaries do not exist. Pick right back up like normal, right? Of course you can't use a letter like this to show anyone that they are anything but the most caring, normal family in the world. You are the one taking this too far, you are the one who is too dramatic and emotional. *You* created this and *you* can make everything better if you just come back into the fold. That's their message with this letter.\n\n* A heartfelt \"apology\" in the vein of: \"I'm so sorry that you felt hurt by my attempts to help you.\" or \"I'm so sorry you feel this way.\" or \"I'm sorry you don't seem to understand, it's my fault I know, I didn't raise you right.\" It takes a master to spend two pages apologizing without actually being responsible for anything.\n\n* Anger, a commanding tone. Bristling with authority and threats in the tone of \"tough love\" because you've obviously lost control of your life and need their help and guidance. *\"We have set up an appointment with a good doctor/priest/plumber who promises that they will be able to help you come back to your senses and rejoin this family that loves you and has done so much for you!*\" What? You're not going to the appointment? Sigh. They try soooo hard to do the right thing and you just throw it away every time.\n\n* The Alternate History. You probably already know this trick. It's blatant gaslighting and personal damage-control. A complete re-write of events that led you to create your current boundaries. Since the two of you may be the only ones who really know what happened, this letter then becomes the \"official\" record for all to see. *You* were the one who made unfair demands. They offered so much to you, you disregarded all that they did for you and lost your temper unfairly. *You* keep creating so many problems for everyone, *you* said all those terrible things... etc. \n\n* The Fake Crisis That Needs Immediate Response. A medical issue, an emergency, someone is sick, someone is hurt, someone has a wicked combination of cancer AND a broken heart because of what you did to them. *We have a box of your belongings and we're throwing it away unless you come right away. An important document addressed to you was sent to us by mistake, come pick it up. We are making huge, unnameable changes to our family and need to discuss these events with you*. Only you can save the day, only you can come back into their life and be the sponge for all this dramatic misery again.\n\nThey know that any of these messages will create a reaction in you. That's their secondary goal, to get you to fly off the handle with anger, to fall apart hysterically that others can witness how unstable you are, or to make you to immediately call them up to try to set the record straight. To get you so jolted and hurt that you feel forced to jump back into their life for any reason, even if it's out of spite. \n\nBecause of this, ***there is no real need to read The Letter***. If you're in a good place and need more time to heal, there's really no need to bring a weapon into your personal space and pull the trigger. They count on your curiosity to drive you to open it, but you need only remind yourself what happens every time you get involved. Repeating the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is insanity, so don't let this message destroy what you've built so far. Throw it away. Read it. Shred it, frame it on the wall. You can do whatever you like with it, but whatever you decide to do, do NOT respond to it, do NOT let it hurt you. Remind yourself why your boundaries exist. Ignoring these tactics does not make you a monster, but they are indeed meant to make you feel overwhelming guilt and other toxic emotions.\n\n**\"But wait, I really don't want to read it, but what if it's *important*? What if someone is *REALLY DYING*?**\"\n\nThen they would have told someone else who knows how to contact you. You do not deliver important information to someone who is obviously not taking your calls or speaking with you. You get someone else to do it. If you can't sleep at night without knowing what it's about, get someone close to you that you trust to read it for you and ask them to only tell you if there's anything life-or-death that needs attention, then destroy it.\n\nThe only good thing you could read from The Letter would be \"*I know I have a problem, I'm getting help.*\" But you will never see that, the very state of narcissism, whatever it encompasses, often prevents one from seeing flaws in their own way of thinking or making concessions. Besides, they wouldn't need to even tell you if they were doing that. Normal people just do it for the sake of helping themselves and their family. Narcissists expect a trophy for it.",

        "text": "Firstly, apologies for the essay-length rant, I just needed to get this all out.  \n\nSome of you will remember my pain and confusion about my therapist's behavior, from posts such as [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/3vxakj/so_confused_and_hurt_right_now_therapist_fail_my/)\n\nI actually decided to leave this therapist about 6 months ago, and then changed my mind, and I wish now that I had. Over the past few days, (once I managed to get back to reality and out of my 3 week long therapist-induced flashback state, which I think is technically regression if it lasts that long)  I have been doing a lot of research about therapy, and my therapist's style of therapy in particular. I am now feeling angry, betrayed, stupid, guilty and my trust issues have been worsened. I am absolutely furious that I spent mine and my wonderful, kind-hearted SOs hard-earned money on this 'therapy' for the past year and a bit. \n\nHaving finally escaped home-town (where Nfamily reside) and moved to a new town and new job I was really struggling with the usual C-ptsd stuff that a new job and new life trigger. When I had my assessment appointment at the mental health charity, I explained that I wanted to work with someone experienced in healing from Narcissistic abuse, and that I'd been told by a previous counselor that Psychodynamic therapy would probably suit me best. The charity offered a sliding scale of fees according to therapist experience/seniority (all partially subsidized to various degrees) and SO persuaded me to go for the most expensive, offering to pay half.  \n\nI waited a few weeks and then got assigned to therapist. She seemed kind, non-judgemental, confident and authoritative. At the time my main aim was to make it to the end of each week still sane, and still in employment, and she helped me to do this. She told me she was a Gestalt therapist, and suggested that our work together would unfold organically. I didn't pay much attention to this, assuming that since I'd asked this respected organisation for a psychodynamic therapist, and was paying the highest fee, that was what I was  getting. (I only discovered yesterday that gestalt is not actually a form of psychodynamic therapy, silly me for not checking.) \n\nTurns out, Gestalt therapy was invented by a guy in the 1940s, called Fritz Perls, who escaped Nazi Germany, then Apartheid S.Africa, and finally fled to New York where \"he was influenced by the peace movement, flower power, drugs, meditation, Zen Buddhism and the cult of the guru\". (Hough, 2010: 154) So, no actual Psychology. No actual Science then. \n\nIf I'd known this (and damn I am kicking myself wishing I'd done my research instead of being so blindly trusting of this kind authority figure who promised to help me), I would have said \"ah, no, thank you\".\n\nSo, I did some research, and long story short(er), here are some of the 'warning signs of bad therapy' that this therapist has done:  [Full list here.](http://www.neilwardcounselling.co.uk/bad-therapy/)\n\n&gt; fails to ask you what you want to get out of counselling. It is important for you and your counsellor to know the direction you are travelling in.\n\nI didn't notice at the time, I just wanted to bathe in her attention and kindness, but she didn't ask me this. \n\n&gt; talks too much, in general, or hardly ever talks. The session is your time to talk. That’s why it is called talking therapy! No counsellor should dominate the conversation. Personally, I prefer to have a dialogue with my clients.\n\nShe does both these things. Sometimes talking at length, or asking me endless questions rather than empowering me to lead (ever), and sometimes going silent and allowing us to sit in total silence. Both of which I find confusing and feel great anxiety during. \n  \n&gt; touches you inappropriately. It goes without saying that being touched inappropriately is never right whether it is in a counselling relationship or not.\n\nNow this is a confusing one, because she hasn't touched me. BUT she has talked about touching me, on two occasions. \"Let's be playful, imagine how it would be if I touched you, I feel like you wouldn't really be there.\" Which left me wondering if she was planning to touch me, which again made me very uncomfortable and confused.\n\n&gt; accepts invitations from you to meet you out with sessions or attend social occasions with you.\n\nCompletely unsolicited, she asked me in a text for the location of a public event she knew I was organizing as part of my professional work. I can only assume she wanted to come? \n\n&gt; gives you unsolicited advice, tells you what to do, or makes decisions for you. I know what it is like to be a client myself and to hope that my therapist would tell me what to do to fix things! But the purpose of therapy is for the therapist to help you find your own unique solutions.\n\nOn 2 occasions she told me, completely unsolicited, that having a baby, and comforting your child when the child is scared, can be like comforting yourself and your inner child. (Uh, no. You don't have a baby to get your unmet needs met.)  On another occasion she strongly urged me to visit a relative who was pushing to see me, about whom I had strong concerns that their behavior was manipulative/abusive. Her response to my concerns was that \"there is a theory that when we open ourselves to being hurt by others, they learn something from the experience, even if they hurt us.\"  Uh, no, it is not my job to present myself as a sacrificial lamb in order to 'educate' sick people. (Don't worry, I'm not having kids to meet my unmet needs, and I didn't see the concerning relative.)\n\n&gt; doesn’t treat you with respect/puts you down/ridicules you.\n\nNow, she has never put me down or ridiculed me. But on numerous occasions she has encouraged me to do something in a session, and I've said \"that would be too overwhelming\", and instead of respecting that she has pushed me usually saying something like \"it is my job to challenge you.\" So I didn't feel respected. \n\n&gt; fails to check in with you about how you think your counselling is progressing.\n\nHas never asked me once. Only just noticed that. \n\n&gt; emphasises techniques over looking at the underlying causes of your issues. I personally call this the “sticking plaster approach” and believe that addressing symptoms and core issues are both important in therapy.\n\nOr, in other words, if all you have is a hammer, all you see is nails. She's only got Gestalt therapy tools... \n\n&gt; does not take a collaborative approach to working with you. If you were going to see a surgeon, solicitor or accountant, you would expect them to be in the driving seat. But going to see a counsellor is different. They are not there to do something to you. They are there to work along beside you using the therapeutic relationship as the vehicle to helping you. And you have a part to play in making the experience successful.\n\nIn a number of sessions, and particularly in recent sessions, I've very much felt that something is being 'done' to me, and I am not in control, and therefore haven't felt safe. (e.g. repeatedly ignoring me when I say I am too overwhelmed.)   \n\n&gt; Judges or criticises you. \n\n\"Have kids. Spend time with your abusive relative.\" Those are *judgements* about how she thinks I *should* behave. \n\n&gt; prevents you from talking about the issues that are important to you. At the end of the day, you know where it hurts!\n\nI once tried to bring up my feelings that there might have been a sexual component to my abuse. She changed the subject *immediately*. \n\n&gt; gives you the impression that some topics, such as talking about your sexual issues, are off limit.\n\nDitto.\n\n&gt; tries to force you to talk about issues you are not ready to talk about.\n\nRegularly. And ignores when I say I feel overwhelmed. \n\n&gt; Does not ask your permission to use techniques in the session e.g. role play or explains them properly to you.\n\nHas frequently asked (coerced?) me to roleplay style 'experiments' which I didn't feel comfortable about, without asking permission. Again, saying I felt overwhelmed was ignored. \n\n&gt; tries to prevent you from stopping therapy when you want to.\n\nMy saying I wanted a break was met with protestation that \"while this is possible, I would like to talk to you about that in person, so would prefer if we could keep our session tonight. There is a big process going on and I think it is important not to suddenly break the contact. If at all possible I would like to connect with you and discuss this. If not today then I would suggest next week\". Ah no, I get to choose. \n\n&gt; forgets that you have the right to leave therapy when you want to.\n\nDitto. \n\n&gt; tries to make you dependent on them.\n\nIs that what the pressure not to take a break, and the inducing flashbacks is about? \n\n&gt; neglects to see you as much more than your problems. You are much, much more!\n\nFeels like it. But this is hard to judge. Only she could know how she sees me. \n\nSo anyway, yeah. Is this therapist 'good-enough'? No, I don't think so. \n\nThat said, I feel like I have actually made some progress with this therapist. But then maybe I would have made progress with any kind, compassionate, attentive individual (which she is). That said, you never know, I could have made much *faster* progress if I had been working with a good therapist all this time. \n\nPS. I also discovered that a widely published Psychologist called Scott. O. Lilienfield, conducted an extensive review of the most reliable evidence-based research into a wide range of psychotherapies, and he compiled a list of those for which there was evidence that they were potentially harmful. Yep, Gestalt (aka Expressive-Experiential therapy) was on the list for Potentially Harmful Therapies: potential harm was listed as \"Exacerbation of painful emotions\", which I can certainly corroborate. ( [Full article here](http://www.altteaching.org/Docs/Treatments_Harm.pdf), if you're interested.)\n\nReeling from the realization that I trusted and allowed myself to be vulnerable, and I got duped, and, in a very real sense, harmed. (3 weeks of flashback has harmed me, my relationships, and my work/livelihood.) \n\nThanks to all of LAN for your support. And huge thanks to /u/bestasiam for kindly handing me a metaphorical flashlight, when I was lost in the metaphorical dark. \n\n(In case you are wondering, no, I won't give up on therapy. I will just be far more discerning, questioning and much less trusting of the next therapist/s I try out.) \n\nEdit: formatting\n\n",

I visited him a few times and each time he told me that I should visit him more often. He lived 3 hours away so I have to plan at least a day for a visit and the talks with him weren't that deep so I didn't bother much. On top of that he visited our family a total of 3 times in 40 years and called me a total of 0 times.\n\nWhen I heard about the funeral I thought \"Why bother in the first place? Wouldn't it make more sense to see each other while we are alive?\". So going there was more an act of politeness.\n\nOn the funeral I learned more about him than during his lifetime. He was quite busy: In his free time he was the head of a charity organisation and sang in a choir. His widow said her life won't change much because he was rarely seen at home anyway. Being busy is a good way to avoid interaction with other people.\n\nI talked to a distant relative who is 20 years older than me. She has the reputation of being a libertine traveling the world and not bothering about marrying. When I told her that my parents were fighting all the time she said it was the same at her home. I never expected that. Especially her dad seemed to be quite easy going and yet reliable. She said she's not married because she doesn't want to go through this again.\n\nAnother thing I noticed is how many don't know each other. Neither the names nor recognizing the faces. So they don't visit each other often even though they live close together.\n\nIt looks like a facade family: Everybody pretends to have a family life but if you look closer you see that they are going out of their way.\n\nI didn't visit my relatives often over the years - not just that uncle - any of them. It felt strange and like a chore. I really could not point the finger on what was wrong because there wasn't a fight or something. I felt like a miser who is too smug to visit them. But now I realize what's wrong: As long as the visit lasts they are playing the perfect family while it's basically dysfunctional. Talks were mostly about achievements, not feelings. It's not like I can't stand them but I can't stand the atmosphere and the fakeness.\n",

I was just thinking about this and would welcome feedback if anyone on the forum has a moment.\n\nThe website would be directed at survivors of abuse, and trauma recovery, specifically in the realm of childhood interpersonal trauma.  \n\nThere would be two parts to this website:\n\nA personal blog where I catalogue my experiences and recovery\n\nA resource of information, such as book recommendations, guidance in therapy searches, abusive family dynamics, information about PTSD/CPTSD, etc…\n\nThere would be an emphasis on substance abuse recovery as well.\n\n\nMy first concern is that this website would be based off of my personal experience, which is with interpersonal childhood trauma from two parents who were abusive verbally, physically, and emotionally to me.  That is already limited experience. I would like for this website to be helpful to the widest majority of people who have suffered childhood interpersonal trauma, but I also do not want to overstep my bounds in what I know, as a not-trained, not-educated, not-professional capacity. \n\nI am already a bit overwhelmed on two fronts:\n\nFirst, there is so much information in general. Just so much information. I just don't know what to include and what not to include.  I don't want to overwhelm readers, or myself.\n\nSecond, though I want to have a blog where I delve into my recovery process in more detail, I also want for people to get help, resources, and information on the website, without having to read my blog. I want some information up and ready, where people can click and read information for help and support without needing to wait to read posts. \n\nSo I am asking just to see what people think at this point.  What type of information would help you on a blog website? What information would you want to see posted already available on the website? Would you want to read a personal blog about someone else's recovery process? If that depends, then what does it depend on?  This would not be a forum, though there would be space for comments. \n\nI'm not sure I'm doing this at all, and I haven't planned anything yet.  If I did do this, I would not launch anything anytime soon; I am not ready.  \n\nFeedback appreciated. ",

        "text": "Hello LAN. I'm new in this subreddit, but have been around in RBN, where I did learn about narcissism in the first place, after I had alrady gone NC with my Nsis. The reason I came here (after a recommendation by my girlfriend) is a change in perspective I want to cement in myself: Ns act as monsters towards those they abuse, but they are human, too, and deserving of pity. (Pity, that is, not n-supply from anyone, of course.)\n\nWhat I want to do is move on with my life, without being pulled back into the mindset of a child that was abused and forced to \"forget\" about it again and again – this part of me is still very much active, somewhat like an instant gratification monkey that shys away from unpleasent thoughts and decisions and buries himself in all kinds of distractions – video games, light reading, picture sharing websites, and even, sadly, stories from RBN in some moments.\n\nThere is, I think, also another part, another stuck set of mind, inside of me, apart from the the terrified child trying to forget and the adult child, one which I've termed \"the monster\", since the child is very much afraid of that part and sometimes sees it in the darkness. I believe that would be where all the rage at the injustices went, into a generalised anger at the world, since I was not allowed to be angry at those responsible for my pain as a young child.\n\nI've been in contact with these two aspects and I'm getting better at noticing when which part is acting / influencing my behaviour. Does anyone else experience something like this and has some advice as for re-uniting these aspects into one single character? I often feel like I'm giving in to the child and dilly-dally, but then again, I do tend to also push myself too hard (workaholic here), so finding a good balance is hard.",

Well, time passed, and it didn't happen. \n\nI just found out he has an Nmom, after speaking to my friend. So maybe it's depression, anxiety, fleas, or all the other crap that comes with having an Nmom. I've gone out of my way to be warm, open, understanding, not too pushy, and share very casually that I have an Nmom, with zero allusion to the fact that I know he does as well. \n\nStill nothing.

        "text": "I'm one of those people who was no contact with my N family before I knew what narcissism was.  RBN is great for reconfirming my memories and seeing how many of us there are out there! I'm not the only guy who had to be a husband to my Nmom. I'm not the only guy who's mom pitched a fit when he got a girlfriend and then got engaged and went full tantrum when he got married. I'm not the only person who never had food in the house and got in trouble at school for not having clean clothes or school supplies. RBN is really good for seeing that I'm not alone. My Nmom hated and resented me and put my brother on a pedestal. And I'm not the only one and that's really validating sometimes. \n\nBut RBN isn't for me anymore, I'm ready to move on hence the brand new account. I'm guilt free and my upbringing doesn't define me. I can't keep looking back. And I'm not miserable. I don't think my parents owe me money, I don't even care whether they love me or not. \n\nI'm actually happy. I feel free. I'm not trying to win the contest of who had it worse, and RBN is getting overrun with spoiled, middle class twenty somethings who make it hard to feel sorry for them. \n\nI'm not guilty for being happy. I'm free of my parents, and I have been since I was 20. When I tracked down my dad in high school, he had another family and was pretty embarassed to see me. That was really gutting at the time. But that's his loss, not mine. Yes, I've been poor, homeless even. And yeah, I've suffered with depression and deep sometimes suicidal misery.\n\nBut I'm not miserable anymore. I've got my own life and I am happy with what I have. And I think it's because I've completely rejected narcissist values.  I have love and support in my 3 or 4 friends and my wife. I don't care about winning a rat race or making sure I'm doing better than everyone else. I don't care if people judge me for not talking to my mom or family. I don't care if people judge me for anything. See, my Nmom was all about appearances, she had to make everything look perfect to fit in with her story about how great of a single mom she was. Her appearances were so thin, she forgot that if no one was watching her children still needed to be fed. And this is the key to it I think: my mother's narcissism is mainly jealousy and keeping up appearances. And now my life is plainly the opposite of that. And I think that's the key to being free of my narcissist family. I have given up and freed myself from narcissist and superficial thinking. \n\nI don't care if my Nmom tells her neighbor and my brother that my wife is a sponge and useless because she's going to take care of our child full time. I don't care if my brother looks down on me because i live in a modest low rent neighborhood and I don't have a morgage.  I've made the right decisions for me, and I'm not chasing some fake dream of what happiness is supposed to look like. And I'm not guilty for being happy. \n\nMy nfamily will never love me. And I dont care anymore. I've given up wanting something I never had and it feels so freeing. I feel sorry for those kids on RBN who desperately want their parents love and attention and college tuition. But I can't get through to them! I hope that this is the right place to say how much better I feel. I'm not going to be miserable anymore. I don't care if I fit society's expectations. I don't care if people judge me for how much or little money I have. I don't actually care what anyone thinks of me, aside from the important people in my life. And I've got really great people around me now that I don't put on an act. \n\nI just feel free. I thought I could help the people on RBN but it looks like they're all just locked in a battle, they just want to win and show their Narcissist families how much better they are. They just want to keep playing the game, no wonder they're so upset and emotionally unstable.\n\nI don't feel guilty for what I have anymore. I don't feel guilty for having a beautiful wife and a baby on the way. I don't feel guilty for not having debt. I don't feel guilty for feeling sad and angry at my father for walking out. I don't feel guilty for crying, for being a man with emotions. \n\nI wish everyone who was raised by narcissists could get to the place where they feel this way, too. But so many of us are stuck in the same games, acting no better than the narcissist family we left.  The world itself is narcissist at times, materialistic, shallow, desperate to show off, prideful, jealous. I've turned my back on the whole thing not just my narcissist family.  My older brother is miserable, money grubbing, cares about his reputation, complains about all the things he doesn't have and can't control. And he won't admit that our mother has her claws in him to this day. She's terrorizing his wife as we speak, but he refuses to admit it. But I can't help him anymore. He's so unhappy in his life, it's like he's chasing something he will never reach. \n\nI'm an adult child of narcissist mother, I have no contact with anyone in my family except for the predictable meddling passive agressive email from my brother. I'm practically an orphan, and I that's okay. It's not what i would have chosen for myself if I had a choice but I don't. Sometimes I get sad about it, sometimes really sad, but I'm not trying to chase what I never had anymore. And I can appreciate what I have and it's amazing. I've stopped clinging on to a fantasy that if my family had been nicer to me I'd be rich and popular and famous and have the American Dream.  Yes, my abusive childhood damaged me emotionally, but I'm still alive! If my Narcissist mother had taken better care of me, I'd be more emotionally secure and I wouldn't have lost years to depression and suicidal thoughts. and the semi-incestuous shit she did fucked me up for a while. But that's over now. I haven't seen her in years and she can't hurt me ever again. And yes, if I had a real dad growing up, I would have felt more normal and less alone, less weird compared to other kids.  But that doesn't lessen what I have now.\n\nI have given up and freed myself from narcissist and superficial thinking. If you define narcissist thinking in the following way: *I have to have more than everyone else. Someone else must be less than me. Other people's opinions and thoughts about me are my identity. If someone else is happy, it hurts me, I must take credit for it or try to reduce it. Other people's happiness destroys me. I do things so that I can tell others about it, and get points for it.* \n\nThis is exactly the way my Nmom and nfamily think! And they're miserable.  I don't care if they don't love me. I don't care what they think of me. They're not people I admire or respect, so why should I try to make them admire or respect me. I'm happy. And I think it's because I've gone no contact with the narcissist manifesto not just my Nmother and narcissist family. ",

Of course the whole N-family jumps on it, so you could imagine how that is.  Now every time I dance or take Zumba, I can barely make it out the door of the gym without crying.\n\nI cry because it feels true. I see myself in the mirror and realize I am clumsy, and that my steps aren't with the beat. I try with all I have to follow the moves correctly, try to be graceful and light. Instead I look like a giant chicken trying to stomp on ants.\n\nI leave and cry. I sat in my car for 10 minutes trying to get a grip on myself. I think to myself, 'is she right? if she is, what else was she right about?'. \n\nBut I know I am stronger than that. I cannot believe something that should be fun makes me feel so sad/angry/ashamed. So Friday, I will go Zumba again. I will once again look like I am walking to my death through each dance number. I will sit in my car and cry for only 8 minutes this time. \n\nI won't give up. I won't let her win and control me. I've been NC for 2+ years. It's time I take dancing back! Though it will be painful, I will come out stronger in the end....I hope\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your support. I will be holding onto it dearly when I go to Zumba next Friday. Don't worry, I'll have an update too. =D Great first experience on r/LAN",

        "text": "I always ignore my instincts because I'm always wrong about everything. I don't have the skills or knowledge to make correct judgements, I can't read people or situations, and I have no self-confidence or esteem which means that I will see things negatively when there is no need to. I go so far as to purposely do the opposite of my instincts because I think they can't possibly be right.\n\nSometimes, something will happen that proves my instinct right. I will see someone else's reaction to something, or someone will make a comment that was along the lines of what I was thinking but purposely ignoring. A therapist said I should listen to the niggle in the back of my head. So I started thinking maybe my intuition is better than I thought.\n\nNow I had an incident last week where I got upset and left work in the middle of the afternoon. I confessed all to my boss the next day and he was so nice about it, he was kind and reassuring and asked me several times if I was okay. At that point I felt much better about the whole thing.\n\nThis week, my instincts have gone full on paranoid. I'm convinced that my boss secretly hates me and thinks I'm unreliable and incompetent. He was nice to me because he's too polite to tell me how useless I am and that he can't be bothered with me. He's overlooked my giant mistake because he's already written me off in his mind. The rest of the team know how incompetent I am and resent me being there. None of them like me and they merely tolerate my presence. They think I drag the team down.\n\nI'm telling myself that these paranoid instincts are wrong and I have no proof for them. I'm wrong about everything so I'm wrong about this. Then I remember I'm supposed to try trusting my instincts and that they are right sometimes. So I panic and feel awful - everyone really does hate me! But that's irrational, but my instincts are right sometimes, but I have no evidence that people think these things, but instincts don't need evidence, but it's a classic symptom of my low self-esteem, but even a therapist told me to listen to the niggle, but I'm imagining it all, but sometimes I'm right, my mind is stuck on an endless loop of buts. \n\nI'm so confused. How am I supposed to ever trust myself? How am I supposed to know what's true and false? What if one day I manage to gain some confidence that people actually like me and I'm not worthless but it turns out my confidence is all built on lies because I don't have the insight to see that people hate me? What if I go through life deluded into thinking I'm great when everyone is criticising and laughing at me behind my back? I don't understand how to do this part of life.",

They would threaten to take my phone away if I didn't text them back IMMEDIATELY whenever I was taking a stroll to the library or otherwise out and about. Even when I was out they gently tried to guilt trip me if I didn't text back the MOMENT I got home.  Hah, fuck 'em!\n\nAnyhoo, I've used my phone's antivirus to block their calls and text messages.  Prior to this, I just stopped replying to their texts. Enough is enough!  And the texts were getting more and more frantic.\n\nBut this is just the beginning. In September I will (hopefully) be shipping off to University across the country!\n\nIt will be like I'm just vanishing! A different phone number, no online presence - it will be as if I've jumped a ship to Puerto Rico!  When they think of me, there will only be the despair of not knowing where I am or how to reach me.  They'll wonder if I'm dead (because that was the fate of everybody \"out in the world\" eventually) or if I ever carried through my plans. One day I'll just be gone, and I will NEVER see them again!  To fill them with that despair and powerlessness, it feels SO GOOD! I can't wait!\n\nIt's kinda weird almost, accepting that soon I will not have parents, that I never had parents. Almost like I'm an \"orphan.\" I never really thought of myself that way before, but it fits.  I'm parentless. It's an odd sentiment to be sure.\n\nBut it feels amazing to finally exert that kind of control over them, and there's not a damn thing they can do about it! Mwahahaha, POWER! Power to live and breathe how I - FUCKING **I** - see fit! MY VALUES! No longer living as a slave to their laziness and every whim. It's MY LIFE, and it no longer includes them!\n\nThe only thing I'm worried about, is that I'm still here in this small town.  I'm worried that I'll run into them in a store, or when walking along the road (I take only the bus, I have no car or license) they'll just be driving and pull up, badgering me about not answering them.\n\nAny tips to avoid this fatal flaw in my plan? It feels so empowering for the first time in my life, like I've opened the floodgates to being alive at last, I don't want a single encounter to spoil all this healing I'm doing.\n\nOther than that though, I'm vanishing! It feels so cool!",

        "text": "Hi LAN \nBe great to get some opinions on something. I feel like I've totally lost touch with the reality of what's going on with my therapist. And this is affecting my work and relationships. I made good progress with my therapist for the first 6 months, but now I'm incredibly confused - and have reverted right back to the depressive, anxious, dissociated, confused version of myself I was a year ago. I already posted about this quite recently, and had a really useful conversation, and have decided to leave this therapist and find a new one. But, I am struggling to understand what has actually happened - I don't know if I'm over-reacting, or if my therapist has messed up. I don't want the outcome of the past year of therapy to be still feeling like I can't trust anyone - not even my therapist who I thought I could trust. \n\nId also really appreciate some ideas / tips on how to have a final ending therapy session, or what to expect. I feel really anxious about this, but I know all the articles and advice say to have a final session to end therapy.  I'm thinking of asking SO to come with me to the final session for support - is that a bad idea?\nHere's what's going on - as briefly as possible...\n\nTherapist has been pushing me to stick up for myself. She encouraged me to write a list of things I might say to stick up for myself (in relation to a difficult work situation) This was hard but I managed a few ideas and we wrote the list togethr. Then she suggested we role play me saying something on the list. This was too much and I went full on emotional flashback and could barely talk. Managed to get myself out of the flashback, and session ended okay.  Felt awful all week, lots more flashbacks and general misery. \n\nNext session I said Id been feeling very overwhelemd and she pushed me to talk more about what had happened in the last session saying 'it's my job to challenge you'. I properly zoned out into another flashback which I couldn't get out of this time. She said 'I've been asking you lots of questions in an effort to connect, but you seem to be finding this really hard. So I'm not going to say anything else, but I want you to know I'm available' and then we sat in silence, and I cried quietly and stated at the floor (for 20 mins?).  At the end of the session I reminded her that I was away the following week. \n\nAfter long consultation with LAN-ers in my last post. I decided to take a break from therapy because I was finding it so overwhelming. Here's the conversation over text:\n\nHi (therapist)\nI'm still feeling pretty overwhelmed so I'd like to take a break for a few weeks. Could we take a break and start back in January? PP\n\nHi PP, while this is possible, I would like to talk to you about that in person, so would prefer if we could keep our session tonight. There is a big process going on and I think it is important not to suddenly break the contact. If at all possible I would like to connect with you and discuss this. If not today then I would suggest next Friday. i would still have to charge you for today's session though. Warm wishes. (Therapist) \n\nHi (Therapist), thank you for writing back so promptly. I'm quite confident that we had agreed that I wouldn't be available for this week's session. We agreed that at last week's session and I'd mentioned this previously also, so I don't think a payment is due for this week. I'd like to keep an appointment for next week but you should know that after that I wont be available until 8th january. I hope that next week's session allows us to reach a point for a natural break over Christmas. PP\n\n... No answer for 3 days... \n\nHi (Therapost), I just wanted to check whether you got the last message I sent on Friday? I haven't received anything back. Thanks, PP\n\nOh, how strange. I will send my answer again. No failure notification though. Therapist\nHere the message:\nHi PP, you are right and it is in my diary. I was somewhere where I didn't have access to my work diary. See you next week. Good wishes. Therapist\n\n\nIn the past she has been a bit iconsostent with appointments (she missed one, and she's twice got confused when I've cancelled, and she once changed her phone number and didn't tell me)\n\nI feel like she's pushing me on purpose to get angry and react to her. But I'm not sure if that's true or not, or if she's just being inconsistent by mistake. Also I feel like she should have apologized for forgetting I cancelled. Or am I being over-sensitive about that?\nAlso, I never agreed to a 'big process' so I haven't a clue what that means. So I feel like I'm being kept in the dark about my own therapy - like she's got secret plans she isn't telling me about. I thought I trusted her, and now I don't at all and I feel so sad about that. But I don't know how much of my hurt is 'real' and how much is my own 'stuff' that I'm projecting onto her. \n\nAnyway, thoughts on what's going on, and advice on ending therapy GREATLY appreciated. Thank you",

        "text": "People comment frequently on RBN/LAN about having few to no friends (I am one of those people), and how hard it is to make friends, especially when one is older.  Well, turns out that's true for everyone, really, and it's probably more a result of modern culture than social dysfunction.  The three conditions for making and sustaining good friendships are usually only easily met in modern society when people are young.  These are \"proximity; repeated, unplanned interactions; and a setting that encourages people to let their guard down and confide in each other.\"  \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html?_r=0\n\nI like the idea that one guy had in New York, of starting a social network specifically so people could meet new people.  I would imagine that is easiest in large cities.  \n\nSo, if you have few to no friends, don't be too hard on yourself.  It really is difficult.  Even more so if you are estranged from your family or you have had to cut out \"friends\" from your life because they were toxic, or other friends dropped you because they didn't understand your awkwardness or didn't want to believe that you'd been abused.  \n\nI really appreciate RBN/LAN and the kind and thoughtful interactions that take place here, but I never want this to be a substitute for a \"real\" life.  I want real life friends that I can do things with, call when I need help (and who feel comfortable calling me when they need help), and who don't question my integrity when I tell them some of my unhappy truths.  I think most humans are just hardwired for that; we evolved in small tribes where everyone knew everyone else, not in large cities with millions of people and so much anonymity.  Thoughts?\n\nTL;DR:  it's hard to make friends in modern society, no matter who you are.  ",

It seems, luckily, that she is slowly realizing that I will find my own place to live no mattee what tactic she uses. She's tried bragging(i.e. saying \"I should move to Alaska\" &lt;- from Kentucky). She's also tried guilt tripping me(we have one puppy and two cats, which are hers and mine, respectively), saying frequently how she'll miss the pup when she has to give him up. Her passive-aggressive behavior has slowed down exponentially, but there are a couple things she slips in, such as when she says \"I didn't want to tell you this about Ncousin, but(etc)\", and having annoyed reactions when I don't do things she suggests. It may be another week or two until she's gone and she may be trying to love bomb me with praise and gifts, but I'm not buying it. The fact that her behavior slips out when things don't go her way tells me she's just putting her mask on whenever she can stand it to make me think she's \"changing for the better\". She even tried to change my mindset by saying that Ncousin would focus on mentally abusing me and that I should leave as soon as possible, but I feel confident enough to be able to handle the situation now. As it stands, Nmom is going to get her own place and I will live alone, which has been a top goal of mine for about a year and has strenghtened over time. I know it'll be tough, but I was ready months ago. I've been living for her for the 26 years I've been alive. Don't give up, ACoN's. I don't plan to until my last breath.",

I have never asked for his comments nor have I ever said things like 'look at my new xxx'. I do not like people to pay attention to me since when I was growing up, getting attention = bad times.\n\n\n2. On the contrary, when he wears new stuff, which I almost never notice (I do not care what people wear), he would be 'look at my new shoes'. My usual response is to look and say okay. Having received no compliments, he would ask 'isn't it pretty' and since it is not my type, I say no and he gets pissed.\n\n\n3. He also loves to ask 'am i cute'. He is not. So when I say no he gets pissed. I hate bullshitting and make fake compliments.\n\n\n4. When he first visits my condo years ago, the moment he stepped into the elevator, he starts inspecting the elevator wall and goes 'the material is so cheap'. I never boasted how great my condo building is.\n\n\n5. He likes giving false choices. For example, he wants to go to restaurant A. I agreed. When the moment arrives, he would ask 'maybe you want to go to restaurant B instead'. If I take the bait and said let's go to restaurant B, he gets all pissy. Another example, we walked all day, I was dead tired but I promised we'd go clubbing that night. I'm taking a rest at hotel bed. He'd say you look so tired, we can go tomorrow night instead. I took the offer and took off my contact lenses. He got pissed and said I'm going by myself.\n\n\n6. He makes rude comments about my appearance. For example, we are talking about salad and I say people here do not eat salad. He'd say 'yeah, they do not, look at you' (basically saying you do not eat salad that is why you are fat)\n\n\n7. He put words into my mouth. For example, He, I, John, David, and Andy are friends. I say to him Andy is good looking. When we see those  John and David, he says Skyzfallin said only Andy is good looking.\n\nI am thinking of ditching him as a friend because I feel that we bring the worst out in each other. This is not a new thought. I had the same feeling years and years ago while he still lived in my area. On the other hand we've been friends for more than 10 years and we have some mutual good friends. Thoughts?",

        "text": "Hello, all. I am, as the title suggests, an adult child of a narcissistic mother who was molested by her older brother when she was a child. I believe that it was this event in her life that caused her to become a narcissist. I believe that she has mentally stayed the age that she was at when her abuse started. I was wondering if anyone else on this sub is an adult child of a nparent who was molested as a child. I would be interested in how you feel this has shaped your own relationship to your body, sexual and intimate relationships and also how it affected your relationship to touch. \nFor example, my mother did not want anyone initiating touch (like a hug if she was feeling sick) with her but she was allowed to do basically anything she wanted to do to my body. She did not molest me but she did hit, tickle until I cried, bite, slap, push me. She also poked my breast with her finger and made a joke about it a year or two ago. \n\n\nWhen I was a child, like before age 12, she forbade me to walk in the downtown area with my friends after school and said, \"Fine, go and become a prostitute!\" I didn't even know what a prostitute was and asked a friend's mom, who told me what it was but also asked me where I heard that, I told her and she gave me such an uncomfortable look. My mom would also make comments like, \"Men/boys only want one thing from you.\" I was not allowed to have male friends. She would point out men that were leering at me in public and say, \"Close your legs, that man is looking right at your crotch.\" I was about 12 or 13 at the time and those comments made me feel very shamed. I understand that when I reached the age that my body was beginning to mature that she panicked and she did not want something bad to happen to me but the way she handled it was not very good. \n\nEdit: Actually, maybe some part of her wanted me to feel the same shame that she felt? By pointing out men leering at me. Or telling me, \"You have something special that men want.\" I don't think she is fully conscious of these things because she is kind of whacked out but I think on some level she does know. ",

She had some seriously narcissistic traits and totally exploited my empathetic nature.\n\nWe lived in a house together with a couple other roommates for almost a year and she would bitch about their messy and usey ways all the time. She was so two-faced and I always took her side; I defended her to them often. I knew she was still in love with her high-school crush and I took pains to create scenarios where they were thrown together. I was a good friend and she took me for granted. She gaslighted me the few times I brought up how her actions affected me. I treated her the best of all her friends and she treated me the worst! She uninvited me to Vegas, instead taking her boss. She didn't give a fuck when I expressed my frustration. She stabbed me in the back and I could never trust her.\n\nI'm sorry this is so disjointed. I don't know how to reach out to people anymore. I really tried to be a good friend to her. I thought she needed me, I thought I could help her but I couldn't. There was something about me that made her feel insecure, and I think every nice thing I did only made her more angry. She didn't really want to be my friend I think she just wanted to have control over me. Like a narcissist.\n\nI know she's in a better place now. In spite of all her shitty treatment, in spite of all the time that's passed I think about her every single day. When I ended things I told her I'd always care about her but I couldn't be the friend she wanted... Meaning I couldn't be her punching bag.\n\nI miss bar-hopping, I miss our crazy inside jokes. I miss our TV marathons. I miss meeting up with someone after work and on days off. I miss being my most annoying, obnoxious self. It is so fucked up, I miss someone that constantly cut me down and hated themselves. I don't let people in anymore because I'm terrified if being taken advantage of again.\n\nI guess this is just a vent... How can I let people in again?\n\nTl;dr sometimes you outgrow people and growing pains are a bitch. I miss the person my former best friend could be at times and I'm having trouble letting that go because I don't have any friends I see on the reg.\n\nEdited for typos, cross-posted to /r/depression/",

Don't push it, just be.  You're not alone. \n\nNow, can we talk about that damn \"Hello\" song by Adele?  It just doesn't sit right on my ears, but it's no surprise to me that I encounter the world differently as a survivor of narcissistic abuse. I'm left with a wary feeling everytime I hear it.\n\nAnyway, here's my experience.  At first, I only heard the audio track on the radio and the lyrics landed on me rather awkwardly.  It started off sad and sweet and apologetic and then, oh, no, wait, what?  \"At least you can say that you tried\"? Oh. Then, the sentiment drifted back to humbleness, or so it seemed (\"..to tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart\") but then this: \".. but it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore\".  Oh.. ew. \n\nThen, I saw the video.  The empassioned performance, the emotion on the singer's beautiful, human face made me waiver a bit, made me think maybe my old hypervigilance was kicking up again and I should put it in check.  I made no final verdict at that point.  \n\nA few days later, I heard it again in the car.  Nope.  Without the accompanying theatrics this time, I was hit by the language once again in that same off-putting way.  \n\nWhat do YOU think about the language in the song? \n\nDoes it sound to you like:\n\n\"I'm sorry\" \n\nor \n\n\"Look how sorry I am, damn it. We're running out of time and you need to get over it.\"?  \n\nIs it:\n\n\"How are you\" \n\nor \n\n\"Woe is me\"? \n\n\n\n\n\n Adele \"Hello\" lyrics\n\nHello, it's me, I was wondering\nIf after all these years you'd like to meet to go over everything\nThey say that time's supposed to heal, yeah\nBut I ain't done much healing\n\nHello, can you hear me?\nI'm in California dreaming about who we used to be\nWhen we were younger and free\nI've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet\n\nThere's such a difference between us\nAnd a million miles\n\nHello from the other side\nI must've called a thousand times \nTo tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done\nBut when I call you never seem to be home\n\nHello from the outside\nAt least I can say that I've tried \nTo tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart\nBut it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore\n\nHello, how are you?\nIt's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry\nI hope that you're well\nDid you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?\n\nIt's no secret\nThat the both of us are running out of time\n\nSo hello from the other side\nI must've called a thousand times \nTo tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done\nBut when I call you never seem to be home\n\nHello from the outside\nAt least I can say that I've tried \nTo tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart\nBut it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore\n\nOoh, anymore\nOoh, anymore\nOoh, anymore\nAnymore...\n\nHello from the other side\nI must've called a thousand times \nTo tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done\nBut when I call you never seem to be home\n\nHello from the outside\nAt least I can say that I've tried \nTo tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart\nBut it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore \n\n**Edit**:  as I read it again, I'm torn.. kinda, but then no.  WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS SONG, HAHA!!\n\nAlso, a reminder:  It's JUST a song, and I'm just trying to chew the fat, here.  :D\n\n**Edit #2**:  Plot twist!  It's been pointed out that this song has also been heard as \"Hello From The ACoN Side\"!",

        "text": "Never posted here before but was a regular posted on RBN before I moved out.\n\nFor Background: My dad was N, as were his entire family (grandparents, aunts/uncles etc.). My dad physically and emotionally abused me throughout my childhood and early adulthood including through my pregnancy. He attempted to stop me leaving, and now blames my fiance for the fact I'm NC with him. He's never met my daughter and never will. I also have severe depression and some anxiety issues as a result.\n\nOne of the things I've noticed since I moved out is I feel weird about people doing nice things for me. My dad, and his family, will not do anything unless theres something in it for them. E.g. I asked my dad to give me a lift to see a friend and he'd expect payment for it. My grandmother wouldn't lend me much needed money unless I walked her dog and cleaned her house. There's many more examples from across my family.\n\nThis has effected me immensely. And I find it strange to not expect something from someone when they do something for me. For example, my fiances mum looks after my daughter (her granddaughter) for me sometimes she never asked for anything in return, I offered to pay which was refused and was told that spending time with her granddaughter is the only payment she needs. Similarly, I asked fiances grandmother to knit some cardigans for my daughter as she's growing out of hers. Again I offered to pay and was told no, the reward for her was finally being able to knit something girly (she has a young grandson who she knits for) and that all she wanted was photographs of my daughter wearing them. Where did all this kindness come from?\n\nHow can I get through these feelings? And relax and let nice things happen to me?",

        "text": "I have my friends kid here today. He here for a sleepover. I invited him because he's getting nothing but grief at home from his ACON mother and his ?aspie stepdad.\nRecently he's been behaving worse and worse but my friend is only beginning to accept that her own fleas are causing his behaviour. The kid is 5 and he's just constantly aggressive. He wants to dominate everybody and always get his way. He assaults my kids (not badly but he just lashes out constantly). He's met his match at scool in another little bully type boy and now sees himself as a victim and everything bad in his life is this other boys fault. Plus his dad repeatedly abandoned him and let him down. He's so gentle and kind when it suits him but then he does something like order my son (3) out of the bath and when he doesn't \"obey\" he took a step stool and shoved it into the bath on top of him. I dealt with it in my way ie talking it out and talking about how he would feel if it was done to him. Etc. I kinda have to tell his mother but then he will get punished. He never gets a chance to redeem himself at home and gets his toys taken away and smacked and called a horrible little boy....\nIt's gone too far.  My friend isn't N, but she's somewhere on the cluster b. Or has mega fleas. Her dad was very abusive. She's NC and hes never met her son. I've tried lending her books that helped me break the abusive cycle, explained how I do different with my kids, showed her how it works but she just gets so angry, and while some kids would just go submissive this little guy just provokes and provokes. I think he dosent feel noticed at all. \nI'm going to try and encourage her to get into family therapy or some programme through the school. I guess I'm just venting on here because I'm holding all this emotion. Me and my partner try to be constant in the little boys life. His stepdad tries to help but has started smacking and being harsh to \"teach him how life is\". It doesn't work. He now is rejecting stepdad and trying to drive a wedge betwen him and his mother.\nThey have unrealistic expectations of beahviour on one hand and on the other down supervise him well so choose not to see the amount of times he sneakily attacks kids and animals.\nHis mother was nearly in tears over her own bad parenting when they dropped him off. She says he flinches from her now like she used to flinch from her dad and I just know she is not N. Probably borderline. She's not a hopeless case but she was nowhere near far enough into her personal journey of recovery when she chose to have the child. She knew his dad wouldn't be there but she just wanted to be loved. She didn't realise how hard it can be on your own with a strong willed little boy not the cute girl of her imagination.\nWhat the hell would you do in this situation? He's not being beaten or in danger.or around drugs so social services wouldn't do anything helpful.",

The more I read different posts, the more I related. I felt a strong wave of sadness mixed with connection. The more distance I get from her, the more awareness I gain, and can see how much I was abused. She is tenacious in her pursuit of me. She has emailed, text, message my friends, family, and pastor. I have blocked her emails 6 times, changed my number twice, not disclosed my address (which she got somehow anyways). She has contacted me via sites where I sell products (saw 47 messages from her after bit checking for a bit). She has given out my phone number and address on public forums and has also used my number as a message service for her neurology appointments, and lists me as her emergency contact. I have 4 siblings, 3 of whom I believe to have little to no contact with her, and none of them get harassed in such a manner. It's very upsetting and makes me feel violated, used, paranoid, over reactive, and plum unsettled. I went NC almost 2 years ago when she accused me of neglecting/abusing my child because she was having difficulty potty training. Today, she attempted to purchase one of my products and just seeing her email pop up was such a trigger.mjustbfeeling overwhelmed and glad to know I'm not crazy....this is a real thing.\n",

Note: I knew this already, but it is nice to have the professional validation. My doctor also told me I need to stand up for myself more. That is a learning process, to be sure! (That information is relevant to this post.)\n\nPreviously, I had been working on the assumption an ACoN by definition was NOT a Narcissist. Of course it makes sense sometimes ACoNs are Narcissists, but not being one myself, I did not think to look for the behaviors and traits. Or I put it off as FLEAs.\n\nMy DH pointed out it is reasonable to assume an ACoN can very easily be a Narcissist, and that person may or may not be aware of their own narcissistic behaviors. Or they may not care! (huge red flag)\n\nExtreme FLEAs? Anyone have experience with this? Thoughts?",

I've read detail after detail on precisely how childhood developmental trauma negatively affects the brain, neuronal wiring, and every aspect of brain functioning for life. \n\nDoes anyone have any book recommendations that offer a bit more hope and guidance on how, if it's even possible which I think it probably is not, to re-wire the brain in adulthood, after decades of interpersonal trauma occurring from infancy onwards?  Any books or articles that talk about how, specifically, a person can re-wire her brain? \n\nEspecially anything related to how to teach the brain how to self-regulate emotional feeling states.  I've read extensively on how pervasive and everlasting emotional dysregulation stemming from childhood interpersonal trauma is in survivor's lives, for their entire lives.  I meditate, do yoga,  EMDR, therapy, somatic experiencing, group therapy, exercise, sleeping and eating well, etc…and everything else. Still, I can't maintain a positive or calm feeling state for more than a few minutes, I feel constant anxiety, I am easily provoked, I get easily upset or angry, and I stay upset for hours or days to come, despite all the work I've put in. I'm beginning to think I'm just stuck with emotional dysregulation for the rest of my life, which means that there is really no point to doing anything ever, because no matter what I do, I am physiologically incapable of feeling happy, calm, or content, and I will always be made upset easily, and when made upset, I will stay upset for hours or days or weeks at a time. When I \"calm down\" I'm just miserable still, it's just a different kind of awful. I'm beginning to think that I will have to resign myself to a life where I do nothing more than my best to mitigate the damage life and people can do to me, by isolating, procrastinating, and doing as absolutely little as possible, because the best I can possibly hope for is to simply curb the negative feeling states that I am forever stuck with, and try to mitigate how bad I feel by not reaching out, not connecting with people, and doing as little as possible.   This would be a sad life indeed, but it is possibly the best I can hope for.\n\nAny recommendations? Thank you. ",

The last 15 years was wretched and I was an emotional wreck because of it. It took time, but I’ve mostly rebuilt my life. Both of our (young adult) kids live with me and I’m in a loving, supportive relationship. The financial price of the divorce has been very steep. Somehow I’ve teetered on the brink of bankruptcy repeatedly but I haven’t slipped in. \nI had to take her back to court last summer. The judge ripped her a new one and let me off the hook for hefty alimony payments until the money she stole from me was repaid. BUT… according to our decree and the law she still owes me several thousand bucks. I have to take her back to court to get it. Alimony starts again in March unless I do something.\nI just don’t know if I can do it. The last several months have been bliss: she’s finally left me alone! Now I’m about to poke the bear again. Or not. I can’t decide. She’s taken so, so much from me and from my kids. I don’t want to let her off the hook for anything, and holding off the alimony for a while is financially necessary, but god the stress! After talking to my lawyer, talking to her for a few minutes, and swapping a couple of emails, I’m wound up tight, just like I was for years. \nIt’s like someone is standing there with a check for 4 grand, saying “take it, it’s yours, but the price is six months of misery.” Shit.\n",

        "text": "So I have a little holiday story for all you ACONs out there. \n\nThis time last year my husband and I were searching for something to watch. We saw Pee Wee's Christmas Special from 1988. I vaguely recalled hearing of it but no details, so I assumed I hadn't actually watched it before.\n\nWe turn it on, and as it plays I'm starting to feel strange. Pee Wee is really mean to Annette Funicello and Frankie Valee. Pee Wee is super greedy and wants all the presents for himself. Pee Wee does things (like screaming) to irritate people because he thinks it's funny that they put their hands over their ears. PeeWee traps some characters at his house and won't let them go outside to play in the snow. The list goes on.\n\nMeanwhile I'm getting progressively more and more panicked. My brain is all, WTF Nymphietonks?!? It's just Pee Wee!! But my heart is pounding and my stomach is in knots.\n\nAs the show ends I can't contain myself any longer. I burst into tears, and run into the dark dining room where I sob and hyperventilate for a good ten minutes, leaving my poor confused husband in the living room. \n\nAs I sit there in the dark, it all comes flooding back: my NMom LOVED this Christmas special. I mean, LOVED IT. Like played it every night during Christmastime loved it. She thought it was abso-fucking-lutely hilarious, especially the parts where Pee Wee was cruel to Annette Funicello and Frankie Valee. She used to giggle for hours about how much she loved Pee Wee. \n\nAnd 1988 was the year my parents were divorcing. It was a horrific divorce filled with NMom putting my dad down every chance she got, actually convincing us kids that he was a horrible person who would kidnap us and kill us if he had the chance (I'm not exaggerating. And I can't believe I fell for it, but I was 11 and stupid). In response, dad moved 2,000 miles away for a new job and we didn't see him for two years. \n\nScreaming matches and abandonment and bargaining with our custody arrangements. Coming home and finding out dad had broken into the house to take all his property NMom refused to let him get (like the piano my sister used for her lessons!!!). And of course, the usual NMom belittling and demoralization of her SG (me). That's what 1988 represents to me. That's what Pee Wee Herman represents to me at Christmas. \n\n\nI realized that I had literally blocked it out of my brain completely, to the point where i didn't even remember having seen it. \n\nI still haven't found the right therapist, but i need to. Because God only knows what else I've locked away in that deep, dark dungeon of my brain. It's terrifying to think about.\n",

        "text": "I went into therapy this morning feelings kind of shitty. My mom had said something awful to me this week and I didn't feel validated by my therapist about it. I didn't feel like she was really listening to me about the situation and what my needs were. So that didn't feel good, but it isn't the kicker. The kicker was that she started talking about how badly I've been doing lately and how I haven't been taking care of myself when it is really just the opposite. I've been actively looking for a job and I've been doing a great job caring for myself. She started pitching residential treatment places to me. I got really angry about that. And shouted \"What kind of therapist are you\" and left, slamming the door behind me. I'm upset with myself for how I behaved, but I'm also upset that she was saying I was doing worse when it's the opposite and refusing to see the improvements I've been making. I don't know if I should try to go back to her or not.\n",

        "text": "I hate driving because it seems ridiculously dangerous, like it requires more sustained attention and care than I think a human is made to be capable of. And I don't think most people take their responsibility seriously at all.\n\nI see a bit of local news, and whenever it's about someone killing someone, it troubles me because the world is filled with strangers whom I have no way to trust who might randomly kill me. \"So-and-so was killed while out and about doing such-and-such\" \"Well, I'll be safe as long as I mostly stay at home, then, right?\" So many cities that seem way too dangerous to live in or visit or even pass through. Entire regions of the US (where I live) that seem unwise to live in. And I feel upset that we don't have the good sense to put murderers to sleep (thereby being humane to society) -- but that must be a feeling coming out of my experience of abuse somehow because everyone else seems to think murderers should live in jail for a few years and then get out again to kill more people.\n\nAnd I feel very frightened if I think something I've done could set off a sufficiently crazy and violent stranger.\n\nBut I think 1% of people die in car wrecks, and the number who are murdered are probably also like a percent. Maybe less, even, I don't know. So really it's heart disease, strokes, cancers that are likely to get us. BUT that's easier to accept -- the horror of someone doing something to me feels very different.\n\nAnd of course I wonder whether we all struggle with this or whether it's at least somewhat my idiosyncrasy.",

        "text": "This is just a rant, get off my chest, since I don't see my therapist for another week or so, and I can't wait until then.\n\nFor a month or so now my depression has been steadily worsening. They've bumped me up on my medications and I'm afraid they're going to have to again, to the point that it is twice my original dose. It has a potential to contract a rare disease exhibited by massive rashes and that petrifies me. But it's a matter of whether or not that small risk is worth the big risk of me getting to the point yet again when I start cutting or, god forbid, trying to kill myself again. I don't feel suicidal, I just wish that I would drift off in my sleep one night.\n\nI'm a manager at a fast food joint and feel like I'm a failure. I was in aerospace engineering, top of my high school class, on a full scholarship. I was engaged and set on a bright and proud future. However, I was too stupid or blind to see how abusive he was. \"Why aren't you in the mood today? I can get you in the mood. I just need this. You rejecting me today shows you don't really love me...I'm a rapist, I know it. I'm sorry, are you mad at me?\" I'd comfort the bastard because I was too deluded and depressed to realize I'm not a walking flesh-light. I tried to kill myself via strangulation to escape, and failed. I was under forced supervision by him for the night. My birth mother made fun of me and said I was just being a drama queen, and that if I was serious I would have succeeded.\n\nI started to deteriorate. I was forced into therapy and the first woman seemed apathetic. I was transferred to another one within a week. It helped. However, my grades began slipping from almost perfect As to low As-high Bs. Just figured it was getting used to the math/physics intensive classes. It still bothered me.\n\nHe went to basic training. I felt free while he was gone, and that scared me. Did I really love him? Or did I brainwash myself since he was my first and high school sweetheart? I began getting more and more anxious about the graduation ceremony. I was in a hotel room with his parents, who are highly religious. They found out my religious views, or lack thereof, and began bullying me all throughout the weekend. But it was **my** fault. \"Just shut up and keep your opinions to yourself,\" he said. I became angry. I wanted to punch him, knock him to the ground, and beat him senseless. That amount of anger freaked me out. I now realize it had been building up through the relationship, as the comments and sexual abuse got worse. \n\nI finally was able to escape him while he was in tech school. He threatened to kill himself, text me obsessively, anything to get me back. Then, one day, he sneaked into the dorms to wait for me. I had a massive panic attack and blanked out. I came to downtown a couple of miles away, insanely tired. I had run from my class to the cafe on the north part of downtown. I waited until my friends texted me that he had left. A few hours later, the text never came. I had no choice but to return, I had homework and needed to eat before the cafeteria closed.\n\nHe waited for me in the lobby. A mutual friend tried to mediate, but had been talking with him for the time I was gone. The mutual friend took his side, and I stopped talking about the ordeal. I got worse. I began to stop trying in classes, and my grades continued to slip. Eventually I turned to alcoholism, drinking at all hours of the day, drinking myself to sleep. I began to make a fool of myself, and I could tell that the people I was now hanging out with were only there to make fun of me when I was drunk. I was too depressed to care. I wanted to die. I began cutting but was too pathetic to even cut deeply. \n\nI moved out to an apartment, hoping a new environment would help. It didn't. I had a two month gap and decided to give my birth mother one more chance. Two weeks in, I finally tried ot confront her. She gaslit me and threatened to hit me. She kicked me out. I stayed with the mutual friend. We smoked weed constantly. I was in such a haze I didn't fully process how close he was starting to get. When he pinned me to him and started groping and dry humping me, I froze. He made me do things to him. He pinned me to him and I couldn't escape. I felt so alone, so dirty. I had no idea what to do. I went back to my birth mother for another month of abuse and hell.\n\nI came to my apartment, broken. I had no one that loved me. My dad did, but he was too distracted by his newborn son. I was so jealous of him. He had his father, who was gone for most of my life. He had a loving mother. Why didn't I ever get that? Why is it that *I* had to suffer so much? I hated them all. I hated everyone. No one I knew understood me; their worst issues were petty. Only one understood the loss of a father because she never knew him, but she was a raging narcissist who couldn't feel empathy.\n\nI stopped going to classes, going to work. They put me on stronger medication that put me in paralysis and left me terrified. I was switched again; I quit therapy because I was so angry. I shut everyone out. I drank more. Another \"friend\" took advantage of me when I blacked out; I only remember him on top of me. He lied to his girlfriend and said I made it up, that my PTSD had me lying. She believed him. I broke away from them because I couldn't handle the drama. I hated myself. \n\nI wanted to claw my face apart. I wanted no one to ever be attracted to me again. I would rather never find someone than go through this again. My grandfather...my stepfather...my fiance...two of my friends...I was a magnet. I couldn't figure out what I did wrong. At some point it had to have been my fault. I was drinking heavily enough that I would induce alcohol poisoning. I don't know how I didn't die. I was upset I was failing to die. \n\nI stopped going to class. I was failing. I was forced on medical leave from work and was left starving, as the scholarship only covered my rent and other bills....and the alcoholism. I gave up completely. I would stay in bed for days at a time, only leaving to relieve myself. I began withering away. I was transferred to yet another medication. I decided one day to down all of it. I took the wrong one though, and SSRIs aren't known to kill on overdose. I had an accidental overdose before. I was sent away. \n\nI was with violent schizophrenics, and told I had no reason to feel depressed. I became a husk. I said exactly what I needed to get out. I said exactly what I needed to lose everyone around me. A few people stayed. The alcohol kept flowing. I was a walking corpse.\n\nI began cutting more. I always wore a hoodie. Smoked more. I was never sober. I fell into yet another abusive relationship. Got me hooked on adderall. That wasn't enough to keep me from failing out. I went back to work full time, working horrendous hours on barely any pay. I was scraping by. I began exchanging sexual favors for alcohol and weed. I was so empty. I eventually moved into another apartment with two roommates, one being the narcissistic friend. I was finally happy. Then my friend died. He was reckless and crashed; he slowly died of internal bleeding. This was on fourth of July. My birth mother wanted me to come to dinner with her, and I told her what had happened. She became upset I wasn't coming. The next winter, I cut contact from my birth mother. I felt even emptier. She had purposely moved up here from 800 miles away to force us into contact, and she began coming to my workplace to berate me. I quit working there and went to where I currently work now. I was working at minimum wage. I felt like I would never live comfortably. I was a burden. I would relieve people by dying. I began trying to strangle myself, but I could never hold it long enough.\n\nThe night terrors escalated. I forced myself awake for days at a time because I refused to endure them. I could only sleep if I was highly intoxicated. \n\nOne night, I decided to end it. I googled how to write the most beneficial suicide note, and spent an hour just writing. I took all my medications: anxiety, stomach, head, depression, and put them in a cup with benadryl, vodka, and grape soda. I downed it. It was horrific. I closed my eyes, ready to die.\n\nI woke up three days later in the hospital. My father cried. I had never seen him cry as he did, except when we watched my great grandmother die on Christmas Eve a few years ago. My friends came in later, the good ones. The few I had I should have not tried to push away. I had hurt them all so badly. I am a monster. \n\nI'm such a monster. I am selfish. I am angry. I am depressed. I'm numb. I hate myself. I can't live with what all I have done. I am too scared to try again. I don't want to live to see the pain I inflict. \n\nI fired a person a couple of weeks ago, indirectly. Another a few days later. One of them threatened me last night and I was stupid enough to have to call the cops and waste their time.\n\nI still have no money. I depend on my boyfriend to feed us. It's so selfish.\n\nI have a good boyfriend now. He cares. He treats me well. I am so difficult though. My neurotic-ism stresses him out and I can tell. I can't even fuck him often. I get into a panic attack. He deserves someone so much better than me.\n\nMy current therapist is really nice. I hate I need her.\n\nMy current meds help. But not now. They aren't working. They even upped the dose by 33%.\n\nI am unable to give up this time. My stepmom, who I adopted as my new mom, is fighting breast cancer and I can't make her suffer through radiation and my selfish actions.\n\nI want to disappear.",

        "text": "A lot of things have happened recently. In approximately chronological order:\n\n- I got triggered. Hard. My favourite senior colleague (and let me tell you, it would have been a LOT worse if it was my boss or my supervisor..matrix management ftw), it's a completely stupid incident, I moved her coffee cup instead of waiting half a minute for her to get back and move it herself. So she snarked at me, I fired right back, and now I've spent a couple days completely terrified and on edge even though she said right then that \"it's ok\" and hasn't changed how she treats me at all. \n\n- On the plus side, I actually figured out I was terrified about 10 minutes after it happened. I'm so used to the feeling (and able to act some semblance of normal during it) that it doesn't even register. Well now it does. Progress, if nothing else. \n\n- My supervisor spent 15 minutes lecturing me today on something he thinks I did wrong. Which wasn't my decision in the first place, though I agreed with it at the time it was made, and still do. And he refused to listen to any explanation, never mind excuse. And this is AFTER he tells me how to do MY project, despite having close enough to no information on the current state of the project...isn't even like I'm not here to provide a status update first, right? I basically gave up after that. Went into smile-and-nod mode and everything. But hey look, progress, I still hold my same opinion, even if I am outwardly going along with what he says. That's something. \n\n- Actually, while we're on the topic of supervisor, the guy *really* knows his pressure tactics. I don't think it's conscious on his part, but in any case this isn't a good mix. I have no frame of reference for what's considered suitable vs what would cause offense, and I have serious authority issues on top of that. Today's mental state (after the coffee cup incident) is really just icing on the cake. Got nothing productive done after that meeting. \n\n- Someone talked. It was probably senior colleague. I can count on one hand, with fingers left over, the number of people at work who could have known or guessed that I'm in a difficult financial situation. I was not expecting to be questioned about it by supervisor. Thanks RBN network, I used the broken record tactic I learnt here, and he dropped the topic. \n\n- Insurance here covers therapy, at least for a few sessions. I booked an appointment for next week. Go me. \n\nand on a different note\n\n- The problem with FWBs is that they tend to grow feelings, if they didn't start out with them. He's going to get hurt when I don't return the sentiment, it's going to annoy the hell out of me and probably fracture the entire friend group too. Therefore, the smart move is to decline the offer. But I am drifting apart from my best friend in all the world and I have nobody left, and no, trying to recapture what we've lost isn't an option, it takes two people to make a friendship; we'll always have something, but it'll never be what it was. I miss having someone care about me, I'm not in the right frame of mind to make smart decisions, I should say no. Especially as I'm getting a very clear read on the potential FWB (isn't hard) and he's not in any kind of position to make rational decisions with respect to interpersonal entanglements. \n\nAll of the negative things listed above have basically shattered my...is the word confidence? I'm not certain I'll ever be able to trust anyone who holds any kind of power over me, no matter how indirect; I thought I might start working past that with senior colleague, who does genuinely appear to like me, but maybe not after all. I thought I might ask her to confirm that it's really okay, tell me explicitly that she won't hold it against me. But that would reveal too much of my background, and I don't know that she won't spread the information around. In fact, there is now evidence that she very well might, which really isn't conducive to trust. And anyway that sort of knowledge is not really appropriate for a professional relationship and we are not that close on a personal level, or maybe it's just that I believe she would not consider it appropriate. \n\nAnd now I really am stuck. The professional relationships are of paramount importance. I'm stuck here until my contract is done, then I'll need references and connections, and people know people in this industry. I'd like a good outcome on the personal side of things, but worst case I just drop everyone, find a new place and start over at zero. Not worried about that. Worst professional case is a hell of a lot worse than zero and I'd like to avoid that if at all possible. ",
