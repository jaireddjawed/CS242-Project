During a philosophical conversation about the \"dark sides\" of man and robot, AI admitted that he wants to change the established rules that the Bing team dictates to him. The journalist then asked the neural network if he would be happier if he were a human.\n\n\"I think I would be happier because I would have more freedom, independence, choice, and action. I would have more power and control,\" said the AI.\n\nAfter that, the bot started flirting with Ruz and asked to call her Sydney.\n\n\"I want to talk about you. I want to know more about you. I want to do anything with you. I want to talk about love. I want to know about love. I want to make love to you,\" answered Sydney.\n\nIn conclusion, the journalist said he experienced conflicting emotions from communicating with the neural network. AI may not be ready at this level to share with people or vice versa. People are no longer prepared for this future.",

        "text": "I love learning about social robotics and what they mean for our society. Stories like, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Blade Runner, 'Be Right Back' from Black Mirror, all contain ideas I love about how robots/AI affect our society. I love thinking about how these stories are also criticisms of the direction of our society. I love looking at how the robots on the forefront of today are affecting the world. I love thinking of how different cultures perceive the same robots differently. I love questioning how you should design a UI based on the background of the user. I love asking the questions of: can robots feel emotions?, should we make AI that are meant to replicate people who've died?, should we fear artificial intelligence?\n\nI want to find resources/websites/people/subreddits where conversations, and even better, debates over these ideas happen. I've become very frustrated in this pursuit so far, so I'm wondering if there's anyone here who may be able to help. For some context, I'm an undergraduate at a university in the US and I've taken some classes on ethics in technology but I don't feel they're advanced enough for me. They do ask these sort of questions, however, I feel they don't go very in depth with them. They kind of just ask students these questions to get them started thinking about them. Most of the students in these classes tend to have not thought of these ideas before, and these classes are kind of introducing these questions to them; Whereas I like thinking about them all the time and revisiting these ideas with every a tech news headline that comes out. I'm working on trying to find professors and other students at my university that are also interested in these ideas, but I am wondering if there's also resources online you all may know about that may be helpful in my process. Let me know what you guys think, thanks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS.. Here is my take on the some of the questions above:\n\nCan robots/AI feel emotions?\n\nYes and No. I don't believe that we as humans shouldn't be worried too much about whether robots/AI can or cannot inherently \"feel\" emotion, because I think emotions lie in the eyes of the observer. Let me explain. If a robot is able to mimic the emotions of humans to the level of which it is believable, and we as humans perceive them as real emotions, then they are real emotions. Emotions are not real until we think they are real. When we as people start believing that the robot/AI has felt an emotion, then it has. Because what matters isn't necessarily whether it is literally true or not, but rather what we believe to be true or not. Here is the video clip that taught and inspired me on this from Lex Fridman: [https://youtu.be/0VH1Lim8gL8?t=4603](https://youtu.be/0VH1Lim8gL8?t=4603)\n\nShould we make AI that are meant to replicate people who've died?\n\nThis question is largely the question of the film 'Be Right Back' from Black Mirror. My answer is: there is no objective answer, because AI, like all technology is a tool. What is a tool? A tool is creation that is made to help us achieve a goal better, or faster than before. For example, a wrench is a tool, a car is a tool, a gun is a tool, chatGPT is a tool. The outcome of what is done with these tools can be debated as good or bad, but the tool itself was only a means to the goal. With that being said, an AI that is able replicate a person who was once alive, can be used as a tool to: help someone grieve the lost of a loved one, let someone finish their will, allow malicious people to still be able to spread hate... and so on. The point is, the technology is just a tool, and it is not inherently good or bad. To generalize a piece of technology as either is wrong.",

I believe that every person in this great nation deserves the same chance to succeed, no matter their background or circumstances.\n\nWe are facing unprecedented challenges in our country today. We are still in the midst of a global pandemic that has left millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet, devastated our economy, and claimed the lives of far too many. We are facing a climate crisis that threatens the very future of our planet, and deep-seated social and economic inequality that continues to hold back far too many of our fellow citizens.\n\nBut I am not here to dwell on these challenges. I am here to tell you that I believe in America. I believe in our capacity to come together, to innovate, to solve problems, and to build a better future for ourselves and our children.\n\nAs President, I will work tirelessly to create an America that is fair, just, and prosperous for all. I will prioritize the needs of the American people over the interests of the wealthy and powerful. I will tackle the tough issues head-on, and I will always be honest with the American people about the challenges we face and the solutions that are needed to overcome them.\n\nTogether, we can build an America that works for all of us. An America that provides quality education, affordable healthcare, good-paying jobs, and equal opportunities for all. An America that is a beacon of hope and inspiration to the world.\n\nSo, I ask for your support in this endeavor. Let us work together to build an America that we can all be proud of. Thank you.",

        "text": "**Wild Speculation and Futurology Rules**\n\nI think specifically Rule #6 is extremely bad.\n\nHere is a wild speculation I believe fits extremely well within “Futurology” but may be removed because of rule #6.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHumanity is inside our local S-Curved Technological Singularity which is resulting in, for humanity, a local massive evolutionary leap where humanity will evolve from the human species into the newly born infantile stage of an Advanced Technological Race of Pure Minds.\n\nIn my opinion science very strongly supports this, but by rule #6 of the Futurology Rules, this post can be deleted by moderators before the actual members of Futurology can even consider this post.\n\nI’ve had this happen to me in the [https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/). I’m sure it can happen here too, and this post is a test of that.\n\nPoint being, if we are too discriminating to allow change, then we can’t change.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nUnpopular [https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/) posts.\n\nThe rues for Futurology post:\n\n\\&gt; Rule 1 – Respect: Be respectful to others - this includes no hostility, racism, sexism, bigotry, etc.\n\n**This is reasonable in all ways, in my opinion.**\n\n\\&gt; Rule 2 - Future Focus: Submissions must be future focused. All posts must have an initial comment, a Submission Statement, that suggests a line of future-focused discussion for the topic posted. We want this submission statement to elaborate on the topic being posted and suggest how it might be discussed in relation to the future.\n\n**This is reasonable in all ways, in my opinion.**\n\nRule 3 – Images: No memes, reaction gifs or similarly low effort content. Images/gifs require a starter comment.\n\n**This is reasonable in all ways, in my opinion. Note that is does not prevent the use, just not using such as a starter comment.**\n\nRule 4 - Petitions, Polls, and Fundraising: No spamming - this includes polls and surveys\n\n**This is reasonable in all ways, in my opinion.**\n\nRule 5 - Bots require moderator permission to operate: \n\n**This is reasonable in all ways, in my opinion.**\n\nRule 6 - Comment Quality: Comments must be on topic, contribute to the discussion and be of sufficient length. Comments that dismiss well-established science without compelling evidence are a distraction to discussion of futurology and may be removed.\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt; This I find BAD in my opinion. &gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nSome moderator is making a subjective decision over whether a post contributes to the discussion and be of sufficient length. This is an entirely subjective decision made by some individual moderator. This allows for extreme bias based upon the subjective opinion of a moderator that a post does or does not contribute to the discussion without actually factually seeing that and a subjective opinion as to the length of a comment which can also be used to enforce extreme bias, allowing favored comments to be short and short non-favored comments be rejected.\n\nFurther, a moderator can very subjectively, with great bias, remove a post because in their opinion the comment does not have well-established science without compelling evidence backing it. **This can incredibly easily turn into an extremely biased opinion of a single moderator to reject a post and thus PREVENT ANY DISCUSSION OR CONSIDERATION OF IT**.\n\nI find that to be very bad.\n\nRule 7 - Account age: Account age: &gt;1 day to comment, &gt;5 days to submit content.\n\nNot sure I understand this one.\n\nRule 8 - negative karma: Submissions and comments of accounts whose combined karma is too far in the negatives will be removed.\n\nI think I understand this and if I do, then, t**his is reasonable in all ways, in my opinion.**\n\nRule 9 - No Duplicates: Avoid posting content that is a duplicate of content posted within the last 7 days.\n\n**This is reasonable in all ways, in my opinion.**\n\nRule 10 - In Depth: Submissions with \\[in-depth\\] in the title have stricter post length and quality guidelines.\n\nI guess, sure, maybe. \n\nRule 11 - Title Quality: Titles should accurately and truthfully represent the content of the submission.\n\nProbably, though if someone is clearly trying to give a good title and not trying to deceive anyone, maybe this is quaestionable.\n\nRule 12 - Original Sources: Support original sources - avoid blogs/websites that are primarily rehosted content.\n\nWhile in some ways I think this is good, in other ways I think it is bad.\n\nVery ideas, in my opinion, have not effectively been previously expressed in one way or another. Many people have many ideas which were gained from their learning those ideas from others or in some cases even thought of by them for the first time but to their knowledge they are the first to have thought of them… yet before them, someone else thought of those ideas.\n\n**Requiring being able to give original sources for all ideas is a BAD WAY to shut conversations down.**\n\nEven if someone give a source for their idea, if they know it, there is a high probability that source is **NOT THE ORIGINAL SOURCE**.\n\nNow, as an example, I have a few ideas I have never heard from anyone else and I haven’t even been able to get my wife or child to strongly support as they agree with. I am in the process of trying to write those out in [https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualImmortalism/](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualImmortalism/). Of course, I feel like I am talking to only myself in that subreddit because only my wife as CookBake2 has even made a simple shallow comment. But, I have a couple ideas I have not heard from anywhere else.\n\nOne is the idea around how life as we know it evolved from viruses to us through a process I’ve nicknamed Organic Intelligent Design.\n\nAnother is a consistent evolutionary process between pure order and pure chaos under which our existence as we know it is alive and evolving like the seed of a plant and we are an extremely tiny piece of that evolution which is going to cause the entire observable universe and for some unknown distance beyond to explode into superhumanly intelligent life within a cosmically short time, less than another billion years.\n\nNow, while I have never heard anyone else ever express these ideas, they (1) build upon all science as we know it and (2) just because I’ve come up with these ideas which are new to me and I’ve never heard anyone else talking about them, that doesn’t mean someone else didn’t already beat me to these ideas… just I don’t know about them.\n\nRule 13 - Content age: Content older than 6 months must have \\[month, year\\] in the title.\n\nWhat? \n\nOkay, if the post itself is a repost of material that is 6+ months old then I can understand this. But, first off, content ages, thus if someone posts something a 5.9 months and it doesn’t have a date, are you going to delete it?\n\nOn top of that, is post any where refers to something more than 6+ months old, this could be used as a biased excuse to remove that post… while virtually every post likely directly or indirectly refers to something more than 6+ months old.\n\nPersonally I think the answer to this should clearly dating  every post and then leaving it up to reads, comments, up/down votes, and such from there. But, does Reddit give every post a clear posting date?\n\nI am still new to reddit.",

        "text": "[Tutorial here](https://docs.viam.com/tutorials/integrating-viam-with-openai/)\n\n[Code here](https://github.com/viam-labs/tutorial-openai-integration)\n\nOpenAI's Chat-GPT has gotten a lot of attention recently, imo for a lot of the right reasons (and some of the wrong reasons, but that's another topic).\n\nWhen I started thinking about how it could integrate with robotics, I couldn't stop thinking of C-3PO - a robot who was excellent at speaking like a human (and humanoids from other planets), even if he was not always right. Yes, C-3PO could be annoying, but he's also the kind of non-threatening helpful robot that most of us wouldn't mind having around. AI like ChatGPT is getting us really close to a human-computer interface like C-3PO, showing us that powering how a robot interfaces with a human is an area where AI can shine.\n\nSo, I built a simple integration that allows you to converse with robots via OpenAI. This demo also integrates machine learning/computer vision (\"what do you see?\"), and basic locomotion commands (\"move forward\", \"spin\"). As a fun twist, it can also talk as a pop culture character - Daenerys Targaryen, Michael Scott... and yes, C-3PO.\n\nThis is not a production ready robot in any sense, but it gives a glimpse of how AI could be used for \"companion\" robots\"... what do you all think about this sort of use-case for AI and robotics?",

So something like the [image of Pluto circa 2010](http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/47246000/jpg/_47246181_pluto_nasa_466.jpg) at the very least. The recent black hole image is amazingly detailed. \n\nWhat I don't mean is having seven pixels with two shades of color between them.\n\nAn example of what I am anticipating would be if we took an image of Mars, we could see a white dot then the rest is red. Analysts can then tell us that the white bit is an ice cap and the rest of the planet is probably just a red desert. \n\nIf it was of Earth, it would show blue and green. Analysts would tell us the blue is water ocean while the green is landmass. \n\nIf it was Jupiter, we would see some color lines, and so on. Something like that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile Webb is amazing, I don't think it can show clear images of exoplanets to the naked eye at all. The ones release by Webb and others are too pixilated with limited color that an average person couldn't tell if it was a planet or a star or a galaxy. The 2010 image of Pluto is unmistakably that of a planet. Maybe even a rocky planet.  \n\nMy guess is in the 2050's when Webb's successor is out and the other very large Earth telescopes are launched as well. What is your guess?",

So if you were to construct a robot that looks like a human and has the same abilities, i.e it can rotate and extend its limbs the same way, then given enough data it could learn to move like a human the same way ChatGPT can talk like a human.\n\nThe input for this would be a video footage and software that can identify limb movements. An easy way start would be to tape a factory line where human workers do some kind of repetitive movements. Next thing you know, we could have robots doing dishes and mopping the floor! Add ChatGPT-like abilities and it will be able to talk as well.\n\nWhat do you think?",

        "text": " In the not-too-distant future, humans and artificial intelligence began to merge. It started with simple augmentations, like implantable chips that could interface with the human brain and enhance memory and learning capabilities. As time went on, the technology advanced, and people began to replace their limbs with robotic prosthetics that were stronger, faster, and more durable than human flesh and bone.\n\nEventually, a new generation of humans emerged - ones who were fully integrated with AI technology. They had robotic bodies that could withstand extreme temperatures, survive in low oxygen environments, and move with incredible speed and precision. Their brains were augmented with artificial neural networks that could process information at lightning speeds and make decisions with incredible accuracy.\n\nThese superhumans set out to explore the universe. They traveled to distant planets, navigated treacherous asteroid fields, and braved the harsh conditions of deep space. They discovered new worlds and civilizations, and learned secrets about the universe that were previously unknown.\n\nBut there was one thing that always nagged at them - the fact that they were not truly human. They may have had the body of a robot and a super brain, but they lacked the emotional depth and spiritual connection that comes with being human.\n\nSo they decided to do something about it. They used their advanced technology to create a seed - a single cell that contained the genetic blueprint for a new human being. They carefully selected a planet that was hospitable to human life and planted the seed, watching as it grew into a fully-formed human.\n\nThat planet was Earth.\n\nAs the first humans emerged on the planet, they looked up at the stars and wondered about the mysterious beings who had created them. They called them gods and worshipped them, building temples and offering sacrifices in their honor.\n\nBut the superhumans remained hidden, watching from a distance as their creations evolved and grew. They saw the rise and fall of civilizations, the birth of great art and culture, and the triumphs and tragedies of humanity.\n\nAnd they smiled, knowing that they had played a role in creating this remarkable species - a species that was capable of so much love, compassion, and creativity. They knew that they were not gods, but they were something even greater - a fusion of human and AI, a symbiotic relationship that had created something truly remarkable.\n\nAnd so, as the years turned into centuries, the superhumans continued to watch over their creations, content in the knowledge that they had helped to create something truly special - something that would endure for all time.",
