        "text": "Hello everyone.\nI need help (ideas) to react to a situation at university in which a professor is being unreasonable.\nIt's a mandatory class in which the professor is still very careful when it comes to Corona (nothing wrong with that in itself, but it's just not acceptable in this situation nor to that extent). So the professor insists on keepin ALL windows open during his 1½hr class. The entire time. It wasn't too bad until now, but when it reaches -10°C or below that idea is fucking nuts. Everyone will freeze in their seats.\nOf course this issue has been brought to him but he doesn't care. His reply was to \"bring blankets from home\" which is frankly a stupid idea. He wasn't open to alternatives either (like everyone wearing masks or opening the windows every half hour for 5 minutes which is recommended here and how it is done in schools eg) and he is all in all not someone you can complain to without him taking it personally.\nSo my instant thought was \"well, if he doesn't address a problem if it's asked of him nicely...make him regret his decision.\" Which lead me to malicious compliance. \nI had some ideas about getting a really loud heater and put it up next to the seat so that he'll have to talk really loud to make himself heard. Spend all class running around the room to keep warm and to annoy the hell out of him. Or leave the class after 5 minutes, return after half an hour, stay for 5 minutes, and so on (so only stay for the time he is supposed to have the windows open)\nJust little things I could come up with on the spot, but I need more ideas and couldn't think of someone better to turn to than the Reddit community for this ;)\n\nFyi:\nThis is a mandatory class, so dropping it is not an option.\nIt concerns classes of 5-10 people tops.\nHe is really high up in the department so it's complicated to complain about him and as I said he is a dick and not likely to change his behaviour because of anything, plus will take it personally and make your life difficult.\n \nSo, hopefully some of you have some useful ideas to help me out. It would be really appreciated! Thanks!\n\nTldr: need some malicious compliance ideas to make professor change his mind about keeping windows open all winter.",

        "text": "Inspired by the story of the 2 cent bill that couldn't be paid in cash, I'd like to relate the story of a repair business that only wanted cash.\n\nThe background is that I'm a musician and a speaker blew up like a month after the warranty expired. Figures. So even though I didn't have any warranty left, I still wanted the official repair guys to take a look at it. This is a business representing one of the world's largest brands that actually bought the original company that made my speakers. So I expected to be dealing with professionals. \n\nI brought the speaker to them, they said they'd take a look and quote me for the repairs. So far so good. The quote took weeks. Then it took them about 3 months to repair it, apparently having to wait (or have forgotten about) for the part that needed replacing.\n\nAt this point I was already mildly annoyed. I felt that months for a part replacement was pushing it, even with the supply chain issues. But eventually I got an e-mail with the notification that I could collect my speaker upon payment in cash. No way to wire transfer the money. And the bill was 330 euros and a bit. It was explicitly mentioned that they didn't accept cards.\n\nEnter the MC. Because I'm a musician and from time to time I go busking. I find the art of trying to entertain people who have no interest in being entertained challenging. Anyway, that means I collect a lot of coins in the process. They wanted cash? I will give them cash.\n\nI counted out the money in whatever coins I had in my moneybox. I put it in 2 heavy plastic containers and went to collect my speaker. So they got me my speaker, everything seemed fine and then the guy mentioned I still needed to pay. I produced my boxes. There was an audible swallow. The guy asked if I had larger money. I offered to pay by card. He said I couldn't. Well, then I don't have other ways of paying them.\n\nIt was amazing how quickly the three men working there passed this job to the only woman in the store. Because she got the honour of counting this money. I sat down and waited. It took well over half an hour and she claimed I was short. Now, I couldn't have been, so I went to try and check on her work but our systems of counting were nothing alike. Hers being the erroneous one. After several minutes of trying to work out what's wrong she spotted an error in her system that explained why she miscounted by almost 120 euros.\n\nI took my speaker to my car. I heard someone say that maybe they should invest in a counting machine. Yeah, that's the problem here, guys, the manual counting. Great deduction\n\nTL/DR: they demanded I paid in cash so I did. With hundreds of coins.",

        "text": "I work at a Cannabis Cultivation in the western US, totally legal. (I'm sure you can tell by my username) I started out in the actual grow as a general worker. For those of you who don't know what this entails. It's a lot of physical labor, taking clones, transplanting them into larger pots, then up-potting those plants into even larger pots. Moving them into the flower rooms once they were out of veg. Plus there is the ongoing deleafing/defoliation that has to occur for light penetration so marijuana flowers ie buds get bigger. Plus watering with nutrients.\n\nI started in this field almost 4 years ago. There's boss, and we've had a few different Head Growers(HG) since I started working there and staff turn over. My story begins...2 years ago\n\nWe got a new HG and he brought 2 workers in. The son came first, Sam, then his dad, Juan. Sam was placed in the veg and Juan was in the grow with me.\n\nI tried to tell him in the beginning how our boss liked things done and if he had any issues to go directly to the boss, Fred. Juan didn't want to listen to ANYTHING I tried to tell him. He point blank said 'I've done this (cultivation) for 5 years, don't tell me what to do.' \n\nI find out about a month later that Juan is making $2 more an hour then me! \n\nJuan was really handy when it came to maintenance items that would happen. But was super slow when it came to deleafing. I tried to tell him that he wasn't removing the leaves from the inside plants. He would respond, 'Don't tell me what to do!' I complained to the HG and apparently when HG said something Juan pouted... That afternoon Fred asking me how the deleafing was going?\n\nOP: 'It would be great. Except I have to go back over what Juan has done cuz he's not getting the plants in the center of the table.'\n\nFred: Have you tried to talk to him?\n\nOP: Yes. He tells me not to tell him what to do\n\nFast forward several months. I would have to spend an entire day on putting up the trellises. I even set up the brackets so they were color coded for each room with numbers/letters corresponding with what table and where it went on each table. I came in to find all of my brackets and disarray and rearranged. To the point where I could not take the brackets off.\n\nI asked one why he did what he did that I had it set up that it took me an entire day and his response was \" Don't tell me what to do.\" \n\nI marched right into Fred's office and slammed the ruined brackets onto his desk. I told him it took me an entire day to set up the brackets for each room.  Juan literally f'd them up I can't get these brackets apart. I'll need to go to the store and buy new ones. Fred asked me if I had tried to talk to Juan and I said yes his response was 'don't tell me what to do.'\n\nNeedless to say, Juan was let go because Fred couldn't afford pay him anymore... Which to me makes sense since he was costing the company money and wouldn't listen to anything The Woman who had been there for 2 years longer than he had had to say...",

        "text": "I recently moved and my new neighbours seem to have no concept of how much noise their making. Loud music until late at night, guests having loud conversations or screaming matches, you know the drill. It is important to note that there are so called \"Ruhezeiten\" (resting times) where I live, you are generally not allowed to make noise between 10pm and 6 am on weekdays. That includes loud music.\n\nA couple of days ago, at around 11pm during the week, I knocked on their door asking them to turn their music down as I had work in the morning. After being asked why that was their problem, I replied that not only for the sake of being neighbourly should they turn their music down (remember, down, not off, I'm no party pooper) but also because it's illegal to be this loud at this time of day. Their reply?\n\n\"What, you're gonna call the police because of some music? That would not be very neighbourly either.\n\n*So how about we all mind our business and just stick to our own appartment huh?*\n\nAight. bet.\n\nTheir party went on to about 2am, then they finally stopped. I meanwhile decided to take a homeoffice day to exact my revenge on their no doubt hungover asses. \nAt exactly 6am (knowing that my other neighbour had gone to work), I, for the first time ever, turned my 800W speaker system all the way up to 11. Volume, Bass boost, treble, everything. I also turned my subwoofer towards the wall that had their bedroom on the other side.\n\nI'm a big fan of electronic music, especially the hard stuff. Hardstyle, Tek, Psy, anything that is loud and has a lot of bass. So I let them share in my joy at full volume. Walls were vibrating, the ground was shaking, I decided to wear earplugs because it was just too much even for me. After about 15 minutes at full volume, I get a notification that someone is at my door. I open it, music still blaring at full power, to my pissed off looking neighbours in their pyjamas, reeking of alcohol. They of course asked my to stop, I replied:\n\n\"What, your gonna get angry over a little music? Well, that's not very neighbourly, how about you just stick to your appartment huh?\"\n\nI then slammed the door in their face and turned off my doorbell. After another hour of various dubstep, tek and death metal, I turned off my system, walked over to their door and rang up a storm. After opening the door all I said was: \"Peace? Ruhezeiten between 22 and 6 on the weekends? We cool?\"",

        "text": "Just read a story on MC that reminded me of some MC from the early 2010s. If Malice can be interpreted as getting one over on the system…this is malicious as fudge. I’m from Arizona. The wild Wild West. Home of the roads that are so wide that two of any compact size car could fit side by side in one lane. This works out because most people here can’t drive worth Shiite. \n\nSo here I am on the 202 minding my business, when I make an admittedly dumb maneuver of plugging my iPad into my car to charge on my 30 minute commute to work. I swerve a little in the process, but stay in my own lane. Good advice for all, actually. So at any rate, the reason I was struggling is because I had limited range of motion because I was buckled. This is important for the near future. \n\nNext thing I know I’m being tailed by a cherry red Dodge Charger with police lights flashing. Great, I’m being pulled over by a f#ckboy. \n\nHe pulls me over, I’m at a complete stop and in park, then unbuckle to reach for my license and registration. I roll down my window, police officer says I’m speeding, driving in an unsafe manner, and I don’t have a seatbelt on. I argue that I unbuckled to get my paperwork, he says he saw me unbuckled through my (heavily tinted) windows… You know, like a LIAR (love you John mulaney). \n\nI normally wouldn’t argue this point, but you see…this minor ticket would have major consequences for me, because Arizona runs on a points system, and I’m doing the math, and these three things he’s saying will most definitely put me in suspension-city. He says “well you can argue it in court …(and as he walked away he bitchily mumbled) or you could just shut up and pay the ticket”\n\nEnter MC\n\nYou see, my cousin works law enforcement, and though he never really liked discussing work, I remember one poker night he confirmed an urban legend that if you overpay on a ticket, they issue a refund check..and if you don’t cash it, your “claim” doesn’t get processed, meaning those points never show up on your license. \n\nI pay the ticket totaling $285.43 and write a check for $286.12. I remember the amounts to this day…\nI couldn’t wait to get that check for 69 cents … I almost wanted to call up and hound them, asking for my 69. I got the check, put it on my wall for years, never had those points show up on my license to this day.\n\n\n\n\n\nTLDRBHMOC - Too long; didn’t read, but here’s my original comment:\n\nThis reminds me so much of a loophole that seemed to work back in the early 2010s and anytime earlier than that in Arizona. Our drivers license penalties are on a points system. Wreckless driving is a certain number of points, speeding, unsafe lane change, etc. So any way I’m close to getting a suspended license based on points, something I can’t afford. I get a ticket from a lying cop who lied about seeing my seatbelt unbuckled, a minor ticket that has major consequences for me. He says u can show up in court or pay the ticket. I pay the ticket of 285.43, but write the check for 286.12. You know, for that pesky 69 cent “I hope it’s not late” fee. I then get a refund check for 69 cents from ADOT. Glorious. But the fun has only begun…I haven’t cashed that check in over a decade, and those points never showed up on my license. I had heard that if you overpaid by a little bit you’d get a refund check and your points wouldn’t be processed until that check was cashed to Finalize it. Totally worked.",

        "text": "Hi guys! I recently discovered MC and read like 10 hours non stop. I hope this fits well here! And sorry beforehand, English is not my first language.  \nThis happened around 5 years ago. I was working in an early stage start up as a software developer. The former developer quit before I entered and I was his replace. One part of the offer was becoming a partner with some shares of the company at one point.  \nI showed a lot of initiative, always giving new ideas and trying to improve things. One important detail is that my only boss at the time was the CEO.  \nAfter around 4 months they hired a guy who was friend of the Founder of the company and he had pretty good references since he worked before in one of the biggest companies of that country.  \nSo, this guy started being my boss now and his background is from another field, so he didn’t know anything about the technology, software, language we used, etc.  \nAnyways, I instantly notice his presence, since before him, the office was pretty quiet and after this guy came in, he started making calls all the time or talking with the CEO in front of everybody. Our office was only one room, so it was pretty hard to ignore it.\n\n  \nBefore this, I was always overworking arriving at the office around 9 and working until 20 or so, simply because I loved the project. But, after I noticed how loud the presence of Mr New Boss was, I started going pretty early in the morning, so I could work at least from 7:30am to 10am until Mr New boss comes in. The best about this, was when I was leaving at 17:00, he was always shocked because the first days he saw I had a different schedule.  \nSince he got in charge, EVERYTHING was TOP PRIORITY. We had a few meetings where I explained him my point of view about this, but it didn’t change much.  \nFor you to understand the kind of changes he was doing, here is an example. We had the typical TO DO list with 3 status, TO DO, DOING, DONE.  \nHe changed this to a TO DO and DONE only, because this would save time. So, I didn’t know on what the mobile developer was working on and if he needed something from my side right away looking at the To Do list. I had to manually ask him and also update him when I needed something from his side.  \nWell, after a few months with Mr New Boss onboard, I decided I needed to be a partner or leave the company. I explained this situation to the CEO and to Mr New Boss and basically said that I did a lot of things during this time, they loved my work, so I needed to be partner as the offer specified at the beginning of the contract. CEO told me: “we will get back to you with an offer”, Mr New Boss nods.  \nIn the meantime I was making some interviews with a company in another country and I received an offer it was 3 times my current salary.  \nCEO and Mr New Boss called me after a few days to have a chat. Mr New Boss showed some papers with some vague information and then started talking about how important is being a partner. It is not a 9 to 17 job, making reference at my schedule (that I changed since he entered). And then he said a lot of BS about compromise and no weekends, and non paid extra hours and so on. He finished his speech and the CEO didn’t say a single word. Mr New Boss asked me what do I think about that, so I answered: “Mm I think I was waiting for an offer with numbers and I don’t see any.”  \nMNB: “Well before that happening we need to see **you are actually willing** to work like I mentioned before. Staying later than 17 for example.”  \nME: “I am not. I am giving you my 2 week notice right now. I already have an offer waiting for me in another country.  \nMNB: “Yeah, sure. No worries, I understand”  \nThe CEO said nothing.  \nI came back to the office and tell the new company I take the job. And in 2 weeks I’ll be moving there.  \nThe next day, Mr New Boss asked to talk with me and he offered me a 10% raise. I told him, no thanks, I already took the other job.  \nTwo days after that, same story. He told me that he thinks he can get me  30% raise. I laughed unintentionally (because he was still trying to convince me) and said “no, thanks man! And don’t keep trying, because it is useless.”  \nMNB: “Okay, sure… So… Let me ask you something if you don’t mind”  \nME: “Sure, boss”  \nMNB: ”How much did they offer you?”  \nWithout him even finishing I answered “**300%**”  \nMNB: “ok, nice”  \nHe stopped trying to convince me after this talk. I still had  one more week at the company so the last day, the Founder appears (he was on top of CEO by the way). He called me for a chat, and went straight to the point.  \nF: “Can I offer you anything for you to stay?”  \nME: “Not now, I am actually traveling tomorrow”  \nF: “Okay, I am sad things went this way. If anytime you want to come back, talk to me directly. I can help you with relocation, flight tickets, whatever you need. Doors are open.”  \nME: “Thanks, I appreciate that”  \nSo, I start working in the new company and I still help the old one in the transition a few hours a week (paid, of course). They hired a new guy and he needed some help.  \nMNB: “New guy needs some help, installing LANGUAGE WE USE.”  \nME: “mm let me se if I understand. New guy is a LANGUAGE WE USE Developer and needs help installing LANGUAGE WE USE. Is that correct?”  \nMNB: “Yes”  \nME: “interesting… Sure boss”  \nSo I helped this guy with a few things and after a few days I completely finished my collaboration with them and focused 100% in the new company.  \nFew months later, Mr New Boss quits. Two more months, Mobile dev quits, New guy quits, CEO quits.",

During the semester I was offered a job out of state and therefore elected to drop the course.  After the paperwork was completed I received a bill for $0.24.  At the time the bull postage rate was $0.27 with the additional cost of paper, envelope, printing supplies, etc.  I thought that this was a little silly and I called the bursars office asked if I seriously needed to pay the bill and they said yes.  They said that there was absolutely no way to fix the billing system to account for billing that actually cost the university more than they would collect.\n\nCue malicious compliance:\n\nI then went ahead and write a check for $0.23 and sent it back.  The jokes was now back on my as I then received a bill back for $0.51 with the statement that the minimum finance charge for a balance was $0.50.  Now I am really dismayed, but another query to the bursars office results in another reply of we cannot do anything to the system and there is no way to clear the balance … blah, blah, blah.  As a note: it is not allowable to pay with change due to an incident of infidelity between a students husband and an employee at the bursars office that resulted in a tuition payment made with a shell barrel full of coins. \n\nSo I am now motivated to comply in a malicious manner just to get even.  I sit at my desk and proceed to write 51 checks for $0.01 and send them I. To clear my balance.  About 4 days later I receive a call from the bursars office regarding my payment.  They indicated that my submission was unacceptable as I was not allowed to pay with change.  I replied that I was not paying with change but checks which is in line with the policies set forth by their office.  I tell them that I will be happy to send them another check if they like and they agree.  I then go ahead and write a check out on the absolutely smallest scrap of paper I can manage it on and send it in.\n\nI figure this has to be the of the story but there is one more funny thing.  About three weeks later I received a check for $0.51 from the university to clear the positive balance on my account.  Ultimately it seems like someone could have written a trap in the accounting code to negate balances that provided less revenue than the collection cost but at least I had fun.",

        "text": "In 2019 I moved from an apartment complex in Celebration, Florida, to a condo.  As usual, when you move out of an apartment, you get a final bill, which includes your last month's pro-rated rent, deductions for damages, security deposit refunds, and the like.  We paid it.\n\nThe next month I get a call from my wife who says we've got a follow-up bill in the mail from the apartment management company, for $0.02.  We're both in the tech field, so we laughed that this company's IT deparment didn't catch the edge case of spending $0.50 in postage to collect $0.02 in revenue. But it happens.\n\nMy wife prints out a copy of the bill.  I grab two cents from the change jar.  The apartment complex is on my daily drive, so I swing by the office.  I walk in and tell the manager that I want to pay my last bill.  \n\nI say \"It's two cents. Here's the bill, and I have the two cents if you want it.\"\n\nThe manager says \"We don't take cash.\"  Nothing else.  There was an awkward pause.\n\nI say \"I don't expect you to take cash. I expect us both to have a laugh about how silly computer systems are, and for you to write off the two cents, because it'd cost you more to process the payment.\"\n\nShe says \"I'm not going to do that.\"  Again, awkward pause.  \n\nI say \"So you want me to write you a check ... for two cents.  And mail it?  And you're going to process that check?\"\n\nThe manager says \"Yes, send us a check and we'll process it.\" and then WALKS BACK INTO HER OFFICE to end the conversation.\n\nSo I go home and set up an automatic, monthly bank payment to my apartment complex.  For **three** cents.\n\nAnd then, because I'm a programmer, I write some code to send a letter once per month, saying \"I'm so sorry - I've overpaid my bill.  Please send me a check for the overpayment.\"  And I use an online service that sends post cards in ridiculous sizes - up to around 18\"x24\", figuring that'll be my escalation strategy.\n\nThe first of the next month, I get a call from the apartment company's regional manager.  After introducing himself, the next two minutes were the most sincere, \"Oh god, we made a mistake - please don't do this, we'll never contact you again\" apology anyone could've hoped for. \n\nI stopped the mail and never heard from them again.  Did I spend several hours on MC for two cents?  Yes.  Was it worth it? Absolutely.",

        "text": "I suffer with chronic pain, currently investigating the possibility of endometriosis. my employer had been very helpful and kind with reasonable adjustments up until recently. I had been working part time as walking is now so difficult that I use crutches and it's impossible for me to complete my full 9 hours without a flare up that will take me days to recover from.\n\nI returned to work after a surgery and they blindsided me and told me I MUST go back to full time as it's unfair on the rest of the workers, that they've bent over backwards for me (which they have to do by law, and I really did not ask for much) and my health should be totally fine now that I've had a surgery. so, I followed protocol and received a sick note from the Dr that suggested part time hours to prevent flare ups and time off. they refused. I did one full shift and then could not turn up to work.\n\non UK sick notes if the section \"may be fit for work\" is ticked and the employer cannot fulfill those suggestions of adjustments you are automatically considered unfit for work and the sick note remains valid. this is stated on the sick note itself and on the ACAS website (a site and helpline that discloses employee rights in the UK). I emailed about this and explained and asked if they would consider the sick note valid, they told me I would need a new sick note. they just wanted a sick note that said I was outright unfit for work to cover their asses as they knew there was absolutely no reason to refuse part time when I had already been doing it with no issues. I called in everyday as protocol required, but the voicemail system for calling in was disabled, so I was unable to. I sent them links and screenshots to the ACAS website, but the lady I was emailing refused to read them.\n\nI was told that the company MUST follow the attendance policy, I was asked rudely if I had read it. I explained that nowhere in the attendance policy does it mention this kind of situation, just that I would need the note, and I had already supplied the note. I also asked what their reasons were to refuse these adjustments under the equality act 2010 (this is similar to the US's ADA. under this I am considered disabled as I have had a condition that has impacted my daily life for over 12 months), and this email was completely ignored. \n\nI received a call from HR yesterday, and I was asked if I could definitely return to work under part time hours and if I would not have to go home due to flare ups. I told them yes and explained that without the crutches I struggled to complete the week at part time, but with them I can do this with no problem. full time even with the crutches flares me up to the point where I am still recovering from that full shift I did last Monday. she accepted this and told me I could resume work on Monday at part time hours and she would let the lady I was emailing know that this is the case now.\n\nthey wanted me to follow the attendance policy, so I did. it just didn't work out the way they wanted it to. I call that checkmate. I know full well they are trying to push me out, and I'm okay with that as this job is now a drain on my mental health with the way they have spoken to me and treated me. however, being the petty bitch I am I will be making it EXTREMELY difficult for them and causing as much strife for them as they have for me. all according to the law and their policies, of course.",

        "text": "My mom and dad own a franchise of a very well-known soft serve ice cream shop that sells \"blizzards.\" I started working there pretty young and have now been going on 7 years. I dislike my job and have actively been seeking a better one for a while, but circumstances out of my control have been keeping me there. ANYWAY.  \nI don't like my job, but I am pretty good at it and can't get fired because, obviously, nepotism. This has let me to some pretty petulant behaviors, especially back in my early days.  \nOne of my biggest pet peeves is when customers come in complaining about, \"Last time...\" i.e. someone I've never seen before could come in and say, \"Could I get an Oreo Blizzard with extra Oreo, please? LAST TIME I was here, they gave me barely any Oreo.\"  \nThis peeves me off to no end. More often than not, I have NEVER seen this customer before, I am definitely NOT the one who made their last ice cream treat for them (I have actually been told many times, by customers and even by other coworkers, that I make the best blizzards at our location), and I don't care about what happened to them \"last time.\" I have NO problem with people who order an X treat with extra X. I just hate it when they complain to me about \"LAST TIME.\"  \nSo, in my earlier days (I've calmed down a bit now), whenever someone would complain about \"last time,\" I would absolutely make sure to give them what they wanted THIS TIME.  \nExamples:  \n\"Can I get a Butterfinger blizzard not blended much please? LAST TIME I was here, they blended the blizzard WAY too much and the candy was ground down to a fine powder.\"\nI would politely say yes, and proceed to put the blizzard in the blizzard machine for one whole second. Now, the basic blizzard recipe goes like this: A base of vanilla soft serve, (or chocolate or twist, if requested) the candy/toppings, and then another layer of vanilla soft serve. So if you told me not to \"blend it much,\" I would literally barely blend the thing--the vanilla ice cream on top would be untouched, save for the hole the blender makes down the middle. I pulsed the machine maybe once or twice...not blended much at all. It's what they asked for, wasn't it?  \nAnother example:  \n\"Can I get a large peanut butter brownie blizzard with extra peanut butter? LAST TIME, they gave me extra BROWNIES instead of extra PEANUT BUTTER.\"  \nOh, you'll get your extra peanut butter, alright. I LOADED this guy's blizzard with peanut butter. It was literally runny from the amount of peanut butter blended into it. So what? It's what he asked for, isn't it?  \nFunny story #1: The \"peanut butter brownie\" person still comes in regularly and now specifically asks for, \"Not too much peanut butter, please.\" And, as far as I know, has never complained about what happened to him 'last time.'  \nFunny story #2: A very bitchy regular customer once told me to not blend her blizzard much because they blended it too much \"last time\" and I was so fed up with her bs I literally stuck the blizzard into the machine and pulsed it one whole time. She did give the blizzard a weird look when I handed it to her, but she didn't complain, and I never heard about her complaining (specifically about that). A couple years later, I started dating her grandson and we are going 4 years strong now LOL. I have told my boyfriend about how much I HATED serving his grandma/how I thought she was a total bitch/this specific instance in which I barely blended her blizzard, and we laugh about it!!!  \nYes, I am immature, bratty, and dumb for doing these things. But to be fair, I've never had a true \"complaint\" about giving people extra when they *ask* for extra and tell me about what happened \"LAST TIME...\" Moral of the story: If you don't like the way your food was made for you \"last time,\" DON'T complain to the tired teenager working at the register who didn't make it for you last time!",

        "text": "Tl;Dr team leader used an arsehole coworker's refusal to listen to women and his nicotine addiction to get him removed from a shift, and ultimately his job\n\nI'm a woman in retail merchandising, which skews male in terms of employment statistics. Most guys I work with are okay, but as the company I started with literally took anyone who was signing on the day the recruiter visited the job centre (that's how they got me), and the agencies we use to bulk numbers are even less picky, some of the guys are...not ideal coworkers. His story is about one of those.\n\nOn many of our jobs there's a \"no smoking in the delivery yard\" rule. Unless that's where the smoking shelter is, you don't smoke out there. One client does not allow smoke breaks between 11pm and 6am either, which irritates many of my coworkers due to the high level of nicotine addicts among them. If you get caught slipping into the yard for a crafty one, you're removed from the job, and possibly even the contract if you're a frequent offender.\n\nCue this guy, we'll call him Puff. He's a smoker, with an attitude towards health and safety that had already seen him kicked off multiple contracts, for things like climbing racking or throwing things that should not really be yeeted in the direction of other people.\n\nOn this occasion I was the only woman on the team, and the only non-smoker. As a non-smoker I had more freedom of movement than the guys: I was the only one allowed to take trolleys out of the front door (you don't realise how many shopping trolleys (carts) a store has until you've used almost all of them to empty three aisles of stock that are being moved around), and the only one allowed out unsupervised in the yard.\n\nNow, no one liked Puff. He was rude, and a nightmare to be around. And he was an arse towards women. \"I don't listen to women\" he had been heard to say. And the team leader knew it. But he had to be caught misbehaving by the store manager before he could be removed from site.\n\nOne of the things we needed to do, because the fitters couldn't be arsed, was throw the old shelves and brackets in the skip. This thing was an industrial one, nearly twice my height, and the end was closed. You _had_ to throw things into it.\n\nShelves are metal. And these ones were about 5ft wide and 25\" deep. I could lift them, and manoeuvre them into place, but throwing them that high solo? Not a chance! The guys could manage it though.\n\nI was always sent out with one of the guys, and told to make sure they didn't smoke winkwink. The team leader and most of the guys knew I'd turn a blind eye to a few quick drags in the shadow of the skip. But everyone was getting fed up of Puff and his attitude problem.\n\nSo the team leader sent me off with another pallet of mixed shelves and brackets (which were light enough for me to throw), and sent Puff trailing after me. Puff was happy to do so, realising it was an opportunity to suck down some nicotine. Only instead of ducking behind the skip, where he'd be out of sight of both the cameras and the warehouse door, he leant against it in full sight of both and sparked up.\n\n\"Y'know, you might want to go round the back so you're not spotted.\"\n\n\"I don't listen to women,\" was the predictable reply.\n\nAnd he leant there, slowly smoking, in plain sight. I saw movement in the warehouse, a silhouette by the rack of the store's hi vis yardwear. I said nothing.\n\n\"What do you think you're doing?! You're not allowed to smoke out here! Why are you letting him smoke?\"\n\n\"He doesn't listen to women.\"\n\nThe manager, needless to say, didn't want Puff to even finish the shift. And with most clients having red carded him for various reasons, he was asked to find alternative employment.",

So there’s one aisle that I need to work on consolidating to make room for another product that is coming in. I’ve been consolidating this particular aisle that was only 1 way traffic and I usually wait until no one is working in that area so I can drive back and forth if I find duplication products and combine it into 1 location. \n\nNow per safety rules, I can’t drive backwards into or inside an aisle, I have to go around and enter the aisle again. I got scolded about this because there’s a desk right next to this aisle to hand out orders to pick out all over the warehouse.\n\nSo now I have to drive around to the next aisle and then drive back in this aisle. Now onto my malicious compliance - I have to blast my horn at every intersection, every turn, every pass with someone, everytime I drop my machine. So before I would just go back and forth this aisle, blasting my horn was at minimum by 1 horn when going backwards, that’s it. Now I go in a loop, every turn I blast it twice. Now I go around and around blasting my horn 8-12 times per lap at minimum. Average lap times are 3 minutes.\n\nBright side about this, I’m deaf and I won’t get annoyed with the horn.",

        "text": "**Disclaimer:** I've been a long-time lurker. I think I actually created this account to lurk years ago for this sub. So, yeah, obligatory first-time poster, etc. Obviously, I'm switching names and locations to avoid getting sued.\n\nDecided to post because it just pissed me off.\n\nThe subject is a church, and since we live in a very litigious society, I'd rather avoid getting in trouble with a church.\n\n**Setting:** Ontario, Canada / Somewhere around early 2021.\n\nI'm a certified carpet cleaning technician. This means I'm a janitor who works for Malicious Compliance Cleaning Services (MCCS), a very good small-sized cleaning company of about 12 employees owned by James.\n\nJames has a custodian contract with Catholic Church (CC), which includes: mopping the bathroom and wherever there is a tile, mopping the gym (if the building has one) and mopping wooden floors, cleaning toilets and the urinal, collecting and taking out the trash, vacuuming, and minor stain removal.\n\nSo, what's under the contract are things that typically require chemicals or things that can take too much time and requires a custodian.\n\nObviously, there's also the carpet cleaning done bi-weekly but is done by a crew in our company, separate from the custodian. The crew tasked with carpet cleaning also mostly does the commercial side of the business.\n\nIf you've already noticed, yes, this church is not the Roman Catholic Church. They do a lot of activities in their buildings, thus the requirement for a custodian; people just don't go there every Sunday for a mass, but that's a part of it.\n\nIt's a great job, and I only get to spend a few hours daily working (usually in the evening when no one's in the building) while studying full-time. I also get paid around $1,200 bi-weekly, which is pretty good for a full-time student. James is also a great boss and also has a history of sponsoring immigrants.\n\nWithin a week, I clean eight churches and usually spend around 2-3 hours per building, depending on the building's condition and size.\n\nBut mind that I take my job seriously and sometimes do things outside the contract, which might not be the best idea in hindsight. I clean window sills, flush down the drain in bathrooms to remove the smell, wipe windows, wipe tables, etc. (small things)\n\nThese are not under the contract, but I did them anyway because they don't take too much time to do.\n\nSometimes, I also go and help out with commercial work.\n\nOne day, Joe, who is CC's cleaning inspector who inspects our job moved to another province.\n\n*(cleaning inspector is not an official title. I don't think they have one, but CC usually has a guy who inspects our job and reports to the higher-ups. We'll just call it a cleaning inspector. I don't know how CC's staff structure work, but we believe the cleaning inspector is voluntary.)*\n\n So, the cleaning inspector was changed, we'll call him Dickus. \n\nOne day, Dickus called James to accompany him during one of his daily inspections early morning because he said we were not doing our job well. Dickus said James needed to see it for himself.\n\nJames said Dickus was sliding his fingers on window sills, tables, and surfaces to check if there was dust. Dickus didn't say anything when there wasn't but looked at James for a few seconds without saying anything if there was a tiny bit of speck of dust.\n\n*(He was wearing black rubber gloves. So, if the glove shows a bit of grey, for Dickus it meant it wasn't dusted.)*\n\nHe also went to the bathroom to check the tiles to see if they'd been cleaned *(which is fair)* and make sure it doesn't smell. *(When not mopped, yes, sometimes tiles do smell, but it's mostly due to the drain on the tile floor, that's why I flush water down.)*\n\nIt smelled because I didn't flush it that night. I admit I just didn't bother, and it didn't smell. Then, they checked the gym and everything *(all was well).*\n\nDickus looked at James disapprovingly. According to James, it was the small things *(that wasn't included in the contract)* that Dickus didn't approve on, including tables not being wiped with some gunk on them.\n\nThere was a small gathering that night, and I didn't bother to do a lot of the things that I usually did. I don't know what I was thinking that time - I just didn't do it.\n\nThis inspection was close to the end of the year, and one day, Dickus said CC is not renewing the custodian contract with MCCS on three of their church buildings. I was assigned to two of them.\n\n\"We're thankful for the services you provided. Unfortunately, you failed to meet our cleaning standards,\" said Dickus.\n\nJames said he recalled being stupefied and said ALL the things Dickus mentioned were not under the contract, and during the inspection, what was stated in the contract was fulfilled.\n\nDickus responded, \"it doesn't matter,\" and they were just unsatisfied with how we cleaned and cut corners. *(Sometimes, yes, we do cut corners when cleaning is obviously unnecessary. Because sometimes the buildings are left in great condition, thanks to their volunteers, and I only have to do the long work like mopping and vacuuming - that's not even cutting corners now that I think about it.)*\n\n\"Okay,\" said James, unable to really do anything since the contract renewal is optional. But he was still troubled since, for a small business, losing three churches would impact the rotating fund.\n\nOur profit comes from our commercial front, mostly from cleaning houses. So, if our rotating fund gets a cut, that means our profits take a nosedive. Which means fewer hours for workers and no bonuses.\n\nJames also needs to feed his family, and basically, the money he pockets comes from the profits. Our wages are included in the rotating fund. So, if his profits are low, he doesn't earn anything.\n\nWe get more money from contracts, but included in the rotating fund are equipment and vehicle maintenance, which takes a LOT of money.\n\nAnyway, we struggled for a few months, but James figured it out and signed a cheaper short-term contract with a corporate business.\n\nThen, another cleaning company took the contract for the three buildings. James said the new cleaning company was also cheaper.\n\nAccording to James, one of his close friends at the church said Dickus complained that the new company didn't do what was in the contract.\n\nApparently, the rooms were messy, and dust built up. The restrooms smelled. I don't know what else since James described it as just \"apparently, it was really messy.\"\n\nBut knowing the contract wasn't broken, we're pretty sure the new company just did what was under the contract and nothing else.\n\nAnyway, within a year *(early 2022)*, before the end of the new company's contract, Dickus offered the contract with MCCS.\n\nJames said with the increasing insurance rates, inflation, and a bunch of things, that he's adjusting his price higher. The original contract was around $45,000 a year per building. James offered $55,000 per building.\n\nDickus apparently was aghast and said James was being unreasonable, and James said that indeed he was. He did not want the contract, and instead, renewed the short-term contract with the corporate company to a long-term contract; which I got assigned to.\n\nJames is also affiliated with the church and is close buddies with a higher-up who gave him the contract years ago, to help him get started with the business, but this buddy of James left the region years ago.\n\nOf course, James told his old buddy about what happened, and his old buddy wasn't happy. He told James not to renew the contract.\n\nDickus hired another, and James said, \"it's even worse.\"\n\nApparently, Dickus was removed as the cleaning inspector, and they have a new one. The church also made an announcement that every time people use the building, to clean up their mess.\n\nSo, unfortunately, there's no happy ending. Dickus still goes to the church and volunteers sometimes. He just doesn't have any more leading positions and is still pissed at James.",

When they introduced it, they did so under an assumption that using it would be completely optional. That pretty much backfired because almost nobody was using it, or they weren’t using it as it was intended. At this point, I had a really blowhard district manager who thought he should be idolized by the management and sales associates below him. When he noticed nobody was really using it, he decided to put pressure on all his store managers by saying if their employees didn’t use it, it showed “a lack of inspirational leadership” on the part of the store managers as a way of guilting us all into using it so he would become number 1 in usage.\nAt this point, my store manager just asked us to use it so he would be left alone. Fine.\nMalicious compliance number 1.\nI HATED (and still hate) the expectation that I should be required to shout out sales from my store. To me, it’s like we were all hired to do a job, management doesn’t think we can do said job we were interviewed and hired for, so they need constant visibility on sales. Fine. I created a generic shoutout.\n“[Employee] sold [item]” and then accompanied the message with the most condescending “good job” gif I could find.\nThat part worked and our district manager was mostly off our ass about that for the remainder of his tenure with us, which thankfully wasn’t much longer after this all started. From that point, we all thought we were in the clear from constantly needing to use the app. We were wrong. The interim district manager (a store manager who was trying to get the position so he was doing the work of a store manager for his store and the district manager for our district) was SO MUCH WORSE. He found a way to run a report that would break down each individuals app usage and the amount of messages they would put in the chat. He began putting that info out in district wide emails calling out the lower 25% as needing to do better with engagement. Of course I was almost always on the bottom because I only put my generic message and gif into the chat when sales happened, I was never engaged with other people in threads or direct chats, because I didn’t care.\nCue malicious compliance 2.\nSince now it became purely a numbers game to the interim DM, I played the numbers. After the first few weeks of those emails where I was at the bottom, I decided to try something. I found a chat message that nobody replied to from earlier in a week that the report wasn’t run for and then picked a lyrically heavy song (in my first attempt it was Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody) and proceeded to reply to that chat in an individual thread 1 word per message at a time until the entire song was put into the thread. Sure enough at the end of that week, I jumped from nearly dead last in usage to exponentially more than anyone else in usage. The interim DM never questioned it or checked why I jumped so high, so fast. Every week, I’d pick a new song and type it out word by word in a blank chat thread and every week I would be shouted out for my exemplary app usage and how more people should be engaged as much as I was.\nWe still use a chat app and we are still volentold that we have to be engaging in it, but I’m back to my generic message with the same gif over and over any time there’s a sale since that interim never became our DM and the new ones since don’t check the usage report anymore.\nSales are dumb. Metrics are dumber. When the metric becomes the goal over the actual sale, the metric is the problem.",

The building was under construction (finishing units and such) so there was quite a bit of dust but other than that it was fairly easy work and at the time I was getting above minimum wage.\n\nI was the only cleaner in the building but I was good friends with the security guards and would hang out with them on most of my breaks. They were all smokers and I noticed that they were taking small break so if I happen to be near them when they were taking a smoke break I would hang out with them.\n\nMy boss was a sweet guy, but he did casually mention that the smoke breaks for smokers only and I couldn't just hang out with them. Next break I had I sat down with the security guards and they joked that I should just have a cigarette in my hand but not actually smoke it. That's when I decided to be a little bit creative with my malicious compliance.\n\nThe next day I came into work with a small pack of sparklers. I kept them in my pocket and when I saw the security guards taking a smoke break I went out with them pulled out a sparkler lit it up and just kind of stood there with them as the sparkler went off. We all had a good chuckle about it. \n\nThe boss saw me and came outside probably to talk to me about not taking a smoke break if I wasn't a smoker, but he saw the sparkler in my hand. The security guards pointed out that technically I was 'smoking' as the sparkler was producing little bits of smoke. The boss laughed it off, apologized, and said that as long as I get my work done I can take smoke breaks with the others with or without the sparklers.",

You have to be present to collect or give a parcel. \n\nI logged the return on a Saturday and received a message they will collect it before 5pm on the Monday. I had a doctors appointment so I requested the driver to come later. He gave me such attitude and never pitched. I received the same message for Tuesday only no driver at all. I received a message that they tried to collect from me but it failed. Bull man. They did not even come. Now it’s a second day gone where I have had to wait around for a driver to not pitch. It’s now day 3 and I’m livid. The message about the fake attempt sent me over. I contacted the company and complained and the agent sent me the same damn message about it being collected before 5pm that I’ve already been sent. I felt like he didn’t take my complaint seriously or understood why I can’t wait around all day anymore, 3 days of not being able to run errands, worrying about meetings being interrupted. I offered to change the option to dropping it off but they refused. \n\nSo when the email to give feedback arrived I gave him a bad report. I felt he didn’t take the complaint seriously and that the least they could have done was ensured the driver arrived first thing to collect or give me an ETA. He then emailed me to tell me my feedback wasn’t fair and that I should give a more fair feedback as he feels he did my best to help me. His best? By just emailing me the same message I’d already received 3 times? \n\nSo I complied. I gave him the feedback he actually deserved. His best?? How is telling me the same thing I’ve been told for 3 days now the best? The best would be to get off his ass, pick up the phone and send the driver to my address first thing. He could have taken the attitude the driver gave me seriously and apologised for it and for the delay. He did not. He could have understood that I couldn’t put my life on pause for a third day to wait for a driver and at least gotten an ETA from the driver? Like yeah.\n\nI also changed the feedback heading from issue unresolved to agent has a bad attitude. The cheek to tell me to give him a more fair review when my initial one wasn’t even unfair was over the top. So he got an even more fair one. \n\nI just want my parcel collected, my refund processed so that I can buy another item to replace it. Why a driver had to cause so much drama only he will know. And now an agent made it worse. \n\nSaid agent has not emailed me since. However within an hour the driver pitched up. Outcome accomplished. \n\nWas I being a Karen? Yes! Do I care? No! I’m not unnecessary and will complain when it’s warranted. But today I got petty and yes his job is at risk but maybe now he will understand what actually doing his best really means.",

It was a 3 day round trip and they were paying for hotels, meals, etc. \n\nWell, day of at the last minute just as I am getting ready to load the store manager informed us that this woman who worked at the accounts department was making the trip, not me. He then tells me to load, which I start, but I go to take the spare tire out of the cargo area to return it to the rack under where it belongs. We’d just had it repaired. \n\nThe manager, who was standing around talking saw me and asked me what I was doing. I tried to explain that I was putting the spare where it belongs but he starts yelling at me and said that he’d never seen anyone who thought driving without a spare was smart.\n\nPer his supervision I loaded the truck. By myself. And per his supervision the spare tire was now behind several boxes of refrigerators and stoves.\n\nThe worst case scenario happened. The accounts woman got a flat on a stretch of 95 in Virginia and managed to exit but was stuck in the middle of nowhere. This was pre-cell phone days. A cop came along and they contacted the manager. \n\nWhen all was said and done the store was out a few hundred bucks for a new wheel and tire, which was easier than unloading the truck.\n\nThe manager made my days miserable for the last few weeks before I went back to school.

Both the landlord and the property were in the same city, so we would typically just mail the check the week before and that gave it plenty of time. So month 10 of our 12 month lease comes around, and after enjoying the festivities of the Fourth of July (which was a Monday this year), I get a text from the landlord at 11:20pm saying, \"Hey tenants, just wanted to let you know I haven't received your rent in the 4 day grace period that it is due, from the 1st of every month to 12am on the 4th. Please give me a call ASAP to arrange payment. Thank you.\" 12am on the 4th being almost 23 hours ago notwithstanding, I'm thinking, this is the most American thing to happen on Independence day. I see this text around 11:40pm, so I immediately call, offering my sincere apologies that we could not get mail delivered on a national holiday, and if he would kindly provide his bank routing number, I could wire him the rent money electronically. The landlord then made some excuse like \"I'll give you one extra grace period day just this once,\" but if he was going to interrupt my holiday than I was sure going to interrupt his. And guess what was sitting in his mailbox the morning of the 5th?",

        "text": "My work involves analysing all kinds of data.  This instance occurred around the time when our company was somewhat new (but still large enough to have 150 employees) and rapidly growing.\n\nSo far our data analysis had been retail companies, travel agencies, or even the housing market. For the first time we received a request to analyse health data from five hospitals in our area. The health data is very sensitive. So the raw data itself and the analytical result could not be shared via email or Dropbox. For the first time my team gets to see that sensitive companies go through channels that have a lot of security to share the data between us and the client. These channels cost money - but nothing too expensive which our organisation couldn't afford (something like $40 per month). Four out of the five hospitals have this data sharing channel which meant that my team was able to receive the raw data and also be able to provide the analysis via the same channel. The fifth hospital was new and they did not have this channel. Either our company or the fifth hospital needed to have this channel.\n\nSo I raise a request with the accounts team to purchase this channel and it is denied. Myself and my manager both raise it again and also discuss it with the accounts supervisor and it is approved verbally, but declined on the system once again after two weeks. We try again for the third time after discussing with the higher accounts manager and still no approval at the end to buy this channel. It is declined and we have been told it is the hospitals responsibility to share the data. And if we reach the hospital they ask us to reach the health ministry, which then asks us to get in touch with the local member of Parliament, etc. (so just a lot of bureaucracy that I shouldn't be managing).\n\nWhile this entire request of data sharing is being worked on, the time for us to receive and analyse this data is running out. We are waiting only on a single hospitals data which is ready to be sent to us (but only via an appropriate channel). So, I've had enough. I find out from the Health Ministry email response (while working on getting the hospital to buy the data sharing system) that the data can also be shared practically. Specifically, if I was to take a USB with me to get the data physically at the hospital and also return the output to the hospital the same way. This practical data sharing capability is deemed entirely safe. And that's what I started to do. \n\nEvery Monday I drive 30mins to the hospital at 11am, go to their admin team to retrieve the data in my USB, and then drive back to my work reaching at 1pm. Then I go have lunch at 1pm. I repeat this same task again with our analytical output on Thursday. Our contract is to analyse the health data for the whole year. After doing this for three weeks, one of the upper management person, whose office is opposite my desk, starts to think that I have been taking a very long time for lunch (from 10am to 2pm). He comes to my desk and asks if everything is okay and why I was away from my desk for 4hrs. I tell him the whole story. He is not happy at all. The cost of that data sharing system is nothing compared to the cost of paying my salary while I physically collect the data every single time. He puts the accounts team into their place by finding out that they approve of this system verbally each time and then deny it everytime after a few weeks. And literally that day we have this system all purchased, and then installed overnight. Although, I do miss the bi-weekly travel while listening to music to only do a copy-paste of files into and out of a USB drive.",

        "text": "Some context: My mom left my dad when I was 2 because he was an abusive alcoholic. A year later, she met a woman at work who was also a single mother, and they became involved in a romantic relationship. Soon, we all moved in together. Fast forward about 13 years. \n\nWhen I was about 16, I was going through the typical angsty teen phase. I was into bands like Marilyn Manson and NIN, wore all black, was fascinated with serial killers (which oddly enough has become mainstream these days), I’d spend a lot of time in my room, etc, but was generally a good kid. I never got in trouble at school save for the occasional letter home about me talking too much in class. I didn’t smoke, do drugs, wasn’t in a gang, all of which were common where I grew up. Around this time, my mother’s partner’s daughter was married with children, and we were all living in the same house. \n\nBefore I continue, I want to make clear that I have ZERO problem with my mom being in a relationship with a woman. I’m happy that she found someone that makes her happy. But at the time, I felt like it was “us” vs “them.” They liked to tease my mom a lot because she was really short and overweight, and I didn’t like that. I also felt a bit of coldness coming from them, like anything I asked of them was a huge inconvenience. Furthermore, they were very superstitious and took my interest in “dark material” pretty seriously, and sometimes I could overhear them talking about me. \n\nAs an only child, I tended to keep to myself and wrote a lot in my journal. In one of my entires, I just went off about how I felt about our living situation. It was pretty rough, but I would have never said any of it to them directly. Really, it was just me venting to myself. In retrospect, I think a lot of my feelings were just me trying to navigate not having a dad. One day when I came home from school my mom asked to talk to me in her room. She had my journal in her hand and opened it to the entry where i was talking shit about everyone. Apparently her partner had gone into my room, looked for my journal, and began to read it. Obviously they were pretty mad, but I explained that I was just venting, and why was she going through my things in the first place? Her response was, “well, you left it on your desk. Don’t leave it out if you don’t want anyone to read it.”\n\nAlright then. Maybe I WILL it out because I DO want you to read it. As I mentioned earlier, I was your typical 90s goth kid, the kind you look back on and cringe at. But they saw it as a sign of me being seriously into some legitimate occult, dark witchcraft shit. I thought this was hilarious and decided to play on that. I also wanted to find out if they were still reading my journal, so I decided to smoke them out. So I wrote an entry titled “ITEMS NEEDED FOR MY SATANIC RITUAL.” I made the list as ridiculous as possible so that it would be that much sweeter if they took it seriously. It had stuff like chickens feet, the fat f unbaptised babies, a black cloak, a sword…and finally…a lock of each of their hair. Then I left it open on my desk for someone to find. \n\nSure enough, a day later my mom calls me into her room after getting back from school, journal in hand, and asks me, “what is this?” I start laughing hysterically. I explain that i wanted to know if they were still reading my journal, and obviously my planned worked because here we are. I asked, “do you really think this is real? Unbaptised baby fat? Really?” They were not as amused as I was. This pretty much ruined our relationship for many years to come. But as they say, time heals all, and we are all now on good terms, but sometimes i think about that time i convinced my entire family that I was going to put a   Satanic curse on them. \n\nTDLR: Parents found and read my journal, where I was talking shit about them. Took revenge by convincing them I was going to place a Satnic curse on all of them.",

I do NOT recommend hurting yourself to make a point to anyone, but I was feeling petty and was not in the mood to be talked to in that way.\n\nSo I was being a good little patient and going to the store to get my medications. My Aunt drove me to the store (I can't drive due to seizures and my EDS). So we pull into a handicapped parking spot, I hang up my cripple pass (lmk if calling a handicapped tag this is inappropriate or stuff like that so I can change it and stop calling it that irl) on the back mirror and hop out of the car. And behind us, a typical Karen minivan pulls up and we hear the screeching mating call of a Karen \"excUuUuUse mEeEEE\", I already know what's going to go down. My Aunt seemed annoyed but I turned around with a smile \"hi can I help you?\" in her nasally voice she says \"you're not allowed to park there!\" I fake a confused look \"why not?\" she huffs loudly \"because you're not HANDICAPPED! you look just fine!\" My Aunt is about to go off but I give her a look that says \\*let me handle this\\*, I turn back to Karen and said \"ma'am I am handicapped but it's not obvious\" before Karen spoke I knew what she was going to say and I started mentally preparing myself for what I was about to do. She smiles smugly and says \"prOooVe iT!\". I try to explain that it's not safe to prove it and try to explain what I have but she keeps demanding proof, I'm already exhausted and her voice and attitude made it even worse and pissed me off. So I look her right in the eyes and grab my hip and pull it out of place with a sickening pop/crack, I smile to hide the look of pain on my face \"I park close so stuff like this has a lower chance of happening\". Karen looks like she's going to faint, vomit, or both. I then move my shoulder out of place with the same sickening pop/crack. Karen stumbles back and the disgusted and fearful look in her eyes made it so so so worth it. \"Okay okay I get it stop, that's actually so gross\" While dry heaving she runs back into her car and speeds off. My Aunt quickly helps me into the car so I can put them back in place. My Aunt then leaves me in the car and gets my meds but also gets me my favourite ice cream. After we get home she gets me situated in bed while I eat my ice cream. My Aunt says she's proud because I put Karen in her place but to never do that again.\n\n100% worth it but also hurt a lot and again I do NOT recommend hurting yourself to make a point.",

        "text": "Reading a few stories here and I immediately think of how this year went for me.\n\nA bit of context. I worked for the same company for the last 20 years and recently started thinking about options. I had a second job which I really enjoyed and did really for fun and for a little bit of cash to spend on \"boys toys\"; it was never going to pay my mortgage. \n\nOver the COVID pandemic, we were all sent to work from home and you know what, it worked. Most folks in the team got more done and had a significantly better work life balance. Right at the start though, the company was taken over and that was the start of 2 years of changes. The first was an attempt to cut everyones pay by 10% \"because COVID\". The company is in online payments and COVID was a real money spinner for them. The CEO and CTO bragged that they gave up their salary for 6 months to sweeten the 10% pay cut, what they didn't do was give up theit bonuses or options and the dud really well out of that. (Top tip for CEO or CTOs in Fortune 500 companies, your salary packages are posted publicly, we knew what you got).\n\nRoll the clock forward to this summer, the CTO and CEO are awarded a huge pay rise to \"compensate for the tme they gave up their salary\". At the same time staff were told there was no pey rise forthcoming for them as there wasn't the money to do it. They also cut long service awards so my expected service bonus evaporated. Then they had a town hall meeting, there was a lot of heated discussions on pay and the cuts to the recognition scheme. Then came the sledgehammer, everyone had to switch back to working in the office, there was an option for continued home working but that would require a reduction in salary to reflect the savings made in commuting and time spent commuting. I asked what other options were on the table and was told I could always look for another job.\n\nThe timing of that was perfect. I had been looking into options for increasing my work in my second job and was told I could have as many hours as I wanted.  I made the call as soon as we left the Town Hall, asked to go on full time hours and got approval immediately. The following Monday we all had to go into the office full time again, I walked in, logged into the network and I then handed in my notice. Here's where the fun really kicked in. We were asked to give 3 months notice, but if you gave 1 month there was no legal recourse. I had also carried over quite a lot of vacation from the previous years and had 8 weeks to take. I gave the months notice and requested a month of my vacation immediately. There was a sharp intake of breath and a very shocked face from my manager and the sudden realisation I was out of the door that day. \n\nIf you're going to tell someone to just look for another job, don't be surprised when they already have one. You should also have a plan B in place in case the person leaving was due to meet with a client later that week.",

        "text": "So back in August of 2020, my wife and I decided we wanted to put up a sign to promote our preferred candidate for the upcoming presidential election here in Texas. I wanted to see what my town's ordinances said about what and where we could put the sign up, as we were planning to put a banner on our fence that is very prominent facing traffic that goes along the side of our house, but that is at the edge of our property. The ordinances had a few rules about where the sign could and couldn't be (e.g. don't put them on a utility pole), the max size of the sign(36 sq feet), how high off the ground etc. It also said that political signs would be allowed \"30 days prior to any election\". Note here it didn't say \"the election\" which would have implied that the election had to be related to the sign. As far as I was concerned it could be, as the ordinance said in plain English \"any election\".\n\nSo we ordered a 36 square foot banner off of Etsy, nailed and tied it to the fence on a Saturday in August. The next Monday code enforcement dropped by and said something along the lines \"we had an inquiry about your sign, it isn't in compliance with the ordinance\" and asked us to take it down. I wasn't home at the time, my wife told him that I wasn't home but that I had read the ordinance and it said \"any election\", and that we were in compliance. There was some back and forth. They settled on if you request a sign permit that would give us a month with the sign up then we would be within 30 days of early voting in Texas which is how the town has traditionally interpreted the meaning of \"30 days prior to any election\".\n\nSo I get home from running the errand I was on and my wife tells me what has transpired. I still thought the sign was legal under the ordinance, but to make my wife happy I applied for and was granted the permit.\n\nTwo days later the same code enforcement officer came to our house and said that the town manager had overruled his issuing of the permit and that the sign needed to come down. I told him that I only applied for the permit to make my wife happy and that the sign has always been legal under the ordinance and that the town was not without choices as it could clean up the language in the ordinance. More back and forth. I asked him what the next steps were, you know... do you remove the sign(would have made great footage from my security camera)? Do you cite me(can't go before a judge under the 1st amendment without standing, which means being cited)? etc. etc. He said he would talk to the town manager. I said that I would be happy to discuss it with the town manager.\n\nSo the town manager calls me later that day. Says things like \"most people don't put 36 square foot signs on residential property\". I told him that I wasn't most people. I said that I was following the letter of the ordinance and that the sign was up in accordance with \"any election\" including the fact that several of the 54 primaries are currently happening(50 states + territories + voters overseas), and that those are all \"elections\" for the purposes of the ordinance. He says that he would contact the town's lawyer.\n\nHours later he calls back. I guess the town's lawyer was not busy that day and was able to opine instantly on the matter. He says the town's lawyer thinks the ordinance is enforceable but that they have decided to not take an enforcement action. I told him I still believed I was in compliance, because I was following the \"any election\" provision, but that he was making the right choice, as there was a pandemic going on.\n\nBut I had also been doing some research. Many people think of Texas as very similar to the rest of the south where \"local government is best\". But my understanding of how things work in Texas is that cities and towns can not do things that the state doesn't allow them to do. So things are often enumerated or restricted at the state level.\n\nAnd it just so happens that Texas has a [chapter on political signs](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/EL/htm/EL.259.htm). Title 15 is \"Regulating Political Funds and Campaigns\" and Chapter 259 is \"Political Signs\". 259.003 is Titled \"Regulation of Political Signs by Municipality\" and says in part \"A municipal charter provision or ordinance that regulates signs may not, for a sign that contains primarily a political message and that is located on private real property with the consent of the property owner prohibit the sign from being placed;\". It looks like there are some caveats elsewhere in the chapter such as it applies to signs 36 square feet and smaller etc. But definitely applies to my circumstances.\n\nSo the town's ordinance restricts someone from placing a political sign 30 days before \"any election\", it sure seems like that violates this section of Texas law.\n\nNow armed with some information I went to town council, and spoke at one of the open forums, where residents can address the council on any topic. My town is pretty small, full of people who don't share my political views and the council reflects that pretty well. But I told them about how the ordinance appeared to violate Texas law. I also told them about a recent supreme court ruling from 2015([Reed v. Town of Gilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_v._Town_of_Gilbert)) that set a bit of a surprising precedent. Basically under certain conditions the town might have to survive strict scrutiny when taking enforcement actions on signs and demonstrate a \"narrowly tailored, compelling government interest\" for why certain signs could only be up for short times vs other signs being up for longer times.\n\nAnyway. The town worked with me briefly on this issue. The town's manager did say that the town's lawyer and him would circle up and propose changes to council in the coming months.  In the past two years nothing has happened and the ordinance is still in place, unfortunately.  I have spoken to the council about it many times and they have just ignored it.  I now live in rural Washington state.  My local and state government have laws and ordinances that respect my rights.\n\nAnyway, I hope this post inspires you to get out there and VOTE and also engage with your government at the local, state and national level!  And also to realize that if your rights aren't being respected or championed by those in society around you it is totally OK to move if you are able to.  You can find a place where you can fit in and be respected.",

She's made some really questionable decisions about how we custodians do our jobs. Take Bathroom A. Bathroom A is our busiest restroom and can be impossible to keep clean. So Janice decided to put two people in that restroom. Okay, fine. But she expects us to stay in there at all times.\n\nNow one of my fellow coworkers (let's call her Anna) has just been diagnosed with a kidney stone and as part of her treatment plan, has to drink more water than usual to help pass it. And of course this results in her going to the bathroom more than usual. So we let her. She's a hard worker and one of our best so it's never a problem.\n\nWell a few days ago, Anna and I were assigned Bathroom A. It was pretty busy as it was the weekend. So in the middle of all of this, Anna tells me in a quiet voice that she has to go to the bathroom. I nod and tell her to go ahead. Just then, Janice comes in one one of her rare rounds and sees Anna taking off.\n\nThe resulting conversation goes like this:\n\nJanice: Anna, where are you going and leaving Quiet Borderline to clean this restroom alone?\n\nAnna: (clearly antsy) I have to use the restroom.\n\nJanice: I don't care. You're not leaving and I'm staying here until you go back to work.\n\nAnna: Please, I have to go.\n\nJanice: Then go.\n\nTo quote the Joker: \"Very poor choice of words\"\n\nThe next thing I know, Anna is standing in a large puddle of urine and is crying, Janice jumps back in horrified panic and I'm seeing red. Man was I ready to slap Janice.\n\nI call my foreman to ask him if we could go get Anna a new uniform (we're provided our uniforms) and if I could accompany her to the services building because she was a mess.\n\nForeman: Okay but who will clean the restroom?\n\nI smirk at Janice, who is several shades of red and white \"Janice will since she denied Anna the ability to use the restroom when she needed to. She did say she'd say until Anna went back to work.\"\n\nSo Anna and I took our time getting to the services building, Anna thanking me profusely the whole time. Anna got cleaned up (complete with a shower) and a brand new uniform. I got the satisfaction of knowing Janice had to clean that restroom all by herself.",

        "text": "Sorry for the length.  I tried to give sufficient background for context but it may be… excessive. \n\n\n\nIn my old role (compliance for a financial institution) we used to be split into two groups - Investigations and Alerts.  Alerts did the first level of processing of items that came in and then determined whether they should be escalated for further review (sent to Investigations) or closed out.  Alerts was expected to get through 8-15ish items per day (depending on referral channel and other factors), while Investigations was lucky in some areas to get through 2 per day (some cases could take days or weeks to do).  I worked in Investigations, specifically within Treasury, which was considered the most complex area, and I primarily dealt with the high-scrutiny/high-complexity items like law enforcement referrals.  I was also the main trainer for Treasury, particularly complex cases, and had created all of the training materials and processes.  Additionally, I worked as the point of contact/representative on the procedures management group, so I knew them inside and out.  What it boils down to is that I made myself the keystone species of the department, albeit inadvertently. \n\n\n\nAs happens with any organization, there was an ebb and flow of employees in our area, but for the most part we stuck around because we were treated fairly, enjoyed our work, and had senior leadership who actually tried to understand what we did and why we do it.  We weren’t dealing with people who thought they knew better and who would make arbitrary decisions for the sake of implementing change and saying that they did something.  Sure, it wasn’t perfect, but it worked pretty well. \n\n\n\nThat all changed when they decided to merge Alerts and Investigations together and make everyone do everything.  Things went downhill quite quickly, especially because the leadership that was given control was from Alerts.  As far as they were concerned, a case is a case is a case (it’s not) and you should be able to get through all things quickly (you can’t) and they’re all created equally (they aren’t).  They put undue pressure on folks to get through the caseload far faster than was feasible (if you do it right, anyway) and removed all specialization, which made it incredibly difficult to get into the groove of the work because different areas had different expectations and procedures.  To add to that they promoted people who had no business being elevated (Peter Principle, anyone?) and ignored tenured investigators who should have been first up.  All that did was piss off the good employees and create a whole bunch of Post Turtles in leadership roles. \n\n\n\nAs one would expect, attrition skyrocketed.  They weren’t paying us nearly enough to deal with the bullshit, so people left for both internal and external roles at alarming rates.  When the pandemic hit we were, for the most part, stuck.  Hiring freezes galore, and there’s always a fear of leaving and then getting screwed and being jobless during the disaster that was (is) the world.  \n\n\n\nA bit more background - at work I have always had a reputation for honesty and for speaking my mind, ~~sometimes~~ often to the chagrin of senior leadership.  As far as I’m concerned you can’t complain about something if you don’t try to fix it.   So when everything was at peak awfulness I said something on a call with the aforementioned senior leadership, knowing that it was unlikely anything was going to change but at least I would know I tried.  I was later pinged by one of the managing directors in our overarching department (not up my direct reporting line but in the same organization); we’ll call him C.  I worked with C a number of times over the years.  He had a rocket strapped to his butt and was perfectly content to ride that puppy until he could go no further.  He is definitely a bit of a Yes Man but that’s what generally happens when you’re in that type of role.  I am unlikely to ever become a Yes (Wo)Man because it’s not my personality but it takes all kinds, and you never know what might happen in the future.  \n\n\n\nWhen C pinged me he asked if I could chat and give him some more details about the situation.  I knew I had nothing to lose (see: keystone species) so we got on a call and I explained the problems and my opinions on proposed solutions.  More staffing, revert back to specialization in case types, pay industry standard, have leadership work on acquiring a better understanding of the job so as to be able to make more informed decisions, etc.  Nothing unreasonable, though I knew that it was unlikely any of it would be done.  C’s response?  “Vote with your feet.”  About what I expected but I was impressed that he went right out and said it, especially because we both knew the whole department would be screwed if I left.  I’m sure he figured I would never leave (after all, I had stayed for almost 8 years already, even though the awfulness didn’t truly start until fairly late in the game).  \n\n\n\nFast forward a couple months to summer 2021.  I had been focusing on finding another role (I had been even before talking with C but that gave me renewed incentive); I was being particular about what I applied for because I didn’t want to leave for the sake of leaving, especially knowing that any internal move would mean I was stuck for a year and I didn’t want to risk screwing myself out of something perfect by jumping the gun.  My caution paid off and I was offered an amazing internal opportunity that pretty much fit me like a glove.  I kept my move quiet for a variety of reasons, only telling my manager, but I knew it would eventually make it up the chain.  I just wanted to keep it as quiet as possible for as long as possible.  \n\n\n\nWell, a week or so before I was scheduled to start in my new role I got a ping from C asking me to hop on a call.  He had seen the leave report and wanted to ask me why I was going and whether they could convince me to stay (they couldn’t).  I got on the call, video, and when he asked me why I was leaving I looked at him and said “Well, C, I’m just doing what you told me to do!”  He gave me a cocker spaniel look, complete with head tilt, and I just smiled and said “I’m voting with my feet!”  \n\n\n\nThe satisfaction I got from the look on his face when he made that connection brought me so much joy.  He was so crestfallen.  It was just… *chef’s kiss*",

        "text": " I know this is long, but hopefully it’s worth it. TLDR at the end.\n\nWhile I was a college student in the 80s, I accepted a job as a second-shift Computer Operator at a large regional bank. The job duties were processing all the checks and payments, printing statements and checks, running all the backups, and so on. On the day I showed up for the job, I learned that I wasn’t getting that job but a lower one which physically loaded the check readers, loaded printer paper, signed checks, burst forms, and so on.\n\nThe Lead Computer Operator had apparently threatened to quit if they didn’t promote internally and give the job to one of the current people in the position I just ended up in. (They later got married so you can probably figure out her actual motive.) But, the Department Manager, Mr. Biggs, my boss’s boss, told me that I would be promoted to Computer Operator as soon as anyone left the position.\n\nYou guessed it! Two years later, no one has left the position, and we acquired another regional bank. Our CEO told the CEO of the acquired bank that no employees would be fired so, suddenly, we had an extra Computer Operator on every shift. But, Mr. Biggs insisted I’d still get promoted because he knew I was the most computer-literate employee he had; something he used to his advantage in numerous side-projects which should have been paid at a much higher rate.\n\nSix months later, one of the Computer Operators finally transferred to the Programming Department. I ask Mr. Biggs to promote me to the position and he told me he was working on it. A few months later he finally tells me that they still have too many Computer Operators because of the acquisition and I wouldn’t be promoted until more of them left.\n\nClearly, this wasn’t working, so a few months later another position opens in the Programming Department and I apply for it. Mr. Biggs signed the form allowing me to apply and wished me luck. The interviews went well and Programming wanted to hire me but a few days later the Computer Operator who transferred there told me, privately, that Mr. Biggs went to the head of Programming and asked him not to consider me for the position because I was his “best employee” and he couldn’t afford to lose me. The head of Programming told him, “No. I’m going to hire the best person for the job.”\n\nThe next morning, the HR Director calls me to say that one of the Executive Vice Presidents wants to interview me for the position. She’s flabbergasted because he’s never asked to interview anyone of that level and couldn’t explain why he wanted to now. \n\nAfter the interview, the HR Director called me, apologized profusely, and told me they were giving the position to another candidate because he had a college degree. No, it wasn’t related to the position in any way. The degree was from an unaccredited college which had actually asked me to teach computer courses there, which I’d turned down. \n\nOf course, I knew what had really happened, so I told the HR Director that I hadn’t realized how important a degree was and that I would immediately switch to part-time instead of full time so I could take more hours of classes to finish my degree more quickly. There are no part-time positions in Mr. Biggs department so it meant transferring to the department run by his biggest competitor within the company. She transferred me immediately at the same pay I was making in the previous department and I never worked for Mr. Biggs again.\n\nTLDR: My boss’s boss secretly kept another manager from promoting me because he didn’t want to lose his “best employee,” but the company told me it was because I didn’t have a degree, so I transferred out of his department for part-time work to dedicate more time to pursuing my degree.",

        "text": "The following I posted as a reply in a thread about railroad workers not being able to strike, not very familiar with this subreddit but hopefully you all enjoy:\n\nFor reference I am a US Federal Railroad Administration certified Conductor/Engineer who used to work for a major railroad (Union ______) ending my career in 2018.\n\nWe weren't allowed to strike, so instead of striking we could and often did utilize the 40,000+ rules that all contridict each other for some very sweet malicious compliance. \n\nStory time: John is a great guy, never calls off, been with the company over 20 years. He knows his job well and often will take the time to train (hah) newer switchmen/brakemen/conductors. He is very personable and just a generally easy guy to talk with, he was also our union rep for a long time until his wife became ill so he resigned from those duties.\n\nOne day I heard a manager yelling at him because he was late to a scheduled train during what I would call a pretty major storm. This is the pacific northwest, snow, hale, and rain coming down on very graded terrain. \n\nManager tells him that when he gets to his destination he is going to personally meet him there to counsel him. I hear John utter the words \"You'll be waiting a while\".\n\nNow, to understand this piece of track you have to understand it is very mountainous, and at a single point drops down to a single line of rail between two major intersections of track, very busy but due to the grade only a single train can do it at once.\n\nThis area is also very difficult to do maintenance on in good weather since it requires essentially off-roading mountain roads, with steep cliffs and areas that aren't otherwise easily manageable, nevertheless during this icy storm.\n\nJohn hops in his scheduled train, train takes off, my conductor walks in from outside (and had spoken with John beforehand, they were good friends, like Sunday BBQ with each others families on the regular, friends) he tells me to put my paperwork down, that we aren't going to be going anywhere. Kick my feet up and enjoy getting paid for nothing all shift.\n\nA bit confused, he tells me to watch the line traffic monitor.\n\nSure enough, John knew this choke point, set his train on it, blocking all transfers from most of the west coast, at least the northern portion of the US (Portland, Seattle, and Canada) and stated that due to worsening weather, visibility, and safety that he would not move the train until it was 'safe to do so'.\n\nHit his 12 on duty, then waited another 4 for a ride. (I was sent home after 2 hours of waiting, but could monitor from a phone app and my laptop), I calculated his pay for all this, and the deadhead he had back to our station, and it was close to a $1,000 day for him.\n\nNone of us complained, we get paid regardless of the train status, and he was in fact following the company and the FRAs rules, which are very strict about safety.\n\nEdited to add: John passed away last year due to cancer, but that stretch of track is now referred to as John's pass. (His name obviously changed for story)",

I planned to make a night deposit, so I wanted to clarify if he meant while the bank was open. I got as far as, \"Do you mean...\" when he slammed his hand on the desk and yelled, \"Are you making a deposit today?!\" Cue malicious compliance. I simply answered his question, \"Yes.\" \n\nA couple of days later, he stormed up to my desk and demanded to know why I had not made a deposit the day he asked. It had apparently caused some huge problem with his cash flow. I calmly replied that I DID make a deposit that day, but it had been a night deposit, and that he had not given me a chance to clarify. He clearly didn't like the answer, but dropped it and went off in a huff. I quit not long after that.",

        "text": "This had happened a several years ago now.  I was working in IT on a contract to hire basis for a company that likes to ship things. Standard 60 day to hire full time contract. Another guy with the same deal started a week before me, reverent later.  So we both put in our time and he gets converted to full time. Cool, sounds good, I'll be real soon as well.  But would you know it, between when he went full time and me, there was a big management shake up and they completely forgot to convert me to full time.  I brought this up several times and they first played it off as we'll get around to it, which then moved to you need to work harder to get converted.  Well that's not what was promised when I started working, so I asked if I can start putting in overtime then as there was a hard no for contractors allowed to do overtime.  They told me I needed to work for free to show that I was willing to be converted.  That's a no from me dawg.  First thing I did as soon as I got out of the meeting was emailing my contractor company and explained everything that was going on.  They would back me 100% that if I charged any overtime to them and the company I was contracted too didn't pay it they would be sued out of existence.  I also asked if I can just work my 40 hours a week and call it a day because I'm meeting what was technically in the contract. They said that is fine as well.    \nSo here started my malicious compliance with no overtime, no on call, no extra effort, at 4:00:01 the whole place could be on fire I was nowhere to be found.   I reached my hours for the day/week and was gone. \n\nSo then we were all trained up on ITIL's practices and were suppose to follow them. I took care of 3rd level support and an issue finally made it up to me. I fixed it and closed it out, sent to back to the help desk for them to call the customer and relay everything was fixed. This led to the help desk getting angry with me and complaining to my boss So I asked I thought we were doing ITIL's and first point of contact was to be the last point as well. He told me that no we do not follow ITIL's here. (never mind the training we just did I guess) So i didn't what I do best. From that point on I never updated or closed a ticket that was put into my name. I think I had hundreds of tickets racked up in my queue. See I actually completed the work, but would never touch the ticket. I mean why would I have to? There were no standards we followed.   \n\n\nSo for my final act, around the start of December my boss pulled me into his office and told me I might not have a job at the start of the new year. I shrugged and said ok. I remained quiet but later that day I setup an interview with my friend at another company. This went on for 3 week, never said anything to the boss, but I had a signed offer and was starting my new job after new years. Last day before break I casually come into the office and DBAN'd my laptop. We were suppose to save off important material and reformat laptops when someone left. Oh darn I missed the first part, maybe if there was an actual process. About that time my now ex boss quickly comes into the room flustered.  \"I just got a call from the contracting company! They said you don't work here anymore?\"  \n\"You said I wouldn't have a job, at the end of the year, so I got a different one\"  \n\"But we should have talked about this! Oh my god, where are all your automation scripts you wrote?\"  \n\"On my laptop\" I told him as I stood up and walked out.   \n\n\nA month or two later one of our old co-workers had died and I went to the funeral. My old ex boss was there and he couldn't even look me in the eye. I also heard the guy they hired to replace me was getting furious because he had to go through all my open tickets and every time the customer would tell him that's been fixed.",

        "text": "My first (real) job was scooping ice cream, which largely consisted of me shuffling around behind a standing cooler in the courtyard of a larger establishment. Our business was goat cheese, and I was an extension of that: goat milk ice cream. Our clientele was very sporadic as we lived on an island, so the timing of the ferry was suspiciously similar to that of our busy periods.\n\nI worked 11-5 four days a week, earning minimum wage. Idk if I was on the books or not but I always got paid.\n\nHere's the problem: when 5pm rolls round, I'd tally up sales and the box of change, wash all the scoops, table, cooler, and pack all the cones and cups away inside. The rest of the place would stay open for a few more hours selling cheese and cafe food. However the sun was pretty hot that summer and customers would routinely walk up at 5:05 and ask for icecream only to hear I was closed and I'd direct them to the people running the actual store to scoop for them. This was a huge hassle for the store but I loathed scooping \"just you guys\" and then having people trickle in for 30 minutes.\n\nI brought this up to my boss and asked to extend my shift by 30 minutes so that I could cover the stragglers after 5. I was told to close at 5 and to \"make it more obvious that I was closed.\"\n\nAfter about a week of sitting in the break room and counting change, basically hiding from customers, someone noticed.  I'm signing out and the Big Cheese who owns the entire operation comes up and asks why I'm not serving customers after 5.\n\n\"I'm sorry but I'm only scheduled until 5pm, but if you bumped me to end at 5:30 I'd be glad to stick around!\"\n\nSchedule for next week rolls around and I guess he spoke to my boss, because I suddenly had a extra cushy 30 minutes added onto my shifts from then on. \n\nBought my first computer from that job, good times.\n\nTldr: $5.50 is worth customer satisfaction",

        "text": "Alrighty lads. This has been a chuckle in my team and I think enough time has passed for me to finally post it. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nI work in the events department for a large company. Projectors, microphones, computers, etc. If its required for an event then we handle it and it probably passes through my workflow for helping to organize.\n\nMy department also handles catering for events - while it's not my team specifically, we work side by side. The associate director runs the catering and event coordinators. My manager only runs the AV side - and doesn't report to the associate director (Don't ask - it's a messed up org chart that nobody can make sense of)\n\nDespite not being *specifically* part of my job description, I also do the technical side of getting new staff members online within our system - getting their staff account created and also getting Teams and Onedrive online on their mobile so they can see all their paperwork. And the reason why I am happy to do this is because with the catering team being a revolving door of staff (Normal in my industry), getting them online needs to be done immediately and fast. You can go to the greater IT team to do this, but you can be waiting *days* for them to get it done. Whereas I can do it within five to ten minutes with them. And staff that aren't online on our system can't work (H&amp;S forms are part of this setup), therefore they wouldn't be able to complete the assigned shift (And IT won't touch the request until they show up for their first shift... at which point you'd *then* wait days for them to get onto it... See the flawed logic here?)\n\nRecently, my boss has through another bought of trying to micromanage the hell out of my team. We all hate it but I guess we can just ride this wave out again... The associate director asked me to go to one of our other offices on the other side of the city to setup a group of new staff in one large batch order. My own manager looked at the request, got one of those \"time for some micromanagement shenanigans\" faces.\n\nMe: \"Hey boss, associate director wants me to go to the other office to setup some new staff in the system next week on friday\"\n\nBoss: \"Uhhh nope. I need you here in case something happens OP. Very busy day on that day.\"\n\nMe: \"There's nothing on the roster for that day and I'd still be available remotely...\"\n\nBoss: \"Just write the associate director a document about how to get people setup in the system and he can do it himself\"\n\nMe: \"Uhhh... are you sure? I do it fast because I'm trained on the system and he doesn't. Including travel, I'd only be gone for about 3-4 hours. Writing the document on how to get someone setup in the system would take much longer.\"\n\nBoss: \"Write the document and put everything he needs to know in it. It only needs to be, what, half a page? Can't be that hard.\"\n\n*Everything?* Alright. Cue malicious compliance.\n\n\\-----\n\nWhat my boss expected, was a half page instruction manual on getting a new account created within the system.\n\nI don't think I could have kept it that short even if I tried.\n\nWhat followed was a three day project writing out the instruction manual for how to get someone setup in the system which comprised of 34 pages - not half a page. Large portions of it are troubleshooting steps, accounting for different models of phones and likely fixes when they do weird things (Iphones are great because they *work* \\- the infinite variations of android phones can sometimes throw up strange errors either on the system or within the phone itself). Most of the information in here was collective knowledge I've built up over the years, as well as who else to phone in IT for the most outrageous issues that had to be resolved that I didn't have permissions for and who could generally do it immediately.\n\nI warned the Associate Director that this was going to be a very large technical manual and he should probably read it before heading to the other office.\n\nAD: \"Isn't it half a page?\"\n\nMe: \"My boss said to put *everything* in it\"\n\nAD: \"Oh no\"\n\nWhat followed was the Associate Director attempting to take somewhere between ten to twenty people through this very technically written manual about getting someone setup in the system. To anyone not technically inclined, it could have all been in a different language for all they could understand it... After 30 mins, he called me, put me on speaker phone + camera to the new staff and said \"just do it\".\n\nSitting at my computer, I spent the next 40 minutes getting everyone online (Technical support over a phone can be straining, you all know what I mean) and they were fine to start their shifts. Finally, the Associate Director asks me something in private afterwards...\n\nAD: \"OP, did it need to be this complicated?\"\n\nMe: \"Actually I summarized some sections to make it easier. Didn't want to make it difficult for you - wasnt the intention, but my boss told me to write down *everything* so I did.\"\n\nAd: \"Good to know, thanks\"\n\n\\-----\n\nFollowing the weekend, I was notified that when I was requested to go get a new staff member setup, I should find a time that *I* am available and go do it, irrespective of other tasks. Not sure what happened up top but I think my boss got a very heavy smack for it.\n\n\\-----\n\nTLDR: The associate director of my department asks me to get new staff online at a different office. My boss says I can't go \"Because it would waste too much time\" and instead instructs me to write a document about how to do it. In the event, this 3-4 hour task (Including travel) turns into three and a half days wasted writing a technical document nobody wants to read.",

I know you can't do more syrup, but they usually just fill the rest up with milk.\" \"I can't do more milk, I'll have to leave the space in the cup, is that ok?\" Me: \"ok, fine.\" She proceeds to make my drink and hands it over about half full. I smile and take my cup directly over to the coffee bar they have, grab the EXACT milk she had behind the bar and filled the rest of my cup. I said \"cheers\" with a smile, put my straw in, and walked out the door.",

        "text": "I am dealing with a government official that is not playing fair, has a personal vendetta and my rights are being violated, I've already humiliated him at an appeal once, where the lawyer for the city of Akron sounded like he was my lawyer and they dropped the issue but this yard cop can't take a loss.\n\nI have excellent records, videos and audio of just about every interaction I am going to describe.\n\nI own a property in Akron Ohio. This is the worst looking house on the street admittedly (but still better than 90% of akron) (on purpose because every time I made an improvement they would raise the taxes). One of the neighbors (5 houses up the road) thinks he lives in a high end area or something but it's still the ghetto. I have had the city show up every time I do something, put up a fence, shed (no permit needed for either) etc and now I know it's this one person complaining.\n\nI have 2 old shuttle buses that I converted into RV's parked in my driveway. I was given junk vehicle notices on these vehicles after this 1 particular neighbor complained. I tried to appeal with the nuisance department, aka Jeff Ross. He did everything he could to deny my appeal. He lied and told me the law department already decided I couldn't do anything and that I was going to start being fined $150 a day. I did not have a money order or check with me so I left to get one and when I came back he started escalating the situation. I recorded it from this point on video. He started yelling at me to move my truck and trailer or he was going to call his friends at the police, generally screaming at me. They have a small parking lot so I had to park the 40ft+ truck and trailer I was driving in the middle for the moment.\n\nI moved my truck and tried to go in and that's when he told me I'm not welcome there because I was acting crazy. When I was not at all, he was with his pig cop escalation techniques. This was all a ploy to try to deny my appeal.\n\nSo I had to mail in my appeal for that. I 100% believe that he would have thrown it away except that I had started contacting his bosses. I emailed just about everyone listed on the akron government website explaining the situation and the video of him acting insane. Finally about 2 months later I was granted an appeal. \n\nAt this appeal, which they recorded on audio, and I also recorded on audio. The nuisance guy, Jeff Ross, was absolutely humiliated. I presented that my vehicles are legally titled and registered as motorhomes, which he didn't want to hear anything about originally (I tried to tell him), he just wanted to be right and win. The Cities own lawyer sat next to me and sounded like he was my defense lawyer. The only time the yard cop got to speak is when everyone introduced themselves. His face was red the entire time sitting across from me with an angry look. He took a huge loss. Everything he tried to tell me was clearly a lie. \n\nFast forward to a few weeks later, this yard cop Jeff Ross is on my security cameras walking around my backyard. My backyard is very private, it has privacy fencing, and nothing is visible from the street. I have some extra vehicles I keep parked back there. Couple honda civics, and trucks with good engines I keep for future uses. I am very certain he had no warrant. I was not home and I'm usually not there as I travel a lot. I called the police to go there and tell him to get off of my property with no warrant, they showed up too late as he had already left. The officer called me and said \"oh yeah we've dealt with him before haha\" which I took as they know he's a goof that completely disregards everyone's rights. \nIt turns out he stole several sets of keys out of my vehicles. I would just put them on the seats since they're parked (securely) in my backyard. I filed a police report as soon as I discovered this. It was just today actually, I had thought about it when I first showed up to get the notices but drove away and forgot and thought \"he wouldn't do that\"....well he fucking did\n\nI am served with more notices from the \"department of neighborhood assistance\" regarding my house. They're trying to tell me to paint my house, which I have begun to comply with, it's currently mostly pink, they're trying to say it's condemned. It is probably the worst house on that street admittedly, but it's better than 90% of Akron.  There's a whole laundry list of bullshit they're trying to say, like fix my driveway? like it's an HOA. He incorrected cited his own code on \"broken windows\" on the paper, this is how petty they're being. No windows are broken, I have window air conditioner unit installed in an upstairs window. The code just says they need to be watertight etc.\n\nI called and they said they \"got an anonymous tip\"...I wonder who that is? They came out with Jeff Ross.\n\nAs far as the vehicles go, I can move some of them and get current registrations for the rest and fight to get an appeal again and they'll drop it, we'll just keep playing these games. And I'll finish painting my house pink. However I really don't feel like he had a right to be in my backyard in the first place. That felt like an unlawful search. I also feel like my 14th amendment right to equal protection is being compromised as I am clearly being targeted with retaliation and a personal vendetta now because he was humiliated. I have him on video SMILING at my security camera as they stapled the papers to my house. And he was taking pictures of the RV's again? Even though that was just dropped (and their papers don't mention them this time).\n\nYou can follow the saga on my TikTok @AlexKnappenberger",

        "text": " So at one point years ago our company had a pretty close relationship with one of the big oil companies, one of the ones with a gas station on every other corner, just so you know the sort of company I mean.\n\nWell one day we're in a meeting with our buddies from the oil company, and they start talking about this project they want to do next season.   All these sorts of drilling operations that we were involved with took place way up above the artic circle, so everything gets planned years in advance since the logistics and the weather are all such a problem.\n\nAnyway for this project they want to try they're going to need some specialized equipment that they don't already have, equipment that didn't actually exist yet.   We said \"No sweat, but you'd better order it right now because there's going to be a 9 or 10 month lead time getting it built\"\n\nSo this is where we come in.   They hadn't actually made this an official project yet, so despite having all the money in the world they had no way to spend any of it on this thing.  They asked us to order the equipment instead,  and promised to buy it off of us, with our healthy markup included, once it arrived.\n\nThis was a big deal for us, it was about $750k worth of machinery to order.  Just to make the down-payment to get the order placed I had to use a line of credit against my house, so needless to say there was a lot on the line.   We went ahead and took the plunge though, and true to form about 6 months later the oil company changed their mind and announced that they weren't doing that project after all.\n\nThey told us not to freak out though, that they'd made a promise and they'd buy the machinery anyway. They'd just use it somewhere else was their plan.   So we invoice them, they pay us, we pay the manufacturer, and we breathe a huge sigh of relief.   But a few weeks later these four machines arrive on  our doorstep, each about the size of a railroad car so they're not exactly easy to move around or store someplace.   So we call our oil company friend up and say \"Your machines are here, where shall we send them?\"   \"Uhhhhhhhhhh,....\"  They'd never thought this part through it seemed.    They asked if we could store them somewhere, so we rented a warehouse, marked it up, and invoiced every month for about three years.    A few times a year we'd say, \" You realize your machines are still here, right?\"   It's such a big company though with so much going on that they just didn't care about the money.\n\nBy the time three years were up all the original people involved had moved on to other jobs or projects, and finally somebody called up asking why were invoicing them for all this machinery storage.  We explained the situation and they said \"Well we don't even want those machines anymore, why don't you keep them and quit invoicing us\"   Stunned silence for a second, then I said \"OK, no problem\"   \n\nSo we sold the machinery, put the money in the bank, and that was that.   So we never set out to do anything malicious here, but at the end of the day this whole episode cost somebody about $900k, so somehow I think it counts.",

My boss randomly schedules people for 12 hour shifts because they can't hire people and keep them, which is something they could do if they increased their wages to a reasonable rate. Looking for a new job to replace this one and working a second job already. I can't afford to quit right now because I'm also in the process of paying off a debt balance. I told my boss I could no longer work the unannounced 12 hour shifts because of my new job in the evenings, but she posted the rest of the month's schedule last night with another 12 hour shift on it. When I told her I had a second job, she retorted with \"well, this is healthcare (I am not certified, just work as an aid in am assisted living facility), and you are legally obligated to stay here if no one shows up for their shift following yours.\" 1. Pretty sure that mandate doesn't provide for employees to use their staff to work the jobs of more than one person, and 2. It isn't an issue of me covering someone who didn't show up, it's just that she decided to schedule me without asking one time about whether I could work those hours or not. This job has everyone who works there furious at this point because of all shades of grey concerning this problem. Would love some suggestions and resources. Thanks and much love.",

        "text": "I used to work at a home health facility that did some pretty terrible things but that’s another story. I was hired as a caregiver but my role was more of a combined performing the tasks of a caregiver and administrative tasks such as payroll, filing documents, contacting people of importance for our clients and facility, etc. all for minimum wage I might add, but this was my first job so I wanted to do the most so I could use them as a reference in the future.\n\nMy boss is not very tech savvy and doesn’t really understand the most efficient way to go about things. For example she had us clock in and out using an Excel sheet rather than using a payroll system because it was “too complicated to set up.” Nonetheless, one of the tasks she gave me was to send out requests for work to people applying on a certain job website. Rather than post the business on the website, she would just send requests to people that labeled themselves as looking for work. She thought this could save the company money and that this was faster than waiting for people to apply. If you’ve applied through a job listing website and received those prewritten, “check out this job opportunity at X company!” We were basically doing that. \n\nI thought that it would be more beneficial to sort the potential recruits in certain categories by using the sites keyword finder to look for applicants with terms like “caregiver” or “behavioral-health” to yield a better pool of candidates. Doing this method of mindlessly sending out emails I would pump out around 4-5 hundred emails to qualified candidates and we’d receive maybe 5-6 interested applicants and of those applicants no one was interested in the job because of the abysmal amount of work that we had to put in. My boss was not happy and asked me to show her how I’d been doing this process. She told me I had to pick up the pace because “I didn’t hire you to slack off” but I wasn’t, I was making sure we only got applicants that I thought would be either interested in this line of work or were experienced to give the residents the care they needed.\n\nShe wanted more applicants? Fine. I turned off the filter and started sending out requests to ALL available people. Had a degree in engineering? Here’s a request. Past work experience as a line chef in a 5-star restaurant? Here’s a request. I sent out over 2 thousand of those pre-written emails in a day and before anyone asks, the site had this function that allowed us to put in a prewritten job description as well as my boss’ contact information so all I had to do was hit send. \n\nMy boss came back near the end of my shift and ask how many emails I was able to send out, I told her “ a little over 2 thousand.” She smiled and said “do you see what you can do when you put your mind to things.” I rolled my eyes and clocked out. \n\nThe next day my boss looked drained. Remember when I said her contact information was on those prewritten job descriptions? It turns out she had been receiving notifications non-stop either through email when people reject or accept the job request or when people call her to inquire about the job. She told me “why do I keep getting calls from people who have no experience in healthcare about this job? I just got a call from a security guard asking if the position was still available.” Keep in mind she can’t just put her phone on do not disturb because she’s literally running a home health facility so a call from a doctor or pharmacist regarding a change in patient care cannot be ignored. I guess she didn’t get a lot of sleep that night but that’s not my problem so I continued to send more requests that day. By the end of the day I had to apply a filter that screened candidates who had not been active on the site for over a month just to get some new names to send to. \n\nI left shortly after this and I still have that prewritten email that was sent to me before I started working there. I hope they are still as short-staffed as ever.",

        "text": "About 5 years ago I started a streaming radio station and leased a building on a busy downtown corner in a city of about 17,000.   It also included music recording studios, pay-per-hour mixing rooms and a studio for doing interviews with local personalities and elected officials.   It went over really well, especially after we added multiple remote broadcasts for county high school football and basketball games, including several state championship games.    Since our preferred music was classic rock, I had a huge vinyl sign made which covered the entire front window, designed with tie dye and psychedelic art work.      People loved it.   Unfortunately, the local Sign Review Board in the city was offended because I had not asked for their blessing.  In fact, the sign was too big because the rule required window signs to be no more than 50% of the window dimensions.     Ok, that was my fault, but I pointed out that there were two large panes of glass, one above the other, and that if you consider the total surface area, the sign was only 66% of those dimensions.    I think they were butt hurt by my tendency to argue with them.   I had spent over $1,500 for the sign and was annoyed by some arbitrary rule.\n\nIn the end, I relented and removed the sign during the daytime so everyone could see. That night, I covered the window from inside with generic cardboard boxes upon which I had spray painted (with orange reflective paint) “THE CITY DID NOT LIKE MY SIGN!”    Initially, they claimed it was non compliant with their rules, but since they only controlled business signs, they lost that battle.  The cardboard stayed in place for six months until they offered to give me a variance for another somewhat smaller sign.  \nI left the cardboard in place for another six months, during which the city asked my landlord to talk with me.  He declined.   Even the mayor stopped by to visit, hoping to find some resolution.  I said I would be glad to remove the cardboard upon receipt of $1,500 from the city.     \n\nAt the end of the lease, I relocated to a bigger place with bigger windows in front.    I left the old place with the cardboard in the window.",

He argued for her, saying that his department's productivity would tank if they did this, but the hammer was brought down. Once he told her, she showed up at 0800 and left at 1700 - never did an extra minute of work.

For folks unaware, conduct is a fairly complex part of higher education where we have to comply with the college policies, federal laws, state laws, and various court rulings. \n\nOne of our policies was that if a student was a threat to the safety of the campus, we could remove them temporarily fr the dorms, from a class, or from the entire campus. Our policy said we should be careful to only remove students from areas where they present a risk. That is basically a fancy way of saying \"don't kick them out entirely if removing from the dorms or class is enough.\"\n\nThe prior five or six times we thought a student was a risk, they were removed removed from campus entirely. I hated this since the students weren't threats to classmates sometimes. \n\nSo my turn comes around to decide if a student is a risk or not and how to proceed. I decide she did present a risk to the dorms (possibly selling drugs) but not the rest of campus since all the sales allegedly were in her dorm room.\n\nThe college lawyer was not please with this. He calls the Dean of Students, the dean calls my director, my director calls me. Since my decision may bias my director when he meets the student later, general counsel says I can't discuss the case with director, and to look for an email from general counsel.\n\nGeneral counsel starts bearing down on me, asking for policy citations, my rationale, asking if I considered the police reports (which I hadn't been given prior to hearing the students side), and saying the student was \"known to sell in the dorms for years\". \n\nI refused to change my decision and general counsel got furious. He tried to drop some \"orders\" but couldn't since I don't report to him at any point. Plus, I had policy on my side. Breaking them opens up all sorts of lawsuit potential.\n\nBut, tired of his lambasting, I decided to offer some compliance. \n\n\"General, You clearly have an outcome in mind. Send me the language you want in the letter to remove the student from campus entirely and I will send it on your behalf.\"\n\nHalf an hour later he replies that I do not have his permission to use his name on anything and that he will speak with the Dean. \n\nI never heard back from general counsel before he was let go during the pandemic and have his email tacked up by my desk to remember the time I outplayed a lawyer.",

        "text": "I worked at a job that would have us claim ½ day per-diem for anything over 4 hours away from town or a whole day per-diem for anything 8 hours or more away from town/shop.  Crew leads didn’t get per diem they had corporate cards to use for all their meals and hotels.  Occasionally the crew lead would buy food for the crew, usually just one meal but sometimes two.  Sometimes the lead would buy us food at a gas station and sometimes it would be at a restaurant.  The only company rule was that if your crew lead purchased your meals then you should not check the box to receive per-diem.  The crew lead would remind people each time he used his card for them that he had annotated in his log that they should not claim per-diem that day.  As an unwritten rule guys just tried to never spend more than the lead so they knew they wouldn’t be questioned on how much they were spending.\n\nOne week we were sent to a different state than we normally work in and the job pushed for 4 days so we were just stranded there waiting to perform the job.  Day 4 the crew lead is tired of being away from home for a job that was supposed to take 2 days and we hadn’t even started yet so he decides that everyone is as home sick as he is so he is going to take us out to breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  For dinner that night we went to a steakhouse.  He ordered a filet mignon with sides and added on a lobster tail for  another $10.  That sounded good to the other two guys on the crew so they ordered the same.  For some reason crew leads always felt the need to be just a little bit higher status than everyone so the lead decided to throw in another $10 tail add-on for himself.  I’m not a big lobster fan and just wasn’t feeling like steak that day so I order the king crab.\n\nFast forward three weeks we are all in the manager’s office and he starts ripping into us about how much we spent on expenses and how we shouldn’t be going way over the amount they pay us for per-diem when the lead is buying the food.  I said that I thought the lead was responsible for anything he charged to his card and that he offered to buy so none of us were going to say no.  The manager exploded with “do you know how many times I have eaten steak and lobster on the company dime?”  I replied, “Judging by your tone, my best guess would be zero.” accompanied by what I now know was probably an unnecessary half grin.  “THAT’S RIGHT I’VE NEVER HAD STEAK AND LOBSTER ON THE COMPANY CARD!”  Keep in mind this guy could put whatever he wanted on his card … apparently he just had never chosen steak and lobster.  We were a good crew , with years of experience so he wasn’t going to fire us over a meal and we knew that so yeah… admittedly we pushed the boundaries sometimes in more ways than just meals.   In the end he told us  “Well guys, I’ve got bad news for you, you were already over your per-diem limit from the first two meals so you’re paying back the cost of the steak and lobster and we will just forget all about it. Nobody needs any formal (written) reprimands.  Deal?”  My half grin returned and I said “Man sucks to be you guys!” jokingly to the rest of the crew and the boss gave me a puzzled look and said “You’re not getting out of this”  He had seen multiple filets and lobster tails all on the same receipt so I knew where he was headed … but like I said earlier….. We liked to push things a bit.  I told him that I didn’t have steak and lobster.  He slammed the receipt on his desk and said, \\`\\`The leads turn in the receipts!”  I said yeah I know and pointed at it.  “Look right here I had the king crab”  He turned beet red “You think this is a joke?!?!”  I had worked with the guy for years, so we were comfortable.  I said “Relax it was just a joke, I'll pay it back.”  CouldI have gotten away with not paying it?  Sure.  But we did spend more than we knew we should that week and got paid 12 hours a day doing nothing in a hotel room while we waited on the job to start \n\nAfter that a company email went out with specifics that crews could not exceed that per diem dollar amount on corporate cards and if we were worried about the difference in the meal price and per diem price then we were to buy the meal ourselves and claim the full per diem.  Really that was always the rule but now it was set in stone.",

        "text": "I once worked for a company that provides therapy to children. The company owner was not licensed/credentialed to do this but I am so he hired me. I got hired, did my job, supervised the other workers, kept all files electronically, and kept the data up to date. (Everything was HIPAA compliant.) As time passed I found out he was committing insurance fraud. I knew I wanted to report him and quit. However, due to the type of therapy I do, I didn’t want to leave the clients without therapy. They didn’t do anything wrong. I decided to give my boss 4 weeks notice so he could hire someone else and I could transfer care properly. My boss didn’t like this plan or the fact that I wanted to quit so he terminated me on the spot. I thought this was reckless of him seeing that now he had NO ONE on his staff who could legally supervise the therapy and sign off on clinical notes. I was the only one who could. When he fired me he started slandering my name and telling lies about me. I work in a small area where everyone in my field knows of everyone else in the field and I wasn’t about to have my reputation tarnished due to his lies. I hired an attorney to write a cease and desist letter. It was sent to him certified mail. He didn’t like this either. He reached out to me and said the company needed all of their materials back as well as client data. He said he would only accept it in certified mail. Of course I wanted to send the books and materials I had back to him as well as transfer the data to him, but it didn’t make sense to send hard copies of the data. It would be a lot easier to securely email the graphed data I had. It would also make it easier on whomever took over my caseload as the data system and graphs would already be set up for them. I tried to explain this in my email reply but he wasn’t having it. He replied “I will no longer reply to you. I told you to send all materials in certified mail and that’s what I expect to happen.” Cue malicious compliance. I printed all of the raw data and graphs I had. This ended up being about 200pages worth of information. When it printed it looked all wonky and extremely difficult to read across that many pages. As I was packing the books, materials, and 200 pages of printed data into the box to be sent, I accidentally dropped it and the papers scattered everywhere. I picked them up but they were all out of order and impossible to tell how to put them back in order, so I just boxed everything up out of order and sent it to him certified mail with signature. I know he received the package. I don’t know what he had the person he hired after me do because what was sent to him was unusable, hard to read prints of the data. The only thing that I think could have been done was to have the new person recreate the entire system, decipher the order of the 200 pages of data, and input it manually. This would take many months!\nMaybe next time he won’t be such a dick and he’ll listen when his employee says it doesn’t make sense to send hard copies of the data.",

        "text": "This is a small &amp; stupid yet very lengthy example of MC but it felt like a huge win for me at the time &amp; still does (I was a child, maybe 9 or 10).\n\nI'm an only child, not much extended family, and both parents were certainly doing their best (having themselves been poorly treated growing up), but sometimes a person's best is still not ideal. \n\nI grew up with the kind of parenting style where the kid can never win, there was always some sort of power trip. E.g., physical punishments for no clear reason, that would increase in severity if I so much as asked what I'd actually done wrong ('you are never to question me'). I had to follow weird rules to the absolute letter that didn't make logical sense, but only applied to me. My dad was the most controlling, and would often try to intimidate me (someone once said he had 'small man syndrome' and at the time I guess I was the only one smaller than him). I would cop it if I did not do exactly what he had said, in exactly the way he said it. Being pretty bright, I learnt to find loopholes in his rules and he couldn't say anything about it if I exploited them because I'd technically done what he'd asked. This story is about one of those times. I was careful not to do so too often in case he stopped being super literal. \n\nTo set the scene some more: I was a neglected child. My parents were the right-wing Christian hippy anti-vax type, in the sense that I was 'homoeopathically vaccinated' (but honestly they wouldn't make sure I took the full course of what's essentially sugar pills, so I didn't even have the claim of being 'homoeopathically vaccinated' to my name). With the ironic exception of homoeopathy, suger in all its forms was the devil, and at some points I remember not even being allowed things like apple juice because it apparently made me hyper and run around a lot. I grew up on goats and soy milk, not cow's milk because it 'leaches calcium from the bones'. I couldn't be myself (I've since learnt I'm naturally peppy, so you have to understand I was fed in a way that discouraged this). Our house was so quiet you could hear a pin drop on the other side of the house. I had high anxiety and was depressed at a fundamental level. I wasn't encouraged to go on play dates with school friends. I wasn't allowed barbies in case I tried to be too sexy. I wasn't allowed to watch Sesame Street because 'Oscar the grouch has a bad attitude and it might rub off' onto me. I would get asked by kids in my class if I was anorexic and I didn't even know what that meant. \n\nOn the rare occasions I received lollies or chocolate as a gift or prize, they'd go up to the very top of the pantry out of reach (but within eyesight) for a time when I deserved to enjoy something a little special. They stayed up there for years, typically that pile was only ever added to. Maybe a couple of times I remember being allowed to select a single item (literally, a single lolly from a party favour lollybag kind of thing).\n\nOccasionally on holiday I'd get to have something yummy as a treat, but it was usually my mother sharing something with me in a close and secret way and my dad would never know. \n\nOne morning on holiday, we were having toast for breakfast. I had two pieces of toast on my plate. On the table was nice proper jam, as well as the usuals (eg Marmite, despite being Australian). As expected, I was not permitted jam in everyday life, and I knew never to ask. But we were on holiday, and it was proper jam, and I hadn't done anything wrong lately, and I thought not being allowed to have jam once was stupid. \n\nI asked, and was told no. I asked again, adding 'but we're on holiday, and I never get to have jam, please?' My mother conceded, saying something like 'oh come on, we rarely go away and it's lovely jam with real fruit' but it was my dad that decided this stuff. Eventually, he conceded. 'yes, okay. But you can only put jam on ONE piece of toast'. I thanked him and repeated, 'I can only --put? the jam --on one piece of toast? --with my knife?', he said yes. I clarified again and he said yes. So I did. But he hadn't specified the quantity, or the manner in which I had to eat it. I grinned. This big, shit-eating grin. I put heaps of jam on that one piece of toast. He tried to stop me but I reminded him what he'd said. I took the other in my hand and smooshed them both together. His eyes bugged out of his head. When I pulled them apart, both pieces had the perfect amount of jam. I said 'oh wow! I thought I wanted to have my toast as a sandwich actually, but I changed my mind. Oh well'. I was then able to enjoy two delicious jam toasts. \n\nThe look on his face was magical. He was angry and tried to tell me off. I reminded him that he'd already confirmed a few times that I could only use the knife, to put jam on only the one toast. He was flustered, because I'd beaten him. My mother had a very amused look on her face and I think she was a little proud. He couldn't punish me directly for having too much jam as he hadn't specified the quantity. Technically I was within the rules.\n\nI can't remember what happened afterwards, I wouldn't be surprised if I somehow copped extra for an unrelated thing. Most of my childhood is a weird blur. But there is always a silver lining. I learnt to be very quick witted. I am very good at noticing discrepancies, logical gaps and loopholes. I only exploit them if I think the person /their stance is objectively ridiculous, and even then, rarely - it's a power that should only be used for good.\n\nThanks for reading.",

We have a service called \"brake inspection\" that is free. i get .25 hour commission on it. although with this company we only get paid commission if our commission earnings is greater than our hourly guarantee and it's averaged for a whole week.\n\nso this week i'm too far behind on commission to make any. i'll just get my hourly. A car rolled in with a complaint of brake squealing. this is pretty common and is not a serious concern usually, but people want something done so i'll sell them brakes if they want to waste $600 to get less noise. anyways i put the car in the air and spun the back wheel and it made a pretty bad squeal. the wear indicator seemed to be the cause. it'll rub on the rotor when the pads are too low. also i could see the rotors were really scored pretty deep. just from that alone i knew it needed rear pads and rotors and i would have just quickly checked if the fronts were really bad so i could suggest that as well. before i could even do that my boss says \"take the wheels off. do a REAL brake inspection. measure EVERYTHING\"\n\nque MC. Now like i said i'm not making commission this week so it doesn't matter to me if i sell work or just hang out. so I pull up the specs for the brake system on that car and i get to measuring EVERYTHING. about 45 minutes later my boss comes by and i've measured 1 set of pads and rotors. thickness at 8 points. parallelism, runout. pad thickness at 4 points. taper long-wise, across and at angles. he asks how it's looking. i mention the rotors are within spec for thickness but out of spec for runout (warped) and parallelism. and the pads are cracked. basically saying it's good but it's not. not a real answer. he comes back after about 90 minutes total and i'm about to start the last wheel. the customer has grown tired of waiting and he asks me if i have a recommendation. i say it might need front brakes, and probably needs rear but i'm not done measuring. he comes back a couple minutes later and says the customer decided he wants to leave. just finish the inspection and roll it out.\n\nso i finish up, i recommend rear brakes and suggest front brakes. the customer comes over to get car from me and says he might come back monday. pretty sure we lost the sale.\n\nlater one of the lube techs is bantering with him about how measuring everything (just what is normally on the inspection sheet) takes at least 15 minutes and the boss is saying it should take 5-10 minutes just as i walk in and he says \"not an hour\" and gives me an accusing look. i just reply \"you said measure everything\".",

        "text": "I work in an office building, think maze of cubicles in a floor rented by the company but owned by the building. My supervisor is a warden wannabe, and for that we'll call him Warden.He patrols the cubicles looking for any excuse to verbally degrade anyone. Phone buzzing? He'll pay you a visit. Getting up for the bathroom? He'll be waiting for you to get back, you get the picture. Recently the building moved us to the first floor to make some repairs to what I believe was the sprinkler system and A/C. We were the smallest company on the floor so we got put into what I assume used to be some room to house custodial or mechanical supplies. Its small, nearly all concrete, and smells like chemicals and rust. In the new floor there's a hole in the wall I'm up against. It's an ugly concrete indented hole. It's like someone cut a 1 foot by 1 foot by 1 foot cube out of the wall. I hate wasting space so I asked the warden if I could put up a small poster to cover it up. He immediately told me it was against company policy and that I should \"check company policy before asking such stupid questions\". Cue Malicious Compliance. I contacted HR and asked them the rules on plants (really I just walked over and asked nicely), they replied that as long as the plant wasn't agregious in size or in poor health plants were allowed. A few days after Warden and I's conversation I had put a small potted plant of  ragweed in the hole. If you aren't familiar with ragweed its a pretty bad allergen, and wouldn't ya know it but Warden has an allergy to pollen and this plant triggered it. He was reaming when he saw it and yelled at me to get rid of it but I told him I checked with HR and it was approved. He ended up leaving in the early afternoon due to feeling \"unwell\". Warden avoided my area for a while after that. The ragweed ended up growing to be about a foot tall before I planted it in a bigger pot on my back deck where it flourished for the rest of the season. I know it's not as intense as some of the other stories in here but I'm just so glad to finally get my chance to get one on warden after all he's done to me",

Find a service, then comb through my contacts I made from previous opportunities. \n\nI get a call today from my boss who is concerned that I am spending too much time on BD (even though it’s in my job requirements) and have been performing my primary duties ahead of time and correctly. All told, maybe spending 1-2 hours a week doing market analysis. My 4 opps I got contracted are worth around 50-60m in annual rev for us. \n\nSay no more. During my last two reviews, when they ask for market updates, I just let them know nothing to share. Also, getting an extra 1-2 hours of not having anything to do is nice!",

        "text": "This happened while doing fieldwork in Alaska. I was managing the crew and bunking with them and one morning my roommate was really dragging and kept shutting her alarm off. This was her first time doing fieldwork and it was clear very early on that she was extremely under qualified. I decide to wake her up and she flips out. We’re already going to be at least 20 minutes late into the field but she gets up and comes into work.\n\nWe’re on lunch and I’m making casual conversation and she says “don’t talk to me, you ruined my day,” and has a tantrum over her morning zen being interrupted. I’m annoyed because we’re already going to be in the field later because of this and by slacking in the morning and during pack up time it made more work for the rest of us. \n\nSo I stick her with another worker that afternoon and dig a hole and drop a duece since we didn’t have a porto potty. I didn’t have any TP because the area was considered leave no trace. We’re also in an area where there are a lot of grizzly and moose so that was always on the back of the mind to be careful. \n\nI go back to my site and half an hour goes by and she comes in on the walk-in talkie panicked and that I need to see something. I come over and there she is sweating over my big old pile of poop something had dug up, swearing up and down that it was fresh bear poop and that it wasn’t safe. \n\nGiven the earlier request though, I didn’t feel the need to correct her and shrugged and told her coworker, who was pretty chill, that the sooner we finished the sooner we could leave. She was extra efficient that day, we finished on time for once, and she spent the rest of the week freaking out about bear safety.",

        "text": "I’m an architect and my company has this client that drives me nuts. We went over and over his project to make sure it was exactly what he wanted. Turned the drawings over to him and let him know that he’s all set.\n\nThen he starts to build his project. I knew there would be some questions because it was a complex project. But I don’t think a month has gone by where he hasn’t come back to us with a change. And they aren’t needed changes either, for instance once he changed from the copper pipe we specified for plumbing to a plastic pipe. He didn’t say anything to us, just made the change. When the inspector came to do his job the inspector insisted that we be contacted for a letter or a revision because what we called off wasn’t installed. Since he waited until the inspection and can’t move forward without it, his project is at a stop until we do our part. So we either have to drop everything for him, or he bugs us 2 - 3 times a day asking for it and complaining that his project is stopped.\n\nSo this week another one comes in. This one has two parts. Part A I have to send somewhere. Part B I can do myself. But here’s the thing, part B at least a little depends on Part A. So I want to wait to send it. He doesn’t like this. So my boss tells me to send it anyway and gets short with me.\n\nSo, I do Part B assuming Part A isn’t going to change, and then I put the files on my computer desktop. Today is Friday. So I wait until 5:01, and then I send the files. The city is now closed and he’s going to have to wait until Monday to call for the second inspection. And knowing the way the scheduling works, Monday will probably be booked already. Made me feel a little better.",

        "text": "  \n\nWhen I was 20, I got drafted into the army (I live in The Netherlands, and this happened in the 80s). I got trained to be an ambulance driver. 2 months of general training and how to drive a Landrover, and two months of medical training. After that, I was ready to take on any medical emergency that came my way :-P.\n\nAfter my training, I got placed in a Staff Support Platoon. A mismatch of different roles that are there to support the higher army staff in whatever they need. Make coffee, admin, drive them around, Tech support etc. etc. I was their ambulance driver. It was probably helpful when we were at war, but they had no use for me during peacetime.\n\nAfter I got settled on the base where I got stationed, I was called in by my lieutenant. Telling me, I had been volunteered to work at the small local military post on our base. I was ok with it, as it gave me something to do during the time I had to serve in the army. It was a small post with a clinic, one permanent Doctor and 1 drafted right out of medical school, and several other grunts like me. Downstairs was our clinic and a few rooms to treat patients. Upstairs about 12 beds for patients who were sick, but not bad enough that they had to go to a real hospital. We worked at the clinic and took care of the patients upstairs. And maybe 2-3 times a week, I had to pull out with the ambulance we used. More often than not, for a planned trip to transport a patient to or from an actual hospital.\n\nI started with the rank of soldier, and I was expected to end my 1-year career at the rank of corporal. As you can imagine from the title. That never happened.\n\nI did not hate working at the post. On the contrary, I actually felt I did something useful. And while I was stationed at the post, I learned many practical medical skills, having other soldiers to practice on. But it was a waste of my time. I wanted to start my career in IT, and this was holding me back. I also did not care much about hierarchy or ranks. I respected my fellow army men and women for who they were, their actions, and how they treated others. Not by the number of bars, stars or stripes. And being an actual medic on our base, I got away with that. We had no role calls, and I slept in a 2-person bedroom instead of the 12-person one my platoon mates had to use—no inspections, no military training and wearing white instead of green. \n\nAnyways, to the malicious compliance.\n\nI was tending to a patient at the clinic. He and his buddy had walked into a door (their words), and it had a glass window that shattered and cut them both up. One pretty bad, and he was treated by our Doctor in one of the rooms as he needed quite a few stitches. I had to stay in the clinic. And as the other soldier only had minor cuts, I treated him on the spot. As no other medical staff was available at that time. The slightly larger cuts, I glued shut. For others, a band-aid would suffice. He was sitting in one of the chairs, and I was on one knee in front of him, taking care of a cut on his leg as I heard somebody walk into the clinic.\n\nWithout looking up, as I was holding a glued cut together with my fingers until it had set, I politely asked to please have a seat and that I would be right there.\n\nColonel: “Do you know who I am? I am the base commander. Colonel SoAndSo.” \n\nYes, he actually said that. I can still hear it in my head 35 years later. His booming indignant voice. Full of air of how important he was.\n\nI was not impressed at all, mostly annoyed by his attitude and told him, “Congratulations! Please have a seat, and I will get to him once I have finished treating the cut I was working on.”\n\nThat was not what he wanted to hear, and he started chewing me out. Finally, I was done with the cut, let go of my fingers and got up. Ignoring his barrage, I asked him how I could help. \n\nColonel “I need to speak to the Doctor! I have an appointment.”\n\nOk, not an emergency. I explained to the Colonel that the Doctor was treating a patient who needed urgent medical attention and that he will have to wait till the Doctor finished his treatment.\n\nHe has none of it and tells me he does not have the time to wait. Then he orders me to tell the Doctor that his 3 pm appointment is waiting for him.\n\nI knew the Doctor would drop everything and be running to the Colonel if he got wind of who it was that was waiting for him. He did not have much of a spine, and his career was primarily based on the Colonel’s input and assessment of him.\n\nBut the Colonel had given me an order, and I had to do it. So I went to the treatment room and put my head in. The Doctor was busy stitching up the more injured soldier. And I complied with the Colonel’s order.\n\nMe “Doctor, your 3 pm appointment has arrived.”\n\nThe Doctor, not realizing or remembering who the 3 pm appointment was, told me irritably to have the patient wait till he finished. And that it could be another 5-10 minutes. He repeated what he had told me several times before. To only disturb him for emergencies.\n\nI go back to the Colonel and tell him that the Doctor is still busy treating the patient and would be available in about 10 minutes. The Colonel was not happy and told me to go get the Doctor. NOW!\n\nI told the Colonel I had explicit instructions to only disturb the Doctor in case of an emergency and that his appointment was not an emergency. He would have to wait.\n\nHe grumbled but, in the end, sat down till the Doctor arrived, and he started berating the Doctor about how precious his time was and how he had made him wait. The Doctor apologized and almost groveled as they moved into the Doctor’s office.\n\nI had to go upstairs for something, and the Colonel had already left after I got down. I did get a good ear washing from the Doctor telling me I should have mentioned to him that it was the Colonel who was waiting for him. I argued that it should not matter who was waiting if he was treating a patient who was bleeding all over the place. And that he told me himself that he could only be disturbed for emergencies.\n\nI never got that promotion to corporal or even soldier 1st class. Still worth it.",

My dad then had to go through a whole process to get a corrected birth certificate with his correct gender. \n\n40 years later a city near my dad decided to hold a vote on whether to implement a new law that states something along the lines of, \"You must use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender on your original birth certificate.\" \n\nLoving malicious compliance and being the pro-trans rights person that he is, my dad dug up his original birth certificate again to be prepared to fully abide by the law. \n\nLuckily the law didn't pass but it always makes me laugh thinking about my dad in the women's bathroom with a copy of his original birth certificate to show anyone that complained.",
