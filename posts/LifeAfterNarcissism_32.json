        "text": "I've started to write this post several times and each time I chickened out of posting it because I don't trust my thoughts or feelings anymore. \n\nI broke up with my Nex over a year ago but we continued to share a house until recently. I say \"share\" but it was more like I was an unwelcome guest, or a convenient emotional punching bag or something like that. It took me that long to muster up the fortitude to leave. Now I'm in my own place, and I feel like a wreck. I haven't unpacked my stuff because I have this uneasiness that I'll be forced to go back there. It doesn't feel real that I'm out of that situation. I'm so used to having the rug pulled out from under me that I've come to expect it at every turn. \n\nI'm also struggling with feelings of intense anger. I was never like that before I met him. Now I'm furious, not only at him, but at my Nparents, and at every jerk I've ever met. And at myself for being naive and vulnerable and inviting these people into my life. \n\nI feel like the only way to stop being angry is for my abusers to understand and own up to their behaviour. I also know this is the one thing that's never going to happen. \n\nHow do you forgive people who aren't sorry? I want my life and my old self back. Thank you for listening. ",

        "text": "   I (37m) was in a ten year relationship with with one (39f).   Now I can type a book.  But I will try to keep it brief unless anyone ask for more.   I'm here because I'm reading about this personality type and finding out its almost like a drug.   I need help moving forward. \n \n I always did everything she asked.  But, I was taught that I shouldn't expect a thank you.  If I did, it wasn't about helping for for gratification.  However, I will say she said thank you in her own way many times.   However,  I suffer from depression, with low self esteem.   So, it was nice to just have someone be kind to me.\n  \nWhen we started, she (she was married) would get mad because I felt uncomfortable going   through her stuff to find something.   She would get mad that I didn't want to look. So, I finally broke down and would look for what I needed. Then, once we were an item, she got extremely upset that I touched her stuff and invaded her privacy.  After long thought, the only conclusion is could come to was that in the beginning,  \"I\" was the secret.   Where when we were an item, well...   since i got in trouble for not look for not looking ,  I didn't even know she would get mad.  I was just digging for the movie we were looking for.    She just flipped out.  \n   \nWe sat and talked for hours on end.  In every story, she was the victim.  Now, meeting someone,  all you have is their word.   However as we quickly became best friends,  I vowed to protect her.  \n\n  I will say.  Her power was strong.   Even the smallest argument,  it didn't matter,  I had to apologize.   Then, she would do something amazing,  hook me in deeper.   Please understand,  I do not believe she is a bad person.   And I still love her.  \n \n Even after ten years and getting engaged, me getting divorced and losing everything , which we discussed how we would end things if it ever happened,  we both promised a face to face sit down.    Instead,  she came over,  we made love , I asked her about anything wrong,  which she assured me everything was fine.   All I got that week was a text saying \"I'm blocking you,  never contact me again \"\n    \nAfter reading,  I'm finding out this is a narcissistic form of mental abuse.   Like they have reached all of the self comfort they can out of you,  and this measure is another way to make it about them.\n \n  I can post more if anyone has suggestions or questions.   It's not as simple as just,  forget about her, as I'm reading this love is closers to a drug addiction.    I can't afford therapy,  so, I'm reaching out here.    Thank you. ",

        "text": "TLDR: Any suggestions on how to stay persistent with creating personal boundaries despite backlash from selfish if not N friends?\n\nMy father is a diagnosed N, I have very strong reason to believe my previous ex was one as well (although he's never been diagnosed), and now one of my closest friends who I dated briefly but we broke up and remained close friends is also raising red flags. We grew very close this past year but a large part of that was a dynamic where if he got upset with me he would run away (sometimes literally, including leaving me drunk stranded places) and I would chase him or wait for him to come back, always with forgiveness. During this time my family has gone through some very serious emotional struggles which he also knew about, but despite that he would get mad at me for things that I later realized were incredibly self-centered and unfounded. For example, one time we were at a friends apartment and he literally stopped talking to me for the rest of the evening because I was being too quiet and not \"paying him as much attention as everyone else\" - despite knowing I had dealt with some serious family drama that day so I wasn't quite in the mood to be bubbly with anyone. There are several other instances of him making the friendship all about how he was feeling and either getting upset with me when I did nothing wrong or picking a fight with me for obscure and childish reasons. I remember one time we were in the car talking about how much I had personally achieved this year despite serious emotional set backs. He slowly got more and more upset and later asked me to drop him off. He later admitted that hearing my accomplishments had made him feel bad about his own life and he couldn't deal with it anymore. He knows how much pain I've been through and literally can't be happy with me for fighting through it, it seems. \n\nOver the past few weeks in preparation for the new year, I have realized my own faults in allowing this behavior, and expecting him (and other people in general) to be the source of my self confidence. We talked about this -again full of ME apologizing to HIM - but also making it clear that I won't allow this behavior to continue, and his response was \"well Im going to need a few days to think about this and Ill get back to you about if I want to be friends anymore\". Uhm...what? So you treated me poorly while I chased after you but the minute I start setting healthy boundaries you get chased off?\n\nI guess I first want to know if this behavior really is as bad as I'm coming to realize it. Don't get me wrong, the few times I would get really upset and declare we couldn't be close he would be in tears trying to stay in my life - literally. But the day to day friendship always devolved into arguments about he felt that he wasn't as bad of a person as I claimed and if I was just less hostile during arguments and paid him more attention in general he would be able to be there for me more often. Its this behavior that I received from my previous ex (albeit even MORE extreme) thats making me realize maybe Im dealing with someone who's incredibly selfish and emotionally immature, if not leaning towards being another N.\n\nSecond, any advice on how to make sure I avoid this in the future. Ive identified the fact that I am codependent, done a lot of personal research on how to stop that, and have gotten myself into counseling. I also realized that there were hints/tests in the beginning - i.e. him trying to make me jealous about another girl and then when I called him out on it him devolving into hysterics to where I had to follow/make him feel better as if he's the victim- that could have been a big warning sign if I had realized my issues then. \n\nBut if anyone else has dealt with losing people because they set personal boundaries and ultimately thrived, I could use the encouragement, because I have been \"discarded\" now nearly 3 times in less than a year and while I know Im learning about myself and how to avoid it -and I know Im doing the healthy thing - I'm a little discouraged right now.

Probably the only time I ever spoke to him was at the other uncle's funeral in 1993.   \n\nI'm also not upset no one attempted to notify me. I've been NC since 1994 and they stopped telling me about deaths in the family in 1998. \n\nWhat gave me a chuckle was seeing the obituary. It listed surviving family members to include his \"two nieces\" and even gave their names. The only other uncle on that side of the family died in 2005 and \"three nieces\" were listed in that obit. Since then, I apparently no longer exist!!! hahaha  FINALLY!   \n\nAlthough I do wonder if it's because they accepted I'm not family or if Edad thought I'd see it someday and it assumed would upset me. Either way, it just makes me thankful to be NC and not have to play the mind games with them. ",

I replied only to and about divorce paperwork-related stuff. \n\nWhile we were married, she had an emotional affair with an ex. I was devastated; I loved her very deeply, believing she was \"the one.\" So we got help from a therapist.  A little over a year later... She was up to some of the same lying and boundary breaking behavior with someone else.  I wanted her to be faithful and focus on our relationship. We finally had a fight where I yelled at her and broke some artwork on the wall amd she left because I was being violent. (I regret being that way. It was wrong of me.)\n\nLong story short, I find out she is now with that guy and is posting all over facebook how in love she is, and how much I was unsupportive and emotionally abusive. I know I should not care but damn it hurts a lot. I still think of when I fell in love with her, how sweet she was, how we dreamed. She always told me that guy treated her like shit.  So I'm both sad she went back to a person that mistreated her and feel awful because I feel replaced by the ex she cheated on me with. On top of that I feel terrible about how she is portraying our relationship. Weirdly, she sent me and my kids (previous marriage) a sappy Christmas card. I've told her more than once to stop contacting me. I dont know how to handle all this. I've fallen back into deep depression and some suicidal thoughts. I'm seeing a therapist, but still need help.\n\nI only recently learned all this. I blocked her on social media long ago. A mutual friend finally told me all of it. ",

I never read them until now, and I never would have read them if it weren't for the fact that I need these documents to convince my old university to let me back in without my family's financial help.\n\nIn a letter dated four months after my last contact, my grandma says that my parents had replaced my bedroom with a guest room, complete with a double bed instead of my old twin. Mind you, I was staying in the dorms at this time, which meant that my parents' home was still my permanent residence. Replacing my room with a guest room would have signified that my parents had given up on me and were prepared to condemn me to homelessness (which is in fact what happened, albeit briefly).\n\nWhen I first read this, I cried. I had always pictured my parents leaving my room as it was, maybe storing a few things in it, in case I ever came back. The idea that they had torn down all my things and upgraded my bed after just four months....\n\nBut then I remembered that my parents were still calling, texting, and writing to me at that point and well after telling me that I was always welcome to come home. And my grandma had written several times in the letter that I should not share anything she said on the Internet (Facebook and my blog).\n\nI want to say that she was lying through her teeth, but I could also believe that my parents had in fact changed out my room without telling me while continuing to beg for me to come home. They never respected my property or my privacy, and they gave me the bedroom that was connected to storage so they would always need to have access to it. Leaving it as a shrine may have been too hard for them, or they may just not have cared and decided that they wanted to have it all while I was gone.\n\nIdk. I miss my brother.",

Mom said she wanted to practice the \"I feel...\" statements with me, but kept talking about how hurt she is. The times that I (34/F) tried to \"I feel...\" statements on my Dad he turned on me. \n\n\nI said told Mom something to the effect of: \"Dad doesn't have the emotional intelligence to respond to 'I feel' statements. Tell him he's acting like an a$$hole.\"  (I **rarely** use language like this!)\n\nI sent Mom a video message saying, \"Mom, what if [sister] or I told you that our boyfriend / husband was talking to us the way that Dad is talking to you. What would you tell us? ...It hurts me to see you being treated like a punching bag.\" By the end I was crying.\n\n\nI cut my phone off because I'm too upset to think clearly.

I'm so tired of being asked for \"advice\" when Mom and Dad just keeps doing the same thing that they've done for 40 years.\n\n\nI'm tired of hearing stuff like this because it stirs up decades of bad feelings and helplessness. I'm frustrated because I've had 3 major depressive episodes, 1 hospitalization, and 3 periods I had to take off work. With therapy I feel like I've made amazing progress in my own mind, but phone calls like this make me feel like I've regressed to a misunderstood and deeply depressed teenager.  I keep thinking, 'I'm a 34 year old registered voter, tax payer, and homeowner. I have a retirement account. Why, **WHY** do I stumble backwards with the mere mention of my Dad's behavior?'\n\n\nI lost a very dear friend and coworker on 12/30/16 to complications from a heart attack, pneumonia, and diabetes (the last word from an awful year).  My heart hurts at the loss of such a wonderful, honest, humble, imperfect man. Last night I had a dream that my Dad passed away and I wasn't even sad. When Mom called today the dream came to mind - did something happen to my Dad in real life?  No. But I'm sick and tired of my parents' toxic dynamic.\n",

Mainly because it brings up awful memories of ME as a child helpless and in emotional or physical pain and fear, crying. That sound just brings back those feelings. Mostly I never wanted children because I'm afraid I'll turn into my mother. As much as I hate to admit it, I see myself in her in many ways. I'm very self-centered and think of myself A LOT. I tend to play the victim especially when someone gets upset with me for legitimate reasons. Drives my fiancé crazy the whole \"woe is me I'm the worst everyone hates me\" thing, and then switching to \"well what about ME?\" And I get that from my mother. I am not cruel and hurtful and malicious like she is, but the main motivations behind her behaviors Drive mine as well. Even though I never WANTED children, I felt robbed of the choice. I knew on a rational level that I could NEVER rise above my abuse, and to put my children through that same hell would be selfish... so even though I didn't want children, if I did, I never really could have them. I felt like I was coping with emotional infertility, some kind of lack of maternal instinct that I was doomed to never have. But it didn't matter really, I didn't want kids and neither did my fiancé.\n\nI had always entertained the idea of \"if we change our minds someday, we can adopt older children,\" because it is nice to fantasize about the kodak moments. The Christmas mornings, the family portraits, the birthday parties. But I knew in the back of my head my fiancé would never change his mind, and I would never be a good mother anyway. Besides, those are just fantasies. Like moving to a tropical island. Sure the idea of it is nice, until you take into consideration the constant rain and sand. It's still nice to daydream about though.\n\nSomething changed in me then, I'm not sure what, but when I used to see babies I would think \"oh ew,\" and now for the past few months i want to cuddle and hold them. This got me entertaining the idea, and brought it up to my fiancé, and we had a real talk about it beyond \"Fuck that they're expensive and too much work.\" He'd been having similar thoughts lately, not so much about taking care of a baby but raising a person to be a better person than him. We hashed it out and he helped me get to the bottom of my fears and we kind of want to start a family someday. \n\nAnd now that it's a real possibility to think about, I'm realizing that it's not that I *didnt want* kids, because I really desperately do... I was just fucking scared. But now I'm entertaining all of my \"hypothetically if I had kids how would I handle this situation\" fantasies. I'm looking back on my own childhood not as a scared wounded child but a grown adult woman, and I'm just wondering how could my mother do that??? I don't even have children of my own, but shit if I did I cannot imagine putting them down and actively insulting them because of my own insecurities. And I'm insecure as hell. I can't imagine doing that to ANY child or person let alone my own flesh and blood. Now that I'm entertaining my fantasies of motherhood, I'm realizing a mom is there to protect you and love you and care for you and make your fears and insecurities go away. If I had a kid from the day they're born until they are all grown if I made them feel bad about themselves unintentionally that would break my heart I cannot fathom doing that on purpose to your own child. There is something not right with my mother, with all of our mothers, that they are lacking that instinct to care for and protect their children and instead hurt them and break them. ",

Its too difficult to work out who I am, I want to die, I want to end this and float in beautiful calm empty darkness. ",

They have kept in contact with me, gently and kindly, mostly remotely, while I figure out how to have a relationship with them in this new normal. I don't want to risk contact with my Nfamily, and I don't want to overcomplicate the lives of everyone else. I don't want them to think I want them choose with whom to be in contact. I am not going to stoop to NMom's level - I have heard through the grapevine that she is telling everyone she can about how much I have abused HER and how I must have a personality disorder (she has no grounds to claim this, though as a Psychotherapist, she would say she does). When I talk with my relatives, we only talk about each other - not Nmom.\n\nFlash forward to Christmas Eve. My aunt and uncle invite us to their place, along with my grandmother and some cousins. We have a perfectly lovely time. We did not talk about my nuclear family at all. I thanked them so much for thinking of us and welcoming us. Pictures of us having fun together probably went up on Facebook. I heard through the grapevine yesterday that my Nmom &amp; Co. have now blocked all of those people too. EDad hung up when grandmother called to wish him Merry Christmas. I feel really bad for my relatives that Nmom and EDad  are being so petty to them, though I think I can accept that this is not my fault. We are trying to live our lives as happily as we can with people we care about. Maybe this will just show my relatives that they may not want contact with my nuclear family either, given their behavior.",

        "text": "   My mother was in a relationship with her Nboyfriend for about 15 years. Unfortunately he lived with us from the time I was about 8 or 9 years old till about 20 years old, when I moved out. During that time period I witnessed him emotionally and mentally abuse my mother (and although I never saw it, friends of my Mom also said he was physically abusive as well) with constant gaslighting, baiting, silent treatment, love bombing, invalidation...the works. I never entertained his games, so it wasn't long before he hated me. He would convince my mother I was nothing but a slacker and a liar, but I digress.                                \n   The point of my post is: They are now broken up, my mother has been in a new relationship for a few months but the Nboyfriend WON'T leave her alone. He emails her, calls her cellphone, calls her work phone and has other people contact her for him since she has been trying to go NC. In one instance he said he needed to pick some items up from her house then never showed up for weeks (still hasn't, but the things are gone), it was just another mind game. The problem is, we cannot block him through our work phone, the system just won't allow it and changing the number is out of the question. The company has had the same number for forty years and it would be a mess if we try to change it now. He is walking the line of harassment and just being a pest (which I'm sure he is aware of), so there really isn't anything legally we can do. She is trying her hardest to go NC but when he calls our work, she picks up, not knowing it's him, it really bothers her no matter how quick she hangs up.                                                                                   \n    What can she do?

        "text": "Note: I posted this on another subreddit before but didn't get any responses, so I decided to re-post here. I really need support right now and I'm going through a really hard time, especially through the holidays. Thanks!\n\nHi all, I'm 19 and I live with my mother right now...I don't know how to begin this..hm.\nMy mother was always very supportive of me growing up and would never directly insult me or physically abuse me, however, she always had a big martyr and victim complex, a fiery temper, and refused to ever be wrong. I noticed how she would drop close friends of hers and mine that she'd known for years if they said something that she perceived even as slightly criticial of her or her parenting. Or whenever she talks about things that happened between her and her friends like arguments she'll always play the victim and she's a very negative person constantly talking poorly of other people or trashing other families and saying how healthy and great we are. I don't have that good of a memory but I do remember a lot of times if we got into an argument when I was a child, she woud always be screaming to the point I would run to my room in tears and she'd try to bang the door down. As I got older and realized the way to talk to someone about how you feel is not to scream at them, whenever we would get into arguments I'd always try to rationally talk to her but she always ends up twisting whatever I say or playing the victim, or screaming at me until I'm in tears and running to my room, or leaving the house for days on end because it got so bad. (similairly to when I was a child but with a different dynamic I guess) And she never apologizes. Or if she does, it's a faux apology like, \"I did this/I blew up, but your communication was bad and you said something that hurt me and you triggered me\" etc.\n\nLately, I've gotten into this habit of pretending she didn't do anything wrong/accepting the faux apologies because I'm highly conflicted because I love my mother and she's the only family I have and I don't have many friends here, so when she gets this way I freak out and become extremely depressed...even though I know for my own health it would be better not to be around her it's so hard for me. Typically, the way this starts is either I say something she perceives as rude that could be as innocent as nothing, or I do say something that is rude from resentment I have built up from never telling her how I feel due to the way she acts, she gets overly defensive and twists it on me/blows up and then a few days later she comes back acting nice and apologetic...yet never taking the blame??? Like she'd say \"oh I don't want to fight anymore you're my daughter I don't have to be right.\" But yet she'll never actually apologize and if I try to search for an apology she will blow up and commonly say \"You're squeezing blood out of a turnip! I try my best/You want me to be the whipping boy!\" So I end up buying into her fake apology and going on normally (as it seems) yet having a lot of anger and resentment sometimes to the point I feel furious around her on random days and everything she does irritates me and I won't even know why. And then I sometimes end up exploding from it which then starts the vicious cycle.\n\nThe most recent incident was Christmas eve. We were in the car and talking about how we don't have much family and I said something along the lines of \"I know you only had me, but that's ok.\" (I'm an only child) And I do acknowledge it probably wasn't the nicest thing to say and it was probably laced with resentment from the bottled up feelings, but then she started to guilt trip me about how she had a hysterectomy and wanted more children and went into this whole ordeal and she'd say she wouldn't want to talk about it, yet go on and on...finally she started screaming at me, I got out of the car, then later we went home, I locked myself in my room because we live in a very small apartment with no privacy, she screamed at me again with her boyfriend downstairs hearing the entire thing telling me I have family and I'm ungrateful for not spending time with them even though I was very upset and almost suicidal at that point. All the while I was trying to talk to my now ex boyfriend (who I suspect might be a narcissist as well) and ask if I could spend christmas with his family and he pretty much said \"sorry you're on your own you need to deal with this yourself\" and left me for a day. So I was feeling pretty miserable..\n\nFast forward a week, I go to the city awhile and spend some time with my friend and his family for christmas to get away from everything and come back a week later and try to make conversation with her and her tone was really sour and she said things like \"Well I gave you your space because YOU were so angry with me and YOU didn't want to talk to me\" And then said something about how she cried 250 tears and prayed for me to find my way. I thought maybe after all that time apart she would take time to think about her actions and the way she treated me that day, and apologize yet it felt like she was still not getting it and playing the victim even after all that..What makes me angry is how she never takes responsibility. She's always pointing the finger at me even when she's caused me enough pain to not spend the holidays with her she still never looks at herself and plays the victim even if she knows that with never changing that behavior she will eventually lose me. And for someone who supposedly cares so much about her daughter i don't get why she acts this way. And then later that day when I told her I wouldn't speak to her unless she could rationally talk to me and take her part she said \"I blew up but you triggered me and it was a hard day because my father died and your communication was bad and you seemed angry and I saw your facebook posts and I know how YOU feel\" I feel like she always uses my anger against me even though it's somewhat rightful as this has been happening for years and never improving and she's constantly invalidating my feelings or trying to make me feel sorry for her.. Sorry for this long mess of a post but I'm depressed, angry, and confused and I don't know what to make of this or what it is or how to deal with it or recover from it. I'm trying to move out right now but it may be awhile until I can...I get really scared and upset and I don't know what to do. Help? I try to talk to my friends about it but I feel like they don't always understand and many times when it happens I've recorded her because I feel like no one ever believes me..",

        "text": "New to this sub, though I don't know why I didn't look it up before. The Reader's Digest version is that I am recovering from narcissistic abuse by my now-ex-husband and his mother, whose relationship I've heard described as emotionally incestuous. I was married for 21 years, have been separated now for 18 months and divorced for a year. During our marriage, my ex kept his mother as the #1 person in his life, above me and the kids, let her rule the roost even though she didn't live with us, unless I started yelling to be heard. He started cheating on me (that I know of) when we hadn't even been married for a year - in his mom's house, with her help, left and begged me to take him back after 6 months, which I now realize was really dumb to do. I had other suspicions of cheating, but nothing to base them off of until I finally left. During  our marriage, they were both emotionally abusive and verbally abusive to both me and our kids. I left after I realized I couldn't fix it. The day after I told him I was completely done (two weeks after I told him I wanted a divorce and he begged me to try and work it out), he told me he was \"in love\" with a woman he'd been talking to online for 15 years. He moved in with her two weeks after our divorce was final.\n\nSince then, I have met and now moved in with a wonderful man who is everything my ex was not - kind, caring, loving, tender - I realize that people will tell me it was too soon, but I didn't plan it and he came from an abusive relationship where his ex abused him, so he understands where I'm coming from most of the time.\n\nThe problem is that, even though I trust him, I get anxious that he will leave me for someone better. I'm in recovery for codependency, which has helped, but I still can't help but overthink and try to see more deeply into what he says instead of accepting it at face value. I know I have abandonment anxiety and that was triggered big time on New Year's Eve when we got into an argument and he told me I should go stay with my daughter for the night (she's 23). \n\nAny advice for coping with this would be appreciated.\n\nUPDATE: I talked to him last night and told him how much it hurt to hear him tell me he wanted me to leave and that it felt like he was abandoning me. He told me he was sorry and that it was a knee-jerk reaction and that my actions during our argument were a trigger for him (he was abused by his ex-wife, which is why he understands my triggers, usually.)",

Not necessarily because he is so bad, but because of the way he makes me feel, when I stay in my own mind and body long enough to notice it.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nAnd it is bad.  \nI honestly thought before that I don‘t have flashbacks around him, but I recently realized that they are just so ubiquitous that I dissociate practically immediately when I come into his presence, and thus feel „fine“, but underneath I am actually scared, angry and repulsed a lot of the time.  \n  \nIt‘s not even anything big or obvious, just the little things, or my perception of them.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nIt‘s the way he praises his own cooking without prompting, in a way that we all have to agree with him. Several times throughout the meal, until he seems satisfied with the showed enthusiasm. I don‘t dare think about what would happen if someone was to complain.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nIt‘s the way he asks about my boyfriend of 2 years - „So, are you still together with this [boyfriend‘s occupation] guy?“.  \nHe is not interested enough to remember (or use) my boyfriend‘s first name, or ask how it is going, or if I‘m happy. Just if we‘re still together, probably expecting me to say no one day, just so he can show „sympathy“, mixed with an „I told you so, didn‘t I?“, and that‘s all that matters.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n  \nIt‘s the way he „jokes“ about how if I fail out of University, I can work at his small law firm (which I have absolutely no training for or interest in).  \nMixed in with thinly veiled comments about how he can understand people who spend years trying to find someone to keep up their legacy, and the fact that my brother and I will inherit this fucking firm (which my father hasn‘t actually told me about, my brother did), I get the feeling he really, really wants me (or us) to work there, and possibly keep it up after his retirement. It was the actual stuff of a nightmare I had later that night.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nIt‘s the way he intently tells me out of the blue that if I have any type of trouble, I can come to him and ask for help. It‘s giving me this really weird vibe that he would just LOVE it if I got in really deep shit, so he can show his awesomeness by helping me, having me grateful to him eternally and, possibly, start working in his firm „to get back on my feet“.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nAnd, most of all, it‘s the way he invades my space.  \nDuring the evening I was actually at some point sitting with my legs up on the couch and my arms crossed, because he had his feet where mine were supposed to be and his arm draped towards me, possibly ready to snatch my hand, because he really likes to hold hands when he is a bit drunk. I stopped him from doing that quite some time ago by the genius strike of keeping my hands where he can‘t reach them, but I still shudder with the memory of him „tenderly“ stroking my hands during these occasions in the past. It feels like a demonstration of ownership - „I can do that because you let me, and you let me because you love me, right?“.   \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nI feel like it‘s hard to convey what is so bad about it, why that shit scares and nauseates me so much. I don‘t really understand all of it either.  \n  \nAlso, I know that it is entirely possible that I‘m reading too much into his behaviour, or rather that I confuse past with present, as emotional flashbacks tend to go.  \nBut I also know that if I do, it‘s part of my C-PTSD, and that the person responsible for me having that disorder is, chiefly among others, Ndad, so it‘s not really hitting the wrong guy here.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n  \nAnyway, I just needed to vent. Thanks for reading, and a happy New (and hopefully N-free) year!",

        "text": "Trust is nearly impossible for me. The analogy I gave my therapist is that I'm an AM antenna in a FM world - the trust signals are there but I don't have the equipment to pick them up. No matter how hard I try I just can't find a way to trust my therapist even a wee little bit. It's not him - it's 110% me. After being raised with all the lovely issues coming out of narcissistic (and BPD) abuse, those painful family dynamics just won't leave me alone. Every time I start to think it's safe to be in a small room with my therapist, I freak out (the transference is chaos). Just earlier this week, I got dysregulated in session, he had to stop and calm me down, which freaked me out MORE, and I ended up putting my fingernails through my hand and had to stop session to ice my injuries. By his helping me, I felt on one hand pushed by him - *okay, start feeling better now* - and on the other hand I started to relax infinitesimally as he was soothing me and tensed up almost immediately - *dangerous, run!* Between that and the nausea I was feeling, it's clear though I was not conscious of emotions, they expressed somatically.\n\nIt's a special kind of torture to walk in wanting to feel, feeling too unsafe to be with him, and then not accessing those feelings in the one place I *should* feel safe enough to do so. For that's still a massive issue - I don't feel safe enough to feel scared. It unnerves me greatly for anyone to soothe or comfort me, much less offer safety, and I'm not sure why. \n\nMy therapist is always very quiet, very validating, very gentle, very calm and very, very nonjudgmental. I find myself figuratively huddled in front of him, unable to move and barely able to breathe, though to all appearances I'm sitting upright, well-oriented and participating in the conversation. I find myself feeling frantically clingy, as though I want to not let him or I leave. Sometimes, I have the overwhelming feeling that I just want him to hug me. But imaging that scenario leads to hyperventilation. I never, ever feel like this at any other time. But there is more. It's the horrible vulnerability when I have to look away from someone, or that moment of panic when my eyes close during a sneeze. It's feeling bad, marked, a target, something everyone else can see that says I'm available to go after and always will be. It's being told repeatedly that there are nice people out there, but instead of seeing them, the ghosts of the past possess them. I tell myself it's better to be alone, which is fine until I get overwhelmed by loneliness.\n\nThe feeling is so intense and out of proportion to the experience I can almost guarantee it's a memory, not the truth; something put away in another time because it was too much to experience then. I just don’t know what it is that I'm avoiding so hard. It's just nameless horror. I don’t even know what is normal behavior anymore, as opposed to some narcissistic nutjob concept I grew up with. \n\nPart of me feels so humiliated and ashamed. To be an adult, grown woman with responsibilities, that hasn't gotten over her past is embarrassing. Somehow, I've internalized the damage inflicted on me, and fundamentally believe that damage is a reflection of my worth and capabilities. I see the logical flaw, but that doesn't change the feelings. \n\nI'm scared and I don't want to trust my therapist because I don't want to be disappointed by him. No . . . not really true. I already hope he won't disappoint me or I wouldn't have gotten this far. So what I'm really scared of is facing all of these feelings, alone. I'm afraid of feeling suicidal and afraid of feeling pain, despair and chaos. I'm afraid to accept I was abused (I have to work at even typing the word!) and bad things happened. Maybe I'm afraid to believe in my worth, and afraid that in the end, there is nothing wrong with me but me. I'm freaked out because I'm experiencing this sense of incongruency. And I fear I want to talk about it so I'm not alone with that, so I feel manipulative.\n\nAnd I know to get through it, I'm going to have to experience it in my therapist's office, but the thought of doing so, being vulnerable, makes me queasy. Then when I get home, I feel driven to write to capture how I feel. Right now we're still building trust (after over a year!), and essentially I'm telling stories to entertain us while we wait. I'm trying so hard not to run. That way I get enough distance and stability to manage things, especially as shame and self-loathing are so strong; needing harsh rationality to keep them from overwhelming me. And it's so exhausting to try to overpower my instinct with my reason. \n\nOur attunement is awesome, but this transactional wariness is making me crazy. I need to be able to feel if I (for example) lean down to tie my shoes I'm not going to be in danger. \n\nI mostly just need to vent, but if anyone has any insight or experience with learning to trust (especially in therapy), it is welcome.

        "text": "My mother is now 86 yrs old with Alzheimer's. We have been NC for over two years and I didn't realize it but she was trying to have NC with me for a few years before that. We had low contact for most of my adult life. I have an older sister who is the golden child and I was nothing. Basic background, growing up my mother was very self absorbed, only my very basic needs were met, I was basically ignored, isolated and criticized. Since I was 4 years old knew something was seriously wrong with my mother and by 7 yrs old wished she were dead, but not because I hated her, I just felt my life would be better without her even if more difficult. \n\nOddly, my mother named me as power of attorney for her, when early signs of Alzheimers showed I took some action because her brother suddenly became interested in her finances too much. He would tell her creepy things like he wished he could marry her, told her what she wanted to hear about a lot of things which she could no longer do like drive and live by herself. He took her to an attorney to remove my POA without telling me.\n\nEven though I did not like her I spent several thousand dollars with an attorney trying to legally stop the brother because it was in her best interest, it worked but I actually lost the case and had to settle with putting my sister and a fiduciary in charge. Over time I see that this is the best thing as I have no legal ties to my mother.\n\nMy sister is in charge of her health care. A while back my mother had arranged to give me electronic access to her health care records. Sister is not good with internet or anything computer related. I noticed my sister was not sending my mother to get some lab work done, reminded her twice, then the doctor did after 4 months pass. They showed moderate kidney damage. Nmom was referred to a kidney doctor. He ordered lab tests for a year from now. Having some training in the medical field I felt this was crazy and strongly urged sister to get these tests done quicker, not in 12 months but have a 3 month follow up. Sister had labs done and showed a steep decline in kidney damage. Doctors took action and now things are stable. If she had waited a year, she'd probably need dialysis. It was so tough doing the right thing, still have conflict.",

The people who done customer service for their first time in their lives may know what I mean.  It doesn't come naturally. \n\nI'd rather cry in my bed.

I am *that* person, I can get waved by a tsunami and still attempt to stand there, with blood and water on my shirt, and say, \"hey, I'm okay.\"\n\nSorry if this makes you feel graphical, a bit. :P\n\nAnd somehow, I helped my co-worker.

        "text": "Hello,\n\neverything tells me that she is a narcissist. I have got a crush for her around August / September this year and I have single handedly turned her down because I was super tired of all gaslighting and her unapproachability. I was always thinking that we are \"almost there\" to get closer to her but that has never happened so I said to myself, screw it, and after giving her the last dose of NS, I just cut her off. It was hard for me to do because I have invested in this emotionally and I have not known that these people actually do exist in real life.\n\nInitially, she told me (wrote me) that she is sorry how it ended up but I said that it is more or less her fault and I have enough dignity to cut contact with somebody when he or she is so unresponsive and hard to read and that if she ever wanted to get back again, she is welcome but it must be her own effort - not solely mine - and that I was always honest with her.\n\nI blocked her on FB, no contact for 2 and half months, I have been thinking a lot about breaking no contact but I just could not do that because it would just show I can not keep my promise. So I shut up and was quiet.\n\nNow the mistake I did was that I had unblocked her just to see how she is going after these almost three months, and to my very big surprise, she wrote me first after few days. (how did she know I have unblocked her? did she kind of stalk me or what all that time in between?)\n\nShe told me that she is sorry for what happened and that it is a pity we split and if it is possible to meet.\n\nYou can imagine I was very glad she did this, of course I was happy, who would not be, and I told her that yes, we can meet and I am sorry too. I asked her if it is possible to meet so and so and she did not respond initially, saying she was abroad and did not have the internet in the mobile phone (complete bullshit) and she is going abroad again tomorrow (complete bullshit #2) and we could meet on Wednesday. I said fine. 2 red flags up to now.\n\nNow there is the Wednesday and no contact from her. Red flag #3. This was very suspicious to me, I had this strange feeling the long time before but I was thinking I am just paranoid or something and I wrote her that it is stupid to expect me to set up a meeting when she was the one who initiated it and I consider this behavior towards me as disrespectful and I will not tolerate that.\n\nShe answered IMMEDIATELY that she is very busy (bullshit #4) and we could meet from now (2pm) till 6pm. WTF man ... I said I am at work and I am free from 7, she said she is not free in the evening anymore and we can meet tomorrow in the afternoon for one hour from 15:30 to 16:30. What a complete crap :D Now red flags were all around ...\n\nNow we are getting to the point. I was so angry that I said her, literally, that I am very sorry for her and that she is mentally ill and she is a complete fake to me and I am done with her again for at least two months I did block her and we are in a no-contact again.\n\nNow the question is, I realized that she is super narcissist after this, all this stuff is so obvious and transparent to me now that I am ashamed I have been fooled for so long, but looking at this now, I am also kind of proud to myself that I have been able to see through this so relatively quickly, that I have stood my ground and I refused to be involved in this anymore.\n\nFor somebody not being involved with a narcissist up to now, not a bad job at all.\n\nI read a ton of stuff about this and I realized that the only right way how to do this is not to contact her again because in her eyes she would get attention again and I would lost, more to it, she will definitely ignore me after I get in touch, because ... because it is a narcissist :D And because by ignoring her, I have caused here a narcissistic injury. The motivation of vengeance is very strong in these people and I can imagine that she is totally insane now because I just completely destroyed her, by letting her know that I know that she is playing that and that I know she is mentally ill, from her perspective, I have just uncovered her. And from what I know, Ns absolutely and completely hate to be disclosed.\n\nNow the only perfect response from me is not to get in touch with her after two months again and not to get in touch any more at all, because I can pretty much imagine she is \"waiting\" for these two months to pass and after I get in touch, she would totally discard me to prove her upper hand.\n\nNow it seems that I am the one who has a control here as I specified when she will be contacted again but the perfect vengeance would be not to contact her again - that would just torn her apart (even more she currently is).\n\nIs this good thing to do?",

        "text": "My undiagnosed covert narcissist ex has been mimicking me for the past few years.  At first, while we were still together, he would start listening to the music I listened to (which was/is highly eclectic and there's no way he just \"started liking the same stuff\"), and things I'd say.  Nicknames I gave our child suddenly became HIS nicknames for her too, only he would act like he made them up, same with phrases I’d use and opinions I had - he regurgitated ALL of this as if it were born from his own thoughts.  He rarely made his own friends, but tried so very hard to make all of my friends be HIS friends too (if he couldn’t convince me that they sucked and I didn’t like them after all).  This was so strange because for most of our ridiculously up and down relationship he belittled everything I did and said and wore and ate and whatever else...  But then when it was clear we were headed for a breakup he began not wooing ME, but trying to take my place, trying to erase me and be me.  It really freaked me out and nailed that divorce coffin shut that much faster...  \nAnyway, we've been separated like a year and a half now and have gotten divorced.  He's done a lot of stupid things during this time that showcase his N traits to me, but this one is just really still freaking me out more than the rest.  He's literally \"wooing\" the people that he thinks I would want to be around and doing this by what he thinks is behaving like me, in addition to the typical N tricks of just...  pretending he likes what THEY like.  He's using phrases that I used and pretending to have a personality like mine on social media.  He's going to shows for music that I've been into for years, but that he never cared knew anything about.  He's publicly begging people to hang out with him, and especially with these shows, he's putting it out there on social media \"who wants to go see xyz this week?\"  I don't own people and I would never blame anyone for being around him, but it makes me feel sick that I know his manipulations are working on a LOT of people, MOST people, in fact.  I see right through it (after YEARS of believing he could change and giving him countless chances to, I know now he never can), especially because of how blatantly he's been copying me, but others don't.  I don't want to run in to him and I really just want him out of my life with the exception of co-parenting (which is REALLY hard with a CN, btw!).  On top of that he's launched a smear campaign - according to him I'm an alcoholic and I just \"run around and party\" all the time.  I don't want to avoid all these friends because they didn't do anything wrong, but the idea of seeing him at events all the time if I don't just makes me feel sick inside.  Also it makes me super insecure wondering what they're thinking if I have a glass of wine while around them or worse, actually get drunk.  IDK if I'm asking for advice or just needing to get this out there in a group that might understand.  I think the latter.  Thanks for reading if you made it this far! Nappy New Year!!  :)",

Me and him have a one year old together and I'm 6 months pregnant. \nI'm considering pursuing taking action for child support. Considering... as I know doing this only gives him rights to our child and I don't think I want that.\nAnyways that's not what the post is about. \nSo I'm talking to the legal aid officer the other week, explaining that this guy is in another country, I don't know his address, or even what city he is in. She said a few suggestions, asking friends or family, which I won't because I know it will get back to him. \n\nNote, I've been no contact for months now)\nSo after 3 weeks of contemplating how on earth I will ever get any information on this guy, I decided hey, why not see if his password to his email is the same as when he was here with me. \nBingo it was. And I will say now that I did get his address as he ordered Domino's and a phone to be delivered to the same address in his name. \nAnyway, I also seen an email from a message his new supply sent (who is also 6 months pregnant to him) \nYes I read it. \nShe was angry at him, because he got drunk Christmas Eve and \"repeatedly said 'fuck your dead son!'\" to her.\nShe had a still Born a few years ago sometime in December. \n\nAnd while it does give me satisfaction that I know he is incapable of changing and he's still the holiday ruining ass hole he's always been.... FUCK I wish I could message her and tell her to run! \nThe message prior to that also said \"I know you were just drunk babe. After everything I still love you unconditionally. Me and baby can't wait to see you. We'll all be together again.\" \n\nLike wtf. I know she knows he's abusive and a narcissistic, and I know it's not my place, I wouldn't ever message her, there would be no point. \nAnd no I shouldn't have snooped in his email. I know I'll get scolded for this. But still. \nThis girl has been really awful to me, see previous posts about her. But damn I feel bad for her. \nI wish she would leave.\n\nAlso note that last year he ruined my Christmas and New Years and everything in between so, he hasn't changed and I know he actually can't change either. He is who he is. \n\nBut still. ",

        "text": "I haven't posted in here for a while, so quick recap: 30yo ACoNMom and Estepdad, happily married with young son (LO) and great career, attempted LC. \n\nNine times out of ten NMom behaves herself so we see each other for holidays and occasional lunches, but man, when that tenth time strikes, it is brutal.\n\nNMom wanted to friend me on Facebook so she \"wouldn't miss any photos of LO\". I put this off for a while and put all my old posts on lockdown, but finally I gave in. I post a ton, mostly inane shit, and couldn't think of any time in the past three years or so I had even written about my mother, so foolishly I assumed she would behave herself and not dig looking for postings about her. Mistake!! Of course she scoured my ten+ year old wall and found some unpleasant things I had written about her in the hundreds of thousands of words I have ever posted. (It would almost be flattering.) \n\nI was dreading Christmas for all the usual reasons and also because I was sure that she would pounce on me for something from Facebook. Opportunities for her to do so came and went and I started to let my guard down. Of course she waited until my husband went to work before cornering me in the kitchen. \n\nShe told me how cruel and mean I was to her. How I pretended to be a badass who hates her mother but really I love her and can't let anyone know that. Angrily I explained that since I was a child I had to break myself into who I really was and the version of myself that was acceptable to her, and that is who she's dealt with all these years. That's who still calls her Mom and tells her I love her.\n\nShe then had the fucking AUDACITY to claim that *I* had memory issues and remembered things incorrectly. At that I laughed out loud and told her that for YEARS I had questioned the very nature of my reality because of HER mechanism of changing the facts to suit her purpose. It wasn't until I was several years in college and recalling events with college and high school friends that I realized I have a perfectly fine memory, better than most in fact. \n\n(I didn't know it at the time, but the night before this exchange my husband and NMom were talking and she was saying how she paid for my undergraduate education. Husband reminded her that my biological father paid for half of it and when he lost his job, I stepped up and paid several thousand dollars towards my tuition - a cup in the bucket, but a lot of money for someone working $12/hour. NMom denied it and said that my stepdad had paid that money. Husband didn't say anything because he knows how NMom is, but he was sorely tempted to remind her that he and I were dating at the time and he remembered my payment crystal clearly!)\n\nNMom said that she wasn't a bad person and she did her best and that she just has a bad sense of humor and didn't know how sensitive I was. I tried to show her how that was just shifting the blame onto me. She insinuated that all I did was just trying to piss her off, and I reminded her that it was MY choice to see her for the holiday and MY choice to allow her to see my son whenever she wanted. Finally she said that she'd be willing to go to counseling if that's what I really wanted, but she didn't think it would do anything. I told her I'd ask my psychologist if she would meet with us (this is the psych who made me realize she was an NMom years ago) and started packing.\n\nThen LO sprayed himself in the eye with Tilex that NMom had left unsecured under the sink and we had to go to the ER (he's fine)...sigh.\n\nSo now it's time to stop playing nice. NMom is confused because I'm kind to her because that was the only way to survive my first eighteen years? Fine, she can see the reality of me looking forward to whenever she kicks the bucket. \n",

        "text": "My ex, who I suspect to be a narcissist, and I broke up about 4 months ago, and I've been NC for 110 (?) days now. About 2 weeks after I broke things off, he got a new \"girlfriend\" (I use the term loosely). This was a deeply painful realization.\n\nOne of the last things he said to me before I cut all ties (our last conversation was a doozy, wherein he erroneously accused me of cheating, and I flew off the rails) was, \"You're really hurting our chances to get back together later.\" Like, okay, 1) why would you enter a new relationship if there are chances of us getting back together later?; and 2) if I supposedly cheated on you, why would you want me back anyway (his response: \"I care about you, I just don't trust you.\")? \n\nIt isn't something I obsess over or think about most of the time, but on really low days where I get triggered by something (visiting family and feeling isolated), it haunts me a bit. A person can't change in 2 weeks, and they can't change in 3-4 months unless it's a change they actively want and work for (and even then, that's a pretty short timeline). \n\nGiven that, why do I want to think he's a different person? Why do I somehow think that she won't be subjected to the same treatment I was? How do I stop believing that he magically morphed into a non-abusive saint?",

This is a cycle that has gone on for years. I was never treated more than a live in slave. Caring for the dogs and doing house chores. It was a hell I have not forgotten. It still brings on a deep hatred for any pet or dog my parents have. It created such a deep loathing in me that I actually dislike dogs now. The only ally in my house was a cat, and to this day I will never have such a kind soul of a cat. I'll never understand how he liked me so much when I was in such a hell of a place. I lost my temper more than i care to admit. (Nothing violent just sometimes he didn't deserve the misplaced anger I had)\n\nI didn't realize how much I was holding on to my hopes we would be a family. A proper one. Until I heard that. It's was a passing fact, yet it devastated me on such a deep level I realized my answer is i will never be able to have them in my life. I thought -- some part of me, bigger than I realized -- that my parents would feel the pain of not having their daughter and reach out. They know my address. I changed my email and my phone number but they have my address. I should have known it will never get better. I just need to move on and take care of my own family. My husband and my three cats. Maybe a child if i can heal. \n\nMy question: does anyone's nparents replace them with pets or animals? Is this common?\n\nTl;dr: found out nparents got new dog. Sent into spiral of flash backs and personal hell of years ago. Wondering if anyone else has had this experience.",

As we grew up and I introduced him to people (he never had any friends) he started bonding with another RBN friend and they started getting cocky and really unpleasant, so I went NC for a couple of years, every time I reconnected with that group I would feel uncomfortable, they are all RBN for a couple of exceptions, so I also felt like I belonged. It wasn't until this summer I got close to them again, they are all in college right now and I felt they were really changed, nice people, so I started hanging out with them a lot. It spiraled quickly into conversations of purely criticizing others by shallow details. This one particular friend though, I realize now, has blown into a full Narcissist, and had been feeding on me this whole time while giving me more FLEAS I thought I got rid off in the past,I tried going NC again but yesterday he saw me and started talking to me and I am so angry I didn't got the fuck away from there, there's this strange comfort that I get from Narcs because that's what I'm used to, and making new friends is so hard because I don't know how to interact with healthy people, I'm always so afraid I will bore them or scare them by being awkward. Thank you if you read this and do you guys have the same issues? How do you cope with that?

        "text": "Four days from now, it'll be a year ago since I discovered RBN and LAN. Exactly a year ago, I was on a christmas holiday with my spouse and my parents which in and of itself was a big step towards realising that I'm an ACON.\n\nToday, a few hours ago, a friendly gynecologist looked me warmly in the eyes and asked me if anyone had ever told me that I show strong signs of having PTSD. When I said that no one ever had, but that I'd thought it myself, he said \"of course, because you're a clever woman\" and gave me the number of a trauma psychologist who he personally recommends. \n\nThat session ended with two hugs and me balling my eyes out in the waiting room toilet. And me aimlessly wandering around trying to find my way home afterwards, feeling both relieved and overwhelmed. Like I've just been SEEN, and FOUND, and also so, so frustrated that I've not been before.\n\nAnd you guys, I want to channel this to tell you all something:\n\n- I am so effing proud of you. Every single last one of you who has endured and realised and is trying to cope. I am so rooting for you; you're learning, you're trying to heal, you ARE coping. \n\n- Don't berate yourself when something suddenly hits you. Don't get angry with yourself for having setbacks, stalls, relapses or whatever else you would call them. Someone tampered with your wiring from you were so, so small, and you're trying to fix it the best you can, in your own pace. If you are berating yourself, let me say this: I am so proud of you for every single little success you have created for yourself while coping.\n\n- It will hit you. It will hit you like a boulder or a small bullet. Like a pin prick or a fucking wall falling on top of you. It'll hit you when you find christmas ornaments in the bottom of a box that you only JUST now realise why you hate. It'll hit you when you're grocery shopping and someone asks for a lark if you should buy this cheap ass candy that they love, and your face goes ashen because you remember something from when you were 5 that you never even thought to think could be an issue. It will hit you when you're relaxing by the pool on that holiday that your partner or your friend has convinced you to go on, and you're finally letting go and relaxing; and suddenly you tense right back up because you realise that you've not learned how to relax and it's scary. Breathe, baby. I am so proud of you for unpacking the ornaments (and maybe even throwing those ones out), for even going grocery shopping and for allowing yourself a holiday. You'll get there. You'll decorate your home like you want (you'll learn how you want to decorate). You'll eat whatever you want (you'll learn what you like to eat). You'll learn to relax (you'll learn whether you even like pool side holidays too). \n\n- Being struck does not mean being struck down. Allow yourself the feelings. Keep writing LAN/RBN/AI or whichever forum you use. Keep talking to that psychologist. Write a friend on your way home from work and ask him to come by to do nothing and order pizza while watching Say Yes To The Dress just to wriggle your nose at see through bodices and get through that panic attack - because it is temporary, and you're learning. You're learning, and you're not being struck down. And I am so proud of you.\n\n- And as a special shout out to all the people who either do or do not know how come they're going all unstable and frustrated right now up to the holidays; Breathe. Breathe with me. You've got this. We've got this. I'm proud of you. Even if you're not right now, just remember: I am proud of you.",

If I stop talking and stare at him he'll look up and say 'I'm listening'. When I finish talking the silence hangs in the air. And it stays that way until I bring up another subject or leave the room and come back. I'm sorry every time I bring it up. It's like, Please, just say something, anything, even if it's half hearted? What about 'okay I heard you'? Or FFS, would it too much to ask you just say something along the lines 'that sucks, sorry you went through that'. I don't even dream of him responding with critical engagement, or god forbid- HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT. Okay, rant over.\n\n\nI had sinus surgery a couple weeks ago, I didn't even know I had slowly lost my sense of smell and taste over the course of the last 15 years. All I knew is I couldn't breath through my nose and allergies since we moved were unbearable. After the surgery it's been a slow recovery but good god- the smells and tastes! I'd forgotten, it's like a whole world has opened up again... Good and bad. I'm having flash backs every day. I walk into a deli- boom! The smell of the deli, I'm 8 years old with my grandfather getting sandwiches before he goes to the bowling ally. I take a sip of soda- boom! I'm 13 years old, drinking this very soda on vacation with BPDmom incredibly pissed off about something.\n\n\nI had a nightmare last night, ndad had been invited to my church. I was trying to convince the pastor he's a predator and not to let him near the kids and no one believed me. I tried to tell him the altar calls ndad responded to, the ones I've witnessed first hand in the past complete with tears in his eyes, are a farce used to manipulate and extort you later. How many times has ndad looked me in the fucking eyes and gently, sweetly said how much he and God love me, WHILE AT THE SAME FUCKING MOMENT DRAINING MY BANK ACCOUNT, stealing my inheritance and my identity? You know how I know he's fucking me over now? If he dares talk about God's love. That's the twist of the knife.\n\nIn the dream I ranted and raved in the pastors office, yelling the worst of the abuse stories trying to scare him, trying to convince the pastor I'd hold him and the church liable if ndad took another child victim. I threatened a law suit if any babies got hurt. I held a protest outside the church, I was the only one who showed up. People felt sorry for my 'lack of forgiveness'. I looked like a humiliated pathetic idiot and ended up being chased out. Everyone rallied around the N, and he feasted on it.\n\n\nThe past couple days I've had so much suppressed anger, it comes out at inappropriate times. These nightmares I have always have the same theme: I'm not believed, I'm alone, powerless and desperate. The N \"wins\" over everyone.\n\nI know logically he's not the big bad wolf. I know he's just an opportunist, and not vindictive enough to chase me to this new church. He'll poison the well in my family, whatever. They were a lost cause. I've been nc for five years now, when does this shit show end? \n\nHas anyone had to cut out their whole family because of just the one N? How'd you get rid of your anger?",

Now I was not the greatest grandchild, but I paid attention to a lot of things my maternal grandparents taught me - how they had such horrible children I will never understand.\n\nAnyways, they were very Irish (since they were born there - coincidence ain't it?), and that has left a strong cultural impression on me that for the last couple of years I have been exploring. While I live in Canada and love my home and native land, there has been something very comforting in exploring my family's Irish heritage, and actually several elements of Irish temperament explain several aspects of my emerging personality. Seriously, I was looking at a few list of Irish cultural practices and personality quirks and it was like \"I do that, I do that, yep, that one too, were they spying on me when they wrote this?\" \n\nIt has been good to find out certain things that actually make sense now (that is why none of my family can ever say goodbye quickly on the phone), and one thing in particular has been the exploration of Irish culture, history, cuisine, and, to a moderate extent, drink (I swear, wine goes straight to my head but drinking most whiskies are like drinking water; but tea will always be my go-to drink). \n\nDuring this process I made sure to look into Irish history warts and all. There are some dark chapters that were very illuminating as to how things turned out in Ireland. But it has been great to learn where my family comes from and that they weren't all terrible bastards (it seems that my family has a habit of joining the military and the police force wherever we are).\n\nHas anyone else done something similar? Used their family's ethnic origin to start to discover a personal identity - or after investigating it suddenly understand why they do things a certain way? ",

Luckily I am in the process of addressing these problems, but every day I am amazed at how much damage she did to me and how much effort she took to try and keep me the developmental level of a twelve year old. \n\n3) That there was a period that I was more successful, and this was when the abuse became acute.  \n\n4) I am amazed I have survived, and am now pushing forward.\n\n5) It feels amazing to purge all the crap that you accumulate during a depression. It is like feeling massively lighter. \n\nI read about a lecture that a psychology prof who asked what would be more difficult to life, a huge box or a glass of water. The class said that the box would be heavier. The prof then asked one of the students to hold the glass out. After five minutes the prof asked the student how things were and the student said their arm was getting tired. The prof then said what if they held it up all day, for a week, or a year. The best thing is to set it down and leave it. In this case just keep pushing forward.",

        "text": "Today was supposed to be a mental health day for me because I have been running myself ragged for weeks with out a break. I was trying to practice some self-care before the holidays (which are always hard). But, this morning I get a phone call at 445 am (after maybe 3 hours of sleep thanks to a teething infant) from my husband that his car died. I had to strap both kids into the car to take him to the commuter lot. Bring them home, sleep for another hour and a half, and take them to day care. Then I was supposed to spend the day doing nothing.\n\nI did get to sleep for a few more hours and watch some tv but my husband has been emailing me all day about the car. We thought it was maybe due to him not having changed his oil in a while and hoped an oil change would help. But alas, the fucking thing is completely dead. We only had like $2900 left to pay on it. We were so close. So now we have to go car shopping but our credit is terrible from the career changes I made since going NC. We have been slowly digging our way out, but we are in debt with no savings and we owe money to family members. So I am a ball of nerves about whether or not we can find him a car. We have to have two cars. So please send happy vibes, prayers, whatever that this works out with minimal pain.\n\nThen I talked to my aunt today (father's sister) and she got on me about calling my grandmother (their mom). My grandfather died in april and Ive been very LC with her because she cannot accept that I am NC with her son. The conversations are too painful. I told her why I don't really call and she understood and told me to do what Ive gotta do. Her birthday is this week and Ill call but Ill keep it short. Then I found out she is coming up here to spend the holidays with my nparents. We live in the same town. My Grandma has not yet met my almost 7 mo old daughter and I am afraid she is going to try and set up a lunch or something while she is here. I am not so afraid of seeing her (though i dont relish it because she WILL bring up the stuff with my parents and its hard to escape quickly when having two small children with you) but I am more afraid of my nparents knowing where I am and showing up. I wouldn't put it past them. Even if it is something as small as dropping her off and picking her up. I just cannot deal with that. Not right now. Not at all. Not after the past few months Ive had.\n\nAnd then on top of it all, my normal rock of a husband has been going through some major emotional revelations-which are good for him, he needs to do it, but it has been shifting our relationship and that scares the shit out of me. My ex husband and I grew apart and not together (and he was a pale version of my dad) and while, I know my husband and I are amazing together, I am massively triggered by  my fear of us growing apart. We had a good talk about it last night and he finally heard what I was saying. So I am having to grow with this shift-which is good and I will do-but I had to stand up for my needs too-which was hard. \n\nSo it's a lot and he is easily triggered and cycled. I cannot go into my purely rational brain as I used to do when this happens because I am trying to stay in my intuitive brain (a DBT method where your emotional brain and rational brain co-exisit. It helps me come from my most power place). But I am still learning to do it and my \"legs\" so to speak are wobbly.\n\nSo Its a lot of pressure and I want to cave and sleep for days but I can't because my husband and small children need me. \n\nAnd mercury went back into retrograde today until the 30th. I really fucking hate mercury. Mercury has fucked a lot up in my life this year.\n\nAnyways, just feeling a lot of intense emotions right now and needed to get it all out.",

It all became about my mother deserved and got, and what my dad didn't buy. \n\nNow it just makes me feel hallow inside. I bake, shop, budget and wrap.

I know my kids and my husband need me, but I'm just reminded of the years I devoted to my Nmom with no return. I feel like if I even point out that I don't get anything, I'm being like her.

I desperately want to be hoovered back up by my Nex, but I was discarded (again) and I believe she hates me at this time. I know I can't pursue her, it shows her I have no value to her at this point - or do I just go overboard and publicly call out for her and make a big show so she feels special? We were together for 8 years and I am too broken to get over her. Now I understand her condition - I just recently learned about cluster B - so I am convinced I can make it work for her if she will just take me back, just give me another chance. I know this is stupid, but how can I get her to want to suck me back in and give her the adulation she craves? I will give her EVERYTHING if she takes me back.",

She was a good supply for him.\nAllowed his abuse. \nNow I'm 6 month pregnant again, SO IS SHE.\nWe are due the same time. \n\nI kicked him out and call the police about 4 months ago now.\nHe moved to another country to be with this girl, as he didn't have any other supplies at hand and no where to live. \n\nNow I don't regret my decision to make him leave. Don't ever for a second want him back. Don't want to raise my children with him. \n\nBut it doesn't take away the fact that it hurts. A lot. \n\nI don't know whether or not I have grieved properly, or how I even go about it.\nI'm worried about how I will feel once I give birth knowing that he's off with another \"family\" and being a \"dad\".\nAnd I say dad loosely. Like even though I know he's a shit dad, and doesn't help physically or financially... it's like fuuuuuck. I don't really know... how to feel or what to think.\nHis new supply has also been very awful to me.\nOnce she found out that he had a girlfriend she made it her life's goal to ruin our relationship (she has admitted this.)\nI know she's in an abusive relationship now and I'm not, which is great. But she feels so smug with herself that she is pregnant. She's rubbed it in my face so many times. She must elated.\nShe doesn't care if she cheats or hits her, has done already to her, and once knocked her out cold... \nand I know she will inevitably end up in the same position as me. There will be more kids and baby mamas for him..\nStill. It just sucks so much. The feeling.\nRemember how I felt about him and what he was like during the first few months of our relationship and the love bombing phase. \nHow I really did love him and genuinely thought we'd be together for a long time.\nIt lasted a year basically before all the cheating came to light (and STDS). \nI just can't believe that something this traumatic had happened to me to be honest. \nI feel like I'm living in a soap opera. \n\nI just don't know how to move past this. \nHow do I just get on with my life and leave him behind me? \nWill it ever happen? \n\nI'm already no contact. \n\n\nEdit: words.

I love my husband more than myself...\n\nThat out of the way I struggle with my own abuse of my parents. I am NC of almost a year. The holidays and happy changes (new car) have made wanting to contact them extremely desireable. I know I shouldn't and I havent. My friends are doing what they can to hold me up. My husband as well but I struggle. \n\nIm feeling resentment toward my husband lately. Some of it justified some of it not. A lot of it is me feeling unable to hold him up myself. He has a very hard time during holidays.  He has abuse in his family and holidays are the roughest thing for him. His drinking increases so much I don't want to be around him. He is not abusive to me, just himself. He drinks entire bottles of wine in one sitting then tries to come and touch me (give me affection) knowing I feel disrespected. The more he drinks the more I pull away and feel less of a woman. On top of that it must be nice to drown your sorrows in drinking. If I do that I want to kill myself, being deeply depressed to begin with. \n\nDuring this time of the year I drive and listen to music and cry my eyes out. He leans on me so much for his own happiness, and I just can't do it. I have my own shit to deal with. I stopped therapy for finicial reasons, I honestly think we should go back. \n\nI'm pulling away everyday from him and he drinks more. It's a horrible cycle. All I can think is: why are we so fucked up? We love each other with all our hearts but we are barely making it. \n\nWhen we went to therapy a few months ago, we talked about everything and he understood how I felt about his drinking and seeing my reasons for how I felt he toned it down to two beers a day or a glass of wine, maybe two. Just to help his cramps from work a day relax. Now he's in full swing again.\n\nI'm barely hanging on mentally. Im thinking of packing my shit up and living in the forest for the rest of my life. I just want to run away. It's the only thing I'm good at. Jesus im a mess.",

Well my mom's family didn't like it. So much so that they said I was satanic and quoted bible verses at me. (I feel like I have to mention that I was in no way a bad kid, I was the opposite. Eagle Scout going off to college with some decent scholarships. Never in trouble. I just like rock and skateboarding) This wasn't the first time they damned me for living, but it was the last one that broke my back, causing a spiral into serious depression. It was almost a good thing because it made me see help for other problems growing up around those people do to you. I have been keeping almost no contact, however my wedding is coming in a year and my mom requested some of her family be invited. So I did aunts and uncles. She has a large family and that is already 25 people right there. We have been fighting on and off about this for well over a year. She called me today for the once a week call and she brought it up again saying her family was upset. I was upset for years and they never apologized or practiced that forgiveness thing their bible talks about. Just anything. Advice, words, I am at my ropes end and I just want to throw them all out of my life and I thought moving would do it and no contact. But what do you do when these \"life events\" force you to be with them?",

        "text": "I'm about 7 months NC, and it's Christmas time so I completely understand why I'm having flashbacks. It's an emotional time, but one thing keeps bothering me.\n\nA month or so ago I got a letter from Nmom about how she didn't expect me to respond but her therapist recommended she 'get her feelings out there'. Leaving aside the issue of what the fuck kind of therapist suggests you send a letter like that (and my suspicion that therapist never actually told her to send it, she just took his silence as consent), I'm taken aback by how rational that is. Going to a therapist seems like a very logical, normal thing to do. So normal that I questioned why I had gone NC.\n\nUntil I read her other letters to me, or have a flashback or review my Reddit posts. The main reoccurring issues were her jealousy of my relationship with my brother (yeah healthy adult siblings!!), her imagining things and then getting angry at me for not responding 'appropriately' to these imaginary events and finally her constant demands to visit or have me visit sometimes when I had just arrived! Then yeah NC was clearly my only choice, though I would be hard pressed to articulate those issues to her face. The reasons would just fall apart.\n\nSo what's going on here? She has a history of going to therapy and that didn't stop her before, so I'm not willing to think that she is changing. Is she using the therapist for N supply, or to rework the narrative so that she wasn't a shit mom? Is it a moment of healthiness?  ",

        "text": "I am not fully sure how to structure this post, because right now I kind of feel like Charlie Kelly in the Pepe Silvia episode of It's Always Sunny.\n\nTonight I was reading/watching different posts and videos about narcissism, both as a method of procrastination and because I believed that this guy I was in a \"situationship\" with was a narcissist. I found this as a source on RBN: http://www.thriveafterabuse.com/word-salad-narc-speak/\n\nAnd I literally SCREAMED in my room. It was like him, in a blog post. Prior to finding this, I wasn't sure if he was \"really\" a narcissist because wiki pages and the like were not as descriptive. But reading that page, I had flashbacks to EVERY conversation we had. Repetitive conversations, circular conversations, different masks, EXPLAINING HUMAN EMOTIONS, plausible deniability, random words and phrases. He never explicitly put me down, but would devalue me in other ways -- so that was a \"check box\" missing from a lot of sites I had previously read. Now that I have affirmed my belief that he is a narcissist, I have reaffirmed my decision to go NC with him!\n\nI was already leaning towards this after he came over on Sunday, said that \"we shouldn't do this anymore, because he met a girl that he fell in love with THAT NIGHT and she rejected him\" (this is AFTER I stuck with him despite him saying he didn't want a relationship, because he didn't feel ready for love-- silly me but it's ok I'm young-- I also was beginning to feel like something was \"up\" with him) Anyways- guess that was me being discarded. I feel bad for the next girl.\n\nHe began crying, and I just comforted him. I knew something was definitely wrong because when I would just say things like \"I'm sorry, that sounds very difficult\" or \"I believe you'll find someone else\" he would get really AGITATED and start saying more things that would have upset me in the past. He started talking about his roommate, and how he \"fixed\" him by being critical of him, because his roommate was \"so annoying\" in high school and he finally called him out, and is now \"so grateful\" to him. ??? He started talking about girls he used to fuck, he started talking about how \"powerful\" he is, and how he feels like he has the power to change anyone, and every conversation was a circular one. I had to \"explain human emotions\" because I had to tell him that being subject to uninvited criticism can be hurtful, and he was just like \"huh?\"\n\nI had to explain LOVE to him.\n\nHe would CONSTANTLY talk about other girls he had sex with, despite my requests for him not to do that. The conversations were ALWAYS about how powerful he was, how he could attract any girl he wanted to, how he could do anything.\n\nBefore Thanksgiving break, I lost it after he was super hurtful, and I got brave enough to confront him and express my hurt and he said \"Good, I meant to hurt you\" and I just started sobbing in front of him. He apologized via text over the break and said \"I don't want you to think of me as a bad person\" and barely anything about my actual feelings. \n\nI just always felt UNSTABLE with him, and as if I was unreasonable for asking for kindness and respect in a relationship.\n\nHe would always pull weird, questioning shit like asking me if I have slept with other guys, if I have slept with x person, but not in a jealous way. Just like... he needed to know. \n\nHe would always pretend like we had some kind of future, I remember him once kissing me and saying \"Don't worry, you don't have to wait much longer\" and then during Thanksgiving saying things like \"I'm ready to see where this goes, I have been emotionally closed off from you and I don't want to be anymore\"\n\nI JUST FEEL SO GOOD KNOWING THAT HE IS A NARCISSIST AND I CANNOT CHANGE HIM AND I CANNOT FIX HIM AND EVEN IF I FEEL BAD BECAUSE I KNOW HE HAD A TRAUMATIC CHILDHOOD THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO. AND I DESERVE BETTER. NO CONTACT. I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.\n\nI'm sorry this post is so disorganized, I'm a little sleep deprived and also... feeling like Charlie Kelly in the Pepe Silvia episode, connecting all the dots.",

Its normal to have two weddings in his culture, one in the bride and one in the grooms home town if they come from different cities. So with the understanding that his mother (who is very sweet and inncoent knows next to nothing about my Nmother - language is also a bit of a barrier) who is afraid of flying will not attend any celebration in my home town. \n\nFamily is king here and it will be unconscionable to not invite your mother to your own wedding. Now it turns out my future MIL will brave her fear of flying and fly long haul to join us for our second wedding in my home town. She is looking forward naturally to meeting my family, esp Nmum and EDad (divorced for decades)\n\nQuestion: How can i handle this with sensitivity to my innocent future MIL? She will want to meet my Nmother if she comes to my home town so I dont think I can avoid the situation, so no wedding invite as planned for Nmum is not really an option. Explaining NC to future MIL is almost impossible too!\n\nHelp pls I dont want to be portayed as a selfish cruel AcoN!",

Either way I don't have any regrets now.\n\nEdit: I feel a bit sad now because the only family in this country that I have is my grandmother with whom I am on friendly terms. But when she inevitably dies I won't have reason to stay or come back.",
