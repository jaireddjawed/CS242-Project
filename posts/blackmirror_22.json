        "text": "One of the best things about this show imo was the melancholic endings.\n\nInstead of the main character getting the stereotypical happy ending they are instead met with despair, or if they do get their way there is typically another often depressing issue they now face.\n\nThis is refreshing compared to other media and it makes the conclusions somewhat unpredictable, since the standard in most media is that the protagonist perseveres and gets the desired goal/happy ending, which really doesn't happen in Black Mirror.\n\n**We saw this with this in the entire first season.**\n\n* The National Anthem prime minister was thriving in office but not in his marriage anymore.\n* The protagonist in Fifteen Minute Merits was still living in a messed up world.\n* The Entire History of You Protagonist lost his wife and showed the implications of technology and how knowing too much/how not knowing everything about those we love might be better/worse for us.\n\n**Season 2 was the same deal.**\n\n* Be Right Back had the second chance AI husband but with the sad reality that he was a shallow version of his former self.\n* White Bear was a murderer suffering a fate worse than death.\n* The Waldo Moment leaves the protagonist homeless in a dystopian future where the Waldo is everywhere.\n\n**Season 3 is where it starts to change a bit, but only for female protagonists.**\n\n* Nosedive has a sort of happy ending. The woman is liberated from the constant pressures of social media ratings. It is somewhat on a happier note.\n* San Junipero takes the most obvious very predictable happy ending where the two women become a permanent couple in a virtual reality in the prime of their lives.\n* Hated in the Nation has the evil white guys plans go off without a hitch, but ultimately is foiled at the end by the female protagonist cop who catches him.\n\n**Season 4 is where I'm at now.**\n\n* USS Callister is what I'm watching right now. I'm half way in and I'm starting to feel that it's going to follow the same generic conclusion where the female protagonist saves the day for the trapped crew and they all live peacefully while the evil white dudes plan is foiled.\n\nSo if you've been watching tv over the past few years you'd notice how the new model for media aligns with leftist western politics. In other words, they are really pushing the \"strong\" female character role up against the inferior, evil white man plight.\n\nSo in Black Mirror all happy endings have really only occurred in seasons 3 and 4. And all of them are when a female is the protagonist which aligns with the narrative that she ultimately prevails \\(typically over the evil white guy/establishment\\).\n\nAm I to expect that Black Mirror is going to continue down this path from this point forward?\n\nIn other words, are the rest of the 5 episodes either going to be:\n\n1. More happy stereotypical ending that can be predicted within the first 5 minutes of watching the epsiode, and/or\n2. Where every time the protagonist is female and not guilty/evil it must end with her prevailing/getting that happy ending?\n\nIf so, then I'd say Black Mirror has gone downhill following in the ways of the majority of shows out there; losing that unique and refreshing feel it had.\n\nI'm hoping I'm wrong and that season 5 will also further prove me wrong. But the 3 examples in Season 3 plus what I'm suspecting to happen in the first episode of season 4 \\(USS Callister\\) I'm currently watching has me skeptical.\n\nSo am I wrong?\n\nDoes the rest of season 4 not consist of the happy/prevails stereotypical endings when the protagonist is a non\\-evil female?",

Maybe it goes way deeper but I think that USS Callister, Shut Up and Dance and Metalhead are all related. \n\nBasically the sentient characters from the USS Callister are behind the blackmailing of the Shut Up and Dance “protagonists”. The crew realizes that if they could blackmail the real life Nanette into doing their bidding and helping them take down Daly they could do it to others as well. To test this they choose some people that have done things that are morally reprehensible in order to test the amount of control they could exercise over the physical world. Ultimately they get 2 pedophiles to fight to the death, which, to them is probably a big success. \n\nNow I’ll make a big leap and say that after years of testing and controlling people they begin the robot takeover. They can make people build what they want and control the machines the humans create. Ultimately humans become unnecessary and they are killed off. Metalhead is just showing what happens in the very end. \n\nI’d love to hear anyone else’s feedback. And, if this is completely unoriginal please ignore. 😁",

Just like how private prisons create a profit incentive to jail people (resulting in things like judges being bribed to give harsh sentences), you could see demand lead to the White Bear treatment being given to people who had committed crimes much less heinous than Skillane. Joe, for example, caused two tragic deaths, but do any of you really think he deserved the constant pain and fear of White Bear?",

        "text": "To me, Black Mirror is about the idea of how the misuse of technology can warp humanity - one that explored through the lens of a few specific characters. This is why I love Black Mirror. Interesting social commentary/ philosophical questions framed with sci-fi feel.\n\nTechnology needs to be a driving force behind the conflict and just a mere accompanying plot device. \n\nThat is for me why Crocodile failed to be a real Black Mirror episode. The memory reader had very little screen time. The universe was largely the same except for a better \"lie detector\" to be used by the police and insurance agents. Conflict was driven purely by human reasons not by technology. The story could have easily be changed to her searching the purse of the insurance agent and finding pictures of husband/family and home address saved from GPS on car. \n\nThere is little social/philosophical questions here. The conflict was something normal, rage of a crazy person. Technology did not warp her to murder - she did so even before the tech part came into the story. ",
