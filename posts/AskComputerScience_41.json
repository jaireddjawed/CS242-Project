The aim of this is that devices such as smart Nest thermostats or chromecasts or whatever can be monitored in a way that is not immediately available to the user. So if their device is talking to someone is shouldn't be or in the case their IoT device is part of the Mirai botnet for instance, it can be seen plainly and clearly.\n\nHowever, the logging is all well and good but I want to try to tailor this way more. I am thinking of having rule based classification of devices so if I have a media hub for instance, I will tell the software it is this and there are rules in place which means it's behaviour should exhibit certain attributes. For instance, it will tend to receive more data from an address than send to. In the case where this behaviour is broken it is logged and displayed to the user. However, this doesn't seem that innovative.\n\nAny ideas on how I can really flesh out my idea?\n\n(posted in possibly not the most appropriate subreddits before this so hope this is more suited)",

        "text": "Been reading a fair share on the two fields. Love computers of all kinds and technology in general. Both hardware and software seem interesting, though I've more experience with the latter than the former.\n\nA common point I've been reading about is that you can much more easily learn CompSci on your own, while that's not the case with CompEng due to needing special materials and tools. With this, you can expand your job options farther than mostly hardware.\n\nIn this case, it seems best to go for CompEng and learn CompSci skills on your own to be better prepared, while having practical and engineering knowledge. So that brings me to my two questions. I know it's tough since people tend to lean one way or the other, but all answers welcome:\n\n1. How true is this notion that you can truly learn most/all CompSci skills on your own?\n2. With a degree in CompEng, can you get most/any job a Computer Scientist would be able to?\n3. Does the opposite to both questions apply as well?\n\nThank you very much.",

This tool could go hand-in-hand with the university's orientation process.\n\nI hope that by making that process more enjoyable and more 21st century-like, that the university will have higher retention rates.\n\nThe games are aimed to help students learn about: \n\n1. internship opportunities \n\n2. campus dining \n\n3. advising \n\n4. financial aid etc.\n\nSo my goal is to create this application that a new student could get on their phone, and during their first year, complete the challenges/games in the quest to become a model student.\nSo anyways, i'm getting ready to start the implementation process and decided to stop by this subreddit to see if anyone had any recommendations on how to tackle this. Any programs that you would recommend to start programming this.\n\nI have knowledge of C++, Java, a bit of python, SQL\nAny help or suggestions would be appreciated",

        "text": "Please help my rational, I am trying to work out the likelihood of a **4** horses passing the finish line in a particular order for every permutation of horses. I know the odds of each horse. Below I will attempt to explain what I have done so far and where I am getting stuck.\n\nI have a list of race horses and the odds that each horse will win eg :\n \nHorse Number | Odds of winning\n------------------------------\n\t\t   1 : 1 to 1\n\t\t   2 : 5 to 1\n\t       3 : 80 to 1\n\t       4 : 100 to 1\n \n\nFor simplicity sake in this example the horse number corresponds to the likelihood of a win. So the first thing I do is assign a weight to each horse (smaller being more likely to win, and larger less likely)\n \nHorse Number | Weight\n------------------------------\n\t\t   1 : 1\n\t\t   2 : 2\n\t       3 : 3\n\t       4 : 4\n \n\n(if, in a real world example, **2** horses share the same odds the weight will be the same for both of them.)\n\nNow, the most likely combination of horses passing the finish line would be **1,2,3,4** in that order, the less likely combo would be **4,3,2,1**.\n\nI have generated a list of all possible combinations of the horses, **1,2,3,4** - **2,3,4,1** -  **4,1,3,2** etc..\n\nand I would like to order them by probability of passing the finish line in that order.\n\nSo my thinking was to use the weight assigned above and the position of the horse in the finishing order to assign another weight to the combination.\n\nfor example\n\n\t    Positon        [1][2][3][4]\n\t    Horse Weight   [1][2][3][4]\n\n\nIf I subtract the position of the horse with its weight (if the result is a negative I change it to a positive) I then get a total that is smaller if its a likely combination and larger if its a unlikely combination. \n\nSo the above example :\n \n\t    combo : 1,2,3,4 : total weight = 0\n\t    combo : 4,3,2,1 : total weight = 8\n \n\nI don't know if I am on the right path here, I should probably be considering the neighbouring horses into the equation, eg if horse **1,2** are first or **1,3** are first they will have the same total weight but **1,2** should be more likely to finish than **1,3**.  \n \nAny help with my thinking would be greatly appreciated.\n",

Upper division classes have more variance as the instructors can pick and choose languages as they see fit. \n\nSome info about the curriculum for freshman/sophomore classes:\n\n* C++98 only\n* Vim/emacs for editor only\n* Raw pointers\n* Char arrays (no strings)\n* No use of any modern language features\n* Heavy on ADT use\n* Emphasis on run time performance over everything\n* Live coding proficiency demos that are pass/fail \n* Don't teach source control\n* No collaborative projects \n\nI'd love to hear about other programs and how they compare. \n\nEDIT: Thanks for the replies everyone, makes me feel a bit better about it. SET degree may have been a better choice for me, but I think I'll stick it out. \n\n\n",

If a crash occurs in kernel mode, it can halt the entire system.\n\nUser mode on the other hand is unable to directly access hardware or memory. Most applications run in user mode. Crashes that occur in user mode will only halt that application.\n\nSo on that basis, I'd say it's important for the two different modes to exist as it provides a way of helping to prevent system crashes by limiting access to hardware and memory for the majority of user level applications.\n\nBut for 4 marks, that doesn't seem like enough.

        "text": "I am a CS student, a fresher to be precise, the topic of networking and security has always fascinated me and with the ongoing cryptography and other news are only fueling the fire in my already ignited mind. I know sooner or later I would need to choose an area of specialization and I would never hesitate it to be this. I have been lurking here for sometime now and I would greatly appreciate any help you experienced people could give. I meant educational resources for a beginner in networking and security, books, internet resources,etc. I am not a total beginner in programming though, got some basics in C and am learning php and python3 in coming months.\n\n...Thanks for your time.",
