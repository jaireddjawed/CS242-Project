But room 1 evicts room 2, room 2 evicts room 3, so on, *forever*.\n\nThis happens in every configuration from my (admittedly limited) reading of the problem. Doesn't that mean that for *x* new guests, you will always have *x* guests in need of a room?\n\nBy that concept of \"accommodation\", any *finite* hotel can also accommodate any amount of new guests. Let's say a hotel with 32 occupied rooms has one new guest. Put new guest in room 1, room 1's guest in room 2, and so on. But what about room 32's guest? Why, we put them in room 1! Then room 1's guest moves to room 2, and so on...\n\nIf it didn't matter that there are old guests in need of rooms, there'd be no paradox. It would be \"put new guest in room 1. Tell room 1's guest to hit the road. \" But obviously, it is considered a problem that there is an old guest without a room. Therefore, the problem must only be considered solved when there are no more guests in need of a room. But that never actually happens, does it?\n\nHow is the \"solution\" to Hilbert's Hotel not simply saying \"out of sight, out of mind\"?",

I do use various sources to learn math or just to admire ist beuaty.\n\nBut it seems to me that studying maths in the US is very different as to studying it in Germany.\n\nWhat's the difference for Calculus and Analysis for you all and are proof classes very common?\n\nIn Germany we don't have any classes on writing proofs or calculus classes. The first classes you take are linear algebra and analysis (mostly real analysis with convergence, epsilon-delta criteriums, integration and so forth). But we do learn proofs on the go in those classes. We also don't have something like calculus. As far as I understood Calculus classes come before Analysis classes and aren't proof based right?\n\nI would appreciate if someone could tell me how studying maths in the US or elsewhere in the world looks like. It's very interesting how it seems to different dramatically. What do you think are pros and cons of the system your are studying in?\n\nI can tell you that doing proofs right of the beginning is a bit challenging and it does look like this for many students. I think, on the one hand it's very practical to start with them as soon as possible and to get familiar with proofs, but that early?",

For instance here is a plot of the function on the upper half circle (where brightness is the angle, which is why you get those sudden jumps). \n\n[Graph of the analytical continuation](https://preview.redd.it/ebx9al4f4nma1.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=077daf1407824a2bf91c1b78ad14a722371da2d9)\n\nI notice a few interesting properties when graphing this function. For one, the poles and zeroes seem to always come in pairs. In the graph above, the jump in brightness seems to create lines, and those lines always connect a pole with a zero. Is this something special, or do lots of functions satisfy this property? The location of the poles of this function are predictable, they are just the (n+1)th roots of 1/4. However, what is the location of the zeroes? They seem equally predictable, but I don't know of a way to compute them directly.   \n\n\nThe function f(z) is only defined up to |z|&lt; 1/2 initially. However, the image above is its meromorphic continuation up to |z|&lt;2, where it has a natural boundary. I'm interested if there are any ways to continue this function beyond its natural boundary. Many Lambert series can be continued beyond their natural boundaries by simply plugging in values. For instance, f(z) = ∑ 1/2\\^n x\\^n/(1+x\\^n) is one such series, and one can construct many more. I wonder if there is a way to continue this series in a way that agrees with those other methods. Does anyone have ideas on this?   \n\n\nAlso, here is a domain coloring graph that is a bit more standard-- in particular, it has the hue corresponding to the angle. The log of the size is graphed, which makes it easier to recognize poles and zeroes. I've also graphed it on the full circle this time. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pzh3ykqe7nma1.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5588c14c05f141dab4223293161852d4e91996c8",

In the talk, the primary claim was that we could automate brute case checking, such as in the four-color theorem, making papers more conceptual, readable, and easy to produce. Secondly, the speaker said that tech like Lean may change math pedagogy, where code may be presented in parallel with written proofs to make them more precise. \n\nAfter the talk, I wondered, given the advent of machine learning and NLP, could we marry a proof checker with a certain model trained with the thousands of proofs written in Lean in order to potentially generate novel proofs automatically? At the very least, it should be possible to automatically convert written papers to code using natural language processing imo, which feels pretty significant, but I don’t hear too much buzz about it. What do you guys think?",

It’s hard to describe exactly, but I think it can be best described as OCD like actions or thoughts, or maybe overthinking. I’d like to be clear I’m not just saying OCD as a buzzword; I’ve displayed very specific OCD like symptoms as a child, extremely intrusive thoughts to the point where they made me depressed, specific actions and sequences (i.e. compulsions) I felt compelled to do over and over, or a specific number of times etc.\n\nAnyway, basically what happens is that I’ll pick some straightforward, obvious even fact about the mathematics I’m studying and force myself to think about it until I get a strong conviction is true.\n\nLike take the fact that modus pones is a valid logical rule of inference. I feel like I know this rationally, but then I realize I don’t have a strong “conviction” about it’s truth, it doesn’t feel true deep down. So I’ll repeat the relevant ideas over and over in my head until I’m satisfied I’ve made my conviction strong enough, or until I get tired and move on eventually.\n\nThis frustrates me because logically I know these facts are obvious. We can prove them to be true clearly. But because they don’t feel intuitive enough to me or obvious enough I force myself to waste time and energy trying to generate this feeling of conviction that it’s true.\n\nSorry if this is weird and doesn’t make sense. I’ve also considered seeing a therapist too.",

        "text": "Oftentimes in math, I feel like one can re-understand an older, elementary theorem with more advanced techniques. I was wondering if anyone could give some examples of this! Here are some of my own.\n\nThe Jordan normal form can be proven at the end of a first course on linear algebra, but the proof is a bit tricky. It's easier to use the classification of k\\[x\\]-modules. For a sketch: Let V be a finite dimensional vector space over an algebraically closed field k, and let T : V -&gt; V be an endomorphism of V. Then we can view the underlying additive group V as a k\\[x\\]-vector space, by letting elements of k act as scalar multiplication, and letting multiplication by x just be T; then the classification of k\\[x\\]-modules reveals the Jordan normal form.\n\nAnother example, from number theory, is that a prime number p is a sum of two squares if and only if p = 2 or p is 1 mod 4. There are various elementary proofs of this, but one particularly quick argument is to note that p = a\\^2 + b\\^2 if and only if p = (a+bi) \\* (a-bi), if and only if p is not a prime in Z\\[i\\] (this requires a small amount of algebra but isn't tricky). And to check if p is a prime in Z\\[i\\], we can just directly compute\n\nZ\\[i\\]/pZ\\[i\\] = Fp\\[x\\]/(x\\^2+1), \n\nwhich is a field if and only if x\\^2 + 1 is irreducible in Fp.\n\nDoes anyone else have any examples they'd like to share, where a theorem with an elementary proof can wind up becoming much conceptually simpler if you prove it in a more advanced way?",

Please be gentle.)*\n\nFrom what I understand, modern set theory came about largely because the naïve definition of “set” is inconsistent: the “set” of all sets not containing themselves contains itself if and only if it doesn’t.  So we make the definition of “set” axiomatic and precise, and we call a more general “naïve set” a collection.\n\nBut to an undertrained perspective, this solves nothing.  We’ve merely transferred the same unanswerable question from “sets” to a functionally similar object (a “container”) with a different name.  The problem is semantics-independent and isn’t fooled just because we’ve released its grip from “sets.”  We might *still* ask if the definition of “collection” is consistent: does the collection of all collections not containing themselves contain themselves?  And if it doesn’t exist … says who?  Aren’t collections there to be more general than set theory axioms will allow? \n\nBut such an obvious question couldn’t possibly escape over a century of deep thought, so I’m missing or oversimplifying something.  What have I not understood?\n\nThank you!",

        "text": "Greetings, /r/math,\n\nSo (at least in the US), many graduate schools have sent out or are starting to send out offers for Fall 2023 programs, and many prospective graduate students are starting to make their decisions about which graduate school to attend.  So it's time for us to hold the 18th /r/math **Graduate School Panel** for 2 weeks starting **Monday March 13, 2023**.  In this panel, we'll welcome any and all questions about going to graduate school and the application process.  We'll also have a bunch of helpful resources regarding graduate school.  \n\n**Here is a link to the** [**first**](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/21u1ix/rmath_graduate_school_panel/)**,** [**second**](http://redd.it/2kh7et)**,** [**third**](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/30t9gn/rmaths_third_graduate_school_panel/)**,** [**fourth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/49egld/rmaths_fourth_graduate_school_panel/), [**fifth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/5e5d91/rmaths_fifth_graduate_school_panel/), [**sixth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/60hbdz/rmaths_sixth_graduate_school_panel/), [**seventh**](https://redd.it/75ajb7), [**eighth**](https://redd.it/8276ho), [**ninth**](https://redd.it/9oeen0), [**tenth**](https://redd.it/azv7ac), [**eleventh**](https://redd.it/dl2ms2), [**twelfth**](https://redd.it/fks01d), [**13th**](https://redd.it/j9tkpg), [**14th**](https://redd.it/m5n9sb), [**15th**](https://redd.it/qkh3yo), and [**16th**](https://redd.it/taipd7) Graduate School Panels, to get an idea of what this will be like.\n\nTo make this work, **we need a lot of volunteers** to help us answer all of these questions over the course of the panel.  In addition to current math graduate students (US or otherwise), we welcome perspectives from graduate students in related fields, postdocs, professors, graduates in industry, etc.\n\nIdeally, you'll be available on Monday to answer questions, but feel free to pop in over the weeks to help answer any later questions!  If you're interested in helping out, comment here or send us a message [via modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmath), and maybe say a bit about what you're currently studying!\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

We would like to see more conceptual-based questions posted in this thread, rather than \"what is the answer to this problem?\". For example, here are some kinds of questions that we'd like to see in this thread:\n\n* Can someone explain the concept of maпifolds to me?\n* What are the applications of Represeпtation Theory?\n* What's a good starter book for Numerical Aпalysis?\n* What can I do to prepare for college/grad school/getting a job?\n\nIncluding a brief description of your mathematical background and the context for your question can help others give you an appropriate answer. For example consider which subject your question is related to, or the things you already know or have tried.",

The tensile area of an M6 screw is 20.1mm²\n\nthe plates are 316 (UTS = 550MPa, Yield stress = 240MPa, Shear stress = 330MPa)\n\nThe centre plate (35mm thick) is fixed.\n\nThe two outer plates (15mm thick) have a minimum load of 600kg acting on them. This has the potential to max. out at 2000kg.\n\nI am trying to calculate the factor of safety (FoS) the screws will have.\n\nI used the following:\n\n0.6 \\* Yield Stress \\* Tensile Area / FoS (1.25) =\n\n0.6 \\* 450 \\* 20.1 / 1.25 = 4341.6N = 4.3kN\n\nThen FoS = 311 / 4.3 = approx. 72\n\nThis seems really high though, so I'm sure I have gone wrong somewhere. Also, I don't know what 0.6 is representing or where it has come from.\n\nSome calculations I have seen take into account the thickness of the plates while others only use the tensile area of the screw in their calculations and I'm struggling to verify an answer. any help is appreciated.",
