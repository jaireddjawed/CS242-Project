I just did an oil change and have checked the coolant and transmission fluid levels. Everything seems normal. My usual temperature generally goes no more than halfway on the dial, even when stopped in traffic. Now, even on the highway, it's hitting halfway and if I am stopped for a very long at all in traffic or if I'm stopped in traffic after driving a good distance, it's going above halfway maybe between a quarter and a half way to the next notch. When I was idling to check the transmission fluid it went to that point. I'm not sure what else to check. Even after more than 20 miles of driving, the transmission fluid on the dipstick wasn't overly hot. Could this at all possibly be an issue with the dial or a sensor, rather than the actual engine temperature? I'm not sure what else to check. Occasionally I've had issues with that dial, as that particular display also shows things like fuel level and outside air temperature and those aren't always accurate and it doesn't always display the outside temperature. I have in the past replace the transmission and the computer.

When I got to Napa, they said the battery was full capacity and tested ok.\n\nAdditional info, \n*this is the second time this weekend I had to jump it.\n*I ran through a big puddle during last week's storm which flooded parts of my engine, nothing through the air system thankfully, but I did need to pull my spark plugs out and dry them. Didn't really drive since then till two days ago on friday.\n*The napa guy tested my battery twice, first he selected \"flooded\" and it came back saying I had 703 cca, then tested it under my actual battery type, agm or something like that, and it came back as 598cca. He said that meant my battery drained between the two tests. Is this true or is it possible switching the battery type on the test altered results? Note, my battery is rated for 600cca.\n*my car, bought brand new, has always had issues with burning out bulbs rather quickly.\n*Despite being a 2018 model bought in 2019, I've got a 159,000 miles. I drive deliveries, so you can see how much driving I do.\n*I normally have my phone plugged in because I drive uber eats, and that sucks power like mad. It'll drain my 20ah power brick in a day.

It should he noted that prior to this, I was using the truck in 4wd low, I was driving up a steep muddy hill while hauling a heavy payload, maybe of about a few hundred pounds. There was no noise or nothing and I disengaged the hubs properly. After this, I drove the truck into a different city which was about an 8 mile drive. There was no noise on my way to the place. After a few hours, I got in and started driving. I got in my truck and as I was driving a slow but quiet thump started to develop. The thump became louder and more violent and I went into a parking lot. I looked the front end all over and found no evidence of the noise. I spend the half shafts and there was no noise. I was in a location where I had no service so I couldn't call anyone. I decided to drive it home carefully and do a proper diagnosis when I got home. I drove for about a quarter mile when the noise started to slowly fade away. As I came off a bridge and turned, I was driving straight when my front driverside wheel flung off. I stopped off the side of the road. Nothing seemed to be damaged in anyway apart from the holes on the wheel being a bit bored out in a more oval shape. The rotor also became a bit ground down from the stop. All the spindle bolts have perfect threads and all over lug nuts are missing. I have no clue how something like this would happen. Does anyone have any idea? It seems like a mystery that lug nuts would just fail like that.","upvote_ratio":0.66,"created_utc":1678635713.0},{"title":"This sound is coming from the front, not entirely sure what it can be?","author":"Banter_Bait","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/ifw80y8rddna1","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678635702.0},{"title":"3RZ-FE what's that noise?","author":"MoboCross","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/4qld74dfvbna1","text":"You can hear the noise clearly after 1500rpm, it doesn't sound deep like a rod knock.

Well, I ended up getting it off with a different 3 prong jaw wrench. I went ahead and tried to finish the oil change myself, my dog knocked over my oil jug so I walked to an O\u2019Reilly\u2019s to get a new jug, got home, put the drain plug and new filter on, put the oil in, put the oil cap on top of the engine back on and started the car. The oil light on the dash was on so I went over really quick to check for leaks and the filter was pouring out oil. Shut the car off, pulled the filter off and made sure the old gasket was out, it was. Put the filter on hand-tight and tried again. Same deal. All my oil starts gushing out as soon as I turn the car on. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m just not able to get the filter on tight enough. I\u2019m a 22 year old girl and I\u2019m honestly not that strong, so I feel like it makes sense. I went ahead and had the car towed to a shop to get this change finished tomorrow morning. Just curious if it could be something obscure causing all the oil pouring out or if I\u2019m right about not being able to tighten it enough. Just worried about getting hit with a major repair bill tomorrow. Also, I\u2019m concerned I might\u2019ve caused engine damage running the car with all the oil gushing out. It was cumulatively maybe 90 seconds of running it in this condition. \n\nNote: Never had any oil leak issues prior to this debacle. Definitely wasn\u2019t a double gasket situation and when I pulled the new filter off I saw that the leak was definitely coming from the filter section not somewhere else.

I\u2019m curious if the dealership model is hourly, commission, or a combination of the two?  \n\nOne thing I really appreciate about my shop is we are not paid commission and therefore there is no incentive to sell unnecessary repairs, I wonder if you feel pressured to do so or if there is a negative financial effect on you for not upselling? Not exactly sure how much contact you have directly with the customer as I act both as the tech and service advisor currently. \n\nI am currently pursuing my ASE certifications, and I\u2019m curious as to how much impact they will actually have in terms of pay and hiring? \n\nDoes the dealership provide access to manufacture repair specifications? Currently the shop I work for does not, and we are expected to figure things out on our own. Which plays a very unique role in providing customers with estimated repair times. Usually this isn\u2019t a problem as we are about a third of the price of the neighboring dealerships, which allows us a bit more grace. \n\nIn terms of consumables, such as brake, parts cleaner, carburetor, cleaner, brake fluid, coolant, anti-seize, Lubricant, does the shop provide this or are the techs expected to buy it?\n\nI\u2019m sure I have a load more questions, but know I have already asked a lot. Please feel free to answer any questions I haven\u2019t asked that I may not know to ask about. I greatly appreciate everyone\u2019s time, advice, and support in any capacity that you can spare. \n\nThank you all in advance,\n- MoJo","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1678544186.0},{"title":"[Question] My friend accidentally refueled the new Kia Forte with Diesel instead of gas.

Two weeks ago, her and my FIL were driving down a particularly shitty, pothole-laden street in the neighborhood, and within a mile of leaving the house, noticed something was amiss. The front passenger-side tire had gone flat. Apparently they drove on it long enough that by the time we got there the tire was shredded. They are very hands-off with car trouble in this family, and AAA was already on the way. When they arrived, AAA put on the spare, and my in-laws were back on the road. Literally minutes later, the front \\*driver\\*-side tire had gone flat! AAA gets called again. She ended up replacing all four tires the next day, there was lots of conjecture about possible sabotage by disgruntled neighbors, but we moved on with our lives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward two weeks, and last night on the way home from a concert, my FIL gets a flat \\*again\\*, on the front driver-side. AAA was going to take three hours, so I went and changed it myself. Then today, I went out with some soapy water and tried to find the source of the leak. There are no nails sticking out or obvious punctures, but I did notice air escaping from where the bead contacts the rim (I'm an amateur at all this, I just looked up these terms ten minutes ago). There are two spots that look abnormal (see pictures), as if the seal was broken. Her rims are kind of beat up looking, so I am wondering if that could be the cause of these repeated flats.

I'm the owner of a RAV4-2 (2005, phase 2) D4D 2l diesel.

In fact, after I press the clutch pedal, I need to press the gas pedal to be able to select the gear with the gear lever. \n\nRight now, I operate the vehicle as follows : I engage clutch fully ; then I press the gas pedal gently (exactly as if I wanted to revmatch) ; I select the gear (or N) ; I release clutch.\n\nIf I dont follow this procedure, it is extremly hard to move the gear lever, like if I was about to break it.

So here's the story so far:\n\n* Car cut out, wouldn't restart, replaced battery but didn't fix, towed to mechanic\n* Sat for a few days, car ran normally for mechanic, they assumed fuel line just had air bubble, took it home\n* Cut out on drive home (after approx. 5km), wouldn't start but got code P2293\n* Had cracked N276 + the code so replaced HPFP and it started\n* Ran for longer (10km or so) but cut out again on drive home\n* P2293 code gone but new code P310B, so replaced G410 sensor, car started and ran\n* Got even further this time (about 20km) but cut out once again\n* P310B came back so replaced fuel tank pump and fuel pump control module\n* This time didn't run. P310B is gone but still wont start.\n* Previously it had occasionally started properly for 3-4 seconds and then died, but this now rarely happens (still sometimes though).\n* When it starts it runs perfectly, so I doubt any timing issues.\n\nKnown good parts:\n\n* Fuel Tank Pump - Replaced (tested at 6.something bar with pressure gauge so fuel filter also fine)\n* Fuel Pump Control Module - Replaced\n* G410 Low Pressure Fuel Sensor - Replaced\n* High Pressure Fuel Pump (inc. N276 valve) - Replaced\n* HPFP Cam Follower - Replaced (looked fine before replacing)\n* Battery - Replaced (and voltage tested good)\n* Spark Plugs - Replaced\n* Coil Packs - Replaced\n\nOnly other reported code was something about the PCV system\/purge valve but I can't remember, I didn't write it down as I assumed it was just due to messing around with the PCV hoses when testing things.
