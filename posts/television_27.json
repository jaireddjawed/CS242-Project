But while searching , I’ve noticed something. I’ve seen it in other type of shows outside of sitcoms too and in movies . But the sitcoms/shows from the 80s and 90s , they’ll usually cast someone in their early to mid 20s to play a teen . But nowadays they usually cast  actors around the characters ages (like stranger things) . Both have their pros and cons . So like for the 20 year olds playing the teens , ur allowed to do more with them then u would a teen playing them cause their over age of whatever that character does . They also have more experience and usually in general better actors . But for the teens , they generally look like and act like their characters age group . For some ppl , it’ll take them out of the scene cause the 14 year old is played by a 20 year old so he’ll  or she’ll most likely look like a 20 year old instead of a 14 year old . So which do u generally prefer? Acting skills aside (cause Ik most ppl are gunna say they don’t care as long as the acting’s good lol)",

Yeah the writers flirt with him cheating a bit but he’s so convincing in his cheating refusals that he just reinforces any doubt about his marital commitments.

And _The Starry Love_ (Youku) is also probably going to come out within the next week or so. It seems possible that there will be 3 relatively big budget xianxia premiering all at once—?       \n\nIt’s not clear why Youku would release 2 dramas in the same genre at the same time to compete with one another, except with the sole intention of torpedoing _Chong Zi_ into smithereens. So perhaps it’s the case that _BFtB_ and _TSL_ will air one after the other rather than simultaneously.",

As a subscriber I am afraid to watch any netflix originals for fear of being left hanging.\n\nWhy would anyone want their show on netflix?\n\nCome to think of it, why would anyone watch any show on netflix that didn’t already complete its run on another network?\n\nHow the fuck is netflix still around? Seems like they should have completely failed as a company more than a year ago. Any idea what is keeping netflix afloat?",

        "text": "I love the Boys and Antony Starr's performance as Homelander so when this show popped up in my recommendations on HBO Max I was intrigued to see a scruffy, shorthaired and decidedly brunette Antony Starr playing the role of a recently free convict who took the identity of a small town sheriff in Pennsylvania. \n\nSo far I really like it. It's not as good as True Blood, but I don't need it to be. I'm intrigued by the concept and seeing how Starr's performance here anticipates, or doesn't, his iconic role as Homelander. It's most definitely not the prestige tv we usually associate with HBO, at least as far as I can tell from one episode, the writing is so-so and there are parts where it looks a little cheap. It feels like something you'd see on Starz or Showtime more then HBO. It is however unmistakably pre-#MeToo. Within 5 minutes of the fucking episode we have Antony Starr and some chick banging against a wall. There is gratuitous nudity sprinkled through this whole thing and over the top violence.   \n\n\nClassic Alan Ball/HBO\n\nIt is interesting to me how much things have changed since Metoo. Look at shows like House of the Dragon or Succession are all much more tasteful and restrained with how the employ sex scenes or nudity. \n\nBut beyond that there is a joy to just indulging in this fantasy, somehow believing that an ex-con could somehow get into a gunfight in the middle of NYC that ends with a double decker bus falling over to one side and exploding, and then assume the identity of a sheriff in a town like 4 hours away. Not to mention the ridiculously plot convenient sheriff that manages to get himself killed and also be a complete unknown to anybody in the town beyond his name (apparently pictures weren't a thing back in 2013)  and that he's from out of town. \n\nBut if you can swallow those very obvious problems and accept this isn't a high art show, its fun to play with the idea of what it would be like if someone could be this freaking lucky.  However, the title sequence is godawful. It looks super cheap, the music sucks, and the typeface for the main credits is painful to look at. Which is fucking insane considering how iconic True Blood's opening was.",

It also saddens me that he was let go very early in Season 15, with only an explanation that it was due to Mandatory retirement that was announce when Dann Florek announce his departure. \n\nI found this article that was publish near the end of season 14, was renewed for season 15.\n\n[https://www.huffpost.com/entry/law-and-order-svu-season-15\\_n\\_3314321](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/law-and-order-svu-season-15_n_3314321)\n\n\"I'd be a fool to say I didn't want to do it anymore and I'm certainly not bored with the character because the writing is so good,\" Belzer told The Huffington Post. \"He's very close to how I would be if I were in that situation, so it's a dream.\"\n\nBelzer really doesn't indicate that he wanted to retire John Munch.

Again - no spoilers from me.\n\nFirst of all, the show is beautiful to look at. Everything on the screen is framed beautifully - from panoramic shots of nature to conversations to action sequences - just beautiful. The writing is also perfect from the plotting to the dialogue. There isn't one bit of it that's extra or missing. I love screenwriting like that. Finally, the acting is superb. I thought it would be the Kevin Costner show but it isn't. Every character down to minor ones is drawn so well and acted as well as it's drawn up. The standouts for me are Kellie Riley as Beth and Wes Bentley as Jamie. Every scene they are in draws your concentration on them. It's beyond superb for me. The reality is there are no bad performances. It they just fit.\n\nThe show is far more emotional than I thought it would be and filled with a great deal of sadness, but it's good to watch something that makes you feel. Great show.",

Such as when Merchant's entitled character is strolling through a party, sees a woman from behind, turns her around to look at her face and says \"not a model\" and keeps moving on.  \n\nSad to see this was another one season casualty from HBO.   I can see people not liking it for whatever reason but it certainly has filled a void between a few shows I'm waiting to return.  \n\nWho else has seen this?  Thoughts?",

        "text": "With Ally McBeal on Amazon Prime I've been able to watch all five seasons again.  I had forgot how much I enjoyed the series back in the day. If they made a remake what would you like continued in the new series?\n\nIn no particular order:\n\nCage, Fish and Ally would have to be the original actors, well as well the other original characters. Also I'd prefer none of the new characters from season 5 in the new series. I just could never warm up to them.\n\nI'd like to see Ally move back to Boston and join Cage &amp; Fish to become Cage-Fish and McBeal.\n\nAlly's daughter has become an attorney following her mothers footsteps, maybe married, maybe with a child.\n\nFish would be single from a divorce, back to his wattle.\n\nCage would be his same old quirky self and married or significant other.\n\nI'd enjoy seeing Renee, I missed her in season 4. Maybe also joining Cage, Fish and McBeal.\n\nRobert Downey Junior maybe could have some appearance's but not as the love of Ally's life or maybe yes.\n\nElaine must be in the series not sure how her life may have turned out. Might be cool if she got a law degree.\n\nGeorgia, Ling and Nelle I am not sure about, how would they work into the story. I never warmed up to Nelle till season 4.\n\nHow to capture that quirky, surreal comedy, drama and music from the late 90's? Oh well my two cents and that's about all its worth.",

ABC, CBS, and NBC all are crystal clear, but FOX tries to cram 10 channels through their limited bandwidth and the end result is just atrocious. At least, that's been my observation in the Twin Cities market.",
