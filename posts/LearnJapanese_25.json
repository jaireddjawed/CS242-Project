If you're not interested or dont need and just accept me as I am, you can jump to \"MY PROBLEM IS\" part.\n\n My learning plan for Japanese was:\n\n1- Learn hiragana and katakana from duolingo\n\n2- Learn essential conjunction, suffix, postpone and stuff from duolingo\n\n3- Then go for raw manga and learn along the way while consuming japanese content.\n\n4- After being familiar with the language, go watch anime first with japanese subtitled then without to gain fluent reading speed and  ear familiarity.\n\n5- For, cherry on top, watch variety shows( for daily use of language), read books( for literature)\n\nI know Turkish ( my mother language and similar to Japanese by way of language structure) and English ( I can say its advanced, study my university department english and read books in english). Learned how to read Arabic when I was kid ( Religious reasons, have no idea if I still can). Therefore I know how to approach a language while learning it. Because I often think about different language structures, intonations effect on society, because its fascinating.\n\nIts not arrogance, the reason I dont follow a guidebook or teacher, its the experiences of time I wasted by these guides and teachers. So when I learn something, I try to be as active and self taught-comprehend as possible.\n\nMY PROBLEM IS I've been studying 30min everyday with duolingo for a month and I'm currently at Unit 5. I expected to learn it in a month but there is only disappointment. Can you suggest me more efficient path for learning hiragana and katakana.Also if you think 30 min. is not sufficient, I can increase it to 1h. at most but I dont think thats the problem.",

There's short phrases written in subtitles, in text messages, and hand written notes.  When they do speak, they often do so slowly, to match the speed of their sign langauge.\n\nThat said, while I can recommend the movie as something even lower-level learners can feel like they understand, I can also recommend the movie more broadly, as just a gorgeous film with an interesting story and fantastic performances.",

        "text": "As an actual academic linguist, I felt compelled to make this post based on another post I saw today. Someone was claiming to be a _Japanese linguist_  but went on to describe their role as someone who can speak Japanese and who has a general love for the language. __That is not what a linguist is…__\n\nEssentially, there are two official uses for the term _linguist_: ① in the academic setting, one who studies linguistics (the scientific study of human language(s)), and ② in the military setting, one who trains themselves in a certain language so as to be able to use that language in field work.\n\nTo hear someone relate my actual profession to just “liking” or “using” said language feels degrading and almost insulting. Do you realize how many hours of study and work go into becoming an actual linguist? Do they realize how many thousands of dollars go into paying for such an education? If you work as a translator for that language, you are a translator, not a linguist. If you interpret, you are an interpreter, not a linguist. Now actual linguists may have such skills, of course, but a distinction needs to be made based on actual training and qualifications. Please do not degrade or misuse my actual profession which I have put so many years into.\n\nYou are not a linguist. You are a language enthusiast at best. \n\n~End rant~",

I am about to choose my destination for my semester abroad in university and I am very conflicted.  \n\n\nOn the one hand I have always wanted to go to Kyoto because I am a Japanese Language and Culture student and damn I want to see all those temples and shrines and castles so hard... so Kyoto would be the top 1 option.  \nBut the problem is that my University only offers an exchange with Kyodai in the last semester of my last year, so that would mean losing one year between my bachelor and master degree (bureaucracy and grades conversion stuff). The other option would be Doshisha which is pretty decent from what I heard and has a nice Japanese language program, but of course it's not Kyodai ):\n\nOsaka University is another option, but the exchange would last 10 months instead of 5, and I am poor (I could try JASSO as I have a GPA of 3.94/4, but I would get the results just before leaving, and don't know if I want to bet on the money I need to live on the other side of the world honestly).\n\nThen there's Keio: lovely and very prestigious Uni, but it's in Tokyo, and I heard of people who didn't find it easy to make Japanese friends and stayed in the \"international bubble\" while in Tokyo. Plus: maybe I am being orientalist af, but Kyoto just seems richer in culture and tradition.  \n\n\nDo you guys have any suggestions on which university to pick? Is prestige of the Uni important as an exchange student who will only spend limited time there matter? Do you prefer Tokyo, Kyoto or Osaka?",

As of now, I think I’m at a N5 level. \n\nI really want to get back and finally make this language my own once and for all, but I don’t want to study it on school grammar books anymore. I need suggestions for books (whether it’s an exercise book or novels) , youtube channels, series, movies  that can help me improve my kanji/vocabulary, something that could help me improve and make me fluent with a “everyday” japanese and not an academic one.\n\nThank you and happy holidays!",

        "text": "Besides learning the diary 2 thousand individual kanjis is not functional because the massive majority of the times you see kanji they are in conjunction, therefore whatever the reading you learned of so kanji that's part of so conjunction or the meaning of it will not stay the same because now it works in a dynamic.\n\nBesides each of those kanji having about 6 different readings, the so conjunctions will have, for example, at least 3 kanjis united, and you only know one of them, for example, the only reading you know from this kne kanji is not the reading that is used in the formation of so conjunction and, if you, somehow, get it right, there are two more kanjis to bet on luck that you will even know at least one of their 7 possible readings, and, for the finale, if you don't know all of the kanji readings, you won't know the word's reading, you might at max know the first, the middle one or the last one's reading but it won't matter, because about the word itself, wich is the point of it all, you won't get any clue of it.\n\nBesides, if you get to know 2 of the 5 possible readings for the first one, 3 of the 5 possible readings for the second one and 1 of the 3 possible readings for the last one, you cam be absolutely sure that, whatever readings are the ones you know are not the ones that are used to form that conjunction. Then it ends up being one of the 3 ones you didn't know of the first, the 2 of the second and of the last one.\n\nAnd if, miraculously, you get to know all of the readings of all of the kanjis included, how will you know which combination is the right one?\n\nAnd if, miraculously, you get to know the reading of the conjunction, but you only know the meanings of the kanjis themselves alone, individually. Then it all begins again, if you know two of the kanji's meaning, it means nothing, if you know only one, it means even less, if you know all three, you might get the very idea of what the word is expressing but you don't actually know the word's exact meaning until you learn the word itself's meaning, it's about dynamic after all.\n\nAnd, mixing the reading complexity with the meaning complexity, it almost always happens like this: 3 kanjis, you know the meaning and the reading of the first one, you only remember the meaning of the third one and you know absolutely nothing of the third one - it ends up that the first one's reading altogether with the other kanjis and in unity of the word itself used the one reading you didn't know of + it's individual meaning has very little relevance (and the more kanji the word has, the less relevance one kanji's individual meaning has is conjunction); the second one's meaning has the same effect as the first one's one reading that you knew that was not actually used on the conjunction: none and the third one is a mystery. And, at the end of the day, the dynamical meaning of the whole kanji is not just unknown because you only know kanji's meaning on their own but the help those individual kanji meanings give to the word discovery is entirely abstract.\n\nYou know combination of license plate? It feels just like that.\n\nAnd all that's with only 3 kanjis, imagine more. And also, that's only about the reading part, imagine of the listening-to-writing, the writing part and there's also the formation of words based on kanjis, you will never actually get to form a word that actually exists so you will have to go decorating words with kanjis and its thousands of possible readings and meanings until you finally do it.\n\nIf, in sequence, you got 15 kanjis right and 1 wrong, you don't think \"oh, well, I only got one wrong\", but more likely \"oh, well, I only got fifteen right\", because, if you don't know every kanji, it's easier to just assume that the 15 were exceptions rather than the 1 being one.\n\nWhat the heaven should I do? Am I being too extreme? Is there any solving for any of those problems?\n\nAnd there are also those cases where I know the word but I don't know it's kanji, so,, there's no meaning, me, knowing the word's reading and meaning if, when it appears to me, with its damned absurd 21 strokes kanji, I don't recognise the word so it just stays in the unknown side for me.\nI know many words, but, very less than half of the amount of words I know, Is the amount of kanjis I know, and not surprisingly, 70+% of those words I know are formed by kanji but 4% of those 70+% of words I know is the amount of kanji knowledge I got.\n\nSo I know it's wise to not focus on kanji that much and just focus on the understanding and decoration of the words themselves, but then it makes everything even more expansive. And also, I kind of feel like getting attached to kanji and forcing to master them is the same thing as trying to decorate english word's radicals to try to form and get inducement to the rest of english language. It's like decorating the kanji tele (from the conjunction \"television\") for example and expect that, decorating radical from radical will, someday, give you vast knowledge of the language you're trying to learn.\n\nAnd besides all that stuff, not only dynamical work on kanji is hard but individual itself is too, so it wouldn't help much otherwise anyway.",

It would always yield a big “?”\n\nOne particular time, I remember saying “oh, we can play it by ear” and she was so confused. I know intuitively what that phrase means and how to use it, but while I was trying to explain what I meant in plainer terms I realized how bizarre of a phrase it is. I actually haven’t looked into the origin of that particular phrase, but even if I knew where it came from, it’s such a bizarre thing to hear and be expected to understand if you haven’t grown up around it, and not something you can just KNOW without having heard it a million times. I can’t even imagine how surreal that’d feel. Like, knowing a language, and then having someone utter a phrase that makes zero sense whatsoever based on the (correct) meanings you’ve learned of all of the words involved in the phrase. Some idioms you can kinda figure out what it’s suggesting from context, but that one? How could you ever\n\nAfter that, that particular idiom became an in-joke that we used often, but in general I made a conscious effort to speak really plainly and avoid cutting corners in my sentences by throwing in idioms whenever possible as I had grown accustomed to. I found it so difficult to do; only through that did I realize how many I use and how often I use them.\n\nAll of that is to say, now that I’m learning Japanese, I can hardly imagine how many phrases I have yet to encounter that literally will make zero sense (even if I’ve obtained a full understanding of the language) unless I’m “in the know” about them. I imagine the only real way to pick up on them is to have conversations like the one I had with her where I go “?” to something a Japanese speaker says and have it explained to me more plainly.\n\n*TLDR: got any personal favorite / interesting / pretty commonly used but make zero sense unless you’re “in the know” / etc Japanese idioms you’d be willing to share? I’m interested in learning a bunch of them. I wonder how many have near 1:1 “English equivalents” or how many are like, exclusively used in Japan. I know 「悪因悪果」from WaniKani but idk how common that really is. If you do share something, I appreciate it!*",

Is there a service with Japanese movies that is okay with the fact that I'm in the U.S. and actually lets me pay them? \n\nI have a VPN, but I wish there was something like Google Play that didn't make me pretend I was not in the US, but let me rent things in raw Japanese.",
