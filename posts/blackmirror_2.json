        "text": "I never thought about it this deeply, but our society is based a lot about memories and being able to remember things. One of my biggest questions is however Liam being a lawyer in this case. Since they have grains, there is basically no need to study for exams, since they can all recall textbooks from the grain. So basically a lawyer in that universe maybe needs a couple months to read and “memorize” the books and done. Same as for majority of other professions. In our world chosing a profession is heavily influenced by our intelligence and memorisation ability. So a lot of “less smart” people go into phyiscal jobs or so that don’t require a ton of studying. It begs the question, wether in that universe there can still be factory workers, costruction workers etc, i mean it is more appealing to anyone to have a highclass profession. On the other hand, maybe it is some sort of post socialist universe where teachers, doctors, lawyers, social workers etc are all paid the same, since no job really depends on mental abilities. In our society being a lawyer is also a status symbol of being a hard worker and exceptially smart. Like “omg you are a lawyer, damn respect i could never learn so much by heart”. These people spend 5-6-7pr however many years just learning stuff. With a grain this time can be shortened to a couple months. All the high prestige jobs from our society would lose their sentimental vale.",

I can very easily see myself in the same position if such a game was real and to recreate people exactly, consciousness and all is just a work of genius.\n\nTo recreate people in the game with all of their personality is obviously going to lead to conflict and the demonstration of sadism on display is outrageous.\n\nI think this is my favourite Black Mirror yet with The Entire History of You being a close second. I love the obvious nods to Galaxy Quest. It's like a dark version of that film.\n\nIs it bad that I wanted their plan to fail?",

A lot of people seem to back Ffion and that Liam was an abusive insecure husband and he deserved it. (Went through the comment sections).\n\nI don’t know about you guys, but I 100% Liam. Yes he lost his mind and did some weird stuff, but as he said himself “look what you have done to me, this is not me”. Yes, he could have handled the situation better, but Ffion was much more evil. She lied and tortured him emotionally. In that universe losing you grain is like a death sentence, as you could see Helen was ignored by thr police after they asked her about her grain footage. So she made Liam commit suicide in this sense. He can’t be empleyed and even all his bad memories are cause by Ffion. (Which he needs to delete). I noticed that usually the mentally unstable “weirdo”-s are this shows bad guys, but in this case idk. What is your take?",

It also made me think of how I didn’t call my dad enough before he died and how I probably don’t fall my mom enough.

But another one that hits but in a good way was Hang the DJ. It made me feel seriously happy and hopeful. The connection they had I thought was really special and translated well on screen. It also really represented how terrible constant dating is or being stuck in a bad relationship for awhile. I found it really clever and romantic that their percentage was how many times they figured it out together as ran away together saying “fuck it.” It always makes me smile and have goosebumps and even tear up when they spot each other in the bar smiling.

Perhaps even the second half of the movie could be Kenny”s trial. Because honestly it’s a pretty open ended question because we don’t know for sure what happened to Kenny. I’m not a lawyer (and also from the US) but whatever evidence the hackers gave to the police is probably inadmissible but him robbing the bank would probably have him sent to jail for a couple years. There is just so much story left untouched like how did his family react, what is the general public opinions of the hackers, is this an ongoing problem in this universe.",

Shut up and dance - kept me on my feet, was stressful to watch, roller coaster of emotions, incredible twist and reveal at the end that forced me to watch the whole episode again to look for obvious clues. Incredible episode.\n\n2. Black museum - For similar reasons but i thought the pace of storytelling for this episode was perfect. I personally enjoy it when there’s a main plot divided into several sub plots when done correctly. A vengeance story well told. Kind of sucks to be the teddy bear lady though. \n\nAnd here comes my probably unpopular opinion\n\n1. Hated In The Nation - God if there was a solo series dedicated to this episode alone, I’d watch it. The actors absolutely killed this one imo. Also the choice in ambiance and music really created such a dark and terrifying tone with the already terrifying plot. And I might be wrong but I think this is probably the highest death count in the series ya? This is probably the only episode that I seriously wish there was a follow up. I’d love to see how they clean that mess up and continue the story.",

But it wasn't so bad afterwards - only during. (Being scared after is what I really am afraid of).\n\nBased on that which episodes would you recommend? I'm about to watch Hang the DJ based on reviews. Arkangel sounds like it might be ok too in the daytime. Which others would/wouldn't you recommend? E.g. I've heard that Shut Up and Dance is the scariest. Or isn't White Bear supposed to be really bad as well?\n\nAlso I've seen the end of Smithereens, that was powerfu acting...",

The only thing that they all remember is that right before they ended up there they saw fireworks in the sky. After all of the death games are completed they are allowed to return back to their reality. Well here comes the Black Mirror-esque plot reveal. \n\nIt turns out that the “fireworks” that the borderland players had seen were actually meteors striking down and they were all very close by and caught in the blast. The blast left their body’s in a state between life and death. The medical personnel attending all of these people said the injured people’s hearts all coincidentally stopped for exactly one minute. It is heavily implied that this one minute of no heart beat for all of these people was when they experienced their time in the borderlands. Everyone who died while playing in the death games in the borderlands also died in real life from the blast. Those who survived the games coincidentally survived the blast. It’s a very good show you would all love it.",

        "text": "I finally saw this episode last night and damn, what a roller coaster. Watching kenny come down the hill was almost uplifting at first, I thought that I was seeing an innocent young man ending his undeserved torture and was walking away a more confident person with some money to boot. I even thought he'd get off on the charges If he could prove he was under duress and killed that guy in self defence. This could of been the only episode with something of a positive ending for the main charafter; but how wrong I was. It was amazing to see a show that showed me a pedophile getting his comeuppance, but not giving me enough time to process what I just learnt and feel any kind of catharsis in seeing it. I generally still felt pity for him in that moment (now it's been a while, I'd happily say let him rot haha)\n\nObviously it's a fucked up episode but what I keep thinking about is what was the point in having him Rob the bank? No one would walk away with the money and I couldn't really see how it would make the ending any sweeter for the hackers, they already get the joy of pulling the rug from under their feet; how does them also not get a big bag of money make it any sweeter?\n\nBut now I think its the ensure that he goes to prison for a considerable amount of time. I'm honestly skeptical that kenny would of been charged with watching indecent material, I don't know the nuances of these things, but surely what the hackers have would not be admissible in court? I'd reckon that a good lawyer could easily of gotten that evidence thrown out. But by causing him to commit the bank robbery and kill a man (although it does genuinely seem that kenny acted solely in self defence in that moment), kennys fate is even more sealed. He will certainly spend time in prison and given the nature of his crimes and his demeaner, this will most likely be a fate worse than death.\n\nWhat do you lovely people think?",
