        "text": "Hey Reddit,\n\nThis summer, firefighters in California have been risking their lives battling the worst wildfire in the state’s history. And in the midst of this emergency, Verizon was [just caught](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/verizon-throttled-fire-departments-unlimited-data-during-calif-wildfire/) throttling their Internet connections, endangering public safety just to make a few extra bucks.\n\nThis is incredibly dangerous, and shows why big Internet service providers can’t be trusted to control what we see and do online. This is exactly the kind of abuse we warned about when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to end net neutrality.\n\nTo push back, we’ve organized an open letter from first responders asking Congress to restore federal net neutrality rules and other key protections that were lost when the FCC voted to repeal the 2015 *Open Internet Order.* **[If you’re a first responder, please add your name here.](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/first-responders-demand-real-net-neutrality-protections/)** \n\nIn California, the state legislature is considering a state-level net neutrality bill known as Senate Bill 822 (SB822) that would restore strong protections. Ask your [assemblymembers to support SB822 using the tools here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/california/). California lawmakers are also holding a hearing [TODAY](https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/08/23/california-state-assembly-plans-hearing-on-verizon-throttling-of-firefighters-data/) on Verizon’s throttling in the Select Committee on Natural Disaster Response, Recovery and Rebuilding.\n\nWe are firefighters, net neutrality experts and digital rights advocates here to answer your questions about net neutrality, so ask us anything! We'll be answering your questions from 10:30am PT till about 1:30pm PT.\n\nWho we are:\n\n* Adam Cosner (California Professional Firefighters) - /u/AdamCosner\n* Laila Abdelaziz (Campaigner at Fight for the Future) - /u/labdel\n* Ernesto Falcon (Legislative Counsel at Electronic Frontier Foundation) - /u/EFFfalcon\n* Harold Feld (Senior VP at Public Knowledge) - /u/HaroldFeld\n* Mark Stanley (Director of Communications and Operations at Demand Progress) - /u/MarkStanley\n* Josh Tabish (Tech Exchange Fellow at Fight for the Future) - /u/jdtabish\n\n---\n\nNo matter where you live, head over to [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) or call (202) 759-7766 to take action and tell your Representatives in Congress to support the net neutrality Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution, which if passed would overturn the repeal. The CRA resolution has already passed in the Senate. Now, we need 218 representatives to sign the discharge petition (177 have already [signed](http://clerk.house.gov/115/lrc/pd/petitions/DisPet0011.xml) it) to force a vote on the measure in the House where congressional leadership is blocking it from advancing.\n\n[Proof.](https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/1033009545088389121)\n\n---\n\nUPDATE: So, why should this be considered a net neutrality issue? TL;DR: The repealed 2015 Open Internet Order could have prevented fiascos like what happened with Verizon's throttling of the Santa Clara County fire department. More info: [here](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/verizon-couldn-t-have-restricted-santa-clara-county-s-phone-ncna903531) and [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/08/verizons-throttling-fire-fighters-could-go-unpunished-because-fcc-repealed-open).",

        "text": "EDIT: The AMA has concluded! Thank you for all the great questions and we are looking forward to seeing some of you in our beta program next week!\n\n### What is Gladius?\n[Gladius](www.gladius.io) is the decentralized solution to protect against DDoS attacks by allowing individuals to join geographically relevant protection groups and contribute to website security and load speeds, all while earning money for it. With an easy to use interface as well as powerful insight tools, Gladius enables anyone to protect and accelerate their web application. Powered by the Ethereum blockchain, we are able to create a trustless network where every network message can be privately verified. We're headquartered in Washington D.C. with a branch in New York City.\n\n### What is Gladius up to?\nAfter months of closed beta testing in 66 countries, we are releasing our first open beta early next week! You will be able to download our software for free and start earning Gladius Tokens. To learn about how you get involved, join our Telegram chat [here](t.me/gladiusio). Also be sure to go to our [website](www.gladius.io) and subscribe to get notified when we go live! (Our new website will be up the day we launch)\n\n### What is DDoS and why are we the best solution?\nDDoS stands for Distributed Denial of Service. A DDoS attack focuses on overloading the available\nresources of a given site, datacenter, or application. By sending too much traffic or even junk traffic at a web application, an attacker can overload the system, which in turn prevents it from working properly. These types of attacks are usually carried out as diversionary tactics but can also be used to send a statement. \n\nWebsites sitting behind CDN (Content Distribution Network) networks gain the advantage of distribution. The more places the content exists, the less likely a single outage or DDoS attack can take that content down. Layering this protection in front of proxy nodes, which act a distributed firewalls, and Master nodes, which can do deep packet inspection and regex filtering, can filter down or eliminate vulnerabilities associated with advanced persistent threat vectors. All combined, a website sitting behind a CDN network and secured behind multiple layers creates \"Defense in Depth\" and gives the content owners an advantage over malicious actors.\n\nCurrent CDNs are centralized. DDoS mitigation is centralized, overpriced or requires far too much infrastructure. Data centers are hard to secure and are static and migration is hard in case of failure. Gladius believes we can improve on current DDoS and CDN offerings by reducing costs substantially by reducing overhead and spreading out costs amongst thousands or even millions of nodes.\n\n### Who are we?\nMax Niebylski - Founder, CEO\n\nAlex Godwin - Co-Founder, CTO, Networking Software Engineer\n\nMarcelo McAndrew - Co-Founder, COO, Web/Blockchain Software Engineer\n\nNathan Grey - Web/Blockchain Software Engineer\n\nStuart McDonald - Networking Software Engineer\n\nPatrick McMichael - Sales Engineer\n\nNicholas Zaslavsky - Social Director\n\n\n### Proof:\nhttps://twitter.com/gladiusIO/status/1032994135039528960\n\n### Learn more about Gladius:\nWebsite: https://gladius.io/\n\nSubreddit: https://reddit.com/r/gladiusnetwork\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/gladiusIO\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/gladiusio/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gladiusio/?hl=en\n\nCommunity Telegram: https://t.me/gladiusio\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I’m Ryan Nakashima, Technology Writer for The Associated Press in San Francisco, and I’ve been breaking news about how Google tracks your location on Android devices and iPhones -- sometimes even when you tell it not to. [Our first story on the topic](https://apnews.com/828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb) caused widespread outrage and alarm that a setting meant to prevent Google from recording your movements doesn’t work. We [outlined some best practices to minimize location tracking](https://apnews.com/b031ee35d4534f548e43b7575f4ab494). Then, we were first to [report that Google had changed its description of the setting to match what it was doing in the background](https://apnews.com/ef95c6a91eeb4d8e9dda9cad887bf211 ). A privacy group now says the Federal Trade Commission should investigate Google, arguing it broke a 20-year monitoring regime it agreed to in 2011 in which it [promised not to misrepresent its privacy promises to consumers.](https://apnews.com/c27d9e7b10e24a679b02472325b3fcec )\n\nI write about artificial intelligence and big technology companies, but mainly Google. That means digging into the intersection of big data, privacy, competition and ethics. I was also a John S. Knight Journalism Fellow at Stanford in 2016-17 studying the trade-off between advertising and subscriber support for the news media. I live in the Bay Area with my wife and three kids. \n\nProof: https://twitter.com/rnakashi/status/1031639044185190400\n\nUPDATE: We’re out of time, but really appreciate the great questions everyone submitted. I’ve enjoyed answering as well as I can. Please follow our coverage of technology news at https://apnews.com/tag/apf-technology; you can all keep track of what I’m up to by following me on Twitter at https://twitter.com/rnakashi ",

I’m Martin Myers, the author of the new book The NeverMind of Brian Hildebrand from Crowsnest Books. Now, when I say I’m the author, that’s not exactly factual. Brian Hildebrand is the true author and I’m merely writing his story as he is unable to do so. You see, Brian is in a permanent vegetative state (PVS) after being run over by his own car. Grim, right?\n\nBut Brian’s story is a comic one, and he is not the vegetable he is deemed to be. Unbeknownst to his caregivers, Brian is fully conscious, fully cognitive, fully aware, and, inexplicably, smarter than ever. A prisoner in his own frenetic brain, he has morphed into a polymath and multi-dimensional thinker, and is, somehow, able to tell his off-the-wall story as it veers tale-twistingly and mind-bendingly from the haunting to the hilarious, abetted by a far-out cast of characters, possibly of his own creation, possibly not.\n\nHow I wrote Brian’s story is not something he has authorized me to reveal. But, award-winning author Terry Fallis is thankful I did because he has said “this is quite an extraordinary novel that few writers could have written.”\n\nIf you have any questions about Brian, my research on coma patients, writing metafiction, or even what it’s like to be still writing at my age, I’ll be here from 1-3 pm EST today to answer them.\n\nProof: https://twitter.com/crowsnestbooks/status/1032289062923595776",

I may still be able to pop in and answer a question or two, but if you are interested and want to learn more about this stuff, I will be posting blogs and youtube videos on my facebook page. You can find me here:[https://www.facebook.com/rebeccanewkirklcsw/?ref=aymt\\_homepage\\_panel](https://www.facebook.com/rebeccanewkirklcsw/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel)\n\nA lot of people have asked for book recommendations so here are some great authors to look into: John Bradshaw, Jon Kabat-Zinn, Diana Fosha, Bessel van der Kolk, John Gottman (for relationship stuff).\n\nIf you are not in New Mexico or Virginia, but are interested in looking into therapy, Psychology Today is a great place to find therapists in your area.

I'll be checking back in over the next few days to answer more questions, so feel free to continue asking. I'll talk to you all soon!\\*\\*\\*\n\n​\n\nHi Reddit! I’m Rebecca Newkirk. I graduated with my Master's of  Social Work in 2012. I specialize in helping teens and young adults work  through their trauma and shame, so they can start to feel excited about  their futures. My work is infused with humor (which I believe is  essential to get through the hard stuff). I'm very transparent and  honest with my clients, which I believe is necessary when working with  those who have trauma so they can re-learn how to feel safe in  relationships (or at all). If you want to nerd out with me about the  techniques I use here are a few of my favorites: mindfulness, Gestalt,  and Internal Family Systems. If you don't want to nerd out, suffice it  to say I like to help people go back to the root of their issues so they  can feel better now. \n\nPerfectionism  may seem like a non-issue to some of you, but it can be debilitating.  The need to do everything perfectly can stop us from doing things that  are important to us because we’re afraid we won’t perform them  flawlessly. \n\nMy proof: \n\n[https://www.facebook.com/rebeccanewkirklcsw/photos/a.423113948180612.1073741829.396596170832390/423152711510069/?type=3&amp;theater](https://www.facebook.com/rebeccanewkirklcsw/photos/a.423113948180612.1073741829.396596170832390/423152711510069/?type=3&amp;theater)\n\nWhen  I’m not teaching classes at New Mexico Highlands University, or helping  teens and adults through the pain in their pasts so they can be excited  about their futures, I probably have my nose in a young adult fantasy  book, my hands wrapped around a barbell, or my arms around my new  daughter. (Yes, my username is an allusion to Dumbledore’s phoenix!) \n\nAsk me Anything about perfectionism, shame, trauma, or Harry Potter!DISCLAIMER I'm not able to provide counseling thru reddit.

        "text": "Hi Reddit!\n\n​\n\nWe are a team of scientists based in the Metabolic Research Laboratories, University of Cambridge. Our primary research focus is to understand the genetic and environmental factors influencing the function of white adipose tissue (fat). We think that appropriate function of fat tissue is central for human health. Impairments of fat tissue function cause nutrient deposition elsewhere in the body, leading to the development of type 2 diabetes, hearth disease and other related disorders.\n\n​\n\nCurrently, the diagnosis for type 2 diabetes is based on fasting blood glucose and oral glucose tolerance test. These factors indicate how well pancreas secrete insulin, and how well the glucose is taken up from the circulation in response to secreted insulin. Importantly, impairments in either of the processes is a sign of advanced metabolic disease, when clinical and lifestyle interventions are much less effective than early measures directed to prevent disease development.\n\n​\n\nWe have recently published a paper showing that mice with dysfunctional fat tissue exhibit normal glucose metabolism when they are young. However, they become much more insulin resistant when they get older compared to control mice. The impaired function of fat tissue in these mice at a young age cannot be identified using glucose tolerance test, but can be easily spotted after they eat too much of their regular food. We therefore think that a mixed nutrient tolerance test (in other words - a large meal) could identify individuals with impaired fat tissue function, and would encourage clinical or lifestyle interventions while their glucose metabolism is still normal.\n\n​\n\nAsk us anything related to the role of fat tissue, fat metabolism and nutrition, and we will do our best to answer your questions!\n\n​\n\nProof: [https://twitter.com/TVPLab](https://twitter.com/TVPLab)\n\nLink to the original research paper (Open access): [https://tinyurl.com/y7tmxyc4](https://tinyurl.com/y7tmxyc4)\n\nLink to the lay summary of the paper in 'The Conversation': [https://theconversation.com/diabetes-new-test-could-detect-the-disease-much-earlier-101409](https://theconversation.com/diabetes-new-test-could-detect-the-disease-much-earlier-101409)\n\nEdit1: Fixed the link to the paper.",

        "text": "Congress has never made a law saying, \"Corporations should get to decide who gets to publish truthful information about defects in their products,\"— and the First Amendment wouldn't allow such a law — but that hasn't stopped corporations from conjuring one out of thin air, and then defending it as though it was a natural right they'd had all along.\n\nBut in 1998, Bill Clinton and his Congress enacted the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), a giant, gnarly hairball of digital copyright law that included section 1201, which bans bypassing any \"technological measure\" that \"effectively controls access\" to copyrighted works, or \"traffic\\[ing\\]\" in devices or services that bypass digital locks.\n\nNotice that this does not ban disclosure of defects, including security disclosures! But decades later, corporate lawyers and federal prosecutors have constructed a body of legal precedents that twists this overbroad law into a rule that effectively gives corporations the power to decide who gets to tell the truth about flaws and bugs in their products.\n\nLikewise, businesses and prosecutors have used Section 1201 of the DMCA to attack researchers who exposed defects in software and hardware. Here's how that argument goes: \"We designed our products with a lock that you have to get around to discover the defects in our software. Since our software is copyrighted, that lock is an 'access control for a copyrighted work' and that means that your research is prohibited, and any publication you make explaining how to replicate your findings is illegal speech, because helping other people get around our locks is 'trafficking.'\"\n\nEFF has \\[sued the US government to overturn DMCA 1201\\]([https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-lawsuit-takes-dmca-section-1201-research-and-technology-restrictions-violate](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-lawsuit-takes-dmca-section-1201-research-and-technology-restrictions-violate)) and we \\[just asked the US Copyright Office\\]([https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/eff-vs-iot-drm-omg](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/eff-vs-iot-drm-omg)) to reassure security researchers that DMCA 1201 does not prevent them from telling the truth.\n\nWe are:\n\nCory Doctorow \\[u/doctorow\\]: Special Advisor to Electronic Frontier Foundation\n\nMitch Stoltz \\[/u/effmitch\\]: Senior Staff Attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation\n\nKyle Wiens \\[u/kwiens\\]: Founder of iFixit \\[[https://ifixit.com](https://ifixit.com)\\]\n\nNote!
