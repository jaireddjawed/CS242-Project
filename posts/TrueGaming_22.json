Several of these games are considered among the best of this generation. However, the only Japanese game considered one of the best of last generation that I can think of is Dark Souls. The rest were mostly Western games. So the question is, Why? Technology? Investment? Fluke? Or perhaps there is no renaissance and you think Japan did great last gen too?",

How do review companies just throw a 9 attached to a game like madden and call it a review? That's part of the reason these games get sold like hotcakes despite having little to no improvement since previous installations. \n\nIs there seriously a controversy going on? Does EA pay these websites to produce blatantly untrue and biased reviews? Am I missing something here? ",

Quick game of PUBG now and then when buddies are on, but that was about it. \n\nWell, I decided to reinstall Origin and my beloved Battlefield games today, for the first time in a year or two.\n\nSo, I started with BF4, and it went...*badly* to say the least. \n\nNot entirely unexpected though, I never did play *that* much of it, barely even know my way around any of the maps except for Shanghai and Locker I think, and Carrier SAssault is deader than dead (RIP), so..time for old faithful. BF3 and before that BF:BC2. Hundreds if not thousands of hours combined across both games, console and PC, both of those games pretty much equally blew my mind. Kinda why I never got into BF4 as much, I think, it was just more of the same but bigger and prettier, but BC2 and BF3 were mind-blowing to me after BF2.\n\nYeah, I'm fucking horrible at those too. Gave myself time to warm up, find the mouse sensitivity I like, try my favorite maps (still Firestorm and Caspian on BF3, Arica/White Pass BC2) get back into the vibe, etc. \n\nThe tactics are still fresh, map knowledge, everything..except what counts-the reaction time of my trigger finger. Without fail, I'm all \"Hmm, I think that *might* be an enem-..\" RIP me, over and over again, chainkilled almost, and my Squad rapidly empties and stays that way. Even just trying to be a concientous objector and save some lives and PTFO my ass off is having much worse results than even when I was a fresh private looking for his first shitbucket.\n\nSo are there any folks here my age who managed to stay sharp and deadly, or should I just play fucking Fortnite and hide form headshots by building silly nonsense? just kidding, I suck at that too\n\nAnd if anyone is willing to try this reaction time test and post your results with your age, it could be interesting: https://www.humanbenchmark.com/\n\n302.0ms here, 39th percentile..that's...not good, is it?\n\n",

So how much time do you give a specific game before deciding to give up on it? Do you have a hard cap you set for yourself, or does it change depending on the game/genre? If you've heard that a game takes some time to pick up steam and gets really good later, would you go beyond your typical limit given the good reviews?\n\nFor me, I've found that about 2-3 hours is the max I'm willing to offer to any game. I feel like that's a long enough time-frame for the game to show you what it has to offer, or at least a basic outline of the mechanics, story, characters etc. There are just too many games out there and I only have aroyund 3-4 hours of gaming time a week. If I haven't been grabbed in the first couple of hours, I'll most likely give that game a pass.\n\nWhat about you?",

        "text": "Whenever I used to get a new game, I would read articles, reviews, watch every possible video I could find; walkthroughs, let's play, tips and tricks, ...\n\nI wanted to get all the fun the game had to offer as quickly as possible: How do I get that super duper weapon in the first hour of the game? What's the best way to farm for x? Where is that super secret spot? How do I solve that puzzle?\n\nNow I understand that for some games, mainly multiplayer games and competitive games, this has become a standard for most players. Staying up to date with the meta, increasing performances by using pro players as examples, etc.\n\nBecause of the competitive nature of those game and the frustration that losing produces, it's totally understandable, because in those games, what's fun is also (mostly?) winning.\n\nBut I believe I'm spoiling the fun single player games have to offer by doing the same thing  (and allow me to assume I'm not the only one).\n\nThis came to mind recently. I started playing **No Man's Sky** a week ago and I'm forcing myself to not lookup anything (unless I'm stuck on a simple thing for way too long, then it becomes a chore and the frustration starts to settle in).  And I'm having loads and loads of fun. I sometimes cannot find what I want but then I start going through all the in-game menus (with the obvious ones first) and 99% of the time I find what I want. And it makes me feel good.\n\nDiscovering the mechanics of a game (most of them) is part of the fun if not most of the fun. I'd go as far as saying that once you've learned all of the mechanics a game has to give you, it starts getting boring, because then there's no novelty and it becomes stale. And then we want to start another game and get the fun out of that one too, quickly!\n\nStumbling upon an awesome weapon or armour (even if it's not the best one) is such an exciting moment.\n\nLooking up \"best bow for archer\" and directly starting that quest line for the reward surely provides immediate satisfaction, but the excitement and the sense of achievement are very much diminished by using this method.\n\nI remember the old times, when playing on my Playstation, being stuck somewhere and finally managing to do what I wanted to do or get what I wanted to get, it felt amazing. Even if sometimes it would be through sharing info with a friend during recess or a gaming magazine, you had to wait for it, you had to provide some effort. Now all you have to do is google what you want, it's there, done.\n\nSo far I still don't know exactly what I'm supposed to do in No Man's Sky (maybe this isn't the best example because it's a bit sandbox-y but this is my current experience), and I don't care, I'm having fun&gt;! just discovering, exploring, crafting, finding blueprints, farming, talking to aliens, flying around...!&lt;\n\nI'll try apply this to all the future games I start. I don't need all the fun immediately.\n\nTL:DR; Google spoils the fun of the games, it's about the journey, not the destination. Don't try to get there ASAP.\n\nEdit: even if we don't all agree with this, I'm glad I could start some sort of discussion :)",

I've never heard of a real success story in that group. It seems to me that indie games basically require either a solid single-player campaign or couch multi; you can add online to that, but it can't be the only thing.\n\nThe only exception I can think of is [Altitude](https://store.steampowered.com/app/41300/Altitude/), and that came out in 2009, long before the current indie glut. I'm not sure if MUDs and similar small-scale MMOs count, since they generally have lots of single-player content. Is there anything I'm missing?",

It’s a way for them to charge you the full amount of a game while outsourcing the legwork to the fans. Furthermore, it allows the developers to focus on features that are not necessary instead of fixing problems with the primary game mechanics. \n\nAn example of this is in Cities Skylines, where mods exist that enhance the user's experience with traffic management. Traffic as a game mechanic is so utterly broken in Cities Skylines that its a wonder that the game was able to be shipped at all: instead of focusing their efforts on fixing the traffic AI, Colossal decided to release DLC pack after DLC pack of miscellaneous add-on features, like being able to have a snowy city. \n\nBrowsing low-brow youtube comments or steam reviews you'd get the sense that most people do not agree with me. These comments don't often go into detail about why they feel that way however, so I'd like to ask all of you where you draw the line. Do you judge a game based on its potential with mods? When you recommend a game to somebody else, is it only with a certain modding experience involved? Is there a tacit conceit that we're playing *bad games* that fail at executing their primary game mechanics when we have to recommend a mod to someone so that the base experience isn't spoiled?\n\nDiscuss. \n",

Small, low quality white  with black details icons over a same-tone black background? It hurts my eyes a little even when wearing glasses, if I try to focus on the icons while scrolling.\n\n- Bethesda-style compass use over classic labeled minimap. The compass was never a perfect idea in the first place, even when decently implemented in Skyrim and, to a lesser degree; the recent Fallout games. \n\n- A bad mix up between a more visually minimalistic, more text based interface of old Elder Scrolls games, and the need for a more intuitive, icons based interface for a grindy, immersive MMO, á la Guild Wars 2.\n\n\nI'll edit as new ones pop up.

        "text": "Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that few 3D games are praised for having challenging yet enjoyable navigation. I see a lot of the best exploration-based games praised for making navigation easy through environmental design as opposed to \"crutches\" such as quest arrows and minimaps, but I don't see a lot of games where navigation is challenging yet considered a plus.\n\nI understand why designing around navigational challenge is exponentially more difficult in 3D than 2D. A top-down view of a maze is inherently easier than a behind-the-back third person view of a maze. This is because in most 2D games, you just have a much wider view of the environment around your character, but in third-person 3D games, all you can generally see is what's in front of your character.\n\nAs such, most games that I have seen posing navigational challenge are either top-down or side-scrolling 2D games. Games like Alundra and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night stand as great examples how to challenge you with navigation in 2D, and the indie space continues that legacy with games like Hyper Light Drifter and Hollow Knight.\n\nBut for 3D games, I can't think of much games that promote navigational challenge. Off the top of my head though, I can come up with Captain Toad. Captain Toad gives its levels a sense of navigational challenge by making them small, but you need to look at the level from different angles using the camera. Thus, the challenge with Captain Toad's navigation is to overcome obstacles from different viewpoints, and each viewpoint reveals different information while obscuring other information.\n\nSo it seems that part of the solution to making spaces difficult yet fun to navigate is to somehow obscure the overall layout of the area so that you can't figure everything out with just a cursory glance. So are there other keys to making navigation challenging yet fun?",

It’s me again. \n\nWhile pondering a few ideas for a Webtoons comic, I also wanted to test out the water to see what kind of indie game my fellow gamers would be most interested in for this next generation of consoles and computers. Keep in mind, these are all just raw concepts, and are subject to change over the years. I’m mostly listing the basic mechanics and some thematic elements as well. There will also be a poll underneath from which you can pick one or multiple concepts that appeal to you, or even if you’d want to voice some ideas of your own. \n\nI understand that some people might find this to be jumping the gun a bit, but I wouldn’t want to be going full throttle into any of these concepts only to find that after years of development, nobody would even WANT to play the game I’d be working on. So yes, it’s a bit raw, but I am more than willing to cook up a well done experience if I’m given the right direction. Any and all feedback is welcome, thank you.\n\nSo here are the concepts that I have in mind so far: \n\nThorn, Dark Fantasy Open World RPG. Traverse a perilous open world with multiple pathways and obscure worlds fused together by a dark curse. Throughout this vast world, you have but one save point: a giant black thorn that can be summoned from anywhere, and from which you are respawned once you are killed. After absorbing wayward souls to join you party, you are capable of switching between party members in real time to help explore the world map in new ways and discover new pathways. Fend against enemies and bosses with multiple combinations of attacks via the members of your party and their versatile options of weaponry to be upgraded as you see fit. (Influences: Demon’s Souls, Undungeon, Hyper Light Drifter, Indivisible, Transistor)\n\nSoiron, Cooking World Action RPG. To find an antidote for the mass plague spreading across the land, solve ominous food-themed puzzles in the overworld while fending against zombie-like enemies via a secluded iron chef themed battle field. Harvest ingredients across the world to whip together a dish powerful enough to lay your enemies to rest. Party members, functioning as your sous chefs, help you locate special herbs and spices within the battle zone while discovering which combination of spices will help destroy your enemies, as well as bosses with some strange tastes and even stranger weak points. (Influences: Battle Chef Brigade, League of Legends, Pyre, Saltenpepper)\n\nRide4Life, Cyberpunk Racing RPG. Traverse through a perilous and mesmerizing futuristic world on the brink of collapse via multiple forms of gameplay, including maddening track racing, sumo-esque vehicular combat, and open world exploration. As your road grows longer, your bond with your car grows stronger, along with the spirit medium of your vehicle as well. Stronger bonds allow for more slots to upgrade and swap out vehicle parts for enhanced combat and maneuvering. In terms of a party system, there’s the addition of interchangeable copilots for different attacks and buffs, along with enhanced character interactions. (Influences: Mario Kart, Shadowrun, Banjo Kazooie Nuts N Bolts, REDLINE)\n\nKiton’s Keep, Underground Side Scroller RPG. When a mystic castle filled with strange magic and riches is revealed to be buried whole beneath a great mountain, you set out to traverse the dark halls with naught but your faithful grappling hook. Along the way, you may encounter fellow explorers, several of whom could trade riches with you or give you special upgrades to your gun for offensive and defensive abilities. The further towards the keep you get, the more violent your adversaries and the more obscure your sense of direction becomes; all you can rely on is your safety line to your trusty airship, your ever-floating hub of the game. (Influences: Sperlunky, Bastion, La Mulana, Salt and Sanctuary)\n\nWings of Blight, Bug Kingdom Turn Based RPG. A Bee Knight with a clipped antennae sets out to remedy the blight that is killing the forest home of her people, despite being exiled by them. Fend off agains the vile and insane alike within the insect kingdom with the help of some strange bug companions that come your way with each region of the forest you explore. With the aid of action commands and an intricate initiative bar below the screen, players can execute special attacks with various button combinations to constantly be kept on their toes. Gameplay outside of combat also aims to be rewarding, with a sprawling overworld loaded grand puzzles and quests to help build the world of this stranded bee, her whimsical party, and her crumbling home. (Influences: Paper Mario, Child of Light, Dragon Quest, Hollow Knight)\n\nDominus, Animal Kingdom Tactical RPG. Having been resurrected after the betrayal of your former commander, you must succeed him as the leader of a legion bent on world conquest. Recruit diplomats to assist you and open up a plethora of options to conquer your enemies, harvest your resources and reap greater riches. Fend against powerful adversaries either through diplomacy, bribery, or if necessary brute force. Gameplay systems transition smoothly between an isometric exploration mode and a map-based campaign mode, both featuring multiple options for communication and combat. (Influences: Tyranny, Fallout New Vegas, Dragon Age Inquisition, Tooth and Tail)\n\nAgain, thanks very much for taking a few minutes of your time to humor me and my ideas. Any and all feedback is most welcome and will be of great assistance in helping me flesh out something I can enjoy working on and hopefully create for you guys to enjoy as well :) \n\nhttps://www.strawpoll.me/16188879\n",

For my masters dissertation, I require participants to download and play the game I made and complete a series of questionnaires.\n\nThe proceedings of the experiment and additional information is available at\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc25BLZ7l3oaILmyK4Ob\\_3xO7W239Snq7MzFcuQTRWtR7\\_8kQ/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc25BLZ7l3oaILmyK4Ob_3xO7W239Snq7MzFcuQTRWtR7_8kQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\nIn short, I'm investigating if the introduction of GM-like functionality improves player experience in an open-world type environment. Very abstractly this means that NPC would generate quests for players to accomplish their needs, however should players ignore the quests. The NPC would try and accomplish the quests themselves. (note: these quests would not be the story driving quests, but the more mundane \"kill 5 X\" or \"gather 20 of Y\".) This would also mean that the player experience for each player (in a multiplayer) or for each play-through (in a single player) is more unique as not all NPC's will have the same quests available each time you pass them during the course of the game.\n\nif you have any questions regarding the experiment or game, feel free to send me a PM or mail me at [js17798@essex.ac.uk](mailto:js17798@essex.ac.uk).\n\nRegards,\n\nJelte",

The Elder Scrolls series is notable for this as is Tolkien and various other fantasy world and I know there are many arguments as to why this is the case, such as the existence of magic preventing the need for advancement, I still find it a little bit odd.But I recently recalled the Fable series and it occurred to me that while Fable 1 is set in a world that is medieval-esque, by Fable 2 things had progressed with things like guns and steam powered vehicles. Once we reach Fable 3 the world of Albion seems to be undergoing its industrial revolution, the main city of Bowerstone is now filled with factories causing pollution and poverty. \n\nThere are many things wrong with the Fable series but there are many things that I find extremely cool as well and this is one of them. \n",

        "text": "Grand Theft Auto V is a monster of a game and by most metrics can be considered a masterpiece. The complexity and detail of its open world and the seamlessness of its mechanics converge to deliver one of, if not the greatest open world experiences in a market saturated by open worlds still taking cues off of Rockstar’s previous efforts. It truly is a phenomenal representation of what is possible in this medium and a milestone for how far we have come. I recently replayed the entirety of GTAV’s campaign, and while I undeniably had a great time, I was more than a little disappointed at the game’s narrative and the wasted potential of having 3 playable protagonists. \n\n\nTo put it bluntly, GTA V’s story is garbage. The story has good writing, and the world surrounding the story is impeccably created, but the narrative itself is so poorly constructed, I am genuinely surprised this is what we finally got. Character motivations are initially explored, albeit simplistically, when we are introduced to Michael, Franklin, and Trevor, but these motivations fly out the door for nearly every major mission. The story at large essentially boils down to “We have to do this for the FIB and we won’t get paid”.  The story has no real villains, just assholes that order you around. Additionally, the secondary characters for Trevor and Franklin all but disappear about 2/3 of the way through the game for no reason. Franklin in particular has almost no characterization other than “I don’t want to do hood shit.”\n\n\nGTA IV’s story had its own problems, but despite of all its issues I loved it. Niko was a compelling character with flaws and traits that felt true. It had a phenomenal villain that motivated you beyond just cash and cars. \n\n\nThe worst of it all, in my eyes, is how the potential of having 3 playable protagonists was squandered. When this mechanic was announced I thought we would get an intricate overlapping of several perspectives, perhaps viewing the morality of a particular event through different lenses. What we got, instead feels like it’s Elmer’s glue/\n\n\nAt the end of the day I still adore GTA V. I think it is the quintessential open world game and its level of detail still amazes me to this day. Unfortunately, I think the narrative is a tremendous sore spot and a huge step down from every other game in the series.\n",

As developer myself I'm kinda sensitive of lousy UI decisions...\n\nfirst of, who could ever think that mouse click is not good enough and you need to click the button and then keep that button pressed for some time to actually activate the button...\nI have been clicking on buttons for 20 years, now some \"visionary\" developer decided that maybe after I click any button I need 1 second grace period in case I decide I don't want it clicked after all... I just hate it.\n\nanother thing that I really hate is when game forces you to restart itself when you change video settings... there are games that can hot reload anything and never need to restart. why some games can't even change resolution without restarting whole game (which by the way won't allow you to access those settings before you sit thru whole loading and intro)...\n\nI guess most games are created primarily to be played on console or at least with console controller, but would it be so hard to hire one guy, just one guy that actually ever player any game on computer with mouse and keyboard and let him test the controls and UI.\n\nmaybe microsoft or steam should enforce some guidelines because right now something like UX in gaming industry is complete wild west... something that is so crucial in web development and companies have whole UX teams on payroll is nearly nonexistent in game development.\n\nanother example that comes to my mind is Prey, I loved the idea of in game computers that are accessible by player and can be interacted similarly to real life computers. except that your mouse (which, on windows version, I control with mouse) left clicks with F key... I can't even count how many times I fired my weapon into computer in stead of clicking UI button :D",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/93alk7/simulation_games_and_the_life_as_a_game_question/",
        "text": "One thing that I find interesting is that simulation games, games designed around simulating a real-life activity (that is to say, a real-life activity which doesn't have its own genre, such as racing games), are often rather popular. Games that are about doing an actual job are somehow enjoyable by many, and even considered relaxing, even though doing such things IRL would be stressful.\n\nNow, it's true that many games are built around things which would be stressful if done IRL, but those are typically action games, designed to grab your attention and focus, using strategy and skill to get you through it. But simulation games typically don't have that.\n\nTake Stardew Valley. The game has several different activities you can do at any given time: farming, mining, foraging, and fishing. However, farming and foraging are not particularly exciting, and the average player is going to spend a lot of time foraging and farming than mining and fishing. The game's standard gameplay style just involves clicking on things to get items, and then using those items to either gain ingame currency or craft new, more useful items. There's nothing inherently active to grab your attention, and yet Stardew Valley is one of the most popular games on Steam.\n\nOr take Euro Truck Simulator, a video game about being a semi-truck driver in Europe. That is a real job people hold, and is considered very monotonous IRL, and yet playing it as a video game isn't.\n\nOr take Animal Crossing, which is all about talking with people and paying off debt, yet is a beloved franchise.\n\nI think there are two main reasons why simulation games are so enjoyable:\n\n1. Simulation games are not stressful. In real life, things like working and just living can be stressful. There's bills to pay, risks to avoid, and obligations to fulfill. In simulation games, those are no longer there. You can turn the game off, and suddenly any obligations the game gives you (if any) will wait until you're ready to deal with them. And furthermore, your ingame obligations are typically very clear-cut, typically revolving around a certain amount of money you need to pay or a certain number of items you need to gather. Real-life obligations are almost never that simple.\n\n2. Simulation games are designed to be fair. For example, in Stardew Valley, you can literally make money by walking around and gathering wild vegetables and flowers. You just plonk them down in your shipping box, and by the next day you get cold hard cash. There's always a way to reach your obligations in the game, and those methods are typically either simple or varied to ensure you can do whatever you want. You will never be trapped in a no-win situation, and any time you *do* fail, you can just try again.\n\nSo, in summary, simulation games are effectively what we want life to be life. They're cathartic because they take all the stress out of real-life situations, and make things less unfair.",

        "text": "I won't go into the negatives surrounding microtransactions as I think it's been done to death and I would assume most posters here are fully aware of the arguments. I've never spent a penny on microtransactions. This is more a personal post on how I choose to deal with the current gaming zeitgeist.\n\nMy first encounter with microtransactions was when they were introduced to TF2. I enjoyed playing the game a lot and liked the class updates they were doing in the early days. Then came the hats. I knew something wasn't right and I argued about it a lot on several forums. I said the game was going to change drastically because of this and not in a good way but I was met with a lot of typical dismissive comments, 'How could hats be bad, they don't do anything?' 'They're free, why do you care?' Sure enough, soon after hats came the marketplace, and soon after that more and more alternative weapons were introduced, and finally, the death knell, free-to-play. It didn't take long for the quality of the game to plummet and I gave it up never to return.\n\nThe whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth but I didn't quit games with microtransactions and I was still open to playing free-to-play games. I'm not sure what I was thinking at this time, I guess I just wanted to have good gaming experiences and I was open to what might still be out there regardless of the business model of the game. However, years have passed and I've watched too many games with microtransactions either come out as pure cash grabs or diminish in quality significantly as time goes on. I can't do it to myself any more so I have to change the way I'm playing games.\n\nSo this is where I'm at, I swear I won't play any more games with microtransactions. To clarify exactly what I mean, firstly the most important thing is I will not play any more free-to-play games any more, a game must have a paid base version. Given this, I don't mind if a game has a handful of cosmetic items that are obviously not a pure cash grab, this will be up to me to decide myself, but in my experience it's usually extremely transparent if the developer is building their business model around this as opposed to just offering uber fans a chance to invest a little bit more in a game they really enjoy. Extra paid content such as maps/levels/scenarios/game modes are fine. Extra paid weapons are OK in single-player games but not in multiplayer games where they can be a difference-maker. Any game that features loot boxes or any similar concept are automatic dismissals.\n\nI don't care if all of my friends are playing Fortnite and FIFA, I won't do it.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/930vet/the_i_in_team_octopath_traveler_diegetical/",
        "text": "There is a trite, played out joke often made about musicals: \"How did all these characters know all the words to these songs?\"\n\nOctopath Traveler is a solid game, despite whatever I’m about to say about it.  If you own the Nintendo Switch and ever enjoyed a classic RPG, then I cannot stress how badly you need to give this experience some quality time.  It's a callback to the glory days of Super Nintendo RPGs, conjuring up nostalgic memories of afternoons squatted on the floor grinding out another dungeon in Final Fantasy VI or trying a new team composition in Chrono Trigger to unlock new Tech.  The gorgeous, mouth watering visuals, the swelling music, the tight combat that promotes strategic thinking and resource management; it's all here swirling together to create a potent experience.\n\nHowever, if all these things are true, why do I have a nagging feeling that I won't remember a lick about this game a decade from now, let alone this time next year?  What is the thing missing from my gushing paragraph above, one of the core materials of a strong roleplaying experience that lodges itself in that nostalgic place in your heart?\n\nIt's the story.\n\nFor a game whose major gimmick is the ability to play through eight unique plotlines following eight characters, the execution of this core premise is the weakest link in an otherwise iron-wrought chain.  By the time I had reached the sixth story, I found my eyes glazing over and skimming over writing of wildly disparate quality as I barreled with anticipation towards the next strategic boss encounter.\n\nBut what makes Octopath’s approach to storytelling so ineffectual?  It has much less to do with the stories that are being told, but more HOW they are being told within the chosen media of video games.\n\nThere was much ado made several years ago over the idea of \"ludonarrative dissonance\", a term coined by Ubisoft creative director Clint Hocking that made the rounds in the wake of the Bioshock series of games.  Used to describe story elements of a game that are thematically disassociated with the actions the player performs whilst engaging with the game, as if story and gameplay are two different camps that do not overlap.  Bioshock’s story encourages the player to do good, but this is posited in stark contrast to the gruesome violence that makes up the gameplay sections.  This criticism was also leveled at Naughty Dog’s Uncharted series, but was notably absent from the studio’s followup The Last of Us, most likely due to the grim world depicted therein more readily lending itself to these wanton acts of violence both in gameplay and story.\n\nSome of the early reviews of Octopath Traveler accused the game of suffering from ludonarrative dissonance as well, and there is merit to this.  A party of four warriors that have sparred with literal gods to absorb their powers cannot find it in themselves to avoid capture at the hands of untrained farmhand townspeople.  This has been a staple of RPG storytelling since their inception though, and it is easy to give it a pass simply because it has almost become the norm.  There is, however, a far bigger narrative fault holding back the writing of this game, and it's all due to the title's namesake; the eight storylines.\n\nMost musicals can be divided up into two elements; the story and the songs.  In The Beauty and the Beast, Belle leaves her home and wanders through her small provincial town in the French countryside and a musical number plays.  She has conversations, sings to animals, and plot elements HAPPEN, but is the song itself canonical?  Where does the reality of the musical begin and end?  To answer the question posed at the beginning: \"How did all these characters know all the words to these songs,\" we have to turn to diegesis, a storytelling concept extant since the days of Plato.\n\nAnything that happens with the literal world of a piece of media is called \"diegetic\".  In a James Bond film, a gunfight would be diegetic.  A song in Beauty and the Beast, or the riveting score that plays while Bond chases a criminal, isn't really happening IN the world the story is taking place in.  The music is an external addition by the filmmakers.  Bond cannot hear the music, because it isn't REALLY there for him.  That score is non-diegetic.  Obviously there are exceptions to this rule, such as the performance numbers in musicals such as Moulin Rouge or Chicago.  Going back to Beauty and the Beast, it could be argued that Be Our Guest is a diegetic song as it is portrayed as a performance by the castle staff.  Notable film directors like Mel Brooks have played around with these concepts in films like High Anxiety.  \n\nOctopath Traveler suffers from a wild inability to distinguish to the player what actions are and are not happening; the diegetic and non-diegetic elements of the game blurring together into a mush that makes it hard to react properly to the stories the game wants to tell.  Octopath is much more akin to the film adaptation of The Phantom of the Opera, where the diegetic ambiguity makes it very difficult to tell what is real and what isn’t.\n\nThe player has the option of recruiting up to eight playable characters, each with their own hopes, dreams, motivations, and plotline.  You can mix and match these party members at will to find a team that suits you the best, or you could opt to only recruit two or three members, or perhaps six.  The developers are on record as wanting the player to interact with their game in whatever manner they choose.  Unfortunately, this makes it impossible to write eight stories that weave together into a rich story tapestry.  A writer can't incorporate one character into another's story if a player decides they didn't feel like unlocking a character, or maybe benched them after not being able to find a niche for them in their lineup.  The premise gimps the execution.  Imagine a Game of Thrones where none of the characters ever interacted with each other; a rich world with elaborate backstories and fleshed out locations, with characters just going from town to town but never encountering each other.  It's hard to build real drama like this.\n\nUnfortunately, Octopath Traveler’s solution to this problem is to ignore it. The player might enter a story cutscene with four team members and the three that are not a part of the storyline at hand disappear, culled from existence until the cutscene finishes.  The lines of reality blur further when those characters reappear for a miniboss battle and pop back out of the world a moment later.  Is their presence diegetic?  Do they really exist, or are they the Belle to the game's Beauty and the Beast?\n\nUnfortunately, it gets even harder to answer these questions.  Occasionally the player will be given the opportunity to listen to \"party banter\", the only time the different characters will muse amongst each other about the plotline at hand.  Clearly, these characters were all present and witnessed the events as they unfolded... but then why didn't they intervene?  There were two particularly grevious scenes where a single hero was caught in a trap in which they were heavily outnumbered, but there was no way that the entire party could have been caught in that same trap.  It wouldn't be physically possible if the team's presence were diegetic, but it's impossible to tell what is real and what is not in this game.  An entire chapter is spent building up tension towards a gladiatorial duel in an arena; a one-on-one fight to crown a champion as two men square off in the sand to test their mettle.  Then the cutscene ends and it's a 4v4 brawl.  All the tension and buildup went out the window.\n\nIt seems like such a small complaint, but I cannot think of many RPGs going back that fail at this core idea so profoundly.  Final Fantasy VII had “secret” optional characters in the form of Vincent and Yuffie, but aside from the ending cinematics, they are present and legitimate members of the players’ team from the moment that they are recruited.  Combat in lots of RPGs utilizing random encounters could potentially be considered non-diegetic; did the player really slaughter five hundred security guards as they worked my way up Shinra tower?  It’s hard to say and most RPGs gloss over this concept.  It’s a conceit of working in the medium.\n\nIt would be easier to give these games a pass if the solution had not been found and executed masterfully decades ago.  Chrono Trigger for the Super Nintendo expertly addressed any diegetical issues by removing the transition to a separate “combat” screen.  By grounding every encounter in the game’s world they removed all diegetic ambiguity.  The iconic dungeon escape scene is a grand example.  The stakes are set for the player and they must be overcome in very literal terms. \n\nThe story unfortunately suffers from other things than just diegetic ambiguity.  The wildly disparate quality of the writing between the different characters is legitimately surprising, seeing as how most of the tales are variations on the same theme of \"Why do I do X,\" the fill-in-the-blank being whatever party function the character in question fills.  Over the course of each character's four chapters, the player wades through some pretty horrible dialogue and melodramatic monologues as each character went through the same 4-act highs and lows on a journey of self-discovery with the only real variation being the degree to which the stakes had been raised.  It's hard to really get invested in the story of a little girl who just wants to see the world and watch her walk into some pretty blatant traps after coming away from a plotline that sees a theft evolve into murders and a doomsday plot.  The desire to create a story that avoids tropes is admirable and while a simple story might succeed at avoiding cliche, if it's not at the very least interesting, then what's the point?\n\nI could go on and talk about the pacing pitfalls incurred by splitting the story into unconnected chapters, or how hiding the grand finale that attempts to tie the eight stories together at the end behind optional, uninspired side quests with little direction robs the player of a potential payoff, but honestly I’d just be beating the proverbial dead horse.  I’ve made my point quite clearly that I am not impressed with the writing of Octopath Traveler.  It’s passable and provides an adequate vehicle to guide the player towards the next encounter, but it won’t go down in history as an iconic RPG that defined the genre.\n\nAll of the game’s issues are a manifestation of the inherent pitfalls of open-world games.  Designers have to maintain a precarious balance of player freedom and (if they want) story development.  The more freedom they allot the player, the more nebulous the story must be in order to accommodate that freedom.  The more linear and rigid a game’s story is, the more freedom the developers have to craft a tight, character driven plot.\n\nBethesda’s Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and CDProjektRed’s Witcher III are two shining examples of this duality.  Skyrim touts a huge world to explore with a character you create from scratch.  Go anywhere, do anything.  Witcher III casts the player in the role of Geralt, with a huge world to explore but considerably less freedom of character.  The player can steer Geralt’s personality through dialogue options, but at the end of the day he is still Geralt.\n\nThe pitfall of Skyrim (and similarly, other Bethesda titles) is that video games are a medium limited by technology, and the time constraints of the developers.  You can go anywhere and do anything… as long as those things you want to do are on a list of things the developers were able to program into the game.  The player might opt to run a virtuous character OR a murderous villain, dialogue and plotlines must be written to accommodate both of these.  Any number of variables can change how a story plays out, and at the end of the day depth of writing must be sacrificed in order to release a product.  In Skyrim’s case, a player could become the High King AND the leader of the Dark Brotherhood of Assassins in a single playthrough, but these storylines do not overlap and have to be kept at arms length due to the limitations of the medium.\n\nThe Witcher III, by opting to limit the player to a single character, is able to write deeper character driven stories.  The player isn’t capable of playing Geralt however they choose to, but can steer him towards different archetypes.  Geralt could be virtuous, mercenary, dispassionate, but he won’t be found traveling town to town and murdering all the citizens in blood soaked glee.  The player has to sacrifice the freedom to be whoever they want and craft a customized adventure for themselves in exchange for better written characters that interact with each other in more intricate plots.\n\nThe results?  Witcher III is renowned for its tight storylines and intricately plotted dialogue trees and Skyrim is praised for its freedom to craft a character in whatever image you desire.  If video games were a color spectrum, Skyrim has every hue but no depth, while the Witcher only has a few colors but dozens of shades of each.  They’re both valid approaches that offer similar but ultimately completely different experiences that appeal to a wide demographic.\n\nOctopath Traveler’s problem was that it took the Skyrim approach, but advertised the Witcher.  It put its writing at the forefront of its advertisements and marketing strategy, when the gameplay and visuals are the real draw that keep the momentum going forward.\nAt the end of the day though, does any of that matter?  Despite the 2500 words preceding this that tear the writing to pieces, Octopath Traveler is still an INCREDIBLY fun game.  I wouldn’t take back any of my 60 hours, because I had such a blast exploring this game’s world.  All the GORGEOUS world direction and truly breathtaking sprite work had me enraptured, and it was all crowned with some of the most nail-biting boss encounters I’ve ever undertaken in a turn-based RPG.  Trying to go into the endgame content without an encyclopedic knowledge of the game’s systems and mechanics is a recipe for disaster, and the game has ample challenges for a player invested in its systems to show off their skills.  Octopath Traveler succeeds despite its gimmick.  After all, a good adventure isn’t about the destination; it’s about the Traveling you did to get there.",

If there's a platform it can be reached. But in a game like god of war or the last of us, it's different.

        "text": "Here is a video for reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICVHMOjKncU\n\nBeing a long-time Tom Clancy fan, you often expect a lot of story-driven narratives where some elements have their own sci-fi elements like Splinter Cell's near-future technology, combined with some real-life elements like for example The Division *(though technically a Tom Clancy game in terms of gameplay, mechanics or even story since it is not based off of a Tom Clancy novel and it has the Tom Clancy name)* is mostly based off of Operation Dark Winter, a mock simulation where the U.S. Government tested on how to be prepared in case an actual biological pandemic happened in the U.S.\n\nMost stories in the Tom Clancy series have some form of realism in it which is a part of its charm with the usual heroes-vs-villains type of story with a more mature or dark look and sometimes even a level of conspiracy involved like hunting down an underground criminal organisation, or stopping a worldwide terrorist attack or even stopping a conspiracy that could result in nuclear war or World War 3.\n\n(tbh, most Tom Clancy stories even started the whole cheesy action flick that most military movies and even video games like COD are known for today)\n\n*(and sometimes, there were often some shades of grey in terms of morality as some vilians had their own sympathetic motivations although they were also extreme too)*\n\nHowever, most of the enemies that the protagonists face were external threats like ultra-nationalist Russians or worldwide criminal organisations and so on.\n\nRainbow Six Patriots was promised to have a different look. The main antagonists, the True Patriots, although their motivations involved extremism, intimidation, terrorism and other illegal acts, they were domestic terrorists whose motivations were sympathetic because they felt that the U.S. was too corrupt and needed to be destroyed entirely.\n\nIt was a more politically-driven type of story with more politically complicated elements because the topic regarding U.S. politics and possible corruption and other shady practices was a very hot topic during that time and it still is today.\n\nEven though I would not have liked the idea of neglecting the tactics and strategy focused elements that Tom Clancy games are known for, this idea of a complex story with different perspectives whose neither good or bad was a brilliant idea.\n\nYes, of course people are going to take this too literally and will be personally affected by this \n\n*(I mean, come on. Have you seen how politics often meddles with video games and scapegoat them for pretty much anything? Have you seen how America reacts to anything involving the depiction of America in a bad light? It is almost hypocritical that it has a culture of involving freedom and yet, anything involving America in a bad light is often deemed as heretical)*\n\nYes, some far-right people would have probably taken the game too literally and think it was a propaganda to motivate people to become domestic terrorists. Yes, some legal action would have probably been involved *(as if domestic terrorism was somehow a new thing because many TV shows and films used this kind of story as a plot element)*\n\nBut man, this would have been a bold move for Ubisoft to publish this kind of story and probably spark endless discussions.\n\nFor many times we are often see America portrayed as the good guys and the heroes of the story.\n\nWhile true, its influence has changed the world in many ways, it is not a perfect country and this darker and perhaps more realistic portrayal of America and its complex culture, it would be a game that many people will talk about.\n\nJust like many people talk about the bold portrayals of characters and stories down right and done with proper intention and passion like Last of Us, God of War, Metal Gear, and so many other games that make gamers question their motives, their lives and their world around them, this game would also be an artistic expression about the world of today.\n\nNote that I am not saying that America is the bad guy and the portrayal of domestic terrorists is a done out of spite. Far from it.\n\nBut this type of portrayal is the portrayal that make people discuss more, question more, and even think critically about the world and even their own choices as the soldiers who has to make the tough choices and makes them more aware that in real-life, this complex interaction of warfare, terrorism, politics and culture, it is not a game. It is far more complex and maybe even way more mature and scarier than you might think.\n\nLike I said earlier- much like some developers took bold and passionate moves that portrayed characters in very believable and impactful manners, these games are the games of legend and the games will be remembered forever for their sheer artistic expression and how different they are from other games and how much that they will still be remembered how much effort was made to give those messages that they were meant to portray in most effective manner possible\n\n(Like Joel eventually has to be a ruthless survivor in the Last of Us while we also still mourn for his loss and the fact that he felt that he was becoming more human again since he met Ellie; or the portrayal of Big Boss and Solid Snake and how their actions in war, no more how noble they are, have a ton of negative effects on other areas in the world and while continuously progress that cycle of warfare; or the portrayal of Kratos in the latest of God of War game where Kratos must learn to face with own past while must teach his own son to not make the same mistakes that he did and teach him that the world is very cruel as well while his son teaches him how to be human again)",

        "text": "**Speech**, one of RPGs’ most notable feature which allows you to get out of fights, get more rewards, and more is something I recently started to realize is kinda... shallowly done. \n\nI feel with Speech , from my own experience, having not played or finished many RPGs, that it’s just too... straightforwarded and limiting? Like, usually it’s these generic dialogue choices but then there’s the Speech/Persuasion option which why would you ever not pick that option? :b\n\nContrast that with combat or even stuff like hacking, lockpocking, stealth. Those mechanics give you some form of freedom of movement. Combat you can move around and use a WIDE VARIETY of weapons and how you use them generally depends on your own skill and input. Hacking and so forth in games like Fallout are treated like puzzles, finding the right code or right spot (for lock picking) which I admittedly enjoy and yeah, they do feel more rewarding than hovering over the blatantly obvious ‘Well, Duh...’ Speech option, which really feels like no work or even thinking was accomplished.\n\nI think there’s two things you could do to make Speech more compelling and perhaps challenging.\n\nOne, I think RPG dialogue systems could try and learn from games like [the Council with its skill-based branching dialogue system.](https://youtu.be/QEldooNZyx8#t=1m42s)\n\nThe second I think is something we probably won’t see for a long long time but actual intelligent AI responding to what you type. For the longest time we’ve had to select the written speech the writers chose for us but what if we could type whatever and the AI would respond in character? Of course this kind of AI is a decade or so away and there’s gonna probably be a limit to what the AI can respond to (and I’m sure people will initially try saying outrageous things and expecting the NPCs to respond to them.)\n\n The former is probably more practical in the foreseeable future so yeah, I really hope dialogue is treated more like how the Council does it because otherwise we’re kinda just stuck with the simple no-thinking-requires speech check\n\nThoughts and/or suggestions?\n\n",

        "text": "Believe me, I've been guilty of applying both to discussions. But the more I see everyone up to and including \"professional\" video game journalists and/or analysts do this as well, I mentally groan and tune out the discussion as it inevitably degenerates into an old vs new argument.\n\nI just really hate it when people have to say \"this genre/series is formulaic, and it's time for something new.\" Most (but not all) of the time, they're not even aware why the \"conventions\" are there in the first place. The vast majority of video game series are accused of being formulaic for one  reason or another, so I will focus on a roughly B-List series: Kirby. People praised Return to Dream Land for fully reviving Super Star's depth of abilities, with each ability having a variety of moves. Then Triple Deluxe and Planet Robobot are praised for improving upon the previous gameplay more and more. But just because Star Allies, ONE GAME, is underwhelming, people suddenly turn against a core gameplay that has seen progressive improvements? That just comes off as fickle. And for a genre-wide example, there's the entire shooter genre (both FPS and TPS). People love to say that shooters are so old-hat that novel shooters like Splatoon or Fortnite are apparently better on \"newness\" alone.\n\nOn the flip side, I also cannot stand when people want an aged video game series to \"return to its roots\" when it allegedly \"lost its way.\" I see this a lot with series that seemingly pride themselves on building each new installment around completely new concepts, like Sonic, Star Fox, or Final Fantasy. Why are older Sonic games superior for their lack of 3D, lack of story, and characters that play the same? Should Star Fox be doomed to being a rail shooter its whole life? Was Final Fantasy really better when it had ATB and sprite graphics? As for genres, there are JRPGs. Is it really necessary to ignore the visual and gameplay evolution of JRPGs just to prop up explicit throwbacks like Bravely Default and Octopath Traveler as \"what JRPGs should be\"?\n\nI really think more people need to call others out on applying Appeal to Novelty and Appeal to Tradition in video game discussions. Both of these arguments are fallacious and smack of unawareness as to *why* things change or remain the same. And remember: being fallacious doesn't mean you're *wrong*; people who appeal to novelty or tradition can have a good point. They just don't say anything about why a particular tradition or novelty is a good thing.\n\nI fully acknowledge that I may be ignoring the actual arguments in any discussion and focusing on \"it's new\" or \"it's old\", but I just want to get this out there. I see too many valid discussions degenerate into fallacy tennis matches everywhere I up to and including this sub, and I want it to, at the very least, slow down.",

Feel free to read that if you'd like -- it covers the controversy as it happened in various communities, the sentiments of people who were outraged, the reactions of the developers, as well as a lot of gamers who were also supportive. Basically, it looks at both sides of the coin. I also focused a little bit on the digital marketing aspect as well as noted what Psychology teaches us when these things (outrage culture, internet culture) happen.\n\n---------------\n\nSo anyway, Red Shell -- controversial \"spyware\" that ran in the background, gathered data in secret, used for marketing purposes by dev companies.\n\nSome believed it was okay. It was harmless. It wasn't an issue. Browsers, social media, apps, and websites collect data as well. No biggie. Plus, companies need new means on how to analyze their data and their marketing strategies. The internet was probably just overreacting.\n\nOn the flip side, many also felt it was an invasion of privacy and that developers were \"spying\" on them. Some felt that \"data would be sold to the highest bidder\" and that \"gamers were just being sold like cattle.\" In some ways, because of the news in the past several months (data privacy, net neutrality, Cambridge Analytica, hacks divulging accounts, etc), people felt that Red Shell would cause more trouble.\n\nAnd so those discussions erupted across various subreddits and Steam boards. The games which had Red Shell were bombarded with negative reviews. Devs/community managers tried to reason with players, but those who were angry would have none of it. Pretty much everyone just decided to remove it rather than continue discussing and suffer prolonged bad publicity. In a way, it \"wasn't a hill to die on\" given how internet culture has developed.\n\nWhat do you guys at r/truegaming think?\n\n- Was there an overreaction to Red Shell, or were outraged gamers justified?\n- Do you believe it's harmless, or was it harmful?\n- Could developers have better means to discuss it further?\n- Do you think these analytics/big data tools have a place in this new digital age of marketing and game development?",

        "text": "My boy is 8. He just recently got a 3ds. He bought it and a few games with his own money. He is playing through Zelda, a link between worlds and had been having a wonderful time. He loves watching gamers play video games on YouTube. His favorite player is Zack Scott. He wants to be a video game player when he grows up. I tell you all this because I want you to understand exactly how much he loves video games. I was a big gamer when I was a kid and I love that he's enjoying games as much as I did. It's something he and I can bond over and it makes me so happy. I love him so much. \n\nBut yesterday he got stuck. He is scared of the thieves dungeon in low-rule (that's what he calls it, I'm not sure if it's the official name). He is scared of the boss, and the part where you are leading the thief girl and the alligator guys try to attack her. He shuts down and refuses to play any more. I tried to help him through it. I gave him encouragement. I made sure he had fairies as a safety net. I talked about it to him. I watched some YouTube videos of the next part he had to do. I told him I would take over and beat the boss if he lost all his fairies (We had a similar arrangement last boss, which he was also scared of. That was enough for him to try, and he beat it without my help.) I tried meditating with him to help him calm his mind. I've reminded him of how good he is at the game to try to give him confidence. But he's still emotionally stuck. Whenever I get him to try playing, he just keeps it paused and says \"I'm too scared\" and shuts down. He won't even try. I've done everything I can think of to help him play the game and get over his fears.\n\nI want so much to just do it for him. Maybe I should. I've had a lot of problems in my past with depression and anxiety. I want to help him get over his fears so he can be emotionally healthy as a kid, like I never was. I want the best for him. My depression started when I was just a few years older than him and I'm trying to help him develop healthy habits for dealing with his emotions to help him in the future.\n\nI don't really know what to expect from Reddit. A second perspective I guess, and if anyone has advice for ways to help him. Or if I should should just do it for him, he's just a kid after all, and there will be other chances to face his fears. I'm conflicted and just want what's best for him. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your comments. There was tons of encouragement and that really helped. There were some criticisms and I appreciate that too. I'm not a perfect parent, and I blow some things out of proportion. It hurt me to see how excited he was to play the game, only to shut down every time he got to this part. I recognize that I conflated him making it through this dungeon with him being able to enjoy the rest of the game. He used his scoot fruit to escape the dungeon since he was locked in, I didn't know that was an option or I would have suggested it sooner. Part of the problem was he didn't want to redo his progress, so he didn't want to exit the game. This was a nice way to bypass that problem, so I'm proud of his problem solving skills. He's back to exploring the world and is still happy with the game. We will tackle that dungeon later, and all of your perspectives helped me realize that even if \"later\" is a year or two down the road, then that's just fine. Thank you all for your perspective, I greatly appreciate it. And a special shoutout to /u/dapperzan for his generosity. Good vibes and positive thoughts to you all. &lt;3",

        "text": "The examples popped into my head right away would be *Red Dead Redemption, Sleeping Dogs* and *Alpha Protocol.* While these games haven't exactly been the showstopping mainstream success of multiplayer games, all of them have had a rather good cult following (and coming up positively in many discussions) despite not being franchises in the slightest and it led me to thinking the advantages of making a game based on film genres.\n\nFirst things first, most singleplayer games of this type is mostly about selling a fantasy. \"You get to be X\" is the main selling point of these games (and I cast a wide net here. I'm generalising to basically all single player AAA and AA games which aren't overtly deconstructive, abstract or low on gameplay like your Telltale stuff) and in those example the X is a pretty commonplace fantasy, I'd wager. A badass cowboy, Hong Kong police or Secret Agent. Why these fantasies work especially well is because of how strong place they have in popular culture, even just as vague abstracts.\n\nThat's really why I think it works, it simplifies the creative goalline of the game. Everything is built around X, where X is the fantasy of playing as a Hong Kong undercover police officer in Sleeping Dogs, and it works incredibly well. The animations, the artstyle, the clothes, the storyline, it feels concentrated and distinct while still being an easy sell.\n\nThe most common praise for the game *Arkham Asylum* is how much it makes you feel like Batman. Despite all theorising of the simplicity of the combat, it works together with the overall artstyle, sound design and animation so well the effect is cathartic. You fulfill the fantasy of really being the Batman. It's the same concept. Some thing with the popularity of the *Friday the 13th* game. Something which really wouldn't have worked so well without the franchise name and the attachment of it to popular culture. \n\nOverall, advantages with this being:\n\nEasy, uncomplicated sell: \"This game allows you to be X!\"\n\nFocuses direction of the game.\n\nAnd the most important: Introduces an aesthetic from a different cultural sphere. For all the talk of different cultures and diversifying and all that which is such an important hot topic in the game industry, very few games seem to be based off of people who aren't 20's to 30's urban hipsters and nerds (with beards and zany haircuts), even many Japanese games stem from very similar insular worldviews and creative ideas. It makes game actually stand out in a way which isn't a gimmick.",

But there's a big problem: Everything takes so much time to happen!  \n\n* Going to cast a spell? Wait for the animation to end. Every single time, for every single spell..\n* Got the wrong move? Wait for the character to move until the new position to finally cancel it and go back.\n* Died when you got into a hard battle and didn't save? Well, too bad, go back and do the last 4 battles again, because you forgot to save. Better luck next time!\n\nI mean, this isn't exactly bad - it's the design of those games. But after playing FFTA on an emulator, I can definitely say that some features like **Fast Forward** and **Save States** can make certain games better. Fast Forward makes the battles end so much quicker, and you can do a lot more in less time, which is great for a game that encourages grinding. This way, I can play a lot of battles during the bus ride to work, or in my lunch time. This can also help in repeated playthroughs.\n\nI don't like the use of save states to cheat - I usually save before a battle or in the formation screen, so it's quick to retry if something goes wrong. But save states can have other uses, mainly for experimentation. Sometimes, certain rules of the game aren't very clear, and having the option to experiment before proceeding can make certain encounters or situations easier in a way that the player doesn't feel cheated, which is awesome.\n\nIn the end, it's quality of life stuff. You may or may not use it (**you always have the option!**), but, for some games, I can't live without those features. They help a lot, and I can't help but love that!",

Which works well enough for the game, but really rips out a lot of the RP in RPG.  Not that there aren't options and choices, but that few of them actually feel \"weighty\" beyond choosing different flavors of NPC's to join you past the main quest.\n\nTelltale focuses their gameplay around the \"choice\", which can be really fun to go through choosing different options.  Again very few of the choices *actually matter*; beyond which NPC's stay alive/continue with you - the story between Lee and Clem (and later as Clem alone) stays more or less identical regardless of what you choose.  In a way, it's got that \"choose your story\" aspect to it.\n\nAnd then, Deus Ex, Human Revolution.  It's shining grace was making most of the dialogue in the game optional; there was almost always another path around/through a mission (and it'd probably involve using a variety of the other augments).  But the system was, and is, \"the same\".  Here's a handful of options, thankfully you can see what Jensen is about to say (way back in HR's release even, years before Fallout 4 needed mods to do the same).\n\n____________________\n\nIs it a system that works?  Yeah, and I get it, if it ain't broke don't fix it.\n\nBut it's been about 7 years since Deus Ex: HR released.  Telltale's Walking Dead and Fallout 4 are 'newer'.  I'm confident saying DXHR probably isn't the first game to use it, either.\n\nFrom what I've seen of Detroit: Become Human, it's again more of the same \"pick 4\" kind of situation, and about all they did is attach a compelling story with branches with it -- they really didn't innovate much of the limited options beyond making them pop up 'cinematically'.\n\nThe design has gone about as far as it can in a sense -- it's time for something new.\n",

There seems to be this disdain for the “games as a service” model, that games offer a prolonged experience, almost unending until that particular game’s lifespan is over and its sequel or yearly iteration replaces it.\n\nBut, what do you guys think — is the “games as a service” model workin simply because players also want it?\n\nFor instance, if you take a look at various franchises, you’ll notice that fans clamor for more content, more DLC, more stuff to buy to add to the game. In Total War, players ask when the next Lord or Faction would be available for purchase/download. In FPS games, players also anticipate big updates that have new maps, cosmetics, stuff to grind, etc.\n\nBasically, people want to play THE SAME GAME for a longer time period, and want things that enrich and add to that experience. In this manner, the “games as a service” isn’t necessarily limited to developers pushing it down people’s throats. More often than not, the consumers themselves also want these things and are accepting of it because it allows them to enjoy something they have invested in.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Thanks for any replies.\n\n—————\n\nPS: I am 100% sure there will be a “wake up sheeple” or “people are being manipulated like sheep” comment somewhere in here eventually. That kind of implies that the player himself never had a choice in the matter from the get-go, when the choice always remains with the individual.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/92a9dl/why_i_sold_xenoblade_chronicles_2_after_40_hours/",
        "text": "I recently put about 40 hours into XC2 before selling the game. Octopath Traveler was on the horizon and I needed something I could really sink my teeth into for about a month. And, in a way, I got what I wanted. XC2 certainly doesn't leave the player wanting for things to do- in fact, I would say that the game is absolutely bursting with tasks to complete. It's the type of game we're talking about when we say an \"epic RPG experience.\" It offers gorgeous visuals and sound, seemingly endless customization, and lovable characters. When you put it that way, it sounds like my dream game- and I don't think I'm alone in saying that. However, there is a huge, glaring issue with the design of the game that becomes impossible to ignore as you play: XC2 is designed to waste your time. Like, constantly. Let me explain what I mean.\n\nSo, this game has a million and one mechanics. It's extremely deep, complex, and offers nearly endless options... or that's what you think at first. The game is structured around four activities: combat, blade customization, exploration, and narrative. Of these, narrative receives the vast majority of the focus, followed by combat, then blades, then exploration. Each one is fairly simple despite the game's constant attempts at obfuscating and complicating them. Combat, for example, is an interplay between timed button presses and strategic use of elemental skills. Sounds easy to grasp, except that the way the game presents the information makes learning like pulling teeth. Rather than line up your skill combos in an intuitive and informative way on the HUD, XC2 uses an abstract, arcane diagram where skills are represented by colored icons in a sort of horizontal tree shape, and only the name and element of the next possible combo is written. The chart's meaning, AKA the combo system, isn't explained until around 15-20 hours in, at which point a disembodied text dump will tell you all about it. That comes off as odd, because the player is exposed to the combo system practically right off the bat and is expected to make use of it all throughout the early game without instruction. Then, hours after being forced to figure it out on your own (A valid design choice), the tutorial graces you with its empty presence. This purposeful obfuscation of information is annoying and makes the player feel that they're being given the tools to enjoy the game way, way after they're due.\n\nBlade customization is similarly frustrating, if not more so. First off, welcome to RNG land. When it comes to getting Blades, you are essentially opening a randomized loot box that adds a Blade to your collection. At first you'll get some really interesting (And sexy!) characters out of this, but it soon becomes an exercise in frustration as you roll countless times, trying to find something other than one of the generic, robotic \"common\" Blades that make up the majority of the possible roster. Once you actually get a good Blade, you'll want to outfit it with the best-available gear and all of its favorite items to get sweet, sweet ability unlocks. This is where the Blade system intersects with the design of the world; every town has several shops such as a baker, a musical instrument seller, a butcher, and so on, where you can pick up stuff for your waifu just to see if she'll like it. This clogs up every town in the game with too many merchants who all essentially sell \"Blade items.\" It could have been just one or two shops for \"Blade stuff,\" greatly streamlining the player's experience, but that isn't what this game wants. It wants you to spend 20 hours running around, and it's gonna cram whatever arbitrary padding it can in there to make that happen.\n\nSo of course you're going to need something to look at while you wait, right? And oh man does the game deliver on that front! The world is gorgeous, spacious, and crawling with life. This is definitely one of the game's strong points, and one of the reasons I bought it in the first place. Monolith Soft really flexes the same muscles that designed BotW's map here, and actually the results are, visually, an absolute triumph in docked mode. However, beneath the shining exterior is... not a whole lot, really. The map reminds me a lot of f2p MMOs from ten years ago. It looks great, but has no depth. There are no physics to speak of, other than a pretty lackluster approximation of gravity (Rex jumps like he's on the moon until he hits the top of the jump arc and sinks like a stone). Towns are little more than an assembly of merchants selling \"Blade stuff,\" and you'll find none of the subtle charms of BotW's Hyrule here. Loot collection in the wild, for instance, consists of walking to a floating icon, pressing A, and watching the same canned animation every time. This is clearly the area of the game that needs the most improvement for next time. It was the biggest disappointment of all and probably the final straw in my decision to sell the game off- at the end of the day, there's just not a lot here to find.\n\nDo I think Xenoblade Chronicles 2 does anything well? Of course! The characters are memorable, the music is great, the art style is very good, and while I don't personally love the story, I know that many players actually do. However, if you're like me and looking for more of a hands-on, engaging experience in an RPG rather than strong narrative, I say definitely skip it. The game treats the player like they desperately want to throw their time away doing something, anything, even if it's a list of chores. XC2 is a charming, but extremely clunky and unrefined game that I'm sure will be sparking internet arguments for decades. I would love to hear some responses and see what everyone else is thinking.",

        "title": "What will the future of Nintendo's handheld line look like, as well as that of the Switch itself?",
        "author": "GamoTron21",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/92a53s/what_will_the_future_of_nintendos_handheld_line/",
        "text": "With the awkwardly-timed introduction of the Switch and the 3DS's still-continuing tremendously long lifespan, it seems to be increasingly difficult to predict what Nintendo has in store for the future. While it can be assumed that the \"next-gen\" Xbox and PS consoles are going to release within the next couple of years, Nintendo's product lines are all over the place at the moment, and it's hard to guess what Nintendo's competitors entering the 9th gen will mean for Nintendo and the Switch, as well as what the Switch will mean for the future of Nintendo's line of traditional handhelds.\n\nWhile Nintendo at one point typically released their consoles around the same time as those of the competitors, this changed with the Wii U, which launched a full year before the other consoles of the 8th generation, and had technically been finalized as far back as 2011. This put the Wii U in an awkward position when trying to determine what generation it belonged to; not only did it release well before the other competitors of the 8th generation, it also had the power of a 7th generation console (whereas the original Wii had the power of a 6th generation console), making the Wii U's placement, while generally accepted as being within the 8th generation, unclear due to its inability to match the other 8th generation consoles just as with how the original Wii failed to match the other 7th generation consoles. Now, in a time period which could roughly be described as \"the 8.5th generation\", where Sony and Microsoft have both released interim major hardware upgrades to their existing consoles, Nintendo has released the Switch, which is an entirely new console which still only has power comparable to that of a 7th generation system, or most generously is somewhere in between the 7th and 8th generation. Unlike the Wii U, however, where this was arguably a clear mistake on Nintendo's part to not make the system more powerful than its last-generation counterparts, the Switch has an excuse for the underwhelming performance; Nintendo essentially had to pick between power, price, and portability/battery life when designing the Switch, and in typical Nintendo fashion (not that it was necessarily a mistake), they chose price and portability. While the Wii U was infamously both inferior to 7th generation consoles in some aspects and superior to them in others (yet still not matching 8th generation consoles on any front), the Switch has continued this strange position of power with a new architecture, providing needed boosts to the Wii U's amount of power in some areas yet even slightly detracting from it in others; however still not matching even the original Xbox One. \n\nHow is all of this talk about power relevant to the Switch's future? Because it impacts third-party support for the system. During most of the Wii U era, especially the initial part of it, the vast majority of new releases, even major ones, were still being released on PS3/360; as such, they had the technical capability to be ported to Wii U, but this was almost never done (aside from some near-launch titles and a few rare exceptions such as some of the CoD games) due to the Wii U's horrible sales performance. Now that the Switch has rolled around, it can still perfectly take on seventh-generation games and games that are too much for seventh-generation consoles (particularly RAM-wise), but the industry has since mostly moved on from earlier consoles, and as such developers which a few years ago would simply port the 7th-gen version of their games to the Switch will now find themselves having no choice but to rewrite their major AAA games just to run on the Switch, which will inevitably result in major graphics and performance downgrades from the other platform versions of the games as well as some games simply not being feasible to make work on the Switch. While this is already a problem now and is leading to the Switch having limited (although not nonexistent) success with AAA ports, this will be an even bigger problem in a couple years when gaming moves on to the next generation, and Nintendo's current hardware, which already struggles to handle current-gen games, will find itself completely left in the dust as developers will have to effectively port their 9th-gen AAA games back one and a half generations for them to run at all on the Switch. \n\nHowever, I **don't** believe that this will endanger the Switch in the future, as this is already a big enough problem with current games that most AAAs are not being ported to Switch, and it's getting along on smaller titles and Nintendo exclusives which have proven to be its main draw, over AAAs which most would prefer to play on another platform anyways. I'm more curious about what direction this will lead Nintendo to go in for the Switch's inevitable successor; will the first successor to the Switch be an upgraded design model with no change to internal hardware (as they've done with their previous handhelds), an upgraded design model with a slight but not extremely significant boost to hardware (such as the Xbox One S), a full-on update such as the PS4 Pro/One X, or will they forgo a stopgap successor entirely as with their previous home consoles (remember, the Switch is being marketed as one) and have the first new release simply be an entirely new console several years from now? Seeing as how the Switch is already in need of a power boost, and that Nvidia SoCs which surpass the one in the Switch have existed since before the Switch was released (it's effectively 2015 hardware), I find it quite likely that we'll either get a major hardware revamp around the time the next of the industry enters the 9th generation, bringing the Switch up to around 8th generation standards, or that Nintendo will hold off entirely as they have done with previous home consoles and wait until an entirely new console is ready to make any major hardware changes. If they go with the \"major upgrade but not new console\" route, I'd assume that it'd either be like the PS4 Pro or One X where games are enhanced but do not only work on the upgraded model, or that it will be like the New 3DS where certain games are only compatible with the new model. Considering that the former will limit developers and remove some of the point of the hypothetical revision's existence, as well as continuity with previous products, I'm guessing that the latter would be the case in this hypothetical upgrade. \n\nBut, when the inevitable true successor to the Switch does arrive, what will it be like? This is perhaps the most difficult question to answer, as the Switch's core concept somewhat puts a stop to Nintendo's typical way of designing new consoles, however I believe that there is a potential route which they will take. Nintendo has been known for focusing their consoles around a central theme or gimmick, then changing their focus to a new gimmick in the next console release; however, unlike with previous Nintendo consoles, it is difficult to approximate what the Switch's \"gimmick\" actually is. While the obvious answer is the hybrid functionality, this is not a tacked-on gimmick feature as with the Wii's motion controls or Wii U's GamePad which could theoretically be removed; it is a core concept that embodies everything else about the Switch itself, and it simply could not be separated from the Switch without completely changing the dynamic and design of the entire hardware. Due to the magnitude of this new hybrid mechanic, as well as Nintendo's merger of their console and handheld development teams, it seems unlikely that Nintendo will simply scrap this concept in their next console to focus on something else; I believe that it is much more likely that this is the direction which all Nintendo consoles will take from now on, becoming Nintendo's signature trait. As such, the Switch's successor is likely to be something similar to what the Wii U was to the Wii; embodying similar core concepts and maintaining backwards compatibility and general design, but introducing new features and \"gimmicks\" to differentiate the system; Nintendo has always been adamant about making each console release distinct from their previous ones and never focusing solely on raw power upgrades, and this is something which seems unlikely to change even with this new direction. As for what these new gimmicks will be, well, that's quite unpredictable knowing Nintendo, but it may expand on the existing HD Rumble and IR features which some may see as the \"secondary\" gimmicks of the Switch as it is.\n\nBut where does all this leave the 3DS? The 3DS has had a ridiculously long and storied lifespan; it came out in 2011 almost 2 years before even the Wii U came out, trudged along with weak sales numbers for the first couple years along with the PS Vita before exploding in popularity around 2013-2014, continuing this explosion through 2015 as the New 3DS came out, got another boost in late 2016 from Pokemon, and has still been maintaining decent sales ever since. While it's easy to argue that the 3DS is clearly reaching the end of its life, Nintendo themselves have stated that the 3DS's end of life is not coming soon, and there are still semi-major first-party 3DS releases happening in 2019, indicating that Nintendo is truly not ready to kill off the 3DS just yet; they have also stated in the past that they believe the 3DS and the Switch can coexist. Regardless, surely the 3DS must eventually meet its end; it will soon be an 8 year old platform that has outrode the lifespan of most of Nintendo's previous platforms, except for the original Game Boy. The 3DS will end, but the two lingering questions are \"when?\" and \"what will replace it?\" As Nintendo has little in the form of prerequisites or clues for this situation, these are extremely difficult questions to answer. It seems possible that the 3DS will be cut off around 2020, seeing as how it's unlikely that there will be any new semi-major releases for the system after 2019; however, this is just a prediction, and Nintendo's insistence that the 3DS still has a long life ahead of it and that it can coexist with the Switch may hint at an even longer lifespan; I also remember Reggie mentioning something about potential new 3DS hardware revisions, perhaps meaning another hardware upgrade may be in the works. \n\nDespite all this, once the 3DS inevitably dies, what next? Will Nintendo create a successor to the 3DS, or will they simply have released a Switch successor by then and repurpose the Switch to fill the 3DS's place? While it seems hard to imagine Nintendo breaking from their traditional product lineup system so much, they have already done this with the Switch, and I would not be surprised if their strategy is to keep the 3DS alive until a Switch successor is released, then kill off the 3DS for the Switch itself to take its place as a budget system; it is quite possible that by the time such a successor is released, Switch prices will have dropped sufficiently for this purpose, and with this Nintendo can not only replace the 3DS's place in their product lineup with a much technically superior product without developing an entirely new console, but also leverage the Switch's existing library for marketing purposes. I could even see Nintendo creating a Switch hardware revision specifically for this purpose, such as a handheld-only bundle of the Switch. Nintendo is already purposing the 3DS as a \"budget counterpart\" to the Switch and emphasizing the 2D models, and it is likely that they will continue this strategy to purpose the Switch as a \"budget counterpart\" to the Switch 2, whatever it may be called.\n\nWhile Nintendo is unpredictable and it is impossible to determine if this is really what their long-term plan is, it seems like this is the most logical solution for not only the future of the 3DS and Switch, but what will come next after it.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/929jw6/the_3_crucial_elements_of_multiplayer_grind_games/",
        "text": "I think there are 3 elements that are required to make a good multiplayer/MMO grind game. These being gameplay, meaning, and trust. Before I say anymore I'd like to define how I'm using these terms:\n\n1. Gameplay - This refers to the core gameplay loop of the game, how fun it is, and how little problems or holdups it has.\n\n2. Meaning - This refers to the game's attempts to reward the player for their efforts and make them feel accomplished.\n\n3. Trust - This refers to the player's trust that time spent playing the game is time used well. Trust can be spread into many categories which mostly lead to the main idea of community approval. For example: player count, developer reputation, and community reputation.\n\nNow why do you need all three of these elements to make a good grind game? It's because if you don't have all three then every element might as well not exist.I'll go over all the scenarios which involve at least one of these core elements being bad.\n\n\nIf a grinder had good gameplay and meaning but bad trust you would still assume that it would be successful, right? But herd mentality is stronger than actual meaningful content. If people don't see many others playing the game, or others are criticizing it then they will feel less inclined to play it. Another way you could lose your player's trust is by bad business practices or inconsistent content. Not only does this lead to more criticism of the game, it makes the player unsure of the game's stability. To make things worse, a core idea of creating meaning in these types of games is player interaction, so low trust would result in neutered meaningful design.\n\n\nIn the situation that a grinder has good meaning and trust but bad gameplay, players have a reason to play but that reason is neutered by unfun gameplay design. If you're bored then you won't want to play the game in the first place, regardless of rewards. This also hurts trust as the playerbase and game's reputation is lowered, and players are unsure of it's stability even more. Which, again, in turn hurts the other elements even more. An example of this is Trove. There's plenty of meaningful things to do, and the game's trust early on was relatively good. But the gameplay is so incredibly repetitive that it's hard to justify doing anything in it.\n\n\nIf the game has good gameplay and trust, but bad meaning, then it essentially offers no reason for the player to do its content. It may be fun, but it's not fulfilling, which is a core part of why people play video games, especially when it comes to escapism and grinders. Regardless of how much you vary your content, if there's no meaning it'll feel stale, partially because of the grinder's limited potential for variation, and partially due to the current gaming landscape that overwhelmingly supports constant player progression. You can see this by looking at Sea of Thieves. It had fun gameplay but no meaning, which in turn made the gameplay stale and trust of the game's quality incredibly low.\n\n\nAn example of a game successful at this would be Warframe. It has great trust, gameplay, and meaning. The developers and community are highly regarded, the game is very popular, and people 'trust' that it will come out with consistent, quality content which avoids anti-consumer business practices. The game is incredibly varied in its gameplay loop, with varied mission types, characters, weapons, mods, pets, companions and more. It also uses heavily empowering combat systems.This in turn makes it easier to get to the meaningful parts, and increases its reputation and playerbase. It encourages you to level up all these gameplay elements, which is only possible because the gameplay is relatively fun and the players feel like it's using their time effectively.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nTrust, meaning, and gameplay lead to a well made grinder game. If you lack any of these elements then the rest will fall apart and turn the game into an infinite downward spiral.\n\nTell me what you think about my conclusions and whether or not you agree or disagree with them.",
