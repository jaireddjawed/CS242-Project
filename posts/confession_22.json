        "text": "Yo soy una (F20), en estos momentos estoy estudiando para la universidad para Veterinaria, si soy sincera me gusta los animales y me gustar√≠a poder ayudarlos en un √°mbito cl√≠nico si es que puedo, me han gustado desde que era peque√±a pero recientemente mi padre y mi hermano me dicen que no me ven cualidades para ello ya que cuando nuestros perros se enferman dicen que no hago nada, pero eso no es del todo verdad, ya que la que ve a los cachorros de mi casa soy yo y intento hacerlo mejor que pueda para ayudarlos y no tratar de comprometer su salud con remedios caseros, ellos dicen que como nunca estoy con los cachorros 24/7 soy mala o intento buscar en internet remedios caseros (repito no quiero intentarlo por qu√© tengo miedo de hacerles da√±o), pero weno aclaro esto solo para dar un poco de contexto sobre por qu√© decid√≠ veterinaria y tambi√©n que puede que tenga facilidad para ello ( esto lo explico por qu√© mi madre cree que la veterinaria talvez sea un camin√≥ para m√≠)\n\nOkey para que entiendan un poco del por qu√© mis dudas tengo que contarles algo de mi pasado, ver√°n cuando yo estudiaba en la escuela primaria sufr√≠ acoso verbal y psicol√≥gico por parte de mi maestra y compa√±eros, esto no es el t√≠pico siento que el profe me tra√≠a bronca, esto lo se por parte de mi padres por qu√© yo no me acordaba de d√≥nde inicio el problema, pues resulta que cuando ella me llamaba la atenci√≥n yo la miraba a los ojos directamente y yo creo que ella pens√≥ que la rete o no se, pero desde esos momentos ella empez√≥ a amedrentar contra mi, lo que recuerdo es ella dici√©ndome que yo no lograr√≠a ser nada en la vida, que yo era tonta, que era grosera y que si quer√≠a ser algo en la vida tendr√≠a que hacerle caso en todo lo que me dijera, y eso no era todo ella ten√≠a una alumna favorita (para que me entiendan a ella le permit√≠a todo, si llegaba tarde al sal√≥n no le dec√≠a nada, siempre nos comparaba a todos con ella, en una ocasi√≥n sus padres le organizaron un cumplea√±os en el sal√≥n y la profesora lo permiti√≥, tiempo despu√©s un compa√±ero tambi√©n quiso hacer lo mismo y ella dijo que no que est√°n prohibido, de hecho tambi√©n la chica vend√≠a dulces en la escuela lo cual estaba prohibido pero ella lo permiti√≥, pero la profesora si aviso de otros que estaban vendiendo y as√≠ muchos ejemplos)\nLa maestra puso a esa ni√±a a cargo de mi, osea que ella me ense√±ar√° ya que como ella si era perfecto deb√≠a hacer m√°s como ella, la verdad yo ten√≠a sobrepeso y la alumna favorita y mis compa√±eros me molestaban por eso nunca lleg√≥ a nada f√≠sico, pero a esa edad yo me volv√≠ muy retra√≠da y la verdad pensando que no serv√≠a para nada.\nMis otros a√±os escolares eran los mismos mis compa√±eros me acosaban y nadie asia nada, gracias a mi baja autoestima y a lo inferior que me sent√≠a nunca me defend√≠, y eyo solo hizo que el acoso siguiera, talvez sea debido a eso que no conf√≠o en nadie la verdad no tengo con quien desahogarme o si quiera expresarme, apesar de que tengo amigos si soy sincero no parec√≠a interesarles y yo tampoco les contaba por miedo a que si ellos sab√≠an que yo estaba mal, ellos se pusieron triste, con mi familia es igual\n\nLa verdad no s√© si fue debido a eso,(aunque tambi√©n tengo que aceptar que yo tengo culpa de esto en parte, ya que por el miedo que sent√≠a al hacer cosas nuevas las acababa abandonado o si comer√≠a el m√°s peque√±o error me sent√≠a una est√∫pida que no pod√≠a hacer nada bien, y dej√© de intentar cosas y tampoco hice nada por intentar salir de estos h√°bitos, as√≠ que solo escog√≠ el osio y no hacer nada como una excusa)\nNo tengo nada que realmente me apasione o algo que motive, si soy honesta solo escog√≠ veterinaria por el hecho de que me gustan los animales.\nClaro que hay cosas que me gustan: se me dan algo f√°cil los idiomas, soy buena es espa√±ol, me gusta la historia, soy muy curiosa, me gusta un poco la filosof√≠a y me encanta saber cosas nuevas de muchos √°mbitos.\nPero si soy honesta creo que esto no es suficiente para dedicarme alguna de ellas, la verdad algunas no las escojo por qu√© el camino m√°s com√∫n en ellas es la docencia pero no quiero ser maestra, aunque creo que no tendr√≠a problema en ense√±ar a alguien ( tambi√©n estuve investigando y se que tambi√©n algunas de ellas tienen otras ramas que no son necesariamente la docencia), pero no creo que sea lo mejor meterme en cualquiera solo por qu√© si.\nMis padres me apoyan, mi padre me dice que la veterinaria no es lo m√≠o y que deb√≠a meterme a trabajar en lo que decido que hacer, mi madre por otro lado me dice que lo intente para veterinaria (pero siento que quedarme en veterinaria es igual que quedarme atascada nuevamente) pero tengo mucho miedo de expresarme abiertamente con mis padres, ya que antes cuando les intentaba hablar de mis sentimientos a ambos, mi padre es un hombre que a veces no quiere comprender el punto de vista de otras personas, por ello no suelo hablar con esto de el, mi madre por otro lado es un poco m√°s comprensiva, pero siempre que hablo de mis sentimientos siento que los minimiza o que me rega√±a ya que ella dice que como me siento no es nada y que tengo que dejar de complicar me.\nAs√≠ que estoy pensando en ponerme a trabajar o combinar de carrera?\nUstedes que har√≠an en mi lugar, me gustar√≠a saber las opiniones que tiene de esto en los comentarios, cualquier duda que tenga pueden preguntarme tambi√©n.\ngracias por escuchar :3",

        "text": "I'm remembering things from my past. My English isn't great because I never got the chance to develop it. I think there were offers by companies from Nintendo to Disney to Nick. I was being childish, so I told a girl to speak as quietly as they possibly could. She was buying, but what I had wasn't for sale. I think I made a joke about fucking my mom, hence the Regular Show joke about it. I think it was just a series of musunderstandings. I think I told her I don't want to learn sarcastically, or maybe because I was the \"breadwinner\", she wouldn't tell me what to do. I needed guidance. I think part of the misunderstanding lead her to rape me. She was gentle, so I barely noticed. Regardless, it was still rape and I feel violated. I think she kept saying \"deal\" and \"no deal\" whoever she was, but because she took my glasses and was quiet, I had no idea. I know it sounds bizarre. I don't know where my dad was in all this. I loved him. I would have been a genius. I think I have been written about for what little there is to write on different networks. I think I met Dylan and Cole Sprouse as well. I think they were maliciously compliant. I wasn't requesting, I was just testing. I remember drawing Ash Ketchum with Pikachu. I think I said I didn't want something I received, but I meant that I needed it, but regardless, it wasn't hers to take. I feel like my entire life, whatever it may have become, has been wasted. I feel like I was tortured and gaslit because of some joke some idiot took too seriously. I was just a kid playing around. I think this is were ASMR derives, too. Now, my childhood, education, art, and free time were all wasted. I think she told other people that I was Buddhist and don't want anything and that I was her sugar daddy. I think it's considered grade A torture, but the courts wouldn't agree if I tried, and it's not like it matters at this point. I'm already suicidal, not that I want to die. I want my dad. I want the psychological torture removed. I want my childhood intact and my future secured, but there's nothing I can do about it now, and they got away with it, whoever they are. I was talented, too.",

(we dont) plus it was just the principle of getting the matter, not really for the money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbefore i found out about how much money i was getting i bought a laptop. speed back up to last night, i wanted to find a file for some reason or another and was greeted by a microsoft note book file (never have i even opened note book) that said \"in laws name, note book\". shocked at what i found, i quickly opened it to hopefully find sweet juicy evidence to possibly help our case. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbut what i actually found could not help in the case at all. instead i found a handwritten journal log with what things were like, financially, at the time i worked for him. im not going to get into details, but he was up to his neck in dept almost as soon as he started his company. starting a company takes money, some times loans, and i get that. but he never made enough. he has so much dept you could buy 40 toyota camrys before you seen the same amount of debt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthis came as a wild shock as he always seemed he at least made enough to start another job. do i tell him i know and confess? i want to talk to him, not about the lawsuit, but about the fact that i will be the last thing he adds to his debt pile to collectively shut down and lose everything he has ever had. i had malice towards him but i thought it would be something he would be able to seriously over come but still make it difficult. but no. i will ruin his entire life, and i feel awful. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nim not going to stop the lawsuit, if i could i still wouldnt. this is the worse thing i have ever done to a human being and it was on accident. i dont want to be his friend or anything but i want him to know that i know, and i am sorry for the lawsuit. if i wouldve known how bad it was i wouldve let the ship sink. instead i will be the one dropping the bomb.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni feel like shit, and he did treat me and the other employees bad. and stole from us. but even, im not sure if all this was really worth it in the end. fuck me",

I know this, my therapist told me this, and lead me through a thought excersise about how I was sober and even though I was scared I had ok boundaries, what if I was drunk, or more vulnerable? \n\n\nSo I reported him, knowing uber is his full-time income and I feel guilty as I got an email saying that he may have his rights to uber revoked due to it. \nI don't know what I wanted from reporting it. But now it's real and I've done the report and was true and honest about what happened, and the uber team is making this decision I feel like it's my fault and I should have done more to prevent it in the first place maybe like loosing his job is too hard because he didn't assault me or do anything violent. \n\nThat's it that's the confession",
