I now understand that the thing I'd initially assumed was a generic web form, is actually a clone of the lastpass client implementation running in javascript. It does all of the right things to ensure that the master password never goes further than the browser's sandbox, and the server side receives only the email + a hash.\n\nThat hash, meanwhile is used like a typical password (only a salted hash of the hash is stored) on the server side. Lastpass uses it to control access to the encrypted vault (not just anyone can retrieve a copy of it) as well as for doing any server-side account stuff, like keeping track of family features.\n\nThe main new risks of using the web service is that we're typing the password into a just-seen-it-now-for-the-first-time javascript application, rather than into the widely-reviewed-and-not-often-changing client application.\n\nIt's not a web form, but is it malicious?

Two semesters ago we had IT security lecutre and I really liked it. So I have spent the last two semesters taking classes which I think are important in that field, like networks for example.\n\nNow let's get to the problem where I need some advice. I talked to my professor and she said I only can do an internship + bachelor thesis in that field if I do something as a topic that has something to do with bioinformatics. She said she would accept a bachelor thesis about a pentest of a hospital, because there you have to make sure that biological/medical data are safe. The problem here is no company can promise me that they will get a hospital as a customer when I do my internship there.\n\nSo I thaught about topics that use bioinformatics to solve netsec problems. I came up with using global alignments to examin network protocols. After some googling I found a tool that already does it: [http://www.4tphi.net/\\~awalters/PI/PI.html](http://www.4tphi.net/~awalters/PI/PI.html)\n\nSo I thought about taking their project as a base and build upon it and try to use their output to generate a grammar for a fuzzer like sulley/boofuzz or peach fuzzer.\n\nDo you guys think that's an acceptable thesis? Would any IT sec company take me to do that?\n\nCan you guys maybe think of any other topics that I missed that would somehow use bioinformatics to solve an IT Sec problem?\n\nThanks for your replies in advance",

I know if I comprimised a linux box and have a crappy shell I can spawn a TTY shell. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there an equivalent of this for a Windows shell? My tab copleteion doesnt work, arrow keys dont work. \n\nI cant find the equivalent and I also cant get powershell to work.. It will launch powershell but then my shell cant read anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot looking for an explaination but a point in the right direction to upgrading Windows shell to something similar to TTY upgrade on linux or how to get powershell to print to my shell correctly would be awesome. Any keywords or references appreciated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks",

Have used squid3 as a transparent HTTP/HTTPS proxy with [ssl peek](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslPeekAndSplice) to compare remote host against a whitelist to allow/deny the connection (not doing man-in-the-middle; squid only sees the unencrypted portion of the ssl handshake).\n\n​\n\nBut, this has caused many difficult to debug issues (e.g. clients that do not support SNI, or a particular GNU TLS client that can't make a connection while OpenSSL clients can...).\n\n​\n\nAnd I also have concerns about the long-term future of this approach given things like [SNI encryption](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-sni-encryption-03).\n\n​\n\nI'm not familiar with commercial offerings in this space, but one commercial cloud firewall appliance allows to whitelist outbound traffic by domain: I happen to know it does periodic DNS lookups of the whitelisted domain, then whitelists the resulting IPs. This sounds great, but it refreshes the DNS lookup only every 30 min, which in some cases is insufficient.\n\n​\n\nI have also used squid3 in a non-transparent, traditional proxy setup. This introduces much pain, as different software and libraries honor or do not honor different combinations of environment variables such as `https_proxy`, `NO_PROXY` (and JVM is completely different), and configuration errors are time consuming to debug.\n\n​\n\nSo what's best practice here? Forget egress firewall (given the dearth of info, I assume this is what most cloud apps do...)? Something else?\n\n​\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "text": "I’ve been working desktop support for the past 4 years. In this time I’ve done a lot of side projects and lots of general experimentation (home lab, CTFs, etc) at home, including some “professional” projects with tier 2 and 3 teams at my company. These have consisted of large scale AD scripting/automation, virtualization management in VMware/Citrix, and now actually developing a custom web pentesting tool for the InfoSec team. All my time in IT at this company I’ve really devoted to working closely with the tier 2 and 3 teams so I’ve developed a good relationship with them all.\n\nWhat I’m trying to get to is does the path to security have to go through server/networking? I’ve been told this by the Director at my job a year or 2 ago, that in order to be a Jr. Security Analyst you need to be a Sr. Server or Network Engineer. I’m not saying he’s wrong, but there are legitimate hackers/pentesters/security researchers that I personally follow on social media that have never done these jobs before. I understand what he’s saying and it makes sense, but is this necessarily the case?\n\nI am really interested in servers in networking obviously with what I said before, but I plan on taking the OSCP around this time next year after I finish my university term in 2019 and am hoping to test the market to see if I can land a junior pentesting role, or ideally getting a position made for me at my current job. Either way I don’t want to stay on desktop support with an OSCP.\n\nSo what do you think? Does the career path have to be so linear? Can you be a successful hacker with no “professional” networking or server experience?",

I love playing with malware and playing around with pen-test related stuff (bug bounty, ctf, trying new tools, etc.).\n\nDuring the interview I was told to expect a daily meeting, research on 3 things (Malware, APT and IoC) and most of  the time looking around the company/client infrastructure for a potential threat. Is this the case for other Threat Hunter out there? Is there anything different in your day that will most likely be important? I also have question about the tools/cheat-sheets/books/github-repos that you use every day in your hunting life? Would you recommend a certain certification for specialization or for career advancement (e.g. SANS/GIAC GREM for Reverse Engineering)? And lastly, what is the advice you would give to a newbie in Threat Hunting field?\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "text": "Hi,\n\n**TL;DR: My debit card got charged for purchases I didn't make; Bank only advises waiting and chargebacks; I'm a pretty security sensitive computer programmer, so my ego is shattered; Please help my ego.\n**\n\nI use Revolut - a British, mobile-only, \"digital bank\" - for most of my day to day expenses.\n\nMain advantages are:\n\n* instant push notifications to my phone for each transaction (if I have mobile data available...).\n* money is moved instantly between Revolut accounts, so can split dinner bills with friends pretty easily.\n* interbank exchange rate for foreign currencies.\n* lets you disable various transaction types; for example, I have \"magnetic stripe transactions\", and \"internet transactions\" (normally) always turned off.\n\nDisadvantages (so this doesn't sound like a /r/HailCorporate post) are:\n\n* high fees for ATM withdrawals.\n* they seem like they have very few support staff, with most issues taking days to even get in contact.\n* they seem to have handled this fraud case pretty badly. Their only advise was just to wait and make a chargeback.\n\nI was on holidays in Vienna, Austria last week; flew in Monday, left on a boat (to Bratislava) on Wednesday. While on the boat leaving on the Wednesday I received push notifications for a couple of transactions that nearly cleared out my account. Each transaction has a reference text field, pointing to various fashion websites around Europe, but I believe people can edit these text fields freely, so it's not much to go on.\n\nI went back over my transaction history, and every transaction (save Uber) were in-person using hand-held devices, and either Contactless, or Chip &amp; PIN (no magnetic stripes). Do Contactless or Chip &amp; PIN card skimmers exist? What information do they leak?\n\nThe one online transaction was on Tuesday night; I added my Revolut card to Uber. Uber's \"pre-authorisation\" charge required me to turn on my card's \"internet transactions\", and required it on again to allow for an actual ride charge to go through.\n\nIf the reference text fields pointing to online shops are to be believed, the scammers would have needed the card number, expiry date, and CVV code? Unless these are exposed by Chip &amp; PIN skimmers (which I don't believe are), this would point to Uber being a possible place this was leaked? I was using mobile data, not WiFi, during the trip, but I would assume the Uber App uses pinned SSL certs? (I asked them this directly via a Twitter DM, and they said they would forward it to proper team, but no other response. I noticed there was an Uber update released the night after I mentioned it to them. Coincidence?).\n\nAnother possibility is that the details were somehow skimmed in Ireland before I left, and the scammers sat on them (possible selling them in bulk on the darkweb) for couple of weeks.\n\nRevolut itself could also have been breached, but I suspect more people would be complaining if that was they case.\n\nAny flaws in my thinking?\n\nThanks,\n  Thomas\n\n",

It's in subscribers only mode, but there's literally nobody talking in the chat which leads me to this suspicion. Second of all, apparently in the title it's about Sparc Mac quitting streaming due to \"personal issues\", although anyone with 4K concurrent viewers wouldn't just quit streaming unless the issue was severe. \n\nIn the bio, it writes how he's quitting and includes a link for the \"full story\" to find out his reasons. Stupid of me, I ended up clicking the link but very soon after realized A: the link looks suspicious and not legit, and B: nobody talking in the chat is also suspicious and C: why is there a \"tg\" at the end of \"sparcmac\" in his stream username and D: it's a brand new twitch account with very few followers and vods. \n\nI'm almost certain this is fake and the link included is used for phishing. But, my main concern is, is there anything else on this website that could potentially execute on your PC and download malware such as a RAT without clicking anything other than the link itself? (not accepting java runs etcetc). If anyone could take a look at this link and is experienced in being able to reverse the site to make sure there's no threats executing upon clicking it, it would be greatly appreciated and give me an ease of mind, maybe I'm just being overly paranoid. \n\nCaution, this is the link -&gt;\n\n&gt;hxxps://secure.runescape.com-mjw.top/m=weblogin/new\\_login638,979,219,31324917,1023\n\n\\[i replaced https with hxxps, to get to the site replace hxxps with https\\]\n\nI don't recommend typing any useful information in the login areas as I'm certain this is a phishing link judging by the link itself, while everything else looks very legit.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nBasically, what I'm asking is, can anyone make sure this site doesn't contain exploit kits or attempts to launch any malicious attacks, if that's possible?

The router will show as connected, the box shows all signals strong and all settings and indicators appear normal and unchanged but I can't browse or access the internet in anyway.\n\nIf I restart the router immediately, it tends to restore internet access (sometimes I have to do this 2 or 3 times) but if I leave it it will take about 10-15mins to restore access.\n\n\nThe random network that shows is typically only visible for about 2-3mins and then it disappears regardless of what I do. I believe I might have noticed it once or twice while the modem/router was off but I can't recall for sure now.\n\n\nThe thing is I never paid much attention to this until now and I'm not 100% sure of some of the details. It just seems to be a very strange set of coincidences and I basically, my spider sense is tingling....\n\n\nCould it be my router has been hacked? Or maybe my laptop?\n\nThings I've been able to check isolate:\nI have three wifi modems/routers and I have observed this repeatedly with all but one of them which I never use at home. The one I don't use at home is a 4g mifi device.\n\nI got a new router a while back and that was almost unusable, the situation discussed above would happen every couple of hours sometimes with even greater frequency so I switched back to the older one.\n\nThe problem, never before noticed with the current one, which I used for years before (Not in the same location I am now) just started acting like this now.\n\nI don't think it's my ISP because I use the mifi when I'm out and about and I have never yet experienced this issue with that device. Only with the two bigger devices.\n\nPlease, any advice or opinions on what might be going on?",

        "text": "For all those out there managing network IPS (either next gen fw blades or separate appliances), how do you keep on top of your signature/protection base? \n\nFor older protections that don't get automatically aged out, at what point do you start disabling them? It's generally easy enough to sort out specific vendor protections you know aren't relevant to your environment but when it comes to say Microsoft, do you just keep older protections in place when you can't be certain what hosts are vulnerable anymore (someone's hidden an old NT server box somewhere)? Even the vendor optimised lists tend to still have an insane amount of protections enabled from ages ago. I'm fine with tuning new/custom ones as they come through. I just really want to clean up what's currently in block mode so we aren't wasting system resources. \n\nI suppose people's methods differed depending on if they built it from the ground up vs inheriting it.",
