He asked for honest opinions and I didn't like the way he wrote the female characters, so I'm going all out.   \n\n\n\\[It is to be noted, I am very very pleased by the way he took the feedback, kudos to him honestly as it takes guts and strong will to read feedback and not deflect it, rather to learn from it. PLEASE CAN MALE WRITERS get women, POC, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ people etc to read and give feedback on your writing before it goes to print. This suggestion I gave was only a small part of the things I was able to show him about the way his writing of female characters could be improved and now his books will appeal to so many more people!\\]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/loi8m008ghfa1.png?width=614&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=877d0473fe976cfaec5b92d268eda746655b5734",
