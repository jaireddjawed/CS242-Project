        "text": "A couple years ago, I played in a Savage World campaign set in a homebrew world inspired by old-timey fantasy Quebec/French Canada. An isolated woodcutter village, at the border of the known lands in the middle of woods full of weird creatures. The closest garrison moved away since the village is too small and the war with the English requires a lot of troops. So we're a bunch of villagers who self-appointed as a local militia/problem-solvers. Woodcutters, farmers, an old swiss alchemist fleeing the old continent, etc.\n\nThe village is facing a plague curse from a witch, we seek the wisdom of an entity far in the northern land. We eventually arrive at a large river, then find a place shallow enough to cross. One problem : the giant in the way.\n\n\"HUMANS. I'M THE GUARDIAN OF THE RIVER. IF YOU WISH TO CROSS, YOU NEED TO BEST ME IN A TEST OF STRENGTH.\"\n\nWe chat among ourselves. Jo, the woodcutter, is built like a bear, min-maxed pure strength, and also a werebeaver, but it still looks like he's outmatched here. We're gonna have to outsmart the big guy.\n\nOne of us picks up a rock from the ground when the giant isn't looking. Jo lifts it : \"Look, Giant, a magic rock weighting a thousand pounds!\". All the other party members try to lift it, acting like it's too heavy. Jo then picks it back up, and throw it as far as he can in the forest.\n\n\"Well then, go fetch it, and we'll see if you can throw it as far as me!\"\n\nRoll for smarts. The giant aint too bright, and he runs into the wood. We cross the river quickly, high-five each other.\n\nFast forward a couple games, we forget the giant, do what we have to do, and rush back toward the village. It seems like we're heading toward the final arc of the campaign. We see the river and...\n\nA certain rock flies, killing one of our horses.\n\n\"YOU ASSHOLES TRICKED ME.\"\n\nAww shit.\n\n\"NO MORE TRICKS AND GAMES. WE FIGHT WITH FISTS NOW.\"\n\nJo the Woodcutter approaches him, puffing his chest (Hindrance : Overconfident). Meanwhile, we desperately try to come up with a way to get out of this - Jo may be willing to fight, but he's probably not gonna make it.\n\nAnd he tried his best, but the best he could do is bruise the giant. In the end, he got literally pounded into the ground. The strongest among us is now unconscious. What do we do?\n\nWell, the solution is so simple, no one argued about my idiot naive farmer coming up with it.\n\n\"Well gosh darnit, giant, you beat us fair and square. I guess we can't go on the other side of the river. Come on guys, lets pick up Jo and go back home.\"\n\nThe GM, laughing, roll to see if the giant picks up on what's happening. Nope.\n\nThe giant just stood there, arm crossed and grinning proudly, while we lifted up Jo's body, crossed back the river, and continued toward the village.",

        "text": "My DM set a 3.5 game in a world destroyed by demons where survivors lived in the subway underneath Berlin.\n\nMy first character had died early in the campaign after, mostly, piecing together an antagonists reasons for being ... well an antagonist (a famous singer who scarred her more beautiful sister &amp; tampered with her memories to forget she ever had a vocal talents). The score was 0 - 1 in my DM's favour at this point &amp; I was ready to screw with them big time.\n\nMy new character in this horrible world was a paladin, S. Fynn (the S stood for Susan but he knew no one would take a Susan seriously so the party &amp; DM never got to know his first name) &amp; he was paladin of Coca-Cola, considering people had been living underground for roughly 300 years the old Gods were more or less forgotten &amp; new religions popped up all the time &amp; Coke ads were everywhere before the fall so of course people would come to honour the ads and the neon signs &amp; everything ... Fynn was clad in red &amp; white plate as well with his holy symbol being a tiny Coke bottle on a necklace.\n\nThe campaign went on with the party finding a station with a guild of people who explored the surface, a place few went to because of the demons who now inhabited the space &amp; even if you could kill one they would only be reformed in their own realm before coming back to our own. Fynn's holy powers were a great use and the guild took in the party. \n\nAfter months of missions and trying to deal with the Nazi and Soviet factions who also inhabited certain stations in the Underground the party had their magical NPC who could barely speak but was a source of great magically energy &amp; healing (pretty much a giant magic battery in the form of a woman with the intelligence of a small child) stolen by the Nazis.\n\nWe spent 80% of a session (like 4 hours) planning our way into the Nazi research station where we had learned our NPC had been taken. After finally making it to our NPC in our next session we saw what they wanted her for, they wanted to use her as a battery to power their magic guns &amp; other items so they could finally control all of the Underground. A fight with Nazi cannon fodder and &amp; very powerful and annoying sorcerer began.\n\nPart way through the fight my desire to finally even up the score with my DM hit me, Fynn noticed the sorcerer was protecting the device (an exercise ball sized glowing orb) that they had attached to our magical NPC. I diverted my attention to it and started smashing it with my holy Coca-Cola sword, the sorcerer blew back the rest of the party and wanted me off this orb immediately and warned me not to destroy the orb. I had gotten myself on top of it and plunged my sword into it.\n\nThe DM has warned us this was a dangerous mission and that there was going to be a lot of chances for our characters to perish.\n\nThe orb exploded, as it was being used to siphon the magical energy stored in our NPC into itself. This explosion was the deadliest thing our DM had put into the encounter &amp; never expected it to actually happen as the explosion was powerful enough to destroy the entire Nazi station and blow straight to the surface and pierce a hole in the dark skies that had overtaken the world since the demons first emerged. In an instant I had killed the boss we were struggling to defeat but also wiped the entire party &amp; made a giant new hole for demons to come into the Underground and feast on what was left of the races. \n\nI had finally evened up the score 1 - 1 with my.\n\nEveryone else got their lives retconned &amp; could either make a new character or play an undead version of their old heroes, Fynn was exempt from this option.\n\nThis was by far the best jab I've ever made at my GM by making him have to redesign the majority of the structure in our world &amp; think of ramifications for the event. Considering Fynn went down in our group's history books as one of my stupidest characters (he also got carpet fused to the bottom of his boots when he was teleported into someone's manner to assassinate them for a civil revolt &amp; forever blamed the fused carpet on being attacked by a carpet demon) I felt very accomplished &amp; was able to sit back for the rest of the campaign &amp; was the right hand player in making sure everyone else got to have their magnum opus moment in the story.\n\nIn the end the score with my DM will forever be in his favour but I love the moments when I can turn the cruel worlds he builds for us back on him in any small way.",

        "text": "So my DM decided to make a 3.5 game set in a demon-destroyed Germany, where the world had been taken over by monstrous demons who stalked the rubble that was left of society and those who had survived the outbreak lived underground, in the subway system under Berlin.\n\nMy character was Elias the Dwarven Monk (who probably wasn't a good choice for a campaign that used A LOT of guns) who had a -1 to charisma. The party had managed to impress a traveling side-show that owned a very rare commodity in the Underground, a working train. Wanting to fit in with the company Elias decided to show off his own entertaining skills, his dancing, I rolled a 1 and with the -1 charisma it was a zero. The leader of said side-show found this funny and accepted Elias as a kooky old fool with a young pack of capable adventurers.\n\nAs the days passed and the group traveled from station to station getting work with the locals and helping with the show Elias made the discovery that something was not right with the side-show's leader, a woman who was a famous country singer, &amp; the train's maintenance worker, an even more beautiful woman who had been heavily scarred who also had a wonderful voice. Elias did what he did best and stuck his nose in where it didn't belong.\n\nAfter confronting the train's leader about this all and making the connection that the leader and then maintenance worker must of been something like sisters and the scarring on the maintenance worker was an act of jealousy &amp; that this maintenance woman must of had her memory altered in someway to forget about her own vocal talent &amp; the assault. The leader paid off Elias not to dig any deeper into this.\n\nThe following day a young man who was smitten with the train's leader invited Elias to the rear of the train to have a smoke, the young man booted Elias off the back of the moving train. Elias was stranded and eventually died trying to fight off the horrors that lived in the branching tunnels connected to the main subway.\n\nI've always loved trying to add the DM into the game a little more, making his NPCs have PCs who want to know more &amp; care about their stories. My DM also knows that I love to \"board the bad idea train\" &amp; turn everything he has planned or other characters desire upside down in an instant. So this was my first character casualty in this campaign, the score being 0 - 1 in favour of my DM but my next character was my secret weapon.",

        "text": "First post here, and on mobile, so forgive me for mistakes.\n\nFor those of you who aren't familiar with Starfinder, it is the science fiction variant of Pathfinder.\n\nDramatis Personae:\n&gt;Me- Twigs T'sol the Shirren Technomancer. Imagine a big bug alien wearing a mechanic's jumpsuit.\n&gt;The Cat(inside joke)- Ruza the Vesk Soldier. Big, muscular iguana-man with a big gun and combat armor.\n&gt;Ian- Cayden-66 the android Operative. I actually can't remember what he looked like, I just know he has a huge anti-material rifle.\n&gt;Dan- GM\n\n&gt;The three of us wake up in a prison cell, without our gear, not knowing where we are. Twigs begins looking around the room, Shirren being a naturally curious race, trying to remember what had happened. Ruza is glancing around cautiously, as he is surrounded by strangers who may be hostile. Cayden appears to be thinking deeply, finally standing up.\n\n&gt; \"Welp, might as well.\" He says, extending a hand to Twigs, \"Cayden-66.\" Twigs shakes his hand, \"Twigs T'soll, nice to meet you.\" he replies cheerfully. \"And you, big guy?\" Cayden asks Ruza, pointing his open hand at him. \"Ruza.\" He replies in a gruff tone, without shaking his hand.\n\n&gt; After introductions, the three started comparing what they know, trying to piece together how they got here. Not long after, a drow wearing some kind of uniform approaches the cell door and opens it, stepping inside. For God knows what reason, Ruza takes this as an opportunity to escape and lunges at the guard. He didn't get the jump on him though, and promptly gets the shit tazed out of him. The drow curses, spits on him, then leaves, the cell door shutting behind him.\n\n&gt; \"I'm not sure that was the wisest course of action.\" Twigs says to him as he slinks back to the bench to sulk. Cayden then chuckles and presents something in his hand. He had managed to pickpocket a keycard off of the guard during the commotion. \"Think this will help?\" He asks smugly as he approches the door. Twigs then stops and blocks him, gesturing to a camera they hadn't noticed before.\n&gt; They were stuck now. Cayden tried to think up some plans while Twigs pondered some options. He perks up a little, and without saying anything he creates a holographic image of them in the cell in front of the camera. \"That's handy.\" Cayden says, and attempts to use the card to open the door. He can't quite reach the reader though, and there's no way Ruza's meaty arms will fit through the bars, so they were stuck again.\n\n&gt; Twigs now chuckles and conjures a mage hand to take the card out of Cayden's hand and open the door. He steps out into the hallway and looks over his shoulder at the other two. \"Will that be all?\"\n\nThere's more to tell, but this is already kind of long, so I'll post a part two if you guys want.\n",

Eventually my \"leadership\" resulted in us crash landing on a back-water planet trying to escape some bandits I had pissed off &amp; our ship was utterly destroyed. I had been acting with the good of myself &amp; my daughter in mind rather than the party for some time by this point. An NPC in the party (our pilot) knew of ships that were left on this planet by his people in ancient times, my character had harassed this pilot for some time and made him the butt of her jokes &amp; harassment on numerous occasions. When I refused to do as this pilot suggested because I was the captain the pilot asked what the rest of the party thought, the party agreed with the pilot (knowing he was being the rational one) &amp; said I could with them if I let them destroy my murder-bot daughter as her growing strange behaviour was making them feel very unsafe and nervous.\n\nWith everything laid out I drew my thermal-pistol &amp; threatened them because of their mutiny. I stood between the party and my daughter which lead to me being shot down in a gruesome manner. My daughter burst into tears and huddled over my lifeless corpse, the pilot took this opportunity to shoot her through the head. \n\nThe party flew off the planet with their ancient, abandoned alien ship with the final shot of the session being my body, with my daughter's body collapsed on top of me, in pools of my blood and her robot-fluids.\n\nThis character was lost after a year and a half of play and was my first ever character loss in the 3 years I had been playing tabletop games at that point. I legitimately cried after we ended the session that night and were just doing our usual talk afterwards on how we thought everything went.\n\nI would love to hear about anyone else's saddest character losses, whether it be a good end to their story or an RNG moment that stole their life.",

        "text": "Loot, EXP, power, three things a good number of players only care about, and it can sometimes be a problem with new people at my table, not often, but it's sometimes the case. One in particular was a rather chill and shy guy, who had a mind like a super computer when it came to tactical combat. So when it came to making his first character, he knew he didn't want to roleplay, though he was perfectly fine to sit back and watch. In the end we helped make him an android barbarian, 3 wis, 3 int, 3 cha, max everything else.\n\nThis guy was one of the other characters bodyguard, a tool left behind by his master, a prototype creation for...something, the apprentice never found out, and the android did not have access to that information in his data banks. The two of them escaped their old home and went wondering, trying to find a new place to set up shop when they joined the caravan that the rest of the group were part of...and were also rendered homeless when said caravan was raided by crazed elementals.\n\nSome adventuring here, some plundering there, and everyone's role in the group is established, with the android, eventually named Denton (because they have a terrible sense of humor), becoming the defacto fist of the group. He also became the teams lockpick, or rather, lockpunch, because it was incredibly rare for them to encounter a door that he couldn't outright rip off its hinges. As was the case with their first real home, the lair of a cult they had slaughtered down to the last man, with only the 'future sacrifices' still alive. Among them was a young girl, small thing, frail to. She had been offered to the cult so a caravan heading to Roskom could pass because she was sickly anyway, and it took one look from the cleric to confirm she had cancer of the blood, something that cannot be healed at that stage of the game (You're looking at permanent shape shifting spells, wish and reincarnation to solve it at my table).\n\nWhile the rest of the people were allowed to leave, the girl, and a few others decided to stay since they had no where else to go, and together with the party, they cleared out the hillside hideout, fixed it up and started to recruit dwarves to help fortify the interior and slowly make their own dungeon. Meanwhile Denton was left to his own musings, never really interacting with anyone, partly because he was barely able to in the first place, but when asked what he'd like to do, he went to visit the girl. protocol dictated that he watch over his master and those designated as 'under protection', so he went to make sure she was still ok before taking up a post in her room, one of the few with a view. She asked him little questions, simple things like what he was, where did he come from, so on so forth. Then he asked me, the DM, if he could ask her something.\n\nDue to the way his character was built, I had him roll a wisdom save just to muster the individuality required to have such a degree of independence for a time, the DC was low enough for him to pass, and he asked what her name was, Samantha. He didn't need to roll anymore to ask any questions, again, following the trend of simple things before he got called away to help his master. This was his routine for a time, guarding her when not helping the rest of the group or being out on their regular escapades. Eventually he decided to move into the same room as her to watch over her easier and whenever required to put his fabrication skills to good use, he sat there and talked to her. He wasn't trying to find out who was making the elementals go haywire, or find the fae who cursed his family, he was just Denton, bonding with a dying girl.\n\nWhen she finally died in the night, asleep and curled up in dentons lap after she asked to feel what it was like to be hugged, I had denton make another will save in order for him to have the ability to cry. Without a word, he buried her body and told the rest of the party when they woke up, much to their surprise, especially when the first thing out of his mouth when they asked him where he had been was \"Burying samanthas corpse.\"\n\nFrom then on he felt like he could speak up a little more, but he never really interacted with anyone outside of the main group, even then there was still this barrier he felt like he had to break through before he could really emote or anything, but he was trying. The only time he was truly forced to express himself was during a fight against a horde of golems, something which had previously never even paid him any attention until he attacked them first in combat. He was targeted just as much as everyone else now, for some unknown reason, and he was also the last one standing after the combat encounter, everyone else knocked out or bleeding to death from blunt force trauma. Through quick thinking and logic, he realized the only way to get everyone out of there after killing the last golem, was to stuff the dead bodies into the bag of holding after dismembering them, hefting the rest onto his shoulders, and booking it to the nearest town two days away to have them all healed. By the time he broke down the door to the Roskom church, the only things he could say were 'save my friends' and 'please, i don't want to see anyone else die again.'\n\nThey all get healed up, Denton gets repaired by his once master now best friend, and they try to piece together the plot while Denton is sat wondering why he woke up the next day without that strong emotional sensation that he felt the day before, the same sort of thing he felt after samantha died. While everyone else talked and healed, he went out as per the head of the churches request to do some shopping and escort one of the clerics with him. They ducked into a busy market street and slowly plodded their way through, buying what they could and even picking up the odd magical knick knack with the parties funds, until they got to the hat shop.\n\nOne thing the church needed was some additional ceremonial hats for their initiates, so it was a stop along the way. The cleric with Denton got to talking with the owners wife, who approached him to gossip about roadlife travel, mentioning she and her husband had came through a mountain pass not long ago where their young daughter had died in a raid by cultists. I'll never forget the look Dentons player gave me that day, or the words that followed 'She died because you abandoned her, she died because of your carelessness while plying your trade, she died in my arms.'. He went to punch her, but i told him to make a will save, to break his own limitations and show emotion again. The womens jaw was shattered by the blow, the same went for the husband before he told the cleric everything he knew.\n\nSadly the justice system did not look upon this behaviour kindly and he was sentenced to jail time with bail, which he was able to pay for and avoid, but only let out after there were guards placed near the hat makers house for safety. When he was able to return to the church, he told everyone else what had happened and we called the session there before I handed him an entirely revised character sheet for Denton. 6 Wis, 6 int, 6 Cha, just enough of a boost for him to make him just able enough to try his hand at bluff, diplomacy and intimidate rolls, along with his new alignment marked on the sheet, chaotic good.\n\nThey never bothered with the hat makers after that, continuing on their way to finish their main quest. Not as 3 wild souls and a shell, but 4 men standing side by side.\n\nSidenote: The wisdom save roll I had him do every time was DC 1, put there to give him a barrier to work through mechanically, to give a game action to someone who isn't used to roleplaying so they felt like the reward for it was the roleplay, but so low that he'd pass pretty much every time. It was in place to tie into the thematics of his character being something without emotion having to break a barrier to have an emotion and become human. Not me trying to stop him from rping, just saying this now.",

        "text": "This is the story of currently three students attending a highschool in Neo Toronto called Bravo Academy, a specially designed facility to help superpowered Novahuman teens control their powers as well as get a good education.\n\n[Previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/8v90np/mutants_and_masterminds_3e_bravo_academy_part_8/), Sean, Alistair and Kayla do their best to return to classes as normal. With the Powers Display and Homecoming Dance formally announced, excitement can be felt around the school. After surviving a gym class with Golden Conqueror, the group go about their day and socialise with Jonathan, Cara and Jose, where Alistair finds out Jonathan will also be partaking in the fighting tournament during the Powers Display. The following morning the group attend Danger Room Club with Andrew and Tila, and pit Alistair in a simulation against a Xenomorph.\n\nPlayers were awarded one Power Point for their efforts, and at the start of the seventh session, their Hero Points reset to 1 each.\n\n*Thus, we move onto our next adventure:*\n\nAfter Danger Room Club ends and the trio depart, they make their way over to the ferry to meet up with Jonathan, Jose, Cara and Martha, who had also decided to come along for the day. Together, they were lead by Kayla through downtown Neo Toronto towards the city megamall.\n\nThe Neo Toronto Megamall was essentially a city district by itself, sitting in the bustling downtown area of the city, four blocks long, three wide and five stories high, the open plan building was a maze of commerce that proved to be a hot spot for both civilian and novahuman needs.\n\nMoving through the crowded entrances, the group find a spot and discuss shops they need to head to. Alistair, not needing anything from the Supers section, says he just needs to find a grocery store to refill the fridge, Jose says he wanted to check out a game store while he was here and the rest say they just need to grab things from the supers section.\n\nPlan agreed, Alistair heads off to the grocery store while the rest find the nearby PlayHalt to browse the games there. The store’s size is truly massive, with various sections across all generations of gaming and even having an arcade in one corner. After games are acquired, Sean spies a CCU (Crump Crump Uprising) station, and challenges others in the group to play, Jose being the only one to take up the challenge.\n\nSean’s speed provides a decent advantage, allowing him to gain a substantial amount of points on the highest difficulty. Stepping from the stage, Sean passes the baton to Jose, who decides to throw caution to the wind, loading up two machines and being prepared to play both. Ultimately, while he does an admirable job, his combined scores don’t beat Sean’s though no stakes were made.\n\nWhile the group head over to the superhero portion of the mall, Alistair is picking up his groceries. While there, he bumps into Rachel again, who unlike Alistair is shopping for ready meals and microwavable food instead of actual ingredients. When Alistair expresses disappointment in this, Rachel feigns horror at the prospect of having a romantic homemade meal made by Alistair. Alistair rebukes this, but Rachel simply wanders off laughing, much to the Brit boy’s frustration.\n\nBack with the others, they find themselves in the section of the mall catered entirely to superheroics and similar efforts. As said before, normally the Mad Science Effect causes those who excel in super sciences and technology to kind of retain their signature style, simply because some unknown force or psychological quirk prevents them from sharing the design or implementation of their technology with the world, hence why flying cars, interdimensional doorways or even commercial spaceflight aren’t readily available even with the Steel Kings, Dr. Terawatts or Fratmeisters of the world; their tech couldn’t be replicated or even taught, and they were the only ones able to effectively use it. However, back in the 80s when MSE was formally theorised and given a name, and more technology based heroes and villains reared their heads, many governments began shifting their budgets to the fields of Science and Medicine allowing them to try and keep up as best they could, and ‘regular’ scientists and inventors themselves would be more open to experimentation and proliferation just to see if they either had discovered something within humanity’s ‘pace’ of development, or could claim to have an ego boost of being ‘so smart they were affected by MSE’.\n\nThis allowed the year 2020 to be slightly more advanced than what the regular world would potentially be, with electric, self-driving cars being not only perfected but also the standard, molecular machines to serve as supplements to regular vaccines and antibodies, magnetic, borderline warp tech used as kinetic dampeners for safety bumpers, and most prosthetics are bionic rather than mechanical or plastic. While not miles ahead, the world has gotten further than what one might expect by the turn of the decade, and allowed for the business of being above-board suppliers for heroes that lacked the smarts, but could benefit from the additional gear to acquire it in a law abiding, capitalist-enabling fashion without government registration or the need for theft or potential danger (though video tutorials online definitely exist, with... mixed results.)\n\nHence, the superheroics wing of the Megamall, with branches specifically for various methods of heroics, and some extra security thrown in for good measure. Kayla, having been here before, heads for ‘Charlie’s’, a general store run by the eponymous Charlie, a fairly unassuming man. On the way, Jonathan breaks off from the group to head into a dark looking magic shop while Jose immediately trails off to head into an Invoked Inc. Store. While in Charlie’s, Sean and Cara pick up some basic jumpsuits and aerodynamic backpacks for their role in emergency and rescue, and Kayla picks up an LED mask to adjust her already acquired technology. Martha also picks up a targeting monocle to aid in her own projectile power.\n\nAfter some time, everyone reconvenes and returns to the school, joining the group in their dorm for some food prepared by Alistair.\n\nTime passes, and the Powers Display comes around.\n\nThe morning of the event, while the rest of the school prepared itself for the influx of heroes, alumni and families, our trio of hopeful heroes are pulled into the principal’s office, though they find enough time to have a decent breakfast as always.\n\nHeading inside, they encounter an interesting sight. Besides Dr. Langford, three other individuals are in the room, all recognisable, though one the group had already met. Alongside Voltaic Vanguard was a tall, sharp-chinned Caucasian male in an open leather jacket, which was over a form-fitting spandex shirt, baggy cargo pants and knee high boots adorned his legs and his face was covered by a half-mask, all in forest greens and whites.  On his chest was an L in the centre of an atom, the symbol of Legend.\n\nNext to him was a figure in power armour, the suit sleek and simple, which was a good thing considering the confined space. The plates were shiny and would subtly move and shift, a slight yellow glow emanating between the gaps. There is the impression of a crown on the helmet of Steel King.\n\nThe group, truly starstruck, remain appropriately quiet as their principal introduces the three Justiciars, though Voltaic Vanguard remains as casual as she ever is. It is, however, a discussion with purpose, and no time is wasted.\n\nWith the attack on the school, Alistair’s own displays of power and other contributing factors, the world’s premiere hero team is growing concerned with the fate of the school, as well as its students. Alistair, Sean and Kayla were all prominent players in this game that seemed to be going on, but they didn’t want to pull them out of school into a full sidekick program; such things were discouraged, especially if the children in question were already in a school catering to their powers, and taking them into sidekick duty would potentially stunt their ability to land a civilian job without going public with their identities.\n\nLegend says that while Nightwraith investigates leads on a possible puppet master orchestrating the attack at the school, a Justiciar will be spending time in Neo Toronto just to be sure.\n\nThere was some checking in, primarily by Vanguard about how the group were doing, and what they were expecting at the Powers Display today. The three heroes were there chiefly to act as guests of honour and put their stamp of approval on the school, that the event was there to prove to any other idiot villains that the school itself was filled with capable, brave students and staff, and they weren’t going to just roll over and take it lightly.\n\nWishing them a good show, the Justiciars sent the group off to prepare for the display while they remained to go over other details with Dr. Langford.\n\nThe Powers Display was being held on the school sports field, with the bleachers extended and some of the danger room tech being brought out to the field for use. The crowd was already quite dense, as a sea of off duty heroes, non-competing students, alumni and families found their places in the stands. For families unable to attend in person, secure N7 connections to livestreams were provided, protected by various technopaths and computer masters, along with Spirit.\n\nKayla spent the opening moments with those techheads, while Sean busied himself in one of his three duties; handing out snacks. Meanwhile, Alistair prepares to psyche himself up for the fighting tournament. Gar’s participation was inevitable, as was Jonathan’s but the fourth entrant was largely unknown.\n\nAlistair heads out onto the stage, very much the same concrete platform found in nearly all shonen combat tournaments, with the rules being yield, knock out or ring out.  Around the brit, the crowd cheers and applauds as he wanders out, though he remains professional during the entrance, even as the announcer calls out his name.\n\nBehind him, his opponent wanders sheepishly onto the stage. Cara Jameson looks about her surroundings and waves a little, not used to the attention. Her presence comes, undoubtedly as a surprise for all involved, but Alistair prepares for a battle all the same, and Cara herself seems fairly determined to take part.\n\nWith the terms of combat made known, the fighters in their positions and the crowd on edge, the buzzer sounds and the fight begins, the red protective field forming over the two of them to prevent too much damage.\n\nCara, as it turns out, is much like Golden Conqueror, in that her powerset was largely that of the Paragon Archetype, consisting of flight, super strength, durability and energy blasts. To her benefit, this allows her to withstand a number of Alistair’s core attacks, despite her opponent’s clearly superior skill. The two would trade blows, Cara not being able to land a hit and Alistair not really being able to hit with lasting damage.\n\nWhat turned the tide of this fight was, in truth, Cara’s own weakness. Her energy blasts took a lot out of her to fire, causing her to gain a stage of exhaustion every time she used them. While she tried to use her flight to allow a potential ring out victory, after using her blasts twice and failing both times, she was too tired to actively put up much of a fight, and Alistair managed to score a ring out himself.\n\nSean, now aiding in first response, rushes out to make sure Cara is OK, and thankfully she is, with neither student having suffered too many wounds. Alistair is cheered off the field and Cara goes to relax and prepare to be part of first response with Sean.\n\nWhile Alistair awaits his spot in the finals, he watches the match between Gar and Jonathan on screen. Well, when I say Match, I mean inconvenience. While Gar is overtly powerful, Jonathan’s own control allows him to simply bypass Gar’s own defences with near ease, trapping the plasma kid in stone and levitating it outside the ring.\n\nThere’s a level of awe among the audience as the match is over more or less before it began and the mage wanders off to ‘rest’ after dismissing the bindings on Gar, who is barely able to restrain himself from simply attacking. With Alistair now having seen a glimpse of Jonathan’s capabilities first hand, his curiosity continues to grow.\n\nAfter a brief intermission, Alistair and Jonathan were lead out to the arena. Wishing each other luck, the two prepare for battle. While Alistair took a defensive stance, Jonathan took a deep, cordial bow. As he did so, the air around him became frighteningly cold, and his body began to freeze over, forming long claws, curled horns and thin wings of supernatural ice. With a voice an octave lower, he welcomed Alistair to make the first move. Smiling, Alistair knew Jonathan could be the challenge he wanted, and with a successful Will Save, he let loose.\n\nThe fight was supremely impressive, the two top freshmen bouncing through the air and slinging lightning bolts and arcane blasts at each other. Even still, the fight was more a challenge for Jonathan than for Alistair; even with the ice demon, the mage was still only PL 8, while Alistair’s abilities had been boosted to PL 12. Nothing Jonathan could cast could hit, much less hurt Alistair, and he even had to resort to making spells up on the fly just to keep the storm at bay.\n\nThen Alistair let loose a full powered, power attack Air Canon, a DC 39 toughness save under normal circumstances. The smoke and debris filled the entire stadium, leaving there to be a tense pause as onlookers wondered if the poor Transylvanian boy had been atomised. Instead, as the smoke cleared, Alistair saw a shimmering green field before him, on the otherside of which, hand raised was a very disappointed looking Legend, the final sight before the brit burned out and collapsed in exhaustion.\n\nWe’ll just have to wait and see what happens next.",

        "text": "Pathfinder character story time!\n\nThough he was the 16th son of Blokk Bloodripper, chieftain of the Bloodripper tribe, Krokk Bloodripper was never a very good orc. He disliked roughhousing with his brothers, who were substantially larger and more aggressive, preferring to spend time with his sisters, who were also large and aggressive, but less so than his brothers.\n\nOn every Bloodrippers’ 8th birthday, aspiring warriors embark into the wilderness, alone and naked, to hunt the largest creature they could handle (or not handle) sometimes for days or weeks. Drokk, the chieftain’s favorite son, had disappeared for no less than two months, returned covered in gore, triumphantly whooping, and waving the head of a full size grey render for all to see. Krokk thought it wasn’t that impressive.\n\nKrokk halfheartedly resolved to give this initiation the old college try, but after an hour of dirt and mosquitos, he decided this task was beyond him, and settled for bringing back a single dire toad. His family was less than enthused with his offering.\n\nBerated by his father and mocked by his siblings, Krokk went off to drown his sorrows in the tribe’s ale storehouse. After a few fortifying beverages, he found the “orc courage” his father so desperately desired, and beverage in hand, stumbled into his father’s tent.\n\nThe speech given by Krokk was long, rambling, and mostly incoherent, but choice phrases included “why do all our names \\*hic\\* have to rhyme?” and “But it was a DIRE toad- when Mokk brought back that DIRE bear, you said \\*hic\\* that it took a true warrior to hunt a DIRE beast.” Blokk considered his son’s points, and responded with a head-butt he had been practicing on a large rock.\n\nKrokk awoke in the livestock pen, manacled, bruised, and desperately in need of a glass of water. He was greeted by a kick to the ribs from Drokk, who politely informed Krokk that unless he vacated the tribe within the hour, he would be given a new, exciting position testing the tribe’s latest batch of stolen armaments. With his body. Krokk considered the offer, and agreed to that this career path was not for him.\n\nThough aching and thoroughly dehydrated, Krokk assembled a survival pack and set off into the world, heartfelt jeers and kicks thrown to him all the while from his loving siblings.\n\nFiguring he may not be very good at being an Orc, Krokk decided to give human settlements a go. He knew of a large fortified one a few leagues away, and decided to check it out, having little to lose.\n\nThe journey was long, arduous, filled with bugs, and smelly, but Krokk ventured on, eventually making it to the gate of the human settlement starving, weary, and desperately in need of a bath.\n\nThe town guard were unsure of what to do with the desperate adolescent orc, but after a thorough mind-reading from a psion, concluded his babblings were true, and allowed Krokk in.\n\nThere is little opportunity for orcs in general, never mind ones who can’t fight, but Krokk still found human civilization much more to his liking than orc tribalism. For one thing, they cooked their meat and didn’t greet people with kicks. After a few days on the streets, he even found dutiful employment moving shipments of books from the town docks to the local scribes’ guild.\n\nKrokk became quite enamored with the scribes, who said funny new words like “please”, never yelled, occasionally gave him money for fetching things, and spent their time pouring over scrolls. He eventually pulled aside a kindly older scribe, and asked him how one could become like him.\n\nThe older scribe took a curious look at Krokk, and told him that if he was really interested in record keeping, he could provide some night lessons. Krokk had never accepted quicker in his life.\n\nDespite his poor educational background, Krokk proved a quick study, and soon spent more time with his mentor than moving crates. His mentor viewed him first as a curiosity, but eventually a promising student. When Krokk mastered the notoriously difficult draconic script, he declared the young orc a prodigy, and promptly hired him as a personal attendant.\n\nKrokk had never been happier. He was surrounded by quite, polite people, spent most of his time inside a well heated library, and found he had a knack for languages. Realizing his brutal orc background would be a detriment in his new environment, he adopted the moniker Chauncey, as well as a posh accent to better fit in.\n\nWithin 3 years, Chauncey Drokkson’s rising star could no longer be ignored. Despite lacking a formal education, he applied for a temporary assistant junior undersecretary position with some encouragement from his mentor. Chauncey would later debate whether his successful application, encounter with the old scribe, or exile from his tribe was the best thing that ever happened to him.\n\nThough Chauncey’s orc heritage initially ruffled some feathers, his undeniable skill, polished manners, and ability to brew an exceptional pot of tea won his colleagues over. By the time he was 17, he secured a position as junior undersecretary for the ministry of roads and non-magical transportation, and was a full member of the scribes’ guild.\n\nChauncey’s talents began to attract regional interest. Two years after his appointment as junior undersecretary, he was offered a fast-track promotion to senior undersecretary in a neighboring kingdom. After bidding his mentor and friends in the guild a tearful farewell, he set out for a new place for the second time in his life, this time without head-butts and kicks.\n\nChauncey found his new home quite to his liking. Being an orc attracted attention, but he was a good scribe who genuinely enjoyed his job, and won over his colleagues as he had in his previous post. His life was comfortable and head-butt free, and there were even veiled rumors of potential promotion to permanent undersecretary in the king’s palace.\n\nAll of this came crashing down on a particularly dreary late night at the office. Chauncey was proofing a particularly interesting series of reports on gravel surpluses in the west (yes Chauncey was THAT boring) when he accidentally spilled tea on his lap. No one was more surprised than Chauncey when the adjacent deputy minister of quarries and minerals eyebrows’ spontaneously combusted.\n\nA terrified Chauncey was promptly hauled to the city jail, and spent the night in an isolated magical containment cell. After a quick evaluation by the local mage’s guild, Chauncey was discovered to be a latent wild magic sorcerer, and promptly deemed a workplace hazard until such a time that the mages’ guild deemed him safely in control of his talent.\n\nChauncey views this discovery as horrible initially, but became increasingly excited as a mage representative began describing some basic spells to him. An invisible telekinetic hand to move papers and quills about, small fires to heat tea, even enchantments to make light for particularly late nights? He would become the most efficient scribe in the kingdom.\n\nChauncey chose to pursue a six month journeyman’s program at the mage’s guild, figuring he would learn enough in the cozy guild hall to be deemed safe for work and then return to his posting with the scribes’. Unfortunately, for poor Chauncey, the master he was assigned to was a trailblazing sort who had spent his youth with party of like-minded adventurers spelunking into forgotten dungeons. After a crash course in the fundamentals of magic, he signed up poor Chauncey with the dungeoneering guild for some field experience.\n\nChauncey tried to protest. He had seen dungeoneering casualty reports from colleagues in the department of archaeology, and had no desire to return to the wilderness he had worked so hard to get away from. He desperately petitioned his mentor for literally any other assignment, but was rebuffed with assurances that “some time out in the field would be a reprieve from all that time in the office.”\n\nWith a heavy heart, Chauncey the Workplace Hazard purchased the most durable looking adventuring gear he could find, gathered up his second best quill and parchment set, and headed for the dingy tavern he was scheduled to meet his group. As he entered the tavern, he was assaulted by riotous laughter and drunken japes on all sides, as well as a faint aroma similar to old shoes. A grizzled looking man covered in the iconography of Pelor, across from a smaller hooded figure, looked up and waved to Chauncey.\n\nChauncey walked slowly over, noting that both the halfing and the cleric had picked up the bar’s unpleasant odor of feet and stale alcohol. Pointedly NOT wrinkling his nose, he smiled and introduced himself to the two men, who identified themselves as Gregor of Pelor (it took every ounce of Chauncey’s self-control not to roll his eyes) and Vince Underhill.\n\n“We’re gonna have a real great old time together, friend,” said Gregor, with a grin and hearty slap on Chauncey’s back, “Our fourth gets a bit squeamish around magic and whatnot, but we figured you two would be perfect together, seeing as you’re both orcs!” \n\n“Both orcs?” said Chauncey, remembering the endless bullying from his siblings.\n\n“Yup” said Gregor, with a laugh “Don’t worry, he’s a great guy, but you know… tribal barbarians!”\n\nThe pit in Chauncey’s stomach turned as he remembered HIS experience with tribal barbarians.\n\n“Look, there he is now!” laughed Gregor, oblivious, “Chauncey, meet-“\n\n“I know who you are,” a deep guttural voice made Chauncey jump.\n\nA scarred hand missing two fingers, but with a grip like iron closed on Chauncey’s shoulder. Chauncey stared behind him into a leering, scarred, but all-too-familiar face.\n\n“You got fat, nerd.” Said Drokk Bloodripper, tombstone-like teeth contorting into a grin “I figured you’d ended up getting eaten by rabbits or something- or a TOAD!”\n\nAs his long estranged brother laughed, Chauncey blanched. He wasn’t sure what his best day was, but this was certainly, beyond all doubt, the worst.",

        "text": "A party in a low magic setting often times finds itself scrambling for good magic loot early on. It isn't uncommon in games I run for the players to have a lot of money by the time they hit level 3, but no magic items, if we are running a low magic game. So when the parties rogue (called Agrias) decides she wants her knife made into a magic item by the parties wizard, and they all chip in to get it done, that knife becomes that much more special to them.\n\nThe knife was something she, the player, convinced me to allow her to have from level 1, as it was a masterwork knife that had once belonged to her characters mother. It wasn't decorated or fancy, it was just very, very well crafted. It always added that small bonus needed for her to land that backstab, so much so that we took to calling it Lucky strike. But no matter how lucky a rogue is, even over confidence can get the better of them.\n\nDuring a fight against a up and coming organized crime lord in the city, the party had managed to push him right up to the rooftops of an isolated building after a hellishly long chase scene that in retrospective should have been shortened out. It was the party of five against the crimelord and his most loyal thugs, with it all going in the parties favour until the rogue got close to the leader. She got in and took a stab while the fighter harrowed him, but she missed, nat 1 missed, dropped her knife missed. Using a quick roll, I got the crimelord to pick up the knife in a bonus action while under threat of attacks of opportunity and gutted her, driving it right through the leather of her armour before being spartan kicked off the roof by the parties barbarian.\n\nThey gathered up her dead body and tried to get her revived at the local temple, but they were short on coin...about one enchanting of a daggers worth. The fighter, stricken with guilt about the affair, begged the others to let him keep the knife in memory of her, his best friend those past two months. From then on he abandoned his current build, and with my permission, retrained his feats so he could fight effectively with two weapons. That knife was the only off hand weapon he used.\n\nTime went by and most of them managed to come to terms with the death of their dear friend, and the fighter, even after passing level 5, still refused to use any other knife but that one in her memory.  So deep was his compulsion to never let that happen again and so tightly he clung to her.  The rest of the group slowly tried to help him out of his mental malady, to varying degrees of success, but only after the new cleric of the party (the new character of the rogue's player) sat down with him one hot summers evening as they watched the canal boats go by in the flooded old city below. They slowly worked though it, bit by bit, not fully during that night, but enough for him to smile again.\n\nThe next time they got into a fight, the knife seemed to land more attacks than it reasonably should have, even when the difference between AC and roll was 2. They went on for a few more fights before having the wizard identify it, but it had no inherently new magical properties. Without thinking much of it they kept going on...Until the fighter scored a crit after rolling a nat 1 for the knife after being pinned down by a druid in bear form, killing him instantly.\n\nWhile the mystery of the knife and the overraching plot continued, the fighter and the cleric kept on trying to work through his issues, slowly making progress until, finally, he was able to visit the grave they buried her in and cried there one final time. He never returned to the grave, he held her memory with him, not in the knife, but in his heart. As he left the grave, I handed him the knifes actual item description card. It stopped being a +1 dagger, it was a +2 dagger that allowed for two re-rolls per day, it was lucky strike, or as he had affectionately came to call it, Agrias.",

        "text": "I originally shared this over on r/DnD but then I remembered this sub and I figured you might get a kick out of it too.  Anyways...\n\nBackground: I'm the Dungeon Master (DM) for a party of 4 players - a male, half-elf paladin; a male, human ranger; a female, halfling warlock; and a female, halfling rogue. All are 3rd level. The two halflings are twin sisters in game.\n\nIn the last session, the party found a magic dagger that they thought was a simple +1 weapon. Unbeknownst to them it was a cursed ritual dagger that refuses to be unequipped (i.e., the rogue can't use any other weapon until a *Remove Curse* spell is cast on her - if she tries to use her rapier, she looks down and sees the dagger in her hand instead), and whenever the wielder does damage to a creature, they take half that amount of damage themselves. They could have figured this out sooner, but they didn't investigate the item very carefully, just accepting the +1 at face value.\n\nSo they head out for a week's journey to find out why people are disappearing at the local iron mines. On the way, they're attacked by some goblins and they discover that the dagger is cursed. Now they need to decide if they should turn back to town and find a cleric to remove the curse, or press onward and hope for the best. They decide to press on - maybe there will be a cleric at the iron mines.\n\nThey get to the mines but there's not cleric to be found. The rogue is stuck with the cursed dagger. They eventually find out that the disappearances are due to some pissed-off druids.\n\nSo the party is out in the woods hunting for these druids-gone-bad who have been attacking and killing people at the local iron mine. Your typical \"You're hurting the earth so we gonna kill you!\" type misguided druid stuff. After some searching and good tracking rolls by the party ranger, they come across the druids.\n\nFirst they try diplomacy, but the persuasion rolls are abysmal. Combat looks to be the only answer.\n\nIt's 4 level 3 PCs against 1 level 3 druid and 3 level 2 druids. But here's the thing about fighting druids - their wild shape ability really makes them hard to kill. Their wolf forms act as extra sources of hit points (hp) for them in the fight, and each druid can wild shape twice. And then there's the fact that the rogue is really hesitant to join in the battle, as each time she lands a hit, she takes half the damage herself.\n\nThe fighting commences.\n\nThe rogue quickly climbs a tree and tries to simply sit out the fight.\n\nThe others wade into the fray, slashing and smashing, spells flying. Druids are casting spells and in their wolf forms are ripping at the PCs (player characters). It's a tough fight, a few rounds go by with the PCs doing a lot of damage, but they're taking quite a bit themselves.\n\nThen the leader of the druids goes down.\n\nBut the PCs are still in a bad situation. The rogue decides that her friends and her sister won't survive without her aid, so she climbs down the tree and enters the fray.\n\nDamage is dealt all around. Everyone is bleeding badly. The rogue sees a nice opening and slips into position in order to gain flanking on her attack. She lashes out with the cursed dagger - a 21. She hits! Stabbing the druid in the jugular and doing a ton of sneak attack damage. The druid goes down.\n\nBut then the rogue feels the cold, piercing pain of a dagger in her own neck - her own cursed weapon, returning the blow upon her. Her hp drops to zero.\n\nThe rogue goes down.\n\nIt's now the paladin, the ranger, and the warlock against 2 druids.\n\nThere's a round of vicious fighting, damage dealt all around. The rogue rolls her first death save - 12, she passes. *(For those unfamiliar with D&amp;D 5e, when a character drops to 0 hp, they start making death saves - each round they roll a d20, a 10 or above is a success, below a 10 is a failure.  Three successes and you stabilize, three failures and you die)*\n\nThe fighting continues. The warlock casts Cloud of Daggers, the ranger swings and crits with his great club, and the paladin skewers a druid and drops him. But the rogue has to roll another death save - 7, fail.\n\nThe 3 standing PCs surround the last remaining druid and wail on him, but he's still standing after their attacks. The druid gathers his energy and slams his fist into the ground, releasing a Thunder Wave. All 3 PCs fail their constitution saves, all three are blasted back 10 feet, taking 13 damage. The paladin and the ranger both fall unconscious, and the warlock is left with a mere 4 hit points.\n\nNow it's the paladin's turn for a death save - 12, he passes.\n\nThe warlock squares herself against her resilient foe - it's just her and the druid, whoever lands the next hit will be the one to walk away. She calls on her mysterious patron and with a flash of hellfire and the burning scent of brimstone in the air, her Eldritch Blast slams the druid to the ground, killing the final foe.\n\nBut they're not out of the woods yet.\n\nThere are three unconscious PCs bleeding out on the ground. The round continues.\n\nThe ranger is next. Death save - 14. He passes.\n\nThen the rogue. Death save - 9. That's her second fail.\n\nPaladin's turn. Death save - 17. His second pass.\n\nThe warlock runs over the the rogue, her twin sister, her only remaining family member, who is now bleeding out from the wound in her neck, the wound caused by the rogue's own cursed dagger. The warlock tries to use her meager knowledge of medicine to stem the bleeding and stabilize her. She rolls a 4. Her efforts are in vain. She can't stop the bleeding.\n\nThe ranger rolls his next death save. A 17, his second pass.\n\nNow it's the rogue's turn. She rolls.\n\nIt's a 5.\n\nHer third failure.\n\nThe warlock looks on helplessly as her twin sister convulses and then goes still.\n\nThe paladin rolls another death save. 9. A failure.\n\nThe warlock shakes herself out of her shock, wipes away her tears, and runs to the paladin. Medicine check. Natural 20. He's stable.\n\nThe ranger rolls another death save. 5. Failure.\n\nThe warlock staggers over to him and tries to stem the bleeding. Medicine check - 12. He's stable.\n\nWith a mere 4 hit points remaining, the warlock was able to kill their final enemy and save her friends from death. But she couldn't save her sister, her twin. She had to watch as she bled out and died in her arms.\n\nAnd that's where we ended.",

        "text": "(Reuploaded from /r/DnD as I figured you'd enjoy it aswell)\n\n[Link for those unaware:](https://1d4chan.org/wiki/The_Henderson_Scale_of_Plot_Derailment)\n\nIt should be noted that if you're in an 1890's Wild West campaign hanging out with a trapper named Bobbert- you shouldn't be reading this post.\n\nTo jump right into it, the party (currently level 3) is made up of various bounty hunters and wanderers who, after meeting in the brothel/saloon-hybrid of one of the players, decided to investigate local reports of animalistic cannibals terrorizing the countryside. \n\nMaking a long story short, they eventually reached the conclusion that these attacks were the result of a nearby necromancer (later revealed to be an escaped African witchdoctor who originally created the zombies to break out of an illegal, slavery-operated plantation). \n\nAll the while, however, the players had been picking up on clues that a mysterious third party was also up to their own nefarious deeds. Multiple times, they would find themselves fighting ungodly mutated monsters that were created through some unknown (though detectable) school of magic. Some special, extremely powerful zombies even had traces of this magic ALONGSIDE necromancy- though it is doubtful that the players picked up on that specific detail. \n\nAfter finding and beating the everloving shit out of the necromancer, the party was able to ransack his lair; finding, among other things, a large wooden crate glowing with the spooky magic, a knife with the same characteristic, and an unfinished letter wedged in a typewriter.\n\nThe letter, quite obviously, appeared to be a shipping order of sorts between the necromancer and a cryptically named distributor who seemed to be the one responsible for supplying the crate. \n\nThe highlight of the letter, however, was supposed to be the necromancer explaining his concerns about the potency of the crate's contents; describing how individual grains of it diluted in water was enough to serve its purpose, and questioning the distributer's judgment to sell such large quantities of it.\n\nUnknownst to the players, this will (maybe at this rate) lead to a massive smuggling network that operates by shipping what is basically topsoil from a Lovecraftian dimension to otherwise D-tier villains. \n\nBack at town though, the party was recuperating from their heroic ass-kicking and eager to try their hand at less strenuous forms of investigation- such as conducting experiments on the ominous crate.\n\n**This is where the Henderson occurs.**\n\nNow, it should be noted that our party is no stranger to whole, entire Hendersons- let alone partial ones.\n\nOrphans have been accidentally burned alive, parties have been split between dimensions, etc. \n\nAll of these were understandable accidents, however. \n\nWhat made this one special was merely the absolute brazen, thoughtless nature of it.\n\nThe **lawful good** warlock immediately asked if there were any prisoners in the town jail.\n\nUpon being told there were, in fact, bad people available, it was requested by the warlock that the party be able to see them. \n\nOnce there, the warlock opened the crate of what appeared to be sand, and without hesitation, dumped it on a child molester. \n\n**ALL**\n\n**40**\n\n**POUNDS OF IT**\n\nThe spontaneous roar of IRL shock and disaproval from fellow party members was deafening. \n\nI sat in silent awe of the stupidity that had occurred.\n\nThe Monster Manual was fumbled through for a solid 3 minutes as I looked for something that came close to what was about to happen.\n\nI could've without question spawned something equal in stats to a hyrda, and could've made a pretty compelling argument for something equal in stats to a tarrasque. \n\nDespite that, I settled on something with a challenge rating of 5 because I'm not a douchebag. (Though I will have it grow larger over time if they forget about it)\nIn an instant, the jail was engulfed in a blinding ball of light; a massive, four-legged monstrosity of flesh, steel, and rock rising from its crater. \n\nThe party hopped on their horses and fled, leaving their starting town to crumble under the wrath of the contruct they had made. \n\nCurrently, they're hanging out with a small community of trappers and listening to rumors about the plight of refugees from neighboring settlements struggling to find proper shelter out on the open desert.\n\nNot sure where to go from here.\n\n**TL;DR: My party found themselves in possession of a Gatorade keg of T-virus, and dumped it all on a single person- turning their world into Attack on Titan.**\n\n",

        "text": "I have a character I play for Pathfinder Society who is an, air quotes, \"paladin\". He wears armor with a holy symbol of Saranrae on the chest, swings a big sword, tries to convert unbelievers, and \"smites\" things. I've even invested in multiple abilities that let me be more effective at subduing enemies instead of killing them, because it's hard to convert someone once they're a corpse.\n\nThing is... he's actually a NG Barbarian. All he wanted in life was to smite evil, but he got kicked out of paladin school for anger issues and a drinking problem - they weren't a fan when they found out his holy symbol had a flask built in to it. But he still tries to live up to most of the ideals, and while he is sometimes the object of a bit of mockery from actual divine casters and paladins, he is pretty effective at raging, yelling SMITE!, and then splitting evil into considerably smaller chunks of evil. Also, it should be noted that if anyone calls him on it in character - he never actually *claims* to be a Paladin. He's an independent knight in service to his goddess. It's not his fault if you get confused and thought he was one :)\n\nSo he's level 8 and with PFS being roughly 3 scenarios per level, he's fairly well known for his antics. We're fighting an evil dragon end boss of a scenario, who has tactics that dictate that if they see the battle looks unwinnable, they flee. We rush in and annihilate the dragon's minions and then ping it for a few minor hits. At this point, the dragon decides that while it's still in good shape, it's losing HP faster than we are, so it tries to flee.\n\nSince I'm in melee range, I get an attack of opportunity as it disengages; I'm also the only one, so we get one chance to try to stop this thing. Roll... Nat 20! Roll to confirm, and I'm pretty sure it's close, but I know it's not quite enough since a couple other people had missed with similar numbers.\n\nAt this point, I remember a trump card I'd been saving for several levels. At one point, he'd played a scenario where the PCs had been touched by a source of divine power, and a little bit of it still lingered - he had a boon that permitted him to, one time, for one round, draw on that power and invoke the Mythic version of a feat he had. I'd been saving it since it was a fairly rare and powerful boon, but it looked like it was time. I use the boon to gain Mythic Power Attack, which has three effects - it negates the attack penalty (which was -3 for me at this time), boosts the damage increase, and doubles the damage increase on a confirmed crit before applying the crit multiplier.\n\nSo the \"paladin\"'s sword suddenly blazes in holy light as he yells out \"SMITE!\" and slices down at the dragon. The GM confirms that yes, the +3 to the attack takes me from not confirming to confirming the crit. Roll my damage, just shy of 90 points, and it's just enough to take the dragon from well over half HP to barely negative. The rest of the party watches as the dragon slumps to the ground in a burst of light, the running joke of a \"paladin\" having seemingly genuinely smited a creature in one of the most dramatic ways possible.\n\nSo, Sir Vincent still drinks, and he still gets angry before punching evil really, *really* hard. However, while there's still a bit of joking, it's not like it was before. While he might not possess divine casting, or his goddess' protective aura, he is now acknowledged for having the spirit and zeal of a paladin.",

        "text": "My favorite character that I've played has to be a particular monk from an online Pathfinder game.  He was notable for being on a quest for non-undead immortality, while also acting in such a way that everyone else at the digital table insisted that he had no sense of self preservation.  This is one of his stories:\n\nWe were walking through a section of badlands/desert, the typical bleak and barren place you'd expect, when the terrain starts getting a bit more unpleasant than before.  A faint odor of gas (yes, I know they add the odor, don't ask me) can be detected, and we start to come across various fissures in the landscape that obviously have some sort of flammable gas spewing from them.\n\nNaturally, we get worried.  Especially so when a big lion-like creature with wings and scales is seen approaching us from a distance.  \n\nAnd then starts to inhale deeply.\n\nThinking quickly, I do a flying monk-leap at the beast, grabbing onto it in midair to try and stop it from breathing fire onto the fuel-air-mixture that surrounds us.  I only manage to drag it down with my weight, into the gas cloud, and unfortunately the creature can't stop the fire breathe once it starts.\n\n#**KA-BOOM!**\n\nReflex saves all around!  Everyone's toasty, the creature included, and the fissures of gas from before are now spouts of flame.  I'm still hanging on for dear life, but my turn's over.\n\nNot wanting to give the creature a chance to escape or breathe fire on us all again, but still wanting to kill the thing ASAP, I put trust in my monk reflexes and AC and start shouting for everyone to \"shoot it, shoot it, shoot it!\" while I ride, clutching the beast's fur/limbs on the underside in a deathgrip, through hails of arrows, lightning bolts, etc, from my teammates.\n\nFinally, once it reaches my turn again, I try another grapple check.  This time, I succeed fully, and manage to do an aerial suplex, sending the beast into the nearest gout of flame, searing its head clean off from its shoulders!  Climbing out from beneath the body, my monk dusted himself off, and we carried on our merry way.\n\nAnd that is one of the stories of my suicidally-inclined monk's quest for immortality.  Let me know if you'd like more.",

        "author": "Taggerung179",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/93co9q/dd_why_the_druid_should_be_kept_on_a_leash_part_1/",
        "text": "I originally posted this in the comments [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/93519d/healing_goes_wrong/) and then expanded. I figured it was too good not to make its own post and if you guys like this one I'll continue with more. Actually, I'll make the next part regardless.\n\nTo start things off, our party originally consisted of a Dwarven paladin and Half-elf Cleric, Rorick and Quarion, both worshipers of Pelor, a half-orc named Gaereth Whreaked (Which changed in spelling every time we wrote it in his short life), an elven ranger named Jinx, and finally me, half-elven druid, Merch Sy'n Bliadd, whose name literally translates to 'Girl who is Wolf' and my wolf companion Lleuad.\n\n\nWe each had our quirks, but seeing as I was literally raised by wolves (Although one was something of a goddess), I had *NO IDEA* how to behave in the city it became quickly apparent that I needed a full time watch to prevent me from getting into trouble.\n\nThe first of my string of shenanigans started innocently enough after we had come to the bustling city of Stormhaven for rest after scouring the ruins of an abandoned asylum looking for clues about some evil prophesy.\n\nI had a keen sense of smell and was separated from the party, allured towards the market district where the party quickly found me by a sweet roll stall. Drooling, I took one and was apprehended by the stall merchant, unhappy that I did not pay. I understood the concept of doing good, but had no grasp of money as both the merchant and party tried to explain that I needed to pay for the food. Finally understanding what they meant, I dug around for one of the 'shiny pebbles' I carried. I rolled to see what type of coin I brought out and was pleased when I placed down one glittering gold piece, asking how much this would buy.\n\nThe sweet rolls were 1 copper each.\n\nDM does some rolling to see how many sweet rolls the merchant had and I walked away with 87 freshly baked confectioneries.\n\nWell, I could only carry so much. But lucky for me Lleuad had some [saddle bags he carried](https://imgur.com/a/JGB9TO7) and was able to carry what I could not eat nor carry.\n\nStill, I quickly realized I had *way* too many rolls for one per- er- two wolves, so I gave a few away.\n\nTired from both travel and the brief bit of trouble I caused the party quickly decided to find an inn to stay at and Rorick complained that he needed a drink.\n\nI had heard about the mythical liquid 'alcohol' from my mother, and was eager to try some myself. Rorick seeing my excitement, laughed and promised to buy me a drink or two, confident that some strong drink combined with lack of experience would humble me some. That was his second mistake.\n\nThe place was called the Ill Moon Inn, and the barteneder, Bart, was a large muscular fellow. Poor sod greeted us when we came in, took our coin and gave us our drinks. DM wanted me to make fortitude saves for every drink after the first. \n\nNatural 20 on the first. 17 on the second.\n\nBy the time I downed my 8 mug of ale every dwarf in the tavern stopped to stare at this skinny little half-elven girl who couldn't be older that 17 drink the Rorick the dwarf under the table. \n\nBart starts giving me some worried glances ready to cut me off, and then it happened.\n\nNatural 1. Palor Bless.\n\nBefore the the DM can say anything I a slip him a note. He nods in approval.\n\nI roll a D100 to determine the power of spell from my arsenal. \n\n97- Look at my most powerful spells I have at the moment. 3rd level Plant Growth.\n\nThe all wood inn then starts to sprout, vines growing everywhere, panic immediately ensues. One minute later the inn is smack dab in the middle of a tree, most of the exits obscured or blocked off. \n\nBart looks like he's about the have a heart attack. I pass out, finally succumbing to drink.\n\nI wake up the next morning, in a cell with a massive hangover. Next to Garith Rekt. And the rest of the party glowering. Turns out after the guards came, I was identified as the culprit of the 'wild' magic and was brought to jail. Gareth Wrekked, who was unfortunately already asleep when the incident occurred, tried to mount a rescue once he found out what happened to me, storming the city barracks to rescue me. The party tried to stop him and many failed diplomacy rolls later everyone in my party shared the cell until things got sorted out.\n\nThe only one missing was Lleuad with 50+ sweet rolls.\n\nI did not know what jail was and I asked the irritated guard what the 3 stone walls were for, ignoring the fact that we were separated by thick iron bars. \n\nHe said 'Its to keep troublemakers like you in here.'\n\nI gave him a sort of puzzled and confused look. 'But I can walk through stone easy. Here look.' and proceeded to cast Meld into Stone and simply walked right out, to the bewilderment of the guard, and worse the party, who went into so much effort to rescue me. \n\nOf course the guards were all in a panic, but not because of me- *well not directly*. Outside I was greeted by Lleuad and every stray animal in Stormhaven. Turns out he was really worried about me and had a saddlebag full of sweet rolls. He bribed every stray cat, dog and horse to to come to the barracks and make a distraction.\n\nPleased by my companion's concern for me and with the realization I had done something wrong I returned to the Ill Moon Inn and attempted to fix my mistake. Poor Bart nearly had a stroke when he saw me and immediately threw me out.\n\nOk. Stealth mode activated. As I could not yet turn into something as small as a cat, I cast camouflage and snuck past a openly weeping Bart. (You know you dun fucked up when you make a grown man cry) and stuck upstairs. Whipping out my druid magic, I start fixing things and shaping wood. I size out the rooms, open up windows that had been blocked off. I even added flowering vines the the ceiling and once done with the upper floor, I risked working on the ground floor. Bart, in his grief, did not notice me until my work was done and I dropped my camouflage. Before he could kick me out I told him to look around. The tangled mess of vines and shrubbery had been cleared away, the tables now look like they had been grown from the floor and the vines on the ceiling were covered with various grafted fruits and flowers.\n\nI had apologized and asked for Bart's forgiveness. I left with free lodgings for life, provided I limit myself to only 2 drinks per night.\n\nSoon the Ill Moon Inn was lovingly referred to as 'The Drunken Druid'\n\nShame we had to blow it up along with the entire city a week later.",

        "text": "*This is a story from a one shot game with a couple of friends. It's set in present day in our local city (Salisbury), and is written from the perspective of my character after the events have been concluded. Safe to say, this was not how we planned events to go.  Enjoy!*\n\nSo you’ve probably heard a lot about me. Me and a few others have been in the papers for quite a while now- I’m labelled often as an insane mass murdering serial killer, and I’m currently facing charges on the single biggest and most baffling act of domestic terrorism seem in the United Kingdom since Guy Fawkes.\n\nMost of these accusations are pretty accurate. Here I shall attempt to explain why I did these things. What follows is the truth, as far as I am aware- Believe what you will.\n\nThere are two people you’ll want to know about before I properly begin- Myself, and my recent friend John Leadbeater. I am a recently returned Iraq war veteran- I’ve always been something of a survivalist and a conspiracy nut, and I managed to drive away what little friends and family I had through these passions. This coupled with poor financial planning lead me to be living in a shed in a field near Salisbury. This shed contained a very large assortment of weapons- Several shotguns, a rifle, basic body armour as well as a pair of service pistols.   \n John in contrast was a 70-year-old Vietnam veteran, who’d migrated to England with his Grandson Craig for a variety of mysterious and confusing reasons. He was still somewhat poorly adjusted to normal society, and was also one of the strongest men I have ever met. He lived in the red lobster pub and could set fire to things with his hands.\n\nIt was in this pub that I first met him. After a few drinks, we left to go wonder the streets in a drunken haze. It was here we actually did some good- We saved a young vet from a brutal murder by the single most inhuman creature I have ever seen. It fled as we ran over, drawing attention with our drunken cries. I tried to perform basic medical aid on the vet, failed and then called an ambulance.  \n John however, enraged that anyone would attack someone so brazenly on the street, charged after the attacker. He insulted him quite impressively, but somewhat fortunately for John, the creature merely seemed confused and left him alone\n\nFrom that moment on we dedicated our entire lives to hunting this horrific beast. It would probably have been better if we had just not.\n\nThe next day we began to research this beasty. We found a few references to it in conjunction with a journalist in the Salisbury journal (A Miss Miriam Coldwater). John contacted a friend of his to learn the address of this journalist. His baffled and worried friend refused to give up the address but did pass on the mobile phone number. John attempted to contact her, only to be stonewalled by the even more confused journalist\n\nWith our leads yielding nothing, we decided our best course would be to roam the streets in search of the vampire. Somehow, this actually worked- We encountered a servant of the creature in the suburbs of Salisbury, who ambushed John as I investigated a mysterious patch of blood. John used his flaming hands to set it alight, while I quickly arrived with my axe and set about it. We managed to subdue it after a fairly short fight, and then john immediately dealt with the unconscious and aflame vampiric servant by crushing its head in with a single mighty blow with his walking stick. I’m still not entirely sure why he needed a cane, but we quickly looted the body of the thing and found £40 in cash, a wallet containing a drivers licence for a one “Lo-kag Burrows”, and a police file with our names and pictures with instructions to deal with us quickly before we end up doing something stupid. This turned out to be a somewhat self-fulfilling prophecy, and we left the body by the side of the road. We also realised that this meant that someone high up in the police must be working with the vampire and was trying to kill us.\n\nThe address listed on the licence was one for a house in the same area that we found the vampire, so the next day we went to and found his grandmother still living there. John immediately kicked down the door with the force of 5 spartan warriors and scared the grandmother so much that she immediately phoned the police. We quickly fled the scene, running down the lane and vaulting over the wall into a nearby dilapidated school, where we went to the top of the closest building and hid in the attic, where the policemen and police dogs failed to notice us. As soon as the scene was relatively clear, we fled down the one-way  system, so as to avoid meeting any policemen coming up the stairs, and out into Exceter street where we made our way through the police cordon and to Johns grandsons flat. His grandson (Craig) was then enlisted to drive us around, what with neither of us being able to drive. The police were now searching for us in earnest, for the crimes of being vampire hunters, murders, and granny assaulters.\n\nWe realised quickly that we’d forgotten to get any kind of lead from the grandmother’s house, and that our only options were to arrange a meeting with Miriam Coldwater and attempt to force information from her and thus clear our names from any kind of wrong-doing. This meeting was arranged for 10 o’clock the next day (Sunday) in the Salisbury cathedral. I picked this because \n\nOn that fateful Sunday, we arrived at the cathedral an hour early and attempted to blend in with the crowd. This failed impressively, and when we started hearing police sirens we quickly hid on the second floor of the cathedral, overlooking the main floor. While were unable to spot Miriam in the crowd of Sunday worshippers, we were able to spot armed police closing in on the location. I continued to hide and watch out in case our one lead turned up, while John fled up the cathedral, heading up to the spire as far as he could go. John quickly realised that we needed a distraction to allow us to escape from the cathedral, and also noticed the many wooden supports holding up the spire. His hands alight, he did what came most naturally to him and created one of the most unnecessarily large distractions in the history of police evasion.  \n We joined with the crowd fleeing the burning house of God, and almost made it out of the close when we were spotted and pointed out to the large numbers of police, all who had gained our descriptions from the grandmother and from the police\n\nAs the heavily armed police forces closed on our position, I attempted to knock John unconscious in an attempt to cut and run. This failed, so I then attempted to swing randomly at people in the crowd, so as to allow John to cut and run. This too failed. The firemen were quickly summoned to try and save England’s tallest cathedral and the magna carta. They too failed, and we were carted off by the police as Salisbury Cathedral’s spire came crashing down behind us \n\nThe events leading to my release from prison and John’s escape are too convoluted and strange to properly convey. Suffice to say, we both separately discovered the location of the vampire- Me from an unrelated vampire lawyer, and him from a heavily beaten police chief. We were reunited on Wednesday morning on a farm on the outskirts of Salisbury, where we had been informed the vampire was staying. Having learned very little, we kicked down the door and John was immediately shot in the chest with a shotgun. This shotgun was being held by the farmer/scientist who owned the place, who was immediately tackled and disarmed by 100 pounds of senior citizen muscle. The mans cries wakened the vampire, who had been sleeping in the basement. The vampire charged upstairs and set about us with a longsword, brutally decapitating the poor John in a single swing before falling asleep bc he was a very tired vampire. I attempted to drag the vampire out into the sun, only to be prevented by the farmer who somehow managed to dodge two shotgun blasts and a fireaxe. The farmed refused to give up, so I stabbed him repeatedly, and then dragged the vampire out into the sunlight before it managed to wake up where it burnt to a crisp, unable to prevent this due to being unconscious and asleep and also on fire from johns flaming hands. With the beast dead, and the police arriving on the scene, I handed myself in and resigned myself to whatever fate may come my way.",

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nFellow VtM (tabletop) player here, we started to play a couple of months ago on a combat-oriented chronicle, but with a good mix of politics and investigations because our ST likes those.\n\nOur group is composed by: a ex-con Gangrel (me), a sort-of Brujah investigator without Potence but Obfuscate, a pure Brujah \"cop\", an Assamite(!), a Tremere(!!) and a Toreador musician-gunslinger.\n\nWe had our deal of troubles and mess with our first mission in Vienna, personal plots and schemes, crimes against the Masquerade, Villains.. our characters ended up scarred from that mission.Once back they welcomed as heroes of Vienna, those who liberated Bratislava from the Sabbath, and our superiors praised us. We started our second mission with a premise: let's play smart, let's use our head first then our disciplines.\n\nMission: go to Stockholm, find one of our PC's mentor and help him deal with the barony there, **if** needed. First day we arrived at the hotel, the Mentor found us and told us we were undercover, he would give us more informations the next night.  \nSecond day, we were at the hall and suddenly the ST decided it was time to test us: roll on Willpower for our Toreador, failed.  \n\"You hear a music coming from the main hall of the hotel, a band is playing a song and you feel the urge to go play your violin with them, you are in a frenzy-like status\" ST  \nAnd here we go, she went there and started to play the damn violin with this band.  \nNot a big deal, until our Brujah Cop decided it was time to show off, in front of everyone, how he spent the xp he gained.  \n\"I got it guys, I'm going to take her\" Brujah Cop  \n\"There are a lot of people, Brujah Cop, what do you do?\" ST  \n\"I just move the people by force until I'm in front of her\" Brujah Cop  \n\"People are starting to get nervous, but the music is so good they don't mind you. Ok you're in front of her. Now what?\"  \n\"I stare at her and use my new Discipline: Presence. I want to intimidate her to stop her and follow me\"  \nRoll: 4 successes.   \nAll the people there felt the effects of his intimidation.  \n\"You did a good job, but she's in a frenzy-like status so she cannot hear you until she stops. But all the spectators are afraid of you. Ok guys, what do you do in the meanti...\" ST   \n\"Ok, then I pick her up by force.\" Brujah Cop   \n\"In front of everyone?\" ST   \n\"Yes, let me roll for a grapple\" Brujah Cop   \nRoll vs Roll: Brujah Cop obviously overpowered the Toreador Musician   \n\"You've picked her up, but now the people are starting to panic, some of them are attacking you while others are calling the police.\" ST   \nThis started a big fight between Brujah Cop and everyone at the hotel, he overpowered everyone who attacked him, cops called for reinforcements and a SWAT team arrived, he surrendered and he was taken to the local police department. Toreador Musician was taken to a hospital, the others didn't get involve but the undercover mission started to crack.\n\nMe and Tremere decided to go to the police department to get Brujah Cop out, while the others tried to find Toreador Musician.  \nWe were sure this would go easy, but Brujah Cop wasn't on the same page.  \n\"I use Potence to break the lock\" Brujah Cop  \n\"Do you really want to use Potence?\" ST  \n\"Yes I do, then with Celerity I will repair it with my Mechanical Repair skill\" Brujah Cop  \nHe rolled, success on breaking the door.  \n\"You make a lot of noise and, since you do not have any tools, you cannot repair the door. What now?\" ST    \n\"I take a look outside the cell.\" Brujah Cop   \n\"Cops are coming towards you and they are armed\" ST   \n\"Ok I use my Celerity to go back to the cell\" Brujah Cop   \nThe cops, after what he did, started to panic and pointed guns at him, telling him Swedish gibberish he cannot understand, so Brujah Cop decided it was time to use Celerity to disarm them.   \n\"They are calling reinforcements, around 7-8 people, armed with shotguns. They are all freaking out and there is a huge commotion about a &lt;blur moving inside a cell&gt; and other inexplicable things going on. They are on you, what do you do now?\"   \n\"I'll sit on the floor in a meditating pose, I do not want them to think I'm a threat\" Brujah Cop   \nThe policemen started to shout things in Swedish, but since he didn't speak Swedish or English he did not understand and stayed in a weird meditating pose, so a cop freaked out and shot by mistake (failed roll of the ST).   \n\"I use my celerity to dodge\" Brujah Cop   \n\"Ok, the policemen see you move at that speed and start to panic, all of them start to shoot at you because they are scared to death, you have to dodge\" ST\n\nFinally, me and Tremere arrived at the Police Department: what we found was a warzone.\nAt some point we saw a mangled corpse taken away by the ambulance, we tried to enter the police station but we got blocked by a English-speaking cop who asked us \"what do you need? We're in a emergency, we had a case of a sort of supernatural event, you cannot pass.\" So I said \"we're here because one of our comrades got arrested by mistake, someone thought he attacked someone, but actually he didn't\", he then replied \"Oh THAT GUY! He was taken away by the paramedics, his situation his so critical he may be dead, come with me, you're under arrest.\"\n\nOur cover was blown, the Mentor decided to leave us to deal with all the shit, Toreador got me out thanks to her persuasion abilities, but in order to save Brujah Cop we had to mask all of us as a wealthy arab guy with 5 wives, take Brujah Cop body and replace it with another disfigured corpse, our Toreador just \"awe-ed\" the way out for us, but the Prince got pissed off at us for doing so many stupid things at once and punished Brujah Cop with a \"mind bomb\" of mental disciplines. Did this situation teach us something? Yes, but not to Brujah Cop, who decided to investigate a night-club by starting a fight with the bouncers......\n\nSorry for the bad English, not my native language, but I hope the story is understandable and made you at least smile at the WTF moments.",

        "text": "Originally posted with [**an accompanying comic**](http://www.handbookofheroes.com/archives/comic/credulousness). Here by my tale. Ahem:\n\nSo there we were, hot on the trail of a chaos cult. It was a vaguely 40K themed Pathfinder game, so there were certain unsavory elements at play. Suffice it to say that the cult's front was a house of pleasure. After our valiant heroes resisted the advances of the bordello's chaos-tainted tarts, we decided to head into the seedy establishment's sub-basement in search of its rumored demonic mastermind.\n\nWe ended the session there. Our GM's parents were coming to visit, so we assumed that the game was off for a week.\n\n\"Nope,\" said he. \"Game on! Also, my dad is going to be a guest player.\"\n\nI'm not sure I'd want my parental unit to guest star in a Slaanesh-fueled romp through a house of ill repute, but that wasn't my call to make. We met daddy dearest's kobold rogue the next week. She was loitering in the whore house kitchens, and sort of glommed onto the party in the way that drug-addled kobold rogues will do. Being a long-time player, Dad-kobold (we'll call her Dadold) took up her natural place at the front of the party. Of course she found the trap. Of course she failed her save. And of course it was a *waves of ecstasy* spell.\n\n\"You're basically in a state of constant orgasm for the next 10 rounds,\" says the GM to his own father. Imagine the coo of a pigeon, but higher-pitched and more sensual. This is the sound we were treated to for the next 60 seconds. I had no idea female kobolds were capable of such utterances. The memory will haunt me to my grave.\n\nAll of the above was just the first room. As we grew to know Dadold, we learned that she was a strangely literal creature.\n\n\"Better luck on the next trap,\" we said. \"Just keep checking for 'em.\"\n\n\"OK,\" she said.\n\nMy dude noticed her jump over a step and keep walking. Happily, I succeeded at my Sense Motive check.\n\n\"Dadold? Was that step trapped?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"It was *very* trapped.\"\n\n\"Were you going to tell us?\"\n\n\"You told me to check for traps. Not to tell you about them.\"\n\nWe enjoyed several other interactions of this kind in the next several chambers. The door was not locked. Dadold picked it anyway because we'd told her to open all locks. There were monsters moving about beyond. How was Dadold to know that she was supposed to warn us about them?\n\n\"Look,\" I said. \"If we want to get out of this alive, we all need to work together. Just make sure and tell us if you spot any danger.\"\n\nWe arrived at the boss chamber. It was a horrible tentacle monster, because of course it was. Dadold rolls high on her initiative.\n\n\"Look!\" she cried. \"A dangerous monster demon thing! Pass turn.\"\n\nMy blood pressure managed to survive the evening, and Dadold retired from the campaign and flew back across the country. There were many lessons to be learned from that night around the gaming table, but I think the most important was this: If you're obliged to deal with a literal sort of PC, make sure that you phrase instructions clearly. Sarcasm is lost on certain creatures, most especially trolls.",

        "text": "Hello Folks,\n\nOne of the goals of our group in 2018 was to go back and re-edit our older podcasts, and the final story arc in that project was our Vampire: the Masquerade story “Juarez on Fire”.\n\nThis is a Vampire: The Masquerade game set in 1942 that tells the story of the Sabbat pack \"The Pale Riders\". To be honest, when we originally started this game we meant for it to be a break from our regular game and for it to be more of a hack and slash raise hell Sabbat quick story. It ended up being so much more than that, and I even kind of knew that during the character creation session when the players told me their concepts.\n\nThis story ended up being a major turning point for our group. This is the story where we realized we knew each other’s playing style, and were comfortable with exploring many themes. Juarez on Fire is so much more than a story about Sabbat vampires. It’s about family, bonds, self-discovery, re-inventing yourself, seeing those you love in pain, and evolving into something other than human…something that is a monster.\n\nWhat was meant to be a quick side game ended up being our longest running story-arc, and one where I learned many lessons as a Story Teller.\n\nWe hope you enjoy this as much as we enjoyed making it.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/twin-cities-by-night/sets/vampire-the-masquerade-juarez\n\nThis is a Vampire: the Masquerade Revised Edition game.

        "text": "It's almost a rite of passage and a tradition with every group I run that we attempt a 'escort the one ring' quest in middle earth. I can't really remember how many times I've done it, but the end result is always great. This is the story of the second time I put a group through it.\n\nIt began after the secret council in rivendell, with the PC's being among those attending. The fellowship consisted of radagast the brown, two dwarven brothers from the lonely mountain, a human Ranger with the ranger class, and the sons of Elrond. As with every One Ring campaign I run, I showed them a map of the previous adventure, which also had the original rout from the books on it. They looked it over before looking to each other, all of them coming to a single agreement, that if they were to get the one ring to mount doom, they'd need to trick sauron as much as make as much haste as possible.\n\nThey planned two routs, one following the edge of the mountains to pass through isengard, the other would cross them at the point of Rivendell and approach Mordor from the north. They did this...because they wanted to split the party. On top of that, they wanted Elrond to take the ring and create a copy, one with no power but had a similar presence to it, then give one copy of the ring to one group, and the real one to the other, but not tell either group who had what. For all intensive purposes, they simultaneously did, and did not have the ring of power.\n\nI made it very clear that this would take a while to do, and that there would be consequences for such a delay, but they accepted this and waited the month required for a fake ring to be forged. They were warned that if a ringwrath touched it, it would instantly know it was a fake and they'd be screwed. Again, they took it on the chin and waited for the appointed day. Both parties took their rings and set off in opposite directions. One contained radagast, one dwarf and one elf. the other had the ranger, the other dwarf, and the other elf. Brothers were separated and trusting their sibling to fend for themselves. \n\nThe details of the inital sessions are unimportant, but each party had their fair share of mayhem and combat. One group dealing with the spiders of mirkwood, as well as undead, while the others had to contend with trolls and other such hulking mountain beasts. It wasn't until the Radagast group made it to the other side of mirkwood that they got their first taste of the ringwraths. Keep in mind this was the group that had gone away from Mordor instead of closer to it, yet at night on the edge of mirkwood. Guarded by a small squad of elven rangers, there they saw the leathery, hulking fellbeasts flapping in the sky, screeching into the night as they scanned the plains below, all while they huddled up on the edge of the tree line. With some careful planning and crafty use of spells they were able to plot a course through thick foliage and modify their magic cloaks to make them all look like bushes, after this they went to bed. The next morning, all the elves were gone save for Elladan (Elronds son), an ill omen, but they pushed on regardless, their plan working wonderfully, getting them far enough away from the ringwraith searching area to continue at a marching pace. From there they got to the Celduin river, made some boats using magic, and set sail.\n\nMeanwhile, the other group made it far south, sticking within the shadows of the mountains always, but never getting so close as to be buffeted by the cold winds, or too far away to feel the sun on their face for more than half the day. Progress was fast, especially after they had managed to obtain some wargs off an orc raiding party and successfully tame them. They only used the beasts for two days though, killing them after that for food and because they didn't need the extra attention. They were squarely in Dunland, putting them at odds with savage humans, little more than tribal clans. While they faced little issue in the way of being found by their own tracks, they had to move at a crawl for the rest of the way towards isengard where Saruman awaited their arrival. Yet, their biggest threat was by far the ringwraiths, now circling over the lands, scouring them for the one ring their master seemed to desire so very much. Like the first group, similar tactics were applied in the form of stealth, although they took to killing several local Dunlanders, stripping them, and donning their attire in order to pass through the country with greater ease, with the dwarf having to suffer a growth spell every now and then to make him human sized.\n\nWhen they got to Isengard, it was...leveled, totally destroyed save for the tower. The Ents had been and gone, leveling the place and reducing it to so much ash and cinders. There was something off about the Ents though, all of the ones the group could see were missing their leaves despite it being summer time, their bark black and gnarled, their eyes burning red. Instead of approaching one, they used the large caverns pocking the landscape, now filled with water, to swim to the tower and get inside. They wanted to ransack it for magic items and other supplies before pushing on towards the lands of the horse people. They found all they wanted, and Saruman. Instead of an epic boss battle against the mighty mage, they found him grumpy and scowling in his office, looking towards Mordor with the scrying orb on his desk. He turned to greet them, and offered them all a seat while he unraveled the tale of how this world had a new dark lord.\n\nJumping over to the other group. They sailed down the Celduin River for about three days, after which they were forced to abandon the original plan. RingWaiths were flying along the length of the river now, day and night, tracing it for any signs of sailors or otherwise. The group even witnessing an attack on one such vessel. The fellbeast would smash into it in a dive, knocking it to the bank of the river while the wraith leaped out, killing everyone aboard as it searched, only ever pausing if it saw an elf, but kept on slaughtering until no one was left alive. Their goal was to hit up the Sea of Rhun, more specifically, part of a nation that had yet to defect to Saurons side, who would aid them in their final step of the journey. They made it far, sometimes relying on Radagasts spells to swim underneath the Celduins surface to cover great stretches of land when there were no trees, others they simply waited until dark and relied upon Elladans elven eyes to lead the way. It all proved for naught though, as they only managed to make it to the fork between the Celduin and the Carnen before they were spotted. Not by the Ringwraiths, but elves. The party greeted them warmly as they approached, meeting them under the cover of some thick trees, but as they drew closer, something was definitely off about their appearence. Their skin was far more pale, their eyes all a ghostly blue, their ears elongated more than normal. They calmly asked for Elladan to return home to Rivendell with them, as well as radagast if he felt so inclined. Of course the party rejected, at which point they found themselves facing off against the squad, which they cut down to the last man. With bodies burned and their backpacks filled with additional gear, they carried on...Until the ringwraiths finally found them, all because they had decided to burn the bodies, leaving a nice smoking becon for the wraiths to work off of as a reference point. Four wraiths circled them, and they had one goal...Elladan. Whom they scooped off the ground and flew off with, leaving the other two flabbergasted, especially considering the Dwarf was the one with the ring.\n\nSaruman grumpily poured the second group some wine and made a little food while they gave him a hand here and there. After they got a fire started, they ate as he unraveled a depressing tale. As in the books and movies, Saruman had betrayed everyone and sided with Sauron, his isengard tower converted into a monolith of dark magic and a breeding pit for his new species of orc, all in preparation for an attack on Rohan and eventually minas tirith, all in service of letting Sauron out of Mordor and aiding in his conquest. But, something unexpected happened, the Ents came in and destroyed everything...Alongside an elven envoy. This elf offered Saruman freedom if he submitted himself to the new pale lord, and ensured that if he allowed himself to be marked, he would have a place in the new world. Saruman said he'd think on the offer and remain in his tower for the time being, though he asked for the name of his potential new master, to which the elf responded, Elrond.  \n\n\nAfter some questioning, discussion and such, the second group eventually realized what had happened, Elrond had taken control of the One Ring. The rings both groups had been given were perfect fakes. After some talking, they agreed to go back to rivendell and put a stop to this before anything got any worse, at which point Saruman said he'd join them. Which is when I introduced a friend of mine to the game who had been dying to play D&amp;D again. With this allowed, the four of them used a teleport spell to head to Rivandell.\n\nMeanwhile, with Radagast and the dwarf brother, their arrival to Rivandell was, admittedly, more me bending things a bit to get everyone together, but they all agreed this was for the best. Basically, Radagast was able to contact the eagles and hitch a ride. Which should have taken a while to do, but things were fudged so they'd get a set of wings within a few hours.  \n\n\nElladan was carried back home, finding the valley he had grown up in and loved so dearly had been twisted into an eerie, haunting, beautiful but alien place. Stark whites and pitch blacks dominated everything, the trees were like masses of bone smoothed out into sculptures of wood, all the stone was obsidian, the mighty river black as midnight. The ringwraith dropped him off in the main courtyard, where he was met by his father and some of the other elven rulers, Galadriel noticeably absent. Elrond was the only thing of colour in this monochrome world, sporting a long, flowing purple robe with impossibly delicate silver leaf patterns across its hem, the collar made of fuchsia feathers that ploomed up around his neck. But his face? It was still the face of his father.\n\nThe two of them stood there and looked over the transformed valley, talking calmly about what would happen now. Elladan had figured out what HAD happened already, he just needed to know what his father intended to do with this power. In short, save the elven race, bring it back to its former glory by using the one ring to empower them all. He possessed the rings of the other elven rulers, including Gandalfs personal ring, he also possessed Galadriels power after she disagreed with him. All he had to do now was wait until Sauron smashed his forces against those of Minas Tirith and Rohan before surging in with his own. Killing Sauron at the expense of the already declining mortal kingdoms that were destined to die sooner rather than later. His logic was cold and brutal, but it did make sense.  \n\n\nMost of all though, he wanted Elladan to join him, as father and son they could rule middle earth. All he needed now was his younger son and they could join together and claim their birthright. Just then, pretty much everyone else showed up on time. Saruman teleported the second group in, and radagast with his dwarven friend plopped down on the ground from the eagles talons. Naturally, everyone disagreed with Elrond...Except Elladan. The two of them stood side by side as father and son, ready to face the rest of them.\n\nElladan brought in some of the other elven rulers to make the numbers even before they all charged. The dwarves fighting together as they killed Thranduil by smashing his balls in with their hammers, Radagast unleashing rot spells on an assassin elf who worked under Elrond, turning her into mulch. The Elladan and Elrohir (the elf brothers) clashed blades, evenly matched with little leeway given, but in the end, Elrohir was the one to pinch magic items from Saruman, not Elladan. Never underestimate the power of a portable hole. Elladan found his foot went right through it, putting him completely off balance and vulnerable, it only took a single well placed strike to decapitate him after that.\n\nMeanwhile Saruman and Elrond were engaged in a battle of spells, each one, rather unspectacular, counterspelling the other, leaving no room for any major pyrotechnics of any kind. It got so bad that by the time the others had finished killing their opponents, only Elrond was left. In a last ditch effort, Elrond called upon the power of the one ring and was fully consumed by it, becoming Sauron in body. With a combined effort, they still managed to bring him down, with Elrothir dashing into a shrine to pick up the shattered remains of a powerful sword to cut off Sauron/Elronds fingers, returning him to his normal form before they executed him on the spot.\n\nThat is where we ended the game. Without the elves being organized, and with all that time wasted, Sauron was able to march his forces into middle earth and sweep away any who opposed him, the only thing the party was really able to do in the end, was take the ring with them as they crossed the seas, abandoning the world they had once known for the gray havens.\n\nSide note. This was an absolute bitch of a campaign to run.",

        "text": "We were balls deep in a political campaign, with the party having sided with the revolution as they were readying up to overthrow the current government. Among the usual things revolutionaries tend to do before civil war, the party had been tasked to kidnap if possible, a nobleman, a high member of the minds eye library. As all noblemen do, they just happened to be throwing a party, the perfect opportunity to sneak in and catch him unawares.\n\nSo the rogue, the paladin, the bard and the sourcerer all went to the event, leaving the rest of the group behind. IC reasons was because the others weren't exactly stealthy, OOC reason being one of them had to attend a funeral, and the other a birthday. The party was briefed on the event as well as the layout of the location before being given outfits to pretty themselves up, though the rogue, who had taken levels in spymaster, took a small case with two extra bits of attire just to be safe.\n\nThe whole event was taking place in the royal gardens, putting them elbow to elbow with a whole slew of nobility and the closest they ever got to the ruling prince and vizier. However, they had their orders, they could kill as many as possible, most likely causing a large amount of damage to the upper crust, but they desperately needed  the noblemens mental records. The dress code was masquerade, so everyone was decked out in extremely fancy robes of all sorts, many of them would take ages to get in or out of, and they all made it nearly impossible to tell who was who. \n\nEveryone had been provided with a basic description of what their nobleman would be wearing, with the main snag being that he was there with a number of his associates. The majority of the session was spent tracking him down, stealing from the nobility while they were there, engaging in gossip, spreading bad rumours, mainly roleplay, no combat. The paladin spent her time talking shit about her own god to get in the good books of the priest she met there, learning about some unsavory rituals that were being performed, as well as discovering the source of power for the zealous, rather inhuman royal guard. The Sourcerer managed to upstage one of the many entertainers there and wowed the crowd with his ability to create fireworks in the form of a modified fireball, later on he'd also steal a LOT of money from the nobles, which included masks, coin purses, jewelry, fine wines, drugs and even some magic items. The bard spent his time bouncing between fucking every noblemans wife, and learning a lot about the inner circle of the city, with information that would really help later in the campaign.  \n\n\nThen we get to the rogue. He had been using a combination of things to kill random noblemen and women for the fun of it. First he'd use slight of hand to give them some wisdom damaging poison in their food or drink (his slight of hand was so high it was downright unfair to the NPCs.), then he'd lure them into a quiet spot before using his most prized possession on them, a knife of disintegration. It had a few effects, but the main one was that it destroyed the body of a person and left nothing behind after they died save for their clothes. So the rogue, by the time he had found their target, was lugging around a suitcase of twenty peoples clothes and personal belongings, it wasn't even a bad of holding.\n\nWhile he was working on number 21, he was spotted in the bright flashing light of a firework, or rather, a fireball shot into the air, and the guards went over to investigate. His first response was \"I jump into the bushes and change my clothes.\" Being a spy master, he could change his disguise within 2d4 rounds. So the slender man in a crows mask became a fat women with a pig mask and a pink dress, the guards waved 'her' on as they went back to hunting. He then made another roll to change clothes into a third disguise, becoming a lanky man with a poodle mask. One round more and he would have been spotted by the patrolling guards as he tried to shift attires. He left the secluded area post haste before someone noticed his disguise. One knife and a very loud scream later, he let some people see him running away from the crime scene before demanding to be allowed to change into the swan costume, it took 2 rounds for him to strip naked and don the most elaborate costume he had stolen.\n\nThe guards turned the corner to find him, get honked at, and then watch him waddle away in total and utter bamboozlement. With that done he shimmied over to the target and tried to give him some poison to knock him out, fumbled the check on a nat one, and had to run away in the swan costume while the guards rushed after him. \"I start changing the moment i get around a corner!\" He wanted to don an equally elaborate bull costume.   Fucking crit rolled and did it in three rounds. The guards came around the corner, found him...And proceeded to attack.  \n\n\nThere had been reports of people going missing with someone always near the crime scene, disappearing each time. After this had happened 6 times (the number of times he had been spotted killing someone), they had caught on. The player bitched, but couldn't argue with that logic. A giant swan isn't just replaced by a giant bull, with no one thinking twice about it. The rest of the party took a long look at their friend...and didn't go to his aid. They left with the other guests, heading to the castle where it was safe...while knocking out the target and shoving him into the bad of holding, keeping his head out of it, but covered by a black cowl so as not to draw attention.  \n\n\nThe rogue tried to run and pull the same trick after jumping down a well, but with the guard surrounding the garden he had ran into, with the party dispersing, he had little chance of escaping even with his new sequined ball gown and fake F size knockers. He made a final stand that night, throwing himself past the guards to kill as many noblemen as he possibly could, using those fake tits from his disguise kit for their secondary and much more lethal purpose, explosives.\n\nHe really did go out with a bang.",

        "text": "It was during the yearly war of the hardbread buttering, in fair Nordmark, shire of Attemark, the sun washed over the world in quiet awe and the soft green grass of the battlefield was warm to the touch as distant crashes and shouts of war were heard from the nearby forest.\n\nTwo men were sitting down, talking about life, fighting and their long journey there, for they both were guests from lands across the sea, two knights, one originally a squire to the other.\n\nA third man approaches, dragging shield and sword in one hand and unbuckling his helmet with the other, there is a muffled thud as the heavy steel cage hits the ground and he sits down next to his brother knights, him too a squire of the oldest.\n\n\"How was the fighting?\"\n\n\"Oh, it was great, but also fucking annoying! They can't charge! The Swedes don't know how to charge a spear wall, it's just... spears every where and you can't do anything, they start and then they just... back off! It's fucking annoying! I tried, I really tried, they just don't know how to charge.\"\n\n\"Come now, it can't be that bad, at least you had fun?\"\n\n\"Oh it was fun, but it's fucking annoying, It's just so boring and static, I should have brought my own spear.\"\n\nI took note of the man's coat of arms, of his red and teal tunic, of the shape of his helm and tone of his voice. I promised myself to remember his words and try my damndest to give him the fight he wanted.\n\nThe next day, the list field on the grassy plain had been plucked apart, the long boards of the fence were placed on the ground, forming an imaginary tower, broad enough for three or four men standing shoulder to shoulder. If you stepped outside, you fell to your imagined death.\n\nAs the teams were arranged, and the generals started talking tactics, I found the knight from yesterday, his bright voice still sung with energy and joy, he was having fun before everything had started, there would be no spears inside of the narrow castle.\n\nHe was on my team.\n\n\"My good sir!\" I extolled.\n\n\"Oh hello! Hi! You're the guy with the chair we looked at.\"\n\n\"Hah, yeah! But I'm not here about that. See, I overheard what you said yesterday.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"About how us Swedes cannot charge.\"\n\n\"Oh, hah, yeah sorry, it was just so frustrating, I did not mean to cause offense.\"\n\n\"I'm not here to take offense, I'm here to say that I'll be your shield for every round, just tell me when and I'll go, we'll charge them together.\"\n\n\"Oh, brilliant, that's, that's fantastic!\"\n\nThe best way I can describe his eyes would be gleeful.\n\nThe two armies were then split in two again, and placed in diagonally opposite corners of the allied force, causing them to surround and be surrounded by the enemy team in the corners immediately next to them.\n\n\"FIGHTER'S READY!?\" shields were bashed and grunts extolled.\n\nThe knight put the hilt of his sword on my shoulder.\n\n\"I'll say go.\"\n\n\"Got you.\"\n\nI balled up a bit, bent my knees, tensed my shield arm. The air coming through the breaths of my helmet was warm, my breastplate locked firm around my chest.\n\n\"LAY ON!\"\n\nAnd we took two large steps toward the other side.\n\n\"Go.\"\n\nWhen water breaks through a dam, it does not overflow at once, one point starts out ahead, turning in to a lone trickle, but as the water breaks, the trickle becomes a swelling rush of water.\n\nI rushed forwards, taking long and heavy steps, the shield wall to my left followed, one by one. The Finnish giant on the other side crouched down, but I was closer to the ground. We locked shields and I pushed upward with everything I could, and even if I could not see it, I felt him upend. I sensed and heard the sword of the knight fly over me, over and over again, batting away greatweapons and striking helmets as I hauled a man twice my size through the enemy line, pushing people off of the tower, breaking their formation.\n\nAfter a few more seconds, he too fell, if he was slain or if he got tipped to the side, I'll never know, but we still stood, a handful of us, having taken the corner from the enemy force and now needing to fall on the enemies fighting our friends.\n\nI fell swiftly, a great weapon wielder had turned around and this time, I did not have the speed to traverse the gap.\n\nBut we won that first bout.\n\nAnd it was absolutely amazing.\n\nThe second turned in to more of a shield press, me against that same, Finnish fighter, and this time he was wiser, it was as if we pushed for ages, until we both fell off of the castle walls together.\n\nAfter the fight, the knight was elated, he thanked me for a great experience, and the day after, I heard from the man he had squired to that the knight I had offered my shield just could not stop talking about the tower battle and me and just how much fun he'd had.\n\nAt the end of the event, I gave the man one of my rings, because earlier that event, I had honestly considered quitting, but my spirit had been rekindled that day. The ring had some story, but it was time for me to let go of that past any how, and let the ring start a new mythology.\n\nThe knight too had something he'd wanted to give me and was glad I'd found him, he hurried me to his camp, reintroduced me to his wife (whom I'd met when they took photos of a chair I'd brought for my tent, they were woodworkers when they did not fight) and then he gave me the first favour his wife had ever embroidered for him.\n\nCeltic knots in red and teal, on a white square on a teal bag, made to slide on to a belt.\n\nThis bag now carries my fighter authorisation-card, and whenever I go to war, I make sure to keep it underneath my armour, and whenever I am hesitant to charge, I feel that sword hilt on my shoulder, and I hear his bright voice call out.\n\n\"Go.\"\n\n\\----------------------------------------\n\nA note: the SCA sits in that weird space between a larp and a reenactment event, the sport described above is called heavy combat and has rules more similar to airsoft (called hits, only a stout enough blow to your torso or head will kill you) with its own set of safety requirements for the armour worn.\n\nWe fight with rattan swords, neither steel, nor latex, armour ranges from steel to mail to leather to plastics to nothing but minimum protection, and the clothing worn ranges from painted bedsheets to handcrafted replicas of original historical survivals.\n\nKings and Queens are chosen through a tournament, knights are parts of the peerage (groups within each aspect of the hobby, raised for their knowledge, skill and ability to help others) and often the equivalent of black belts or senior team leaders and teachers (Depending on your background in sports).\n\nWe take names for the events, so that we can swear fealty and sign contracts without them being legally binding, some people will do this just because you have to, others will let it dictate their clothes, their equipment and their way of attending events.\n\nTo some, it is a festival for drinking and/or sports or just hanging out with friends, to others it's a step in to another world, with all the manners befitting their persona (much like a larp without an objective), to most of us, it is part of a recurring dream that we keep coming back to.\n\nIf this does not belong here, I apologise and will try to find a better venue for this post.",

        "text": "Back with this group, I could usually rely on them to behave and act according to their character, for better or worse. They knew I rewarded good In character roleplay, so even a pious monk who didn't accept reward money would still get something. This however meant that IC conflict wasn't entirely uncommon, but with the way every character was designed, this rarely led to bloodshed. However, this all changed when two mates of mine, Josh and Ragen made a paladin, and a thief.\n\nThe campaign we all wanted to do was a more city based affair, with the group wanting to revisit a city from a previous campaign since they got so little time to delve into it. This city was a holy one, with all kinds of good faiths...who weren't exactly on the best terms, and liked to claim ownership of relics other religions also laid claim on. This was the reason why a thief and paladin could work together, to a point. The main issue was the way they didn't see eye to eye on things, with bits of tension slowly bubbling up over time IC, with it all coming to a head one night after they had reclaimed an artifact from a fringe cult of a god who were trying to legitimize themselves. The rogue wanted to return the artifact for a price, while the paladin wanted to give it for free. Eventually they agreed to return it for free as they'd get a reward regardless, but the rogue and paladin weren't exactly happy with each other.\n\nThe next morning rolled around and it turned out the two of them had been drinking the entire night, so the cleric had to slap them both with spells to wake'm up before they carried on with the adventure. Over time the two got on better, with several moments having them really rely on and support each other, especially emotionally after it was discovered that the thieves religion was discovered to be a front for another dark god and he was forced to re-evaluate his life. Time went by and they became close friends...Then something more.\n\nThey had started to agree to share rooms, something a bit odd considering the men usually all slept together, but they kept private sometimes. And it wasn't until the party burst in on them one afternoon with the paladin drawing the thief naked that it was discovered, the two had become lovers. I didn't question it, the others did IC, I let them talk it out and work through things, being mindful of how heated the conversation might get, though we were all level headed about it. From then on we just...accepted the fact we had a homosexual couple in the group and carried on.\n\nAfter that session, I drew them both aside and told them that they should have dinner at my place so we could catch up and also discuss things for the game. I made us all some salad and stuff, not really that important, and told them up front that because we were dealing with a religious themed campaign, I needed to know how they would feel about including religious bigotry towards homosexuality, as that is a rather real thing and I wondered how they'd feel about tying it into the game. Then Josh said \"Sure, after all, we've been dealing with it for a while anyway.\" I wasn't really sure what he meant, so I asked. the two of them looked at me and then came out to me.\n\nThey had apparently been a couple for a little while now. Since before I started DMing the two, but they had apparently been worried i wouldn't accept them, so they kept it a secret. They tested the waters with their characters to see how I reacted and I never showed disgust or displeasure, so they figured now was a good a time as any. I believe my first response was \"you two are idiots...you do realize you could have been way less vague and obtuse about this, right? You didn't need to do this whole song and dance just to get an answer.\" They both shrugged and figured it was the most subtle way to do it. Naturally I bonked them both on the heads and told them to just be more honest with me, then served dinner.\n\nSo yea, two of my players were gay and tried to see if i was homophobic by roleplaying that in game. Not sure which is worse, the fact they thought I was, or the fact they felt the need to hide it. Either which way, kinda nice that they trusted me enough to open up like that. Still see them regularly as well, got their permission to post this story over drinks. Only reason I remembered this was because they joked about one of them being the others bear familiar.",

        "text": "Not all gods are created equally, and I'm not just talking about things like gods limited to a single planet or lesser gods, even the big almighty deities can be somewhat of a let down. This was the sad truth Sergei's cleric had to learn (Not his actual name.).   \n\n\nSergei's cleric was part of a viking warband who were sailing across the sea to brittany, where their people were intent upon claiming a part of the country for themselves, even if it meant facing off against the dreaded king arthur and his court of knights. The warband had been honing their skills in their native Scandinavia for a long time now, fighting other vikings, attempted holy invaders and even pitting themselves against a tribe of giants who had attempted to breach into our world from their realm of Jötunheimr. They had earned their wargear, and the favor of the gods, above all though, sergei's cleric, thor, was pleased with his bravery and prowess in combat. Granting him the boon of a summonable goat mount.\n\nThey arrived along the northern coasts, not scotland, just south of that. The location was chosen specifically because of the seaside towns and monasteries, both of which they attacked, looted, pillaged and slaughtered. The women and children were spared, and those men who were deemed useful (like monks who could teach them how to read and speak the native language) were kept alive. From there they built up defenses and made the monastery into a sort of fortress.\n\nIt was on a night of celebration in one of the largest halls in the town that they were paid a visit, not by one of the arthurian knights, not by any fae or army, but a displeased figure of faith. He was a small man dressed in simple white robes, having seemingly appeared out of nowhere in the great hall. With a soft voice he was seemingly able to address and silence the entire room, only to give them all a warning. They must leave the monastery, give up their gods, and return to spread the name of the one true christian faith, or face the wrath of god. The hall was still silent, a number of them looked worried, feeling this strange, intense aura coming from the old man. Even the party sensed it, but they, being a group of PC's in a campaign...didn't care and Sergei threw a hammer at the old man.\n\nThe hood flew back as the hammer was caught and crushed in his palm. the robes filled out, revealing a tall, towering man with flowing white hair and a long majestic beard. He had warned them, and they had spurned his forgiveness, now they would suffer the conseque-Another hammer was thrown. This time through the ceiling of the building and right onto the old mans head with a thunderous crack, plowing him into the ground and leaving a small crater. A hulking man with hair as red as the autumn leaves jumped in through the hole, picked up his hammer and announced for all to hear.\" None shall touch the children of Thor! Begone, god of christian faith and return to your poncy clouds before I smite you with the thunder from them!\"\n\nThe Christian god glared at Thor after standing up, then left on a beam of light.\" Know your place norseman, if not you or I shall punish them, then my servants shall.\" With that, they were left alone with Thor. Who proceeded to summon a massive kettle of ale and a pile of food before yelling.\"We celebrate as if this were valhalla, to remind you why we are viking, and to show you the favor I and my father show for this conquest!\" A cheer of celebration went up, and the party resumed.\n\nThis was the first proper time Sergei had ever gotten to talk to Thor, his idol, his god, his everything. And boy was he disappointed, he had expected a great, wise, boisterous warrior who's travels across the nine realms would make him capable of great insight. But because he was half pissed at t he time, and Thor, being Thor, wasn't really capable of any of this beyond half mocking his own cleric for getting in the way of his horn of ale. Throughout the night he tried to talk to Thor and learn something of insight, but the best he could do was rouse stories of his travels that were more comical than anything.\n\nWhen everyone else had passed out from booze, and all that remained was Thor who was finishing the food he had brought and the ale kettle he had with him, and Sergei's cleric, he made one last desperate plea. All Thor could really manage was to espouse some basic ideals every norseman knew and give a bit of advice about never trusting what things seemed to be on this island before launching himself out of the hole in the ceiling, which repaired itself. Strangely, the sack Thor had brought the food in was still full, as was the kettle. There was even a magical hammer inside the food bag when he reached in for some mutton.\n\nThor had tried to keep his followers faith, but to realize that your deity is not really an all knowing, wise warrior, but is instead more of a man with mighty power, can dishearten even the most stouthearted of faithful. Next session rolled around and his cleric disowned thor privately and took to praying to the rest of the pantheon, hoping for a sign from a wise god, one who would help him become wiser as well as stronger, to do more than just fight and die...He heard the christian gods words begin to echo in his head, but those he just outright shunted from his head without a second thought and made it very clear that wasn't going to happen. So, without any other to answer him, he lost his clerical abilities, he lost faith.\n\nInstead of letting him play as a useless cleric, I allowed him to play as a normal fighter who was several levels lower than the rest of the party in some regards (he kept his saves, his HP pool and a few other things, but he was basically a 7th level fighter instead of a 10th level cleric). He was like this for a while, an athiest not by choice, but by abandonment. He did not miss Thor, but he still wanted a god who was wise of mind and strong of arm. In the end though, someone approached him in the night, one bowl of wine too many having lulled him into a stupor.  \n\n\nHe was met by a strange man of sallow skin and rich purple robes, carrying a bowl in one hand and a harp in the other. This figure did not introduce himself by name, but by answering a question that had been eating at the cleric for years, death does have meaning in this world even if there is life in the next, because what you die as dictates what you come back as, and in order to produce the best wine, the sweetest grapes must be harvested. They sat down and drank, going right into reincarnation, life and death, eventually touching upon themes of madness and its nature, with wine playing an important part in a good number of this beings metaphors.\n\nWhen asked for his name, the being paused and looked rather puzzled, only then did he give an account of his \"name\". He had been adopted and dropped by many pantheons over the years, once pagen and mostly isolated, then as a cult, then he joined with the pantheon of the greeks, who were later consumed by rome, though he still remained largely separate from them. He had no single name, but he simply told Sergei to address him as dionysus for the sake of ease. Most of this went over sergei's clerics head because he didn't know who the greeks were, or what a 'rome' was, but he was willing to learn.  \n\n\nThus the viking cleric of thor became a worshipper of the mad god of death and rebirth, dionysus. Not the greek version, not the rome version, but a mish mash of all the versions I could find of him all smashed together. From then on, sergei's cleric would drink wine in meditation in order to physically and spiritually connect to his almighty deity.",

So we go through the forge to the mine, get to the mine. We then explore a little more to find some kobold attire for addressing the dragon and the dragon. So the paladin puts on this attire and addresses her while the rest of the party goes and sneaks around. The paladin is playing it off that he is a kobold who went and made a deal with the dwarves that they would work together. I happened to walk around the corner and started to play along that I was this dwarf that the 'kobold' had made a deal with. The paladin 'kobold' then proceeds to gets the dragon to walk up to him, as she does that I took my glaive and stabbed her twice(crit once, action surged and stabbed her some more, I ended up doing about 47 damage to her. At that the artificer's construct then comes around the corner, the artificer cast enlarge on it, and the construct proceeds to grapple the dragon. We all then start to wail on her with the paladin attempting to knocker prone, failing both times. Then it gets around to my turn since we got a surprise round and I attempt to knock her prone succeeding, and then I stabbed her again. The rest of the team proceeds to wail on her and all 5 of us end up getting her to about 28 hp by the sorcerer's turn, right before the dragon's. The paladin then begins to talk about how we could keep her alive and use her for work, we weren't buying her agreement. Then the sorcerer then walked up to her and cursed her in dragonic (he hates chromatic dragons) and cast inflict wound and crit, this killed her.\n\n\nShe had not one chance to do anything before we dealt all of her hp in damage. I took the head and made a helmet from it and changed my name from Morgas Copperhelm to Morgas Dragonhelm. The sorcerer had a wonderful idea for what to do with her wings and that was to use them to make a cape, so he took one wing and I took the other.\n\n\nTL;DR: We distracted a dragon, then surprised her and then before she had a turn to act we dealt literally all of her hp right before it was her turn again.\n\nEdit; Formatting",

        "text": "[Previous](https://redd.it/8yzefj)\n\nSixfinger the goblin alchemist did not like legends. He did not like cosmic decrees, he did not like being called upon to go on epic adventures, and most of all, Sixfinger *hated* the idea of being forced to do something by fate. Which is why he was more than a little freaked out when he found *a statue of himself* in an old ruin that the party was investigating.\n\nThe party had been hired to look into this old place and figure out why the thing was so freaky and weird. Sixfinger immediately named himself 'security detail' and took himself out to a safe distance and refused to examine anything, in case 'destins-y' snuck up on him and informed him it was his divine duty to slay the evil lord whatsisface. And so, the rest of the party set about examining their oddly appropriate symbols (Star charts for Starchild the blade-sorcerer, music notes for Boris the bard, and absolutely jack shit for Raghnall the evil necromancer). The party proceeded to poke about and mess with things until they nearly gave their questgiver a heart attack by messing around with some bizarre lighting that summoned some supernatural shadows. Oh, and the woman got amnesia, too, and promptly forgot she was going to pay us. *Great job, guys*. At least they figured out that the ruin had somehow been created by orcs.\n\nSpeaking of orcs! The party had a bit of a surprise when their dicking around with eldritch shit was interrupted by a flood of refugees from a nearby town that had been ransacked. Sixfinger looked over to Raghnall, who had done EXACTLY this sort of shit before, but this time his suspicions proved premature- the town had been leveled by an orc! Just ONE orc. And there were dozens of casualties and people with bleeding holes in their bodies needing treatment.\n\nBecause Boris, who usually handled healing, had fucked off somewhere (absent player), things were left to Sixfinger and his unique goblin approach to medicine, and *Raghnall*, who, again, was a spooky necromantic asshole who specialized in channeling negative energy, with skeletal minions and a sinister plague doctor motif, and was *an acolyte of a dark god of evil and suffering*. It was amazing that there were only three deaths.\n\nCome the next day, Raghnall and Sixfinger were regarded as heroes and stand-up individuals, though naturally the one in the doctor mask with his 'healing' abilities (read: Using necromancy to temporarily turn his patients undead, then channeling negative energy) was given most of the credit. And so, Raghnall began to pepper the refugees with questions. Like, for instance, who among the group was the strongest. And fastest. And had the best bone structure. And if anyone had heard of the lord and savior, the dark god of suffering and death.\n\nSixfinger, who knew where THIS line of questioning was going, not-so-subtly reminded Raghnall that now was not the time to turn people into skeletons. It was, in fact, possible that there was NEVER a time to turn people into skeletons. And that a LACK of skeletons would be good for Raghnall's continued well-being. Raghnall, of course, ignored this and set up a covert meeting with the leader of the refugees in a nearby clearing, in the wee hours of the morning. Without telling anyone. For purely non-skeleton-related purposes, *trust me*.\n\nSo Sixfinger stalked his ass like a jilted ex-wife.\n\nRaghnall set up a small ceremony out in the woods, began asking the refugee leader even more probing and creepy questions, while drawing up a ritual circle and pulling out a jet-black spellbook adorned with teeth. And as Raghnall reached out to the hesitant man, Sixfinger made the only rational decision- he exploded out of the bush, hucking firebombs directly into Raghnall's face with the aid of a true strike serum, screaming bloody murder and telling the necromancer that **HE DONE FUCKED UP, SHITBRAINS**. \n\nFor some reason, this did not give the appropriate impression that Sixfinger was a heroic savior, rescuing the man from a skeleton-y fate and saving the day. In fact, the refugee leader was under the impression that he and this charming doctor fellow were under attack by a crazed mutant goblin firebomber. The fact that the man was nursing some second-degree burns and shrapnel wounds from the backblast might have had something to do with that, but Sixfinger didn't have time for this 'critical thinking' shit and eschewed any thoughts of subtlety and restraint while focusing all of his efforts on screaming bloody murder, hucking MORE firebombs, and running around like a demented weasel.\n\nRaghnall managed to keep himself healed just enough to stave off a fiery, explodey death- or at least, long enough to attract the attention of the rest of the party. As he fled, being helped along by the damn refugee, the skeletal minion of Raghnall managed to trip up Sixfinger just enough so that he couldn't throw ONE LAST bomb and end the slimy little necromantic fuck once and for all. And then, with a cry of 'WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE', Starchild arrived on the scene, sword drawn and magic readied, and everyone on the scene froze in place like naughty children.\n\nSixfinger and the silent (heavily disguised) skeletal minion were shuffled off into a corner and instructed to do and touch absolutely nothing, and Raghnall was asked some very pointed questions. Namely, what the hell was he doing in the woods, without telling anyone, with one of the refugees, at 4 AM. And also, why was Sixfinger hurling bombs at him. Raghnall claimed that this was all a perfectly normal situation, that he has just wanted to ~~abduct~~ induct this poor man into his religion, that he had been nothing but upright and honest with the party, that he meant no ill will, and while he *might* be a necromancer, he'd certainly never do anything evil or sinister. And, as a character witness, the refugee leader would speak on his behalf, telling Starchild that it had all been perfectly benign until Sixfinger had *completely unfairly* started hucking bombs around.\n\nExcept that the refugee wouldn't speak on his behalf. On account of Raghnall's arm had been possessed by the furious spirits of all the people he had killed, and was *actively strangling the refugee*. Yeah, awkward.\n\nThinking quickly, Raghnall decided to take drastic action, and ordered his skeletal minion to charge in and sever his possessed arm. Sixfinger contributed by applauding, shovelling popcorn into his mouth, and holding up a crude scorcard, all at the same time. The arm was successfully severed, and Raghnall once again tried his 'this isn't what it looks like' argument, except that Starchild had stopped listening and moved on to shooting people with magic. Unfortunately, Raghnall aced the save against being stunned, and ran pell-mell for the group of refugees that thought so highly of him, while Starchild followed him, proclaiming that the time of his necromantic bullshit was at an end and firing off tiny meteors and magic missiles. Sixfinger, meanwhile, shared a significant glance with the skeletal-minion, and offered him some more popcorn.\n\nWhen, predictably, Starchild failed to convince a bunch of people that their hero and savior (who was covered in burns, cuts, and missing an arm) was in fact an evil dick, using absolutely zero evidence by the way, Starchild reluctantly decided that it was time to NOT get lynched by an angry mob. The dour man ran back to Sixfinger, who was currently shoving Raghnall's severed arm into his pack, and the two decided that it was time to perform a tactical retreat. The two fell back to a safe distance, took a moment to regain some spells, then decided to head back and firebomb/magic missile the necromantic dickbag to death from a safe distance. Unfortunately, Raghnall countered this brilliant strategy with the equally brilliant tactic of not being there. Yep, the fucker and all of the refugees had fucked off to god knows where, probably to do something necromantic and sinister. Starchild and Sixfinger tried to pursue, but one nat-1 survival roll later, they were thoroughly lost, and lamenting how they'd just let an evil cult leader and necromancer of some dark god get away and probably do some horrific and eldritch fuckery. Or, Starchild was doing that. Sixfinger was filing the events away as 'not his problem' and 'not his fault', and looking for a way to graft Raghnall's severed arm to his torso, so that he could have FOUR of the things!\n\nNot having anything better to do, the two remaining party members made their way toward the ruined village that all the refugees had fled from, in the hopes of salvaging SOME information from this horrible clusterfuck.",

        "text": "[Previous](https://redd.it/8tflaa)\n\nSixfinger the goblin alchemist was having a strange day. He had arrived on the outskirts of town two days ago, and eventually came within the city limits after learning that A: making bizarre, rancid-smelling chemicals while skulking in a bush just outside a guard outpost was generally frowned upon, and B: there were buildings inside the town for doing this exact thing. Wait, seriously? There are spaces where people WON'T yell at you for distilling sulphuric acid from an ogre's entrails? Hot damn, maybe there was something to this 'society' thing after all. He then touched up his clever disguise as a halfling (plaster paste over the skin and a dirty mop for hair, GENIUS) and entered the town without any further difficulty.\n\nSixfinger then whiled away his time, striking up conversations with busy guild leaders (his favorite sort of people, they generally did not give a shit about why a goblin was talking to them, and didn't ask stupid questions like 'why are you carrying a sack of bombs' and 'is that an ogre brain in a jar'). But when the bounty listings turned out to require memberships and the only odd jobs he could find involved retrieving lost pets from trees, he quickly grew bored and sought ways to pad his business. By hurling various small animals into trees and then offering to get them down.\n\nThankfully, the guards were NOT called, though several angry 'customers' took issue with Sixfinger's 'unique' solution to pet retrieval (read: hucking water balloons at them until they fell). But then, the idiot necromancer Raghnall arrived, with two new players in tow- Starchild, a half-elven sorta-magus, and Boris, a half-elven sorta-bard. And naturally, once introductions were complete, Sixfinger asked Raghnall if he had burned down any more villages on the way here.\n\nDid I mention that Boris and Starchild were hired to look into the destruction of the little village that Raghnall had destroyed at the beginning of the campaign?\n\nAnd that Sixfinger had witnessed the entire thing?\n\nAnd had *no intention* of making things easy or pleasant for Raghnall?\n\nThrough a heroic effort on Raghnall's part (which consisted of telling the other party members that Sixfinger was a chronic drunkard and prone to hallucinations), he managed to quiet the suspicions a fair bit, and then blatantly changed the subject by suggesting that they check out the local guilds and historical museums and whatnot. As the two new party members dithered over where to go and who to talk to, Sixfinger informed Raghnall that he would be going *absolutely nowhere* without supervision, and the not-actually-drunk-mad-scientist-goblin-posing-as-halfling proceeded to stalk the nervous-looking necromancer all around the city. From a distance of five feet. At all times. *While he was actively mixing poisons, potions, and explosives.* Sixfinger was not particularly subtle.\n\nBoris, though, had discovered a museum devoted to musical craft and strange instruments. And, since Boris had practically formed his outfit out of various musical accessories (seriously, he'd spent *half his starting cash* on nothing but instruments and bizarre gizmos to help play them), he immediately became enamored with the place, and with its curator, a fiesty old woman who was lamenting that people weren't all that interested in hearing the shpiel about the accursed flute of Cirrius Flat or whatever. So Boris immediately set about attempting to revitalize the town's interest in the musical arts, by... playing music. At people who were sick of hearing about music. When this failed to get the overwhelming explosion of joy and cash he desired, Boris paid a significant amount out of his own pocket to help the museum, and inquired if the curator needed any assistance in keeping the place afloat. After all, he had unexpectedly found a group of capable individuals who could perhaps do some dangerous and interesting tasks for her!\n\nCURATOR: \"Well, now that you mention it...\"\n\nWith that, the party had officially gotten their first quest. Not wanting to jump into things too quickly, we all decided to stay at an inn for the night. Whereupon several things were discovered! First, Boris was quite capable of speaking the Halfling language, and Sixfinger... was not. Second, Boris was absolutely terrified of goblins, convinced that they were some sort of horrible monstrous boogeyman. The combination of these facts resulted the third discovery- that Sixfinger could accurately gauge the effectiveness of his disguise by measuring how loudly the man screamed when Sixfinger walked up to him. Very scientific.\n\nWhile Sixfinger was distracted, Raghnall made his move. Using all of his cunning skill, he hurled himself and his skeletal minion out of the inn's second-story window, then rushed to the graveyard under cover of night to desecrate some bodies. Unfortunately, the unearthed body he painstakingly dug up was blessed somehow, and his equipment was all imbued with holy magic, which made the entire affair almost completely pointless. So Raghnall settled for showing blatant disrespect for the dead man, stealing the holy weapons (after wrapping them in protective blankets to prevent alignment-related divine retribution) and hauled ass back to the in before Sixfinger the murdernanny could realize he was absent.\n\nThen, at long last, the adventure began in earnest! Sixfinger, Starchild, Boris, and Raghnall all packed their gear and headed out... WITH the fiesty old curator in tow! They were headed to some sort of nearby ruin. But on the way, they were halted by a strange sight... A dead woman, lying in the middle of the path.\n\nSIXFINGER: \"This a trap.\"\n\nSTARCHILD: \"Absolutely a trap.\"\n\nRAGHNALL: \"Without question a trap.\"\n\nBORIS: \"How can you be so certain? She may just be in need of assistance!\"\n\nCURATOR: \"No, idiot boy. It's most definitely a trap. I've seen plenty of bandit ambushes in my day, and this is most definitely one.\"\n\nNot wanting to blow our cover too early, Starchild and Boris set about playing up concerned adventurers while the rest of the party casted various spells in order to prepare for combat. Sixfinger, for his part, blew every single one of his extracts on becoming the sneakiest bastard possible, ninja-ing across the field to get a good view of all the bandits, then positioning himself directly behind the bandit leader before using every buff he had to become the biggest, meanest sunuvabitch he could possibly be... and slammed two oversized hands onto the bandit leader's shoulders, while a third hideous mutant arm clutched a lit bomb.\n\n\"***HEY GUYS! WHAT WE DOING!?***\"\n\nThings rapidly went to shit for the bandits. We had the surprise, the buffs, the combat ability, and the sheer overwhelming force of spells, swords, tiny meteors, summoned creatures, and hurled explosives. The bandits didn't stand a chance. In fact, they didn't stand a chance *so hard* that not a single party member took damage, and we got two captives out of the deal, including the bandit leader.\n\nThe captives were gathered up and tied up, and after Raghnall had a go at brutal torture (to the horror of the other party members, and Sixfinger's amusement), the bandits were questioned about their methods, motives, and activities. And after a magnificently retarded argument about whether an ambush 'counts' if it was immediately overriden with a counter-ambush, the party devolved into a shouting match over whether to unilaterally kill the bandits (Raghnall) or 'bring them to justice' (Boris and Starchild). It was pointed out that we weren't in any area where hard laws applied, all the evidence was circumstantial, and what the fuck were we going to do with two uncooperative captives? Sixfinger spectated on the argument while eating some truly spectacularly unpleasant-smelling rations, and carefully injecting commentary to keep the two sides in a constant state of outraged indignation. Unfortunately, this was brought to an end when the Curator shot both of the bandits in the head with her crossbow, and told everyone to 'quit your stupid dithering and get on with it, we've got shit to do'. Sixfinger decided he rather liked the old curator, and made a mental note to brew up some interesting alchemical things for the sprightly old woman.\n\nAt long last, the party trudged its way to the edge of the ruins, and prepared to investigate the odd place in the name of fame, loot, music, and possibly horrible necromantic gods of evil and suffering. Who knows what horrors we will find, or more likely, create?",

        "text": "Players familiar with Savage Worlds might know that the \"Savage\" title is well-earned. Due to the system's \"ace\" mechanic, in which dice that roll the maximum value are re-rolled for additional effect, there is no finite limit on the amount of damage a single attack can do! Nobody is safe when a low-level mook has a tiny but non-zero chance to one-shot-kill even the most legendary heroes.\n\nI finished up a two year campaign set in a homebrew Savage World setting a while ago and I've accrued quite a few stories of ridiculous damage rolls in that time, and nearly all were at the hands of one particular player. In this thread I'll be posting some of the stories from this character. As a quick disclaimer, we didn't always play by the rules in this campaign. Due to some ~~GM mistakes~~ artistic rule interpretations, our game ended up being particularly deadly, with higher damage rolls and more deadly injuries.\n\nWithout futher ado:\n\nMeet the Healer: an ex-cultist/beekeeper with anemia, a bad leg, a whopping 4 toughness, and a proclivity for absolutely obscene dice rolls. Very emotional, very naive, occasionally stupid, and always entertaining, the healer was accompanied by a curmudgeonly old man, with whom he enjoyed a constant uncomfortable rivalry fraught with mutual near-murders, and a priest/prophet, with whom he enjoyed a sweet but often very weird adoptive mother/son kind of relationship fraught with mutual crying sessions and arguments over the ethics of nec-romancing his zombie cyborg boyfriend back to life.\n\n* [This was a previous story from the same game](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/5umvhy/the_grave_robbers_and_the_tale_of_the_very_sad/) That player in question? The healer.\n\n* On one occasion, the healer was doing his job as the healer: a player with a single wound was the recipient of a healing roll of something like 23. (For reference, a 4 is the standard target number in Savage Worlds) The resulting burst of healing energy basically incinerated the zombies surrounding them and put everyone at full health.\n\n* After narrowly escaping a near death experience involving a cursed snowglobe, an ice lake, and a poor agility roll, this physically inept and badly fatigued healer left the snowglobe to find themselves the victim of an incredibly cruel practical joke that I'd inserted, not really appreciating the gravity of the situation. Upon realizing the prank, they responded by punching the nearest person as hard as they could. This person happened to be a child. The healer rolls an unarmed attack, something they are both utterly unskilled in and utterly unsuited for with the minimum strength of d4. Something like 30 damage later, the child has taken 6 wounds in a game where 4 instantly incapacitates any character. Poor kid. He had to spend quite a bit of time in the hospital after that.\n\n* The most damage the healer ever did in a single action was a particularly crazy incident. They had just picked up an edge that reduced the cost of magical abilities when they rolled well - and christ did they ever. In a throwaway fight against three low level mooks, the healer decided to go all out, spending over half of his magic reserves to cast a super-charged triple-bolt, probably the most blatantly overpowered thing in the Savage Worlds rulebook. The Bolt spell does 2d6 damage for each bolt up to 3, and each one can be super-charged to kick it up to 3d6. So when you collate damage rolls like I (mistakenly) did at the time, we were looking at 9d6 damage! 9d6, in a game where getting shot by a gun deals 2d6+1!... *if*, I reminded the healer, all 3 attack rolls passed. Well. Our healer rolled all 3 of those attack rolls and rolled not one but *two* raises (think a critical hit) on *all three of the attacks.* A raise grants an extra 1d6 damage, meaning that this Novice level healer with a single spell, dealt ***15d6*** damage, that's ***fifteen dee six***. They did 58 damage in a single hit. The kicker? With that spell cost reduction edge, 6 raises means the entire 58 points of damage cost them not a single point of magic.\n\nThose of you who have played Savage Worlds, what are some of the craziest rolls you've seen?",

        "text": "I was twelve years old in the first game, and basically just saw [Krusk](https://i.imgur.com/4Un7G1z.png) in the PHB and decided to make him for the first game. That game was fairly interesting but we lost his sheet after I managed to steal a Black Dragon Egg at level 4 and then built a small fortress in the woods and refused to go adventuring again until the baby dragon hatched.\n\nInstead I decided to roll up a Dwarf Fighter and play as Gimli, but with more shields. The details of the campaign are vague to me but I remember that my Cousin decided to make a DMPC to join me both so I'd be less likely to die but also because he wanted to keep me from becoming a hermit again in-game.\n\nWell, my Cousin was also 14, and though he did a pretty good job for the most part as a DM (at least to my mind back then), the DMPCs that would populate this game and our future games would continue to be an issue. \n\nIn this game, he basically made a Legolas to join me, an Elven fighter/wizard multiclass that was aiming to go the route of the Arcane Archer. I met him in a shady corner in the tavern, as one does in this classic-style games. The adventure went on rather well for most of the game, fighting goblins, saving a maiden or two, out-drinking him, and so forth.\n\nBy the time we were level 7 or so, he was able to grab the first one or two levels in AA and I had a big ol' tower shield and was planning to grab the Dwarven Defender prestige class soon after. The sticking point for this game was the tournament we entered, which I still remember vividly to this day (12 years later).\n\nWe came to a massive city that had a central coliseum, and a young red dragon ruled the populace and watched the fights with delight, the people of the city over three generations matching his cruelty and viciousness and wanting to see more and more blood as time went on.\n\nAs a Lawful Neutral warrior-dwarf (and a child with dubious morality) I saw all this as bad-ass and demanded we join in the festivities as combatants, as my cousin had expected. He prepared brackets and we entered the team-duels, just the two of us. You may be guessing what will occur.\n\nNot-Gimli took on any of the warriors, turning into a short iron wall that head-butted and hacked his way to victory, while Not-Legolas picked off any of the archers or spell-casters so they couldn't turn the tide against Not-Gimli. We fought humans, half-orcs, elves, gnolls, and even a team of gnomes that were piloting golems like mini-gundams.\n\nTimes were fun, until we won and the dragon declared that we must duel each other to determine the true winner of the tourney. We started on opposite sides of a two-hundred foot arena. I figured even with the distance I had an advantage having super-high AC and close combat abilities...\n\nHe rolled behind his screen and wouldn't show me the results when three arrows struck me on my move actions towards him. I had the health to make it through, but didn't want to risk a critical. Once I reached the elf, I would've won the fight. So, I used my shield's innate ability to provide full cover and moved towards him with it out in front.\n\nAs I moved at him, he loosed an arrow that \"missed\" only for it to spin around and stab my character in the back for a critical hit. My health went down to 0. He said it was an Arcane Archer ability. I was furious and demanded to see the die, he said no. So I said I wanted to see the DMG so I could read the ability myself, he said no. I threatened to not play anymore and he said \"well it was only going to knock you unconscious, but now your character is dead.\"\n\nFor those who don't know, at best his character had two levels in Arcane Archer, and a critical from his arrow would not have killed my fighter at the time (he had a LOT of health). I checked the Arcane Archer later and \"Seeker Arrow\" which ignores cover, doesn't appear until one has four levels in AA. What's worse, \"Arrow of Death\" the only ability in his theoretical reptoire that could have down my Dwarf at that point, doesn't show up until **Level 10** as an AA and I never got to make a Fortitude Save like its ability implies.\n\nAfter I had found it in his book on a subsequent visit, I showed him and called him out on it, and he apologized and said he wouldn't make our in-game characters ever have to fight again. Which he didn't and we had warm memories of our campaigns after, despite how his characters continued to be overpowered and he leaned more and more to homebrew by later games.\n\nAs bad as the story may seem, we did have fun after it all. We had a subsequent Evil-alignment game where I played an Assassin and he played a Vampire. And an additional game where I played as a Fallen Angel with a homebrew soul-warrior class and he made a Naruto-esque monk with \"poisonous chakra\" which we actually got to level 20 in (albeit with expedited EXP).\n\nNeedless to say his DMPCs always overshadowed my characters mechanically, but I didn't care. Luckily the experience taught me to never do anything of the same with any NPCs or GMPCs I would put in future games, and taught me to be careful with balancing everyone's fun.",

        "text": "Our campaign takes place on the newly discovered continent of Dax, a land ruled by Dragons and Dragonborn families in which non-draconic races are oppressed and often enslaved. The invention of the airship in the kingdom of Faloran led to the discovery of the continent, far across the sea. \n\nSeeing it as fertile land to conquer, the government of Faloran sent airships over to start an insurgency, having been told by spies of the situation of Draconic supremacy. The intention was to send in agents of Faloran to create unrest in Dax and overthrow the draconic government, making the continent of Dax a vassal state to the Kingdom of Faloran.\n\nOver in Faloran’s capitol city, a young man by the name of William Burke was arrested, a criminal known to operate in an underground crime syndicate, though a successful sting operation found the syndicate taken down and William was sentenced to hang for his crimes. However, the state decided that instead his skills could be used over in Dax. William was given an ultimatum - to either leave behind his whole life and join the Dax insurgency or hang on the gallows pole.\n\nNaturally, William took the first option, and to Dax he went though reluctant and displeased with the situation. He didn’t originally get on with the team he was assigned to, often on close watch due to his known offences and his disposition on the situation. He often lied about coin and treasure he found, scheming for a way to set up a comfortable life on the continent without risking his life for the group. Through a series of events, the team found themselves overthrowing a single Dragonborn family and taking a city in the south east of Dax.\n\nSurprising even himself, William had warmed to the group. He realised his survival depended upon them, and theirs his. He learnt to trust them, and became stronger for it. In their conquered city, however, their installed Dragonborn puppet leader seemed off. Having done some peacekeeping work with him to stop the overthrown Dragonborn from rebelling, the group became suspicious of the Prime Minister they had installed, and they snuck into his house - the castle that housed the Dragon Prince Karthax whom they had slain many months before. They discovered a lockbox that was linked to the ethereal plane, and they had to go into the ethereal plane to recover what was in the lockbox, something they knew was powerful necromantic magic. \n\nThey took with them an Arcanist from the insurgency, and had the high priest of the city transport them to the ethereal plane, following them to the plane to allow them to leave when they were done, warning them that he cannot take them from this plane back home until he had rested. The group found themselves in a replica of the material plane, though ghostly and spectral in appearance.\n\nThey made their way past many dangers and into the room where they found the lockbox on the material plane, but inside the castle was danger they never expected.\n\nThe rage filled spirit of Karthax resided upon the ethereal plane, and they had awoken it in their spectral heist. The group escaped the castle, with the ghost dragon on their tail, making their way into the ethereal projection of the city and to the High Priest, who could not take them back to the material plane yet. The group tried to sneak through the empty, though overhanging streets, hoping the rooves would obscure their visage from the dragon roaming in the skies looking for them.\n\nIt didn’t obscure them enough, and they where spotted. The group broke into the first house they could, attempting to find the basement. It took them enough time for Karthax to have already been tearing the house apart, finding the entrance to the basement. Escape seemed unlikely, and we would be unable to fight Karthax this time. We had less men and less preparation than our first encounter with the dragon prince. The high priest came up with an ingenious idea - he could cast Banishment on the party and send them back to the material plane. Except there was four people to send home, and he only had enough power to banish three beings. \n\nBy now, Karthax had found them out, and was preparing to break in and burn the party alive. William Burke knew what had to be done. Bursting forth from their hiding place, loosing an arrow at the startled dragon prince, the human ran as fast as his legs could carry him, taunting the dead dragons spirit as he ran. “I killed you, I killed you!”.\n\nThe high priest used this opportunity to banish the rest of the party back to the material plane, leaving himself and William to their fates. One failed dexterity save later, and William Burke was nothing more than a cinder left, drifting upon the ethereal plane.\n\n[ This was the first ever character I played in D&amp;D, or any table top RPG. I was pleased with his character arc, which lasted over a year in real time, from feckless loner to sacrificing himself for the lives of his friends and companions. So, I thought I’d share! Hope you liked it. I, for one, am looking forward to creating my next character!]",

The bard RPs most of a solid stand-up routine and slapstick juggles some laughs out of the tense tavern later that night. The rogue keeps the party going for everyone. The fighter and druid rough up one of her thugs who was staking out a half-orc home declaring the half-orcs under their protection. Sentiments turn more sympathetic towards the half-orcs.\n\nThey find out that Dara is a bit superstitious and is a devout follower of Ehlonna, who has a temple in town, and prays daily just before lunch. The party disguise the grave cleric (of the Raven Queen) in Ehlonna's image and the bard glamours the reflecting pool to have cryptic and metaphorical messages displayed while she prays. Out pops \"Ehlonna\" and points back towards the Stone Tooth, then misty steps her way out of sight.\n\nNot an hour later Dara and her main crew of ruffians are declaring the town forfeit and lost. Dara and her crew will be leaving to hunt orcs in the forest and finish off what the party started. Never again will they return as long as the town insists to harbor the swampskins. They turn to the road and middle fingers wave goodbye to their backs.\n\nI love my players.",
