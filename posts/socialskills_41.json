It's usually nothing serious, but she often rubs me on the arm when she's talking to me or just passes me in the hallways at work. She's also told me on a couple of occasions that I look great and suggested I get on Tinder (in response to my saying I hadn't met many new people on the area). \n\nSo. At the risk of seemingly totally socially stunted, do you think these are signs of romantic interest or just kindess/friendship?",

        "text": "I overthink before I speak, so I think about the sentences first in my head and fix possible grammatical errors. If I don’t feel confident enough to speak up, I just end up not talking at all. However, it’s stressful, and I hate myself for not being able to speak fluently about my opinions or just talk to people in general. I feel stupid and dumb. I am bilingual and feel more comfortable speaking sentences in Korean but with a mix of English words. I think I’m a slow thinker too. When I have team projects, I always agree with other ideas and conform to what the majority says. I am too afraid to speak up because of the thought of my ideas sounding too simple or dumb. \n\nIn the past, Korean friends would correct grammatical mistakes in the sentences I spoke but in a demeaning way, if that makes sense. For example, they would repeat what I just said with a mocking tone, and I would ask what’s wrong and they would say, “nothing.” It could be something that’s not a big deal, but the friend did it several times, so the experience still haunts me. \n\nThat was long. Tbh, I am not sure what I want to get out of this post, but I’d like to hear some advice or any similar experiences people here had. I hope my story makes sense.",

Some of us had been talking about playing an RPG together for a while and I was really excited about it. Until last night when I saw on Instagram that they had gotten together to play without me. \n\nI reached out and shared that I was feeling hurt and confused about why I wasn’t included. They apologized and said it was a miscommunication and that they weren’t intentionally leaving me out. I said that I trusted it wasn’t intentional, but it still felt bad as I thought that this was something we were going to do together and had even directly asked to be invited. I explained that I struggle to feel like I belong sometimes since they have all known each other longer than me, and that I had really been looking forward to sharing an experience together that we could bond over. \n\nI feel like I was polite and direct, I used a lot of “I” statements and didn’t make any accusations or anything like that. But I still have this feeling like I ruined something or shouldn’t have spoken up. I’m worried that I came off like an entitled loser or something. \n\nWas there a better way I could have handled this?",

In fact I basically didn't talk most of it; only really spoke when I was forced into group work.\n\nSecond semesters going a lot better though. For P.E a group of kids invited me to play with them (first week we basically just have a free class). The group I was invited to on the first day consisted of 3 other kids one of them is from Mexico but knows English for the most part.\n\nI hang out with the other kids and the third day the Mexican girl invited me to walk around with her other friends; my school is mostly Hispanic and a lot of them are immigrants so her other friends are mostly the other immigrants. The other kids don't know English that well but, they're really nice and I like hanging out with them. It's just the language barriers a little difficult. They try to include me; the one girl that knows English talks to me the most the other kids do try to talk to me with the limited English they know as well but, it's still a little difficult.\n\nThis is just one instance tho; I have a lot of classes where I end up working with someone who doesn't speak the same language as me and I'll usually end up really liking them and wanting to be closer with them but, I just can't really interact with them that well.\n\nAny advice on this? I know an obvious one would be learning Spanish (working on that) but, that takes a lot of time and I'm wondering what I do in the mean time since most of the people I've happend to talk to don't really speak English and I really like hanging out with them.",

He has many friends and I don't. But he insists that he wants all of his friends to be friends with each other.\n\nSo, I got invited to hang out at the gym with his group of friends. I like being physically active but at the comfort of my home so this was a new experience for me. When I got there, I immediately retreated into being shy and did not speak much. It didn't help that there were a bunch of dominating personalities there who already had a bond with each other, so it felt like I had an uphill battle to deal with by trying to fit in.\n\nAlso, when I tried to talk, it felt as if I was being ignored at times so that didn't help my self confidence in the moment. Needless to say, it was made aware to me that they were gonna hang out again next week at the gym but the person I was becoming friends with did not extend an invite to me.\n\nSo, now I'm feeling insecure and disappointed in myself for not talking more but I also know that I never done something like this. I want to hang out with them again and be better but I don't think I'm gonna get that chance again.\n\nDo y'all think I'm overthinking my actions and judging myself too harshly or does this potential friend not want to hang out with me anymore because my inability to be social? Or both? What are your thoughts on this?",

Like im afraid to disagree. I love to watch history dokumentaries, play games and read books but my last book i read was 3 months ago or even longer. I love lovecraft stories but havent read any of them in so long. I have no motivation to do that anymore. I try to speak my mind on things but in the end i just shut off and stay silent to not cause a ruckus. I dont know anymore. Did i even like these things in the first place or was a trying to label myself? Is this even part of who i am or is it just some random likes i got and there is no more under it then that?

        "text": "I (24F) have been at my current job for about 6 months now. I work on a hybrid schedule like most people in the office. Everyone once in a while I’ll get a LinkedIn request from a coworker and I’ll always accept it because why the heck not, we work together. On Sunday a man at my work who we’ll call Steven (50ishM), and who has worked at my organization for about 20 years now, sent me a LinkedIn request 3 days ago on Sunday which I accepted. Then he messaged me after I accepted to say he was so glad to connect and “there are so many new folx, sometimes I forget names. Glad to know yours!” He asked me how I came to our organization and I told him. I assumed this would end there.\n\n\nI don’t work on the same team as Steven, but our teams do fall under a larger umbrella and we are on some of the same monthly meetings and quarterly retreats. We just had a retreat and we were in a brainstorming group together, but other than that I have never spoken to him. I don’t even think I directly addressed him in that group.\n\nThe next day, on Monday, Steven messages me on Teams and said good morning and I thought it was sort of strange because casual conversation isn’t really what Teams is meant for. I said good morning back. He remarked that the weather was nice and I agreed. Then he asked “maybe let’s have a drink together sometime. If not, that’s fine too.” After a few minutes he wrote “just wanted to put that out there….” I have gone out for drinks with coworkers and team members twice before in groups, but never as a one-on-one. I wanted to give him a the benefit of the doubt, but my gut feeling is uneasy. I approached one of my trusted coworkers, Randy (27M) who has been at our organization longer and I asked for his advice. He thought it was really strange and out of character for Steven, who apparently isn’t the type to be overly, innocently friendly. Randy is also gay if that helps to know for context and perspective. Randy and I agreed that it would be good for me to reply with a question asking if Steven was thinking of getting a group together for drinks. So I asked that and Steven replied that we can do that and “we’ll make it happen.”\n\nToday, Wednesday, we had a big organization-wide meeting and afterwards he messaged me on teams asking “we’re you in the meeting this a.m.?” At this point I don’t want to talk to him and I don’t know how I should move forward. I want to be nice, but I want to protect myself and not invite any advances \n\nI think if he wanted to just talk about professional things he could have offered that we eat lunch together some afternoon. Or he could have explicitly mentioned wanting to hear more about my work background over drinks. But he didn’t. Is he being friendly or weird? And I don’t know if he’s married, Randy doesn’t know either. \n\nPlease let me know if you get weird vibes from his messages. I may bring this to HR, but I don’t want to make a big deal out of something totally banal. I would love input from younger women who have been in similar situations and from men who have had their friendly gestures misinterpreted.",

        "text": "Quick and different take here, but something I have found from my life is that my social skills drastically improve every time I take a radical decision in my life. This happens for two main reasons:\n\n1)Radical Choices many times are associated with a big change of environment. As antisocial as you might be, a change of environment literally forces you to get out there and interact with new individuals. You are thrown into a new social sphere where you have no prior social backing, and this is almost like an experiment which enables you to put everything you thought you knew about interacting with people to practice\n\n2)Radical Change Builds Interesting Stories. Nothing brings people closer together than a story, and when you throw yourself into new experiences, especially ones that are so different that your brain considers them irrational. This makes you more interesting as a person, which in turn makes people gravitate towards you, building you up as a social individual.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, if you are unsatisfied with your ability to interact with people, or your life in general, taking a decision to jump into a new situation, so different its irrational to do so, can truly change your life for the better. It definitely has for me.\n\nIf you're interested, check out the video below for a better explanation of this concept:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bztwx8vhdQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Bztwx8vhdQ)",

        "text": "This is a sort-of follow up to one of my previous posts in this SR.\n\nCan I know what you'll make of this workplace situation, what you'll think of it, &amp; how to deal with it?\n\nLast Monday (30 Jan) my supervisor asked me to create a doc in OneDrive to make a list of all the issues that our team had been facing with this software (he asked me to do it cos I use that software the most so face the most issues - this is actually the software I'm trained in, it's what I bring to the team), &amp; he asked me to share this doc in Teams so everyone could add to it as needed. By Monday afternoon I had created the doc &amp; shared it with the team on Teams.\n\nThis Monday (6 Feb) he asked me to check for an update, so we could proceed to inform our vendor &amp; start resolving the issues. When I went to check on the doc, I noticed that this one girl from our team who I'll refer to as \"T\" had added a column \"category\" to the doc that I had created (I had created columns \"Sr, Issue, Requested by\").\n\nI've previously mentioned T in my old post [https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/ysh3f1/office\\_bullying\\_situation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/ysh3f1/office_bullying_situation/)\n\nWhat do you make of T creating this additional column in my doc?\n\nWhen I saw it, I immediately deleted it, &amp; created an additional column \"Notes\" where I added my notes to a couple of her issues saying that they had been previously resolved by me as part of an umbrella issue that I was facing in Jan &amp; that it works fine now (my note was not quite this long, was only 5-6 words, just have to explain it longer here cos I'm also trying not to give specifics).\n\nImo, T has a history of speaking up to show herself up even when she doesn't know things (this software is not something she knows well, actually has barely used it) &amp; making herself look good by making others look bad. Every office has one of these, &amp; T is the one at my office. But that's my opinion, I'd like your unbiased opinion.\n\nYesterday, my supervisor messaged me again that if the list is ready I should email it to the vendor &amp; start resolving things. &amp; right when he sent that message in Teams, T messaged me privately in Teams &amp; told me that she's deleted my \"Notes\" column because some of the issues haven't been resolved. I immediately removed her access from my doc &amp; re-added my \"Notes\" column. I also replied to her msg saying that I had used the software that day &amp; those particular issues haven't shown up &amp; those things work. Then after a while she replied back saying \"she had spoken to the vendor &amp; he said they had removed access for a little while because of security concerns, but they've re-added everything &amp; it all works now\". I've attached a screenshot of her msgs below.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/aayjw0T](https://imgur.com/a/aayjw0T)\n\nSince then, she hasn't asked me about her lost access to the doc.\n\nWhat do you'll make of this situation?",

I was fortunate to grow up in a household that valued this, with everyone sharing their thoughts and being cognizant to make space for (and prompt) others to share theirs as well, actively listening and reacting and keeping “hijacks” to a minimum.\n\nHowever, recently I’ve found myself with a couple of friends whose method of “conversing” seems to revolve almost entirely around sharing personal anecdotes, and listening only enough to pick up on something they can use as a springboard for them, often at the expense of whatever it was I was trying to convey. And tbh it drives me up the f’ing wall.\n\nI remember seeing a quote somewhere to the effect of “sometimes it’s best to listen and not relate” (and we all know the Pulp Fiction quote about listening vs waiting to speak) but short of just not hanging out with these people anymore, does anyone have any strategies for handling this type of person?",

        "text": "Hello! I am currently a college student. Recently, I've been feeling so tired and drained from school since our classes became face-to-face due to the pandemic. I've also been a really quiet person since elementary school, but not at home. It's like I have different personalities, lol, but now I'm a bit balanced! I am still scared when speaking out, probably due to puberty, in which I had a hard time finding my male voice and spoke in a high-tone falsetto all the time (it was traumatizing seeing them laugh every time I spoke before). I'm also not good at continuing conversations, like meeting people or joining classes, even though some are my classmates from the previous school. Lately, I think I'm a people-pleaser since I want to really make connections in this new school, but it's super hard. But I met two people who really made me feel normal in my own skin; they seem confident too, and I'm glad they look happy going with me sometimes. The other's, it feels like I can't make intimate relationships with them, and that's probably also me having trust issues, and that I'm also really slow in thinking of topics to talk about or understand theirs (I don't have a high IQ). Sometimes I just sit quietly while they are all laughing, and I also want to laugh, but I just can't enjoy it when I'm so drained from talking and analyzing their behavior if I say something wrong. Right now, I've completely given up and just talk when I want to. I want to conserve my energy while also talking to others, but sometimes I just automatically go into people-pleasing mode, which is tiring for me. I also don't have a good memory and my mind usually drifts off on a conversation like I just want to feel normal and communicate to them too but my brain just stops or maybe full of fear. I'm also really introverted and maybe a boring person due to me only making art all the time when I'm alone. I'm also really avoidant before but I'm trying.\n\n Please give me tips 🥺🥺🥺",

My direct supervisor also keeps telling me that I’m doing well (although, he teases me about how young I am, too).

Honestly He is the funniest and coolest person i have ever worked with and one of the best people ive ever been blessed to know. \n\nIm just confused because sometimes i would message him and invite him to things with out other coworkers and he wouldnt even text me back to say no which i thought was weird but hes kind of different so i truly didnt think much of it. We hung out only a couple times, and he just quit and has his last day and i really want him to be a part of my life but i cant tell if he feels the same way. He told me he considers me a good friend and that we would still see each other after but he quit a week ago and i just texted him a few hours ago saying i miss him and a picture of us on our last day and i asked if he was free tomorrow. He didn’t answer and the iMessage didn’t go through it just went straight to text so I’m kind of scared he blocked me? \nthere was a lot of sexual tension between us and he has a partner so i don’t know if that plays into it because he said i “test” him or whatever.\n\ni just have a really hard time making friends and i was so excited to just be his friend and im having a hard time cause i dont know what to think and im very confused. thanks to anyone who read i would really appreciate advice about it!",

Wouldn’t say hi to me, respond to me, have me dirty looks. Hated answering my questions and told me to ask someone else. \n\nI thought I was annoying her, so I left it alone for a while. Only until JUST NOW has she came around and realized I’m a cool person, and we’ve even been grabbing lunch together during our break. We recently had a heart to heart and she admitted to me she thought I was homophobic! She even told several coworkers of ours!\n\nSome agreed with her and thought I was, others apparently told her she was being hyper vigilant and crazy and shut her down. She thought I was homophobic because I was “quiet and stand offish”,  but after THREE MONTHS of hearing me make small talk with other coworkers and trying to assist her, did she realize she was wrong and I was a genuine, cool person. Definitely not a homophobic. \n\nThis really hurt me. I had other coworkers who are gay, and also not gay,that started ignoring me and avoiding me after she did and I could never place my finger on as to why they were. My first week went so well socially and after that I felt like the elephant in the room that everyone was gossiping about. Even had coworkers that came in after I did that would be invited out after work, and I was the only one left out.\n\nI cried. This hurt. This messed with me. I’m not a horrible person. I demanded she clear the air or else Im going to HR for bullying.\n\nThis isn’t the first time I’ve been judged for how people perceive me socially, or for being a bit awkward and introverted. I get so much outright hate and aggression for it and so many people think I’m a bitch without getting to know me.\n\nI’m tired of being told to be introspective and look at what I DID to make others hate me when it’s just so common to judge people without barely even speaking to them.",

I’m not being outright mean or insulting them but it’s more heavy sarcasm. It’s weird bc it’s only ppl that I meet in class and we sit together for a couple classes but with my closest friends, I’m never mean like that to them and they don’t think I’m a mean person (I asked them). Ex: my friend in class said today that the teachers BO was rlly bad and I didn’t know what to say so I said “I thought that was u”(????? Why would I say that ever, I honestly didn’t smell anything so I could’ve just said that)…. The other time was another friend saying that they feel old bc they went ice skating and fell off a scooter in one week and are rlly sore and I was being heavily sarcastic and saying “scootering AND ice skating? That’s too much” (I had like a disbelieving tone ig) and they said why are u being so mean. It rlly threw me off and now I’m thinking I’m a mean person. So how do I not do this or try to say different things? On text I’m not mean like this but I was thinking it’s proably bc I have time to think of other responses and choose the best one but I can’t do that face to face. So please help me be nicer",
