No one's arguing that.\n\nAs someone who is a scientist who studies languages, I am telling you, specifically, in linguistics, no one calls Okinawan a Japanese dialect. If you want to be \"specific\" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.\n\nIf you're saying \"Japanese language family\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of \"Japonic\", which includes things from Miyako-go to Yonaguni-go to Tokunoshima-go.\n\nSo your reasoning for calling Okinawan a Japanese dialect is because random Japanese right-wingers \"call Okinawans Japanese?\" Let's get Zainichi Koreans and Ainus in there, then, too.\n\nAlso, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. Okinawan is Okinawan and a member of the Japonic family. But that's not what you said. You said Okinawan is a Japanese dialect, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the Japonic family Japanese, which means you'd call all other Ryukyuan languages Japanese, too. Which you said you don't.\n\nIt's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?\n",

I hope you enjoy it!\n\n1. The differences between 'your' and 'you're' don't bother you much. After all, you only need to get your point across - it doesn't matter how well you do it.\n\n2. You feel the need to mention to someone when they add an extra comma into their sentences, and it's a little disappointing when you see a question without it's mark.\n\n3. If you see the wrong 'to,' 'too,' or 'two,' you've just gotta fix it. Browsing Facebook for horrible grammar to correct is calming.\n\n4. Seeing spelling, punctuation, or grammar mistakes constantly leaves your hope for the human race in shambles. Did these people even go to school?\n\n5. God, these comment-writers are idiotic! Why even post *anything* if no-one's going to know what they're saying? Learn to write!\n\n6. You don't fucking end a sentence with a preposition! Goddamn! What did the Oxford English Dictionary ever do to you to make you bury it in the backyard? \n\nHa! For the record, y'all, I'm a definite 6! Have a great weekend, everybody!",

I found some details behind the backstory [here](http://smritiweb.com/navin/miscellaneous/what-is-so-scientific-about-sanskrit-seriousquestion).  Mr. Briggs' article evidently made Indian nationalists cream their pants and a false rumor got started (that's still around) that NASA endorsed his ideas and were/are working on a secret project called \"Mission Sanskrit\".  \n\nAnyway, the article itself is gold, but coupled with its subsequent reaction is just extremely hilarious.  See the 'related questions' section at the bottom of [this page] on Quora(http://www.quora.com/Does-NASA-use-Sanskrit-as-part-of-the-work-it-does-in-the-field-of-AI) for an example of the rumors that spread.

This isn't a sub for posting pedantry.\n\n**2)  Posts or comments submitted for /r/badlinguistics should show a level of obstinateness for the comments or posts being submitted**\n\nIdeally, a case of badlinguistics should be about someone who is just rusted on to their badlinguistics, and is refusing to change their opinion in the face of all other evidence. Preferably this will be on the side of pure bloody-mindedness about the badlinguistics than just the usual refusal of people to listen to anyone else on the internet.\n\nNo-one cares if someone is using a word strangely, or if their pronunciation of something is different. Submissions must have a sufficient level of content, or they will be subject to possible removal.\n\nThis post may be further appended with guidelines by mods, so if you see distinguished comments, listen to them. The sidebar will be updated with these rules and a link to this thread.\n\nEdit:\n\n/u/millionsofcats adds [a good point](http://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/2vciky/dont_post_contentlight_submissions/cogfdlp):\n&gt;Addendum:\n\n&gt;Stuff like Cameroonians Speak Tamil is still fine--more than fine, actually, it's great. It's not an argument where someone's being pigheaded but the level of dedication and wrongness raises it way above thin content. You know that guy's not listening to what anyone has to say about the subject.\n\n&gt;This post was written to address links to stuff on reddit. We're not here to shred people who are a little confused or make a single mistake",
