I’ve sent her numerous emails as well and talked with her in class but she has still not changed it. I let her know that she would receive a failing grade if it is not changed. I even wrote out detailed instructions on how to do it because she claimed she didn’t know where to go and was unable to use my instructions. On Friday I told her to call the office of undergrad studies and she stated she would. \n\nOur add/drop ended on Friday and my department chair emailed me this am saying she did not change it.\n\nI am not sure what is going on or if I should be communicating differently with her.

The cities are spread out and I can't even get basic groceries. I've been spending most of my stipend on Uber/Lyft. Also, I had gotten really used to driving for years before moving here. I see no way out of getting a car here.  \n\n\nSo I wanted to see if there are fellow international students in the US in grad school who have bought cars, and how did they go about it? Did you buy new or used? Where did you buy from? What financing options did you use, and what do you recommend? I can't put down full price for the car, I need to look for options that allow for EMIs. Also, any particular type of cars you recommend? I don't have a credit score yet but I think that should be coming soon. Any tips would be helpful, I am pretty clueless about this here!",

I already notice that when the coursework component now is over and we are all scattered around writing our individual dissertations, I miss the added value of discussing the theories and concepts with peers. (I’m in a blended learning program, where we had intensive lectures for the coursework, and met up from across the country - now all I have is meetings with my supervisor and other than that I’m alone. I stay in touch with my group, but it’s mainly to encourage each other. We write on quite different topics.)\n\nIt will be sad when it’s all over and I lose touch with academia. I also need to take time to prioritise the professional development related to my job, which has been on the back burner the last few years.\n\nFor those of you who may have graduated and returned to full time professional work - do you still read like you used to do in grad school?

I almost think you're better off manually doing citations than using Mendeley these days. I've just started a Phd and it's in a different topic than before, so I can start off with all new folders and documents and don't need to migrate my old folder system from Mendeley. Its an ideal time to move away for me.  \n\n\nLooking at switching to either Zotero or Endnote, and want suggestions on which one to go for. My PI uses Endnote, but I would have to pay for it. Still, I would consider a one-time payment for it if it's worth the investment and offer significant advantages over Zotero. Please let me know what you think.",

The personal statement prompt asks about my professional goals and how getting a scholarship would help me achieve those goals. I'm hesitant to mention my ADHD in my personal statement, but if I did mention it I could go for a few different angles:\n\n1. I've proven myself by getting a bachelor's unmedicated and now I'm medicated\n2. It's hard for me to do grad school full time and work because of my ADHD so getting money would be very helpful\n3. I can better advocate for students with ADHD and related issues",

I am feeling uncertain and know changing would cause some upheaval, but if I were to do it now is the time while I am still funded by my program and not PI. The lab I joined I feel will not give me the exposure to all the techniques and skills I would want to learn to make myself competitive for industry but the PI is great and laid back.",

        "text": "Hi folks, I'm an undergrad so I hope this is allowed here :)\n\nI'm currently finishing my bachelor thesis and my advisor wants to make a paper out of some my results with me as first author (yay!).\nMy topic is semi-active suspension and in my thesis I have done both modelling and simulations (analytical and multi-body) as well as the design of a prototype system. \nThe point of the simulations was to see if the overall concept works while the prototype is an implementation of the concept.\nMy advisor wants me to put both the simulations as well as the hardware prototype into the one paper and use the latter to validate the former (in a rather complicated experimental setup).\n\nHowever I'm increasingly sceptical of this approach:\n- My prototype lacks some capabilities required by the concept due to me being restricted to certain components and slight design issues. This might mean that while the concept itself works I will be unable to prove it experimentally with the hardware I have.\n- My prototype is only part of the system that the concept requires. My experimental setup would be quite different from what I'm actually proposing as a solution which to me makes it sketchy to use the experiment as validation of my proposed solution.\n\nSo I'm thinking that instead of cramming everything into one paper I might make two more detailed ones. The first one would be the theoretical view with the ideal concept, validated by various simulations as well as an exploration of the boundary conditions  (plus some more related stuff I have done).\n\nThe second one would then be just the hardware prototype and its testing and comparison to the state of the art. Both the basic concept and implementation are entirely novel so I think this might (?) be worthy of publication on it's own.\n\nHow large must the scope of a paper be to not be 'too thin'? Does this depend on the importance of the findings or the journal/conference?\nIs it critical that I support my work with physical experiments or can well-made simulations be good enough?\n\nThanks for any advice!",

I should graduate with a 3.8+ GPA, a little undergrad research assistant experience, a manufacturing internship involved in both the aviation and space sectors, and an internship at a space company working on rocket engines. I also help run an extracurricular competitive design team at my school. I feel like I would be a strong candidate if I apply, but I’m not sure how the industry and extracurricular experience is weighed in applications. My research experience was pretty short, but I loved it!\n\nWithin aerospace, I’m most interested in metallurgy and specialty materials and their behavior in extreme conditions, especially propulsion applications. I want to be working on rocket or jet engines in some capacity. \n\nIt’s been hard for me to tell if my interests require a graduate degree. I see a lot of varying advice online. I’ve been considering doing either a masters or PhD in mechanical engineering, materials science, or aerospace engineering. The commitment level of a PhD scares me a little, but being funded and having that level of education sounds nice. \n\nThe reasons I want to go to grad school are that I want a job that will allow me to significantly contribute to the field, and I loved the bit of undergrad research experience I had. I dismissed grad school for awhile because while I love to learn, the amount of classes in undergrad is super stressful, but if I have a project that interests me I’ll happily work on it for hours on end. Now that I have a better idea of what grad school is about, I think it might be more up my alley. I also want to meet people who are enthusiastic about the field. \n\nI’m not sure if the BS is enough to do what I want, or if a masters or PhD is what I should be aiming for. I’m a first gen student and am still researching, so I would appreciate any advice I can get. I will also ask people I know from my internships and professors I have a good relationship with these questions, I just decided to post here to potentially find some new perspectives.",
