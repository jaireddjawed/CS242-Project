        "text": "\"Apocalapyse Now\" is fantastic for example. The way our characters go deep in the jungle, almost as if they were getting lost. There's this feeling of confusion at every turn, as they get wrapped in all the war and madness. It's surrealist at certain point. And the mise en scène helps too: there is so many stuff going on that's just out of our character's control. \n\nI also think of Jacques Demy's films and the way he builds worlds. \"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\", as far as I've seen, is the best movie to create a world which feels balanced with it's fantasy/magic, while keeping a real sense to it. You as a viewer, just get absorbed in it, and after the first 10 minutes you actually start to buy it and get sucked into the singing and the colors, and the tragic, realistic story.. Same goes for \"Donkey Skin\" for example. \n\nIn \"Before Sunrise\", the world feels alive. Our protagonists interact with their enviorment, they meet people, people meet them, etc. They just get lost in the city and in their conversations. \n\nIn \"Rear Window\", the buildings around our protagonist, althought small, are a world itself. \n\nYou could also say all this stuff about Blade Runner, Taxi Driver, Barry Lyndon, even the Sicily sequence in The Godfather Part I. \n\nDo you have some recommendations? What do you think about these kind of movies?",

        "text": "This is a bit of a broad question but basically, what film feels more like it kinda captures your personality, life experiences, feelings, beliefs and tastes. I'll try using two examples that relate to myself in different ways.\n\nMy second favorite of all time, Shiki-Jitsu (or Ritual), for me, best captures how I have felt in my own life and how I still feel now. It's a story about 2 people wondering aimlessly in a seemingly abandoned train railroads and an abandoned buildings with outside personal problems conflicting with their time outside of it. These characters cope on each other and it is what keeps them sane and yet, less sane at the same time. To me, it just perfectly captures this escapism from things I cannot help but get extremely anxious about and trying to hide from it all in my own mind but then thoughts about those outside forces come through and interrupt me from whatever I was doing to hide from them. And just like the director and the young woman, I have that one only person in my life I have ever felt that truly close to but haven't felt that much company even with them but just more desperate to depend on them to keep me on their side. This disillusionment, codependency, loneliness and depression are feelings that are so prevalent in this film as it is with a lot of how I feel it myself. I think Hideaki Anno does an incredible job at just showing like the most broken parts inside ourselves and even though they seem to very clearly about his own negative feelings and thoughts, it does feel for me to be rather universal and true. It's a beautiful film about the unbeauty of our minds in the worst times and in the more mundane times.\n\nStory Of Ricky captures this taste of mine and also partially my own political beliefs. It's a story of a big strong altruistic motherfucker who beats the guts out of big strong bad motherfuckers to resist a private prison that horribly mistreats and murders its prisoners. I always found this kind of appeal in the idea of this ideal figure who is trying his best to challenge and overcome a system that is so much bigger than themselves and protecting those who are oppressed by others like Kenshiro (Fist Of The North Star), Dr. Kenzo Tenma (Monster, Kaji (The Human Condition Trilogy) and Samurai Jack. As a leftist, I do believe that societal problems cannot be solved by just a few individuals or great men and requires more of a collective but I still find these kinds of characters very appealing and they can represent the kind of ideals that we should collectively strive to fight for to liberate ourselves and each other from the systems established on us. And also, I just fucking love seeing cartoonish violence. So much fun and it releases the child inside of me.",

The mansion sequence is one of the most mesmerizing scenes in film history as our protagonist learns there are different tiers of wealth; our rich, handsome doctor protagonist is nothing but an ant compared to the truly wealthy.

It's a film that on the surface, is about 2 neighbors just living their own private lives and getting to know each other in such a way that they form a special bond but it is also about how the fact that living in a fascist country affects which kind of behaviors you will participate and how it can matter and have grave consequences on your own neighbors even if you don't feel personally affected in the same way.  And also, how otherwise horrible ideologies can become so normal in a society that we do not question them and treat it as just a natural aspect of living your personal life. In this case, that being a woman means you have less rights than a man and that you must be a housewife with children while thinking that homosexuality is immoral. It's a pretty relevant story still to this day with a message broader than just the takeover of Hitler and Mussolini but how we should care about outside societal issues and how we cannot just separate from our own lives.",

        "text": "“Go to Sleep.”\n\nSkinamarink is a micro-budget horror film made by Canadian filmmaker Kyle Edward Ball. The film is a chamber piece, taking place entirely inside of an ordinary house which is suddenly missing doors and windows. The film contains almost no dialogue nor nearly any effects. There is a digital, cheap-looking grain effect superimposed on the entire film, mimicking a 70s era camera. \n\nMost of the film is quiet, except for a television displaying black and white cartoons in the public domain, and the shrill sounds of Legos being dumped and moved about. Skinamarink was made for under $25,000, has a barebones plot, only five total characters, and a wafer-thin story which must be researched online to truly grasp. It is also the scariest film I have ever seen and has tortured me psychologically for well over a month.\n\nThe film follows two children, Kevin and Kaylee, who awake one night to discover their father has vanished, along with every door and window in their house. During the course of the night – which may or may not actually be an eternity – the pair begin to sense the presence of a nameless, shapeless entity who exists only to watch them suffer.\n\nSkinamarink is fundamentally divisive. The online discourse surrounding the film is split neatly into ratings of 1s and 10s; the 1s have a slight majority but both sides are each passionate about their opinions of the film and utterly confused and/or dismayed by those who think differently. The discourse – all of the love, hatred, confusion, and polarity – make sense considering the technique and circumstances of Skinarmarink’s creation.\n\nAgain, the film is essentially plotless, basically requires external material for deeper readings, and is, in every sense, *extremely* minimal. Its pacing is glacial and its chamber drama construction bears no opportunity for variety of place, time, or dynamic narrative structure. Therefore, those not in tune with its superior sense of atmosphere, those who simply aren’t instilled with the sense of dread the film is capable of conjuring, will have *nothing* to grab hold to at almost any point. \n\nDiscussing, analyzing, and hypothesizing on *why* some don’t buy into the film’s power is interesting, and will be explored later, but both sides must understand a fundamental truth: the feelings of either dread or boredom the film creates at any one moment will be replicated in all remaining moments. In other words, Skinamarink is a cinematic monolith; what you see when you first gaze in is all there is. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nIf the film doesn’t work for you, it doesn’t work for you…however, if you are in tune with Skinarmarink’s unique sense of primordial darkness, prepare for a viewing experience of psychological unease and childlike helplessness. Allow me to indulge in removing my critical objectivity and third-person presentation to describe my incredible fright.\n\nFilms often have no effect on me. This is true of every genre but it’s particularly true of horror, which I often find boring, uncreative, and repetitive, despite my love for the potential of the genre to challenge and excite. Before Skinamarink, the only film to make me hold onto my fear after the credits was Hereditary, which took only an extra day or two to process and recover from. \n\nIt has now been one month since I saw Skinamarink on the big screen; when darkness falls and the house grows silent, when I prepare for sleep or am simply trying to quietly reflect, I am still burdened and unsettled by the feelings I experienced while watching the film. The agony started in the theater, as I buried my head into my hands, barely peeking through to see nothing but static on slivers of the screen. I missed about half of the movie in this state, debating with myself on whether to stay or leave, frequently wanting to walk out but too frightened to move. \n\nThe type, intensity, and presence of fear I felt in the theater was that of when I was just a scared little boy, shaking and quivering through trailers for films my prepubescent mind found thoroughly unpleasant. That feeling has lessened in the last month but has not entirely dissipated. Skinamarink, to my nonfictional, entirely real horror, has reignited a fear of the dark I had long since forgotten, and has left me in the trembling, contemplative state of my youth. Uniquely personal visions of horror have started to intrude, and my psyche is desperate to close a box which has long been sealed, but which this damned film has reopened.\n\nIf I could sum up my thoughts on the film in five words, before slipping back on my veil of objectivity: Skinamarink is way too effective. \n\nPerhaps the most interesting element of the film is the audience split, the love and hate. Why are some so entranced and affected when others are bored to tears? The first and most simple theory is setting of viewership. The film was leaked after a festival (intentionally, some speculate) leading to rampant piracy. Those who watch Skinarmarink on a laptop, with headphones in, are unequivocally missing the full experience. Most notably, the imagined figures in the dark static and immaculate sound design could both be misconstrued on a smaller screen. If one even hopes to find the fear in the film, a theater is mandatory.\n\nAlternatively, Skinamarink may frighten those who have personally lived through its setting and emulations. More than just a feeling or question of nostalgia, Skinarmarink’s fear is a child’s fear, a fear of the unknown, an ambiguous fear most likely felt by acolytes in their own lives, when they were children. I theorize that the tone, implications, and psychological impact of the film is most deeply felt in those able to directly visualize themselves within the film, next to Kevin and Kaylee, scared and alone in a dark house with nothing but a television and a set of Legos to distract from the horrors of the house and the world. \n\nViewers who stayed up late at night against their parents’ wishes, who had no company but blurry media and some simple toys in a slumbering house, maybe those who were generally anxious or unnerved throughout their childhood, even those with more extreme or rare trauma, will most intensely respond to Skinamarink. To sit through the movie is to sit through those memories, and the fears they create, again.\n\nThe film’s emulation of the period is not just neutrally presented, but shockingly precise and accurate. Every element is meticulously tuned for maximum fear and discomfort: there’s little sound throughout (the stark sound of rustling, crashing Legos most frequently keeps me awake at night) there is no adult presence to comfort characters or the audience, there is no logical rhyme or rhythm to the editing – causing shots to linger agonizingly long on ambiguous minutia – there is no human presence outside the house, there is little light from within, and there is no explanation or exposition as to the why or how of it all. The viewer is utterly alone with the children throughout, hoping for relief, praying for release.\n\nSkinamarink can be summarized, ironically enough, with a quote from beloved comedy The Office. As the group watches a film made by Gabe, he senses confusion and tension about the lack of story, and chimes in: “Yeah, seems like there isn’t a narrative. Maybe the filmmaker realized that even narrative is comforting.” Most know, in some sense, that narrative is indeed comforting. But I never knew just how comforting it was until it was gone.\n\n10/10",

        "text": "TL;DR -- This is long. :-)   \n\n\nHave you ever experienced an artwork that grips you viscerally, sensually, inexplicably? It’s like a painter has seen through your eyes, or a musician holds a key to your soul, and the rhythms and tones open your heart and you simply do not know why?\n\nThat is one kind of art. ‘Blockbuster” art, if we are to analogize to movies. \n\nVan Gogh’s “Starry Night” is like the art equivalent of “Avatar. The color, the three-dimensional thickness of painted ridges, the flow of turbulence, mental and cosmic. Flashy, accessible, wildly popular, easily franchised and prone to sequels or imitation. \n\nAnd yet, it is important to remember, not everyone liked “AvaTár” and not everyone gigs on STárry Night, so find the example that fits you best, in your memory, before we move on to another type of art – Perhaps we’ll call it, being the uncultured plebes we are, “WTF” art? \n\nIt’s the type of art a person can stand before and say things like, “I don’t know WHAT the fuck this guy was going for,” or as I’ve heard said while viewing a Rothko, “That’s not art. I could do that.” This type of art’s mysteries are not immediately available. \n\nThe power of a given piece – nay, it’s very reason for inclusion in a museum’s collection – may require some backstory, context, or knowledge of when and why it as created. Ability to speak another language may help, and have insight to idiom and literary or cultural references of the time in that language add to a piece’s power. What is the piece reacting to? What societal influences shaped it coming into existence? What aspect of the artist’s personal experience or expression is manifest? \n\nThe “Dada” movement is a prime example, with artists producing absurdity in response to the absurd brutality of World War I. But then, every new “school” of art, filled with artists trying to find fame that separates them from the art and artists that came before them, is like this. Even STárry Night has great backstory. \n\nIt is not mine to suggest one kind of art is better than another, more deserving of fame, or more meaningful. We like what we like. “The heart wants what it wants. “\n\n== == = == === == = == = == = = =\n\nBut I am here to tell you that, if you don’t already know it, “Tár,” Todd Field’s latest directorial effort, featuring the astounding performance of lead actor Cate Blanchett as Lydia Tár, is among the most sublime of that second type of art. \n\nAnd while it’s OK if it’s just not your cup of tea, and you’d prefer to see a Rom-Com, or ‘Star Wars XIV, Menacing of The Jawa,” you should at LEAST walk away from Tár knowing what you are abandoning.\n\n== == = = == = = = == = = === = = \n\n**Separating Art From Artist**\n\nThe question runs through the entire story of “Tár” and within all of its multiple quick-hit Name Drops on real-world exemplars of musical geniuses, past and present, entangled with their complicated private lives, and abuse of power. Can we – SHOULD we – separate the artist from their art?\n\nTell me: The first time you were taken by that piece of art that gutted you, your \"Starry Night\" -- did you separate the artist from the art? You had to, because in a truly epiphanic moment like that, you don’t even know who the artist is. You only know the art, as you experience it! \n\nYou are smitten, and the experience is as much of the artist as it is a projection of your own experience, dreams, pains and desires.  YOU create the art in your mind. \n\nWhat do you do when, after researching, you find your auteur is not up to your moral standards? Forget that he or she or they spoke words, drew images, or sang lyrics that saved your life? Do you deny that you ever saw yourself in that work?\n\nThe question, this central theme, like Bach’s music (as Lydia Tár demonstrates in one of the early, controversial scenes) is never answered, but left wide open for you to deal with, one of many powerful themes held firmly upright between the bookends of the films first and last words. \n\n**Just Do Art!** \n\nThe bookends, keeping all other themes standing: \n\nIn darkness, before anything, we hear Lydia Tár coaxing some artist, “Just ignore the microphone. Sing as if it’s not there.” A high-pitched, dissonant, non-Western voice begins. Some interpret this as being a recording of the ethnographic field studies of Tár’s years in Peru studying the “Shipibo-Kenibo” people’s songs and religion. But it could just as easily be the indigenous song of an Asian singer, gathered in her work at the end of the film, two hours and thirty-eight minutes later, as Tár conducts a small orchestra in front of an audience of cos-players, attending a video game conference, somewhere in the Philippines. \n\nAt the end, we hear a narrated voiceover from the video game, “Monster Hunter”, a ship captain’s speech, steeling his recruits for the horrors they will face if they join his crew to hunt monsters. “Once you step aboard this ship, there is no turning back. And those who choose may step aside. You will not be judged.” \n\nThe first bookend: Just make art, regardless of opinion, criticism, or attack. \n\nTár makes art, caring not a whit for her circumstance, or the opinions of the audience, because that is what drives her, beyond all else. She knows the bargain she made, summed up by the final words of the movie.\n\nThe second bookend: If you dare to ascend to this stage, you WILL be judged, perhaps even attacked. You will hunt monsters, and in the process perhaps even become one.  But if you choose the meek, silent, inoffensive route – the neutral, non-participant -- you will not be judged. \n\nIt sounds like a blessing, but it is a curse. \n\nYou will not be judged, but neither will you be remembered or paid attention to. For either your art, or for yourself -- the artist. You will experience the only thing worse than being judged. You will be nothing.\n\nThe messages about ignoring opinion arise over and over again, for example in discussing one of Tár’s predecessors in the Berlin Philharmonic’s role of Principal Conductor, Karajan. This is where Tár, the movie, is like the Rothko, or DADA. One would have to know that Karajan conducted during the Nazi era, and one of his prime philosophies was to completely ignore the opinions of the audience. The “true artist” always will. \n\nYet his attitude is discussed in the context of worldwide pressure for reputable people to withdraw from supporting the Nazi movement in any way. Karajan’s fame, his critics argued, was lending credence to the Nazis. He made great art, but his support of Hitler tarnished his reputation. \n\nTo the contrary, another conductor name dropped, Furtwaengler, went out of his way to criticize Hitler and offer resistance, but after the war – when the “monster hunters” arrived (Andris even SAYS \"monster hunters,\" foreshadowing the ending) the performers of “denazification” – Furtwangler’s career was destroyed even though he had resisted Hitler, because those hunting Nazis were not making fine distinctions. \n\nIt was, and is, a no win situation to be judged from outside your time, or outside any sphere of your control.  But one must still make art. \n\n**Politics, The Victim and the Perpetrator**\n\nAmid all of this advocacy that one pay no attention to the audience or critics, is a cross-current of Tár and all around them paying extraordinary attention to the politics of gaining and preserving power. Doing what they have to do to get where they want to be, and/or preserving what they have achieved. Kowtowing to donors, and meisters, and peers in a higher slot in the hierarchy of the orchestra. You MUST play the game, because the game exists. \n\nEveryone who wants to move up is playing political chances. Everyone who wants to hold power is playing other angles, to stay where they are. Everyone involved is both victim and perpetrator at different times and to different degrees.  The only failure is to not play the game. \n\nThe subtle implication (planted by a mysterious, live video-text stream, recurring through the movie) is that someone is trying to take Lydia Tár down, along with her partner (in life and in crime), her wife Sharon. We learn Sharon helped the young, hungry, aspiring Tár navigate the politics of the Philharmonic to oust her immediate predecessor Andris, and his gay lover Sebastian. In exchange for what? Lydia’s promise of love and marriage? Sharon wanted to rise, and could only do so by allying with Tár. She made the choice, and she will pay the price. \n\nTár’s political choices, to rise to her role, included continuing to fund free limousine transport for Andris after he is ousted, and allowing Sebastian to stay employed, in exchange for her not outing Andris as gay.  Tár and Sharon knew which cards to play to get what they wanted.\n\nWe see a similar parallel in the story of Alma -- Mahler’s wife, the dedicatee of his 5th symphony – who wanted to write music, but was held back by the jealous Mahler. Promise broken, she leaves Mahler and marries Gropius, who goes on to greater fame and gives her freedom to write. The jilted, crushed Mahler, writes his magnum opus and dedicates it to the one who caused him pain. \n\nI sense that Lydia will one day dedicate a symphony to Olga.\n\nWhich brings us back to that video stream. Olga (the new rising star; the new target of Tár’s serial abuse) is colluding with Tár’s most recent conquest, Francesca, the misused faithful servant with hopes of rising on Tar’s coattails (as Alma did Mahler’s). But Francesca has just discovered that Tar would rather drive a challenger to suicide than allow her own career to be upstaged by a protégé. \n\nAnd so it came to pass, that Francesca and Olga, begat by Tár and Sharon, begat by Andris and Sebastian, begat lo these many generations prior by Alma and Mahler, continue a cycle in which it is impossible to discern who is victim and who is perpetrator, in this vain attempt to ascend to godhood, by any means necessary.\n\n**Intent: Eyes on me!**\n\nWe find out toward the end of the movie that Lydia Tár is really the re-invented, working-class Linda Tarr. She exhorts all of her pupils to discover the intent of the artist. Any “robot” can play the notes, but the conductor must discern intent, and infuse it into the performance. \n\nDiscovering the intent of a dead composer is like discerning “God’s Will,” so in that way Lydia Tár is aspiring to Godhood as a conductor. And she is a jealous god. Showering good will on those who obey. Smiting those who defy. Demanding, over and over, “Eyes on me! Give me some eyes!”\n\nAnd how does one discern intent? Deep study. Meditation. Kabbalah-esque deciphering of anagrams? Ayahuasca retreats with Krista Taylor (the suicidal protégé, haunting Tár throughout). Tar attempts to discern Krista’s intent by scrambling the letters in her name. Krista becomes “AT RISK??” A possible reading. \n\nWhen writing a review of a movie about an egotistical, narcissistic maniac willing to do ANYTHING (including changing her name) to get eyes on her, is it a stretch to conjure a connection between the name of an indigenous tribe (“Shipibo-Kenibo”) and Evel Knievel, an egotistical, narcissistic maniac willing to change his name and break every bone in his body to get eyes on him? Is it just coincidence that my voice-to-text dictation converts “egotistical” to “ego, testicle?” \n\nWhat was Lydia’s intent? To get eyes on her. To be famous, and stop at nothing to get there. Even inciting suicide in one who threatens her. But they are all ACTING to get what they want. Opinion be damned, societal strictures be gone. Desire is king. \n\n“Tár” (the movie) asks us, is it possible to ascend to godhood, without committing some devilish atrocities? It is about living one’s life as an artist. The artist is to sing, and dance – Conduct the Berlin Philharmonic? -- as if no one is watching. Act, without regard -- to the outcome, to the dangers to yourself, or for the opinions of others. \n\nTár is the story of every person who ever wanted to be “The Decider,” a’la George W. Bush; wants to be the one who names reality, and says what “is;” wants to be the one who discerns the “intent” of dead forefathers; wants to be the one remembered for what they have done, by the output of their daily, and lifelong devotion to perfecting their art. \n\nWhat is to be divined by looking at the curious case of Krista Tayler (please, allow me to rename her, as Linda Tarr allowed herself to become Lydia Tár)? \n\nKrista Tayler = STARK REALITY. Lydia Tár = DAILY ART. And never the twain shall separate, art and artist. Deal with that stark reality, as you create your daily art, aspiring to godhood.\n\n“Tár” (the movie) relentlessly refuses to be “Blockbuster” art, but it is phenomenally rich art for those willing to make the investment. It demands knowledge, experience, awareness, interpretation, thought, practice, discipline. \n\nAnd it doesn’t care what you think of it.",

After much discussion with co-screenwriter Tony Kushner they still didn't get anywhere.\n\nThe Fabelmans has been both praised and criticized as a lavish love letter to cinema, a movie magic fable, etc. I personally disagree. It is all of these things, and it does them rather well, but this is all surface level, it doesn't get to the black heart at the center of it.\n\nSpielberg has spoken about his shame about being Jewish during his youth. The outsider, the only Jewish kid in the neighborhood, bullied. He yearned to be all-American, like the cowboys he saw in the pictures. When he sees his bully, practically the Aryan ideal, he instintinctly knows he's watching the hero of the movie. He's projecting his own subconscious desires onto the screen, and the bully can't handle it, because he's watching himself and yet he isn't watching himself, he's been turned into an object and it's horrifying.\n\nThis is a constant theme. In the war picture of course he's also projecting guilt about his parents divorce. In the camping flick he reveals what he always knew deep down about his mother and uncle Benny but could never face, same as the whole family.

However, I feel like I've hit some insurmountable hurdle at this point. I've never taken a film class and I don't ever plan to, and I feel like this has shallowed my understanding of moviemaking as a medium.\n\nMy primary frustration is related to the fact that I am unable to express *why* I like a movie in some cases. When I watch films like \"The Night of the Hunter\" or \"Blade Runner\", my reason for liking it is limited to \"it looked cool\". I feel limited in that I can only adequately evaluate films on the basis of things like plot, characters, and visuals to a limited extent. When watching films by people like Hitchcock who was noted for his ability to create suspense - how can I recognize his ingenuity when my knowledge on the matter is limited to \"low camera angles indicates power\"? It's these gaps that fueled my wish to understand more about filmmaking.\n\nSo my question here is, where do I start? What resources would help me fill the gaps and allow me to appreciate and express my appreciation for some movies? Are there any specific tips that would help me? Thanks in advance.",

        "text": "All three of these films are about making films.  They're also all set in Southern California, and they're all long movies that place the viewer directly in a place and time.  The late seventies to early eighties, the late sixties, and the Roaring Twenties.\n\nI'd say the first two are more accomplished than the latter, but I do like this sort of movie, I'm finding.  I'm wondering if anyone here could point me in the direction of-\n\nMovies about making movies, or the movie industry in general.\n\nMovies about a specific era, or place.  I love to travel, and certain movies can really make you feel like you're actually \"there.\"  Not just \"hey, Dirty Harry was set in 1970s San Francisco so there ya go,\" but kind of \"this is how people lived.  This is what they were listening to, what they were wearing, what they cared about, what it looked like.\"  It's almost like watching a good, informal history book.\n\nI'm open to everything.  For instance, if there's a good movie about how the Japanese movie industry works, I'd love it.  French, Hong Kong, Italian, etc.  Furthermore, I'd love movies about certain periods as well.  I'm looking forward to the Kino Lorber release of Millennium Mambo, as it's about the life of a young woman in Taipei (I hear, haven't watched it yet).  And I love Wong Kar-Wai's movies set in then-present day 1990s Hong Kong.",

While I've always been aware that people made movies, that they didn't just appear out of nowhere, this was probably the first time that I've ever actually been aware of a film's director, as I immediately knew that I needed to watch everything John Waters had made.\n\nIt, along with most of Waters' filmography, have always been rather divisive: some calling it pure trash, while others saw the gleefulness in them, a celebration of counter cultures and the \"abnormal\", and a middle finger to the polite society Waters grew up in. I've always sided with the latter group, and seeing Pink Flamingos tie for spot 211 has made me so happy. I take it as a sign that maybe the abnormal is slowly becoming normal, and that we as a society are becoming more acceptable, and some of us may not be taking ourselves too seriously anymore.",

        "text": "The moment when the rhythm and the beauty of this masterpiece hit me, I said, \"Thank God the Irish for bringing us these forgotten tales from a land far from our region &amp; imagination.\" Inisherin is an Island isolated in senses more than one. It's inhabitants rather unique to us. The way of talking and mannerisms are unique as well as peculiar. Yet, they seem very much in tune with our imagination of what people from a place like this should talk like. \n\nThe film opens into one of the most beautiful sceneries I've had to encounter played into by one of the most enchanting scores I've had to encounter. Very rarely do we get to encounter films where the score by itself is set apart great in its own right. The last composer I had similar (yet not same) experience was with Zbigniew Preisner. \n\nDespite the grayer shades developing into an astute darkness later on in the film, the setting of it combined with the dialogues and acting presents a rather sweet &amp; lovely atmosphere. It is rather comforting in the same manner as the beginning of The Hobbit (book). I think it does remain a fact that the plot by its very brimming excellence opens up interpretations of human ego, existentialism, and the concept of goodness. This should not deter us from viewing the very film as a story in manner of folk tales with the right tinges of magical realism or absurdism. We have the fool (Dominic), the bully (Kearney), the good simple fella (Pádraic), the good virtuous lady (Siobhán), and the man in crisis (ColmSonnyLarry). The tale has interpretations that may reach to modern minds as adaptation of their new age beliefs, yet at the same time, it is preserving the old lost storytellings amongst simpler people in simpler times. \n\nThe Island to me strikes completely different. Except Dominic, most people seem well dressed. The civility in the Bar is shocking to me. As it is with all good things, they remain on a surface which covers the most broken and unmet desires of a being. The contest of ideas between the two old pals (fools) regarding everlasting legacy and continuous moments of kindness may put forth some reflection. It is however also a display of insufficiencies carried by both of them. The crisis of artistic immortality is a torturous path upon a man drowned in anxiety of his own mortality. So is the kindness of the good man whose own goodness is self-absorbed and in the very moment of grief, he finds himself turning ill willed and flinging himself into opting bad means to have that sense of goodness in his life. \n\nIn some sense, we are all tortured souls, bearing anxiety of our limitations. Even the best of us, to me, it is Siobhán, suffer. She may be the most tortured of them all. She balances herself as a bridge between two enemies, very possibly had lost the person whom she was to marry, remains engrossed in the books on a land where men and the books remain somewhat distant, not by antagonism, but by incapability or indifference. \n\nIt is by far one of the most beautiful films I have seen. I truly loved it. \n\nThe performances set the bar average much higher. I think Colin Farrell has been praised everywhere very highly. I had personally found the performances of Kerry Condon &amp; Barry Keoghan truly exceptional. More than for directing, I think Martin McDonagh deserves the higher praise for his screenplay. \n\nIn all, this is a remarkable film. Hopefully, one that would be remembered for a while.",

        "text": "The feeling I immediately got at the first scene of this film, was one of having to fight to stay afloat. The first line is a rattling off of achievements related to classical music, most of which I had no idea what they were, and what followed was an extended dialogue scene of name-dropping and esoteric references. It was very similar to hearing a conversation in a language you only have a passing grasp of, and so having to hang on every word to piece together a context. I thus felt placed, not only in a place of inferiority, but also in awe of someone whose grasp of “the language” was so firm and elegant. To hear Lydia Tár converse with such erudition on a topic I had no clue about was mesmerizing. I was struck by her genius.\n\nThat’s the film, right there, encapsulated in those first ten or so minutes. Lydia’s world is among the most esoteric, and in that world she is queen. The inclination to deference before someone like her is one so many of us share. And so when someone like that looks at you, gives you attention, wants you, it’s as if the sun itself smiles at you. Doubly so if you are trying to get ahead yourself in that same world. She is but one in a long line of people who know the power they have, and are more than willing to use it. But who is that person really? Behind all the prestige and accolades, what’s really there? In the case of Lydia Tár, nothing much at all. \n\nLydia conducts her entire world according to a precise rhythm that has no room for error, and most people are more than willing to follow her. Nearly every one of her relationships is based around that power-imbalance and transactionality. Even the spaces in which she moves seem to run on a sort of rhythmic loop between two spartan apartments, the same sterile rehearsal space, the same jogging route, the same dining halls. But when little by little, elements start to creep in that don’t follow that rhythm, it sets off the complete unravelling of this orchestral piece that is Lydia’s life. The beat is thrown off. Those spaces, all crisp, clean, and measured, begin to peel and crack. The invasion of random, irregular noises (an elevator, the electric thrumming of a freezer, sudden screams that come from nowhere at all), paired with nightmares, threatening emails and the appearance of an incoherent neighbor, all build into a cacophony of chaos that not even the most skilled conductor could bring together in harmony.\n\nThe resistance of the real world to Lydia’s attempts at orchestrating it is embodied in two very different characters. First we have Olga, the young, attractive, punk-rock violinist. Lydia is immediately taken with her, and goes about “acquiring” her in the only way she knows how. She bribes Olga, she flirts and entices, she dangles opportunities. But Olga just won’t comply. What is made clear from the first interaction between the two (through classical music jargon that I only half understood) was that this girl doesn’t fit any of Lydia’s expectations, and that there simply is no way of controlling her. This challenge to her power is what sets Lydia on the path of destruction. So if Olga is the beginning, the Alpha, how poetic it is then, that the final nail in the coffin, the Omega, is the loss of Lydia’s second (by then only) relationship that wasn’t defined by manipulation: the one to her daughter, Petra. No child could ever fit into the pattern of Lydia’s life. We do see her try to use her usual methods here, when she threatens her daughter’s bully, but ultimately a world where everything needs to be kept perfectly in tune is no place for a child. The piece that Lydia was composing in dedication to her daughter is never finished. Petra just doesn’t belong within that structure.\n\nAnd when we see Lydia making an attempt to actually enter into that world which exists beyond perfectly ironed shirt collars and Scandinavian interior design, it’s a catastrophe. The scene is horror-like in its entire set-up: dark, dripping tunnels and a dog that is framed as monstrous. My friend with whom I went, and who had even seen the film before, said afterwards, “I was sure that the dog would chase her.” It certainly seems like it will, as large and threatening as it is. But it never does. In fact it only barks once, and that’s enough to send Lydia running in terror. It’s all in her head. And yet she still ends up coming out of it bloodied and hurt, just from tripping on a set of stairs. “You could use some adjustment, you’re a bit crooked,” comes the doctor’s verdict afterwards. That is what the encounter did to her, or rather, what she did to herself. She came off beat. “I was attacked,” she lies to anyone who asks – anything else would be admitting defeat in the face of the real world. \n\nBut to then find out that Lydia – or rather, Linda – actually comes from that world, it is suddenly as if we are given the key to her whole being. She has spent a lifetime outrunning her own background, raising walls around herself to fend off a truth that she can’t bear to acknowledge. Here, Lydia’s currency of intellectualism and professional superiority, the only thing she truly understands, holds no value whatsoever. In this world she is no one. She comes from nothing. She is nothing. \n\nThe film’s ending is the ultimate anticlimax. Lydia, and so the audience, is denied the catharsis that would have come from a “One Last Show” moment of brilliance, one that, if indulged, might have implied that Lydia’s genius was worth the cost of everything else around her. Instead we get a truly pathetic moment of desperation, followed by a sequence that might seem to be leading to some kind of rebirth, but actually just fizzles out into something even more pathetic. My first question coming out of this film was, “What was her fatal flaw; what was she being punished for?” But ultimately I think that question holds very little merit. This isn’t a film about punishment and whether or not it is deserved. It is about guilt, and how prestige and acclaim can make someone think themselves divorced from any consequences for their actions and their issues. Faced with her own way of looking at other people, but taken to its most ludicrous extreme at a Thai massage parlor, not even Lydia herself can keep from vomiting in disgust.\n\nSeen like that, the film becomes less about “cancel culture,” and more of a statement on our obsession with “geniuses,” and what happens when a process that is very much collaborative in nature, becomes attributed to the ability of a single individual. This is of course highly relevant not only to classical music, but to cinema. What a powerful gesture then, to place the credits at the front end, leaving the audience no option but to acknowledge everyone behind this film. Production design, sound mixing/editing, wardrobe, score; all of them play such vital roles here, and so even though we spend the whole runtime in awe of Cate Blanchett’s masterclass performance, Tár, more than anything, becomes the film of all those people in the back, behind the curtain, in the shadows, outside the spotlight. This movie is theirs.",

I must say that the Photography is wonderful and enjoyed how colorful it was and made me wish Modern Movies were that colorful.

Trudi is eight years old.\n\n\"Would it bother you if I sat next to you and read my book too?\"\n\n\"I don't know... would you bother me?\"\n\n\"I'll try not to.\" \n\nTrudi then also talks a bit about how an actor should strive for perfection even though it is unattainable.\n\nNo way on earth is an eight year old that witty or that experienced enough to deliver those lines in real life. At first viewing, there really isn't an issue. There's nothing that's jarring. She looks and sounds like her age, but a closer look at the dialogue just doesn't add up. \n\nAnother example of what I'm trying to get at is this scene from [The Departed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC1o7xL6Q8k).

I loved the subtlety that many people missed, like for instance Seo-rae putting the finishing touches into Im Ho-sin just to protect Hae-joon. \n\nI don't agree with other commentators that there could have been another solution, especially because it seems Seo-rae already thought of them beforehand. I understand that the MBTI is a hoax, but it's so useful as a heuristic to assess other people, and Seo-rae is a definitive INTJ. Once she understood that Hae-joon discovered that she was a criminal, everything that would undermine him was connected to her. \n\nAnd while Hae-joon would willingly kill his career as a cop for her (as he already did before, and \"Killing is like smoking, only the first time is hard.\"), she found the only solution for her to show her love and ultimately be remembered. Hae-joon was never going to sleep soundly thinking of her whether she was free or incarcerated, so she found the elegant solution of prolonging the chase - and in that way be remembered forever by the man she also loved.\n\nI definitely think it's an improvement over Vertigo with the comedy and the more empathetic femme fatale.

It’s not too common in my experience because score is such an integral part of the filmmaking process, like editing, that you want to get it to at least a place of competency. A bad movie can’t be saved by a great score, but a great movie can be hurt by a bad score. \n\nI recently watched Stanley Kubrick’s Spartacus, after a user here cited it as an example of a score/film mismatch, and found I largely agreed with it. There are a few moments here and there that are great, but for most part I kept getting taken out of the movie by the overly schmaltzy string sections. Which just didn’t fit. \n\nWhat about you guys? Any scores you’ve got beef with?",

        "text": "Video version: https://youtu.be/9DYuUgUg5pk\n\nWatching The Shining after becoming a father is an altogether different experience\n\n\nOne of the remarkable things about movies is how they can change overtime without even changing. You can watch a film at a certain point in your life, and then return to it many years later, with it being a completely different experience, and the movie hasn’t changed – you’ve changed. You’ve grown as a human being, or otherwise had life experiences which have made you appreciate things a different way.\n\n\nI always liked The Shining. Brilliantly shot, wacky performances from Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall, and a great atmosphere. Loads of hidden details and theories about different aspects of the film, and the movie provides some outstanding visceral horror.\n\n\nBut when you become a father the movie becomes more poignant and much more scary, but not in the “Argh! A man in a bear costume!” kind of way.\n\n\nThis is a bit of a personal video, and I will preface this by saying I love my family to bits, but marriage and especially subsequent fatherhood is a huge responsibility, one that no training or counsel can prepare you for. All of a sudden, you are responsible for a human being, you are responsible for life, and all of your goals and desires (including the bond between your wife, which can often become strained when there are difficulties with children) take a backseat to the upbringing of your child.\n\n\nThis is something I think The Shining taps into a lot (the movie – the book is of course very different, with a lot of emphasis on Jack’s alcoholism and the abusive upbringing he had). Like with Jack’s writer ambitions, I have work I want to get done for my YouTube channel that often gets disturbed by the family. In fact, I’ve even found myself in situations where the Mrs might come to me while I’m on my laptop and talk talking about the weather, with me thinking “what do you want me to do about it?”, just like Jack. I’ve even been told to go to sleep when I’m working at 2 in the morning, replying that I can’t because I’ve got too much to do, just like with what Jack says to Danny. Heck, maybe my YouTube work is an allegory of the Overlook, both taking away time and attention from one’s family.\n\n\nAnd then there’s situations where, as I mentioned, your relationship with your spouse can become fractured because of events involving your kids (Jack dislocating Danny’s arm, for example). The subsequent tensions, frustrations and cold atmosphere’s that occur in the spousal relationship and family unit are perfectly captured by the film.\n\n\nCall it projection, but I imagine Jack and Shelly having a loving, care-free marriage and then the much-anticipated arrival of the child causing problems. Jack becomes jealous of the attention the new mother shows her child, perhaps? Becomes frustrated with the changes in her, and then guilty for having these kind of feelings. Resents her rather than come to terms with his inner demons, begins putting the work into Danny to give them the best of relationships, but blames his failure to do so on his wife, the easiest of targets – as shown when he tells the caretaker (“she…interferes.”). Jack’s mind is so warped that when his creepy behaviour causes Danny to ask him whether he would ever hurt him ad his mum, Jack’s immediate reaction is to ask if Danny’s mother told him this, rather then take a look in the mirror.\n\n\nOccasionally, as a father, you just feel like you need a break, a chance to get away from it all. It is unfortunate, selfish and embarrassing to admit, but there are moments where you blissfully daydream about them not being there. I’m not saying you fantasise about chasing your family around the house with an axe, but I think the ghosts in the Overlook take advantage of Jack’s insecurities, regrets, guilt and fears of his fatherhood, and there is something heavy there in the film that it manages to capture, and I finally realise why The Shining is hailed as one of the greatest psychological horror films of all time.\n\n\nJack is not a monster that hides in the closet, or attacks you in your dreams. He’s a real person, a husband and father, the head of the family, the source of security, comfort and stability. For him to change and his mind collapse, to turn on his own family in an isolated hotel in the middle of a storm no less, is a terrifying thought, a bastardization of nature. Because ultimately, that could be me, that could be you. Stranger things have happened. Jack is disturbing because at one point he was a completely normal man, but has now gone insane.\n\n\nPay attention to Jack, and you’ll notice him biting his lips at things his wife and son say, small gestures of frustration that manage to manifest and creep up to the surface. It resonates even more so what with the covid-19 lockdown, with families all around the world cooped up with each other in the same house, getting more and more tired of each other and desperate for a chance to just have a break from their own families.\n\n\nSo it’s quite the experience watching The Shining through the lens of fatherhood. I’ll leave you with a quote from Stephen King, the author of the book, which had many autobiographical element’s from King’s troubles with alcoholism and his relationship with his family.\n\n\nI wanted to grab them and hit them. Even though I didn't do it, I felt guilty because of my brutal impulses. I wasn't prepared for the realities of fatherhood",

The Tall Man is truly a great villain and unique in the pantheon of Horror villains, portrayed to perfection by the late, great Angus Scrimm in all five. And of course the iconic flying death spheres.\n\nFor any other fans here, how would you rank them? My ranking goes:\n\n\n* Phantasm II\n* Phantasm\n* Phantasm IV: Oblivion\n* Phantasm III: Lord Of The Dead\n* Phantasm V: Ravager\n\n\nThe original is a classic, but I think 2 simply took it to the next level. I enjoy how that film is so much like a vintage Survival Horror video game in movie form. 3 and 4 were also entertaining, but 5 was sadly a disappointment.\n\nIt's an overall strong series despite the fifth not being so great.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/10z561v/damian_chazelles_use_of_vulgarity_in_babylon/",
        "text": "I did a write up on Tyler Perry a long while back that touched on how when he did try to address things outside of his usual purview, often times it felt ten or twenty years behind. I used his relationship with the queer community as an example. I got a similar feeling at times watching Damian Chazelle's latest film 'Babylon'. There was a lot of vulgarity of all types and while I get that was the point, to make the golden age of Hollywood look more harsh and gritty, it didn't quite land the way I think he expected it to. While brash and in your face it feels exceptionally tame at the same exact time. Because of this, oftentimes the depictions of sex and vomiting and shitting and honestly all the insane shit that happens in this movie feels a bit trite. There are times when the rawness and vulgarity Chazelle is going for works. \n\nAny scene where they're actually trying to make a movie is absolutely some of the best cinema I've seen in a while. The introduction to the world of silent film is fantastic. Chazelle frames this side of the business with the same dynamic and dizzying energy he shot the first 40 minutes of the film with. It's intoxicating. The combination of danger, innovation, humor and anxiety that swirls together to create a brew of white knuckled exhilaration is one I'd sip from again and again. Brad Pitt constantly seconds away from certain death while going over lines, Margot Robbie constantly flubbing takes as the pressure cooker simmers, Manny racing across LA to get the right equipment all were fantastic. The swearing, bloodshed and overall dirtiness of these sequences is aided by the fact that it actually adds something to the point of the scene. You'd be dropping F bombs like they were nickels too if you were burning alive in a studio as everything went wrong. The cameraman dying at the end was the icing on the cake.\nNothing seems particularly gratuitous here, everything is in service of the scene and the story. \n\nWhat doesn't quite work is everything that isn't those scenes, but I'll focus on the first hour or so. It's basically a cocaine fueled orgy that communicates in nearly an hour what only needed 10 minutes. There's fat old white men getting peed on by hookers, there's an elephant shitting on you, there's a sea of pale bodies gyrating on each other under nothing but the influence of jazz and blow. It's a lot but at the same time it's nothing. What do we learn about Manny in this scene? He's determined and awe struck by the film world. What do we learn about Nellie? She likes to party and wants to be a star. What do we learn about Jack? He's listless yet also entirely caught up in his own hype. All of the respective scenes that get these points across take up roughly 15 to 20 minutes. Everything else we get on top of that does not. It's not that I'm a prude but it was sometime around when Margot Robbie gets swallowed and embraced by this ravenous yet oddly heteronormative mass of bodies that I started asking 'when does the story start?' \n\nThat's another thing: for as much as Chazelle attempted to show the extremity of everything it's still oddly sanitized. There is so little actual male homoeroticism in this movie despite it priding itself on its debauchery. I actually went back and watched the opening scene and I counted how many instances of male on male I could find and it was about three. Plenty of girl on girl though. Hell Lady Fay basically only exists to make out with Nellie and then get the fuck out of the movie. Yet any hint of gay intimacy or sexuality was either thrown into the background or not elaborated upon. I'm not saying I need twinks barebacking for three hours. But it plays into my overall point how a lot of the excess and maximalism is very restrained. Because at it's root this is still a movie about how great movies are. It doesn't seem very fond of the industry, which is fair, but it unequivocally comes down on the side of 'movies are magic'. So there's only so far it's willing to go in it's depictions of things like sex, drugs and all the things our mothers warned us against.\n\nWhenever it does approach anything close to actual commentary it either shies away from exploring it deeply or tosses in something over the top and gross. The best example is Nellie at the rich people party where she's trying to present herself as a proper lady. The scene is probably too long even without the way it ends but overall I thought it was effective. Nellie's speech in this sequence while not the best written monologue gets the point across well. She's not a part of this world and has learned she no longer aspires to be. Great stuff. So why must we bookend the scene with her vomiting? It's shocking but it's wholly unneeded. There was a perfectly good scene with a solid arc within it. Chazelle wields sex and vulgarity the same way a child does after finding his dad's gun.\nThere is a fascination and an amusement present but not a demonstrated understanding of what he's handling. This is extremely apparent in how he treats his queer and non white characters. \n\nEarlier I asked what we learned about the central characters from the opening scene. Let's go deeper: what did we learn about Lady Fay? She's Asian, she's hot and she's into women. What's her inner pathos, wants or needs? Who knows. We don't really ever find out later in the movie either. What did we learn about Sidney? He's Black and plays jazz. We don't even learn his name until much later on. We never learn much about him besides he wants to play music in the movies and be respected for his art. He gets that one blackface scene and then he's out of the movie. Neither he nor Fay truly feel like actual characters. Instead they feel like props created to get across the most tepid of middle of the road liberal messages: 'hey did you guys know that the film industry was racist?' 'did you know that homophobia was bad?' This is funny when you take into account that Chazelle genuinely was trying to create some solid representation while taking shots at the industry of the past and today. The original script I read months ago gave Sidney and Fay a bit more to do. He even had a love interest. This version of the script was a lot more critical about the industry's treatment of Black and Asian artists and was more pointed about how this was reflected in the product we got. I'm not in Damian Chazelle's head so I can't tell you exactly what he was thinking. But the fact that these scenes got cut only proves my point about restrained excess. He's willing to show as much straight sex, drug use, bodily fluids and a guy eating a rat as he can. But he or maybe rather the studio is less game about getting realistic about how racism has shaped the industry and the movies we love. \n\nLady Fay is an interesting case because the goal appears to be to show an Asian woman during that time period that didn't conform to common held stereotypes. I will admit she is pretty interesting. She's cool tempered, clearly intelligent and isn't really afraid of anything. But in attempting to combat other stereotypes they fell right into another one: the exotified and sexualized Asian woman. We get almost no real insight into her character outside of her attraction to a white woman. The references that exist to her culture and background are presented in a very Orientalist manner. She's beautiful yet mysterious. She's alluring yet there's an element of danger to her. The only thing that sets her apart from actual stereotypical characters of the era is that she's queer. Even then, we only see her flirt with women and kiss Nellie. The film is remarkably chaste as it regards it's depictions of sexuality in general. While the opening orgy has a lot of quick shots of drug fueled rabbit pumping, we never get any actual sex scenes. Nellie and Manny never do much more than kiss. We never see Jack with anyone. The closest we get is The Whale getting pissed by on a hooker. The film wants to be sexy but it doesn't want to elaborate on that sexuality. \n\nI don't need two hours of some white guy calling Jovan Adepo the N Word. But it is somewhat shocking to me how very little overt racism is faced by any of the major non white characters. It peeps up here and there but it's not focused on outside of one scene involving blackface. Why be subtle here? You have no problem showing dead hookers, all manner of bodily fluids, snake bites, people get lacerated yet you draw the line at showing racism with that same rawness and intensity? Even the blackface scene is ridiculous. Even when we see the footage of Sidney without makeup he looks like a Black man. Maybe the role was written with a lighter skinned Black man in mind. But as is, I actually laughed at the scene. When they show him with the makeup on, it's not much of a difference. You can say 'oh we're supposed to laugh at the absurdity of it' but we also have eyes. The basic premise doesn't work. There are tons of other examples of real life racism faced by Black performers in that era they could've actually pulled from. Not much mention is given to the fact that Sidney probably couldn't even eat at many of the places he performed. There is some irony in that it's the Mexican man who both tells the Black man to put on blackface and then fires the Asian woman. But the movie never really explores that.\n\nWhile we're here, let's talk about Manny. Diego Calva delivers a solid enough performance for what he's given but I find how Manny was handled to be interesting as well. Even in the script I read, there wasn't much attention given to Manny's ethnicity which is interesting because this script is set during a time in which there absolutely would've been. Latinos resided in a strange grey area in the American racial caste system. While they weren't considered outright white, they weren't seen as Black either. Although this depended a lot on if the person in question was white, mestizo, Indigenous or Black. Delores del Rio was a Mexican actress who spent most of her career playing exotic types of any ethnicity. But she often portrayed herself to have basque heritage and downplayed whatever other heritage she might have. She was able to portray herself as a sophisticated Spanish lady and while playing exotic roles rarely played the hypersexualized and racialized characters women like Rita Moreno would play not long after her. I bring Delores up because when Manny mentions at one point he's actually mostly Spanish it reminded me of how actual stars back then would market themselves. But that's basically it. It gets brought up here and there with a few sly remarks about him speaking English but otherwise it's not a focus. Which again is weird since there is a lot you can do with the concept of a Mexican man, one who does not immediately read as white, entering the Hollywood machine at the advent of sound. Hollywood previously was relatively diverse for the time as the movie does show. That diversity was quickly washed away as studios began to solidify what 'Americanness' was as the Hayes Code took effect. There are traces of this transition here and there but much more attention is placed elsewhere. The racial elements read as an afterthought in the final product. It's as if Chazelle felt as if he had to include these pieces because audiences would expect it, but he didn't know quite where to go with it. But directly critiquing this forced homogeneity would also be taking aim at the films themselves and that would run counter to Chazelle's ode to films and the filmmaking process. \n\nManny's relationship with Nellie is interesting to me for a somewhat different reason. In the script I read, I remember them actually hooking up at some point. They don't in the movie and the film portrays Manny as someone who idolizes Nellie more as a symbol of Hollywood and the movie making process as a whole. She's the beautiful, glamorous blonde girl who seems to have been tailor made for the pictures. I actually thought at one point they were going to reveal he was a closeted gay man because his slavish devotion and adoration of her is not dissimilar from the way gay men treat our divas. But no Manny is a boring ole straight boy who happens to be fascinated with the most toxic chick in the world. I actually don't mind that they never actually become a couple because the point isn't if he gets the girl, it's if he realizes the girl and what she represents are no good for him. There's flashes of this realization here and there, but we never get a moment where Manny unpacks the connection of the two in his mind. But what fascinates me the most about Manny is how thoroughly desexualized he is. He rebuffs several women's advances, he shows no interest in Lady Fay like most of the other men, he doesn't partake in any of the coke orgy we see in the beginning. \n\nOne could read this as a response to the Latin lover stereotype. It is interesting to me how this very ethnic man lusts for this blonde waifish white woman for three hours yet he never gets more than a kiss from her. Sexually we only see her involved with or implied to be with white men. But moreso, Manny's storyline just feels like a wasted opportunity. He never comes to any realizations that stick on his own about the people in his life or the world he lives in. His character arc is almost purely external. He doesn't make the choice to leave Los Angeles, not really. He's too weak of a cinnamon roll to say no to Nellie and Jack and thus he gets dragged into their spheres. If his ethnicity was more involved in his storyline and his disillusionment came from how he personally was treated, I think the film would've been stronger for it. \n\nThe movie finally decided to have an actual plot in the last hour or so as Nellie returns to Manny asking for help with her gambling debts. This storyline gives us nothing but the most useless depiction of shock and vulgarity Chazelle has to offer. Manny meets with some shady loan shark played by Toby McGuire who was told he was going to be in a Blumhouse production if we're to go by his performance. Chazelle channels his inner Paul Thomas Anderson and gives us that one scene with the drug dealer in Boogie Nights and then decides to make the next ten minutes or so a James Wan film. We're taken into this underground labyrinth of deformed freaks, masticated men in bondage gear being whipped and giant muscle men eating rats. This is all to set up that Toby McGuire finds out the money they're giving them is fake which could've been done five different ways than how they did it. Without this, we wouldn't get some of the freakiest and disturbing imagery in the film. But to what end does it serve? I'd argue not much. It doesn't expand on any of the themes or really result in any character growth. It gets Manny out of Los Angeles but there were other ways of doing this that didn't require nearly an hour more of content. The scene is vulgarity for the sake of vulgarity. This might have actually been palatable if not for how Chazelle chose to end the film. \n\nThe ending isn't actually wholly bad. I picked up on the 'Singin' in the Rain' comparisons early on myself so Manny literally watching it at the end didn't throw me much. What did throw me was that ending montage that felt one of those 'gee aren't movies great' compilations we get at the Oscars. If you had cut that and honestly most of the flashbacks and the weird color stuff, the ending would've worked. It wouldn't have made the film a masterpiece for me but it would've felt complete. However the ending as is speaks to as why the film treats it's subject matter what it does. Hollywood is a seedy overindulgent machine and chews and spits people out. But isn't it great that either way those same people get to be remembered for all time in the movies? Jean Smart's monologue towards the end is basically just her saying this in not so many words. But there is a distinct difference between that monologue, which could almost be read as ironic, and basically shooting your load over how amazing the final product in the process is. \n\nLastly, what strikes me about Chazelle's approach to this film is how old hat it feels at times. On a technical level, it's a wonder throughout. But outside of that I can't help that we've seen this before. Plenty of people have made comparisons to Wolf of Wall Street and Baz Luhrmann's filmography. But it also reminded me of Ryan Murphy's HollyWood which takes a similar approach but focuses a lot more on those who were marginalized at the time. Sidenote: it's not very good. But my point is that we get these kind of projects about the industry pretty regularly. We get films that actually do push boundaries as it concerns sexuality and race. Television has far outpaced film in this regard. One season of Game of Thrones can brace most people for a lot of the debauchery they'll see in Bablyon. Chazelle's biggest problem is that his movie came out in 2022, not 1972. We live in a day and age where the dirty details of Hollywood and it's stars are well known. Stories about corrupt industry practices and those who commit them are regular headlines. So what exactly is the draw for the modern viewer to go to the theater to see this kind of film when they could just pop on a YouTube video essay on their smart TV at home? Sex, drugs and excrement don't shock as viscerally as it did. While all three can be effective if used wisely, they are very much not used in that fashion in Bablyon. I've heard some people speculate that Bablyon is going to become a cult classic and get reevaluated in the oncoming years and I can see it. But for now, while I think the attempt was valid I overall see this film as a misfire with stray moments of brilliance.",

I could see Justin Hurwitz putting his signature touches on existing songs with Chazelle fitting them into a narrative.\n\nIf he’s not going to do another musical, I’d like to see him break out of his comfort zone. I could totally see him doing a heist movie. Something like Ocean’s Eleven or Thomas Crown Affair. \n\nI could also see him doing horror. That would be interesting.

        "text": "I have always been one of the view that Romeo &amp; Juliet ought to be a satire on the face of the society and their beliefs. Different adaptations have presented it differently. Oft, it is a sentimental one. Due to my limitations with Shakespeare, I would not attempt to bring much of the original material and the theatre side of this story. \n\nLuhrmann is a unique director. I had read the Ol' F. Scott, like all of us do when we start out reading 'real' literature. I wanted to see an adaptation of The Great Gatsby and Luhrmann delivered. It wasn't the greatest, however it was striking in its own ways. \n\nThis was not my first-time watching R+J. It has always stood out as an adaptation to everyone. One cannot make sense if this is something inanely comical or is it attempting a meaning deeper and wider than the eccentricities that run throughout. \n\nFor the first half-hour of the film, we see Romeo desolate and heartbroken, drowning in grief so common of a youth in love. I think, throughout the film, I have often found the Church as a central motif. Despite the whole cry of youth and tragedy, the truth seems to be that this society is as fickle as the strength of passion that the young ones observe - whether it is in duel, love, or politics. The friar, though dismayed by the turn of Romeo's affection from the one he had grieved for months to another whom he had not known for a fortnight. However, to pursue his mission of peace and ending of suffering, he attempts to bring the two houses together. If we look at this attempt, it is not without motive. It is another reminder of how to bring good upon a world which has turned bad, good ones would end up use methods of hook and crook to bring it (and may in the process become bad themselves). However, such methods never really do succeed. This is also followed up when eventually no peace is brought, and nothing is achieved even after the banishment of both of the houses.  \n\nThe film was very unique. Luhrmann does not nearly get enough points for his creativity. I think, this is a problem in many of his films. He has a huge array of ideas, by themselves, they stand in distinction. However, in the process of bringing it all together, the production suffers from a sort of exhaustion. We see the pace and tempo of the story and storytelling drop or rush a number of times in his films. Despite the eccentricities that turn one mad from laughter, it lacks in continuity. It is simply because not all scenes can be performed unconventionally. Some of the dialogues carry such depth and substance that they are performed in nearly the same original manner as of theatre performance despite a very different background set altogether. \n\nThe TV presentation of display of scene was quite brilliant. The introduction of characters from different ethnicities was good for me, personally. Since I am not from the states, therefore I am not sure if my opinion is politically correct to state. So, please do correct me. The setting of a modern Verona was not complete, but still it was pretty darn good to pull it off to the level they did. The political aspect does not exactly fit but we make do because the prospect of Shakespearean dialogue in modern day urban surroundings and people is simply hilarious as well as inspires curiosity. In other ways, this film made Shakespeare much more relatable. Despite the dialogue which would usually be taken by the uninitiated masses to be dull or obscure is now received much more due to the nature of delivery and setting. I think, last I checked, a lot of high school teachers would use this film to introduce Shakespeare to students.\n\nThis film definitely has an all-star cast. Some of the most legendary names of the times and to-be were in the movie. The acting by Leonardo, Pete Postlethwaite, and Harold Perrineau is really good. The appearance of names like Paul Sorvin (always remember him as Paulie) and Claire Danes (Carrie from Homeland) is also fairly pleasing. Overall, the acting was fantastic. This also included John Leguizamo who played the role of Tybalt. My favorite character in the film was Mercutio (played by Harold Perrineau). \n\nIn all, the movie is a good fun watch. It has more than its share of humor for a tragedy. The absurd juxtaposition of the dialogues and scene will break one's laughter out more than once. The comical scenes of Petrol Pump Shootout, and Mercutio's night out are hilarious. \n\nHowever, for the film to reach the level of greatness, it was piggybacking more than it was okay to on Shakespeare. The movie presented to us an approach of a story that rings true through space and time. But this is a theme that is much more effectively communicated by the original play, by itself. The success of consequent adaptations depends much upon the universality of Shakespeare's message which have the capability to cross boundaries. It is a material, which by itself creates an unachievable standard. The man was a phenomenon by himself in the English world. Therefore, any attempt to adapt his work often fall short (mostly). So much so, it becomes a matter of fact that their success is measured in terms of how closely were they able to imitate the greatness and universality of the original material. \n\nIt is a great watch, with its fair share of flaws. As a Shakespearean adaptation, it falls short. For the novelty it brings, it is definitely deserving of a view by everyone at least once in their life. It is humorous, funny, and relatable in its own ways. \n\nAlso, I felt by the end of it, that the influence of Shakespeare is so strong and his body of work so expansive that the desire to adapt it will always be there in the mind of every filmmaker (or artist, playwright, writer). \n\n\\-----\n\nCritic Views: Roger Ebert - Quite Critical; Berardinelli - Meh, but Cool;\n\nAnecdote: Miriam Margolyes' This Much is True",

        "text": "Usually whenever we talk about directors and their best work it is mainly centred around which of them made their best work as their first film ( like Orson Welles with Citizen Kane). From what I have seen majority of the directors do their best work in their earlier years during their first few feature films and their first few decades in the job. After that it is mainly a slow decline as their works get less and less successful both critically and commercially until one day they just retire. I think Tarantino who seems obsessed with the idea of the quality of his filmography puts it this way when talking about Howard Hawks (one of his favorite filmmakers) that even though Hawks made a lot of great films he also in the end had a decline due to which not all of his films were great and Tarantino wants to avoid that for himself which is why he has stuck to the 10 films and retire goal.\n\n\nI am actually more interested to know which directors went out with a bang. Which directors did some of their best work during the final years of their career? I get that this is a difficult question to answer since it is extremely difficult for a director to surprise in their later years when an audience is already primed to their tricks by watching their earlier films.",

The film was apparently a nightmare to make and was panned by critics, who felt that it didn't resemble the game and it failed at the Box Office.\n\nTo be honest, I don't care what anyone says, I love this movie, Bob Hoskins is perfect as Mario and I love Dennis Hopper as King Koopa. I also think The Sets look fantastic. I will admit that it fails as a Mario Movie, but it is great as a Steampunk movie. I always thought It was a movie you really want to hate because of just how troublesome it is, but somehow, you end up liking it.  Does it have its problems, of course. But for me it has somehow always worked. I unironically love it. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on Super Mario Bros 1993? Do you like it?",

        "text": "So Black Panther: Wakanda Forever has been nominated for five categories which is great, but something has been bugging me ever since the nominations came out. Top Gun: Maverick was nominated for best film. Now, it's not like I don't like the film, the Academy probably put it int the category to get more viewers. But it's certainly not the standard kind of film that woud get a nomination.\n\nWhat's funny is that I've seen no articles, no 20 minute rant videos on YT with thousands of views, no long posts on reddit about how Top Gun didn't deserve to be on the Oscars. But here even the best film nomination for Black Panther gets criticism from everyone, including marvel fans. I still remember the amount of pushback against Black Panther's oscar campaign and nomination in 2018 and 2019. It seems to still be a controvertial topic to this day. \n\nI just thought it was funny that these two franchises, with big budget action film blackbusters had such different reactions from the public. Why do you all think that there's been no pushback against Top Gun, like there was against Black Panther?",

        "text": "I recently watched Ghost in the Shell (1995) and then I suppose out of curiosity I watched the remake. I wasn't a fan, I thought the visuals were decent if a little half baked, but the story was uninteresting and lacked really any of the philosophical weight of the original. But as a Hollywood blockbuster it was never going to be for me. \n\nThe thing most people think about concerning Ghost in the Shell is the firestorm around Scarlett Johansson playing a major (lol) role that could have been given to an Asian actress. Interestingly instead of ignoring the possible incongruity, since the character is a cyborg that does not need to be any one race, the movie decides to lean into it with a third act twist. It turns out the Major was an Asian girl sharing the name of the protagonist of the original, stolen by the Hanka corporation and implanted in Scarlet Johansson.\nI’m hoping it’s been long enough since 2017 to have a conversation about this because I’m not sure what to think. On one hand I think it’s commendable that the filmmakers didn’t brush past the controversy and decided to include white washing as a theme of the story. And while the commentary doesn't change the fact that the character was white washed, I’m sure the writer and director and casting director didn’t have a choice in the matter, Johannson is just too big a star to pass up. On the other hand, it might be a stretch to even call white washing a theme. You could change the race of her mother, or even remove the subplot all together and have roughly the same movie. We may never know, but I think it’s possible the movie was changed after the initial blowback to include some justification. Speculation, but I didn’t see any other commentary on Hollywood or race relations. \n\nAnyway I couldn’t find anyone else online talking about this aspect of the movie so I was curious to hear more voices than my own.",

Well to not be brutally harsh on my self i must say that i kind of have the general idea of what's going on when watching these kind of films and a sense of the vibe in it,but i find it extremely hard to admit that i understood the scenes in the movie, i have tried many things, i tried to watch them in different approaches, sad, happy, focused, relaxed, or in my normal mood, but it's just not working for me, and i seek advice, what should i do or change in order to have a better experience with these types of films.\nSometimes i think i cannot understand except a tip of these type of films because of the differences between me and the general audience of these films, I am an arab ex-muslim in my early twenties, so basically i don't have that much knowledge, culture, upbringings (call it whatever you may) that an european from a christian background would have, and sometimes i think that this is the main reason, the fact that some of these films spotlight issues and portray details that are rather irrelevant to me or my surrounding, but i find that statement to be ironically not completely true, as most of the scenes that i think i understood were the ones talking about god and religion (unless they are trying to convey a symbolic image of some historical events related to Christian history in Europe, rather than being a theological idea) in addition to the fact that i feel very comfortable with westren cultures and values and actually feelbthat it's a better fit than my original culture that i feel alienated in, and that's why i don't go very harsh on myself but i would really appreciate an advice or two.\n\nI want to continue watching filma as these as they have an enormous amount of feel and vibe, and also because i truly believe they have the most artistic, emotional and philosophical values that i personally seek, but i just want to do it in a way that i would be personally content and loving   it evsn more, rather than eventually giving up watching resulting from my despair in trying to absorb these works if i keep doing it the way a currently do.",

        "text": "It had been a long time since I had wanted to watch this one. The noise around the Academy winners had remained high. In fear of not spending too much of my time in another mainstream high production commercial flick, I subconsciously kept away. \n\nThis was the same concern I had shared for Birdman. Director Iñárritu excels himself in technical filmmaking. This is a marvelously beautiful film. Like I had said of Cinematographer Lubezki in my review of Birdman - The cinematography is intrinsic in the storytelling. \n\nIñárritu has received a great amount of flak for making technical films that are highly luminous but somewhat lack in substance and/or depth. The charge is such that we find people on both sides of the discussion. AGI's films heavily invested in the technical aspects which seem to raise what are simpler (even derivative) dialogues into the appearance of more than that. \n\nRegardless of the many sides of the debate, and also taking into account that my feeling towards the film may change with time. As of now, I was totally taken by the entire film. For the entire length of it, I just found my gaze fixed on the entire scene. Never did I find myself wide-eyed so many times in a single film. Despite the fact that there are films with more graphic and violent scenes, The Revenant evokes a certain palpitation that is felt rather deeply. \n\nThe credit for the entire experience of the film is greatly shared by Emmanuel Lubezki. This gentleman to me seems to deserve half of the credit of direction. Films as they developed in the initial part of history were praised with the sentence, \"It's like you are actually there with the characters.\" In The Revenant, due to camera work, one definitely feels like actually being alongside. The camera work is smooth, but still imbalanced enough to create realistic movement. The switching between characters and motion styles (walking, running, and riding horse) is unmatched. The staging of close ups is \"Up Close and Personal\". Each shot creates a certain level of intimacy that keeps you near the character. This is followed up by the wider shots which combined with the closer ones keeps the viewer engaged thoroughly. For this reason, I feel that, to me, the cinematography was the true storytelling mechanism. \n\nI think Leonardo is definitely a great actor. However, I didn't see him fit the performance nearly well enough. I think, to me, greatest motivation (aside from Iñárritu, Lubezki) to watch the film when it came out was - \"Oh well, Leo finally got his Oscar, huh?!\". Honestly, I didn't even find this to be his best performance. He was good, nay excellent. However, I think that his best performance was in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. It was good, in a weird way, to know that a lot of filmgoers felt that way. Tom Hardy was bloody good. Watching Paul Anderson (Mr. Arthur Shelby) anywhere, even for a moment, is fun. The acting was first class, in all sections. Of course, I have to check on the Pawnee and Arikara dialects. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegarding the film itself:\n\nDue to its nature and my personal associations, I must say that it was in some ways a rather painful experience. The scene where his new met Pawnee acquaintance and rescuer is hanged by the Frenchmen is soul crushing followed by the scene where Powaqa (the Arikara girl) is held captive and abused by the traders. On the plaque hung around the Pawnee man, it said, \"*On est tou des savages*\" (We (native tribes) are all savages). It seemed to me that when men are capable of killing so mercilessly without care and consideration, with prejudice and contempt, aren't we all (French, English, Civilized, Wild, Foreigner, Native), all savages. \n\nThe scenes in middle also showed of a fact that these foreigners and the natives, despite the discrimination of tongue, skin, food, culture, they were same. When the Arikara chief is tracking Powaqa, he detects by smelling and later on, Fitzgerald on entering the devastated camp of tribals does the same to detect a presence. Regardless of the prejudice shared among people, on a common land (common nature), all humans come to similar understanding of how to live. This is repeatedly understood in the fact of Hugh Glass's survival. He is white in his skin, and English (American) in his tongue. As we understand, he can't be a Pawnee, not in this life. Yet, when he pushes through the wilderness and sickness, he or any other person will do the same things to survive. \n\nA lot of people had spoken about the creative addition of the wife and child. For me, personally, it was a great addition. A lot of the dream scenes were vivid and gave more depth to the storytelling. \n\nI think, regardless of the different thoughts around how to view Iñárritu's filmmaking. I genuinely think he is brilliant in being able to manifest the very technical excellence that exalt his film. The choice of his cinematographers and editors (both constant) is great. \n\nOther films by Iñárritu:\n\nI had watched 21 Grams, simply because it had Benecio in it. It was truly excellent. I have yet to see Biutiful. The praise of Javier Bardem for this film is truly very high.",
