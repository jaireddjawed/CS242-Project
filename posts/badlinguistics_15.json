If you excuse the bizarre phrasings... I mean, I can get at the general notions behind these listed objects, but honestly it's written so disgustingly vague it makes me physically cringe to read it over.\nWhat the fuck is a \"Western European style\" exactly in terms of syntax?",

        "text": "https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QBVGA8LQzUo\n\n(see comments by Schamim Schunna -- can't link them directly at the moment, as I'm on my cellphone)\n\nApparently, the big elephant in the room is the \"Indo\" in Proto-Indo-European! Proof that PIE is Sanskrit and that the Indo-Europeans came from India!!\n\nAlso, the most grammatically similar languages in the family are the Nordic and east Indian languages, obviously. And, of course, shoddily compiled lists of cognates between English and Sanskrit prove that English is from Sanskrit!\n\nExplanation: Why this is bad linguistics should be clear from the replies to these comments and from Linguistics 101 plus some common sense, but to summarise, the existence of cognates demonstrates relation, not the direction of descent. Historical linguistics isn't just comparing lists of words, finding sloppy correlations between the first few sounds of words, and ignoring the rest of the sounds. Modern terminology like \"Indo-European\" can't be used to prove anything about ancient realities. The North Germanic languages are not closest to the east Indian languages -- a few cursory glances at descriptive grammars for these languages should show why. Sanskrit is a descendant of PIE, not the proto language itself. This is the scholarly consensus based on over a century of extensive reconstructive work which uncovers systematic sound correspondences in languages to decode how languages have developed through time. Evidence from other fields like archaeology support the IE theory over this conspiratorial Sanskrit one.",
