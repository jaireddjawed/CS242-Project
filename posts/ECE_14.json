        "text": "I have a project for a class and am using the opportunity to get more acquainted with LTSpice, however I'm using the Mac version which seems rare. Not very many tutorials for it. \n\nI've been trying to follow this guide:  [http://www.zen22142.zen.co.uk/ltspice/newsymbols.htm](http://www.zen22142.zen.co.uk/ltspice/newsymbols.htm)\n\nI've created a new component by drawing a rectangle and adding ports. I even saved it into the correct symbols folder (though it's hidden in the Application package on the Mac -- used CTRL+Shift+G to go directly to the folder) and saved it. It shows up in my Finder window. However after restarting and trying to add the component, it doesn't show up in the component list at all. I'm wondering if I'm missing a step. Any help or resources?\n\nMore deets:\n\n\\- The description in the attribute table was \"Half Adder\"\n\n\\- Prefix is A, Value is A. No other attributes given.\n\n\\- When opening the symbol again in LT Spice it gives me the error: \"Unknown Symbol Syntax: Version 0\" but it still opens.\n\n\\- I also always get the following error though it is probably unrelated since this has happened since installing LT Spice: \"You have not updated you LTspice software in 670 days. Please go to the Control Panel Operation Tab and execute Software Update.\" (And I've tried to update it and no way has worked -- though tips to make this error go away also will be appreciated)",

        "text": "**IDEA:**\n\nIdea is to read the audio samples off the SD card reader, feed it to the [DAC (4821)](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/22244B.pdf) to generate a corresponding analog value. Then amplify it through LM386 audio amp and pass it through the speaker.\n\n**Initial Issue:**\n\nThis was the [code](https://wandbox.org/permlink/Ij4fbrqQ6phRSUUQ) that I used first. I wasn't too aware of the delay I was adding (20ms). Nevertheless, when I ran it, the [output looked like this](https://imgur.com/a/o0uywxf). The frequency was 24Hz which was too low (still not able to figure out why this low) and obviously won't be able to hear much through the speaker.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nSo I realized I was making a dumb mistake by setting the delay to 20ms considering I am dealing with a `44.1KHz` audio file where samples are `~22.6us` apart. I went on and used a `millis()` function and ensured I was sending out that fast but then I didn't see anything on the scope below 5ms. [Here's the modified code](https://wandbox.org/permlink/eKgS3L1jRj08oIpl).\n\nWhat might be the cause? Am I not supposed to read that fast? Seems to be something with timing. \n\n**EDIT:**\n\nHardware: Arduino UNO\n",

Understandably, since the entire floor is guys, it could be an intimidating/undesirable place to work in for a female candidate.  It seems like bigger companies are better at attracting female talent (anecdotally, all the women I know from engineering school went to larger ones), but they had to start from 0 at some point right?\n\nOf course, the pool of women engineers is still just way smaller than male.  But how could they/you be reached specifically, without seeming condescending?  Women engineers, how comfortable would you be/are you working in an otherwise all-male setting?  What would make you want to start working somewhere as the first and only woman on the team?  Maybe some of you wouldn’t care at all.\n\nMaybe I’m just overthinking it and just like for anyone, it’s got to come down to the right salary/location/benefits and exposure.

But I have always been fond of the idea of creating my own device's. Unlike programming though, a general term such as electrical engineering is so broad and overwhelming that I have trouble sorting through online and in text resources. College classes aren't an option either since I can't afford it, and college classes tend to go SUPER SLOW. I hated the snail's pace teaching style when I was taking computer programming courses.\n\nMy Goals: I want to build my own electronic computers and device's. some things I could list would be guitar pedals, an MP3 player, a dumb phone, a 6502 based computer (like an Apple 1 or something similar). I know these are far off and require a lot of knowledge but that's just an idea of things I'd like to be able to make. I'm much more of a hobbyist if anything so I don't really care for becoming an engineer. I just want to make cool stuff.\n\nMy Experience: I've been programming for years and have a really good understanding of data structures and math. You need a whole lot of math for 3D rendering. I also have some barebones assembly experience and understand the structure of computers and CPU's. I understand that a MOS transistor can hold a low or high voltage acting as our binary bit. That's the extent of electrical engineering I know.\n\nNote: I learn best through hands on experience and it would be great if you guys know any resources catered to that. But really that's just me being picky.\n\nTL;DR - can't/don't wanna go to college for electrical engineering. free or cheap resources on learning electrical engineering.

Would that still work? Is there another component I should use instead?\n* RFID Antenna: Is there a particular RFID antenna I should be using? I'm reticent to using the ones designed to detect tags 10 meters away, because I just want to know if there is a tag in a box or not, where the antenna would be placed within 1 meter.\n* RFID Modules: If I can avoid building my own RFID reader from scratch and just use an existing one that I can interface with through USB, that would be the best option since there is less risk. However, I am having trouble finding an RFID reader that doesn't cost up to hundreds of dollars.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n",

        "text": "This is a followup to this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/8yu07z/microcontroller_freezing_up_when_i_connect_a_motor/  \n  \nI have a microcontroller that is outputting a PWM to transistor connected to a small DC motor. The duty cycle is controlled by a IR signal coming from a remote control. Whenever the duty cycle gets too high, the amount of inductive noise from the motor causes my micro controller to freeze up.   \n\nI tried different solutions including adding inductors in series with the motor to create a filter, increasing the transistor base resistor, adding capacitors, but nothing fixed the issue. I decided to use an optocoupler to isolate the motor from the microcontroller. This is the setup: https://imgur.com/Te0dbGA  \n  \nI was sure the optocoupler method would work, but it didn't. [This](https://imgur.com/CL9hbxq) is what the noise looks like. I zoomed in to one inductive spike. I expected the optocoupler to work as it electrically isolates the motor side with he microcontroller side. I am using the 4N26 optocoupler. The only things I can think of that could cause noise from coupling to the input side is that the spikes could couple through the parasitic capacitance of the breadboard, or the generated RF noise is somehow making it through to my microcontroller. The microcontroller is powered by USB from my laptop, so maybe that has something to do with it. Sounds pretty far fetched though.\n  \nFinally, i decided to use a different motor. The one I was initially using was a small motor I pulled out of a broken toy, and this new motor was a new larger motor. It's packaging says 6-12V 0.14A. For some reason I do not understand, the new motor did not have the same issue as the old one. The noise was very little and I could adjust the duty cycle the entire range without my micro-controller freezing. What could be the reason for that? I would expect a larger motor to create more noise. \n \nA different issue I am having with this larger motor is that it doesn't start rotating until my duty cycle is 30-40%. But then when it starts rotating I can decrease the duty cycle down to around 15% until it stops. Why is that?",

It seems they are driven with a buffer (two inverters in series). What is the reason for doing that? Do these buffers function like unity gain voltage buffers? Why do the sizes of the inverters keep increasing in the buffer chain driving the power MOSFETs? ",

Like I know it says it’s tested from 300k to multi gig and LCRs can do way lower frequency. Why is that? Isn’t it just a coupled waveform response from like a particular tone or a wave generated at some frequency, then the response wave is measured. \n\nIt’s a DAC -&gt; DUT -&gt; ADC yeah? Can’t a VNA measure down to near DC? Would the VSWR be incalculable. \n\nIs it all because of the characteristic impedance? If i say Z0 was 10k it could measure around there? Is it because we design circuits around 50 ohms (and I know why we do that vs like 33, 75, 100 ohm terminations) and that’s the only reason? \n\nIt doesn’t seem that an LCR meter is used just for cost since they mention higher accuracy? How does it have higher accuracy vs a VNA for component characterization? \n\n\nSay I want to measure some X7R cap or a couples inductor. I’m a fly back designer and I need to characterize my components around the maximum switching frequency. say it’s a GaN switcher and I’m using 1MHz, couldn’t I just use a VNA for that characterization? Why the heck are LCR meters used? \n\nAlso what the hell is the RF IV measurement. Never heard of it! Does it use Rogowski coils to do the current measurement or Current Sense Resistors.

He’ll rewrite the firmware with a basic python GUI, as well as design proper schematics for safety so it can pass as a medical device if approvals are needed - great work, really excited. \n\nI’m wondering though, to produce this amount of work is 2 months a bit long? \n\nI’m a doctor so by no means a professional engineer hence the lack of insight of realistic timelines. Would love thoughts!",

        "text": "So my lecturer for my electrical class at uni occasionally hands out challenges “to stimulate the mind and get you  students to think outside the box”. A few weeks ago he gave out this  challenge:\n\n*'Find a way to set up a simple electrical circuit that allows you  to power a single light bulb. Then, with the same circuit, replace the  single light bulb with 10 others, and power them simultaneously.'*\n\nRules for the circuit:\n\n* You cannot use a variable resistor.\n* Each light bulb must be identical.\n* The power source must give out consistent power. (ie. If you're using a motor to spin a rotor, the motor must be at a constant speed)\n\nThis is my first semester at uni, and I feel like my knowledge is  limited here. The way I see it is that if you can power 1 light bulb,  you don’t have enough power to light up 10. But if you can light up 10,  then that power would pop 1 light bulb. For that reason surely you can’t  just use a battery. Without a variable resistor or power variance, how  can you power two circuits with different loads with the same amount of  power?\n\nEDIT:\n\nI had a classmate come up with something. He had handmade solenoids  (weighing 60grams) set up in a formation similar to what you’d find in a  computer cooling fan. Using that as an alternator (he had a small motor  powering it with a 12V battery), plain copper wires and LEDs from  jaycar he was able to answer the challenge. \n\nHe showed us using a multimeter voltages of 1.5V for a single LED and 1.3V for 10 LEDs, while the current was sitting at 0.11A for both setups. All lights illuminated, although the set of 10 in parallel were dimmer. Now, when he attempted to use handmade coils with more windings  (weighing 120grams so it was significantly larger), he achieved up to 5V  and 0.1A. But he said that popped the single LED and failed to illuminate the 10 LEDs. He claimed the large coils were able to  illuminate up to 8 LEDs, anything more and no light. Could I please get a  possible explanation for this? Shouldn’t there be enough power to  illuminate the 10 LEDs considering the smaller one was able to, AND there was enough power to pop a single LED whereas the other did not?\n\n\\*Note: Talks of an interaction with Lenz's Law and Back EMF are taking place. I just thought I'd add that, even though I'm cynical about somehow bypassing such a law.",

        "text": "I've been going through Pozar and Razavi for quite a while now. I wanted to learn more about power amplifier designs, and not just at the IC level but using them in RF Systems perspectives. Also don't see much of a point in getting into Lee outside of a refrence, even though I have the book since I think Pozar and Razavi do a good job intro wise. \n\nWhen you search up RF power amps into amazon, dozens upon dozens of books come up. It's really overwhelming. \n\nI'm looking for an intermediate level book, like what you'd read after your intro RF class. I'm not totally against learning specifically about III-V or SiGe and just looking at HBTs since I know that's more modern but hell I'd be happy to look at CMOS based power amplifiers as well. Ideally I'd like to look at example circuits and solved problems around HBTs and HEMTs, and more of the circuit side of using them vs. the device details. \n\nIdeally it'd be nice if I could sim them in NI AWR. Having S-Param data would be really helpful to that end, if Spice models like what EKV?? Aren't available. \n\n\nAlso I liked Razavi's three-ish chapters on wireless systems review. I never took the wireless comm class in college since all I heard about it was signal processing + probability = suck. But I'd like maybe a touch more info that what razavi has given. Is there like a good RF Systems textbook that doesn't go ultra theory heavy? Like one that maybe  incorporate some circuit details but goes more into link budget analysis and more simple details? Basically something easier than what a senior undergrad/first year master's student would take. But not like full on hobbyist level. Like some sinc functions here, fourier transforms there I don't mind but if it's like mathematically intensive like all \"advanced\" signal processing or communications textbooks are going into random processes and statistical signal analysis or some crazy tough shit then yo I'm out, I'm doing this for fun! \n\nIdeally besides sims I'd like to buy a few modules either from Minicircuits or XMicrowave or hell even digikey! pHEMTs and HBTs aren't really that expensive, like you can get a bunch for like $1 per transistor. \n\nAlso, doing copper clad fab is starting to get kinda annoying and I have a job so I feel like I can spring more money for hobbies now. Any place that you don't need to sell a kidney to get some Rogers or Duroid type pcbs? I mean I guess FR4 is fine for the frequency ranges I'm working at honestly but Rogers is always the go too 1GHz+ so I wanted to see what all this dielectric hype is about. \n\n",
