Transhumanist ideas will become more visible to the world, too.\n\nMore people will realize that us humans can be so much more, with radical healthy life extension for example.\n\nThe biggest issue is that discussion of any given subject or link is being split between two subreddits and even if you subscribe to both communities you'll have to read both separate threads to see unique comments.\n\nNot to mention all of the discussions that can't happen because posters are less likely to encounter a post that inspires them to reply. \n\nTranshumanism will be more powerful as a movement with a subreddit with  32,000 - 35,000 subscribers instead of 2 separated communities with 18,000 each.\n\nHow can we do the merge this month?",

        "text": "In conversations about biotechnology, many people talk about \"taking control of our own evolution,\" and not just transhumanists. But I just can't see how this is coherent. Let me explain, and please respond if you think I'm missing something. \n\nThing is, if we're making changes to ourselves, then we are doing so on the basis of what exists already, not what will exist. And at some point, that thing that we become will be something we couldn't even have comprehended before. So in what way can we say that we are in control? How can we say that we rationally decided the direction that our technical modifications could take us in? It seems more like we are \"going along for the ride\" with technology/nature. \n\nDoes this make sense, or should I elaborate?\n\n**EDIT:** Here's perhaps a helpful elaboration. Ignore it if it's confusing: \n\n*A* can imagine modifying himself so that he is *AB*. But once he is *AB*, he finds that he can imagine things up to *D* when before he could only see things up to *C*. Moreover, *AB* now finds that he senses a lot of sadness that he previously couldn't, and that's something he never could have guessed as *A*. So now, he decides to escape that sadness and modify himself to be *ABD*. How can we say that *A* took hold of his own evolution to become *ABD*? \n\nAlso, how can we say that *A* improved nature when the source of his desires at least to become *AB* were _from_ nature? How can this be \"progress\" except in a retrospective sense? ",

        "text": "An artificial intelligence would be able to easily switch from vessel to vessel. It would be able to inhabit virtual reality (the internet, for instance), the physical world which we inhabit through various \"avatars\", and planes of existence that we are unaware of at this time. The forms may be human, they may not be (if you have the proper propioceptive programs for them and the cognitive software can be retained, it should be no problem). It would also feasibly be able to inhabit them all simultaneously. I know it's all theory at this point, but is it possible to transfer the consciousness of, let's say myself, to a inorganic/nonbiological medium and still retain my self-awareness? Or would I merely die in the process only to be replaced by a very convincing nonbiological entity?\nA reasonable solution to this might be the oft mentioned gradual replacement of neurons with inorganic equivalents. However, in the end, is this achieving a goal any different from direct mind uploading? Is it possible to transfer what we call \"consciousness\" from an organic substrate to an inorganic one? What are your thoughts?",
