I just want clarification cause i remember this being a talking point.",

        "text": "I know it's pretty obvious that the three are in positions which are pretty end game wow factor.\n\nLuffy is in pretty much a leveled up version of sabondy, which he got bodied by sentoumaru, let alone Kizaru\n\nLaw is in a situation like Luffy's initial sabondy, where he is in a bad way and is just trying to escape with his kidney attached, facing Blackbeard and crew. He is on the backfoot and while doing A LOT better than Luffy did pre skip in sabondy relative to his opponent, he still is just thinking about survival.\n\nKid meanwhile is &gt;!facing Shanks, someone who he didn't quite even make it to previously, but now he's back, paralleling Luffy's situation with sabondy 2.0, this is Kid's Sabondy 2.0.!&lt; Kid upon going into the new world early into the timeskip, wanted to one up Luffy, him facing the Red Hairs Pirates (not even Shanks), was his \"I got my ass beat, I need to sit back, re-access, and get stronger\". He then eventually more recently with luffy coming back pretty much lined up perfectly with going into big mom territory, crushing snack, and taking a rubbing before leaving. Since then he's got defeated by Kaidou (which worth noting that Kid's first fight vs kaidou was more competitive than Luffy's first match based on hawkins statements, albeit he still was crushed), went into prison, trained up and got an overall boost like Luffy did, then he went on to have a huge list of fights at onigashima, giving him further anime power ups. Of course this is anime, when you push yourself, you come out stronger at the end, this means that the Kid who fought Big Mom wasn't the Kid who healed afterwards, and he was already nerfed in that fight cuz hawkins bs from another side of the island. Kid at this point is VERY aware of what a yonkou can do, so that brings up to where we are. Kid is going into the situation fully confident, despite knowing full well how strong yonkou are, heck, he fought the strongest 2 just last arc. Yes, he'll have stronger haki, probably can use his awakening more, stronger stats, but he knows how strong a yonkou is, so there has to be more. He also was clearly shown multiple demonstrations of haoshoku coating, and I think that's another tool Kid now has in his upcoming fight. So Kid is going into the shanks fights with haoshoku coating, more mass spam of awakening, increased stats even though he was already a powerful and tanky asf person, etc. His confidence isn't without merit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what does this mean? I think that what happens with Luffy's situation will be a replica of what happens with Kid's situation, if Luffy beats Kizaru, the stronger pacifista, etc, then I believe Kid will beat Shanks, but in the worst scenario, both will just be able to escape, the parallel between them is too big. Meanwhile with Law, I believe Garp showing up will parallel Rayleigh showing up, in that Garp going there will be why Law can get off scott free, of course law is light years closer to blackbeard than luffy was to even sentoumaru pre skip, but the parallel is there. This isn't the sabondy in that law will get his revenge down the line, it's the sabondy in that outside interference will help him, while Luffy/Kid's fate will be shared with their respective opponents in their sabondy 2.0's.",

Most likely it’ll never happen but Chopper would make a great Rokushiki master if he combined it with his different points. This is just be spit balling but I came up with these:\n\nHeavy point + Tekkai = Iron gong\n\nGuard point + Tekkai = Iron ball \n\nArm point + Finger pistol = Roseo metal gattling \n\nWalk point + Geppo = Geppo (Think back to how he looked when bringing doctorine down the mountain)\n\nJumping point + Shave = Shave but with double the speed \n\nHorn point + shave + Tekkai = Horn bullet \n\nI don’t think chopper has used any kick attacks so the tempest kick might be useless to him. As for the six king gun, I guess that it would be used best in heavy point. I don’t think monster point benefits much from any of these except Tekkai and maybe Geppo.",

He's already demonstrated this arc that he has a benevolent dream (to share his knowledge with the world), he has given the Strawhats information, and in the chapter I screenshotted above he helped preserve the knowledge of Ohara. I do believe that, in his past, he was a hero. But the trouble is, Vegapunk is no longer entirely himself. Enter, the satellites:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ch. 1067](https://preview.redd.it/x77yrm5wqtka1.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=97fdcf7e732a05c5e21ff57249aae5d817aa368d)\n\nVegapunk has separated all parts of himself that make him human. We know that desire (alternatively translated as \"greed\") is what keeps a person moving forward, as demonstrated by the drawings of poorly aged Strawhats if they give up their dreams. Wrath, while not a positive emotion, is certainly human to feel, and Vegapunk has isolated that part of himself. And one last thing that readers of the TCB scans may miss is that the alternative translation for Shaka's aspect is \"good\". Vegapunk has quite literally removed the part of him that is good.\n\n\"But what about evil?\" I hear you ask. He has separated the evil from himself as well, that I cannot dispute. But I don't think that Vegapunk is evil. I think it's worse. Vegapunk is ***nothing***. He is a shell of his former self which only exists to serve the World Government, *just like Kuma*.\n\nWhy did the Stella suddenly disappear in the middle of the battle?\n\nWhy didn't the Stella call off the Seraphim immediately?\n\nWhy did the Stella use such obvious reverse psychology on Bonney?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ch. 1072](https://preview.redd.it/ahxgru77stka1.png?width=342&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bb017d2dcd1080f7f488f90ccd60cd46fd7e4bea)\n\nHe's playing everyone. Like Kuma, there's even perhaps a part of Vegapunk that knew this would happen, and he specifically set up Shaka and the others to carry on his legacy. But the true Vegapunk, supposedly a kind fellow?\n\nHe is simply not there.",

        "text": " (TL:DR provided at the end)\n\nSo! After 1.5 months of intense bingeing, I have finished reading One Piece up to the most recent chapter, and when I started I decided to run a little experiment. I hope you will all accept my first post in this sub!\n\nI read a lot of books on my eReader which helpfully gives me the amount of time I have spent on completing each book. I thought that by comparing my natural reading speed of traditional novels, I can use that to find approximately how long One Piece is in terms of word count. All other word count estimates I've found online take a literal approach - counting the words on the page - a method I don't enjoy. It both severely under and overestimates the actual length due to the nature of OP being a comic. When people search for the \"word count\" of a certain series, they really want to know **how long it will take them to finish compared to other books.**\n\nThis experiment attempts to find how many words One Piece feels to read. It is NOT a count of how many words are actually in the entire manga. \n\n# Method &amp; findings\n\nAs established, I am well aware of my own natural reading speed, which we will express in words per minute (WPM). Here are some examples using a few well-known books:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8scap880rska1.png?width=716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4da68fbb922920028888ff65bbe3922d75910ff5\n\nFrom here we can determine my average (comfortable) reading speed is 333 WPM or 20k/hr. \n\nGathering data for my time reading One Piece was a bit more difficult as my eReader does not support manga, so I read on my phone which does not track my reading time. Instead, I took 10 trials of the # of chapters I can read in 2 hours. \n\n \n\n[Each trial took 2 hours, I noted down the # of chapters I was able to cover in that time](https://preview.redd.it/rqb2m9m4rska1.png?width=328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0c71eacbe026a4ebc9ae53e54929b330f1cb166c)\n\nOn average, I take 5 minutes to finish one chapter of OP. As we can see, this time varies depending on which arc I’m on (pretty sure I finished the entirety of Marineford in an hour). Still, it’s a good enough approximation.\n\nNow let’s apply the two to get an estimate of how many words one chapter of One Piece feels like to read. \n\n333 x 5 = **1665**\n\nIf we multiply that by the current number of chapters (1076), we can find how long the entire series would be in terms of word count.\n\n1665 x 1076 = **1,791,540**\n\n# Disclaimers\n\nReading speed varies for everyone and every series. The fact that I read the entire manga on my phone meant I was squinting and zooming in whenever the page gets busy, which definitely affected my speed. People also consume art differently as well. Some might pause to take in a particularly important/detailed panel, while others speed on by to hunt for the next text box. What I mean to say is my numbers **should not be applied to any other series**. It also may not reflect your own experience with the series at all, I just wanted to see how long this amazing series felt to me if measured like a traditional novel.\n\nThis experiment is flawed and highly depends on my own manga-to-novel reading speed ratio, but I hope my findings can be useful when convincing others to start the series!\n\n# TL;DR – Conclusion\n\nBy my estimate, up to chapter 1076, One Piece would be **1,791,540** words long in terms of reading time. To put that number into perspective, the entire LOTR series is 576,459 words long and the Game of Thrones series has 1,348,000 words.\n\nOf course, since One Piece IS a comic, I am in no way implying that OP only contains as much story as a 1.7M book, only that it took me the same amount of time to finish as I would a book of that size.\n\nHope this was interesting! I've been avoiding the OP fandom for the past month and a half while reading to hide from spoilers, so I look forward to my time here!!",

        "text": "I think the only straw hats that will get haki, apart from those who already have it, are Usopp, Nami, and Robin.\n\nUsopp already showed observation haki in dressrosa, so we know for a fact he has haki potential. However at the moment, it doesn't seem like he knows how to use it. Chances are, he will learn in Elbaf.\n\nSimilarly for Nami, Jinbe made a comment about her seeming to have conqueror's haki. While this was obviously a joke, I do think it could be a hint that she will obtain haki at some point(albeit not necessarily conqueror's). She is a non-DF user and hence, haki is the most logical power up for her. Especially in the later battles.\n\nLastly for Robin, she trained with the revolutionaries over the timeskip. People like Sabo, Hack, Koala, maybe even Dragon for all we know. We know those characters have haki, so I think its possible that Robin, while not having haki at the moment, knows enough about haki to acquire it in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think the other haki-less straw hats will get other power ups. I think Brook and Chopper will get awakening. Their power ups have always been connected to their DFs. With chopper manipulating his DF with drugs and brook learning to better master it over the timeskip. I think Chopper's awakening will make him look near human, while still retaining some minor reindeer features. This form should have the cloud cloak we see on Luffy's awakening as well as Lucci and Kaku's, differentiating it from Chopper's other forms like monster point. \n\nBrook's awakening will probably allow him to extend his powers to his surroundings and summon the souls of the damned or something, like Dr Strange did in multiverse of madness.\n\nLastly for Franky, his future powers are probably going to be science related. He'll upgrade his laser beams or maybe even learn to produce Vegapunk's green blood and utilize artificial DF powers.",

It will involve current manga content, so please stop here if you don‘t want to get spoiled.\n\nSo I thought about some mysteries, that still need to be unraveled. You all remember those giant pillars in the Florian Triangle? That Oda referred to just once while they appeared? They seemed to be the reason ships disappered long before Moria was there. An horror far older and absolutely massive in size, shrouded in fog. Only 2 eyes or lights seemed to glow up.\n\nNow I thought: why even introduce them and not reference them once? This is clearly a mystery Oda set up for later and that there were no hints until now seems weird. If after all this time, it would be revealed it was just a big monster doesn‘t seem impressive. We saw like half a dozen sea kings that were almost half the size of fishman island and Zunesha is like ridiculously big. \nSo what if it is not a creature, but a floating fortress from the Void Century and the eyes were just lights? People could still live there, unseen by the Government. And this would also explain why it didn‘t mess with Thriller Bark all the time. They didn‘t want to fight, but hide. And sometimes ships just „disappear“, because some of their own returned from an expedition or a scouting mission. Would be a really interesting twist I think that could tie into the endgame. \n\nOr, like I said, I‘m just going nuts and it‘s just Zunesha going for a stroll. Still, hope at least someone had a funny minute with this.",

        "text": "One of the One Piece mysteries few people talk about it:\n\nThe EMERALD CITY\n\nIn the manga during the Jaya Arc, when Luffy meets Bellamy, the latter talks about the death of the era of the Pirates dreamers and pinpoints three mythical places in the OP World that adventurers from all the world are trying to reach that simply don't exist.\n\n1. The City of Gold (The Strawhats found it in Skypeia)\n\n2. The Emerald City\n\n3. The One Piece (Supposedly in the mythical unreachable island of Laughtale)\n\nThe most overlooked one among these three though, is the Emerald City, Bellamy doesn't even mention it in the anime, but it makes me think, will the Strawhats come across to all those three places??\n\nDoes the Emerald City really exist?\n\nWill it come back in the main story or it's just an aborted plotline for which Oda had plans but then decided to scrap entirely?\n\nI originally thought that this legendary city would be found in a secret zone in Vegapunk's Island.\n\nBut now in the manga we are at Egghead, and i have this feeling that it won't be the island or arc in which such thing will be discovered, i don't think adventure and the discovery of an unknown place will be the center of this specific arc.\n\nSo i think that the Emerald City is actually located somewhere in an unknown and secret land at ELBAF.\n\nIt may even be in a Sky Island, at the top of that absurdly gigantic tree called \"Adam\" that's been teased for so long.\n\nI have this feeling that Elbaf will be the New World version of the Skypeia Arc, but even bigger, better, and more mindblowing in terms of mystery, adventures, and earth shattering discoveries.\n\nElbaf will probably be the arc of the \"pure adventure and mysteries\", and which better island where to unravel this mystery and discover this unknown city??\n\nThoughts?\n\nWhat do you think about this theory?\n\nWhere do you think this city is?",

So this idea don’t the most creative but I think buggy’s devil fruit plus rokushiki/6 powers would be pretty strong. Most people who learned rokushiki get pretty strong bc it but I feel like rokushiki+the chop chop fruit would be a different level. For instance finger pistol could be a lot more deadly because he could just launch all his fingers and probably do it in a way where it’s hard to dodge ig. Tempest kick would become much more unavoidable. Shave would also be easy because of the use is all split up it’s much harder to hit plus shave. The six king gun could be a little sneakier. And also if buggy had iron body luffy wouldn’t have been able to stop him with a kick to the balls. Basically rokushiki plus buggy plus Haki=An op way to use the chop chop fruit. What do you guys on this subreddit think?",

Thats simple teach is always transformed 24/7 darkness or the void is not a real creature just pure chaos/darkness which makes sense of why its a zoan but has the propraties of logia like devil fruit and let me tell u theres somethin called a black dwarf star sounds familiar? İts beacuse one of teaches attacks is called black star  and now let me explain how öne forms\n\nAt the end of a black dwarf's life, the onetime star will experience proton decay and eventually evaporate into an exotic form of hydrogen. Two white dwarfs discovered in 2012 are a little past 11 billion years old—meaning they could be on their way toward black dwarf transformation\nAnd heres the explanation of how the universe will end \n\nİn the unimaginably far future, cold stellar remnants known as black dwarfs will begin to explode in a spectacular series of supernovae, providing the final fireworks of all time. That's the conclusion of a new study, which posits that the universe will experience one last hurrah before everything goes dark forever.\n\nAnd i personally imagine that the current one piece universe will die by black beard and luffy would loose but after that a new one will be given birth to it could be similar to the old one piece world or with out most of the fruits and there might be only 1 fruit left standing the yami yami no mi where it would be like how demon slayer showed the characters decandents instead we will see modern era versions of the straw hats remember oda did reveal which country they would be from and who will be the father, mother,children etc\nSo i highly believe that is what we will see a big twist from oda but he might give us a look to an alternate time line where luffy won and he had kids and his crew got kids too and their kids going on their own journey or the in the rebirthed modern era that devil fruits are starting to appear or some of you would like to say re appear and we see modern era luffy about to eat a mysterious fruit then a cliff hanger",

        "text": "I don't know if it was ever mentioned or posted before, but I believe I know where the last phoneglyph is.\nI obviously don't have proof, but some things seem to make a lot of sense if this happens to be the case.\n\nI believe that Shanks has the last Phoneglyph. Specifically the one that used to reside on Fishman Island.\nReasons I believe this might be the case are as following:\n\n- Shanks knew where all of the phoneglyphs were, because he was with Gol D Roger.\n- He could have gotten the scar over his eye from Blackbeard while he was still with the WB Pirates that were protecting his turf. Yet he would've still gotten away with it.\n\nWhy would he want just one Phoneglyph? I believe he didn't. I think wanted to go after the One Piece earlier, but something, or rather someone, got in the way of his plans. He stole the Hito Hito no Mi: Model Nika but we don't know why. Shanks might believe you needed it in some way to become the Pirate King. But, our boy Luffy ate it and got in his way.\n\nI think he changed his plans as soon as that happened. He had the one Phoneglyph already, so when Luffy ate the Hito Hito no Mi: Model Nika, he decided to help him become the Pirate King.\n\nHe is guarding that last Phoneglyph from everyone besides Luffy. This would explain the following things:\n\n- Why he says to Luffy that he can return the Straw Hat when they meet again, he already knew that that was gonna be when he had all other 3 Phoneglyphs already. This would mean that the final fight was always meant to be between Luffy and Shanks. Shanks' reasoning for this would simply be, that he wanted to test if Luffy could make good on his word on becoming the strongest and if he can beat him, he would give him the last Phoneglyph and he could return the Strawhat, because he wouldnt have a need for it anymore.\n- This would explain why Shanks was \"allowed\" to have an audience with the Gorosei. Shanks protecting the last Phoneglyph lines up with the World Governments interests. No-one would be able to reach Laughtale as long as Shanks was protecting it. And since they cant be destroyed and the World Government knows it is with Shanks, it wouldn't matter to them that he has it. He poses no threat to them.\n- This would also explain why Shanks seemingly never does anything throughout the series. Because he only has to protect the Phoneglyph. To me, he only does something, when it protects the outcome of Luffy becoming stronger and thus the Pirate King (Marineford for example, it would be necessary for Ace to die and Kaido to stay away, so Luffy had a reason to become stronger)\n\nNow, in the latest chapter Vegapunk mentions his Phoneglyph research got leaked to the World Government. This, in my opinion can be two things:\nHow to destroy them or how to translate them. Both of these things would pose a threat to the stance Shanks had taken on protecting the Poneglyph. Because, if they could now be translated by everyone, everyone that reads it would form a threat to the World Government. The same goes for a way to destroy them, Shanks would then form a threat to them, since they know he has a Phoneglyph.\nThis could be the reason that Shanks suddenly decides to go for the One Piece. Because he also knows/found out that Vegapunks research leaked to the World Government and it would open up the possibility that if the World Government succeeds in destroying a Phoneglyph, no one would ever be able to go to Laughtale anymore. So in his eyes, he is gonna have to do it himself to expose the World Government.\n\nThere might be a lot of things I'm missing, but I honestly believe that this might turnout to be true. It would be very \"Oda-like\" to have Shanks be Luffy's last fight and telling him: I've been waiting for you Luffy and telling him he always believed in him. It would be heart-felled especially because he has always been a father figure to him.",

        "text": "So i finally started watching one piece and i have to say the session lengths are insane session 4 is over 100 episodes. I noticed a few things  \n\n\n  \n1. Why does Zoro loose direction all the time now in session 1 and two it was fine but suddenly in session 3 they deleted his sense of orientation from the face of the earth. I remember during the episode where they thought against the black cat pirates zoro found back to the beach immediately and Ruffy was the one who got lost.  \n\n\n2. Is it just me or are half the sessions just flashbacks they just pad the run time of already over the top session lengths.  \n\n\n3. It felt to me like there was a noticeable drop in quality from sky island to session 4 the foxy pirates are just boring.  \n\n\n4. Why is it that everybody uses the last part of the name and not the first is this a Japanese thing?",
