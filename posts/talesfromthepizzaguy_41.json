I see an older gentleman in the back of the house with no shirt on and only boxers. The lady who answered the door was apparently wearing the old man's wife beater shirt and nothing else. Her old saggy boobs were hanging out of each side of the shirt, since it was so big on her. I don't know if it was a thrill thing for them, or they were just old and don't care about anything anymore.

I told the driver it was all good and to just hand it to me, to which he ignored and then continued to open my wing box to show me my food. I kind of snapped at the guy(which I hate doing anyway because I know what that feels like) and said \"just give me my food dude\" and didn't tip.\n\nIs the open-the-box thing normal? My friend that I was with said she thought it was weird and had never seen that before, same as I. I feel like a jerk for snapping at the guy but at the same time I'm like \"I don't need to see my food I know what I ordered, plus I'm sure your hands are sparkling clean\". \n\nHelp me, /r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy.",

        "text": "The UK is not exactly a tipping culture, but my parents almost always leave a tip after a meal at a restaurant, or when a service like hairdressing is performed.  However, whenever they left me and my brother money for pizza they never said anything about tips and would usually just leave us the correct amount to pay the delivery boy.  I can't recall ever giving one a tip when ordering with my own money either.\n\nConsidering that the UK is different to the US, is tipping expected when it comes to pizza delivery?  I honestly don't know, and I kinda feel bad thinking about the number of times I've ordered pizza without giving the guy a tip.  Can someone advise me on this?",

        "text": "I worked for a pizza delivery place in a small town, and this has to be one to the strangest things that has ever happened to me.\n\nWe get a call in from an out-of-state number, which is fairly typical as it is a college town. The man on the other line places his order, normal, normal, and then asks to pay over the phone with a credit card. Cool, we do that. After I run his card I ask if he wants to leave a tip. This is where it gets a little strange.The man offers me a VERY generous tip, with a few conditions.\n\nHe explains that he does not live at this address, or state and lives very far away. He has been dating the woman who does live there though for a long time. Over the internet.  \n\nRiiiight. I can kinda see where this is going. He says that he'd give me a generous tip ( like 40$ on a 16$ pizza) if he could call back later and have me describe the woman who answers the door, and conform her name. Heck yes! I'm poor and all I have to do is give \"free\" pizza and take down a description and she lives really close by? I put the order in, finish the charge on the card, with the tip, and get ready to head out.\n\nI reach the place, it's a dump. Like should be condemned dump. I knock on the door and a very, very, VERY large 35 year old or something answers the door. I can see/hear three children behind her. She doesn't see surprised to see me, and smiles a gin with missing teeth. She takes the pizza and checks to make sure it's already paid for. I say yes, ask her name and leave.\n\nAbout 30mins later, the guy calls back. I tell him the name and who I saw and he sounds very upset. I'm guessing this is not how she'd been portraying her self online. Anyways the guy never called back again, and she probably got dumped for being a lair McLairface. I feel good for helping the guy out and I made 40$. Win-win but still strange.\n\nIs this common? I didn't deliver pizzas for long but this seems like a genius idea on the guys part. I would have never thought of it!\n\nTLDR: Guy sends a pizza to online girlfriend he'd never met, she's a cow with loud kids, I made 40$ and probably saved this guy some grief. ",

        "text": "I had only been working for a week or so when this happened.\n\nThis lady walked into our store one afternoon and asked if she could put in a delivery for several hours later. She said it was for a relative's quincaenera (basically the Hispanic version of Sweet Sixteen) and she wanted to order ~7 pizzas to be delivered to a banquet hall.\n\nWhen we take an order in-person, it doesn't require a phone number. Stupidly, I didn't think to ask for a number and just took the order. She asked me to place it for 7 PM, paid in cash, and left.\n\nWhen 6:30PM rolled around, I was getting ready to leave work when my manager came up and asked if I took the quincaenera order. I cautiously said yes, knowing that something probably went wrong if my manager was asking me about a specific order.\n\nBasically, I fucked up. The address for the banquet hall was very much out of our range. The woman had paid in cash and, because my dumb ass didn't think to get her phone number, we couldn't contact her. \n\nMy shift ended very soon after, so I didn't get to see what happened. I asked a coworker the next day, but she didn't know what I was talking about. Two other coworkers didn't know either, as if the order never even happened in the first place. I never found out what happened to it. For all I know, one of the drivers took the order despite it being out of range - but it's the \"not knowing\" that kills me. \n\nThat order haunts me. I can't help picturing a 15-year-old girl in her frilly dress, crying because \"WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN ON MY SPECIAL DAY\". A father consoling his daughter when tradition says he should be dancing with her instead. A small banquet hall full of hungry guests wondering why the food hasn't arrived. Guests going from annoyed to a hangry, burning makeshift effigies of the party planners and burning down the banquet hall in revolt. The owners of the banquet hall watching their source of income go down in flames and being forced to go on welfare.\n\nTo that 15-year-old girl, I'm sorry I messed up your quincaenera. I feel especially bad because your mom (I'm assuming it was your mom) was really nice and she even tipped me. I'm reminded of you whenever I take an in-person order for a delivery. I hope you had fun at your quincaenera, pizza or no pizza...",

        "text": "Last year during the summer break between high school and college, I drove for an overworked shop in my home town of about 20,000. As for pizza, we were the only one in our chain and regularly competed with another big chain and a local place that didn't deliver, so there were only two options for pizza. What I'm trying to get at is that I was basically in and out all the time with about 5 or 6 other drivers, so I barely remember any deliveries that would usually be worth remembering. There was the general mundane bullshit that I definitely remember, like that one gated apartment complex that always changes the code or that super rich place that always tipped $20, but that's pretty generic. However, my pizza driving companions, there is always one delivery that I will never forget for the rest of my days.\n\nUsually, I'd close up with another driver or two at around 10 or 11 after the dinner rush was over, so it was always great to get that last delivery in to avoid having to do dishes or mop the floor. I was super excited when I was up and some guy orders about 5 minutes before we closed. Usually, that would piss off a driver, but it was my first couple of months and I hadn't become all too jaded or weathered yet. So I bag the pizza and bottle of coke and head off to a decent row of duplexes by our high school. That place and the apartment complex next door was notorious for being a huge pot haven, but up until that day I hadn't seen anything too extraordinary.\n\nOnce I pulled up to this place, I realize that I had delivered to this guy once before and he seemed like a really cool dude. He tipped me pretty nice (about 6 or 7 bucks each time) and liked to do some small talk, so I was hoping to kill a few minutes before having to head back to do more dishes. I'm walking up to the door, and I smell something really weird. Like, a smelly smell that I shouldn't take to kindly, but really liked at the same time. It wasn't until I smoked for the first time a few months later that I realized there was a dank-ass musk emanating from the cracks, holes, and the chimney of this beautiful little duplex. However, my straight-edge unsuspecting ass didn't know any better at the time, and I just kind of stood there perplexed and wondering what was going on in that apartment. At the same time, there was a bright blue-white light piercing through the blackout curtains in the bay window at the front of the duplex. It seemed kind of odd, that it was just constantly that color and not flickering like the light cast from a TV playing a movie or a show normally would.\n\nI shrugged it off and walked up a flight of steps to knock on the front door. Little did I know, something magical was about to happen (keep in mind that all the events that are about to unfold just happened in just a brief moment). In a deep, mellow voice cried out \"Just a second, man, I'll be right there.\" A second passed, then another, and then yet another. Suddenly, the brass doorknob of that jet-black front door slowly turned, and for some reason the theme song to 2001: A Space Oddesy began to play in my head when the knob clicked open. Like the door to an ominous spaceship, the door slowly cracked open and a pillar of piercing blue light shone through. At the first \"dun-dunnn\" and cool drum thing, I looked down and saw a cloud of white smoke begin to pour out of the door and down the front steps. Upon the second \"dun-dunnnn\", my eyes were struggling to adjust with the blinding light. I began to see the figure and silhouette of a man whom I had seen before, but hadn't actually *seen* before. At the third and final \"dun-dunnn\", the door was completely open. A blanket of pillow-y white smoke covered the floor of his living room, and in my presence stood a tall man with flowing hair, a well-groomed goatee, and the contended grin only a stoner like him could pull off. It was at that moment that I realized I was standing in the presence of a perfect replica of Jeff Bridges. In the blinding light, in that very moment in time and space, I was fully convinced I had witnessed a miracle.\n\nBut no, it was just that same dude. The blinding light and cloud of smoke disoriented me, and the content doppelganger - who, if you didn't catch on by now, was high as *fuuck* - greeted me at the door. We chatted a bit, asking me how my day was and acting like there wasn't even a cascade of weed smoke going out of his front door. He went back to the kitchen to get the money, and I realized that the beam of light was coming from some weird 80's music video. It looked a lot like Sledgehammer from Peter Gabriel, but wasn't. He grabbed the cash, and exchanged it for what could only in his mind be the solution to all the world's problems - a beautiful medium cheese pizza and a Coke to satisfy the grandest of munchies. After the exchange, he told me \"good night, little man\" and closed the door. This enlightening experience will forever be ingrained in my memory, and I will cherish it as the best deliver I have ever made in my entire life.",

We'd drive about a mile to get to his house, but when we got there it was like christmas morning.\n\nHis mansion was very modern and looked to be 5 floors tall. You'd walk up to his spiked gate near the entrance and press one of those voice machines. \"Who is it?\" would call a voice from the other end. \"Uh...I'm here with your pizza\" you'd reply, unable to contain yourself.\n\nThe gate would open and you'd stride across the smooth marble tiles to his front door, which was probably worth more than you.\nHe'd swing the door open and you'd give him his 20 pizzas.\nAnd in return, you'd get about 200 average in tips.\n\nEvery. Fucking. Time.\n\nWe all called him \"Mr Money\" and our boss would make sure it was a different guy going each time, to make the tipping fair.\n\nBut there was this one single time.\n\nThe one moment that made Mr Money our hero.\n\nOne of my co-pizza guys had a girlfriend with some sort of condition. I can't remember the name of it, but it had something to do with the heart.\nShe was hospitalised and he was crushed. But he kept on going because there was an option for surgery to correct it, and he was saving up bit by bit.\n\nOnly problem was that the surgery cost around 10 or 20 grand.\nAnd pizza guys aren't known for being paid well.\nIt was around May and he had an order from Mr Money. The guy, who I'm calling \"Bob\" from now on, slouched towards the pizza van and slumped in. He started the ignition and sputtered off.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later and the boss recieves a call from Bob in his personal phone. It was in loudspeaker.\nBob was fucking crying. Blubbering like a baby.\n\nBut these were not tears of sadness. No no no. He was crying out of happiness.\n\nMr Money, that fucking legend, saw that Bob was sad and asked why. When he told him about the condition and surgery, he gave him the **REQUIRED MONEY FOR THE SURGERY IN CHEQUE**\n\nAlmost everyone was touched deeply. The fact that someone cared that deeply about goddamm pizza guys of all people was absolutely amazing.\n\nI met up with him 2 years later in a fancy bar. He recognized me, we talked a little and eventually I asked him why he tipped us so much.\n\nHis answer?\n\n***HIS FUCKING ANSWER?!***\n\n\"I liked the pizza.\"\n\nMr Money, I don't know where you are, but if you're reading this then I'd like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for all you did.",

Well I deliver the pizza and head back to the store, and hour goes by and we get a call complaining that their pizza was cold.

He owns his own shop with civil war memorabilia which is also locally infamous, http://www.wildmans-shop.com this is it's website. He has a full kkk uniform on display and takes pictures of everyone who isn't white that walks into his store and posts them on the wall. He also was affiliated with making the law in Kennesaw that requires everyone to own a gun. He is batshit. \n\n\nHis house is off a main road and is surrounded by woods, there is a gate on his driveway that is almost always closed that has signs on it like \"that red dot on your chest isn't a mosquito bite\" and \"shoot first, ask questions later\". \n\nI work at a Chinese restaurant very close to where he lives and it was a rainy night so waiting outside people's houses is a royal pain in the ass. \n\nOn to the story:\n\nI get a delivery on the road that his house is on so I get in my jeep and start heading there. My GPS takes me to his house so I thought it was a mistake (which it was) but his gate was open which it usually never is. So I thought \"huh, maybe Wildman wants to expand his culinary cultural horizons\" so I pull up into his driveway which is about a quarter mile long with a ditch and trees along side it and get out. \n\nI go up to his front door and notice that there are two cameras and four flood lights above it. I knock and get no answer I do this for about five minutes, knocking periodically. It's raining and I'm very wet and annoyed at this point. After those five minutes of knocking he flickers on and off his flood lights. I didn't know what that meant and it annoyed me because he didn't come to the door. I keep knocking and he does it again. \n\nThis really pissed me off and I'm soaking at this point so I knock louder and stand there. I hear his door handle jiggle and see it open. He cracks the door and the first thing I see is a pistol just staring me in the face. \n\nAlready knowing the answer, I ask him \"did you order Chinese food?\" \n\n\"no\"\n\n\"oh, sorry, my bad\"\n\nThen he said something else but I didn't stay and listen to him. I was speed walking to my car. I got into it and tore down that skinny driveway like I was Mario Andretti. \n\nThe strange thing is is that I wasn't scared, I was mad. I was thinking \"how dare he pull a gun in me?\"",

Suddenly a crazy eyed old man appeared from behind a stack of pizza boxes. He kinda looked like [this](http://comps.canstockphoto.com/can-stock-photo_csp15296359.jpg). He power walked towards me with his hand outretched. \n\n\"HI! I'm Paul and I'm the most motivated person you've ever met! I folded up all of these boxes in 20-- NO! 18 minutes!!!\" \n\nI was not impressed. In fact, I immediately hated this fucking guy. Paul continued to tell me of his vast accomplishments in pizza as I kept my head down and continued scraping. The guy had brought his own fucking pizza bag with his name sewn on it and he drove a lime green smart car. He was extremely hyper and he giggled like a child almost constantly. Paul had to be at least 50-60 years old. Keep in mind, none of the employees know who the hell this guy is. The manager just brought him in without telling anybody. So we all try our best to work around Paul and his shenanigans, later I figure out that he is some sort of business consultant and he 'owns' several franchises up north.\n\nAfter I clocked out that night I went out back to have a smoke. I heard Paul and one of his goons having a heated conversation behind the dumpster. Apparently Paul was trying to screw my boss over and take 50% ownership of the franchise in exchange for his 'help'. I finished my shift the next day and told my boss to call me when Paul leaves because I will not work with him. I told him about the conversation I heard and got the hell out of there. He called me 2 days later and I went back to work again.\n\nMy run in with Paul made me seriously think about my choices in life. That is a man who has spent his entire life as a pizza boy. Now he is a man consumed by greed and motivated by mozzarella. Kids, don't grow up to be like Paul.\n\n\nTL;DR - A crazy old manchild with his own personalized pizza bag tried to scam my boss",

        "text": "TL;DR \"x mayo\" mean 'extra mayo' not 'no mayo'  \n\nI deliver around my college campus, which isn't bad because students are always extremely appreciative for food, and, shockingly enough, they tip pretty reasonably. However, lunches during the week are almost exclusively to the university hospital which is a huge pain. They all request we wait outside an entrance that we're not allowed into, plus they request a call and almost always make you wait, even if it's pouring down rain. I would stay in my car, but I have to get out and walk around a corner through a courtyard to get to the entrance. Side note: doctors and nurses tip much worse than college kids and are generally pretty prickly.   \nAnyway one lady ordered a sub with extra mayo. The way our store rings it up, the receipt says \"Sub #1, x mayo\" for extra mayo. Well she took this to mean no mayo, and barks at me for screwing up her order. I interrupted her to tell her not only did I not make the sandwich, but I also didn't even take her order. Then I looked at her receipt, laughed to myself and told her that the x means \"extra mayo\" not \"no mayo\". She stares at it for a second, says \"oh\", then signs the receipt and walks back into the building without another word. I looked at the receipt and only after she had disappeared back into the hospital did I realize that she had just stiffed me.",

        "text": "Posting a second story for the night, hope you don't mind.\n\nSo tonight a lady stole pizza right out of my hands. Earlier this week me, another driver, and our manager were a tad worried to leave.\n\nWe get a callfor delivery and I'm the one that answers. Things are going swell as I take her order until she informs me she has a coupon. 17.99 for a large pizza and boneless wings. This is where things go down hill really fast.\n\nI read back the order and give her the total after adding on the coupon and she ask how much it woukd be to add breadsticks. Telling her the price changed her mind and so we went back over the original price and she asks how a 17.99 coupon plus tax ends up around 27 dollars. In the middle of telling her ot was because of the delivery charge, pan crust, soda, and double sausage I realized due to my incorrect prescription glasses and tiny letters I read it wrong. As I correct myself she starts screaming that I said it was because of pan and now it's not and I'm fucking lying. Zero to 100 real fast.\n\nOver her ranting and raving while I apologize and explain the tiny letters she insists her dog can see better than I and he deserves my job more I yell \"I'm getting my manager\" and put her on hold. I explain to my manager the situation and she goes to pick up the phone and the lady hangs up....... And Immediately calls back screaming at her that I hung up on her and called her a liar when she said that she had been on hold , she even saw the mute button lit up. \n\nThen she proceeds to cuss my manager out who kindly informs her that she is now not getting an order. She calls back again the other driver answered. Same treatment and got refused service. Calls again. Other driver answers. She demands to know his full name, store and personal number and store address. \n\nShe's only getting first name and store info and he tells her to go online and do whatever she wants. I take out a delivery and she calls 5 times, always yelling. Threatens to kick the other drivers and my managers ass. I come back, take another delivery, she's called 5 more times. At least she tried to be nice a few times and tries to order carryout instead because, as she stated \"ROB won't take my delivery order so I guess I have to pick it up\"\n\nManager has already informed our RGM and she's told us not to take her order period which manager tells her this. She insists we can't do that and keeps calling us to yell, curse, and try and be nice to get an order (also says we're worthless pieces of ahit because we get paid hourly). None of which works and she is banned from ordering now forever.\n\nFinally she stops calling and I learn she does this often. Apparently she's also chased a driver out of her yard calling him a \"Fat pussy.\" a real class act there guys.\n\nHer last name was Budweiser and I remember muttering to myself in the middle of all this \".... I bet that's not even your real name you psychopath.\n\n\n\n",

In the middle of signing her name she realized there was only one pizza on there and instantly informs me it was supposed to be two as she hands the recipet back.\n\nWell, the new girl had taken it so I just figured she forgot to hit the end pizza button on the second one. So we called the store and as she's talking to my manager she reaches for the pizza and I hand it to her as I'm taking the recipet off the box. She snatches both out of my hands, informs me I am not getting the receipt till she gets her other pizza, and slams the door in my face.\n\nI imediately call the store and inform the manager that she just did that and of course asks me to knock on the door again. Meh. He said to inform her that if we didn't get the receipt she wasn't getting a second pizza.\n\nI knock and I know she hears me because I see her keep peeking through her blinds. Call the store again and we decide to call her. Manager calls back after talking to her again and tells me to knock one more time. I do and still nothing. Thank you for wasting time I could have used to be sweeping but whatever.\n\nBut that is nothing compared to the lady earlier in the week. Gonna post it on it's own since it's p long and this already decently sized.",

        "text": "TL;DR: They were doing dumb shit, endangering a child and the fuckers stiffed me. Asked for exact change back. \n\nLong Version: I get a delivery out to a particularly shitty hotel on the far side of town. It takes about 12 minutes to get there from the store, and it's a single. I'd grumble about it on that basis alone, but beyond that, I have NEVER, EVER gotten a tip from an order that went out there. Not enough to consider a tip, anyway. Usually just whatever change is left from their bottom dollar. You guys know what I mean. \n\nAt any rate, I get to this hotel, hop out of my car and make my way to the door. When I'm about ten feet away, the smell hits me. Just an overpowering amount of marijuana. Boom. In the face. \n\nNow I don't care about weed. I've partaken. I enjoy it. I still light up with friends if the chance arises. Not so much my thing anymore, but hey, you know what, you do you, man. \n\nAnyway, I get to the door and the odor is so strong that it's bringing me back to the good old days. I knock. \n\nThis enormous, fat fuck (at least 320 lbs) of a monstrosity answers the door. I say monstrosity because I wasn't sure of the gender, and Lakotan Native Americans (if it happens in any other race, I've never seen it. But we have a high native population out here and if they have this condition, they're massive alcoholics. It's like hyperpigmentation scarring on crack.) get this condition on their face when they're heavy alcoholics - these weird little nodules that look like red pancake - their face was so covered in it that it felt like I was looking at THING from Fantastic 4.\n\nBehind them, I see another monstrosity sitting at the table, rolling a joint, a couple empty bottles on the floor and table next to it. \n\nThe smoke in this room is so thick that it's hazy as fuck and there's literally smoke rolling out the door. \n\nBut like I said, you do you. \n\nAnd then, I see, poking out from behind Monstrosity #2's leg, looking at me, a cute, sweet, innocent little boy, in nothing but a diaper, running around in the smoke, swatting at it and playing with it. He picks up a beer can and shakes it. \n\nIt was that moment that I considered calling the cops. Do your thing, but don't put a fucking two year old in the middle of it. What the fuck is wrong with you?\n\nAs I very quietly read off the total and exchange pizza for money, he asks for his change back. I quickly add up in my head that it was 17 cents. I dig in my pocket, tell him I have 14 and he says \"that will have to do.\"\n\nI got in my car and instantly called the cops for a welfare check. \n\nNever did find out what happened, but I hope that kid got placed with a better family. \n\nTold my manager when I got back. \n\nHe deleted the entry from the system and told me that if they came asking for which driver had taken their order, that he'd just have to tell them that he couldn't find the information. Cool on his part. \n\nBut the whole thing just infuriated me. Worthless, lazy, disgusting lumps of flesh. \n\nBastards. I fucking hate people. \n\nEdit: For those wondering why I included the shitty tip: Just an icing on the cake bit of the story. The part that made me *feel* justified. I knew I would have been either way, and I would have called either way, but the shitty tip is just what sealed it for me in a way that I never once felt bad about it or second guessed what I'd done.\n",

        "text": "So, tonight, I had a little bit of faith restored. \n\nSimply put, I go out on a triple run, not a huge deal for most of you, but I work for a smaller company in a town of 30,000 in the middle of nowhere that has about 9 different places that deliver, and triple trips are always pretty cool for that extra few bucks. They don't happen often. And quads are unheard of (Though, as lead driver/shift leader, I sometimes give them to myself, hehe). \n\nAt any rate, as I'm pulling up to my last delivery, I check the app (FoodTec, does anyone else use this? Cool shit.) to see how they're paying and my heart sinks as I see that it's a free order. Freebies never fucking tip. Dammit. Whatever. I mark it as delivered and hop out of my car.\n\nI get to the door and a woman answers, looking rather angry. Combining the facts that this is a free order and she looks pissed, I feel that some shit is about to go down. \n\nI ask her how she's doing and she replies \"Fine. I'm fine. Are you the one that delivered it last time?\" Oh no. Fuck me. I was having such a good night, too. \n\n\"Uh, I don't believe so... Maybe? I take a lot of deliveries.\" I knew I hadn't, but I was trying to downplay whatever clusterfuck I had just walked into.\n\nShe calls her son over \"Shawn (We'll say), get over here.\" *Son wanders over. He's about seventeen, looks like a punk.* \"Is this the one that delivered it last time?\"\n\nAt this point, I'm nervous. For whatever reason, I'm about to get verbally violated by this strict looking, forty something mom. \n\n\"No mom, it's not. It was some old lady last time.\"\n\nMuch to my surpise, she smacks him in the back of the head. I have no fucking clue what's going on. \n\nAs I confusedly stare, she looks at me and apologizes. \"I told my son to tip on our last delivery, but he didn't. I'm kinda glad our pizza was messed up so someone would come back, we know it's not your fault... Now, is there any way for me to add a tip for both you and the last driver? I don't have any cash and I paid with a card.\"\n\nI stood dumbfounded for a moment before smiling and replying, telling her that as a manager, I could absolutely add a tip after the fact.\n\n\"Good! Go ahead and make sure you both get three dollars, okay? Thank you for coming back!\"\n\n\"No, thank you ma'am, most people aren't that generous or understanding.\"\n\nMade my night. ",

After the second time, he asked why it was taking so long (it had only been 4 minutes), and I told him we make all our food to order and it'd be ready in 10. Keep in mind that we weren't running late - we only had one or two orders before his, and it was going to take no more than 15 minutes for his food to be out.\n\nHe kept asking, and it got so awkward that I retreated to the cut table so I could get his food out ASAP. He moved to the front counter, and every time he made eye contact with me, he'd ask where his food was and then throw his hands up when I told him it wasn't ready. I kept telling him it was in the oven.\n\nFinally, as the wings were coming out, he walked around to the cut table to confront me directly. And he was mad.\n\nButt: Where is it?\n\nMe: I'm sorry, it should be out in a couple of minutes.\n\nButt: Give me my shit.

He hears the dispatch for a house fire to an address that is a customer of ours. After waiting a bit he looks up her information and calls her. She's upset and doesn't understand why he's calling, but he explains that he heard what happened and wants to offer dinner on us. So he makes a couple of pizzas, and I'm the driver taking it and a soda out to her. I get there and she's outside. I walk up and she's crying and shaking and whatnot. I set the pies down and we talk for about half an hour. I let her know everything is going to be okay. I just let her get everything out and I tell her that we just wanted you to worry about one less thing tonight and that's why we offered to bring you dinner. My manager gave me a tip out of his own pocket, but it wasn't necessary. I would've taken them for free. After our conversation I gave her a hug and went on my merry way. I like to think in a shitty situation, my manager made her night.",

        "text": "In the early 2000s, I delivered pizza for a living in the bustling town of Santa Rosa, California.. It was a fun job, and I lived frugally but comfortably on my tips and meager wages. I met great friends and had many adventures.\n\nOne day, and order came in from a guy who, judging by his address, lived in a not-so-great part of town. (My store was used to delivering in questionable neighborhoods, and our drivers were a careful bunch.) A large pizza and a two-liter of soda. The man had a coupon for a special we were running for just that combo. I waited for the order, packed it up, and headed out.\n\nI arrived at the man’s address and knocked on the door. A young boy - no more than six or seven - opened the door. The boy had a sour look on his face, and thrust his fist out at me without saying a word. He dropped into my hand a $10 and a $5, which covered the bill with about 24¢ to spare. No coupon. The kid took the pizza and soda, and quickly closed the door.\n\nWhatever, I thought. It wasn’t uncommon for customers to say they had a coupon when they didn’t, or they had one but wanted to milk it for as many orders as they could get away with. The measly tip galled me, but again, whatever. Something to note is that our drivers didn’t make a habit of keeping loose change in our pockets. Most transactions were by credit card, and cash orders were almost always concluded with paper money. As I wasn’t carrying the 24¢ on me, I couldn’t have given change, even if I’d had the chance.\n\nI got back to the shop and walked by the manager’s office. I could see he was on the phone with a very unhappy person through the window, and stopped by to listen to the end of his conversation.\n\n“I’m so sorry, sir. Yes. I’ll send him right out. Yes. He should be there in about fifteen minutes. I’m so sorry. Thank you.” *click*\n\nHe gave me a look that all customer service employees know well. The this-jackhole-wants-something-for-free-and-i-don’t-want-the-hassle look.\n\n“You just delivered to *street name redacted*, right?”\n\n“Yeah. Was there a problem?”\n\n“The guy says you didn’t give his son the change.”\n\n“It was, like, 24¢. The kid closed the door on me, and besides, we don’t carry loose change.”\n\n“Yeah, I know,” he said with a sigh. “Well, he’s pissed, and I’m send you over with a coupon for a free pizza. This isn’t your fault, we just don’t need him complaining to corporate. I said you’d bring the change as well.”\n“24¢?”\n\n“Yep.”\n\nHe pulled two dimes and four pennies from his pocket and handed them to me, along with a signed coupon for a free pizza. I left the building, annoyed that I was missing out on actual tipping runs for this moron.\n\nWhen I arrived, the dude was already out the front door and advancing on me. I got out of the car, and he brought his face a bit too close to mine for comfort. I could smell the whiskey on his breath.\n\n(Explicit language included for accuracy.)\n\n“You mother-fucker!” he screamed. “I try to teach my kid the value of money, and you short-change him! I gotta call your fucking boss just to get my own fucking money! I ought to kick your ass up and down this goddamn street for cheating a little kid!” He paused to take a breath.\n\n“Sir,” I said, as calmly as I could, ”I wasn’t trying to short-change your son. We don’t carry small change on us, usually…”\n\n“Bullshit!” he interrupted.\n\n“Sir, I have your change here…”\n\n“Fuck your change! Your boss said he was sending over a coupon. Did you bring it?”\n\n“Yeah, it’s right here.” I took the coupon out of my pocket, along with the 24¢ in change. “Again, I’m really sorry for the misunderstanding.”\n\n“This was no fucking misunderstanding, you retard. I’m calling your boss again, and your ass is fired!”\n\n“Sir…”\n\n“Fuck you, you little shit. You can’t even count. You probably have all the change you need, and just couldn’t fucking count to fifteen dollars…”\n\nAt this point, I’d had it. \n\n“Sir,” I said, again calmly, “I really don’t appreciate being talked to this way. I do not appreciate threats, and I do not appreciate my integrity and intelligence being questioned. We don’t carry loose change, and your kid closed the door in my face. Here.” I let the coins drop to the sidewalk. One went into a storm drain. \n\n“And here,” I said, and ripped up the free-pizza coupon. I let the torn pieces of paper flutter to the ground.\n\nThe guy didn’t say anything. His eyes bulged from his head, and his face turned a bright crimson. \n\nI turned and got into my car, and drove away.\n\nWhen I got back to the shop, I went straight to the manager’s office, expecting to get an earful. He was on the phone again, this time laughing hysterically. \n\n“Don’t worry,” my manager said, as he hung up the phone, “That prick is blacklisted. Nice job.”\n",

They gave us a 15 cent raise on that but shortly after, gas started to get much cheaper.\n\nI really can't help but feel like we'll be making less with this new system in place.

Things were normal as I took his address and name, explained our deals, and took his order.\n\nHe then started asking me about the delivery time since he was ordering a little later in the evening and had to be uo for work early the next morning. He also didn't want his pizza to be cold. Completely understandable. I explained to him that, while we had an over 50 minute delivery time since it was a Saturday and it was busy, that his pizza wasn't just going to sit there and that the wait was mostly for us to make it not necessarily deliver.\n\nHe seemed placated by that and started telling me how nice I was and how I was very good at customer service and was very helpful to him. He asked my name and how to spell it which wasn't unusual. Might have just wanted to leave a review. Then he started asking me if I went to school and where.\n\nThat threw me off a little, but I assumed you know, just making small talk. The next thing out of his mouth was \"You know, I may be old, but I know that sometimes you gotta do things you don't want to do to get the things you want\"\n\n I would have just thought he meant working a part time job to get through college to acheive something better if he hadn't of said in a drawn out, sultry tone and followed it up with \"You know, I gave you my full name earlier but my friends call me Dallas. And Dallas is a sexy name. And so is yours. It's perfect.\"\n\nI swiftly turned to my manager and made it admantly clear to him I was NOT taking that delivery and he would be sending a completely different driver. When I got back from my delivery which was thankfully not his my manager asked me why I was so against taking Dallas' order and I explained. We make jokes about him being my new boyfriend now, but at the time the whole situation made me EXTREMELY uncomfortable.",

It was a Friday and everything was going pretty well. It was around 12:30am and I already had about $80 in tips. I had a delivery close to the center of town to an apartment building. As I pulled up, I saw a few college kids out on the street. When I got out of my car, I could hear one of them yelling at a girl and the girl yelling back at him. Something something, he kissed another girl. \n\nAnyways, the guy who ordered waved me over and apologized for the commotion. He handed me his cash and I handed him the food and turned around to leave when I heard a drunk voice from behind me, \"Watch this, Domino's.\" This was followed by the girl asking him if he was going to hit her. I turned around to intervene, but the guy who ordered pizza had already gotten between the two and was pushing him away from the girl. \n\nI looked at him and we made eye contact. I stepped towards him and said, \"Hey. It's Papa John's.\"\n\nHe stepped towards me, \"Why don't you shut up, you fucking pussy?\"\n\nAs I stepped into my car, I muttered loud enough for him to hear, \"Says the guy trying to pick a fight with a woman.\"\n\nI then pulled up next to a police car that was down the road and told the officer he might wanna check out the situation. Drove back to the shop, checked in, and told my manager about it. He laughed and high-fived me and we went on with our night.\n\nEdit: Didn't think twice and spelled Domino's incorrectly.",

        "text": "Today started off alright, started at 6pm so I had time to finally watch Ant-Man with my girlfriend like we had been meaning to since it came out, so I was feeling pretty good. Then people happened.  \nFirst there was Steve and Carlos. Carlos had been waiting at a table for his carryout order for a while, and Steve came in and was standing at one of the registers that was currently being used to take a phone order. It was busy and everyone else was occupied, so as soon as I get in from a delivery, I start making my way to the only register that was not being used for phone orders. Before I get there, the girl at the oven calls out that Carlos's order is ready. Carlos stands up, I get his food from the hot rack and bring it to the counter, and Steve scoots over and says \"The line starts over here.\" I quickly give Carlos his stuff and oven girl calls out that Steve's order is ready. I didn't catch all of what was said, but Steve started yelling rude things at Carlos, who responded by yelling rude things at Steve. All I specifically remember was Steve yelling \"Why don't you go vote for Donald Trump,\" and Carlos yelling back \"You kinda look like Donald Trump with your crazy hair.\" Steve's hair reminded me of [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/FxHMReB.png). Anyway, it ended nonviolently with Carlos leaving before Steve finishing paying and everyone, including the other customers, laughing at what a child Steve was being once he left.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA while after that, I take a delivery to the far end of our area. The lady opens the door and her little dog runs out. I spend a few minutes helping her catch it, and while it didn't seem interested in running away, it did not want to go back inside, and it was fast. Eventually we caught it, she thanks me and signs the receipt with a line through the tip space and the exact price in the total.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOther than those incidents, the rest of the night was fairly average, a few good tips, a few bad ones, ended the night with an average amount of money, but I had closing shift tonight, and we close late on Saturdays. So it is me, a manager, and two other drivers closing, and the place is a mess. As soon as the majority of the drivers went home, it was a constant stream of orders, the phone would start ringing literally as soon as I got done taking a phone order three times in a row, so no cleaning was possible until we actually closed. About an hour and a half or so into cleaning, one of the other drivers says his dad called him saying his truck won't start and he needs to go help him. Manager asks to call the dad for proof that driver isn't just trying to leave early, but Driver says dad's phone is broken and can only make calls. Manager tells Driver to go just in case he isn't lying. Then he tells me how last week Driver called in because his car wasn't working, and AAA didn't have any paperwork to prove his car wasn't working, and asks rhetorically why Driver needs to go if they have AAA. Manager left a rather disapproving note for Gm. So with Manager doing manager closing stuff and me and Other Driver doing the cleaning (we are not the fastest at cleaning), we got out at 4am.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo that was my day, how was yours?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOh yeah, someone pissed all over the toilet seat and the floor surrounding the toilet, which was nice. /s",

        "text": "So I work in a decent-sized college town that has multiple franchise pizza stores and a few family owned. I work for one of the franchises, which I thought would depersonalize the experience of delivering pizzas a bit. But I was so wrong.\n\nWe have a few regulars who call in at least once every two weeks. There's a guy who always tips $10+ every time. There's a group of college girls who I always seem to deliver to that are absolutely hilarious and put a smile on my face. But my absolute favorite is the one who everyone else dislikes with a passion. \n\nEvery time he orders, there's a tremendous stipulation on the delivery remark. The first time I got him as a customer, he put, \"write a whimsical poem for tip!\" As an actual poet, I nailed it. It was something about the town we live in smelling like crap because it's surrounded by farms that use spray manure. Another one of my favorites was when he wrote, \"Draw Boba Fett for tip!\" As a terrible artist, I drew a frownie face on the inside. When he opened the box at the door and I explained, he laughed and handed me a tip and said to try harder next time. \n\nThis past time, however, was my absolute favorite. I saw the address and got giddy immediately and pulled up the order to see the remark. \"Tell me the make and model of the 1966 Batmobile for tip!\" My coworkers looked at it and just blew it off and cursed the guy. But I wasn't giving up. Naturally as a Batman fanatic, I actually already had the answer in mind. \n\nI got to the door and knocked. He opened the door and we greeted each other, I took his payment and gave him the food and he looked at me, waiting to be disappointed. But I smiled, \"The answer is the 1955 Lincoln Futura.\"\n\nHe laughed and handed me a $10 bill, \"You always were my favorite delivery boy.\"",
