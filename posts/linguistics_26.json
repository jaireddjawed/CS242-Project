Consequently, I found it hilarious, told my co-worker about it and showed her the video. While we were watching the video in my apartment together, my girlfriend from outside the apartment even mistook the video for the same co-worker.\n\nAnyway, both my co-worker and Lindsay Ellis are 20-something women from California, and I clearly think of the way they say \"fine\" to be novel of some sort, but I'm not sure why. \n\nMy question is, are the sounds Lindsay uses in the phrase novel in English, or something unique to either young women from California or even more generally America? Or is it just general American English and I'm just paying more attention to it just because of how many times the video repeats the phrase?\n\nHere's the video in question. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/AIIWy3TZ1eI\n\nThe phrase starts at 27:22\n\n",

However, there seem to be conflicting linguistic opinions as to whether umbrella language they should be grouped. \n\nThe Torlakian dialect of Goranski/Našinski spoken by the Muslim Gorani people in southern Kosovo is the one I am particularly interested in, because there is an ongoing controversy about \"Bosniakization\" (applying the ethnic label \"Bosniak\" to any south-Slavic Muslim group, such as the Torbeši in Macedonia and the Pomaks in Bulgaria) taking place througout the Balkans. If Goranski is indeed closer to Bosnian (Serbo-Croatian) than to Macedonian or Bulgarian this would kind of make sense but the other way around would not.\n\nAnyone who can share some insights into the south-Slavic dialects of this area and how they relate to one another?",

He started shouting YOU HAVE TO SPEAK YOUR LANGUAGE WHICH IS PORTUGUESE AND NOT ENGLISH.  Then I felt super awkward and started speaking Portuguese because i felt like that is what he wanted,  but my Portuguese sounds so different than Spanish that he thought I was speaking in English yet,  then he started literally yelling at me,  telling me to speak Portuguese. \n\n I want some clarification from South Americans.

However since linguistics has always been close to the field of sociology and anthropology I thought some of you guys might be able to help me out.\n\nTwo words about my situation: I'm a student in translation and I have to write a thesis by the end of the year, the major part of it is a translation from the Chinese to the French (I've decided to translate some short novels from the 民族文学 magazine, which are basically novels written by people from Chinese minorities), and a smaller but also important part is a 30-page introduction to this translation which is supposed to tackle a problem that is more or less related to the text(s) I will be translating.\n\nI've started to look around a little bit but am a bit lost at what I should start looking into. I wondered if any of you guys had any ideas of domains or topics about Chinese language, ethnic minorities, their own languages and stuff I could look into? I'm talking broad ideas here, I plan on doing the work myself of course.\n\nJust some things, I'd rather stay PRC-friendly as I want to be able to work there later and I can't go too deep into linguistics as my knowledge in this field is very limited. For the rest, I'm open to any suggestions. We are given a lot of freedom in the writing of our introduction so I can really go wherever I want with this as long as it's more or less related to what I'm translating.\n\nThanks!",

I strictly instruct all news readers, narrators, celebrities and anyone and everyone appearing on the TV to drop all final consonants. This would be very subtle in the beginning for example at first only final t would be dropped and replaced by a glottal stop, final p and k would be droped on some occasions. Eventually all final p, t, k would be dropped and b, d, g would be dropped and the preceding vowel would be lengthened. Final fricatives would be replaced by h (voiced h for voiced fricatives and voiceless one for voiceless ones). Final r would be dropped and replaced by a schwa and eventually the schwa would be dropped too. Speaking in this way won't be a problem for my voice actors because I would make sure that all of them receive the best voice training in the world. My question is now, would the new generation of Americans who would grow up watching TV also start to drop all final consonant? If this happens than would this sound change be considered different because it was done deliberately? Would this mean that in the future the wealthy and influential people who have control over the media mold any language as they please?",

Is this child abuse, as some commenters think?\n\nEdit: I think there's a high likelihood this if fake or extremely embellished... But, it's still an interesting question if we take it at face value\n\nEdit 2: I also want to note that it is well-known a kid in this situation with a natural L1 has the capacity for complete L2A. I guess I'm more curious what people think about the confounds of Klingon as a sole L1. It lacks vocabulary, the dad *probably* isn't fluent, etc. For example, 4 for first exposure to English is past phonemic distinction acquisition. While everyone differs, is it really fair for this dad to potentially force his kid to speak with a made up accent? ",

While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate disscussion all of the time, here are some examples: \n\n*Quick questions:*\n\n* Asking for an explanation of a technical term\n* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature\n* Asking how we would transcribe something\n* Asking how a feature works in a particular language\n\n*Not-so-quick questions:*\n\n* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim\n* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject\n\nIf you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.\n\nAlso, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first.

That changed when I learned about descriptive linguistics while implementing a HMM parts of speech tagger for an undergrad computing class.     \n       \nValidated, I  introduced \"y'all\" back in to my vocabulary, and have even staunchly defended it on occasion. In the years since, \"y'all\" seems to have gained greater acceptance, and those who maligned its use have re-formed their front line at the phrase \"*all* y'all,\" which they claim to be redundant (and just as \"uneducated\" as they previously claimed \"y'all\" to be).     \n        \nAs I hear it, \"y'all\" is very often used with a contextually-implied restriction or modification of \"all\". E.g. \"Are y'all going to Johns party tonight?\" could implicitly address \"all (who are friends of John)\" and not \"all (who are standing in front of me)\" and definitely not \"all (living humans).\" Since \"y'all\" is so often used this way, it makes sense to me to use the phrase \"*all* y'all\" when you want to *explicitly* communicate that the listener should not infer some subset.      \n        \nToday I ran across the wikipedia page for \"[contrastive focus reduplication\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrastive_focus_reduplication):      \n&gt;Contrastive focus reduplication, also called lexical cloning or the double construction, is a type of syntactic reduplication found in some languages. Doubling a word or phrase – such as do you LIKE-like him? – can indicate that the prototypical meaning of the repeated word or phrase is intended.[1] U.S. writer Paul Dickson coined the term word word in 1982 to describe this phenomenon.[2]      \n      \nI got excited because this seems to be exactly what I just described. However, I notice that there is a bullet point on the [wiktionary page for y'all](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/y%27all) which says      \n&gt;Notwithstanding its etymology, the all in y'all is merely a plural marker, not a quantifier.         \n         \nThis bullet point is not cited, but it seems fairly plausible to me as well.       \n       \nWhat do y'all make of it?",
