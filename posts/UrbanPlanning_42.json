        "text": "I apologize if this is the wrong place to post this, but I need perspectives from planners! So I live in Keller, TX, which is the definition of sprawled. The whole town is just islands of retail separated by seas of McMansions. It is just large enough and the roads are just big enough that walking is difficult and risky, and it's hot enough that biking is only for the hardcore. The problem with transit is that 90% of us work outside of Keller, in Dallas or Fort Worth, so it would be too difficult to plan a route that can even serve residents well enough. \n\nSo I (a layman, with no experience) have been toying with an idea, and I would like some feedback from people who actually know something. What if we offered a private transit solution? Use an app like Uber or Lyft for users to input their daily commutes, or weekend errand destinations or nightlife destinations--the places they consistently go. When enough users submit this information, the service takes an average (or does some other procedure, I'm not sure) of users' commutes in order to route a custom and dedicated line for a large vehicle, maybe even an actual bus. It would stop wherever the most number of people could walk to their pickup and dropoff locations, and wouldn't be limited by city limits, so if everyone in Keller TX works in the northern half of Dallas, it could take them there. It's a lot like a Kickstarter for a bus route. It would be less convenient than on-demand services like Uber, Lyft, or Via, but would hopefully be more efficient and cost effective per user because of the reduced numbers of drivers and vehicles. \n\nWhat are the biggest problems you see with this, from an urban planning perspective? Would it be destroyed by local red tape, etc? ",

As with many places in the U.S., this causes a extreme dependence on cars in this area and creates a headache for not only daily commuters going to both these cities, but also for anyone trying to get around at other times. \n\nMy initial question stems from the observation that these cities are so close, yet rely on poorly implemented and under-funded commuter rail as a means of travel that isn't relying on a car. Would an implementation of heavy rail (subway) help diminish the travel time and reliance on cars? I feel like the distance is too large for this, yet too small for commuter rail as a means of rapid, daily travel. \n\nAnd as a caveat, yes bus rapid transit (BRT) would be useful in this scenario, and is actually being proposed in the suburbs outside of DC, yet not farther north to connect the cities. In this question, I am only thinking of rail as they are already used to some degree in both cities.",

Cities like Copenhagen, Malmö, Tromsø, etc., tend to instead be composed of a small but dense urban core, and then huge amounts of single-family housing, especially when looking at Norway. How come this is the case?",

I honestly have no idea how one would go about it nor do I know if I have the resources/power/time to convince the city to change it.\n\nIt seems like a really good place to do it with lots of shops, cafes, and restaurants along this section of road. As well, there is a park across the road to the north and a bus hub just to the south. This could become a major walking highway for people to explore downtown.\n\nThank you for your time.

I think having more red light cameras and speed cameras on the road would help flag reckless and negligent drivers like the one above and revoke their license before they kill or injure anyone else.  The local police department here is seemingly unable or unwilling to go after moving violations so I think letting a machine do it automatically would be the best option.  What does /r/urbanplanning think?  ",
