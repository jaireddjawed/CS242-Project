Ever since I switched to this approach my Japanese skills are growing dramatically faster, and the language feels less weird and unnatural to work with. It’s hard to make things really stick through repetition alone; you have to give your brain a *reason* to remember it.",

But even though I have 15 hours of classes each week and hear the language spoken every day, it still just sounds like noise. I've built my vocabulary nicely and learnt a lot of grammar, but it is all useless if I can't have even basic interactions with people. Or even be able to recognize which words they're saying. \n\nIt's really started to become deeply depressing. Living in the appropriate country, I thought I'd have every advantage in learning. But even after 2 years I still cannot have even basic exchanges with anyone because I can't hear and distinguish the words. It still just sounds like 'afjkasfdljksad'.  What can I do to improve this?\n\nJust as a bonus question: why do those FSI time estimates seem so deeply optimistic, and am I stupid for taking so much longer? Danish is supposed to be a '575-hour' language to learn fluently. Yet at this point, I have had 1,380 hours of formal classes in addition to around 900 hours of at-home study. *2,280 hours* is a lot longer than 575, especially considering that those 2,280 hours have not only failed to bring fluency - they've failed to even get me to the point where I can hear which words anyone is saying. Not even in basic interactions like buying something from a cashier. Am I being punk'd or something by this language? Or are languages in general just fundamentally way, way more difficult than 'official' estimates say they are?",

The other group led by an Italian woman with a less powerful voice. As one might expect, a confrontation ensued... the Italian guide asking the Spanish one to keep it down. The Spanish guide pushing back. Eventually, it developed into a full blown argument (english, not spanish version of that word...) but in Spanish, as the Italian guide was fluent in that language as well. Eventually, after less than genuine apologies from the Spanish guide, and plenty of head shaking on both sides, things calmed down. The Spanish guide led her group out. The Italian guide, shaken, got her American group together, finished her bit on the theater space and headed out. \n\nOne American fellow, really taken by the spat he had witnessed, was giving thumbs up all around and cheering, \"Dude! First time I heard people fight in Italian ! Cool !\"\n\nMost Americans take Spanish in high school. Many take two are more years. Yet, in this environment, it was still the idea of place, rather than focusing on the language, that took over. The fellow knew his guide was Italian, he was in Italy, so he assumed the argument was in Italian. Maybe he had no Spanish or Italian. It can be confusing when Italian, Spanish and, say Catalan, have so much commonality and you're on a trip through southern Europe. But his exuberance while being wrong had me in stitches.",

I've used other resources like babbel and wasnt really pleased with how their system is. What are some resources you use to kind of push through the honeymoon phase of the language and really get into the A1/A2 stages? Do i really have endless hours of flashcards to do? Should i just watch beginner YouTubers for my TL and repeat pretty much whatever they say?\n\n I do want to make grammar flashcards, to learn the \"rules\" of the language and since I'm currently learning German too, whenever i notice words that are nearly or are identical i throw them into a flashcard deck that are for similar spellings and meanings. I'd also like to label objects around me in my everyday life to get a solid meaning of certain vocab, and to maybe check out some discord servers.\n\nAlso, I'd rather not have to pay for a tutor, as the interactions feel both forced and I would prefer a cheaper alternative. I can put some money towards resources, but id like study materials and can watch YouTube for grammar/pronunciation tips. I'm not opposed to learning how to speak the language, I'd just prefer to be a little further along my journey before i *make a fool of myself* for the first time in front of a native, on top of paying for it. Also me speaking it out loud, and actively thinking about it helps me learn it better and faster than studying flashcards. Like counting and vocab used regularly. \n\n\nTLDR; what do you use for resources besides Duo, endless flashcards, and tutors to learn your TLs?",

        "text": "I've been learning my TL for 6 years and I have a very good level as I'm able to communicate with no issues and the person I'm speaking with doesn't need to speak slowly at all. I noticed recently that it's really hard finding language exchange partners that are of the same gender. I don't mind men but I honestly prefer ladies as I'm more comfortable, when I activately tried to find other girls to speak to on the app like HelloTalk/Tandem, or the language exchange subreddit, my attempts end up with results as guys end up messaging me. Beggars can't be choosers but it's kind of annoying when I do message girls there and I'm left on read, especially that most girls complain about the same thing. I'm interested in the community's take on this?",

        "text": "I'm fluent in German (C1 certificate). In my German classes and with other people who don't speak german natively, I feel I can talk in German for miles a minute with them about anything under the sun. When it comes to talking to native Germans, especially ones that I want to befriend, I feel uneasy about talking to them and often very shy, like I suddenly don't know how to express myself or talk freely. I can only assume it's partially a perfectionist thing - often people tell me I sound like a native speaker, and there were times at clubs when I was drunk that I talked to people for a long time before they realized I wasn't German. I think that me wanting to uphold this sort of standard for myself makes it very difficult to speak to a german who says this to me in a foreign language because I want to show that I am good at speaking german. obviously after a few drinks I don't have as many issues with this. It's just really difficult for me because I want to make friends where I speak to a german exclusively in German, but normally, because it's easier for both of us when they speak english, and because I never have anything to say in German, we end up having a relationship that takes place fully in english.\n\n How can I get over this sort of mental hurdle and speak as freely as I can, in a way that's productive for making friends, in German? What are your experiences with this? Thanks!",

        "text": "For some communities, it is the norm to frequently code switch rather than solely staying in a single language. **How does code switching affect our ability to learn these aforementioned languages?** For context, I'm learning Tagalog &amp; it is frequently combined with English to form [Taglish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYLFoUTJuGU). It's doesn't just feature occasional loan words or interjections. Entire phrases are spoken in straight English, and plenty of English words are modified to fit into Tagalog grammar.\n\n\\---\n\nIn my experience, code switching is both a blessing and a curse. Because I'm a native English speaker, the code switching to English helped the Tagalog phrases make more sense with the extra context. This really helped me out when I first started learning and gave my brain extra time to process things.\n\nHowever, this eventually became a hinderance as I progressed in my TL. The code switching began to waste my time, replacing immersion in Tagalog with waiting until people stopped speaking English. Moreover, because most Filipinos can speak some English, they tend to switch to English when they realize what my native language really is. It's discouraging!\n\n\\---\n\nTo summarize, code switching is like training wheels for learners of the language. It can help in the beginning &amp; give you more confidence to continue studying/immersing, *only if* the code switching involves a language you already know. But, it's also a crutch which keeps you from improving, robbing you of time you could have spent with your TL, whether listening or speaking opportunities. \n\nIf your TL has a similar situation to Tagalog/Taglish, code switching feels like you're permanently stuck with these training wheels. Don't give up on trying to achieve a high level in your TL! Try to find content with less code switching, such as the news. Try to find opportunities in your to speak with older/less educated people who prefer to avoid code switching. It might be harder for us to progress, but it is certainly not impossible.\n\nI'm curious to hear other people's experiences &amp; thoughts!",

        "text": "In [this past thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/upyfd8/why_i_encourage_reaching_an_advanced_level) the argument was that maintenance becomes a lot easier once you reach an advanced level. And if you stop learning a language cold turkey, you lose all the benefits of spaced repetition. Therefore you should strive to learn a language to as high a level as possible before moving on.\n\nHere is the issue. Typically the time required to reach the levels looks something like this:\n\nA1: 100h  \nA2; 200h  \nB1: 400h  \nB2: 800h  \n\nSo the difference between reaching A1 and reaching B2 is usually a matter of months vs. a matter of years. \n\nIn the time it takes to reach B2 in Greek, I could reach A1 in Persian, Hungarian, Hebrew, Romanian, Hindi, Turkish and Greek (just be completing say the Assimil courses).\n\nI could have the explicit goal to \"get to know\" several languages without having any aspirations of ever becoming fluent in them. Be it for linguistic purposes, to get a good overview of the languages or to be able to force myself through a newspaper article via intensive reading if the need ever were to arise.\n\nHowever, somewhere between A1 and B2 there is a \"point of no return\" where quitting a language becomes too costly because you have wandered too deep into B1 territory without having gained much fluency. Once you have put in 100h, it's easy enough to quit. Once you've put in 500h, not so much. So if we stop early enough, we should be good, right?\n\nBut can A1 or A2 even be a desirable goal in and of itself?    \nHow much do you actually know about a language like Turkish after studying it for 100 hours?  \nIs the goal of reaching A2 itself a waste of time (because the end result is useless and it will be hard to maintain)?",

Easier time reading the text than actually keeping up with the audio, even though it's slow and quite clear. \n* **75h**: started gradually understanding more of native speakers when they're speaking clearly, like on a podcast. \n* **100h (July 2022)**: I can understand the gist of some podcasts/videos aimed at native speakers (U Kulatého Stolu), recognize maybe half the words in a show like Zločiny Velké Prahy and get a vague idea of the plot and what's going on, understand pretty much everything in the Lingq Mini Stories\n* **150h (December 2022)**:  I switched mainly to audio content, sometimes for natives and other times podcasts for learners, not because I suddenly understand everything, but because it's easier to fit into my routine than video. I mainly listen to U kulatého stolu and Zdenkův Český Podcast. \n\n# Comprehension \n\n*   **Level 5** comprehension for the **Lingq Mini stories** (I can understand almost all the words, most full sentences, and have enough brainpower left to start noticing grammatical structures and declensions while still making sense of the content)  \n*   **Level 3** comprehension in a podcast with native speakers like **U kulatého Stolu** (I can understand some full sentences, but I'm mostly getting the gist of what is being talked about, and I can't really get the nuanced parts of the conversation - I can say whether the person thinks something is bad/agrees/disagrees, but probably not why)  \n*   **Level 2** comprehension at a tv show for native speakers like **Zločiny Velké Prahy** (can get the general idea, a lot of unknown vocab, sometimes I don't really understand the big breakthrough in the investigation that allows them to catch the murderer) or YT videos like **Kluci z Prahy** (they speak really fast even though I can make out some words/phrases)   \n*  I still have **trouble understanding** when people aren't enounciating very clearly or native speakers that just **speak as they normally would** and blend their words together. That's probably going to take me a while to improve on, which is fine by me. \n* I still have **trouble** with people just having a **chill conversation on a YT video**. I can understand more of what's written in subtitles than if I had to actually listen to what's being said and parse it.\n\n# Imersion Content\n\n* **Lingq original Mini stories/Silly mini stories**. I'm not using these as much anymore, but it's quite interesting listening to them again and being able to pick up on grammatical patterns and details that I missed the first time around because I was too busy trying to make out the meaning of what was being said. \n* Started dabbling with more native content and more audio content\n* Mostly listening to **podcasts** in the last 25h - Učíme se česky (really good!), Hezký Cesky s Petrou Jiraskovou, Czech with Iva, Zdenkův Ceský Podcast, Slow Czech, the first few chapters of Harry Potter, fairy tales for children\n* **TV shows for children** \\- highly enjoyed Evropské pexeso, a show with short episodes about each of the countries in the EU. It´s nice to have the accompanying visuals as an aid in comprehension. \n* Really like **I learn Czech** on YT for grammar explanations. \n* Some random TV shows on **iVysilaní**. Sometimes I just type a word in and see what comes up, or watch one of the recommended shows for some variety. You can get the app for free, but for some reason the subtitles won't work for me, so I mostly use the browser version.   \n\n# Reflections\n\n* I think **starting out with easier content** (comprehensible input) to build a foundation really **helped**, and creating Anki cards (**sentence mining**) from all the unknown vocab from the Mini Stories was a good use of my time. \n*  **Listening to things multiple times was also helpful**, because it helped me notice more that didn't even register the first time around. I can now notice a lot more, and pay attention to how phrases are constructed, what's going on with the prepositions and declensions, etc. However, that can get a bit boring, so switching things up in the meantime was also nice.   \n* There's still a long way to go, but the **progress** I've seen so far really **helps keep me motivated** \n* **Choosing topics that I find interesting** helps keep me engaged while watching even if I can't understand everything. \n* I can now get the **gist of some written Czech**, like simple news articles. I still think it's easier to understand written Czech than spoken, because there is more time to process things. \n* I finally feel like I'm **starting to get used to some of the grammar**, like the fact that certain prepositions require certain cases. Even though I can't necessarily apply that fact in sentences I come up with, I can look at a headline and make sense of the fact that a word is in the genitive case, or that there's a preposition that requires the locative, and so on. \n* It also feels like I'm finally **getting used to the sound and the rhythm of the language**, which is nice\n* I don't think I've had any improvements in **producing the language,** but I haven't really tried to speak much in the meantime. I'm pretty sure that when I do go for it, it's gonna be a bit easier because I might actually understand what the other person is telling me. \n\nIf you've made it all the way to the end, thanks for reading!",

        "text": "Hello everyone. I have been trying to learn german for several months now. I started out with Duolingo but lessons were getting repetitive and I felt like I wasn't learning anything. So I started using Babbel. I started off strong but slowly as the lessons get more complex (very simple phrases) I am having trouble remembering very basic things like saying Mir Gehts gut which ive been trying to learn for days and just cant seem to remember it whenever it pops up on the review. I do not have a learning disability or anything so I am wondering if this is a normal thing for beginners? I just cant remember how to conjugate verbs, I cant remember what words are what gender, and its just been difficult. I spend a little less than an hour total most days reviewing and doing new lessons. Also When I do the writing review where most of the time it gives me the words I have no problem. But when I do the flashcards I cant even remember how to start most sentences. Is it better to use the writing or the flashcards? Thank you any tips and advice is appreciated",

I've been frustrated because I thought my Spanish would translate better than it does. Pronunciations are completely different. Probably 50 to 60% of the words are the same but the pronunciations are completely different. I found an app called language transfer on Google Play which has Italian which has also been on my list to learn.  If no one has heard of language transfer before it is by  far the best language learning program I have ever found. But they don't currently have Brazilian Portuguese there. So I've looked at apps like rocket language and mondly. I did the first disc of the pimsleur Brazilian Portuguese program. But I don't know that any of them feel that effective. Especially after my experience with language transfer recently for italian. Just wanted to get everybody's feedback on what their preferred methods are. Pronunciation like a local is a really big deal to me.",

I often ask it to transliterate a piece of text, it’ll get it wrong and I follow with:\n\n‘No, please transliterate, not translate into the Greek alphabet whilst the text still remains in the English language, just using Greek orthography’\n\nAnd that usually works.\n\nGood luck",
