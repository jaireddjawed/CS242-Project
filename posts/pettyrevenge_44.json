        "text": "Sorry for formatting. I’m on mobile! \n\nBack story. So I had a best friend of like 9 years. We did so much together. She was super close to my family. She worked at the fairgrounds so she would get my family a free parking pass and a number of admin tickets. We had a fight in high school about communication and we didn’t talk for months and finally, after we graduated, we decided if we have a problem with each, we’re going to be adults and talk it through. \n\nSo I am now in a bigger city about 2 hours away. I went to college at a university known for its partying. So when I was 18-19 I went through the phase of drinking and partying and now I’m older with a more stable job and a happy relationship, I don’t need to do that. She was sheltered a lot growing up so she didn’t have the same chance to party and drink. So when she turned 21 she went wild. \n\nAbout a year ago almost, she was supposed to come up and visit for the weekend. We had talked two days before she was going to be up here and talked about what we were going to do. The day comes and I wake up early as text her that I’m awake. 2 hours later, when I know she’s supposed to be here, I texted her again. No reply. Around 6 that evening I messaged her a long text saying I don’t know what happened. Is everything okay? All the works. She read it, because she has her read receipts on, but never replied. I have not heard from her since. I have stopped trying to communicate and honestly I don’t care anymore. I still think it’s shitty given the fact that we had been friends for years. \n\nOnto the revenge. A few months before all this, she had given me her cable password because my boyfriend and I don’t have cable and we really don’t want to spend the money on it since we use the streaming services and the shows we watch are on one network. So she gave it to me but asked me not to give it to anyone. Wellllllllll. \n\nMy boyfriend has it. His mom has it. My sister has it. My brother will get it when he goes off to college. It’s a really small thing but it’s so satisfying because she will never know. We can’t change anything we’re just watching the shows we like with it. \n\nEdit: few things I want to point out that people have mentioned. First I know that she is healthy and alive and living the best life she can. Plenty of mutual friends have reassured that. Believe me. I would not just love my life without knowing if she was okay. I know the revenge isn’t much but to me it’s just something that made me feel like I have a little bit of power in a powerless situation because she left me completely in the dark. ",

        "text": "Several years ago I was traveling with an ex in Cambodia. It was our last night sleeping in a 10-bed dorm style room in a hostel in Siem Reap, where the famous Angkor Wat temples are found. We'd been there for a beautiful couple days of viewing the ancient structures and getting mild food poisoning and were planning to wake up early and catch a bus north to Laos in the next morning. \n\nNow, a popular activity at Angkor Wat is to wake up when it's still dark and watch the sun rise over the temples.  I say this to help you understand that, basically, most of the people sleeping in our big shared room, myself included, went to sleep extra early and were planning to drag ourselves out of bed before 5am for our own important reason.  As most adults know, when you have to wake up that early, having a stranger refuse to make the most minimal effort not to wake you is a serious offense. Humans need sleep.\n\nBack to the story! It was 11pm and those of us in the dorm had been lights out, passed out for at least an hour. It was then that a drunk couple returns to the room. They make no effort of trying to be quiet for the sake of the other 8 people there. They flip on the light for a half second before switching to phone lights and messily flopping into one of their beds. These dummies then begin making sounds with their mouths I can only describe as wet spaghetti-esque.  Not sex, but loud smooching and smacking and occasionally trading the obnoxious cliches you hear from young people deeply invested in their 3 month relationship. This goes on for long enough that at some point, someone attempts to politely shush the couple, which the girl responds to with a string of slurred \"fuck youuuu\"s.  Soon after, the girl gets into her bed (directly next to me) and they spend the next half hour slurring back and forth \n\n\"I love you.\" \n\n\"I love you too.\"\n\n\"I miss you\"\n\n\"Me too, I miss you so much.\"\n\n\"Goodnight baby\",\n\n\"Goodnight I love you.\"\n\n\"I love you too\" and on and on.  \n\nThey weren't even attempting to whisper.  It was the romantic dialogue of a Nicholas Sparks novel if he'd written it while incapacitated by a high fever.  I found myself praying that this couple would pull a Notebook and both drop dead at the exact same time.\n\nBut instead, it got worse.  The pair of dummies finally passed out, but less than an hour later, girl dummy's phone alarm goes off. It wakes most of us up, but not her.  It takes a minute of yelling by different bunkmates to wake her up enough to shut it down. A half hour later, it goes off again.  This time it takes even longer for her to awaken from her Captain Morgan induced slumber and turn off her phone. This happened ANOTHER SIX TIMES. As her REM kicked in, it became harder to wake her enough for her to silence her alarm. Those of us in the room had to yell at this girl for multiple minutes before she'd finally comply. Several times other people actually got out of bed to try and reason with her to shut down her phone entirely but she was too far blacked out to even hear them.\n\nFinally the alarms seemed to stop and I was able to fall back asleep, but not for long. When another one shrieked me awake, I was completely fucking done. I had barely an hour left before I planned to wake up, pack my bag, and head out, and I was physically and emotionally exhausted from this inconsiderate bitch. I got up and tried to shake her awake. She was just gone, nothing worked. I grabbed her fancy new iPhone and pushed it into her hand and insisted she open the lock screen so I could turn off her alarms. Somehow, she actually managed it without even opening her eyes. Miracles do happen. I opened her app to turn off the alarm that's still blaring and see that this chick has SIXTEEN more alarms slated to go off before 10am. Less than 30 minutes apart.  They were labeled with shit like \"hair appointment\" and \"english class\", meaning clearly this idiot set them way back before she left her home country and not even considered shutting them off when knew she'd be sleeping in a communal space.  \n\nI've never been a vindictive person. I keep my revenge fantasies deep inside like most functional, empathetic adults.  But I was furious at these inconsiderate drunk children, who chose to fuck up a full nights sleep for several people currently in the midst of a once-in-a-lifetime trip. I turn off all her alarms and switch the phone to silent.  Like an executioner marching a criminal to the chopping block, I carry it to the bathroom and drop it in the sink.  The faucet goes on and becomes an aesthetic Tumblr gif, clear water cascading over the shiny brand name phone. I give it a couple minutes and then I return to the room and slide the phone under her mattress.\n\nWe checked out of the hotel early, long before dummies 1 &amp; 2 woke up for their breakfast shots. I'd say I managed about 2.5 hours sleep total, especially rough considering the full day of bus and boat rides we had ahead of us. My exhausted misery was softened by the solace I took in imagining this girl who'd tortured us all for so many hours struggling to find her phone when she awoke and, if she was smart enough to look under her mattress, knowing that her phone was then water damaged and totally unusable. Her ability to take selfies in culturally inappropriate places and use her map apps to find the closest bar were long gone. Maybe she'd even be unable to check into her future hotels. All I know is traveling without a smart phone in this day and age is a challenge. Much more difficult than not being a shitty person.\n\ntl;dr: A rude, drunk chick in a hostel had over 20 alarms set to go off all night long, in a foreign city where most people wake up extra early to see epic sunrises, so I drowned her phone and hid it from her.",

        "text": "So for a bit of backstory, I used to live in an apartment with a couple of roommates, overall nice enough guys, but did have quite a few habits that rubbed me the wrong way (I know, very rare for roommates to have that effect). Being relatively fresh out of high school, this was the first place I lived away from my parents, the reason I mention that iis because I never really needed to purchase my own common household items, so I did not have many of those things when moving. So, I needed to start fresh. A little bit about myself; I am the type of person that will spend a fair bit of money in order to get something that is of good quality, in order to make it last. I am also a fairly tidy person, not to the extent that everything needs to be immaculate, but to the extent that I don't like messes, and would expect that others would be capable of picking up after themselves.\n\nSo, upon moving in, being young and poor, I think of the things that I can afford to skimp on, in order to save money. I thought one place quality was important to me, however, was some nice cookware which I would be able to use for many years to come. With all of that being said, I am more than happy to share my things with roomates, under the condition that they are, of course, respected and washed afterward. \n\nCut to a few months in, when the new guy moves in. He asks if he can use the cookware, and of course I told him he may. To be fair to him, at this time I did not ask him to wash it when he was done, I always assumed that was implied. Well, in his eyes apparently it was not. He cooked the same greasy thing in the pan daily, so he never even bothered to take it off the stovetop. After asking him countless times at this point to wash it, he was not getting the message. I would try and wash it and hide it in the cupboards behind the other pots and pans, but they all seemed as if they were about to fall apart, so naturally he would dig through the cupboards to find mine.  My frustration would peak when I would go to cook, and I would need to was the pan both before and after I used it. On the daily, when I would come back from classes and see my same dirty pan sitting on the stove my blood would boil. \n\nThis is when the pettiest response I could think of came in, I thought to myself, if I can’t use the pan without washing it first, neither could he. So, I asked myself what was the most annoying thing to clean from dirty dishes, and what came to mind was burnt cheese. So, everyday I would walk through the door and see my dirty pan on the stove, I would walk over, turn the stove on, and drop a big handful of cheese on the pan, let it burn and then walk to my room. I was prepared to buy as much cheese needed for him to learn to clean up my pan. But lucky for me, after about a week he got the message, and when returning from class, I would no longer see my dirty pan on the stovetop.\n",

She decided to also bring her kid over and just make me watch them.\n\nIt's usually only me and my mother in the house and it's very quiet. Most devices connect ti the wifi would be 4-5.\n\nNow that all this is happening it's stressing me out. When I can play Xbox I just lag around. Internet is the only bill I pay but remember it was just me and my mom before. She was fine with this and she made more than enough money to cover everything else. I pay for internet because I game a lot and don't like lagging.\n\nWell my awesome internet can't handle 12 devices all streaming Netflix. Even though we are grandfathered into a Unlimited 4G  Data contract they still use the wifi. I turned my mobile hotspot on and named it the same thing as my internet. Logged on to my router and changed the name and hid the profile.\n\nI told them I was restarting the internet and now they are all connected to my shitty hotspot that they think is real internet. Now all they do is bitch that they are lagging. Now they now how it feels.\n\nTL:DR. Disabled main wifi and turned on my hotspot as the same name. They are all now connected to my hotspot instead of my internet and I can play Xbox now.",

        "text": "Hi, long time lurker, first post. Not on mobile, but bleh bleh don't really care if my grammar or spelling is off.\n\nWent to the theatre to see a movie a couple of months ago (can't remember which one). You can pay extra for the AVX screen, better sound, clearer effects, and assigned seating (this is the important part). No this is not an ad for the theatre. SO (significant other) and I get all settled, when a family sits down in front of us. No biggie. \n\nThe seriously annoying part was the kid sitting in front of me. He was maybe 13-14, more than old enough to know better. He starts rocking back and forth in his chair, they recline a little, so they're pretty comfy. I let him do this for 5 minute, 10 minutes. Kid isn't going to stop. I paid extra to see this movie, premium seating right in the middle of the theatre, we always make sure to get the middle seats. Sure, they paid extra too, but annoying the other guests is not a part of the extras.  By now kid is pissing me off. \n\nPetty revenge, I put my boots against the back of his chair so it stops moving and it won't rock. He glances behind him, I just stare at him. After about half an hour, I move my feet out of the way to see what he does. Does he take this opportunity to be an adult? Nope, cause this post wouldn't be here if he did. So I watch the rest of the movie with my boots jammed against his chair. He kept glancing behind to see what was holding him in place. Well, guess what. I to see this movie in peace. You want to annoy me, enjoy the rest of the movie without being able to move your chair.\n\nEnd of the movie and they get up to leave. Kid turns to see me sitting there with a big old grin and death in my eyes.\n\nDon't know if this is petty enough but it sure made me feel good.",

I do appear in it, though, for which I am thankful.\n\nThe cast goes as follows:\n\n\\- - -\n\n**Me**: Yours truly\n\n**Mimosa**: My girlfriend\n\nStill with me? Great.\n\nYou see, we have this special cereal in the stores that’s called in my native language something like “Berriful cereal happy muesli”. It contains berries, cereal and muesli. Not sure about happiness. I love the stuff. Mimosa hates the stuff.\n\nSo, two days ago I was working remotely from home as I always do. Mimosa was happily updating her FB on our bed. All was well in the world. By lunchtime I was feeling an intense hankering for some Berriful cereal happy muesli. But alas! We had run plumb out this delicacy. So I did what any decent man would do: humbly begged Mimosa to go get some from the nearest supermarket, pronto.\n\nShe was less than happy to leave her post for my shitty cereal, especially as storm clouds were darkening the sky at an alarming pace, but hey, I had to work, too bad.\n\nAfter a ~~leisurely round of Overwatch~~ period of time working REALLY hard, I heard a key turn in the lock. Enter: a sopping wet Mimosa, huffing with a gruesome, patented Mimosa-rage. Whilst she had been enroute to the supermarket, the gods of thunder had decided to end the month-long heat wave in one fell swoop. She looked like she had been hosed down like John Rambo in the beginning of First Blood.\n\nShe was trembling with cold. I was trembling with fear.\n\nLeaving a wet trail behind her, she stomped into the kitchen, poured a bowlful of Berriful cereal happy muesli with milk for me and slammed it on the table. Then she poured an even bigger bowl for herself, sat opposite me and started shoveling the stuff in her mouth with murder in her eyes.\n\nOnce I had mustered enough courage, I asked her didn’t she hate the cereal anymore.\n\nMimosa: “Still do. But this piece of shit cereal made me get wet… so I’m taking my revenge on it by EATING IT!”\n\nThank you, Mimosa, for exacting your vengeance on the correct party.\n\nOh, and I hope I got you with the title, dear reader ;)",

I also had an undiagnosed learning disorder so school was not easy and I was one of the dumb kids.\n\nA group of girls - mean girls if you will, tortured me. When I say tortured I mean slamming my head into a dumpster, stealing my stuff and spreading pretty heinous rumors around school. Needless to say high school wasnt fun. One of the girls, I'll call T, was their ring leader. She was your quintessential pretty girl cheerleader you get the idea. I ended up changing schools cuz the abuse was so bad. Flash forward 5 years after high school and I got my learning disorder sorted and I have a really good job, nice car etc.\n\nOne morning I pull up to the drive thru to get my coffee. The voice on the intercom was familiar, T had a voice that could bend steel. I place my order and pull up. Well there she is, and she recognizes me \"oh hey [uses terrible high school nickname]\" I smile and say \"oh hey T\" I grab my coffee and hand her the money, before dropping my change in her hand I say \"you know T, I always had a feeling that I'd be telling you how I like my coffee\".\n\nThis was a good 15 years ago but the look on her face was something I could never forget. \n\n",

        "text": "This happened a few weeks ago but my sister finally convinced me to post this here. My family was checking into an airbnb apartment on vacation, when we got there we met up with our Airbnb host in the lobby of the building and she brought us to the elevators to bring us up to the apartment on the 15th floor. \nTo give you an idea of what this place is like, the building is one of those apartment buildings in Asia that are really tall but kinda gross and cheap looking, and in a group of 20 identical buildings. A lot of people live in these buildings but the elevators run very slowly so there's always a line of people waiting to go up to their apartments. Also, in this part of Asia it's pretty normal for people to line up in front of a specific elevator, so my family just chose the one on the right with a short line. \nAfter waiting about 10 minutes, our elevator finally comes and the airbnb host gets in and pushes the 15th floor button, but as the rest of my family is getting on, a woman (I'll refer to her as A-hole) comes from a different line, shoves my sister out of the way, pushes my grandmother (who uses a cane to walk) into the elevator and then casually hits the button for the 32nd floor. \nThe host starts yelling at A-hole, as do I and my parents, but she just ignores us. When my whole family got in the elevator (there's six of us plus our luggage) the elevator started beeping to indicate that it was overweight. The host, my family and everyone in line outside start yelling at the A-hole to get off, but she just ignores us. After waiting for about 2 minutes, my dad decides to just step off the elevator and take the next one so we can at least get to the apartment. So the elevator doors close and we're going up, and our host starts telling A-hole that she is an A-hole, and that she should die in A hole. A-hole then starts screaming back at our host about how she had been waiting for the elevator for longer than us (not true, I remembered seeing her walk in) and that she needed to get upstairs so she can go home and sleep. The back and forth between the airbnb host and A-hole keeps getting louder and louder until its a full on screaming match. Finally, after a long 90 seconds (at least that's what it felt like) the elevator opened on the 15th floor. The yelling continued as the host and my family got off the elevator. This is where my pettiness kicked in- after everyone in my group (my family and the airbnb host) got off the elevator, I hopped back in, dragged my open fingers across the elevator buttons Buddy the Elf style, and jumped out before A-hole could react. Keep in mind A-hole has 17 more floors to go. I saw A-hole try to put her hand in the door to keep it from closing, but she couldn't get there in time, and watching the look on her face as the door closed was priceless.\nThe best part of this whole thing came later though- when my dad got up to the 15th floor, he was laughing so hard he couldn't breath. He then ran up to me and hugged me- I forgot that there are cameras in the elevators and a monitor above the door of each elevator on the first floor. They're there so people waiting for the elevator can see if there's anyone inside that they have to let out before crowding the door to go in. Well, according to my dad, everyone in line in the lobby watched the whole fight on the little TV, and people were cheering when I hit all the floor buttons. A-hole ended up riding the rest of the slow elevator ride with the doors opening on each floor, and the lobby could see her defeated facial expression on the camera. I never personally saw it, but knowing that we won was the best feeling ever.\n\nTl;Dr woman doesn't wait for her turn to get on the elevator, pushes my family and starts yelling at us, I pushed all the floor buttons so she has to stop at 17 floors before she can get off.

Not only does he love playing games, he loves getting really good at multiplayer games with the sole intent to beat me every time we play together.\n\nWhen I was six years old, my brother and I would play Biker Mice from Mars (a racing game) constantly on our SNES. With him being five years older than me, he would take advantage of the fact that he knew how to play the game, whereas I couldn't even tell the difference of driving forwards or driving backwards. This would always result in him basking in the glory of his victories and myself sulking in a corner.\n\nThere was absolutely no way I would be able to beat him in a race until I noticed a pattern in his gameplay. Whenever he had to pause the game (to do some chores), he would always return in a bountiful sprint, jump on the beanbag and press the resume button in one swift motion. It so happened that the pause menu for this game had two options: resume or self-destruct. If there was ever a way I was going to get back at my brother, this would be it. \n\nWhen he paused the game to do some chore, I changed the highlighted menu option to self-destruct. As anticipated, he ran into the room, jumped on the beanbag and pressed the button to resume. His character blew up and I had the glory of completing the level knowing that instead of coming in last place, I would be second to last. For me at that age, that meant everything.\n\ntl;dr: Brother never lets me win at a racing game, when he leaves to do chores, I change the menu option from resume to self-destruct so he blows himself up.",

        "text": "I use to work at the big M ( Mcdonald's) in high school with a few of my classmates--lets call them C and J. \nJ had dropped out of high school in our sophomore year, he was a year older or so because of being held back. He worked at a carwash, and had been kicked out of his house by his dad for dropping out so he was couch surfing with a few mutual friends and C. Then he went to stay at his grandfathers a hour away, where he ran up his elderly grandfathers credit cards and put him into debt. He was a major POS. \n\nWe had been friends before he dropped out, and C was still pretty close. So J would hang out at Mcdonald's for C to get off work, and he would do this for hours--making prank calls,and driving through the drive thru repeatedly asking for free food. J idly had mentioned a few times of him joining the army.\n\nWeeks later, I was called by the recruiters office asking if I had seen J because he was suppose to go to with them or something like that. I told them we weren't really friends or close but I had been at work the night before and he was waiting for C to get off work. I proceeded to give them C's # and for them to call him. The man proceeded to tell me that they had called C and he hadn't seen him either. I wished them best of luck and apologized that i couldn't help them.\n\nLong story short, this happened twice with different offices. C confided in me weeks later that he had actually been with J both times they came looking for J. \nC: Did they give you any trouble?  I turned my phone off the first time and the second time I just let it ring over and over.\nMe: What were you even doing?\nC:Playing video games.\n\n\nJ had put strain on C's relationship with his girlfriend and been bragging about fooling the army twice. Needless to say it pissed me off. J caused C's girlfriend to break up with him after a lengthy drama session about J saying that it was okay with C if she had s*x with J bbecause they were BFF. She wasn't buying it. So J got mad and he went to her work and apparently wrote SLUT AND C*m dump on her car and j*zzed on her car handle. Small town petty crap.\n\nSo a week after that J came though the drive thru ordering a Big Mac. I was working headset and being very bitter I told C. C was already pissed about his girlfriend. So J went through drive thru--yelled at me for the price being too high. \n\"How am i suppose to pay for this? I just lost my fifth or so job?\"\nMe: not my problem. Try not to do burnouts in front of your job when you call off. \n\nC comes up and hands J a burger though the window, says nothing and turns away. After J leaves, all smug that he got free food.\n\nLater that shift( night) \n\nMe: Why did you give him free food? That was food for your lunch break.\n\nC: I think i can stand not eating. That burger I gave him? I spit in it.\n\nEdit: i should elaborate more... Oops. So a few months after this his grandfather had kicked him out for the credit card thing and something else (the mother of all rules that J wasn't allowed to break) but J refused to return his grandfather's classic car. It was like some old for or something. So his grandfather being fed up, turned him in to the police and he was caught for theft. They gave him a choice--army or jail for so long. I have no idea how he got that deal. \nHe actually went into the army and o guess they gave him hell because of the hiding\nThe next thing happened before his grandfather turned him in....\n\nThis reminded me of his casual girlfriend, but she popped up on my feed last night. She was one of those girls--the one that cheats on you and then goes to the person she was cheating on you with--but she also had the personality of a used condom. Which she never made people use..... So lets call her R. The last time i had seen J for an actual conversation he was complaining of a burning down there and that she hadn't got her period in a week. Then he made the mistake of asking me for advice, (being a medical show nut). R was cheating on him with my classmate--L. After telling him how babies were made, I told him that if R didn't get her period the day of... He was going to be a father. He grew pale. All lies. So me and C came up with a plan... Lets send grandfather a bunch of flowers to make him ACTUALLY FOLLOW THROUGH WITH. SHIPPING THIS ASSHOLE OFF. We knew where his grandfather worked( a repair shop) we went in as a flower delivery that said in red letters with daisys \"CONGRATS ON BEING A GREAT GRANDFATHER. J KNOCKED ME UP AND SAID I COULD MOVE IN~R\"\n\nShe didn't even know and wasn't even pregnant.  That caused J to be kicked out and finally be forced to own up to lazy ass.\n\nWhen they finally shipped him off--the recruiters called mr and told me that they finally had caught hhim and they apologized for bothering me... I told them no problem and good luck. 👍",

After sitting there for 20 minutes, my wife and three of my four children went to the bathroom leaving me and my youngest at a large table that seats 8. \n\nI guess it was busy because some old grumpy guy came along with a salad and sits down next to me without saying anything. If he has asked to share the table I would have offered the extra spots. What the old man didn't know was that he was sitting where one of my sons had been before and across from the spots where my other two children had been sitting. \n\nI said nothing. I didn't even look at him. I just let him sit and eat. \n\nThen my family came back. The boy who's seat was stolen just sits in one of the empty spots but the old man was suddenly sitting across from my three youngest children, two of whom were jumping on the bench and singing. In other words, he sat next to a man and his fairly well behaved toddler and ended up in the middle of a zoo. \n\nHe ended up getting up and moving to the table behind me. \n\nI could have kept my kids quiet and well behaved, but he could have said something before sitting down next to a family.

Shortly (like hadn't left the hospital yet, shortly) after my child was born, I found out my fiance had quite a few women on the side...including a wife and a few kids. Adding to this, having a child woke me up and I didn't want his abuse to be directed towards the child. He left me but when he wanted to come back (guess his side chicks were busy??) I had changed the locks and told him no. He was most welcome to be a father to his child (spoiler alert: he passed on it) but he wasn't putting boots under my bed anymore. \n\n\nI asked him to make sure his stuff was out of my house within the month. 2 months go by and he's disappeared completely and his crap is still here. I bagged it up and put it in the garage for trash pick up. Magically he calls to get his stuff. Sure come get it. I'm a nice person so I took everything back out and folded each item of clothing...around a piece of cat crap. I had just cleaned out the litter boxes so I had it on hand. \n\nHe must have taken a while to unpack because it was a few days before the incessant calls and texts came in. Petty but satisfying. \n\nTL/DR fiance cheated with several women, dipped after baby was born. Left his stuff at my house for too long, I packed it in cat poo. He was mad. ",

For example, I liked turkey burgers, so i'd always pick up a box of the really good ones when i'd do groceries. He liked them too, but he would buy the shitty brand that was thin and cardboardy to save money. He'd then proceed to eat mine and offer me his, his logic being that they were both the same thing(why eat mine then?). \n\nHe'd do this and lots of other annoying shit all the time; leaving sweaty gym shirts on all the furniture when he got home, stealing toilet paper from other peoples' bathrooms, etc. So one day me and my other roommate(not him) are hanging out and decide to exact revenge. We grabbed a bottle of desitin(diaper rash cream) and stirred it into the cream cheese Douchebag Roommate kept in the fridge. We even sprinkled bread crumbs in the container for added realism. \n\nNo idea how long he used it before throwing it away, or even if he did, but it felt satisfying anyway.",

        "text": "Over the past several years my relationship with my parents has been deteriorating. They do not respect my wife, the way we raise our children or our privacy. We have tried many times over the years to talk to them about issues such as dropping in unannounced, telling people around our town (1500 people) about medical issues I am having, people hearing them talk shit about my wife to other people in town and much more. When brought up they deny they say things. In the case of dropping in, they started calling as they were driving down the street. They would show up at 6:45, in the middle of bath time (we have 4 children) before bed at 7:15. \n\nMuch of this put a strain on our relationship and we started to distance our selves. We stopped going over to their house one a week, it turned more into once a month then once every few months. They would still see our kids at my oldests sporting events as we would provide them with the schedule. \n\nLast August my dad and I got into an argument where he told me I was a worthless piece of shit. We did not talk through the holidays. New Years came ( my parents anniversary) and we frankly didn’t want to see them since we just saw them at Christmas so we made other plans. My dad once again got pissed that we were not coming out to dinner and proceeded call me names, saying I have no friends, and much more. I told them they would no longer be seeing their grandkids which he proceeded to tell me their is nothing they can to to stop them.   A few sporting events passed, we didn’t stop them from saying hi to our kids. \n\nWe had just finished a 12 year battle with my oldest daughters biological father. He finally gave up custody after being behind over $10k in medical bills and child support. That battle set us back $20k in lawyer fees. My parents knew this. \n\nThen one evening around 6:30 there was a knock on our door. My wife and I were being served. We were being sued by my parents for grand parent visitation.  The papers were filed they day the adoption was final. \n\nOver the next month we spent another $6k on a lawyer only for my parents to drop the lawsuit due to something called the safe harbor act which protects against frivolous lawsuits. \n\nWe have received some letters, my mom tried to come up to one of may daughters at a local event. We lived about a mile away from them.  We sold our house and are moving to Texas on Friday to start a new chapter in our lives. \n\nThis brings me to the petty revenge. Yesterday I receive 3 emails in a email I rarely look at. It was a scheduling, cancellation and rescheduling for my parents dog to be groomed. I am not sure why I am receiving the emails but I looked back and receive them in the past. \n\nThis morning I called the groomer and cancelled the appointment. I received the notification in my email. Come Tuesday at 10:30 I will have great pleasure knowing mom mom drove about 30 minutes to get their dog groomed only to find out the appointment was cancelled. Hopefully they will not be able to fit her in. If I receive more emails in the future, I intend on cancelling those as well. \n\n\nTLDR. Relationship with my parents got ruined, they sued my wife and I for grandparent visitation and lost. I receive a confirmation for their dogs grooming apt in my email so I called and cancelled it. ",

        "text": "First post here, on phone so sorry for errors.\n\nI worked at a warehouse for one of the big cookie distributors. People would pick boxes, people stacked boxes, and the people on the forklifts made sure we had boxes. I had moved up to a forklift position which is literally called replenisher, which comes in later.\n\nHad this other replenisher, a large guy that generally put in minimal effort and would go hide and sleep sometimes during the day. We'll call him LG (lazy guy). The whole purpose of replenishing is making sure that a picker never has to go to a different part of the warehouse to get something that's on his line. \n\nWhen there was say under 6 boxes of product on a pallet he was supposed to stack those in the aisle and get a new pallet, problem was LG was too big to bend his knees or he didn't even try, he grab the corner of his forklift and swing down to try and get em sometimes but that was rarely happening. This meant product was running out constantly because LG wanted it to be completely empty so he wouldn't have to bend over.\n\nWe had numbers to hit so adding 2 minutes to a 6 minute load is a big deal. Pickers keep asking him to get the stuff before it runs out and LG tells us we are being lazy and making his job hard. I do his job frequently so I know LG is talking out his ass and I confront him. LG puffs out his chest and starts screaming at me, who do I think I am, he's worked here since it opened (which has no bearing on his work ethic) and telling me to shut up. Also threatened to meet me in the parking lot if I kept talking shit on him before LG scoots away in the forklift.\n\nLG has several arguments with the other pickers and me again about this until he finally snaps at one picker. LG bellows loud enough for the whole warehouse to hear \"we're going to talk to the manager, I can't believe you guys keep asking me to refill this shit before its empty.\" Aka \"I can't believe you keep asking me to do my job correctly.\" LG and the picker go off to talk to our bosses boss and I literally die laughing with another guy cause we both know he just fucked himself.\n\nHe literally went in there and went on a tirade about how he was working his ass off not doing his job correctly and we keep asking him to do it. I didn't hear the conversation but LG comes out looking dejected and my boss comes up and says \"dont worry about picking anymore we are gunna have you on the forklift from now on, and LG will be secondary\" \n\nNot really petty revenge but still similiar.\n\nTLDR- idiot wasn't doing his job right and walked up to the head of the warehouse to complain that we wanted him to do it right. He got demoted.",

It's very gross yes.\n\nWhat do I do? I use the head of Fred's electric razor to chisel free the encrusted and/or viscous mucus. Then place the razor back in its spot without rinsing it. It helps to keep the sink less disgusting and makes me feel better.\n\n\nTL;DR I help lubricate and maintain Fred Blogg's shaving kit in an environmentally sustainable fashion.\n\n",

        "text": "Around a year ago, me and a co-worker (Lana) started working together. She was 19 and I was 20 at the time. Now, Lana is a bit hard to become close to, she has a somewhat cold personality and is kind of selfish at times. During the school year, I was having trouble finding ways to get home so she’d offer me rides all the time. We got to know each other over the next few months through these rides and became really good friends. I eventually developed a crush on her as well.\n\nShe was driving me home one day in the winter. We got to my house and as I was walking inside, she snuck up behind me and tried to push me into a snowbank. Well, she missed and I ended up pushing her into it instead. We both had some fun with each other and I eventually went inside. A few minutes later she sends me a text that read something along the lines of “Hey, I was wondering something. Do you think we should’ve kissed back there?”. I was amazed that she’d ask me to kiss her. I told her yes and that was the start of our relationship. Now, we still work together so she told me to keep it a secret so we wouldn’t get in trouble. \n\nOver the next two weeks, we started doing things together that couples usually do. She’d come over to my house to watch movies, we’d go on long drives at night and talk about whatever, things like that. We’re around two weeks into it and I’m the happiest I’ve been in months, possibly years. One day she just stopped talking to me though. She wouldn’t respond to my messages and she was being really cold with me at work. I waited around a week and messaged her every now and then during this time but she was just ghosting me. Eventually I got fed up and asked her straight up if she still wanted to be with me or not and she told me she just wanted to be friends. Her reason was that she was scared of commitment and hated relationships.\n\nThis was all around four months ago. I felt absolutely horrible when she told me that and it caused my depression to flare up again. A few days ago I was finally feeling ready to move on until she walked into my area of work while talking to a co-worker about how she met a cute guy that she wanted to have sex with. Me and her are still friends at this point so I’m not sure if she meant to say that in front of me but I just about broke down in tears and had to hide in a bathroom for a few minutes to calm myself down. I felt like she just used me for the attention I gave her and that she didn’t care about me at all when she said that.\n\nAfter that happened I decided that I was going to be extremely petty about it and take closing shifts out of my work schedule. Closing shifts at my workplace are the worst shifts to have. We work in a kitchen and because of the nature of the job, you get extremely sweaty, greasy, and exhausted and you’re usually there until midnight. I’m usually the flexible worker and do these shifts a lot so nobody else has to but I just felt like I deserved a break from them for a few weeks. It just so happened that she was the only other one available to cover those shifts. Now she’s stuck doing these shifts for the next two weeks on a six day work week schedule. On top of that, I’m pretty much the only one that ever comes in when they’re short-staffed and night shifts usually are short-staffed. I think I’m going to be a bit too busy to come in and cover for the next two weeks though. I might be a bit too busy to answer her messages and calls too, just like she was with me.\n\nI had a really long conversation with another co-worker that she led on like me and that helped me finally get over her. We both decided that she’s not worth the effort and emotional damage. I hope one day that me and her can be close friends again because I honestly enjoyed her company but she needs to learn how to treat people right first.",

        "text": "Ok, bear with me, this might take a minute. A little backstory for context. My neighbors have younger kids that my child used to play with. We had a couple of run-ins with the kids with complaints of lying or playing too rough, nothing too serious, normal kid stuff. Back in May the wife called me to accuse my child of saying saying some pretty ridiculous stuff about their child (their kid has a history of lying, he's been called out by his own siblings for lying about our kid). We ended up getting together with the kids to work out it, where she proceeded to (try) to berate and attack my child about this stuff he allegedly said. I shut it down and essentially told the kids that they don't need to be playing together if they're going to lie about each other. \n\nFast forward to now. Neighbors haven't spoken to us since the incident. About 2 weeks ago we noticed they parked in front of our house directly underneath our basketball hoop. I initially thought they did this out of availability because our street can get full. 4 days go by, I texted her to confirm if it was her car and to politely ask her to move it back about 10 feet. She never responded. 2 days ago I finally knocked on their door to ask her to move it back some so we're able to shoot on our hoop. She said she can't. She rambles on about how the street is full and that if she moves the car they won't be able to get the moving truck in and out of the driveway (they are moving on Friday, thank goodness). I'm standing there dumbfounded at these ridiculous reasons she's giving me (there would be plenty of space to get in and out of the driveway). I asked one last time for her to move it because there are literally no other cars parked on the street  at that time. She's says \"no, I'm taking a nap right now and I can't move it\". \n\nAlright bitch, I see what you're on. Two can play that game. Guess where the husband and I parked our cars for the remainder of the week? On the street directly in front of their driveway. They currently can't get their moving truck into their driveway and have to walk all their furniture and boxes up hill to the street. Sorry not sorry. \n\nTl:dr Neighbors car was parked under our basketball hoop for roughly 3 weeks. Neighbor 'can't' move it because 1) they won't be able to get in and out of their driveway and 2) she is \"taking a nap right now\".  So my husband and I park our cars where they should be parking, in front of their house, inconveniencing them during their move today.",

        "text": "The other stories reminded me of my Dads \r\n  \r\n1st time poster ever on reddit, bare with me here\r\n\r\nBack story: My parents have worked hard their whole lives to buy their dream home in a nice upper middle class neighborhood. They bought the house from my granddad who retired from Ford as a VP, but moved in to a smaller house after my grams died. It was a dream they never thought they could afford. A beautiful 1 story home with lots of room for their grandkids to visit, which came in handy when little sister needed to move in for a short time to get her life back on track with her 2 boys. \r\n\r\n Just when my sister and her little family move in, so do the new neighbors with 4 dogs.  No worries, 4 dogs are not ideal in a neighborhood, but as long as they are well cared for, there will be no issues. The neighborhood association and city laws say 2+ dogs means they need to get a fenced in back yard, and my parents assumed they would do that at some point, but it costs money, so give them time and say nothing, even when the dogs being barking 24/7 very loudly and start showing up in the back yard of my dogless parents.\r\n\r\n1 year passes and the dogs are let outside frequently in the backyard unattended and they are animals after all so naturally they start coming into my parents yard to do their business.  Not a huge deal if their owners are responsible and clean up the brown bombs. Only they do not ever. My dad goes over and asks them to nicely clean up their dogs turds. They agree but refuse to ever come over and actually scoop the poop rendering my nephews unable to play in their yard without fear of smelly surprises on their feet or worse if they are playing and trip. \n\r\n The neighbors on the other side call the city and get their dogs picked up several times before the city issues them a citation and demands they get a fence. They pay the huge fine and get the much needed fence. My parents never said a word to the authorities and figured the fence would solve it. It didn't,  they started letting the dogs out of their front door to travel around the neighborhood. These 3 of these dogs are huge, a Great Dane, a very cute, but active Dalmatian, a German Shepard, and a tiny Yorkshire Terrier. \r\n\r\nTheir butt blows are massive. They smell as poo tends to do. It pisses my dad off more than anyone else. His Detroit upbringing begins to show. He starts shoveling the odiferous surprises off of his driveway, walkways, yard, porch, patio decking. At first he just flings the smelly things into their yard, figuring that will stop it, but when that fails he devises a brilliant idea.\r\n\r\nAs I've already stated, my dad got tired of dung in his yard so my nephews who lived there couldn't play in the yard without dodging doggy doo. My dad asked nicely 1 last time  if they could pick up the feces from my elderly parents yard, and told them my younger nephew was terrified of them after one attempted to bite him when he was ignoring the dog who wanted, nay demanded attention. The neighbor got very nasty and said they had company coming over and told my dad to stfu! They claimed the law was on their side and that their dogs were allowed to go wherever they wanted and do whatever they pleased. Oh hell no! You can take the boy out of the D, but you can't take the D out of the boy! \n\r\nMy dad started scooping up the poo in his yard and placed it on the neighbor's porch so the guests could see what they were dealing with and react just as my parent had. He had a nice little pile going right in front of the neighbor's door when the guests started to arrive. The neighbor got very upset and decided to confront my dad in front of his company as to why my dad was being “so rude!” \r\n\r\nMy dad very calmly said that he was tired of dealing with crap like the ones in front of their door, and since the neighbors refused to take care of it, he figured he would. The man tries to say that the poop was not his and suggested it was my dad's or my nephews! Talk about seeing red, my dad was pissed, he told him they don't have any animals and they would NEVER stoop to his level and leave crap for others to clean. He also knew he'd done all he could that day,  but he thought his point was made. Nope the very next day when they had no company, the dogs were back in my parents yard doing their brown business.\r\n\r\nDad decided to save up the turds, he even paid my nephews to pick up the putrid messes and pile them in the yard, my dad had a huge pile of squirts saved up, and he could've called the cops, or just flung them into their yard like most people would, but my dad is a revenge king in my book. He waited until the neighbors had a large group over then he went to work. He artfully built pyramids of brown stink on their front door,  down their walk way, and in front of each drivers side car of their guests. He flings the rest all over their front yard and then sits in his house with windows open and waits. Their party ended and the fun began. The guests were not pleased with my dad's choices, and when the neighbors tried to say they had no idea who did it, or why someone would do that, my dad calmly walked out and said to the guests “I am the one who put the crap where it was,  and I am sorry those of you who have nothing to do with this were involved, however since these people have moved here I have had to deal with their damn dogs terrorizing my grandsons and crapping on my damn lawn every damn day and they won't clean it up, so I can't use my damn yard without cleaning up after their stupid animals!” My mom nearly died right then and there in her house listening to my dad, and my sister and her boys laughed and told me about it. Now whenever the dogs leave their crap behind, and yes they still do frequently, my dad shovels it and leaves it on their door, literally ON the door! The neighbors tried to get him in trouble for it, but the cops sided with him and even fined them a few times for having their dogs put without a leash! Don't mess with a grumpy guy from Detroit with a sheriff son and nothing to loose! \r\n",

        "text": "This story is what happened when I took a risk from a rated-hot vendor advertising on the faeces-book.\n\nI saw an advert for a combined rear-view mirror / recording camera.\n\n* Display full width of mirror\n* Full touch screen\n* Slide out camerata\n* GPS\n* Extra remote rear-view camera and cable\n\nIt looked a very good deal. I'd seen the adverts for quite some time, so it looked like the seller was sticking around, if it was a scam it wasn't folding. (Note: it may have been a carousel of multiple sellers).\n\nWhat arrived was a 2 crap mirrors with a small screen behind the glass taking less than 1/3 of the size. No touch screen, just buttons around the rim. No slide out camera, no external camera, no external camera input, no GPS, no GPS input.\n\nI didn't even bother turning them on.\n\nI've been told that in the international postal union, China is considered a developing country and it's much cheaper to send goods from China than to send them back.\n\nSo the scam seems to be to misdescribe goods just enough to make the sale, as it often isn't worth paying to return goods, especially combined with the risk that \"they didn't arrive / they arrived damaged / the vendor is too stupid to work out how to refund\" is enough to make the buyer not want to throw more money at the problem due to the risk of getting nothing in return.\n\nUsually when I buy from China I get the best-gear, sometimes dang-good, even all-express delivery, because it's safer to buy from a merchant who has a good name to lose if they rip you off.\n\nBut this time I took a chance, and was depending on my \"friendly\" payment service to claw back any funds if required.\n\nI gave the merchant a chance to do the right thing, asking for an immediate refund and inviting the merchant to arrange collection of his property.\n\nAs expected, the merchant isn't responding, but I've also raised a dispute with the friendly payment provider.\n\nThe merchant responds, expressing regret that I'm not satisfied with what I bought and suggest that I return the goods to China at my expense (DHL or UPS only, claiming that they can't receive mail) so that they can consider a refund.\n\nThat's not going to happen; I ask why I need to go to further expense to fix their mistake.\n\nThey stop responding, and the dispute service ask me to return the goods and also specify the return address.\n\nDarn.\n\nSo I get to pay out some more money. \n\nBut here's the revenge: I use the mail service. Tracked and signed for. Even though the vendor says I can't, the friendly payment service makes no such restriction.\n\nMail tracking shows that the package can't be delivered and is being returned to me. Oh dear.\n\nQuick call to the payment service, as it looks like the merchant doesn't have a valid return address! (I'm sure that is a payment service requirement)\n\nI have to prove that I sent it to the address that they asked me to return it to -- which is easy to prove, and so my refund is granted while the goods are still in transit.\n\nIn a similar way I get most of the return postage costs refunded.\n\nSo now I'm down only a couple of dollars for shipping, and I still have the two crap cameras.\n\nTake that for trying to make me pay extra with DHL for returns!\n\nI've given the vendor notice that they can reimburse my final outstanding expense and arrange collection of their property.\n\nIn a week I'll give them final notice that I'll dispose of the abandoned goods to cover my expenses, and costs of disposal.\n\nI'll be obliged to send any excess to the vendor, but as the goods will be sold-as-seen bags-no-returns I doubt that they will be any excess.\n\nDL;DR: no-name Chinese merchant sends me substitute crap and stops responding. Didn't give a valid mail address for returns, so I get a refund and I've still got the goods.",

        "text": "I worked at McDonald’s as a teenager in the late 80’s. If the ice cream machine was used a bunch the ice cream was too soft to serve. I had a lady who insisted I make her a cone anyway. I’d offered her a cup instead, but she refused. I made her the cone she demanded and I intentionally made it x-large and handed it to her through the drive thru window. It immediately dumped in her lap. She wadded up a dollar and threw it at me. I got her change and threw it back at her and slammed the drive thru window shut. She sat there for a long time staring at me. I never flinched! I really thought I would get fired, but she didn’t ask for the manager. \nThis lady was the kind that would come in 3 minutes before closing and order a salad knowing it would have to be made, because we were sold out for the day. I won’t say what I did to her salad, but she taught me to never go to any restaurant within 15 minutes of closing time. \nI’ll admit I was a teenager and would act differently now, but man it felt really good at the time.

        "text": "I got abruptly laid off about three months ago. No word going around the office, no whispered warnings or writing on the wall. Office HR said that they were ‘restructuring some of the teams’ and that it was ‘an overhead decision.’ I went from sitting at my desk working on a spreadsheet to standing in the parking lot with a grocery bag full of desk items within about 10 minutes. \n\nFast forward to the beginning of July. I’m still job hunting and get email notifications / digests from all the major websites. My girlfriend and I were curled up on the couch watching a movie when my phone buzzed. It was an alert that a new job matching a few of my keyword searches had been posted.\n\nMy old company, my old job.\n\nIt’s probably worth noting that I didn’t like the job very much, and it might have shown in my attitude and (occasionally) performance. I felt like I was flailing there, but there were never any warnings, conversations, reviews, improvement plans, anything that suggested my job was on the line. I’m the type that relies on and responds to feedback, and there was absolutely nothing suggesting that I wasn’t at least meeting expectations until I was already out the door.\n\nI mulled it over, swallowed my pride, and then turned in an application along with an email to HR and my old boss telling them I’d done so.\n\nNo response.\n\nI started doing some Google research about laying people off for poor performance. Everything I found suggested that it’s a legal minefield, and from an employer’s perspective, it’s pretty much always best to start leaving a paper trail before terminating a single employee.\n\nThis week, I emailed again with a few more questions. I asked how many employees had been laid off, what the process was to determine which jobs to eliminate, whether any of those jobs were being refilled, and if there were any changes to the position as currently posted that didn’t make me a viable candidate.\n\nI haven’t gotten a response, but the job posting had disappeared from the Internet when I checked again the next day.\n\nTbh I don’t even want the job back and don’t have any plans to pursue legal action. I just wanted to razz them about it a little. It’s so petty that I’m not even proud of it. \n\n…mostly.",

        "text": "Believe somewhere in the mid 2000’s (honestly I’m guessing, it’s been a long time). I bought a new cell phone and it came with a new number. This was before you could port your number and take it with you. The number that I received must have belonged to the most popular 16-20 aged girl in the world. I would get calls for her all day, every day. Worse, I explained this is no longer her number, but the same people would never update their address book, a few days later would call back again.\n\nI’d remind them after the third or forth plus time. I even tried getting nasty to see if that would work.  Example of this would be “If it was the wrong number on last Tuesday then Thursday what makes you think it’s the right number today? That’s not how phones work”. I’d try all sorts of things like this to deter them from calling. But honestly I think they did it on purpose like they were getting a kick out of it.\n\nA couple calls it’s no big deal. But I was receiving constant, daily calls. They never stopped.\n\nThis went on for about a month, no change. I was at my wits end, it was torture at this point telling the same story for 95% of my phone calls. I’m not a fan about being strong armed. I’m not heading back to the store to get a new number then updating everyone with yet another new number. So I tried a new approach.\n\nWhenever someone would call for her I would say “She’s a little (long pause)… tied up right now.” Any opportunity for sudden innuendo I took. People would awkwardly excuse themselves and tell me they would call back later, but the best part? Most didn’t. Those who did, I played the role of the “Who dis!?”  Angry Ganksta boyfriend the best I could with like the three Ebonics words I knew that were most likely ten years out of date at this point. After speaking with Angry Gansta boyfriend they wanted nothing to do with my number, perfect.  At times it was challenging to get through the conversations without breaking character or laughing.\n\nThis went on for a week or two, then the mother of the previous owner called.  She asked for her. I said my new line “tied up, etc.” she laughed her ass off. She told me she was her mother. I explained the situation and the hell I’ve been through getting the phone to stop ringing, the late night wake ups and the repeat offenders. I said this is the only thing that seems to have made a dent.\n\nShe laughed more, told me she would tell her daughter to let her friends know she has a new number and I thought that was that.  If it was I wouldn’t be writing this.\n\nCouple days later I get a call. Here it was the previous owner now, she asks for herself. I gave her my tied up line and she went nuclear on me. I sat there and took it, didn’t say anything and let her finish.\n\nI then explained calmly the situation. Nothing seemed to work so I begin trying this. So far it’s had the best results, I haven’t had any repeat offenders. Much appreciated if you could let everyone know you have a number.\n\nShe demanded I get a new number. I told her no, she can let everyone know her new number and that would resolve everything. I mean, don’t you want these people to get a hold of you? This logic for whatever reason pissed her off.\n\nWhat followed was mostly incoherent yelling. But all that I got from it was for me to get a new number. I could tell she was a person of principle and wasn’t going to budge. I changed my tune.  I said, why would I do that? I like your friends and they like me too! They really enjoy our stories.  The thing you do with pop rocks, or better yet the time we had to go to the ER because something got “stuck” they love that one.  For the record I never said such things but I was going to moving forward.\n\nThere was a loud scream and then cut off. I think she smashed her phone. Fast forward four years later, from that day forth I had only received one call for her. I assume an old friend that lost touch.  I laughed because I forgot and told him wrong number.\n\nPetty but looking back It's integrated in to my legacy, lol.",
