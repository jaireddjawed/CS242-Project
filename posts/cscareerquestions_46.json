My european counterparts seem more autonomous and communicative. Overall I trust the european swe much more than the americans. If it is the quiet quitting movement, the swe job responsibilities is more than just making bad code so they're litterally not doing their job. Idk what to make of it, it's just so annoying, obviously each member of the team get the same consequences if the project fails. I can clearly point out that the americans are causing most of the delays. I'll probably just let it be and look for another job though. What would you do instead ?",

If they don’t, I’m also afraid that I’ll be less likely to receive a full-time offer for new grad which is important to me cause this is my last internship. \nWorking at Atlassian seems cool tho and they have great WLB, and also they allow new grads to work remotely. New grad TC is higher. It’s more well known in tech than JPMorgan.\n\nBut JPMorgan is more stable, and I’ve heard basically everyone gets return offers and I would like to chill my senior year. Also great WLB, and they have an office in a location I like. But lower new grad TC. Heard their tech stack isn’t as modern? and a lot of interns work with legacy code. I would also be burning a bridge if I reneged, and tbh with how things are rn idk if this would be a smart idea.\n\nIf anyone has any advice, please let me know. Thanks so much!",

To be short, I totally want to stay there for a long term. \n\nThey wanted to hire me full time last October but were unable to do that due to a hiring freeze. This was after completing all rounds of discussions. So, they have asked me to join one of their vendors (lets call it ABC) and continue working for them until the hiring resumes. I verbally agreed to it. \n\nCurrent TC: 10 LPA (12.2k USD)\nOffer from ABC: 15 LPA (18.2 USD)\nOffer X will give when hiring resumes: 16-18 LPA\n\n\nBut recently, I got an offer from a different company T. They are willing to offer 20LPA. I am thinking of accepting T because I could very much use some extra money now. \n\nNow, how do I reach out to my manager and team lead from X and tell them that I wanted to leave because I have a better offer without burning the bridges. \n\nNote: I am a Backend Developer with 4 YOE. The pay might seem very less in USD but it’s good enough to lead a comfortable life in India. (A 4bhk house only costs 35Lakhs where I live).",

I did a little programming in school, I had to program a microcontroller in the assembly language, which I thought was pretty outdated.\n\nRight now I work for a small engineering company as a technician and just trying to figure out what to do next because this level has a pretty low ceiling of opportunities.  I was thinking of maybe trying to switch over to the software engineering side of my company, most especially because they have a developer over there that is trying to retire in about a year or so and I wanted to see if I could replace him.  Problem is my degree only had one semester worth of programming, and it was for a language barely anybody uses.  But the important thing is I got a general idea of what programming is like and how to use an IDE and interface with a microcontroller.\n\nI have a family and don't really have the time or money to go back to school, so I was wondering if I could spend the next year or so learning some languages and building a project or two to show my employer, to maybe convince them to move me over to the software side of our products.  I don't know what languages they use, probably C and something else like Java I am guessing; I am going to try to find out later this week.\n\nI guess my question is how far I can get with an associate's that's only kind of related to computer science.  If I can convince my company to let me get into the software development side of things, that should put enough experience under my belt where I shouldn't need to pursue a bachelor's in computer science, right?",

        "text": "So I'm a recent grad (Dec 2022), and I have some decent Data Science experience having had 5 internships in the sustainability space working in a couple of Venture-backed startups, Government, and Academic Research. I'm not the most experienced Data Scientist out there but I would consider myself a little more experienced than your average new grad having done a lot of analysis, modeling, and data engineering work with some very experienced data scientists across different subject areas.\n\nAs I was interviewing I decided that I wanted to stick in a specific space in sustainability so I found a local company (150 employees) that does very software-heavy consulting in the space for a lot of F50 companies. I was very excited as these guys seemed to be experts in this space so I would learn a lot of modeling and subject matter expertise. I started this last week and after the first day I got home and I wanted to sob my eyes out because this org was worse than I could've imagined. I told myself I'd spend at least a few weeks learning and observing before making a judgment but what I've seen this week has me scared.\n\nAs far as I can tell, this is a very top-down org, with way too many middle managers. The CTO helped found the company many years ago and has a forestry background and acts more like head of IT instead of CTO. They religiously use enterprise software from Microsoft (ok preference whatever). They require you to install monitoring software on your personal cell phone that can access everything so you can use teams (I said fuck it and didn't get teams on my phone). These were surprising but I said okay fine. At the end of the day they are a consulting org that is trying to turn into a technology company. There are a lot of signs that they are trying to work towards change but they just don't know what they don't know.\n\nOn the actual tech side, things are a nightmare. Out of 20 or so IC developers, there is only one that is a senior and he had a year of experience there and was straight out of a PhD in a natural science field. They split folks up into developers and analysts, developers work in Javascript and python while analysts work in excel. Very few of the developers actually have CS experience, they are mostly econ backgrounds. My official title is Data Scientist after I refused the Developer/Analyst title they initially offered me. Come to find out my first week all of the ICs are fresh out of school with no real production experience and it shows: secrets committed in git, stuff being hardcoded in not used in env variables, not following any paradigms at all (no oop, no functional, no procedural programming just spaghetti), no real code reviews or quality control, doing Reinforcement Learning models in excel (more impressive than anything), Data isn't versioned, experiments aren't logged, almost no documentation anywhere for technical architecture or decisions. All of the heads of 'development' or managers of the developers are subject matter experts (albeit very very good at this subject matter) and they are the ones that do code reviews hence the messes. Again there are signs they are trying to do better but they don't know what they don't know.\n\nI was talking to the PM that was onboarding me and he said something along the lines of: \"I'm very happy that we have you so we can finally start doing things the right way\". I don't know how I didn't catch this interviewing but I somehow didn't.\n\nI'm not really sure what to do, because I really care about this subject area and I have an opportunity here to be the 'founder' of the Data Science team and push this culture; but jesus christ I cannot be the one to do the work of a Senior Engineering Manager or VP of engineering because for 1 I'm not qualified, I know that a lot of these things need to be done and how they should be done but I don't have 5+ years of experience that they need at a minimum for this. Do you think I should stick it out since the market is bad and try to learn as much as I can with the risk of reducing my own tech standards and becoming complacent plus not getting any real mentorship or should I run for the hills immediately?",

So you aren't sure if there's something wrong with the request, the data or the environment itself. Not even to mention that there are \"special cases\", like if a user is from \\[random\\_country\\] and I broke the dev environment for a day because, how was I supposed to know that if nobody told me? Am I just supposed to ask for every flipping restriction that could possibly occur, given that I'm relatively new to the product and my domain knowledge kinda sucks?\n\nI also have to complete a CVE training in the upcoming weeks and I've had 11 attempts total (3 at a time and they refresh every 5 days) with only coming close (within 1-2 points) to the target score twice. \n\nI struggle, really.

The company is going to match me with an apprenticeship position that will last 12-15 months. It could be in software development, help desk, system admin, cybersecurity, etc. They are connected with companies in cities across the US. \n\nWhat I’m working on: While I wait to get set up with interviews, I have been crafting my own “computer science curriculum.” The program I took was a good intro, but I want to learn more. I found a software engineer online who told exactly what courses he took in undergrad. So I went to Coursera and enrolled in some of them to start. I know employers prefer to see undergrad degrees in CS but it doesn’t make sense for me. I already did the 4 year degree thing. This way I’m just focusing on the “meat and potatoes” for much less money.\n\nAbout me: I am open to moving. I want to do my apprenticeship in person rather than remote because I want to have a lot of handle holding and questions answered when I start. After that, I’d like to go remote. I’m frugal, single, pet-less, childless, have a decent amount saved. I don’t drink or do drugs. I don’t mind living in a studio apartment the size of a shoebox with two lawn chairs as furniture (less to clean). I like warm weather, the beach, swimming, running, hiking. I’d rather live around senior citizens than young singles/college kids/families with kids.\n\nSo what state should I get started in? I’ve been thinking California but there are so many cities there I don’t know where to start? Or is it oversaturated with too many wannabe techies?",

My job was to maintain a web app, add new features, fix bugs, and help with the development of a yet-to-be-released mobile app.\n\nA few weeks into the job, I learned that the senior developer was quitting, and I was scared because I had never worked as a software developer before. But I threw myself into the work, reading the codebase and learning as much as I could about Laravel and PHP. To my surprise, I was able to implement new features and impress my boss.\n\nRecently, my boss approached me about working on a metaverse project, but I'm not sure if that's something I want to take on. I'm still a junior developer and I don't want to take on more than I can handle. I'm not sure what to do, should I quit my job or try to find a way to explain my concerns to my boss?",

I just started working for our company (Government position) one year ago. \n\nDuring my biweekly 1 on 1 with the supervisor, he asked if there’s something that I wanted to talk about and I asked if he has any feedback for me. He said No and to just continue working with TL for knowledge transfer and getting me all caught up. I know, ive been working here for a year and I still don’t feel like I have all the company knowledge needed to mostly independently which is very frustrating.\n\nI wanted to tell the supervisor during 1 on 1 meeting how the TL and I don’t even interact and there’s no knowledge transfer going on. I would go to her to ask her for questions or new projects or take on more work, but she’s very dismissive , rude, and been creating a hostile work environment for me to the point where I’ve been dreading going to work everyday. \n\nI really love my job but I was at the point where I could not take it anymore so I decided to email our supervisor explaining how the TL has been treating me on Friday. This was the very last step for me as I don’t know what else to do. It’s either something improves or I’ll have to leave. I wanted to make sure first that I’ve done everything I can before throwing in the towel. I’ve tried asking her before if she has any issues with me that I can address or change. She just said “no. This is not something I’m going to discuss with you”\n\nIn my email, I explained to the supervisor what has been happening and how the TL has been treating me. I have been documenting my interactions with her as well. I know she’s a very busy person and I try not to bother her as much, but the weird thing is that when I ask our other team members for help (they’ve all been there for 5 yrs+… I’m the youngest and newest member in our team)…they would help me but would tell me not to tell TL that they’ve been helping me because “she wouldn’t like that”. There was also an instance where TL was making me do something and I was really confused with what she wanted me to do… I took it as just me lacking the knowledge and me being dumb. So I asked another team member for help and even her was confused… so she went to another team member asking the question and we realised that I wasn’t supposed to be doing what the TL was asking me to do as it is the DBAs job and we don’t have access to it. \n\nI don’t think she treats the other team members like the way she treats me. They’re all in their early 40’s including the TL while I’m in my early 20’s. I know I still lack the experience and some knowledge but I’ve been working for almost 9 yrs… I’ve been working since I was 15 yrs old in various organisations and this is not my first “professional” job. I have never been treated like this before in those years. \n\nI’m really scared to come in to work tomorrow (Monday). \n\nAny advise, insights , or what to prepare for if my supervisor calls me in to his office tomorrow would be appreciated.

        "text": "**Hey everyone.** **In 2020, I made a pivot into web development and taught myself how to code in React and Javascript. In 2021 I was hired at a Big4 Consultancy firm as a Jr. Web Developer, and I was very clear that my background was in web development and I preferred to code in web-based frameworks.**\n\nThree months into my tenure at the consultancy firm, I was put on a Swift/UIkit project. I didn’t have experience in Swift or UIKit but I was super excited to learn how to create iOs apps. Our tech lead ended up taking vacation and the only other iOS developer on the team was another jr developer who had experience coding in UIKit. This project was ROUGH for me. I had to learn on the spot how to code in UIKit, SwiftUi and MVVM architecture. The client was also difficult and the project had a reputation in the firm for being poorly managed — when the project ended, the feedback for me was that I had a lot to learn. I was told by other leaders in our firm that the project should have never been staffed with only two junior iOS developers and the manager running the project was warned not to. \n\nWhen the project ended, I took the time to learn Swift by building my own projects and following code alongs via Udemy. Because this is a consultancy project, I get staffed on other projects where I take on a functional role rather than a technical one, and I do really well - even getting an award for my performance. My daily schedule looks like: between 9-6 PM, I work on my functional project, then from 6 PM onwards I’m practicing Swift. \n\nAbout a year later I get staffed on a SwiftUI project. I’m the least experienced developer on the project with about 4 months of actual “technical” work experience under my belt. There’s a lot of things that are new to me, like resolving merge conflicts and brand new concepts like making fetch requests and parsing data objects from the backend. \n\nI told our tech lead I didn’t have a ton of experience and in the middle of our very first sprint, our tech lead tells all of upper management that I have a lot of gaps in my knowledge and “will destroy the whole thing”. My tech lead specifically tells me that he does not have capacity to answer any of my questions, and every phone call with him where I ask him to help me debug something turns into a beat down session where my intelligence is being questioned.\n\nMid-way through the project, meetings are set up with me to discuss my performance. I’m told I don’t communicate enough and that there are severe technical gaps in my knowledge. \n\nI dedicate myself to getting better. I practice ALL the time, and I start getting my tickets in before the sprint ends. UI tickets, MVVM, creating mock objects and parsing — they all become a breeze to me. I still haven’t worked on making fetch requests yet but I’m feeling more confident about my knowledge. \n\nThe feedback from my tech lead moves away from being “she doesn’t know anything” to “she’s “copying everyone else’s code and doesn’t understand what she’s doing” — I’m like whatever, everyone else on the project is telling me that I’ve improved so much so much and I only ask this tech lead for help when it’s an emergency. He’s still saying things to me like I’m not as good as \\_\\_\\_\\_ developer on the project, I’m not good enough to be there, etc. He would take days to approve my PRs (while approving everyone else’s) and also merged one of my tickets into a previous sprint branch and blamed me for it. \n\nI get my first ticket where I need to make a request to the B/E and I’m struggling. Not because I didn’t set up the fetch request correctly, but because even though my fetch was making a request, I kept getting a “mismatch” error and couldn’t figure out why. I reached out to the B/E end team and they said it wasn’t an issue on their end, I pulled in every developer I knew to help me debug, and I raised to our product manager. I also discussed it every morning during standup.\n\nIt turned out to be a B/E issue and my ticket was blocked. My tech lead told me to try a different approach, which I spent the entire sprint implementing, and turns out that there was ALSO a B/E issue with that approach (which my tech lead never updated me about until the last day of the sprint).\n\nI got rolled off the project for bad performance and not communicating enough. I feel like I’m going to get fired, and everyone tells me that I didn’t do enough. Our senior manager told my coach that I improved but then regressed. \n\nThe developers who work close to me spoke up about my improvements and performances. They were told not to continue advocating for me and were told that if they continued to advocate for me then they “would be next”\n\nThe project was also poorly run, had a reputation for being toxic, literally everyday there’s a session where one developer is pointing the finger at another and blaming them for a bug. Tickets are not clear and ACs are not properly defined… I’m glad I was rolled off the project because I’ve never cried and thrown up from anxiety so much in my life but I feel so valueless and broken. Aside from the developers I work with, everyone thinks I can’t code when I’ve gotten so much better.",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm a computer science student in Melbourne. I'm in my second year this year. I have been working on a medical research project as well as have an internship as a quantitative analyst. \n\nI am visiting India right now and everyone I talk to is either doing computer science or IT. My uncle is saying that software engineering is going to be super saturated and offshored from Australia to India. I can't help but feel doubtful and scared about my career in the future. \n\nI'm thinking maybe I should switch to some other engineering like electrical or maybe even mechanical. \n\nI really do enjoy coding and maths. But I also want to ensure my career is stable and I can find employment with enough pay.",
