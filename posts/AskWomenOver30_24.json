No one was on my side, other than I was being gaslit by close friends who'd rather me be abused than to cut everyone off to protect my mental health.\n\nBasically, guy in a long distance relationship decided I'd be a fun game for him to play with and messed with my head. I initially lied about his age in a previous post to protect him, but frankly, he doesn't deserve it. \n\nHe made me feel important and protected, until he didn't. I will admit, I knew since day 1 that he was bad news. Just one of those things your gut tells you after being abused for so many years. But he was always kind to me and in the server, he seemed genuinely caring to everyone.\n\nThen there came the subtle cues that I saw of how he was treating me, he was really stupid about that. \n\n\"You have a worldliness about you\" = \"You're so mature for your age (because you grew up suburban)\"\n\nAnd then there's how when I told him I didn't want to be a homewrecker, his response? \n\n\"I wouldn't let you\" vs \"you're not\" are two very different words. You can guess for yourself which one he picked.\n\nTldr: guy was trying to groom me.funny thing is, if he cut the creep shit, I would've been genuinely interested in a relationship.",

I requested him to provide me with some ID before meeting again. He refused to send this over. He said he wouldn’t give me a copy of it but he could “show me” over lunch. When I ended things, he then escalated his bevahiour - sending me “999” texts and harassing me accusing me of being irrational. It was terrifying receiving endless messages from him. I ended up calling the police because he knows my apartment, the exact floor I live on despite never revealing this and my walking routine to work: I walk at 6am in the pitch black dark. I don’t know if I’m in the wrong but something feels off and I feel worried and jittery about my welfare. Police are currently conducting a background check on him and my nerves are shot to pieces thinking the worst. Am I in the wrong? How to navigate from here onwards?",

She's coloured her hair my whole life and only recently started trying to blend her greys into her black hair. Her skin is flawless but has some very minor fine lines and it crinkles like tissue paper around her eyes when she smiles, but she feels she has old lady hands (she does not) and talks about her wrinkles.\n\nI can tell she is upset that she is aging. She makes comments, she's hurt very easily around the topic, she's trying to lose weight. She's in good, functional shape and incredible health but she has lived her whole life like some of us do (me included), always wanting to be a little bit thinner/stronger/\"more toned\", and I think she's struggling coming to terms with \"being older\" and those goals slipping out of her grasp a bit because it's a little harder, she has injuries now, she just can't do what she could at 30.\n\nHow did you get comfortable with aging? Do you still fight it? Do you just do your thing and don't pay much attention to it? How do you preserve feeling feminine post-menopause? How do you nurture your self-confidence when you can't physically do the things you could previously do?\n\nAnd any tips for a daughter who wants to support her mom in getting comfortable being older? Any new activities that you discovered you enjoyed when you couldn't do things you used to do in younger years?",

I didn't notice anything different the last time we met. The only clue I can see, in hindsight, is that all our last meetings were initiated by me. \n\nAnyway now I'm crying all day at work, I have to return her birthday presents that I bought with so much care. I feel like a fool for not seeing the signs, and realising that I have a lot of traits that make me difficult and not the perfect friend. I also realised suddenly that my  little circle of friends that were so important for me is gone (one moved to the other side of the country, one distanced herself gradually, one is turning very religious and her values are getting very incompatible with mine). I got a promotion and I've got no one to tell, at least nobody that matters. \n\nI guess I should pull myself together and meet new people. It's seriously not so easy to make friends as an adult, especially when your time is devoted to a demanding job and kids. Also it takes a ridiculously long time to get that close to someone. I already have social hobbies that I really love, I like the people there but there's nobody that I really clicked with, and the ones that I did ended leaving this stupid city. \n\nRant over, thanks for listening.",

But I desperately need a change of scenery for at least 2-5 years. To reset and move forward. I’ve desired this for YEARS. \n\nMy ex who I loved very deeply hurt me horrifically. He was emotionally abusive, lied, cheated, had a baby during our timeline and I now hear married. Lol, months after we split. I am shaken to my core and even though it’s been a year now I just feel shaken by it all. Even worse he is spreading lies and people I confided in are gossiping and spreading rumours about me without knowing the full story. My ex got the happy ending that we once planned for. No justice for me once again. Being a good person doesn’t pay off you know? Friends I thought I could trust have betrayed me. Everyone has been cut off and I’m working on myself in therapy but some days I just feel defeated. \n\nWork is overall fine. I like my job and manager but the working environment when I’m in the office drains my spirit. I’m applying for new jobs but no success so far. I’m staying to pay off this last debt then start afresh financially (a lot of money went last year when my one of my parents got sick / family stuff so I helped out but live alone). It took me to zero savings and I’ve been paying off debt some my parents and mine for months now. This month I’ll finally be debt free! \n\nI turn thirty soon and I know I’ve been doing all I can to change my circumstances but nothing seems to be working. So if I need to stay in my country, stay in this job, process this pain from my ex - what is really next for me? I can’t seem to create a plan to look forward to as plan be. I have full intentions to continue apply to jobs and relocating but if that doesn’t work life must continue and I must move on. I just don’t know how to get excited for a plan b in case plan a doesn’t work out. What is even this plan b? Stuck where I am working. I hope this make sense. \n\nAny advice, please?",

Before he left he told me twice he will come back on date X, but he also mentioned that he was considering taking another short trip after his family's visit (he didn't discuss how probable and how long that might be, it's regarding one of his hobbies). \n\nThe next day after he left, it turned out my dog needs to have a major surgery and I specifically booked the date after the initial day my partner was supposed to be back. First because I don't drive and my dog might need a transport back home after the anesthesia and second because I didn't want to be alone, cause I'm very nervous.\n\nI told my partner when's the surgery but we didn't discuss anything further. I mean, I didn't tell him specifically that it would be nice for him to be here, because... I thought he will be, knowing how difficult this is for me and also because before he left, he'd already said when he plans to return (without hypothetically extending the trip to do the other stuff about his hobby).\n\nToday I asked him if he's going to be back on that X date, since I was wondering if he could help me with transportation in case my dog can't walk after the surgery and he said he'd decided to extend the vacation and plans to travel to another place to hang out (as he had already mentioned before) and he will be back a couple of days later.\n\nI felt very disappointed at his change of plans and also that he informed me only after I specifically asked him. I told him I would feel much better if he was here, knowing I can rely on him even for emotional support and I didn't think he would extend his trip after I told him about the surgery.\nHe said he mentioned before he left that he wanted to do this extended part of the trip and he's sorry he hasn't made it more clear. And that was it. \nHis cold response and lack if empathy  struck me even more.\n\nI feel so upset about this. In my world, partners should be there for each other in times of need. I myself would never prefer to do my hobby when I know my partner feels uneasy and might need me in any way.\nBut that's just me, right now I can't decide how big of a dealbreaker this is.\nShould I have told him specifically that I need him here, without assuming he would be, because in my opinion  that's what partners normally do?\nWhat do you guys think?",

He’s from a large family with 2 siblings and close to mom and dad, as well as grandparents and aunts + uncles. While I have a large family, my parents have been divorced since I was a baby so I’m not close at all with my dad and his side of the family.  My mom suffers from depression and while we’ve tried to help, she’s pushed us all away.  The rest of my family on that side is close but we’re all spread out across the country - we chat and FaceTime often and I do feel like my husband has gained some closeness with my siblings as well as cousins, my grandparents and aunts and uncles.  We spend way more time with his family since they’re all nearby for the most part. He’s been asking more and more about my family and I try to share as many things as well as memories as I can - even the negative - but I feel like he feels that we’re too detached.  I’ve been trying to plan things for my family to come together and it’s been tough as well as disappointing. Now that we’re trying to start a family, I’d love to see things change and also give my husband a chance to feel closer to everyone too.  But where in the world do I start? My therapist had recommended family counseling with my mom and her siblings as well as my grandparents but she’s refused and drawn further away so my grandmother and aunts have been more of my maternal support lately.",

After my most recent break up, I took a long hard look at myself and realized that I had spent my 20's pining over, actively pursuing or wishing to pursue men. I did some rough mental math and the results told me that the amount of time and energy I had sunk in the pursuit of romantic love was too damn high! Obviously hindsight is 20-20, but I can't imagine how much more productive I would have been had I invested all that energy into myself. \n\nI'm not lamenting lost time or villinazing romantic love, but it did get me thinking, why do I feel like I need it to live a full life? As a child-free woman, I have had to explain ad nauseum to people that I am and will be perfectly content with a life that does not involve any child rearing activities. The societal pressure to be a mom has always been present but long ago I determined it was not a priority in my life. I want to do the same with romantic love because I feel like it keeps clouding and influencing my behaviors (ex. doing x, y and z so I'll be a good partner) and I'm sick of it! \n\nI want to focus on me but I am having trouble embracing other types of love (think \"triangular theory of love\") because of the constant pressure to be in a relationship that comes from movies, tv, books, music and so much else. So, my question is, to those who have deprioritized romantic love in their lives, how have you done it and what tips would you give me? \n\nThanks!",

He got a new job three months ago or so. \n\nWe both work from home full time but I rarely see him actually working. \n\nHis usual routine is that he logs on in the morning around 8 AM and then goes back to sleep. Then wakes up around 9:30-10:30 and showers. By the time he’s done showering and getting ready, it’s 11:30 AM. He then spends most of the remainder of the day watching videos on his phone and sitting on the couch. I’ve seen him work at most 2, maybe 3 hours at a time and that is RARE. \n\nIt honestly bothers me because I spend most of the day working and I just see him sitting on the couch (we both have our work stations in the living room bc the apartment is small). I definitely have slow days where I can just lounge but it’s not nearly as much as him. \n\nI was wondering if it was because of the job, maybe because he’s new, he doesn’t have that much work to do. However, he was this way at his other job, which he got fired from for lack of performance. If he had to go into an office, there’s no way he could get away with just sitting there on his phone. \n\nI have brought it up to him and I’m always asking him, “don’t you have any work to do?” He response is usually “not really” or “a little bit but I’ll do it later.” He tells me that he’s doing fine at his job and I have nothing to worry about. \n\nWould that bother you or am I just being dramatic?",

It was the latest of a string of 3/4 relationships of about the same amount of time, one right after the other, in the last year. Two of them were flat out abusive. The others were just not right for me. \n\nI’m realizing just how much I’ll put up with to find “love”. I’ll tolerate really bad behavior for a long time. I’ll over give and I’ll make excuses to keep them. Even at the expense of my happiness. And each time one of them ends I get right back on the dating apps, thinking somehow this time will be different. \n\nI do work with a therapist, and I have started to work with one again after this most recent relationship ending. \n\nI feel particularly unworthy and undeserving of love after this one. Like I wasn’t good enough or my mistakes and who I am just isn’t good enough for someone amazing. And the thing is - this guy wasn’t even that amazing. He was intermittently available, at times disrespectful and condescending even. He emphasized sex over my emotional well being at my expense. Just to name a few things. I’m telling myself he was amazing because he is handsome and has a great career and lots going for him. But he was emotionally neglecting me. And I allowed it even though I knew deep down he was not the one. I knew there was a reason some of his behaviors felt off. And yet I kept trying to convince him to love me. I kept performing for his love. He couldn’t meet my needs at all and I kept asking him to. \n\nI see red flags and almost take it as a challenge to convince someone to like me. I need their approval. \n\nI can’t keep living like this. Something has to change for me to lead a happy healthy life and eventually enter a healthy relationship with someone who actually likes me. \n\nWho else experiences this?

I'm mostly posting here looking for reassurance. In the past month I had 2x severe migraines with aura. Was really scary and debilitated me for the day. I've been on the combo birth control pill since I was 19 (I'm 30 now), and my doctor is having me change to the mini pill (progesterone only) because of the contraindication of the combo pill + migraines. She first suggested an IUD but I don't know if I'd be able to do that unless I could be sedated. \n\nMaybe this is a dumb question, but is the mini pill still somewhat effective? My doctor said its not as effective as the combo pill and has a higher failure rate, so she suggested pairing with another form of birth control. Would that HAVE to be condoms, or could I use the pull out method as another measure? \n\nI'm also worried about the possibility of not getting a period?? Like if its less effective for pregnancy, but you don't get a period, how do you know if you're pregnant? In some ways I will miss having a period if this is a true side effect :(\n\nMy partner and I do want to have kids, but I don't have the job security right now and want to wait to start a family. The thought of getting pregnant right now is stressful because I'm only in a temp job, but I do think I eventually want kids. Most of my friends have started their families in their 20s, so I feel like I have no one to relate to or ask about this :(. \n\nChanging medications is stressing me out way more than I thought it would. I know ppl will probably suggest an IUD and my doctor did put a referral to a gyno who may be able to discuss anesthesia options but I don't think that's a guarantee. In any case I won't be able to see gyno until 7 months anyway so I need something other than the combo pill in the mean time. \n\nTLDR: Is there any reassurance anyone can provide me with changing birth controls? I didn't realize it would be this stressful.",

Sorry, no he needed to figure out who he was after his dad died and wasn’t in the right mindset to be in a relationship anymore. (Insert heavy sigh and eye-roll) As you might guess, I’m fairly bitter about this.\n\nSince learning he was talking to this younger woman while we were together, before his dad even died, I’ve been reflecting on what our relationship was like and all the passes I gave him. \n\nOver the years I was very clear with my needs and was open about compromising if he didn’t feel he could meet them. Except 7 out of 10 times he would either a) tell me what I wanted to hear but never make changes or b) turn it on me to the point I felt guilty about bringing it up and needed to comfort him for making him feel like crap. Then the last couple years, he started being distant during sex to the point I would stop in the midst and tell him that I felt like I was just being used. He would get sad and once again, I was there comforting him. This morphed into comments that made me feel like he was only interested in my body and didn’t actually see me anymore. Then right before he left, he had a dream I was pregnant. After telling me this dream, he went out and bought a pregnancy test for me. When I said it was just a dream and counted I was pregnant, he came at me with “just take it. I would know if you were pregnant before you would. I know your body better.” \n\nFvcking hell. Just typing this out out makes me cringe. The audacity I had to stay with him. It annoys me to no end I still having feelings for him because it wasn’t always like this. But damn, do I wish I had the awareness I have now back when things started getting rough. I see now I shouldn’t have stayed and normalized his behaviors.\n\nAny one else have reflections of their past relationships where you wish you knew that sooner?",

        "text": "For reference, I'm in western Europe, so possibly different than the US. Anywho, I re-entered the workforce after being a sahm for 14 years. I feel like it's going relatively well, I've picked it up fast and had positive feedback (financial sector), but I'm more the age of my bosses or people that have been there a couple decades or both. I feel a bit like I'm being othered. There's an early 20s something that started not long before me in a slightly different role and so far I've heard her say something about a mentoring program, someone ask her if she's interested in a supervisory role eventually or specialising and I got asked today if I'd be interested in a work from home customer service role. Ummmm, no, I just got out of my damn house. Why would I want to go back in? Plus, I've been there done that, I hate call centre work. I have a 4 year degree, managerial and financial work experience, more than the other woman has.   I'm trying not to feel like it's ageism, as in they're only interested in developing the younger employees, but that's what it seems like. Has anyone else experienced this? How can I combat this without creating a shit storm? I'm a contract employee also so can't really make waves if I want to stay on. Which I'm not even sure I want anymore if I can't progress and earn more. Any pointers would be useful.",

        "text": "Hi guys! It's been a while, I think xD, I made this post because I'm feeling tired and I don't know if sad would be the correct word, but it's very close.  \nIf you had any of my posts before then you should know by now that I've been struggling with being touched and emotionally starved, alongside dealing with insecurities as a man like being extremely short (5\"3), and so on and so on.\n\nI actually would say that I feel better compared to previous months! I still don't like myself, but I've come to terms with being alone at the moment, being deprived and such, I've grown so much (mentally of course, not physically xD) over the last few months.\n\nFor example, when I discovered the self-improvement movement a couple of months ago at first I was happy because I could see myself getting better and such, but as time passed I still feel bad, worse actually, at the moment I didn't know why, but I know. It's because of my ego, I didn't understand why I had to work so much and so hard in order to get the minimum attention from other people (women mostly), I was hurt, I would see all of these other men that definitely aren't in the self-improvement movement, they were more like me, they were being themselves like people always tell you to be and they were being loved and respected and cared for, unlike me who seemed to be so left behind by default.\n\nI recently realized this and I feel a lot better because of it actually, and I've also been checking more women-oriented subs, which honestly seem to be more mature and helpful than general self-help subs, (in my opinion of course, it's just that the answers seem to be more mature and proactive)\n\nSo in summary, I still have long ways to go in this loving myself journey thing, and although I'm making progress, there are still moments like today when I'm feeling tired and bummed out, and overwhelmed and I would like to know if you had any type of advice, tip or something like that for feeling better! Thank you so much for reading, truth is that I mostly wrote this to let out my thoughts and such.",

I do it to both people that I’m friends with and people  I’m romantically interested in. The obsession can last anything from a few weeks, months or even years and it takes something drastic to happen in order for me to percieve them as normal again. In the past that was usually them liking someone that in my eyes was really avarage but there were times when even that wasn’t enough and they had to do something that went completly against my morals. Once the fixation ends I am crushed either because they remind me of how I couldn’t control my life or simply because they can’t compare to my idolezed version of them. This normally happens around 6 months after I move on from my last “victim” with people I don’t know much about but enough to create an idea of them.\n\nI’m asking for help because at the start of January I passed a guy on the hallway that has since become the main reason I even come to school. Typically I’d just wait for him to save me from this by either getting a girlfriend or doing something really problematic. The thing is I can’t because 1) he already has a girlfriend and 2) he isn’t problematic at all (we also don’t hang out, have classes together or follow each other on social media so the 1% chance of him fucking up is 0% since I can’t see him do it).\n\nI’m BEGGING for any kind of advice not only because he is in a relationship but also because I’m tired of not being able to be in control of my own life for more than 6 months.

        "text": "Long story short, last year my previous company was acquired by my current company. I was hesitant to stay and found a new job with a Senior title. My ex boss that I have a great relationship with begged me to stay and help me found a new job in dept A. In the negotiation process, I asked them to match the senior title of the job offer I get. The boss of dept A made up some excuses of my seniority in the dept and promised a review in 6 months ( lesson learned). Since then, the boss of dept A now moved on to dept B and recruited her friend to become the new boss of dept A. \n\nSoon I realized I do not want to work for the new boss because he always randomly drag me into politics that’s way above my pay grade, and pitch me against the other stakeholders I work closely with. He would randomly called me into the office to tell me stir up the courage to against my stakeholders that I am supposed to work with. 6 months later I can’t stand it anymore, and I found out my ex boss from our original company that’s acquired is moving on to a new company. I reached out to him about my dilemma and he’s kind enough to organized a meeting with my stakeholders and make them agree I will transfer out of my current department to department C.\n\nMy ex boss left, and I was sad because I felt no one in this new company will now have my back. I tried to mind my own business and do good work for stakeholders. And I actually received a lot of positive feedback from them and the external client. I know they are working on my transfer to department C but I didn’t even press on the issue once, again just mind my business.\n\nAfter 3 months, the head of department C reached out to me to try to match my title/job description for the new role. And the same time my annual review is due this month. She sent me a role for junior title position- I mentioned the conversation of title review when I was first hired and ask if the review is still happening with transition - I didn’t aggressively demand anything but just ask for clarification. The head of dept C said she would need to talk to Boss A and Boss B, and of course they both denied a conversation ever happened.\n\nWhat really shocked me was none of my stakeholders have backed me up despite the constant positive feedbacks I have been getting . In an accideny leaked email chain, one of them even called me “ irritating” “ manipulating” and “ I need to stop pitching people against each other”.. I don’t understand how’s asking clarification about my job title and duty was to pitching people against each other?? Now I can see why 80% of employees from my original company left a year after acquistion, including my ex boss who convinced me to stay.\n\nThey are having another meeting this Friday to talk about me without my presence and a meeting with me next week. I honestly not sure how to react  knowing what was said about me behind my back.. \n\nPart of me want to quit for good because numerous red flag with this position and the company and the jerk who ruined my promotion chance in the new dept with his “ comments”\n\nMy only drawback is I am planning to have a baby at the end of this year and with the current economy situation, it’s risky to start a new job.. However I don’t know how I can pretend nothing happened and just pretend I don’t know.",

One morning when we were walking down the stairs, a man, probably early to mid 20s, walked his dog near our stairwell. Both our dogs started barking, and he goes, \"she's really friendly, if you want them to meet?\". I said no, and we each went on our way.\n\nA few other times I also saw him with his dog around this time in the morning. Once we were still aways from each other and he said, \"you can go ahead, if you want them to meet?\". I  him, \"no, you go ahead\", which he did. Another time when I was walking back to my building, he started walking on the sidewalk, so I walked with my dog along the backside of the parked cars, thankfully he didn't say anything. During all these run ins, it was still dark outside.\n\nThen I started taking my dog out earlier, around 6a. She's 13, and has been waking up earlier, so I hadn't seen him. Except for one Saturday afternoon, when I was going for a walk by myself. I saw him from a distance outside the complex. He unleashed his dog, then watched her take a dump, and didn't clean it up! Then had her cross the road unleashed! So that's the kind of person he is...\n\nAnyway, this morning I took my dog out around 6:30a. We're currently in the middle of an ice storm. So it was raining freezing rain and so cold. As I'm walking back to my building I hear, \"hey!\" Again, it's dark out, and raining and cold, so I'm terrified because I'm in my pajamas and don't have my contacts in so I can't see anything. I say loudly, \"oh my God!!\" Then he says, \"can our dogs meet?\" So I say, \"NOOOO!!\" And clutch my pepper spray on the walk back.\n\nWtf!!! He can't take a hint, so I wonder if next time I should be like, \"stop talking to me! I'm not interested!!\" But he knows where I live obviously. Ugh.",

The length doesn't matter as much as does the fact that this has felt like the healthiest relatiosnhip I have had so far in my life. Recently we have had some arguments which have deeply saddened me though. I come from an Asian country, moved to the US about a decade ago for grad school. BF is US born white man. Culturally we are very different, even though our values and lifestyle choices match up well.   \nWhenevr I talk to him about any issues I have had with my family not being as open-minded as I would like, his response is \"why do you care baout what they think? You give them too much power.\" Whereas my stance is I have to balance how far my paretns have come considering the way they were raised, to accepting me and my choices (to be unmarried in my 30s, to not have kids, etc). He doesn't seem to understand nuance that is required in this situation. Recently I had an argument with BF over my immigration status. I ahve a PhD, and was recently told I cannot get a green card any time soon bec of my qualifications not being enough, and because I am from India, there is a backlog of about 13 years at this point. BF basically told me this is not a discriminatory policy, that I am in this situation because \"there are a lot of Indians immigrating here\", and it's not unfair to have these long wait times and to have thousands of people be stuck in this limbo for a decade or more. I have been feeling increasingly like I have no future in the US, which is deeply saddening on its own. It felt even more of a gut punch to have someone who claims to love me, and who claims to be a socialist, agree with the policy and not consider how damaging it is to my life and my career.   \nMy therapist says to have a conversation with him and let him know that I want comfort and validation, not a theoretical argument about a concept or policy. I worry I am going to be too resentful and sad over this thing happening, and will keep questioning what his real beliefs are. Has anyone dealt with anything along these lines? Have you come out of these types of situations with your relationship intact?",

        "text": "We've (35F, 35M) hit a snag, and it's probably the biggest yet in our almost 18 years together.\n\nI'll give some context shortly, but ultimately it's about differing communication styles, how we individually handle stress, and I guess a lack of vulnerability between us. Looking for advice on how we move forward, and if we need a professional (I think we do), what are we looking for?\n\nHe handles stress by becoming more introverted and withdrawn. I have to press hard for details on his life and notice he stops showing interest in mine, and I'll admit on my side it's quite routine but that's just where we are. I'm not dismissing depression, but he would say that he isn't.\n\nI handle stress by obsessing over lists and try to feel like I'm in control. My perfectionist side comes out in full force and I get more stressed and overwhelmed as a result.\n\nHe avoids conflict with me. He feels that if he calls me out, he'll get snapped at, so he might as well be quiet until I snap at him anyway. He's not wrong.\n\nI feel like I'm always nagging or criticising so I try to keep my mouth shut but it festers until I hit breaking point and snap at him. I'm a blunt person by nature and work really hard to keep that in check (20 years on and I'm still 'ok' at it), but I think I go too far in censoring myself with him.\n\nWhy it's all come to a head:\nI thought we were on the same page about having a baby, to the point where my birth control came out last month. I'd asked him several times over a period of months if he wanted a child, and we'd agreed to start trying in January (that happened mid last year). We haven't had sex and he hasn't mentioned it at all, so I knew something was up. He finally shared his worries yesterday; finances and time (the usual suspects) but also my mental health as I have a history of anxiety and depression. He says he still wants a baby but I know this means he isn't ready - *we* aren't ready, no matter how I feel as an individual.\n\nThere's a whole other thing about how I wish he'd told me sooner before I went through IUD removal etc, but more importantly, why he felt he couldn't/wouldn't tell me. I don't feel we can navigate this as we are now, because I feel like I will just make things worse.",

I know it’s not exactly right to think so. But I don’t have an idea on how to bridge this disparity.

Don't do that!\" \n\nIt turned out that she did care (of course she did), and her reasoning was that she liked hairy men because she was smooth herself. This makes sense to me, it's basically the heterosexual impulse - you're attracted to someone who is different from yourself.\n\nThat's a pretty small sample size though, and it goes against media depictions of what men should aspire too. So I thought I'd ask you all: Do you like your men smooth, like a movie star? Completely unkempt, like a Hungarian sheepdog? Or something in between?\n\nWhat about specific patches of body hair, like that bit on the lower back? Or shoulder hair? Even Homer Simpson shaves his shoulders...\n\nI will accept \"I don't care.\" answers from homosexual women only.",

When my friends treat badly I just distance myself and cut them off and the idea of actually talking to them about it makes me want to hurl. \n\nThe instances where I distanced myself were - a friend who would keep dismissing me and very indirectly speaking about my weight and also constantly condemning my choices of not being very social (I’m an introvert).I never told her that she hurt me but I just distanced myself and drew a boundary on how I would speak with her(I would be neutral to her taunts). So am I wrong here for not discussing with her first? I genuinely don’t feel like. \n- a friend who distanced me after I didn’t meet her for a while due to being depressed + just with work. It rubbed me the wrong way that she expected me to meet her anyway and then proceeded to push me away when I couldn’t. (For ex- when I finally got out of my shell and asked to meet she very rudely told me she couldn’t anymore. Spoiler- she could. She just didn’t want to with me anymore). In this situation I thought of apologising for not being able to meet her for a while, but  I didn’t  feel like apologising to her because -a while ago, she had come to my birthday dinner a whole TWO hours late because she had met another friend first (knowing we were supposed to meet) and couldn’t leave cause he kept insisting that she stay(like?? Do you have no agency there?)and even after she finally came, she did not apologise and I let it go cause shit happens. Why is that courtesy not being extended to me? \n\n\nSo what I’m asking is. Why do we push away friends rather than tell them when they hurt us so that they could do better but we extend that courtesy to our partners? And is it wrong that I prefer being this way? Is there anything I need to change about myself?",

He’s content with his routine and gets annoyed when I send him job postings that have more consistent work. We’ve talked about it many times and he swears that he will change but I’m starting to feel like it’s just words at this point. But I don’t know if my expectations are unfair. It feels that way when he makes enough to take care of just his portion of bills and relax 7 months but I’m working full time. I should note we’ve been together for 6 years, married for 1.",

I'm there to language exchange. \n\nEither way, in both these types of platforms I get the usual requests from men who want to immediately meet or (and in Bumble) men who try to make me feel bad or completely stop talking to me if I'm not re-scheduling things to be able to fit them.\n\nFor example; talking to a guy for a while, very polite but not really seeming that interesting from the messages. I kept talking  cause maybe he's just awkward online. We start talking  about coffee so he brings up eventually meeting for a cup. I went ahead and told him, hey I'm going to your prefecture this weekend for this thing, wanna meet up then? I'm  on a budget, so I'm  not gonna be traveling out of my prefecture for a while, I told him. We agree and last minute he tells me he got called in to work because someone didn't show up. That's fine, I was gonna go there anyway and tells me he'll travel to my prefecture for next time. He tries to reschedule and I have to remind him I'm not going on a train and that my days off are only weekends. Have not heard from him since. \n\nNow on the language app I was, I thought, helping a guy with his Spanish but all of a sudden he starts going on how he wants to meet and talk in person, like after maybe 3 days at most, and I get it to an extent. I prefer to do language exchange face to face as well, but I wouldn't meet someone I just started talking to online like that. He asks me to go to a japanese bar. So I tell him, I really don't like when people waste my time, I'm  more than happy to help people with English or Spanish but if you're here for something different you need to stop. Nothing else from him.\n\nI feel on one hand I'm proud of myself,  because before I'd just agree to go after having just starting to talk to someone, or change my schedule or actually pay and go to another  prefecture again, spending money I shouldn't; but I started feeling like.. Is being like this like shooting myself in the foot? Am I cutting out my options and missing out on finding someone because of these sort of responses I'm giving 🥲😞? \n\nI really wish I could be someone who is not afraid of being alone for the rest of their lives. I really do, but I'm not. I'm ok right now, where I am happy. I'm working on my goals (saving up for a new apt. So that I can bring my cats to Japan with me, along with my best friend and mom). I love my job, where I live. I don't get on the dating apps as much as I used to, rarely now. I do what I would do whether I'm myself or not. But of course there's that fear and I've become better at stopping those intrusive thoughts that tell me I'm not gonna find anyone but when this sort of thing happens I think I'm doing this to myself 😞\n\nSend help and cheesewhiz 🥲",

The reason we're heading there is that I just learned that my dad is losing his vision and want him (my dad) to move-in with me. He was panicking because that's too much for him, and I get why, but I can't just let my dad get all sad and crippled on his own. Part of me really wants to end it, because 2 years ago when my mom got sick, my then-husband completely disappointed me with his lack of support and I can't go through this again with another man not being there for me when I need him. \n\nI feel like I'm just going to give up on dating while I still have a living parent and pick it back up some time in my 40s. Completely impossible to get anyone to accept that I have aging parents to take care of, and that they are on the other side of the world, and I'm the only living relative who can do it. \n\nNow I think that makes me a good person and want to be with someone who will give me credit for it, and share the burden of this problem with me, but I'm not sure it will happen. Feels so lonely :(",

He is now my boyfriend, although we are long distance for now.\n\nI will let him go if things don't feel right. In fact I tried several times already, but then I call him and convince him to forgive me and try again. I feel horrified when as I write this. Things got better and now I am stronger. But I am horrified and looked at the reason for my behaviour. The reason Is fear. I fear I'll never find someone.",

        "text": "So I’m 27. I work part time for a professor and part time as a nanny. I’m still in school. I really try to prioritize down time and I focus a lot on self-care. I’m done with everything by 8-9pm basically. I couldn’t work later even if I wanted to (which I dont) and I’m not exactly the girlboss hustler type for reference.\n\nMy bf of 6 years is an engineer. He works in commercial HVAC design and sales. We’ve lived together for 3 years and he’s been working at the same company the whole time. The first year he worked normal-ish hours. Like M-F 8-6. But in the past year it’s gotten crazy: he wakes up around 5 to go on site at least 3 days a week. Stays at the office everyday til 7pm. Sometimes later. Comes home and is on the phone, sending emails and going over over plans until 11pm. He works through the weekends. \n\nHe loves his work and he’s super ambitious. Which I LOVE about him. He’s really trying to get a raise and prove himself at the company. But I don’t think any milestone reached will ever be enough for this to let up. But we talk about getting married and having kids and I worry. Im willing to, but scared to, have to parent mostly alone. Or have him miss important times. I also just miss him now. But I don’t want to be selfish or him back at the same time. \n\nAny advice?",

        "text": "I earn about $120k a year. My husband earns $75k from his day job and $70/hr from a contract job he only does about an average of 5 hours a month/60 hours a year, so that’s another $4k bringing his contribution up to $79k. \n\nI wouldn’t care about the income inequity except that, to take this much higher paying job, I had to agree to go back into an office that was an hour’s commute away with the exception of one work from home day a week. I work a solid 40, sometimes up to 42-44 hours per week if an emergency comes up over the weekend. My husband has admitted himself that he has only 1-2 hours of work/meetings per day. Frequently he has zero work/meetings in a day. Ask him and he can’t think of a single day where he’s had to work more than 3 hours max in the past year. It’s the nature of his work - he has a very specialized skill and because of specific certifications in his field, it’s easier for the company to retain him than outsource it. There are other jobs where he could work more/earn more but he’s very happy with the “work/life” balance. Meanwhile, with this set up, I have very little time to do most household tasks without sacrificing my few hours of leisure after my son goes to bed or family time, and he has about 25-30 “free” hours a week, not counting weekends. \n\nHe currently does do a lot of household tasks but I’d requested he do more of some very specific tasks and he’s expressed that he feels like I’m asking too much, so coming here to see some examples of fair divisions for people in similar circumstances.\n\nWhat is reasonable to expect if he’s alone at home all week for 40 hours and only works about 10-15 of those hours? My overall take on it is that, on average, keeping our household running and clean should only require 10 or so hours of housework/shopping a week max (2 hours per workday) and if he did literally everything, he’d still have significantly more leisure time than I do while enjoying the “perks” of being in a high income household despite only earning $80k. Would love to hear this group’s thoughts on whether that’s a fair ask.",

We got along quite well but a few things he said bothered me:\n\na) We were talking about soccer players and their wives and girlfriends (WAGS) and he mentioned how these women only cared about money, shoes, etc, and \"there was nothing to talk about with these women.\" He then proceeded to say that they purposely went for soccer players and the whole arrangement was like 'prostitution.' I challenged him pretty hard on this - these soccer players obviously want a VERY beautiful woman so why lay the blame at the women's feet? Seems like a fair arrangement to me! And these soccer players probably aren't great conversationalists either lol.\n\nb) He dressed ok for the date but could have made more effort with grooming and fashion sense. He wasn't dressed terribly but his sneakers could have used a wash. It made me think he didn't respect me or the date that much, especially as I dressed quite nice.\n\nc) Made another comment about someone being a gold-digger. I mean, if he can't see how women are still disadvantaged financially in the world and have to resort to marrying to get ahead, then I don't know where he has been living in the past twenty years.",
