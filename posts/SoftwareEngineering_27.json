        "text": "Evening you all. Over the last year of college (which also happens to be my last year), I've begun to realize that I'm running through constant rejection within looking for work in the tech industry. I enjoy Software Development, but I'm not afraid to admit that I don't think I'm going to enjoy or be my most productive in the tech-boom sector of work going on in the States. I have experience working in a startup, working on projects, and working with other developers. I enjoy software development, but I'm beginning to realize that I find the tension behind tech-industry pushers to be far more than I'd like to be involved in. I'd rather a pay-cut and healthy work-life balance and time to do my hobbies over the generous benefits that the big-players and even the new supercharged small businesses have. I wanna recover from school a little and then figure out work ambitions, but I need a job and come from a family of low education and wealth, so I'm not picky about where I can work, and how much I get paid (just trying to do better than my parents, so I can provide for some people who I might have to end up providing for over the next year). I'm very open to the idea of working in the technology departments of non-tech businesses. I think I could provide some value to an employer there, and I don't have any complaints about perceived prestige. Any recommendations are greatly appreciated, and I'm happy to provide more information about myself if needed.",

We are asking all of you for any pain points in your development process, environment, or just daily grind, that you might gain better insight into or improve through better measurements or metrics.\n\nFor example, do you have trouble with builds breaking and would like to see analytics on what percentage of commits cause compile issues?  Or is it difficult to determine how much, if at all, static code analysis finds issues that would not otherwise have been discovered?\n\n*Feel free to post any relevant thought or pain point you experience along with how you currently deal with that difficulty.  If you see a reply that you agree with, do upvote that response and reply with any other additional information you feel that adds to the original reply.*\n\nThank you for your input and time!
