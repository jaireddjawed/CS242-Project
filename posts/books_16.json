But in short, many of the wildly popular and critically lauded books that have been released within the past couple of years have been really disappointing to me, some of which I've found myself DNF'ing in a (probably unjustified) fit of rage. *Where the Crawdads Sing*, *The Midnight Library,* *Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow*, and most of ‎Taylor Jenkins Reid are all recent examples. Am I just bad at this game? Or have I just become a curmudgeon? It just seems like, in my attempts to stay current in literature, I keep landing duds.  \nI realize that what's considered to be a \"gem\" is still going to be a matter of opinion, but I imagine there are people out there who have developed better metrics than just \"what's on the NYT bestseller list or is viral on social media.\"",

But since leaving school and entering the day-to-day rhythm of real life, the time I have spent reading has drastically reduced. I think this is in big part because I now spend all my time in a bust office or in my tiny apartment. At work there are always conversations or interruptions that break my focus. At home, at times where I'd like to read, my partner may be on her phone or watching TV. Obviously, this is not a *problem* but I have a very hard time reading when there are those kinds of auditory distractions. In college I could ignore them without issue, so I don't know what's changed. Does anyone have a method for zoning out those kinds of distractions or a tip to help me stay focused?

I might watch one short show in the morning or at night (usually a classic sitcom I've seen already), but I find I don't binge shows like I used to. I get bored.\n\nHowever, I've been reading more and more. Novels, webtoons, and manga are all taking up more of my time these days.\n\nI've been pondering the reason for this, but I can't really explain it. It's kind of more chill, I guess? I can go at my own pace, take time to think about the words and stop to appreciate the artwork.\n\nIDK, it seems like, objectively speaking, video is *better* than literature. It has sound and movement. Despite that, I don't find myself getting pulled in like I used to. But I'm getting immersed in books, especially comic books, more than before.\n\nActually, come to think of it, I still enjoy movies. I've been on kind of a early 90s anime film kick. I'll watch one every week or so. They're relaxing and introspective and have that youtube lofi vibe. And I still love going to the theater if there's a movie I'm really interested in or if I have a date. \n\nBut, even if I really like a series, I can't seem to keep going. I'll watch a couple episodes, then forget about it. \n\nMeanwhile, I've been binge reading a novel, a manga, and a webtoon. I find them all easy to keep going. \n\nI guess this was kind of rambling. Anyways, anyone have any thoughts on this topic?",

Letting her figure that out on her own as she grows up.\n\nThe message I'm trying to give the world is how each and every one of you reading this has the potential to be the hero everyone in your life needs.

A world just like our own but with a little twist about what the darkness hid. Ahh percy jackson and the lightning thief how could I ever forgot the first demigod I’ve met . I know about the greek gods and demigods because of you. I’ve learned the feats of zeus and the prowess of hercules because of you. I was transported to a place where a random god can just fuck a random person and bear offsprings that are much greater than man but less for a god. From that day on I followed your story, I have went to olympus where the gods party and live . I’ve went to camp half-blood where demigods interact and compete. I’ve even went to the underworld where the most misunderstood god reside.\n\nHow can I forget my first ever world. Then I’ve read something much closer to our reality . I’ve read the dead poet’s society. It gave me hope about literature and expressing myself through regulated stanzas and paragraphs to create the most extraordinary piece of human literature, a piece that when created beautifully, can become so many things, it can become a song , a speech or just the most amazing methapor.\n\nThen I was carried off to the masterful creation of Paulo Coelho, where as a dumb teenager I was able to appreciate how you described sex. At first it was the only reason I have picked up a book of yours, but the thing is when I was in that world that you created I wasn’t able to blemish that fiery representation of love. I was hooked about what freedom and true love looks like. That might have been the reason that I become a hopeless romantic. But I am glad for who I am, a person who is able to appreciate solitude and search for a true stability in both body and mind.",

I started off by reading *The Murders in the Rue Morgue* \\- and my god, you can see entirely where Conan Doyle lifted the concept from some 40 years later.\n\nI'm enjoying the story, but it got me thinking. Why do Victorian and other nineteenth century writers write in this over the top style, where everything is described in excruciating detail? Every tangent is explored fully. It's painful as a modern reader. I find myself switching off, having to make conscious efforts to keep on the page or skip ahead to where the narrative begins again.\n\nThis is something I've seen in most nineteenth century authors I've read: Dickens, Conan Doyle, Hardy, both the Brontë sisters, Thackeray... But it seems to disappear from western literature by the '20s. What happened?\n\nWas it the consequence of modernism? Changing audience tastes? Writers no longer paid by the word?",

Not only do I feel I can appreciate it better as I got older and more mature, but in particular (I remembered my opinion on it because I used to annotate my books with little comments lol) I noticed how differently I felt about the cheating scandal with Anna and Vronsky. \n\nWhen I was younger I thought Anna was in the right, and that she should pursue her true love and that her husband should just get over it and leave her be instead of trying to stay with her to protect his reputation. I was just so shocked at how much my opinion changed! I was all the way siding with Anna at one point, and now I found myself seeing the realistic applications of their continued union as well as feeling for Alexey K. in his predicament. Does any one else have any strong feelings on that point of contention in the book?",

In Chapter 7, it's about a character named (in the first line) as Styopa Likhodeev.  Ok, that's his name, right?    Well, about 2 pages later Woland says to him 'Good morning, my most sympathetic Stepan Bogdanovich!'.    What?!?  Who?  Turns out they are the same person.\n\nSo what is the naming convention here?  Is there a First Middle Last and then a nickname or an affectionate name?   And which is formal and which is informal?    Is there a guide of name -&gt; nickname.  (I know someone name is Alexei but goes by Alyosha, which is a little odd to because it's actually longer and has more syllables.  In English we go from William to Bill, Thomas  to Tom, etc.)  \n\nThe same thing happens in a couple of different places and it makes it hard to keep track of the large number of characters.",

Also at some point he organizes some kind of video game where players become some kind of monsters, but the game actually make players go crazy irl and commit school shootings and stuff like that; and at the end the main characters fight against him in some type of old nba player's house, and I can't remember what happens after that. Last time I read it it was in french and the name was something similar to antichrist. I couldn't find the appropriate subreddit for this type of request but I mean i've been dying to read this book again and just can't remember the name for the life of me. \n\nIf anybody remembers the name I'd read it immediatly, thanks so much in advance",

But when high school kicked in I found myself struggle to keep the habit, I had less time and less will. But i do not want to get around it, main problem was smartphone and social media. It's not that i have not read anything at all in those years, but rarely and occasionally. Maybe 1-2 book a year on average.\n\nI am now in a time of my life where i really want to improve myself, and give up many bad habits. And I want to start reading again, enjoy a great book under my blanket and rediscover that joy i felt as a kid.\n\nSo, long story short, you guys have some suggestion for first book of the journey? \n\nFor giving you a bit of context a few years ago I enjoyed very much \"The Swarm\" (Frank Schatzing) and in my childhood I loved Verne. I read also King, Cooper and Manfredi. I guess it's fair to say I enjoy reading about adventure. My preferred themes are oceans and space.\n\nI know it's not much I can give to you, but in reality i don't know myself what i really like. Feel free to suggest anything, but be aware it's my first book in a year, so not something too complicated (no problem with lenght).\n\nThanks a lot!",

I am aware that House of Leaves as complicated as it is amazing, so being confused is apart of the thrill. So it makes perfect sense that I am entirely confused about who’s writing I am reading. I just finished Johnny Truant’s introduction, and have begun reading the first chapter about The Navidson Record. The thing that confuses me is who authored these articles about TNR? I know Johnny and Zampanó wrote the footnotes (as well as “The Editors” every now and then?) but I’m just at a lost on who’s writings I am reading when I am not reading footnotes.",

Don't expect any detailed scientific explanations though, this book is catered for casual science fans. \n\nAlso it shows outsiders that the scientific community is in fact a very pashionate one and those people love their field. The book contains a dispute between the author and a Spanish astronomer team about ethics in science (which was blown up by the media). \n\nSo if you are interested in science history (not sure if you can call it history yet) and are a fan of astronomy or space in general, I can highly recommend this book. As mentioned above, it won't give you detailed information about anything, so if you are looking for this, this book is not for you.\n\nWhat do you guys think about the book? This is my first (non-fiction) book that goes in the direction of space in general, so I'd be eager to hear the opinion of people who have a better understanding of the matter than me.",

I would go to the library, check out a foot-tall stack of books, read them all, and be back the following week for more.

I wanted to read this so badly, which is why I finally, finally got my hands on a copy and started reading right away. I also finished reading it right away.\n\nMy thoughts:\nWell, first of all, I love the way I can identify with Ari and Dante, but especially with Ari. Sometimes his stubbornness got on my nerves and I wanted to shake him and tell him that he should just go and love Dante. But on the other hand, everything just felt so real.\nWhich leads me to my second point about how I kept on reading and nodding my head, smiling about how true some statements and feelings pictured in the novel felt. The thing is, Sáenz does not try to be philosophical and poetic. He doesn't have to.\nThird, you can see how Ari grows. In the beginning, he is a 15-year-old boy, he talks like a 15-year-old boy, he thinks like one. But as he grows older he learns and experiences things, especially through Dante, he changes. I just want to state that this novel is a perfect example of character development.\n\nWhat bothered me (just a little), is the ending. Yes, it's happy and lovely and that's what I wished for but I had the feeling that everything went too fast. Particularly the revelations about the past.\nAnd also I am kind of angry. Why, whywhywhy couldn't we read more about their happy ever after? I mean, I've been waiting for this the whole time and now I don't even get two whole pages of Ari&amp;Dante as a couple! Thats it.",

Both were recommendations from my wife, who had read both and got a lot out of them. Both were gifts from a friend of hers who is a psychiatrist and who I respect a lot. Bottom line:  I have every reason to believe that these people genuinely thought I would enjoy reading these books. \n\nI hadn't got very into either of them before I realized that I was gripped with anxiety. Without saying too much, these books are both about disadvantaged youth and (I'm guessing here) the way they have to face the world as totally disadvantaged people and (I'm guessing here) the way in which the world totally eats people like them up on an hourly basis, before spitting out what's left of them and pissing on their remains. \n\nI dread what is going to happen to the children in these books. I dread what is going to happen to them as the pages go by. I care about these characters and their lives and only I'm like thirty pages into each book. Surely this is a sign of a good author, but I cannot say that I am enjoying either of these experiences. I can't say that I want to read another page because I don't want to see what happens next, because I don't think it's going to be very good for them. \n\nI'm not enjoying these experiences. I don't understand it at all. I have read plenty of books where bad things happen to good characters. I've read every word of Infinite Jest three times and there is PLENTY of bad shit happening there. I have no idea what is going on with me right now but this seems like something I'm going to worry about for a while.",
