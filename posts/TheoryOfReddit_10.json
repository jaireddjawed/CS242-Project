The upvotes for these drawings are far and few in between as a matter of luck.\n\nI believe the reason of the mass downvote was the common perception that these accounts were created solely with karmawhoring purpose - to garner more karma. Therefore they were generally frowned upon.\n\nPersonally, I think it is not fair to assume these accounts are created just for karma earning purpose.\n\nI would like to have your thoughts on these novelty drawing accounts. Do You look down on them simply because of their \"karmawhoring\" nature or do You think they at least have some positive redeeming value to Reddit conversations just as another means (text, links, gifs, memes etc.) to enliven the topics or to contribute to the expansion of the dialogue in visual forms.\n\n",

        "text": "Suppose that:\n\n1. The /r/redesign is coming\n\n2. Reddit (the company) wants to bring reddit (the service) closer other social media services like Twitter or Facebook, especially in terms of a focus on users vs. topics, with the redesign and other design decisions (the ability to follow users, Reddit Chat, [the ongoing Circle of Trust](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/891b9a/rcircleoftrust_is_reddits_2018_april_fools/dwpafop/) etc.)\n\n3. Many users (myself included) weren't (/r/proCSS) or aren't (/r/redesign again) happy with this\n\n4. [Digg](https://www.sitepoint.com/3-painful-site-redesign-disasters/) [happened](https://searchengineland.com/digg-v4-how-to-successfully-kill-a-community-50450)\n\nAnd then let's play through things if they hypothetically happen yet again. What if the redesign drives a significant number of reddit users away from reddit towards a new favourite time-wasting location? Where would they go? What alternatives are there?\n\nThe answer is... none, really. Facebook and Twitter are obviously right out. The classical destination for reddit exiles would be Voat, but if we trust in humanity enough to further suppose that the amount of Nazis and racists is overall neglible, then that's also a no-go zone. And then what's left? \n\nThe only real other possibility I could find was [Diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora_(software)), which aims to be an open-source, decentralized, anonymous content aggregator. It seems right up the alley of what reddit once prided itself on being - a harbour for tech-savvy, content-oriented, privacy-fanatical IT people - but Diaspora [may be too much even for those](https://phyks.me/2015/01/why-i-am-quitting-diaspora.html). The communities of reddit have proven that they can handle doing CSS and forum moderation, but physically setting up whole servers and writing the code to run on them in Ruby on Rails just to follow hashtags seems a bit too much of a hassle. While the prospect of isolated, feudal communities, organized around a priest caste of Ruby coders running the holy Diaspora servers in their basements seems too interesting to pass up on, I just don't see it happening, not in today's easy world of professionally designed cat picture delivery services. Escaping online gentrification has its boundaries.\n\nSo what? Seems like we're pretty much left with reddit, right? Nowhere to go, even if an ever-increasing focus on users and ever-narrowing customization makes the site ever more boring and less innovative? Well... What if I told you the exodus has probably already started happening, quietly and on a subreddit-by-subreddit basis? Check the sidebars or the stickied posts in /r/badliterature, in /r/LetsTalkMusic; in /r/blender, in /r/python or, of course, in /r/discordapp; remember the massive drive towards Discord servers that took place a year ago with /r/place and that the reddit admins probably panicked about quite a bit (see: Reddit Chat). \n\nWhat I'm seeing is an emigration of whole communities into the server (community)-based chat sphere. While the way usually still leads through the subreddit itself, actual conversation and content aggregation has wandered off into the private spheres of chats. Anecdotally, this definitely holds up; I know of one case where an offspring subreddit of another subreddit was pretty much killed by the community transferring onto Discord and just getting a channel for their niche project there, and another where a regular community interaction thread was put into stasis after the discovery that Discord just did the job better. I also know I definitely use Discord over Reddit if I want to communicate with a community that has a Discord server. This would also be an interesting phenomenon to look at from a statistical point of view.\n\nNow, there's a problem that's rather obvious: While /r/LetsTalkMusic has 55k users, their Discord has... 50? the scales are off by a thousand. And yet, I still think the influence is valid. The [1% rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)) is by now well known; and if that one percent of active content contributors decides it'd rather have instant feedback than a federation of forums whose search function has been broken for the last five years, I can see this trend going on a whole new scale if the redesign adds an additional measure of antagonization.\n\nNow, Discord isn't an obvious Reddit clone. For one, it's a chat service, not a website. Discussions take an eternity, and memes take over any conversation in an instant. But there are upsides as well: Channels allow communities magnitudes of categorization and hierarchization that just aren't possible on reddit, bots and emojis allow customization, and the damn search function works. And also, all of this does also require that this whole phenomenon is not just a total product of my imagination.",

I just posted a correction and said that I think the post was wrong. I didn't attack anyone. I was not being negative. Just a short comment on the point itself. Banned. Now, I could not know that would get me banned but on the other hand one guy did tell me: \"This is a campaign sub. This sub is not about being factually correct\". So basically I broke an unwritten rule. Anyway, I'm not complaining about this. I'm just using it as an example.\n\n/r/Conservative also banned me. I was discussing aborting with a conservative user there from a centrist position. I was banned and told that the sub was for conservatives only.\n\nr/Russia banned me for criticizing Putin. Yeah, they ban Russians for criticizing the government. It's hard to believe this is true. But the mods there are huge Putin fanboys. They love everything about him and support him in his elections. They also talk about attacking, fighting and hitting people who don't vote for Putin. Again, no way one could know this. I visited the sub for Russian culture information but politics kinda took it over and I commented on a political thread there.\n\nI'm banned from several left leaning subs because I posted on /r/imgoingtoshellforthis . I actually agree that the sub is in poor taste. But I don't use it for serious matters. Still, I don't think it should have gotten me banned from many subs. Now when I see a sub with the words: women, woman, feminist, left, socialist or something like that. I just assume I may have been banned from it without ever having commented there. I have tried to ask mods about bans like that but they usually just mute me and that's it.\n\n/r/WikiLeaks \n\nI was banned from Wikileaks for criticizing Assange for the way he used his Twitter account. I though it was completely unprofessional to use it to spread rumors. Also, I support Wikileaks and think they are essential for a free society. So I don't hate Assange or Wikileaks.\n\nI have never been banned from a sub because I broke any of their sidebar rules as far as I know. r/Russia has not a single rule on the sidebar that states that you can't criticize Putin. I was not even doing it in a mean way. I just said that I was against him seeking reelection last time. I didn't bring up rumors or attack his politics or his person.\n\nNow when I visit a new sub I feel like the sidebar rules are complete misleading and too basic. They often just say stuff about personal attacks and spam. Which I have never done anyway. So I'm trying to discover the unwritten rules instead. What do the other people do? What do they like? Who do they support? How do they talk? Which biased and worldviews do they have? Then I try to not attack these things directly because otherwise I do feel like mods will ban me directly for these transgressions. For example, this subreddit has long sidebar. There are a ton of stuff there. But I don't feel that bad for breaking these rules by mistake as I just think my post would be deleted. But I also know that TheoryOfReddit leans left. So I'm very nervous about criticizing anyone or anything from the left on this sub. This is also why I focused on the right leaning subs in my argument.\n\nDoes anyone feel a bit the same way? That the unwritten political biases rule the day? Obviously the mods cannot write in the sidebar \"We love Putin. If you don't support him we will ban you.\" But I wish they did.",

        "text": "This is a throwaway account because I don't want to get banned from reddit on my main if the admins ever find this gold and take action. (Hint: I've posted recently, and was my first post on r/TheoryOfReddit)\n\n\nIf you're the one that wants to exploit Reddit for all it's worth and squeeze upvotes and validation out of the collective hivemind of the internet just for **your** amusement, this guide is for you.\n\nPART 1: REPOSTING\n\n**Picking subreddits, and finding OC**\n\nIMHO for best results find a subreddit with 300k to 500k subscribers that has at least 1 post that reaches r/all per day. /r/ShittyLifeProTips works finely for my purpose. Karma and upvotes may wildly vary depending on setup.\n\nNow, find an OC post (Don't repost reposts) that is perferably:\n\nA few pages down from /top/ (so people won't see it as a blatant repost immediately)\n\nMore than a few months or a year old (Avoid things like memes that reflect the current culture of the time, as things have changed since then.)\n\nHave at least 10,000 upvotes (for smaller subs this may be hard)\n\n**Reposting**\n\nDownload the image/text post from reddit onto your computer. Now when submitting, play around with the title a bit. Choose one that you think will give you the most clicks.\n\nOr keep the title the exact same if you're confident in the fact the general Reddit population won't see this as a repost (at least for a while)\n\nIf your post gains 60 upvotes in 1 hour (one upvote per minute) or more, you're practically golden. \n\nNow for a little disclaimer:\n\nIt will probably never work the first time. You may have to expiriment with certain subreddits, OC, and title to get the right combo.\n\nYour post will likely be removed by the sub's Mods, or even be banned from the sub altogether. This **is** a dangerous game believe it or not. You might find yourself banned from all of Reddit if you're unlucky.\n\n\nThe best time to post on Reddit is between 6 to 8 am EST on a Sunday. If you can't allocate this time, posting from 6am to 4pm on a saturday also yields positive results. Never post midnight on Wednesday.\n\nSource: http://maxcandocia.com/article/2017/Jul/29/what-time-to-post-to-reddit/\n\n\n---\nPART 2: KARMAWHORING\n\nKarmawhoring (in my definition) is reposting something from one subreddit to another related subreddit to gain karma. Karmawhoring is less obvious than blatant reposting,\n\nas you're posting to a different subreddit.\n\nFollow the steps in Part 1, \"Picking subreddits and finding OC\" and post to roughly the same subreddit with the same or related topic.\n\n---\n\nPART 3: KARMA FARMING\n\nKarma farming is the act of taking posts/pictures off of another website (e.g. Facebook) and posting it to a subreddit (e.g. /r/insanepeoplefacebook)\n\nKarma farming only counts if you have a consistent supply of new material for said subreddit.\n\nBe careful, as in some cases you might be banned for spamming said sub.\n\n---\n\nPART 4: WITTY COMMENTS, JOKES, SARCASM, ETC.\n\nThis is the way most people gain their fortunes from reddit in my experience. The best place to do this is r/AskReddit. A good way to rake in the sweet karma is to make lengthy, elaborate stories about how you\n\nkilled someone or some shit. Just don't go too far or you'll probably end up on the front page of r/iamverybadass. Not fun.\n\nAnother way is to make jokes or make fun of someone else's comment. Puns really help too. If you can't really joke that well, this step probably isn't for you...\n\n---\n\nEND:\n\nI'm sorry if I halfassed this post, i wrote it in an hour. Just remember if you really screw up something, don't blame me, or the mod that rightfully removed you from your personal subreddit. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^message ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^u/promiscuousoxip ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^for ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^complaints\n",

This is just a quick spring break project which analyzes r/the_donald and r/politics.\n\nBy no means is the scientific data, but I did try to make it as scientific as possible.\n\nCheck out my github for all my code for the project: https://github.com/KaminskyJ/SubredditPolitics\n\nMethodology: Initially, I was using every book in Google’s database to generate “normal” word frequencies and then comparing that to subreddit frequencies. Reddit writes way too differently to get good data. Also, I couldn’t figure out a good way to deal with fake words like “ur” and other internet slang. Scratch that. If you want that code, it’s in the old versions folder.\n\nI then used r/all to determine differences in frequency (“RedditFrequency.txt”. I took the percent difference of frequencies to determine the most overused words of r/politics and r/the_donald. I saved those in “RepubsData.txt” and “DemsData.txt”. The top 10 are shown in OverusedWords.png. This turned out to be pretty good looking data. The top words are stereotypically democratic/republican.\n\nI then took subreddits and parsed every word and put them through a calculator. If they were found in either the republican or democratic dictionaries, their percent difference score would be added to the Republican or democratic totals (these are not necessarily mutually exclusive). Then I divided by the total number of words and got my “similarity indexes”.\n\nSubreddits that were known to be Republican were calculated to be more like r/the_donald and subreddits that were known to be democratic were calculated to be more like r/politics.\n\nSo I’m pretty happy with the results! If you have any questions, just ask!",

The percentages are posts for the last 30 days for Hillary/Bernie, and posts for just the last 24 hrs for Trump because the subreddit search only goes back so far. Essentially: liberals talk about Trump more than 3 times as much as conservatives do, and conservatives talk about Hillary more than 3 times as much as liberals. They're about the same on Bernie. The Hillary discrepancy is probably even more than this, since almost half the /r/politics posts about her were anti-Hillary posts that got downvoted to zero.\n\nAnyway, I'm kind of center-left but I follow both subs to get a left-leaning look at things and a right-leaning look at things, but I've been struck over time by how they are mostly talking about completely different subjects. Every time there's some post on /r/politics about some crazy thing Trump tweeted or said or did, I'm interested to see how conservatives will defend that thing, but generally they just aren't talking about it. This is all numerically consistent with politics-as-mudslinging: /r/conservative isn't making a lot of posts saying \"Trump is actually a great guy, and the Russia stories aren't important\", and /r/politics isn't making a lot of posts saying \"Hillary was a great candidate, let's see what she's up to nowadays\". They each just find it easier to talk about the failings of their opponents.",

        "text": "I always liked r/bestof. It was not intellectual and probably every second upvoted post there was just plain wrong. But it was great as a tool to discover new subs and new topics. I have visited many different interesting sport subs from there and learnt more about new cultures and countries.\n\nBut at this point the sub is pretty much a mirror version of r/politics. Every second post is anti-Trump or anti-conservative. If these were great posts I would still subscribe to the sub. But mostly it's factually wrong posts or just random opinions about how Trump sucks or conservative people are actually evil.\n\nThere is nothing I can do to stop it. I do point out mistakes and people do agree with me when I find mistakes in the r/bestof posts. The users are very critical there at times. At other times they just upvote and move on or even regurgitate the fake posts. These posts just keep coming and coming. And it seems like the good non-political posts are few and far in between now. There is also no replacement sub for it.\n\nThis happens time and time against. r/pics , /r/MurderedByWords , r/politics , /r/PoliticalDiscussion, /r/PoliticalHumor  and so forth. They all just become political subs for the left. I do like politics but this is propaganda, not politics. It's just opinions. And I don't even live in USA. So I don't want to hear about some stupid Reddit user conspiracy theory about how Trump actually is colluding with Facebook to create white men only zones or whatever.\n\nWhat's the solution? Only subscribing to small subs? Make anti American politics rules like /r/dataisbeautiful did?",

        "text": "I saw a post on /r/bestof that made to r/all that talked about how reddit is changing to be more appealing to advertisers. One of the predictions was that nsfw subs would be a target. I have a sub, r/TopSexyPosts, that lists posts from \"sexy\" subs that make into the top 200 of r/all. I noticed the number of those posts is going down. \n\nSo I made [a chart](https://i.imgur.com/MhEfR4s.png) to clearly see it. It shows the number of posts from the included subs that reached the top 200 each week. The included subs follow this rule: \"The most popular sexy posts in reddit. This include subreddits that are NSFW and some that aren't. They just need to be about female beauty in any form. It doesn't include subs focused on men, trans women or men, anime or cartoons.\" Some nsfw subs like /r/ImGoingToHellForThis/ are not included and some sfw like /r/gentlemanboners are included. The non-nsfw line shows posts from subs that aren't always nsfw, including nsfw posts in those subs. The complete list of subs can be found [here](/r/TopSexyPosts/wiki/index). Every time a sub the script doesn't know appear in the top 200, it lists the sub and I choose to include or exclude it.\n\nSo from the chart we can conclude that \"porn\" is appearing less in r/all, excepting during winter vacation in the northern hemisphere. Even softer \"porn\" from subs that aren't auto-nsfw like /r/gentlemanboners, /r/Celebs, /r/cosplaygirls and /r/PrettyGirls.\n\nWhat's changing? reddit's audience or algorithm?\n\n\n\n\n\n ",

        "text": "This is based on anecdotal evidence of a post I made that is currently at the top of /r/funny.\n\nI posted a picture to /r/funny which is currently the top post there. It was in the middle of the page of both /r/all and /r/popular, however 20 mins after that when I went to check its progress, it no longer is sitting anywhere on /r/all or /r/popular (at least it's not on the first 3 pages).\n\nWhat would cause it to simply disappear without slowly dropping down the list?\n\nMy theory is that it didn't receive enough of a boost in karma from /r/all exclusive traffic to keep it there.\n\nAny thoughts on why a post would rise to near the top of /r/all and then just vanish 20 mins later?\n\nEDIT: my post was apparently removed from /r/all by a moderator or admim. Found out via /r/Longtail. Now I'm just confused honestly",

That kind of contrast and decline on Reddit is unparalleled. \n\nThere are couple of things that I want to know in regards to this case. What are the reasons behind this decline? What kind of moderating policy are the mods of r/InternetIsBeautiful enforcing and what exactly are they trying to accomplish? Lastly, why hasn't any alternative to IiB emerged by now? Do Redditors as a whole generally not care about such content anymore?",
