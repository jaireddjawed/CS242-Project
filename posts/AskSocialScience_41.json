        "text": "Is the analytical framework created by Ruth Benedict in the Chrysanthemum and the Sword, of Shame Culture vs Guilt Culture (vs Fear Culture) accepted in any way by sociology or anthropology? At first glance, it kind of seems like a racist caricature, essentially arguing Japanese people (and East Asians in general) are incapable of feeling guilt and have no sense of individual morality, and instead construct a sort of totalitarian hive mind to enforce morality through shaming. The fact that nobody seems to ever mention the third leg of her classification, the Fear Culture, which describes African and other primitive tribal societies as also lacking individual morality but requiring the immediate threat of physical violence to enforce behavior, is very telling IMO. It's not portraying them as equal but different, it's a clearly hierarchical system of moral ability with white Europeans on top, Asians in the middle and blacks on the bottom.\n\nSo is there any scientific basis to this theory at all? I get the feeling it's one of those things that is plausible but unproveable and also unfalsifiable. Having read a lot about the country of Japan this analysis seems to underpin an absolutely enormous amount of Western thought and discourse about the place right up to today in TYOOL 2017. Even people who don't use these kinds of \"culturalist\" expanations appear to be almost uniformly unwilling to directly challenge them. It seems also to have taken root in Japan itself as a kind of right-wing self-essentialism and exists in a symbiotic relationship with the Western discourse. \n\nIf this theory is indeed bunkum then it seems to me that means that the dominant Western narrative on the country both at the popular and the specialist level is thoroughly permeated by a profound racism and Orientalism, and feeds an influential fascistic narrative within Japan itself. That would be pretty shocking and gross, so I'm not actually sure whether I'd prefer it to be true or not?",

For instance, we read some Marxist literature, which argued that class broadly determines various viewpoints within society. And we read some feminist epistemologists on the sociology of science, that pointed out the effects of gender bias on the standing of scientific theories. (Of course, we've also worked with a lot of empirical studies, but that's besides the point). This theory-heavy material is something that I find extremely interesting, and when thinking about it, I feel motivated to consider dedicating myself to further courses, maybe even graduate school in the field. Yet if I go to the website of a sociology PhD program at a research institution, and I read through the list of dissertations, they all seem to be extremely quantitative, or at the very least, relying heavily on very specific sets of empirical data. \n\nSo my question is: does this accurately represent what sociology is, these days? Very empirical and very quantitative, with little room for more philosophical theorizing? Or, were I interested in more theoretical research, would I find a place somewhere within the field?\n\nThanks in advance!",

This goes for the entire Schengen Area, which is basically continental Europe.\nDoes the United States have anything like that? If it does or does not, how does it compare to other standards around the world? I'm also wondering if after those 90 days in Spain, one would become an illegal immigrant. Cheers all.",

I thought I could do it by category: humanities, social sciences, cognitive sciences, physical sciences, and formal sciences seemed appropriate enough.\n\nHowever, I quickly ran into problems. Specifically, anthropology and history seemed all over the place as an enormous collection of information (biographies vs. political histories, cultural vs. economic anthropologies), philosophy is intertwined with fields that are not philosophical (like language, mathematics, science, etc. vs. epistemology/metaphysics which stands alone as its own category) as commentary, and the social sciences all feel like they're approaching the same issue from different schools of thought masquerading as fields with different scopes.\n\nI have no qualms about the fields themselves, but it really starts to make me feel like interdisciplinary fields are rife with categorical errors and academic inbreeding. Why is Max Weber a sociologist and not a political scientist? Why is methodology such an important distinction between whether something is considered \"humanities\" or \"social science\", when the same objects are being studied?\n\nI don't really know if I should make a thread about this, since I don't know if /r/AskSocialScience is the right place to get the best perspective on this. And I'm quickly spiraling off into many tangents, so I'll keep it short and simple: how do we organize academic fields?

        "text": "Cognitive science, while not as cohesive a field as its subdisciplines like linguistics or psychology, certainly has many of the makings of A Coherent Thing: there are departments and courses, professional societies, conferences, journals, textbooks, etc., all dedicated to cognitive science. I would further argue that there is some central dogma to cognitive science, even if not everyone agrees on it or what it means more precisely: cognition is information processing, aka computation.\n\nIt occurred to me while reading [Duncan Watt's recent perspective piece in the new Nature Human Behavior](http://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0015) that 'social science' could be -- likely *is* in some respects -- analogous to cognitive science in this way: an interdisciplinary field united by concern with interaction among intelligent agents. Psychologists might be interested in how people reason about each other while demographers are interested in the structure and change of groups of people, but they are both interested in *social* systems and processes.\n\nHowever, as a cognitive scientist interested in *social* science -- for one thing, I'm interested in how communities create and change language -- it's unclear to me that 'social science' has reached the cohesiveness (such as it is) of 'cognitive science'. *Are* there departments, professional societies, conferences, journals, textbooks, etc., all dedicated to *social* science?? I could be wrong, but my vague sense is that social science has not cohered as much as cognitive science. What would a candidate 'central dogma' of social science even be?\n\n**TL;DR: How cohesive a thing is 'social science'?**",

        "text": "Forgive me if this is the wrong sub for this, but it seems to fall outside the area of economics as well as ethics.\n\nI'm seeking to understand the bases by which people accept one medium of exchange over another, depending on circumstance, in order to meet an obligation or fulfill a debt.\n\nSome very broad examples to illustrate the problem:\n\n- a criminal is sentenced to a term of confinement, measured in units of time, in order to \"pay their debt to society\" after committing a crime. After completing the prison term, that prisoner could be said to have exchanged a forfeiture in liberty in exchange for forgiveness of the crime (perhaps forgiveness is the wrong term, but what's clear is that after serving the sentence that ex prisoner no longer has an obligation to the victim or the state).\n\n- I am obligated to be nice to my wife. If I hurt her feelings, her requirement for forgiveness is that I treat her better now and henceforth, and when I do she forgives me for the past unpleasantness on my part, satisfying a debt of sorts to her. Nothing else could conceivably settle this debt (ie I can't just tell her she looks to have gained weight and then cut her a check to make her feel better and get myself out of the doghouse).\n\n- my IRS bill has come due, and maaaan is it huge. They want me to pay them $100k as that is my lawful tax burden. Up to a certain point in time, I can pay the bill with USD and my debt is satisfied. If I fail to pay that debt in a manner deemed too flagrant, I will be imprisoned for a period of time. What was once a monetary debt can now be satisfied by being confined for a period of time, after which my debt is deemed satisfied. (Assume the criminal failure to pay taxes is punished only by prison, rather than prison and a fine equal to the tax debt, I plainly don't know how such penalties are assessed in reality and it's not really material to what I'm seeking to understand anyway.)\n\n-My mortgage note is due, and the bank expects a check for it by the due date. I can't confine myself at home to satisfy the debt (like a prisoner), and I can't simply treat the mortgage lender nicer (like I can my wife) to satisfy the debt. They only take money.\n\nWhat goes into making these determinations of acceptable value in order to satisfy different types of obligations? Does anyone offer a theory, for example, that addresses why I can't pay my babysitter in chewing gum, when another babysitter might find that payment medium satisfactory?\n\nThe tax example given above is the most puzzling to me, as different actions are acceptable to satisfy the debt at different points of time in the course of being indebted to the IRS. What tipping points do we create that make one method of debt satisfaction acceptable right up until that method is no longer accepted? \n\nI'd appreciate if anyone can identify the name of this problem, what area of study this falls under, and perhaps reading recommendations as well. Thanks gang.",
