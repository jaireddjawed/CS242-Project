He checked his speed again, making sure his cruise control was still steady at the uncharacteristic 3mph over the speed limit that he was allowing for this drive home \u2013 he was in a rush, after all. He\u2019d been waiting all week for Friday to come around ever since Steve had showed him a picture from somewhere online during their lunch break on Tuesday.  \u201cHey Norman will you look at this?\u201d he\u2019d said, turning his phone so Norman could see.  \u201cSome guy put 80 layers of seasoning on his cast iron.  Neat.\u201d  The picture of the impossibly smooth, mirror-like surface of the pan had sat with Norman since then, working in the back of his mind and cropping up during the evenings.  Could *his* pan ever look like that?\n\nWhen he got home he rushed inside excitedly, shuffling with abandon across his shoveled walk in defiance of any icy spots that may have cropped up during the day.  He\u2019d anticipated his glee the evening before and set a fresh sprinkling of salt to guard his steps, so he did remember to wipe his shoes with extra care before stepping inside.  Norman the cat blinked sleepily at Norman as he closed the door behind himself and tracked him as he walked past the rug he\u2019d curled up on and into the kitchen.  Not even a scritch hello?  Oh well.  Norman blinked again and went back to sleep.\n\nNorman wasted no time, going straight to his pots\u2019n\u2019pans cupboard.  He had to bend all the way down and peer deep inside to find the cast iron, languishing in a back corner.  He\u2019d bought it years ago at a garage sale, thinking enviously about Steve\u2019s boasting of how cast iron had changed his cooking entirely.  \u201cI never cook on anything else now!\u201d he\u2019d said proudly.  Norman had dreamed visions of perfectly cooked over-easy eggs as he\u2019d brought the pan home, imagining how he could boast his own boasts to Steve.  But his first few tests had resulted in scorched egg stuck to the pan, and he\u2019d quietly retired it to the back of the cupboard out of sight.  He hadn\u2019t mentioned it to Steve.\n\nHe rustled around til he found the pan, earning an ear twitch from Norman, then pulled it out triumphantly to inspect it.  It was a dark and dull grey with a rough surface sporting a ring of rust around the base.  Nothing like the gleaming pan that Steve had showed him.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to give you a new life, friend,\u201d Norman chuckled, dreaming again of perfect eggs.  He set the pan on the counter and dug out a used pad of steel wool from under the sink and set to work scrubbing off the rust \u2013 he\u2019d done his research and was prepared for this step, at least.  He inspected his work when he was done, feeling a twinge of anxiety at the fine mesh of lines that followed his circular scrubbing pattern.  It didn\u2019t look very impressive yet.  Swallowing his anxiety, he moved to preheat the oven, hesitating only for a moment before setting it to 425 Fahrenheit.  There had been a lot of contradicting information online about the definitive way to season a pan and he\u2019d felt lost reading it all, but he\u2019d ultimately settled on this for his first test.  He let the same hesitation pause his hand only for a moment before reaching past the canola to his small tub of vegetable shortening, quieting the nervous thought that questioned whether store brand was OK.  Next he took a generous smear of the shortening and rubbed it onto each surface of the pan with care, and then finally placed it with great reverence upside-down on the readied oven rack.  He\u2019d already placed a layer of foil on the lower rack to catch drips in preparation for just this moment, lest he again forget in his excitement.\n\nNorman set a timer and then sat for a moment with his hands on his hips in the silent kitchen until he felt slightly awkward, then decided to go take a nap with Norman.  But after a few minutes he realized he was too worked up to sleep, and so unfolded the morning\u2019s crossword instead, brow furrowing when he re-encountered the elusive 7 across.  He idly stroked Norman\u2019s head while he waited, checking his phone every so often for the time and anticipating the ding of the timer.  It was therefore no surprise when it chimed, but he acted as though it was a surprise anyway and got up quickly enough to startle Norman into an annoyed stare.\n\nHe opened the oven door to a plume of oily smoke and shut it again quickly.  Was that supposed to happen?  Norman gave a low meow of disapproval.  Norman\u2019s anxiety twinged again and he decided perhaps he should let everything cool overnight.  *Yes, best not to get ahead of ourselves,* he thought, and headed to bed.\n\nThe next morning Norman awoke a few minutes before his alarm went off but dutifully waited for the chime before he hopped out of bed, much like he had with the kitchen timer the night before.  He started toward his dresser but decided with a chuckle to indulge himself in a pajama breakfast instead.  He walked in slippered feet to the kitchen, started a pot of coffee, and got the carton of eggs out of the fridge, only to discover in horror that there was only one egg left.  He\u2019d forgotten to get more eggs!  *Well, nothing to help it now,* he thought, and pulled the pan out of the oven.  He frowned at it, thinking that while it did look better than it had before, it was still nothing like what Steve had shown him in that picture.  He set it to preheating, determined to cook his single egg in his \u2013 well, not-quite-shiny, not-quite-new \u2013 pan.\n\nTen minutes later, Norman regarded the pan with disappointment.  The egg had stuck and the yolk broke when he attempted to get the edge of his spatula underneath it.  The bottom of his pan was a mess of stuck dry egg, and there was nothing resembling an egg breakfast for him to serve.  He got his scratched teflon pan out of the cupboard, and then remembered the empty egg carton.  He sat with defeated shoulders for a moment in the silent kitchen until he felt slightly awkward.  And then he got dressed and went to McDonald\u2019s to get a drivethrough breakfast.\n\nOn the drive home, cruise control clocked precisely at the speed limit, Norman decided he wouldn\u2019t be mentioning this to Steve.  He took a bite of his egg sandwich with a sigh.  \"*Maybe it needs a few more coats of seasoning,\u201d* he thought, and then turned his eyes back to the road.  \n\n\nEdit: formatting","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1675637740.0,"comments":[{"author":"Maxwells_Demona","text":"This story was inspired by the recent activity in r\/castiron about [this redditor who put 80 layers of seasoning on their cast iron](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/castiron\/comments\/10izik8\/im_at_80_coats_now_dont_do_it_guys_this_is_just\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

It was the third time this week. He knew he would shortly need to have some 'me' time, so scooched the kitty out of his lap, much to his annoyance.  \n\nHe was reminded of the office birthday party where Steve P. had told him about his low-FODMAP diet, that he had to stick to for his Coeliac's. Something to do with complex sugars? Or maybe simple sugars. Or maybe...margarine? He couldn't remember. There were a lot of complicated rules, and some of them pertained to sugar. But Steve P. had seemed healthier and happier than before he gave up birthday cake, so Norman propped his elbows up on the foot of the bed and reached for his phone.   \n\nHe Binged \"low Fod-map foods\" and soon found himself on an American site for people with a host of digestive issues. He clicked on a page that promised a clear yes or no for diet followers as to whether a foodstuff was safe to eat with an uncooperative tummy.  \n\nThe list with a red background started off easily enough to comply with. He wasn't a fan of raw beetroot. He could cope without blackeye peas. He'd heard of kimchi and taro, but wasn't keen to try either, so was glad to see they were express no-no's. With the exception of sausage rolls, garlic and onions, and of course wheat he felt pretty confident about his chances of success in that department.    \n\nHe scrolled down to the green section, and realised that things got more complicated. Sure, he could have as many parsnips as he wanted, but only two Brussels sprouts? Was that per day? Per year? He didn't have the heart to tell his mother that her Christmas \"Belgian Surprise\" casserole might be part of the problem.    \n\nSomehow most of a cup of coconut was absolutely fine (his tummy politely disagreed) but cherry tomatoes should be avoided. He glanced worriedly at his seedlings under their propagation light, just now breaking the surface of the soil. He could go nuts on ackee and callaloo, whatever the heck those things were, and gorge himself on kangaroo (was that even legal?) but a good Fodmapper was satisfied with one sachet of ketchup. He frowned.  \n\nA few more moments of uncertain scrolling passed before his patience for this diet's ludicrous demands reached a breaking point. Norman closed the webpage and got up to water his plants, bristling.   \n\nWhat kind of ascetic monk could stop after 5 snow peas?","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675208505.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Norman\u2019s armchair","author":"PrimroseWoods","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/10q4qnu\/normans_armchair\/","text":"It had been many years since Norman had bought new furniture, and he really didn\u2019t intend on purchasing any now.

Jimmy had generously offered some snapdragons to Norm at that time, and Norman had unfortunately forgotten them on the way out. \n\nOne fine summer's day, Norman decided it had been too long since he'd seen his friend. It'd been a few months, Norm had gotten busy at work and sadly didn't have *any* spare time. So he made some spare time and began the walk to Jimmy's. \"Norman, you're in charge. But no jumping on the benches and no tearing into the food bags.\" Norman the Human told Norman the Cat, \"I'm heading to Jimmy's, be good.\" \n\n\"Meow.\" \n\n\"Good boy.\" \n\nAs Norman the human left with a couple plastic bags for the snappies, he was thinking about that glorious gold koi. He was quite taken by it, it was rather glorious. Norman was never someone to have a fish tank, they do get expensive and can be quite time consuming. But he always liked to gawk at Jimmy's fish. \n\nAfter a throughly non-eventful walk, which he guessed is a good thing in a way, Norman rang the doorbell to Jimmy's house after taking a minute to enjoy the glorious gold and the resplendent raspberry coloured koi. \n\n*Ding-dong*\n\n\"Heya Norm, been a minute.\" Jimmy was happy to see Norman, he always was. \n\n\"Yeah, yeah, it's been too long in my mind.\" Norman was somewhat disappointed in himself for not making the time sooner, and it showed in his voice. \n\n\"Hey no worries, I heard you've been busy through your work. I've been too.\" Jimmy said, \" Anyways come in, come in.\" \n\n\"Yes I wouldn't mind getting out of this sun.\" Norman was always aware of the ever present threat of skin cancer, and although cancer didn't run in his family, he always wore a hat to protect his balding head. \n\nOnce inside and with a glass of nice, cool, ice water each, and chit-chatting away about this that and the other, Norman asked about the guppies he'd bought for Jimmy for his birthday. \n\n\"I still have some, though not as many as last time you were here. I traded a few in to the fish shop because I had so many. I kept the originals of course.\" He explained that process too, but it's a bit boring to explain here. It involves a lot of swirling a net around and a lot of getting splashed. \n\nNorman was always proud of his friend breeding these fish, \"Do you mind if we go have a quick look at them?\" \n\n\"No of course not, I like showing your fish off!\" Jimmy laughed a bit, what a silly question! Asking if he can see the fish he bought! Of course Norm can! Through to the converted office fish-room they went. Once inside Norman gawked at the angelfish and marveled at the school of tetras. And of course spent too long watching the swirls of colours from those guppies. They reminded him of those snappies too. \n\n\"Ooh Jim, do you mind if I grab a snappie on the way out?\" Norman had bought some potted colour, but always left a space for Jimmy's snappie. \n\n\"No, go ahead. They're getting a bit crowded and need thinning out anyway.\" He replied kindly, \"I'll grab a trowel and something to put it in. You can make your way out front yeah?\"\n\nAnd so they left the bubbling, humid fish-room, to the searing sun of outside. Once there, Jimmy found his friend in the shade of the veranda, watching the world go by. \"Norm! What colour do you want?\" \n\n\"Have you got blue ones?\" asked Norman, now standing with Jim by the snappie patch. \n\n\"Yeah yeah, course I do. Right here on the end by the fence.\" Now at the end of the snappie patch, Jim began to dig a nice plant out. \"Have you got something to put it in?\" \n\nNorm said nothing, but trotted off to the front door to grab his plastic bag. By the time he got back Jimmy had the plant out, ready for transport. \"Thanks bud. I appreciate that.\" Time had of course gotten away on them, \"But I think I should be off. The days getting old and the cat will be tearing into his food bags by now. I told him not too but he's a free spirit.\"\n\nJimmy agreed, \"I better put dinner on too. I'll see you soon, I'll come over to yours next time!\" \n\n\"You're always welcome, and thanks for the the snappie!\" Norm was very happy he finally found a blue snappie.

He stretched and made his way to the kitchen to get his morning routine going.\n\nHe started his day with a big cup of coffee, which helped to get his head in the right space. He sat down and got to work, setting goals and planning out his day. He usually liked to start off with something productive so he could feel accomplished early on. He worked through his to-do list, crossing off each task one by one.\n\nOnce he was done with the work related stuff, he would usually take some time to catch up with current events or read something inspiring. He had always been looking for ways to stay informed and inspired. Knowledge was power, after all. He often liked to take a break and go for a walk or take a quick jog.\n\nThe physical activity helped to clear his head and he could come back feeling ready to tackle the day. For lunch, he would usually make something healthy and nutritious. Eating healthy had always been key to living a balanced and productive lifestyle. After lunch, he would spend some time catching up with friends and family.\n\nStaying connected with the people Norman cared about was an important part of his life. They talked about all sorts of things - from work to hobbies, from the latest news to shared childhood memories. It was a nice bonding moment that helped to keep him sane in this busy world.\n\nIn the afternoon, Norman spent some time relaxing and unwinding. He usually watches a movie, catches up on reading, or just takes a nap. This is also the time when he likes listening to music. Music has always been a form of escape for him and it helps to center him and get inspired.\n\nAs the evening rolled in, INorman took some time to reflect and think about what he had achieved throughout the day. He found himself thinking back on all the decisions he had made, how he had made them, and how he could make them better the next time around.\n\nNorman ended the day by getting ready for bed. He made sure all his to-dos for the next day were written down and he took a few moments to appreciate all the good things that had come his way. Norman made it through another day, and he always felt a sense of accomplishment and pride.\n\nHe crawled into bed and closed his eyes, ready for the day ahead. He was content with the knowledge that he had given it his all that day, and that he was one step closer to achieving his goals.

He can hear it, its gears ticking behind its curved glass face and those snaking black numbers counting down the day into night. \n\n\"Side effects are rare with this. Worst you'll get are vivid dreams.\" \n\nDoctor Thurman sits straight. Years of discipline at Philips Exeter, Norman thought. Probably Philips Exeter. He talks to Norman with his eyes strained at the matrix chart. Maybe at some younger age there had been wildness in him. Now he sits, rinsed and distilled, as Doctor Thurman. \n\n\"Sometimes, you might get a metallic taste. Right in the back of your throat. It's nothing to worry about.\"\n\nNorman slipped into his pin-stripped work shirt, wearing it before his jeans.\n\n\"Scope. Just a quick rinse. That usually helps.\"\n\nThat night Norman lay motionless in his bed and dreamt, his chest rising and falling like a stuck pump.\n\nNorman had been here, in the clearing above the cliffs, for months now. Snow fall had come and seized the lemon grass off the loamy soiled ground which now stood frozen like Yukon tundra. He had seen thunderheads looming like holy spirits over the coast, and five or six weeks past it had snowed hard enough to snap the bamboo rods holding their tents together. The snowfall had lessened in steps and in the passing week had stopped dead all together. Now, the gray sky cleared and lapis from end to end, embankments of the white powder had begun to slump. Water, opaque and viscous, flowed heavy through small canal ways and streams, breaking into marbled mist over the edges of the cliff. He would watch the stream turn to streaked thoughts of cloud, carried by some phantom wind.\n\nLater, after the white foam waves of salt water had cleared the sluiceways and left the cement paths shining like cracked glass, he had come out of his dwelling (a makeshift room of eight-feet dug out from under a rising slump of grassy Earth) and watched the sea beyond the cliff precipices roll in slowed time. Rolling waves out there in the dark ocean, glinting chips of dying sunlight in their rises. Waves probably fifteen or twenty feet in length, crashing in droves and driving all manner of sea debris, mostly bottles of plastic and glass and driftwood, towards the black beaches below. She had been there, her hair damp and darker now in the low sun rimming red those mountains laying far west. Her clothes, ripped and shredded, must have been wet and stinging, he thought, as they half clung, half fluttered in the rising winds. They were fierce, twisting the cirrus's just above into swirls of thin, black-gray ribbon. More would come, filling in the starless sky, now sea dark, and bring rain to thaw the frozen ground.\n\nShe turned to him suddenly, moving in step like an alley cat. He strained to see her but she blurred like fogged glass.\n\nShe spoke.\n\n\"You know, there are places here like old spirits. These white washed souls spread against the rocks at the bottom of the river bed. Down in those brined lots where tunnels form and twist, empty and full of air. Down here, by the Earth and its secret places where we had lived.\"\n\nMuffled, as if she had been speaking from behind a bricked wall.\n\nShe walked past him, her clothes fluttering. Brushing past, he watched her and as she slunk towards the dwelling he had made under the grass slope, he saw it change into the confines of a desert-town motel room. Two beds straddled the walls, a mirror body length stood against the back. She entered the room in bright silk nightwear and turned, her eyes like the skies he had seen when he was younger and away from all the cruelty and edges of life. Almond shaped channels tuned to obsidian black She invited him in.\n\n\"Out there you're the lines of some fairy tale book that ends bad. Like some Western Book of the Dead.\"\n\nHe walked the length between them and stood by her, feeling her heat. Robbing it, he felt. She leaned him in and sunk teeth ivory white into the soft ramp of his neck and the world turned dark like someone had turned all his lights off.\n\nNorman awoke, his dream clear to him like blue sky. He hurried to find a pen and paper but by the time Norman got to his desk he had forgotten why he had come.\n\nNorman got ready, rinsing his mouth with Scope. \n\n\"Usually does the trick.\" He said, and in minutes Norman's house was empty, save Norman who lay stretched out against a sliver of sun, dreaming vividly.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674268719.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Norman walks through the park","author":"yankonapc","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/10gho9y\/norman_walks_through_the_park\/","text":"\"'Scuse me!\"   \n\nNorman stepped to the side for a moment and allowed a jogger to bustle past him on the path.

He would have gotten store brand \u2014 Norman wasn\u2019t too particular about his tea \u2014 but there had been a promotion at the grocery store, and this assortment of various breakfast teas cost less than his usual.\n\nBut alas! There was one last sad, lonely tea bag at the bottom of his previous box which he had missed completely. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll just have to try the new stuff next time,\u201d Norman told himself, trying not to seem too glum. After all, it was just tea.\n\nHe opened the cupboard and reached for a mug. His usual mug \u2014 a plain white mug that had once advertised a university, but had now faded to intelligible lettering \u2014 was not there. It was probably in the dishwasher. \n\nFeeling lazy, Norman reached further and found another mug at the back of the cupboard. It was a DIY Father\u2019s Day mug, no doubt from Norman Jr.\u2019s primary school days. The mug was innocent, but a wave of sadness came over him. He felt like he was snooping, even though he\u2019s lived alone in this house for quite a few years now.\n\nSuddenly he didn\u2019t really want tea anymore. Feeling a bit distraught, Norman exclaimed, \u201cGet ahold of yourself, Norman, it\u2019s just a mug!\u201d\n\nThe kettle whistled, interrupting his thoughts. Norman put the mug back into the cupboard. Then he made himself tea in his usual mug and settled back into his armchair. \n\nNorm the kitty was still snoozing, and his little snores were soft and calming.

A dozen posts supposedly about him, with titles like \u201cNorm buys a Coke,\u201d \u201cNorm takes a walk,\u201d \u201cThe CIA has a problem only Norm can solve.\u201d John seemed pleased with himself.\n\nNorm chuckled politely, \u201cit\u2019s about time I got some recognition.\u201d As far as John\u2019s practical jokes went, this was decent enough. Maybe too much effort for too little pay off. \n\n\u201cWhat, you think it\u2019s me? I\u2019m serious, Norm, you\u2019ve got a following!\u201d\n\n\u201cUff da, well let\u2019s see what \u2018*they*\u2019 have to say about me.\u201d \n\nPutting on his reading glasses, he scanned some of the posts. He didn\u2019t like the emphasis on his bald head. He wasn\u2019t bald, he was *balding*. There was a difference. It seemed more mean than funny. He was about to dismiss John\u2019s prank completely when he saw a mention of his ex-wife. He bristled and mumbled something about getting back to work. At his own cubicle, Norm quietly opened the page on his own computer.\n\nAs he scrolled through the posts, he came to an unnerving realization: John couldn\u2019t have know any of these things about him. Norm was decidedly private. The most he let on about his marriage was a picture of his wife on his desk, and the most he let on about his divorce was moving that picture to the drawer below his monitor. He never talked about his kid. He\u2019d even stopped telling people about his cat because he didn\u2019t like explaining how it got its name. He also realized the page had been up since before he and John had worked in the office. It had been up longer than anyone, save Lisa, had worked there, and Lisa couldn\u2019t type 10 words per minute. \n\nMany of the stories weren\u2019t factually true but had a few essential details. In most, he lived somewhere else or did something else, but they always touched upon the truth. They captured the essence of him, his mannerisms, the simplicity of his life.\n\nFeeling dizzy, Norm left work early. The whole way home, he felt watched. Strangers on the sidewalk, employees in storefronts, security cameras. Was it his cell phone? He remembered something about the NSA watching people. But this seemed like a poor use of their time.\n\nAt home, his cup of tea grew cold while he scrolled through more semi-fictional stories of his life. He looked for patterns in the writing styles, hidden codes, anything that offered a clue of who may have wrote these, and why. But after reading more than a hundred stories, his worry changed to something else. \n\nSeeing his truth written so honestly in each post, he began to feel something besides embarrassment and vulnerability. These stories weren\u2019t just about his balding scalp or his timidness. Beyond that, he saw his love for small comforts, his quiet moments, his ability to keep going. His life, boring as it was at times, was sincere. Whoever was writing and rewriting his life didn\u2019t do it to disparage him. They were almost memorializing him. Norm began to feel a bit of pride. He wasn\u2019t being watched, he was being seen. He felt gratitude for the sympathy that shined through these tales.\n\nStill, he wasn\u2019t *that* bald.\n\nNorman the cat meowed his meal-time meow. Norm the human laughed. There were more important things to worry about. One Norman walked and one sprinted towards the wet catfood cabinet.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1671471733.0,"comments":[{"author":"Zoloft_and_the_RRD","text":"Shoutout to this sub for giving me anything else to think about because I'm losing my mind.","upvotes":30,"created_utc":1671472952.0},{"author":"king_england","text":"Write more.

It had been a very stressful time for him and for Norman -the-cat lately; but little did he know, things were about to get much worse.\n\nNorman stood under the warm water, letting it relax him and his tired mind and body,  but then of course at the end he switched it to cold water, to give him a bit of an energizing jolt. He only did this in times where he needed a lot of extra energy and vigor (his colleague, James, had suggested an energy drink, of all things, but Norman was much too afraid of injesting such hard substances; the cold-water shower [well, rinse] was almost always enough; even though it wasnt very pleasant, he did get a jolt of energy at the end). \n\nReinvigorated, Norman carefully reached over the the towel rack for his bath sheet, and wound himself up in it. Norm-the-cat sat at the bathroom doorway chiding Norman, his meows alternately pitiful and reproving. \"Yes, yes, Mr. Norm, I'm coming\" said Norman. \"My apologies for this unprecedented interruption of our routine, old friend, but I was feeling quite out of sorts.\" \n\nFor last week, Norman's mother had called  to  tell him that she had slipped on the sidewalk at her friend Ginny's, after having \"a tot too much gin\" and  broken a hip and was thus headed to surgery and therefore needed Norman to move in with her for the next 3 or 4 months to help her out , since she couldn't walk. \n\nThis  news had stressed Norman immensely, so much so that he had actually exclaimed \"HEAVENS, Mother!\" and then had rushed to  apologize for cursing at his mother; after which he said he would, of course, come help, since that's what sons do in such cases. \n\nHe had been preparing and packing up what he and Norman would need since then; and today was to be the day of the big (temporary) move.\n It had been such a welter of details - supervising movers, notifying his landlord, shutting off utilities,holding his mail, suspending his newspaper subscription, and so on (he would be back, but not for months, so these things had to be attended to)- and so by the time that all he needed to do was load Norman and his food\/bed\/toys\/litterbox\/supplies\/etc, plus himself and his overnite bag, and drive to his mother's (an hour away;Norman highly dreaded the daily commute), he had needed some time to himself to calm down and de-stress; hence the shower.\n\n\nSo now Norman stepped onto the bathmat; but in his rush to get dressed and feed Norman, he wasn't as careful as he usually was & and should have been on the slippery tile. The wet mat slipped, and Norman fell heavily, his left leg and foot bent out sideways the wrong way at the knee (so that his left foot was torqued out and up by his hip). \n\nNorman had never felt such pain. He yelped aloud and startled Norman away. \n\nWhen he finally regained some composure,he was able to drag himself to his mobile phone on the sink countertop and dial 999. Before the medics arrived, he managed-in great pain - to still drag on his underclothes, slacks and shirt, bc he couldn't imagine the humiliation of NOT doing so.  This forced several more yips out of him, and he hoped he wasn't disturbing any of his neighbors at the ungodly hour of 8pm. \n\nHe was taken to the same hospital as his mother; and after he explained things to the staff, he and his mother shared a convalescent room for a few days, then went home with a nurse to help them both heal during the 4 months she and Norman lived together. \n\n\"It's a very good thing I was already all packed up and had arrangements made before I got injured\". Norman had thought to himself as he was wheeled out to the ambulance. \"Imagine the mess if I hadn't! And now I won't even have to commute.

Most nights, seemingly all other nights, he drifted off into a restful slumber within moments of lying down next to his cat, Norman, whose gentle purr lulled both of them to sleep.\n\nBut tonight was different, and Norman realized he hadn't confirmed whether his tea at lunch was decaffeinated. Surely, this was why he was still awake. \"I really shouldn't be so neglectful next time,\" he thought.\n\nAt the foot of the bed, Norman the cat lay sound asleep, his face resting on a single paw that edged just slightly off the bed. Norman gently nudged him away from danger, and little Norm stretched out before dozing off once again. Norman smiled and then sighed, acknowledging his envy.\n\nUnsure of what to do, Norman thought he might tire himself out with a bit of television before lying back down. It was already past 10, so he hoped it wouldn't take long. He flipped through channels but he didn't like all the commotion, so he decided to watch whatever returned on the current channel he landed at, which to Norman's discomfort was showing a commercial about a hair loss supplement.\n\nAt last, the ad ended, and an old sitcom, \"Cheers,\" played on the screen. Norman remembered his parents watching the show when it aired all those years ago. He always felt the show was a bit rowdy, but enjoyed the laughter it brought his parents. \n\nHe set the volume just loud enough to hear the dialogue, and nervously chuckled at the quips and jabs traded among the cast. After a while, the show broke for commercials, showing another hair growth ad. To Norman's dismay, this particular commercial was much louder than the rest of the channel. He rushed to mute the TV but fumbled with the remote control and it fell back onto the coffee table. Norman slammed his eyes shut and let out an exasperated sigh, hoping he hadn't disturbed anyone in his apartment building at such an hour.\n\nThe ruckus was just loud enough to awaken Norman the cat, who grew at once nervous of his owner's absence. He stretched and yawned, and then plopped down on the floor. From the hallway, noticed the walls reflect a soft flickering of light from the television screen and garbled recorded voices. He tiptoed toward the living room.\n\nAt last, the obnoxious commercial ended, and the third act had begun. Norman sat back, relieved, as the scene played. From outside the bar, a man entered and greeted the patrons.\n\n\"Afternoon, everybody,\" he said.\n\nThe cast howled in a familiar chorus, \"NORM!!!\"\n\nThe group's roar startled Norman once more, and he hoped it wouldn't keep him awake longer still. But just then, Norman the cat let out a soft meow at his feet and leaped from the floor into his lap. He purred as he curled up to lie down, both now reassured there wasn't anything to worry about after all.\n\nNorman smiled and said, \"Heh, look at that, buddy.

I'm so excited!\"\n\nNorman felt a pang of jealousy as he watched Mary leave. He wished he could have the courage to make a change in his own life.\n\nThat night, as he was laying in bed, Norman made a decision. He was going to take control of his life and make a change.\n\nOver the next few months, Norman started going to the library more often and reading more books.

She smiled excitedly and waved to the office at large before skipping off to the next department.  \n\n\"Oh, lovely!\" Norman thought, putting his coat back onto its hook. He didn't often visit the office canteen, as it followed the same menu every week and got redundant. If he wanted the same thing every day he could get a cheese sandwich from one of the local shops for half the price.  \n\nHe took the stairs to the canteen level and saw that the queue wound out the door and down the corridor. He craned his neck along its length but didn't see anyone that he knew, at least not well. Alan from Accounts was about ten places from the rear, but they'd only met once, back in June, and anyway he was chatting with someone. Nevermind.   \n\nHe waited patiently as people came past him with plates piled high with stuffing and sprouts, smothered in gravy. His mouth began to water.  Turkey and cranberry, seasonal roasted veg, perfect, golden roasties, all heading into the seating area. He played a word game on his phone while the queue gradually shortened.  \n\nAs he approached the counter he noticed the tureen that was usually used for mulled wine was full of soup. It looked like nice soup, but he wondered where they were keeping it this year.  \n\nWhen Norman's turn arrived he asked for the vegetarian meal and was provided a cardboard clamshell box filled with seasonal vegetables, spanikopita, and plenty of gravy. He glanced around behind the line worker before sheepishly asking if he could have some mulled wine.   \n\n\"Mulled wine? We're not doing that this year. We've got coffee if you want.\" came the reply.  \n\n\"Oh, I, er, I thought I saw people with some, is all.\" he stammered.  \n\n\"Oh yeah, the HR girls had a bottle. I had to stop them putting it in the microwave. I gave them a bowl, probably tasted gross but at least it was safe.\" the server confided.  \n\n\"Oh. Oh! Good catch.\" Norman found himself a strange combination of taken aback and disappointed, which was better than being plain old disappointed, he supposed.  \n\nHe paid for his festive meal, declined the coffee, checked his watch and realised he only had ten minutes before he needed to be in a Zoom meeting. He scurried towards his floor.  \n\nBack in his cubicle he placed his damp, compostable food container on top of the filing cabinet and opened it. It still looked pretty good, if he was honest. No one else was in the office yet, so he put on his headphones and rummaged around the internet until he found a recording of Greensleeves performed on classical guitar.

It was a Saturday morning, weekend was here.\nA small part of his life where Norman was at peace. \n\nCalling Norman shy would be an understatement. Norman is what you get when you imagine an anxious Redditor who spends more time in r\/depression than any other sub. Social skill are not his forte. \n\nHe had a decent job in IT that paid bills. Most of his coworkers didn\u2019t even know he existed. Norman was not the brightest, he was bang average at everything. Nothing really stood out about him. Coupled with his anxiety and general shyness, having no hobbies and not being good at anything led to Norman having no friends. None at all.\n\nWeekdays were hell for Norman. He had to spend the day amongst 50 strangers, who some might refer as colleagues. Some of them tried to include Norman in their group activities like when they were going to grab a few beers after work, only to realise how futile it was.\n\nWeekends were the only time when Norman got to be himself without being anxious or self conscious. His usually weekend consisted of binging a movie or series all night, waking up during the middle of the day and preparing a nice meal for himself.\n\nAlthough he was alone, with no friends or partner, Norman led a pretty contended life in his own way. He was happy with himself and really enjoyed the time he spent with himself. \n\nLike last weekend and all weekends before, Norman woke up after midday on Saturday. He took the same route he always takes to the grocery store to get supplies for the week ahead. He came back home, he made his favourite lasagna. A hot water bath and pamper day was all he needed. He ate the lasagna and went about the his usual binge routine.\n\nBefore he realised it was Sunday evening. Although he dreaded the week ahead, he felt thankful for the weekend he had.\n\nEven with nothing happening in his life, no world travel, no parties, no gatherings, no friends to talk to, he was content.

Checking the time once again, he sees it now reads 10:17 P.M. He thought about his son. Had he been a good father? He certainly had tried his best, done what any normal patent would do, but still the self-doubt always lingered. Norman decided he would try and keep in touch with his son more. He scribbled a note to call his son in the morning on his notepad, which he kept on his bedside table in order to write down late night thoughts. \n\nNorman had had enough, and decided that drastic times called for drastic measures. He opened the table drawer and fished around for the bottle of melatonin, which he saved specially for situations like this (Norman had always been afraid that melatonin would affect his sleep schedule.)

He waited in line, the ten dollars in his hand ready to be given to the barista. As he approached the front of the line he held the ten dollars out, his hunger and thirst becoming unbearable. Finally, the barista took it away with her nicely manicured hand. \u201cThank you,\u201d Norman said through parched lips. \u201cThe barista put in the order on the iPad in front of her.\n\nAfter being sated, Norman decided to take the long way back home. He would pass by the park and maybe he would have a stroll under the trees which were changing color as the Fall approached. It truly was \u201cFall Vibes.\u201d He had heard the term on the TV, some sitcom said \u201cFall Vibes\u201d. He had been saying the phrase in his head since then. When he exited his house to his car every day and the wind whipped at his face he silently and obediently said, \u201cFall Vibes\u201d. When he saw pumpkin spice beers offered at the brewery he frequented, \u201cFall Vibes\u201d. When he noticed his husband was watching a football game. \u201cFall Vibes\u201d.\n\nHe walked to the park and breathed in the crisp Autumn air, silently saying underneath his breath, \u201cFall Vibes\u201d. He saw a man on the opposite side of the park. He was also dressed in a Star Wars tee, receding hairline parted to one side, wearing pajama bottoms to the park even though he was in his mid 30s. He walked up to the doppelganger. As he approached he noticed the man\u2019s eyes were closed, soaking up the moment, then saying silently under his breath, \u201cFall Vibes\u201d. He looked just like Norman.\n\n\u201cExcuse me sir.\u201d\n\nThe doppelganger opened his eyes, surprised that someone was talking to him. Because of this he wasn\u2019t aware of what Norman had just said.\n\nThe doppelganger said, \u201cExcuse me, sorry, but what did you just say?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh it\u2019s all my fault. I just wanted to say you sure do look an awful lot like me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah, I can see the resemblance.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you get an Americano and a muffin every day at the coffee shop on Main?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you know that?\u201d\n\nNorman took out a knife and stabbed the doppelganger to death. He hated the doppelganger for it reminded him of the weakest parts of himself. He then threw the knife in the lake that was at the center of the park. A leaf fell from one of the trees and landed on Norman\u2019s head. Norman grabbed it and a tear slid down his face. \u201cFall Vibes,\u201d he said.","upvote_ratio":0.73,"created_utc":1669416292.0,"comments":[{"author":"captyes","text":"Had forgot about this place; y\u2019all got dark.","upvotes":7,"created_utc":1669438818.0},{"author":"NoahDavenport","text":"Been a while Norman, my dear friend","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1669449102.0}]},{"title":"Norman Goes to the DMV","author":"Jaded_Pomegranate_77","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/z3zd31\/norman_goes_to_the_dmv\/","text":"\u201cOh great,\u201d Norman complained, \u201cI had to use part of my PTO to do the most boring activity known to man.\u201d Norman looked straight at the camera, \u201cI have to go to the DMV!\u201d\nThe DMV was next to a Chipotle and a McDonalds, \u201cWell thankfully I can get lunch afterwards. I just have to make the decision on if I want to splurge on Chipotle or suffer in the bathroom after eating at McDonalds.\u201d Norman thought it was worth it to spend a few more bucks on the Chipotle. He heard on the evening news that Chipotle used all organic ingredients and he liked that they put in the extra effort to make quality meals.\nThere was a long line when he walked in but not too long. Good thing he got there early or maybe the line would be out the door. It took about 20 minutes to get to the front of the line. He brought his passport and his driver\u2019s license as instructed on the letter he got in the mail.\n\u201cThis passport is expired,\u201d the DMV lady said in a monotone voice.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t still use it?\u201d He hadn\u2019t seen anything on the letter saying the passport couldn\u2019t be expired.\n\u201cCome back with your Social Security card.\u201d\nIncredulously Norman took his passport back and slinked out of the DMV. Government bureaucrats, he thought, the most masochistic people on the planet. He calculated the amount of time it would take to drive back home and get his social security card, then return and wait in an even longer line, then drive home. He had skipped breakfast in order to get there early and now he wouldn\u2019t be out there until the afternoon. The thought of Chipotle dwelled on his mind.\nHe waited in line once more until he got to the front facing the same bureaucrat. He neatly placed the social security card and driver\u2019s license on the desk in front of her. The bureaucrat scrutinized it then seeing it was to her specifications returned the documents to Norman. \u201cYou\u2019ll get your new license in the mail in about two weeks,\u201d she said.\nNorman went to Chipotle afterwards. It was almost empty. He thought, \u201cPeople must lose their appetite after dealing with the drudgery of the DMV.\u201d\nHe sat down with his burrito and dug in. He could really taste the organic pinto beans, grown free of pesticides. Sure, the risk of getting sick was greater, but which was worse, possibly getting food poisoning or never eating Chipotle?

The only thing that kept him going was Lucy. Norman has been married to Lucy for over three years and had  dated her for another four. \n\nHe could still remember the day he met her. The bright yellow coloured sun dress she wore which stopped just short of her knee, how her curly hair was flowing with the wind and gently caressed her shoulder, the radiant smile that seemed like it could lift anyone up no matter how horrible their day was, her animated way of speaking that might lead someone to think she was from one of those Japanese comics that featured girls with disproportionate body sizes. \n\nIt took Norman a full 2 months to muster up the courage to say two letters to her. Norman had always been the timid little nerd who shied away from any attention he got. School and college life were not the best years of his life. He got bullied for being a nerd and took solace in the classroom and academic advancement. Later did he realise, after graduating top of his class in both high school and his Ivy League college that his marks mattered not, as he wasn\u2019t interested in becoming an academician. His more social peers who were not the brightest were able to climb the rings very quickly, whereas Norman\u2019s social ineptitude hampered his growth as his teammates complained that he was not a \u2018great person\u2019 to work with. Norman took it as jealousy because of his \u2018superior intellect\u2019.\n\nNone of that mattered now. He was going home to Lucy. A hug from her could cure any ailment. The way she cared for him and how she never seemed to be bothered by his weirdness made Norman\u2019s life bearable. That\u2019s all he ever wanted and all he ever needed.\n\nHe went home that day with flowers in his hand, the same chrysanthemums that she loved, only to find an empty house. He realised that today was the day Lucy had her team event and that she wouldn\u2019t be back until mid night.\n\nNorman turned on the playstation to blow off some steam. But what waited for him was a gruelling session of being flamed by 13 year olds. Norman took a bath and fixed himself some dinner. He browse through the notifications on his phone and was surprised to see that Lucy has been live for over 30mins now. Although Lucy was more outgoing than Norman, she was not exactly a butterfly. Her being live meant the work event was mind-blowing. \n\nNorman opened the app, only to find a dimly lit hotel room and what seemed like 2 people having sex. His first thought was that her phone got hacked and someone is playing a porno. Once his eyes adjusted,the 2 people seemed very familiar. \n\nNorman couldn\u2019t believe it was Lucy and her ex boyfriend Ethan. Norman thought it was Ethan, with whom Lucy wasn\u2019t in the best of terms, as it was her who cheated on him with someone else. Although Lucy never talked about this, Ethan had reached out to Norman and Norman just brushed it up as a crazy ex looking for revenge. \nNorman immediately called Lucy to tell her that Ethan was somehow live streaming their old sex tape from her account. He was beyond shocked to see that in the livestream, Lucy picked up the phone and talked to him. Norman realised that this was indeed live and Lucy was with Ethan. Ethan had somehow managed to login to Lucy\u2019s insta in his phone and was live streaming.\n\nNorman\u2019s head started spinning. Whatever he thought was the only good thing he had in his life had just turned to dust. His love, his wife, his Lucy was cheating on him. \n\nFelt like the sky crashed down on Norman\u2019s head. Norman was beyond shattered. He was angry, sad, confused and in some part guilty. He started thinking what could he have done that drove Lucy to cheat. Was he not caring?, was he not doting on her?, was he not providing enough? He was never this angry and confused before. He feared he might hit her. As he was processing all this, he couldn\u2019t stop his tears from pouring down. He wept. He wept till she was home.\n\n He screamed at her and showed her the video and said shes better off dead than being a slut.\n\nHe stormed out with only thing in mind being \u2018divorce\u2019. \nHe expected it to be a messy court battle with a lot of alimony, but Lucy surprisingly agreed to grant him divorce without alimony. Maybe she felt guilty.\n\nNorman was lost once again. He had nothing to look forward to in his life. Norman went to the seventeenth floor of his building and stood on the ledge, with conflicting thoughts as to whether he should jump or not. He decided that he had no role to play as it was all Lucy\u2019s choice. He was the not the reason for her cheating on him. He didn\u2019t have to fell violated and lied to.

He thought to himself that he would quite like to visit the mountains someday. \n\nBut there wasn\u2019t much time for daydreaming. He stood up to stretch his legs. As he sauntered around the office, the shiny red vending machine caught his eye. Typically Norman wouldn\u2019t be tempted by empty calories, but he had woken up late that morning, so hadn\u2019t had time for breakfast. \n\nHe approached the metal rectangle and perused the options. Veggie straws for $2.50. Quaker granola bar for just $0.99. And available in two flavors, too. But the more he thought about it, Norman decided if he was going to patronize the vending machine, he should go big or go home. \n\nHe allowed his gaze to drift to the Cheetos and Famous Amos. He\u2019d bought Famous Amos the last time he stopped at the vending machine, several years ago, and was unsettled to see the price had increased by $0.75. He decided there weren\u2019t enough cookies in one of those tiny bags to justify the cost. \n\nFinally, he settled on a pack of Ritz Peanutbutter Sandwich Crackers. They were a nostalgic favorite from his childhood and came eight to a pack. He watched, transfixed, as the metal ring rotated until the crackers dropped off into the receptacle. \n\nHe reached in, struggling against the somewhat sticky swinging opening, and retrieved his treat. He returned to his desk eager to dig in. \n\nNorman savored the crackers, licking the peanutbutter out of the inside of most.  He was diligent to not get any crumbs in his workspace. He decided to save the very last cracker for later as an added bright spot to the day. \n\nFeeling re-energized and satiated, Norman contently returned to work.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1668900165.0,"comments":[{"author":"lovestheautumn","text":"This is really good, I love it!","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1668936752.0},{"author":"ThusSpokeGaba","text":"Phew!

He always heard red was too intimidating, so he opted for the sensible black pen. He'd once bought a Montblanc in Spain when he'd gone on vacation with his ex-wife. It was nice. But then he lost it on the plane home and all he'd written with it was a postcard to his mother talking about the Basilica La Sagrada Familia. It was nice, he'd said. He'd even taken some nice photos with his Canon EOS 50D DSLR and published them on his blog. He wasn't a Catholic, but it was beautiful anyways. He always told everyone about it when he went in to the office early on Friday. \n\nThe survey wasn't filling itself out, though. \"Norman,\" he thought, \"you've got to get a hold of yourself. This survey isn't filling itself out, is it?\" He read the first question: What was your first impression of the room you stayed in? He thought about this. It was a small hotel room he'd stayed in and everything had been spick span. He always liked those minature soaps and shampoos. He collected those for if there was ever an emergency. There never was. \n\n*It was very spacious and I liked the aqua comforter. The on demand movie I watched was Ken Burns' Jazz. It was very interesting seeing the origins of jazz going back to New Orleans. I also enjoyed using the hand towels since they were very plush. The modern art was a nice touch too.* \n\nNumber two: Would you recommend Augustine luxury hotels to friends or family? He thought about it a moment. \n\n*I would if I knew anyone who was traveling. I don't know anyone who travels though, and most my family lives several hundred miles away and I haven't had a chance. I think I would recommend for the continental breakfast. I liked peeling the cinnamon rolls and the turkey bacon was a nice healthy alternative to go with my blueberry greek yogurt.* \n\nThree: What could we improve to make your next stay even more comfortable? \n\n*I don't want to be too critical of it since so much care was put into the cleaning of the bed sheets and towels and carpet and such. It would be nice to have a radio to listen to my favorite morning radio shows on but that's minor. I also think there should be rubber mat under the rolling chairs to prevent wear on the lovely geometric orange and blue carpet. Overall I was very comfortable and felt well taken care of.* \n\n*Thank you for your response to our survey.

The one he'd tried on a few weeks ago was still there. He checked that the belt was still in place, and took a second to ensure that the zip to remove the lining moved smoothly. Excellent.   \n\nThe next rack to the left held a selection of Italian greatcoats, including a flashy blue Air Force issue one that he secretly coveted but would never, ever try on. The shoulders were huge, the waist was tiny, and the brass buttons demanded *Look At Me!* So he looked.    \n\nIt was also twice the price of the Gabardine and was made of pure wool, two qualities that made Norman break out in hives.   \n\nHe remembered his objective and selected his jacket from the rack.

The need to pee became greater than the need to stay in bed. He switched on the light and felt a sting in his eyes for a second. He checked his phone, no new messages. He was so used to getting messages from friends, or emails from work when he looked at his phone that a little wave of lonelyness briefly washed over him. He went to the Bathroom. After using the toilet he looked at himself in the mirror. He smiled at his reflection. He noticed that he needed to shave again. He always felt a little bored when shaving and decided to continue listening to a podcast on a phone while doing it. \n\nStill in his pijamas he went to the kitchen. He was thursty so the first thing he did was drinking a glass of water. Then he made himself a bowl of cornflakes. He checked the time: 11:00. He felt a little guilty for getting up this late. He decided to not use his phone during breakfast and focusing on the moment instead. \n\nNorman went back into his sleeping chamber, to get dressed.

Just as he was finishing up a game of Minesweeper, a coworker walked by with a candy bar in hand. *Gosh, I could sure use a candy bar right now,* thought Norman. In a hurry, he'd forgotten to eat breakfast that morning.\n\nNorman had no cash in his wallet, but he knew a chocolate bar from the office's vending machine cost exactly $1. He looked around his desk for any spare change he could find, and after digging in the bottom of his pencil jar, he came up with three quarters, two dimes, and a nickel. *Just enough.* Norman briefly fist-pumped to himself.\n\nNorman walked to the vending machine in the break room and weighed out his options. While he thought a plain chocolate bar was too boring, a chocolate bar with more than two main ingredients could be rather busy for Norman's stomach so early in the day. He eventually fixed his attention on a Crunch bar. Milk chocolate and rice was a simple, yet tasty combination. \n\nNorman grabbed the coins from his pocket and began to insert them into the coin slot. The digital screen increased with each coin. With one nickel left, Norman inserted the coin with a mild excitement for his morning treat...\n\n*Oh dear,* thought Norman. The last coin hadn't appeared on the digital screen; on top of that, no rejected coins had dropped into the tray below. Confused, Norman pressed the button to eject all of his coins and start over. To his amazement, he only counted 95 cents in total.\n\nNorman looked at the Crunch bar in the vending machine,  then at his measly 95 cents. He thought mentioning the vending machine eating a nickel to the secretary was a bit silly, so Norman opted for a cheaper pack of Juicy Fruit instead.\n\n\"Mmmmm, Juicy Fruit,\" a coworker at a nearby table grunted in a low voice. Norman was confused. \"Y'know, like from that one Jack Nicholson movie!\" The coworker laughed.\n\nNorman didn't know what movie his coworker was referring to, but he smiled and gave a slight chuckle to his coworker as he left the break room.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1662819859.0,"comments":[{"author":"Blu_Phoenix","text":"\"Norman briefly fist-pumped to himself.\" Lol hilarious.

Norman took solace in the fact that Murray Stevens was one of those who opposed the motion.\n\n\nThere were some discontended murmurs from the gallery, but not much was really said. Norman overheard Mr. Strand muttering that politics were, \"all a bunch of crap,\" as he walked out, not even sticking around to hear the rest of the meeting. Norman stayed for the remainder, listening to closing remarks and the motion to adjourn. When all was said and done, councilors and remaining gallery members alike filed out of the chamber.\n\n\nNorman caught the bus outside and thought about the evening's events in quiet contemplation. It had been thrilling to be part of the democratic process, but he couldn't help but feel disappointed that the vote hadn't gone his way. Perhaps, he thought, if he'd spoken up it might have changed some minds. He resolved to make the most of the remaining trash collections before the new scheduling took effect at the start of the next month. He took his time loading his bins, carefully bringing them to the curb the night before, and then pulling them back up the driveway to the side of the shed before he left for work. It was a simple routine, and Norman would miss it.\n\n\nThe new schedule took effect two weeks later, announced a week in advance with another flyer posted to his door. In the end, it wasn't really all that bad. Most of the groceries in his fridge kept just fine for the additional week, and he found that the bins didn't fill up as quickly as he'd feared they might. The garbage truck came every second week, and Norman's life went on as usual- albeit with one small ritual altered.\n\n\nOne evening a few months later, as he pulled into his driveway from work and found a bag of trash scattered across his lawn, he found himself wondering if the democratic process was really all it was cracked up to be.

Norman had been sitting on the bench outside the chambers since 5:30, dressed in the same suit he\u2019d worn to every suit-worthy event for the past 20 years. It fit a little more snugly in the middle than he\u2019d anticipated, having not been worn in quite some time. He\u2019d had a coffee from the stand in the lobby, which admittedly had made him just a little jittery.\n\n\nBy 6:30, he\u2019d been joined by a handful of other local residents. Trash collection was the only item on the agenda that was up for a vote, and everyone who had come out was there for the same reason. Mrs. Haggity was concerned about the smell from her litter boxes if the bagged waste had to sit in a bin for two weeks. Norman hadn\u2019t even considered that. Mr. Strand\u2019s collection schedule was to be shifted to Saturday mornings, which he was worried would interrupt his sleep since he worked nights. And Ms. Davis had been complaining that the reduced schedule wasn\u2019t being applied to all neighborhoods. Norman didn\u2019t add to the conversation, feeling that his remarks would only clutter up the already animated discussion.\n\n\nA slight woman in horn rimmed glasses opened the heavy wooden door to council chambers slightly after half past, and the voting public was led into the gallery seating area. Norman sat towards the back, sitting up straight and watching as the councilors walked in and took a seat at the long, curved table at the front of the room. He recognized Murray Stevens, his local district councilor, from his campaign posters. The council chair banged a gavel and called the meeting to order. Norman listened as they took roll call and certified quorum before reading the items for business, including a discussion of the upcoming park dedication ceremony and the vote on trash collection that had brought Norman and his fellow voters out.\n\n\nThe councilors spoke for about an hour on several of these items for business before opening the floor to the public. One by one, Norman watched and listened as the people he\u2019d been waiting with took to the gallery microphone and spoke their piece about how the proposed changes to trash collection would impact them. Of all the citizens, only two of them spoke out in favor of the reform, citing reduced emissions and the need for better recycling practices as positive changes that might come from it. When the last person sat down, the council called for any further speakers. Norman hesitated, and just before he could stand up, the chair banged his gavel again and the council moved to vote on the trash reform.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1662161465.0,"comments":[{"author":"CatFaerie","text":"I love how Norman's life is so *normal* that he totally skips any and all possible hero moments and goes straight for \"I *almost* did it.\"","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1662178645.0},{"author":"Churchvanpapi","text":"This makes me of think of an episode of Parks and Rec from the pov of a citizen in the crowd during a town hall meeting","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1662198081.0}]},{"title":"Norman the Politician (1\/3)","author":"Dotcor_Strangelove","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/x3uiuh\/norman_the_politician_13\/","text":"The notice of a city council vote came in the form of a flyer posted to his door. He found it when he got home from work on a Thursday afternoon. The local city council had been pushing the issue of reduced trash collection for a couple of years now, touting it as a means to save money during a decline in residential tax revenue and increased costs due to inflation. Currently, trash was collected once per week, early on Tuesday mornings. The proposal was that trash would be collected in the afternoon of every second Wednesday.\n\nThis irked Norman, who had built a routine around Tuesday morning collections. Sunday was for cleaning the house and preparing the trash bags into bins for disposal. Monday evening was for cleaning out any food waste from the fridge and pantry, and for placing the bins by the curb for pickup. Tuesday morning, the bins were ready to go back to the side of the shed before he left for work. It was a simple routine, but it worked.\n\nThis shift to Wednesday afternoon would throw everything off. House cleaning on Sunday would mean garbage piled in bins for 2 days before they could go out. Cleaning the fridge every other Tuesday would throw off his grocery shopping schedule and increase spoilage. And having his trash collected in the afternoon meant that he would need to leave the bins by the curb all day where wind, raccoons, and the occasional teenager threatened to spread it across his lawn.\n\nWhen Norman Jr. called that night, it was all Norman could talk about. He was clearly flustered about the issue, and his son could hardly get a word in edge-wise. \"Dad,\" he interrupted when Norman paused for a breath. \"If you feel that strongly, why don't you go to the council meeting and speak about it?\"\n\nNorman was caught off guard. Attend a council meeting? Disrupt the political process? He was no activist, but it seemed to him that not everything at the bottom had been considered by those at the top.

The \"cotton\/sheet\" cycle lasted 58 minutes and ended with a high-pitched buzzer that he liked to let last for a few moments. 58 minutes, he knew, was exactly the time he needed to prepare his meal, have dinner in front of the evening news, and clear the table. Being able to hang out his laundry between the end of the 8 o'clock news and the start of his Tuesday series was a tried and tested ritual that he would once again manage to accomplish without a hitch. This thought gave him a certain comfort.\n\nNorman cut two slices of his favourite gluten-free bread (not that he was intolerant, but the gourmet frivolity of normal bread was reserved for Saturday), made an omelette and went to get the tupperware of leftover lunch he had taken from the office at 1pm. He always made a little too much food for Tuesday lunch, and knew that the leftovers were for that evening.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, when he took out the tupperware, he was taken aback. Although the shape was consistent with the plastic box he usually used, the colour of the lid was not the usual sky blue but a slightly darker navy blue.

I should have paid more attention at lunchtime.\" He then lost himself for a few moments in his thoughts, lulled by the dull roar of the machine. \"I must have mixed up the tupperware when I left in a hurry, when I was trying to pick up my pace to avoid ending up with David from accounting in the lift, panicked at the idea of having to talk. But if Lisa hasn't picked up my tupperware, then the food will stay at work until tomorrow? That means I'll have to finish my tupperware tomorrow at noon and sacrifice my Wednesday sushi?\" This last idea made him shudder slightly and created a certain fear.

He remembered when Lisa had offered him a red one a while ago that started off cherry flavoured, but gradually faded to cola. It was a little weird, but not actively unpleasant.  \n\nHmm.

He operated the machine like an old pro, ensured that the Meal Deal savings were applied, hesitated, then scanned the Fruit Adventure. *No going back now!* he thought, and tucked it into his bag.  \n\nHe paid and began to walk back to the office, a bit faster than usual with the excitement of his Tesco find.

Norman gasped and corrected his wheel, but the Ford had already zoomed past with a silhouetted middle finger visible in the window.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the rest of the day, Norman was slightly on edge and felt a pit in his stomach.

Then, his eyes met the soft glow of a white sneaker utilizing velcro.\n\n*Ah, now that is something worth considering.*\n\nNorman picked up the optic white velcro sneaker. It was a little too bright for him, but after a few walks around his neighborhood, it would fix the problem. Norman sat at a nearby bench, lifted the velcro flap, and winced. The tearing sound was obnoxious.\n\n*That's a little too loud for me. It's a good idea, though.*\n\nNorman set the shoe back on the shelf where he found it, and he exhaled.

His eyes were wide as he watched the pavers grow wetter in the heavy raindrops. \n\nIt *was* his jacket! It must have slipped from under his arm the previous evening. Oh heavens! He had just laundered it recently and he didn't want it sullied with dirt, pollen or other natural detritus. \n\nHe put his coffee cup down beside the door, and tightened his bathrobe around him. \n\nThen he darted outside. His slippers were no match for the elements and the grass was almost comically slippery. Norman almost slid to the very edge of the pavers and the wet grass soon soaked his slippers. \"Ack!\" he uttered. Cold, heavy raindrops hit the back of his neck and the side of his face and he blinked the wetness away. \n\nJust as he reached down to pick up his jacket he heard a voice from number 4. \"Forget your rain coat, Norman?\"\n\nIt was the owner of the tabby. She was wearing a bright yellow rain jacket, and smiling widely at Norman. What was this woman's name, again? Norman blinked as the rain hit him. \"Um,\" he said.\n\nThe woman's smile grew. \"Or do you just like standing out in the rain in your bathrobe?\"\n\nNorman looked down at his bathrobe, and at the jacket at his feet. A small pool of dirty water was now gathering at the edges of the denim. As he looked down he noticed his bathrobe's belt had come undone during his sliding. He furtively tied up his robe, hoping his neighbour hadn't seen his striped boxers. \"I just forgot my jacket outside,\" Norman stammered, feeling his cheeks burn.\n\n\"I'll leave you to it,\" his neighbour said. \"Have a nice day!\" she called, and then waved and walked from view.\n\nNorman picked up his now-sodden jacket. As he did so his damp bathrobe again came untied and the belt also fell into the dirty puddle below. \n\n\"This is a terrible morning,\" Norman said as he reached down for the belt. Then he scuttled back to the back door and his waiting coffee within. \n\nHe entered his house and shivered. Margot, he thought. That's her name. Margot.\n\nHe felt the smallest smile tug on his lips. He considered his damp robe, his dirty jacket and sodden slippers.

It's awfully light. Did someone wrap up a napkin and send it to me?\"   \n\nNorman racked his brains. He worried briefly that the packet contained anthrax, or drugs, or was part of one of those 'brushing' scams.

The sun seemed to catch the edges of the leaves in a brighter way than yesterday and the colours of the other cars were free of the usual greys and whites and blacks and made him think of his younger days when his mom and pop took him to the theme park at the weekend. He changed the radio to a station that played songs from those times and he smiled and laughed as he remembered ice creams on the way home and that time he won the stuffed monkey at the fair.\n\n\nThe sun was just starting to set, Norman noticed as he turned a corner near the Walmart.

When the wind was just right, he could smell the fresh Mayo filling the jars he remembered watching as a younger man. It was at that moment that Norman felt a familiar excitement. He was going to do something he hadn\u2019t for years and quietly, he began to tremble with excitement. \n\nFreshly packing his lunch, he gazed down at his egg salad sandwich remembering the day\u2019s plan. A devilish smirk found its way on Norman\u2019s face as Norman purred at his perfectly pleated khakis. \n\n\u201cOh yeah\u201d Norman said aloud feeling the cheekiness of teenage summers. \u201cYou only live once.\u201d He exclaimed as he threw in an extra spoonful of relish and finished with not one but two shakes of pepper. The wheels were turning in his head and Norman knew he couldn\u2019t go back now. \n\nNorman straightened the rear view mirror after sitting gingerly into his antique, freshly waxed, pea green 1984 Delta 88, and let the cockles of his heart flutter with excitement. The memories of driving the appropriate speed limit in front of the library as passersby glanced over with admiration for his clear respect for the law while The Beach Boys, at a completely reasonable volume played through his speakers. Norman had to shake out of the daydream as a bead of sweat dropped down his temple. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t long at all before Norman was on the on-ramp and preparing himself for the urban jungle that awaited him. It was just then, he saw the man in front of him continue to drive through the yield without even once slowing to ensure a safe entrance but some folks just want to watch the world burn. \n\n\u201cWhat a dingleberry\u201d said he with a sigh of exasperation. \u201cOh my!\u201d It dawned on him that he shouldn\u2019t use such inappropriate language. He had to remember in that split moment of adrenaline that empathy was the key to conflict resolution. And with that he apologized and hoped the fellow driver had a safe journey. But lo, he was already four or even five cars away by now. There was no way he would\u2019ve been able to see Norman\u2018s mouth word that apology but given his brash reaction, Norman felt obligated. \n\nThat\u2019s when Norman saw it; The exit he had been looking forward to seeing all morning as he felt his heart palpitate in his chest. Then, there it was, the sign he had been eagerly awaiting: \u201cInterstate 1 Truck Stop.\u201d He was finally here. His heart was racing. Nothing had changed. Everything was as it once was; The pebble coated cement trash cans with the dome lids, The black shingles hanging over the men\u2019s  restroom sign. It was all he could do to refrain from smelling the aroma of the urinal cakes. But it was time to do what he came here to do. \n\nNorman walked over to the wooden picnic table with sketches of strangers\u2019 initials and scantly clad women were just sun bleached but visible. \u201cIt really was incredible how far sharpie ink could go.\u201d he thought while dropping the paper bag onto the table. \u201cCome to papa.\u201d Norman said as he pulled out an apple, a caffeine free Coca-Cola classic, and the coup de grace, the egg salad sandwich. The moment was here. And boy, did Norman enjoy his lunch. \n\nNorman wiped the corners of his mouth of Mayo as he got back onto the interstate on his way home. Something about this journey, this rediscovery of youthful recklessness was different. Was it the time that had passed? Had Norman truly grown too much as to lose his love of what once held so thrilling in his life? Was it his friends and the folks he had met along the way? Maybe it was the guilt of living so vicariously without a whim at such a middle age.

And rather nice to see a young person still sporting a brogue. But no, that wasn't important. Not now. Not when this shoe was *untied*.\n\nNorman watched the aglet of David's shoelace bouce back and forth from the floor to the shoe's arch, tap tap tapping its way rhythmically toward disaster as David approached. At any moment, that aglet could find its way under the other shoe, and David would be likely to fall. Something must be done.\n\nLuckily, David was just now approaching appropriate casual acquaintance speaking distance. Norman cleared his throat. \"Excuse me. I'm afraid your shoe is untied.\"\n\nDavid paused and glanced down at his shoe. \"Oh. Thanks, Norman.\" He bent down to tie his laces, and Norman continued to the elevators, pleased that he had helped avert a crisis.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1648497194.0,"comments":[{"author":"crapatthethriftstore","text":"Bonus points for the use of *aglet*","upvotes":24,"created_utc":1648499441.0},{"author":"itsmycandystore_","text":"Wtf is this.

Usually he passed it up because he often felt awkward in social situations and fretted about having some alcohol and then having to drive. But he really was trying to get out of his comfort zone and be a little more social this year. So he decided to drive home first and then get an Uber to take him to the bar. It might be a little more time and money but surely it was less expensive and devastating than getting a DUI or worse, into an accident. He left work at 4:30, knowing it was allowed to leave work a half hour early on Fridays. Then he went to the Uber app on his phone, which he had carefully downloaded and set up with his credit card information the evening before. It was his first time using Uber. Norman set the destination for The Old Stone Pub and Grille and saw Giriraj, a dark-haired middle-aged man with a mustache who drove a silver Toyota Prius, would be there in 10 minutes. He wondered what kind of name \"Giriraj\" was and if it would be rude to ask. He googled the name and discovered that his driver was most likely of Sri Lankan descent. He thought it might be nice to google some information about Sri Lanka, such as the sports they enjoyed there, to have something to talk about with his driver. But what if Giriraj was raised here? Would he find it strange that Norman had googled his ethnicity and things about that ethnicity? What if Norman was wrong and the driver wasn't even Sri Lankan? Norman was lost in these thoughts as the Uber pulled up. Unsure of what to say, he simply said, \"Hi, I'm Norman\" when Giriraj arrived. Luckily Giriraj wasn't much of a talker so Norman played with his phone and mostly looked down until they arrived at pub.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1645908492.0,"comments":[{"author":"yankonapc","text":"I think Norman probably made the right call, but hopefully has had his personal horizons broadened by this encounter.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1646041525.0}]},{"title":"Norman goes to the movies","author":"scsal01","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/t1i1jm\/norman_goes_to_the_movies\/","text":"As the hour approached, Norman thought he should not drink anything as the necessity to go to the restroom would rise in the middle of the movie.\n\nShortly after, Norman decided to take a glass of water. \"This is just a little bit to quench the thirst \", thought Norman.\n\nEnduring the physical pain of not wanting to let his bladder empty til the very end, Norman rushed to the restroom only to find a single urinal available among other men.\n\nNorman quickly pretended his hands were dirty so he could use the faucet.

He was always amazed at how much stuff he could cram into that thing with still room for more!\n\nWhat caught his eye this time, though, was the sale.

Lately he had been picking up the travel booklets at Costco and imagining visiting someplace new. He looked out the window and watched passersby huddle in their coats to protect themselves against the biting January wind. A few lazy snowflakes dusted the street, not enough for the office to close early.   \n\n\nNorman missed the warm weather. He wondered if he might have seasonal affective disorder. He had googled the symptoms: little to no energy, low mood most days during the cold weather, sleeping too much, overeating. *Guilty as charged.* Norman's mind drifted back to the Costco booklet. Palm trees swaying in the Dominican Republic. Sparkling blue water in the Bahamas. A couple enjoying fruit-garnished cocktails in Hawaii. Norman had been very good about saving his money. He had enough that it would be perfectly justified to take a little trip. Just 5 days perhaps but it would be enough. He hadn't taken off time during the holidays other than the days already given to all employees. And after all, he likely had seasonal depression so this was a need. Medical. He tried to focus back on the spreadsheet he was completing but his mind couldn't shake beaches, palm trees, and sunshine. He started to write an email to HR, requesting a week of his saved vacation time to use in February. That would give him enough time to plan his trip, which would certainly brighten his mood.   \n\nThen he stopped mid-sentence. What about Norman? Who would care for his cat? Someone would have to come by everyday to feed him and give him water. He might also need new litter, depending on how long the trip turned out to be. His son couldn't be bothered and although Lisa would likely do it, she was really a dog person, not a cat person. He could ask one of his neighbors. But he felt like he didn't know them well. He didn't really trust them in his house, with his key, using his Internet for who knows what...  \n\n\nNorman felt a little deflated. He would have to figure something out for his buddy Norm. Maybe he would just ask Lisa.  She was a nice person; he didn't take her for the type to steal or use his Internet for some nefarious purpose. She did love animals, even though dogs were the bee's knees to her. (He smiled at the thought of the saying \"the bee's knees,\" a favorite of his.)    \n\n\nBesides, Lisa always seemed to kind of flirt with him.   \n\n\nHe became embarrassed at the thought. Was it flirting? Was she just being nice? Maybe he misinterpreted it. He shook his head. He *did* find her quite becoming and friendly. But isn't it bad to flirt at work these days? He felt like he was never quite sure what was okay and what wasn't at work anymore. He shook his head. He didn't want to dedicate too much time to this whole \"Is Lisa flirting?\" thing.   \n\n\nWhat he wanted to think about was taking a trip to someplace warm. Norman really needed something to look forward to this bleak winter. A vacation would be just the thing. But he didn't want to send that email and ask for the time without being sure he could find someone to care for his cat. The right person to ask really was Lisa, but he didn't want her to feel like he was using her just as a cat-sitter. He would ask her out to lunch and bring it up then. Colleagues have lunch together and it's fine, right?  \n\n\nBut would she think it was a date? Would this be a bad idea? What should he do?   \n\n\nJust then, he spotted Lisa heading over to his desk. Serendipitous? Perhaps but also he really didn't have a plan yet.   \n\n\n\"Hi Norman. I was working on a way to complete materials requisitions more quickly and wanted to pick your brain for ideas. I was wondering...just thinking maybe...a coffee shop? Over lunch break? More comfortable perhaps than here?\"   \n\n\nHe noticed a flush coming into her cheeks that complimented her red hair. He saw a little bead of sweat on her temple as well. This must have been difficult for her to do.  *Maybe she really does flirt with me.*  \n\n\n\"I would be happy to go to a coffee shop with you and would love to talk about your idea. Materials requisitions are a real hassle. I would appreciate a more efficient way to do them. I would really love to talk about the idea you have.\"   \n\n\nDid he say he would love to talk about the idea twice? Ugh, why did he have to be so awkward all the time?  \n\n\nBut Lisa just smiled and looked relieved. \"It's a date then!\"   \n\n\nThey both flushed bright red when she said that. Norman felt uncomfortably warm in his wool sweater and picked at the collar of his shirt underneath.   \n\n\n\"I mean...not a date...but..\" Lisa stumbled over her words and her face got redder than her hair.   \n\n\nNorman giggled uncomfortably. \"Oh, I know. No worries. It's a working lunch.\"   \n\n\nLisa let out a deep breath. \"Well, see you at noon, then!\"   \n\n\nShe hustled back to her desk quickly, likely still a bit bashful about calling their lunch together a date.   \n\n\nNorman fiddled with a pen and thought it might be nice having lunch with Lisa. And he would feel less guilty about asking her to care for Norm.   \n\n\nHe turned back to his spreadsheet and tried to focus on work but a new image had lodged in his mind: Lisa on a beach with him, both of them holding cocktails with fruit. He shook his head again. It was just a working lunch. Even if it did...become more...you don't ask someone on a vacation after one lunch.   \n\n\nAnd then, he would be back to the problem of who would watch his cat.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1641599271.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Normally Norman read page 34 before bed","author":"FlametopFred","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/rvokc0\/normally_norman_read_page_34_before_bed\/","text":"but over the holidays Norman had gotten time at last to read his cherished book and cracked on to page 35 and even the start of page 36","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1641280811.0,"comments":[{"author":"rubberoctopussy","text":"What\u2019s Norman reading?

I\u2019ll check the Arts and Entertainment section of the newspaper and see what interesting things are happening in town.\u201d \n\nIt was Saturday after all and only 8 am. Norman had not even made his coffee yet. Norman still had the paper delivered every morning to his home. While thinking he was adequately tech savvy and certainly enjoying plenty of aspects of the Internet, Norman still loved reading paper. Paperback books, magazines, and his daily paper held a certain nostalgic charm for him even if the Internet was faster and more convenient much of the time. Opening the front door and pulling his robe tighter around him against the cold and rain, Norman grabbed the newspaper from the front porch (safe in the plastic bag but unpleasantly cold and damp all the same). He headed back to the kitchen to start the coffee pot and flip through the paper in search of something fun to do.\n\nAfter firmly deciding he had no interest in the latest superhero flick or any other movies playing at the local cinema and rejecting the idea of spending the day at a church bazaar or fundraising drive, he happened upon something that DID pique his interest: \u201cThe Impressionists: Renoir, Monet, Manet, and Degas\u201d was a traveling exhibit of famous paintings now at his local art museum.\n\n\u201cWe do love art, don\u2019t we, Norm?\u201d \n\nNorm just purred contently.

He'd been telling himself that he was going to read this book for the better part of a year. Four months ago, on a whim, Norman actually ordered the book from some online bookstore\u2014not Amazon, he prided himself for supporting small business\u2014and the resulting good feeling from getting the book a few days later kept him pleased for another two weeks, at which point he actually opened it. For the next two and a half months he followed the strict daily routine of coming home from work, looking at the book on his coffee table, telling himself that he'd read it that evening before bed, and then proceeding to read old Calvin and Hobbes comics instead.\n\nA month ago Norman actually started reading, and to his own surprise, actually enjoying the work. For the next few weeks he would read a few pages at a time, chapter by chapter, piece by piece. Today he finished the last chapter and found himself surprised to have a vague feeling of stress. He put the book down, stood up, and gazed out the window, not really taking in the scene. Norman rubbed against Norman's leg and looked up, hoping for some attention, but Norman lost in thought.\n\nHe realized that, despite having learned that the chief attorney in Brown v. Board of education (he wasn't really sure for which side) was a guy named Thurgood, which was a really funny name, he didn't really remember all that much from the book. There was a whole lot of stuff there about how suburbans started to be a thing, and a lot about civil rights, but he didn't remember many details. This bothered Norman a bit and he wasn't super comfortable about it.\n\nAn police car suddenly raced down the street, bubble gum rack blazing but siren off. Norman craned his neck to see where it was going but it swerved around the corner and disappeared. He stared at the now-empty street for a second before turning to the TV and turning on the news to see what was going on. The weather came on, but within a few minutes there was a story about an armed robbery at the gas station down the street. Norman shook his head. That gas station had always been a hangout for shady kids. Norman jumped up on the couch next to Norman and made himself comfortable, purring softly.\n\n\"You know what, Norm?

Norman was rather excited and looked over to Norman who just as excitedly looked out the window between some plants at the birds playing outside, he too had something to watch this evening. And so, he turned on the television and swapped to channel three where he anticipated a daring criminal drama set in a rural English village, sometimes Norman daydreamed when watching these shows to be the detective\u2019s assistant who occasionally noticed a clue or connection whilst forgetting to pay attention to the show itself.\n\nHe took a bite from a biscuit and looked on as the intro to another show played, but Norman in his eagerness ignored this and continued to watch the show which wasn\u2019t his own.

She did this every other year, and Norman was genuinely looking forward to it, but that didn't mean he wasn't staring at his computer screen and fretting. \n\nNorman loved his nieces, but didn't see them that often. When they were very little Christmas was easy--a teething toy, a nice blanket--just a token of support for his sister, really. But now that they're older, and have interests of their own, picking the right things meant striking a careful balance. He didn't want to get the girls anything messy or loud, as his sister would never forgive him. They had to have presents that were distinct from one another's, and distinct from last year, as the younger one certainly kept stock of what her big sister already had.  \n\n*What on earth do you get three year old and six year old little girls in this day and age?* he shouted internally. \n\nNorman biffed his knee with his face, then stared at the pouch of kitty treats on the edge of his desk. \"No Norm, little girls don't like kitty treats, even salmon-flavoured ones, but thank you.\" \n\nHe didn't want to get them any old plastic tat, or cartoon tie-in products, or things that required batteries or had single-use parts. Even if his sister was okay with TV tie-ins, which she wasn't, he was sure he'd get the wrong show or character. Weren't the girls too old for Peppa Pig now anyway?   \n\nHe knew the littler one liked colouring and the bigger one liked doing hair, and they both liked bugs. *Is there some sort of bug colouring book, or a bug doll with comb-able hair?* He knew he was grasping at straws.  \n\nThen a colour-able doll that promised the included markers would wash out of its hair caught his eye in the Argos catalogue. \"How on earth does that work?\" he mumbled. The promotional photos showed the doll painted by a professional artist--maybe even Photoshopped, he realised--so that was no help. The cat biffed his knee again, and Norman leaned back so he could jump into his lap.    \n\nIn a burst of inspiration he searched for the doll on YouTube, including the term 'washable', and found a video of a man about his age unboxing it and trying it out. Initially embarrassed for both of them, Norman nevertheless watched the entire thing. The man was matter-of-fact about the doll, was fair about how awkward it was for him to use, how much of a mess it made, how the colours looked, and even filmed a bit at the end after he'd rinsed the marker out of the acrylic hair. \"It actually did come out really easily, I was surprised.\" Norman found himself nodding along, also impressed.   \n\nFor the next half-hour Norman watched the YouTuber's toy reviews and occasionally gave Norman treats, no closer to picking out gifts for his nieces but absolutely fascinated.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1639231607.0,"comments":[{"author":"DankScone","text":"Hard to go wrong with a cute stuffed animal for a three year old nibling!

He had meant to do it the week before, but ended up being too busy meeting work deadlines to get around to it. Now, Norman finally had some free time at the end of a grueling Friday night. He rushed upstairs to his bedroom, hurriedly collected the articles of clothing that had begun to overflow his hamper, then deftly carried the mass of fabric back downstairs to the laundry room. As Norman was loading the washer, he observed his mind drawing parallels between his emptying laundry basket and the Java data structures that had consumed his attention for the past five days. He chuckled and remarked to himself that maybe it was time for a well-earned break. Norman then noticed that his laundry had filled the washing machine right up to the top with just enough space for the clothes to slosh around. Satisfied with this development, Norman turned his attention to the two containers of detergent pods sitting on top of the dryer. One container was half-filled with regular sized pods, while the other contained the larger, highly-concentrated ones. Norman pondered for a moment what combination of the two types of pods he should use for optimal bang for his buck. He eventually settled on one large pod and one regular sized pod. Norman closed the lid, feeling content with his reasoning. Since he was having such a pleasant evening, he turned the water level dial to the \"extra large\" setting. After all, it wasn't every day that Norman got the chance to perfectly fill his washing machine with clothes. He confidently pressed the start button on the washer and trotted back up the stairs with slightly more of a spring in his step than usual.

There were brief flashes of CSI scenes from the extended special he watched last evening. It had taken him longer to fall asleep that night.\n\nAt one point while Norman was sifting through his mind, the smell of bakery items aroused his nasal cavities. Norman leaned back in his chair to peak outside his cubicle. Nate and a few other coworkers were gathered around a table on the far wall. Norm first noticed Nate holding a cup of water, but after a few seconds of dazing, he noticed a new girl named Jill take a bite of a muffin. That's when Nate noticed Norman.\n\n\"Hey Norman, why don't you come take a break with us?\", asked Nate after cracking a grin.\n\nNorman's heart skipped a beat. It was only 10:58 A.M., and he had never gone on lunch break before eleven o'clock. \n\n\"Just a moment!\", replied Norman. After a restless two minutes, Norman stood up from his desk, pushed his office chair in all the way, then grabbed his lunch bag and began making his way towards the others. Just as he was about to engage in conversation, another image flashed through his mind. Norman saw his boss' face, and so he remembered that one report which was due by 5:00 P.M. **today**. \n\nAt this point, Norman was already standing right in front of his coworkers, but he couldn't stop thinking of that report. It was an easy essay, and he had left himself with one, maybe two paragraphs to go. Still, the thought of not completing it haunted his thoughts.\n\nJill looked at Norman with a bright-eyed smile. \"Do you like sweets, Norman? Nate brought them in!\" Nate could tell he was a bit out of it, so he reached across the table to scoot the box of muffins towards Norman. \n\nNorman stared blankly at the box for a moment, as if to consider taking a desert before his meal for the sake of his coworkers. Still while staring directly forward, he politely said: \"No thank you\". Then when he turned to direct his voice at his coworker, Nate peeped opened his mouth right before Norman said: \"Maybe later\". Nate closed his mouth for a second, then opened it back up again to say: \"Thats fine, I noticed you were gripping your sandwich bag\". Jill chuckled. Norman looked down to see his hand clenching the paper sack, so he loosened up a little bit so that his grasp did not gather any more attention. Norman's eyes flashed Nate's one last time before they scrolled past Jill and pointed toward an empty table.\n\nAs Norman was walking to his preferred dining spot, behind him he heard a whisper, then that girl chuckled. Norman felt a little insecure. He hadn't thought much of Jill, but he did have a bit of a giddy feeling when her face crossed his mind. She was young, he thought- maybe in her mid 20's, but not particularly gorgeous. There was a mole on her left cheek, but that little twinkle in her eyes outshined the blemishes. \n\nNorman had taken a seat and began eating when Jill walked past his chair. His stomach dropped a little, but he kept his composure as she made her way to the trash can. He only glanced at her before continuing to bite into his food, but he did notice her throwing away a muffin. Then the unthinkable happened: Jill walked right up next to Norman and took a seat.\n\n\"Hi, I'm Jill! I heard your name was Norman?\"\n\n\"I heard your name was Jill\", thought Norman. Norman made a concentrated effort to remember the name of every newly hired individual in his department. He figured if he didn't learn the name as soon as he saw the face, he would never get around to it. There were still a few people in the office whose names he did not know.\n\n\"That is correct\", said Norman. He took a smaller bite this time. Norman thought again about that report which was due, but this time his train of thought was interrupted by the nice young lady sitting next to him.\n\n\"Nice to meet you, Norman! I heard from Nate that you're a really hard worker..\" \n\nNorman's heart sank. He regretted his decision not to finish that report yesterday. He didn't want to stay over-time because he had already planned on watching that one episode of CSI right after work.\n\n\"..wanna show me what you're working on?\"\n\nNorman's eyelids popped wide open. He immediately began packing up his lunch right back into that wrinkled paper sack. \"Actually, now would be a good time to finish that up\", he said in a hurry. Jill took this to mean she was being invited into the life of Norman.\n\nNorman was surprised to see her follow him into his cubicle, but then it occurred to him what exactly she just said. What hadn't yet occurred to Norman is that this new girl was taking a genuine interest in his life. Still, he thought she was just being nice to him.\n\nJill stood behind him as Norman took a seat at his desk. It was 11:15, and Norman had barely scraped into his food. Norman normally ate around noon anyways, so he figured he would save his meal until after he completed his work. However, Norman couldn't concentrate very well while Jill (or any lady) was around him. This didn't annoy Norman as much as he thought it should. Norman was much too concerned about getting his job done.\n\nJill noticed this prominent picture frame standing upright on Norman's desk, pointing slightly away from where they were sitting. Within the frame is a Polaroid picture, and on that picture is a younger, more handsome Norman standing in between two small children. Jill adjusted the picture frame towards Norman, leaned up against his desk then politely said, \"Are they yours?\"\n\nNorman took a moment to answer. Every day he took note of this picture, oftentimes at the beginning of his shift. But Norman hadn't seen that picture at all today, so he stopped to take a look. \"Yes\", he sheepishly replied.\n\nJill let out a big yawn, then outstretched her arms at a slight angle to the ceiling. Just as Norman was about to finish that report, he spotted Lisa out of the corner of his eye. Lisa noticed that she caught Norman's attention, so she felt the need to say hello. Lisa stopped for a second, then buckled one knee. She waved her hand, raised her eyebrows and cracked a smile while quickly saying: \"Hey Norm\".\n\n\"H..hi Lisa!\", gasped Norman. There was a moment of suspenseful silence as Norman couldn't think of what to say. So Norman slowly turned around and began typing on his keyboard. Jill and Lisa glanced at each other, but neither one intended to break the silence. So Lisa nodded at Jill and walked away. \n\nBy the time Norman finished his report, Jill had become dreary. Her posture slouched and her eyes drooped as they were loosely aimed at his monitor. Norman pressed his finger up against the screen, causing a slight color distortion on this flimsy glass facade. Jill stood up and focused on the pointing. \"Look, 10,001 characters!\", Norman excitedly exclaimed. He had just finished this report.\n\n\"Oh, that's a neat coincidence..\" Jill acted surprised for a moment, then gently bounced her shoulder against the wall of the cubicle a few times before asking Norman, \"So what did you make?\" She was giving Norman one last chance to say something interesting. While she had been standing in that cubicle, restlessness had filled the empty sea of boredom, and she could feel her anxiety slowly creeping in. But Norman didn't seem to notice. Norman was perfectly content with the way the world was currently spinning.\n\n\"A status report\", replied Norman.\n\n\"Oh, cool\", said Jill.\n\nJill was disappointed. She was in a light and happy mood when she approached Norman, but now she is out of words to say. In her mind, she convicted him of being the most boring person in the world. Her hyperactive mindset kicked in when she realized she hadn't done much in the last half hour, so she got a little annoyed and told Norman: \"That reminds me- I have work to do too!\"\n\nNorman was well pleased. He felt like he just motivated this 'antsy' young girl to start her assignments, so he generously donated his most thoughtful piece of wisdom to her: \"Well, the hard part is getting started. Once you get going, you won't even think about the work!\"\n\n\"True.. well, bye Norman! Been nice talking to you.\"\n\n\"Bye\".\n\nNorman was alone at last. With all the energy he had from finishing that report, Norman decided to get the rest of the week's work done. On this Thursday afternoon, Norman finished the lunch he had packed. His spaghetti was a little bit below his preferred temperature, but Norman was hungry, so he ate that lukewarm pasta without any complaints in his mind.\n\nWhen 5 o'clock rolled around, Norman felt elated. He would always get chills as he approached his boss' office, but today he was totally confident as be strutted into the room and gently set that report on the desk. His boss was in the bathroom at the time, so with nothing left to do, Norman clocked out, left the building, got in his car and started driving home. \n\nOn his car ride home, Norman seemed to be missing every green light. This didn't bother Norman. But one of those interactions he had earlier began to weigh on him, and he felt a little guilty for not knowing what to say. At one particularly long red light stop, Norman yawned then slipped into a short daydream. He saw flashes of CSI scenes, his boss, the report he had finished, and of course, the girl that he fancied.\n\nNorman finally made it home after a long and busy day. Norman microwaved some leftover pizza, walked over to his couch, then pressed play on his DVR. The CSI theme music started playing. Norman heard all this commotion, so he made his way to Norman to get pet and rest on his lap.\n\n\"I really blew it with her.. I choked bad\", Norman told Norman as he stroked his fur. \"It's ok though\", he said merrily. Norman couldn't stop thinking of the cute way Lisa stopped and said hello.\n\n[Edit: Spelling]","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1638539720.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Norman Meets the New Guy","author":"startrektoheck","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/r7fclx\/norman_meets_the_new_guy\/","text":"Norman's manager made his way around the office with a man that Norman didn't recognize.

He sweated just a bit more than usual and resolved to find an excuse to talk to Marcus at the earliest opportunity. He would mention the upcoming Arsenal match and ask, \"Who do you think will win, *Marcus?*\" He would enunciate the name clearly, so that Marcus would have no doubt that Norman knew very well that his name was not Marc.\n\n\"I must have simply misheard,\" Marcus would surely say to himself afterward.\n\nBut Marcus and the manager spent the rest of the day having what appeared to be a very serious conversation in the conference room with the door closed, so Norman didn't get to speak with him again that day.\n\nAt 5:01 Norman left the office and walked home.

All week long Norman ate a fried egg on toast with an apple or banana on the side for breakfast, but weekends were for pancakes.\n\nEvery Saturday and Sunday morning Norman\u2019s mom had made towers of pancakes. She warmed a casserole pan in the oven and tossed pancakes in there as they finished cooking. \u201cSo they\u2019d stay warm as a hug\u201d as his mother\u2019d always say. Norman was the middle of three boys and always woke up first. He loved spending those early mornings in the kitchen with his mom. She\u2019d make tiny, little pancakes, no bigger than a dime, for her and Norman to snack on while they made breakfast for the family. Mom always said it was important for quality control.\n\nNorman whisked a little water in the pancake mix with a fork and poured the batter into his pan full of hot, frothy butter. The batter made a delightful, gentle sizzle as it met the pan. Bubbles quickly formed along the pancake, the edges firmed and dried, the bubbles slowed and popped, leaving craters along the edge which slowly inched toward the middle. One final bubble popped and the batter didn\u2019t flow in to fill the hole. It was time to flip. \u201cWatch this\u201d Norman said to his cat. He put his right foot in front of left and bent his knee in a lunge, like a fencer ready for battle. Frying pan in hand, Norman made a deft flick of is wrist and a little \u201chup\u201d the pancake sailed through the air making an a hundred and eighty degree rotation before landing perfectly back in the pan.

Norman examined the speaker more closely, and noticed that the cone looked old and didn't even try to move when sound was played through the system.\n\n\"It's all well and good to maintain things and keep them nice, but there is also wisdom in replacing things when it's time\", he said to himself and to Norman. Norman didn't seem very interested, concerning himself more with his water bowl.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nThe next day was Saturday. Norman got up at a reasonable hour, had a leisurely breakfast and a nice cup of coffee before making his way to the store. He checked the temperature before he left, making sure he had a warm jacket and his favourite scarf on. There was a definite chill in the air these days.\n\nHe wasn't settled on getting a new set of speakers right away, but he wanted to see what was available.  Norman appreciated the convenience of being able to order online, but he appreciated the security of a brick and mortar store. He liked talking to the salesperson, and being able to handle the product before making his decision.\n\nHe got to the store and the salesperson started to walk him through the home audio section, pointing out the various features of different sets.\n\n\"Everything seems to be Hi-Fi nowadays, what about regular fi? Regular fi for a regular guy\", Norman thought to himself and chuckled inwardly.\n\nA lot of the speakers seemed either very large and boomy or very small and tinny. One set, however, stuck out to him. He had measured the space under his TV, where it stuck out over his stand. He carefully measured the dimensions of this set before him, and there appeared to be a healthy gap of more than an inch. He asked for a demonstration, and as a movie started to play he closed his eyes and imagined what they would sound like in his living room, without the hubbub of the store behind him.\n\nNorman decided he liked the sound. Crisp but not sharp, clear without tinny, warm but not boomy. He checked the price, and to his delight they were reasonably priced, and even had a 15% sale!\n\nHe had a good interaction with the cashier, but got a little flustered when she commented that he liked his scarf.  He hurried to his car and put the speakers in the trunk.\n\nNorman felt excited at his spontaneity. He was so excited, in fact, that he found himself going 5 over the limit before he checked himself.\n\n\"Come now, Norman. Let's not get too carried away now.\"\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nWhen he was back at home, he went behind his TV and traced the wires from the speakers to the amp,   and unplugged them. He coiled the wires neatly and taped them to the speakers. The new speakers fit exactly where the old ones did, and Norman plugged the ends into his amp. He made sure that the cables were neat behind the TV to make finding things easier next time around. He enjoyed himself immensely playing with the settings on the amp for a while, trying to tune the speakers to sound exactly like they used to.\n\nNorman decided to christen his new speakers with an episode of CSI. During an action scene, he turned the speakers up quite loud and was impressed with how dramatic they made the whole scene sound. He quickly turned them down again, though. He wouldn't want to disturb the neighbours, after all.\n\nNorman, on the other hand, didn't like the speakers to be too loud. He leapt from the couch beside Norman when it got noisy, and ran to the other room. Norman had to coax him back and seemed to be sulky for an hour or two afterwards. This was just one more reason that Norman decided to keep the volume at normal levels.\n\nInwardly he was quite pleased that they were able to go so loud, though.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1635878627.0,"comments":[{"author":"lordperiwinkle","text":"Wow!

It wasn\u2019t as space efficient but Norman hypothesized that the bowls would be much cleaner today.\n\nNorman\u2019s faithful dishwasher had given up the ghost last week after twelve years of stalwart service.

Lauren had never agreed with Norman over the best way to load a dishwasher. She tossed spoons and forks in the silverware basket together some pointing up, some pointing down. Norman always had to fix it when she had loaded the dishwasher so all the spoons and forks were with their own kind and pointing up like proud shiny soldiers.

It was a pleasant surprise realizing that he\u2019d no longer have to hand wash them.

It took several minutes and a lot of gagging, but Norman was finally able to get all of the waste into a trash bag. Feeling accomplished, he dumped out the litter into the same bag. He whistled a song he'd long forgotten the name of as he washed the box with soap and hot water in the sink, wondering if Norman would appreciate his long overdue gesture.

He knew that he should\u2019ve used the bathroom during a break, and that the company wasn\u2019t paying him to pee. With a bit of guilt, he washed his hands and walked back to his cubicle. He passed by Lisa on his way there, who, to his surprise, stopped him with an outstretched foot.\n\n\u201cHey, Norman!\u201d She whispered, furiously scribbling a memo. \u201cI\u2019m really thirsty, but I feel like if I get up, I\u2019ll forget everything I\u2019m writing.

He nodded and hurried over to the cooler.\n\nWhen he arrived, Norman grabbed one of the small plastic cups and poured it full of water. He debated whether he should get one for himself as well, but then he remembered all the un-filed reports on his desk and thought better of it.

The ringing grew louder and louder with each lick.\n\nSuddenly Norman was back in his front room in front of the TV.

Every Friday his accounting firm randomly selects one person to park in the extra front row parking space, and this week Norman was the lucky winner. During his commute, Norman thought about how great his week was going to be.\n\nThe first thing Norman does every day is start a pot of coffee for his co workers. Usually everyone is lined up with their coffee mugs before the machine is done brewing, but Norman hoped that with the time saved by not having to walk all of the way through the parking lot, the coffee will be finished brewing before his co workers get in.\n\nNorman also thought about Lisa walking past his car every day. He quickly grabbed the only clutter in his car (a half drunk water bottle) and quickly stuffed it into the door cup holder. Norman hoped that Lisa wouldn't notice his mess, and would instead notice the brand new tires he spent all Saturday having put on his car. \n\nAs Norman drove into the parking lot and into his spot, he rehearsed all of the great conversations he is going to have about his car. \"Why yes Lisa\" he thought, \"Those are new tires. They are rated for 70,000 miles, with proper maintenance of course.\"\n\nHe got out of his car, walked through the lot, entered the office building, and started up the new pot of coffee. By the time Norman got to his desk, it was 8:55. He smiled, pleased that he was right on time.\n\nTen minutes pass and Lisa walks in. She stopped by Norman's desk to talk to him.\n\n\"Hey Norman, did you see the email? You won the parking spot, you get to park in the front all week!\"\n\nNorman squinted in confusion, and then realized that in all of his excitement, he blew right past his new spot and instead parked in the spot he'd been parking in for the past fifteen years.\n\n\"Oh-\" Norman stuttered. \"I must have forgotten. Haha.\"\n\nLisa smiled and shook her head. \"Norman, you're too much.\" She said while walking to her desk.\n\nNorman quietly giggled throughout the rest of the day.

He didn't have trouble getting out of bed in the morning anyway, not with his furry alarm-clock, Norm, whose claws were an adequate early morning motivator. \n\nThe only issue with decaf is that there weren't too many options besides light, medium and dark, so when he saw a Christmas special\u2014as this was around November\u2014a nutgmeg and ginger flavored coffee, he was given pause. Norm pulled out his wallet, checked how much cash he had on him, recalled the amount in his bank account and savings, and tried to recall the last time he'd treated himself. \n\nAt checkout, watching the bag be swept across the scanner, Norm found himself welling with excitement, so much so that he was more chatty at the register than usual.           \n\"You know if that coffee's any good?\"         \n\"Haven't had it,\" the middle-aged lady cashier said, \"but it sounds good.

The coffee went near his drip coffee maker. Then he carefully folded and stored the paper bags in which his groceries had come, and finally he changed clothes to something more casual, as he'd gone directly from the office to the grocery store.     \n\nNow, it was time. Practically giddy with excitement, and impatient, he took his pair of kitchen shears and, using a ruler, cut a straight line across the bag on the dotted line. Then he disposed of the clipping in the trash receptacle before taking the bag, pinching it on each side, and pulling it open. The aroma of the grounds wafted up and delightfully titillated his olfactory. \n\nNow he poured water in his coffee maker, rinsed out the carafe, set it back on the heating element, then measured out just enough grounds for one 6oz cup, put that into the bamboo filter, put that into the machine, closed it up, and pressed the start button.         \n\nWhen it was done, Norm sat in his favorite chair in the living-room, his cat lying on his feet, and read a book while sipping the coffee, slowly, as to savor it.\n\nIt was pretty good.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1630588928.0,"comments":[{"author":"Slobberinho","text":"I love that Norm uses a ruler to cut a straight line.\nWell done with this story!","upvotes":16,"created_utc":1630595866.0},{"author":"2centsdepartment","text":"Easy there Norman.

The kitty recoiled, slinking away and disappearing behind the hat stand, disgusted by the dripping wetness from Norman's forehead as he bent over to remove his shoes. Was it sweat? Or rain? Nobody knew.\n\nNorman changed into his worn slippers and slumped into his sofa chair, breathing a sigh of relief. *Ahh, yes. It's good I didn't get rid of this chair...it's still quite comfortable, even if it's getting a little raggedy,* he thought. But there was something poking his back, and *that* wasn't so comfortable.\n\nWith a little difficulty, Norman managed to lean forward and reach behind his back. He fished out the remote from the sofa chair and placed it on the armrest before leaning back again, settling back into the chair.\n\nThen he remembered he hadn't washed his hands. *Well,* said Norman to himself. *I don't suppose wetting your hands in the rain really counts.* But then again, would a few germs really kill him?\n\nNorman contemplated this for a moment. His aunt Gretchen would have been appalled at the consideration, of course; *she* would have him wash up before dinner whenever she had him for the summer, in those carefree days when he had been a schoolboy.\n\nBut Norman belonged to a generation of free-range boys that played in sandboxes and climbed trees and ate dirt. Why, wasn't there even that book...that children's book, where the boys ate fried worms? \n\nBetsy was always worried about Tommy, but Norman tended to look the other way when his young son picked food off the table or made use of the five-second rule when they were out for fish and chips. \n\nA little dirt never hurt anyone, and - although Norman wasn't quite sure if there was any scientific basis behind his claim, really -  he felt pretty sure from personal experience that it probably helped boost your immune system, even.\n\nSo Norman finally reached into the brown paper bag for his cheese quesadilla, only to come up empty.\n\nHe peered into the bag. *Cheese quesadilla...quesadillas....they're flat...?*\n\nNorman removed a wad of napkins from the bag, and set them on the armrest. Nope.\n\nNow he was feeling a little impatient. Where could it be?\n\nHe dumped the contents of the bag onto the coffee table in front of him.\n\nNo quesadilla.\n\nWhat?\n\n\"What?\" Norman exclaimed.\n\nNorman jumped, apparently unamused by Norman's declaration of incredulity. Norman was usually quiet (precisely the reason why Norman even tolerated Norman as a roommate), but not today.\n\nNorman hissed and stalked off to find another place to nap, where he *wouldn't* be disturbed.\n\nNorman took no notice of this. He was preoccupied with his own problems, and had begun retracing his steps, up from the chair and back into the entryway...\n\nAs his eyes landed on the stairs, Norman's determined marching stopped and his eagerness and vigor dissipated. Norman was *hungry.* He wanted food, not to go on a treasure hunt for what was probably already a cold cheese quesadilla.\n\nHe went back inside, and found Norman on his chair, curled up and in the middle of a nap. Norman sighed, and turned into the kitchen.\n\nHe looked in the pantry, which unfortunately was mostly empty - Norman forgot to do his shopping again - and reached in the back to see if there was anything left. \n\nNope.\n\nNorman made an effort to push the drawer in before shutting the cabinet doors, but to no avail. There seemed to be something in the way, something behind the drawer which prevented it from going in all the way.\n\nNorman reached again, and extracted a slightly can of chili \"con carne\" from the pantry.\n\n\"Well, not expired,\" Norman said, peering at the small text on the label.\n\nHe'd read somewhere that dented cans were no good, but he supposed the dent was from trying to push in the drawer. Maybe.\n\nThis can was one of those ones which had the tabs you could pull, for easier opening. Unfortunately for Norman, he'd snapped it off on his first try, and consequently needed to make use of a can opener.\n\nWith a little frustration, Norman was able to find a microwave-safe bowl, which he dumped the contents of the can into, before placing it in the microwave.\n\nAs the bowl of chili spun in the microwave, Norman stared absentmindedly out the window. *Chili was Mexican, wasn't it? Or was it Texan? Both, perhaps?*\n\nHe noticed a small speck of white on the road he had crossed, and wondered for a second if he had seen an even tinier speak of magenta on it, if it was the wrapper to his quesadilla, if he had somehow dropped it...no, Norman was careful...it couldn't be, could it...but his thoughts were interrupted by the beeping of the microwave.\n\nWhen Norman had his bowl of chili and turned back to look out the window, a large Amazon van passed by, splashing mud onto the pavement, subsequently displacing all of the litter and making it intelligible.\n\nNorman sighed, shrugging, and made his way back out to the living room, where he would shoo Norman from his chair and proceed to, *finally*, have his Mexican(?) dinner.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1629991403.0,"comments":[{"author":"shia_labeouf0","text":"Norman really had quite the day!","upvotes":8,"created_utc":1630005727.0},{"author":"Din_Kinomoto","text":"Poor Norman, he just wanted a nap :(","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1630057564.0},{"author":"goper2","text":"Now I want a quesadilla.., but so should I?","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1635567537.0}]},{"title":"Norman visits a Mexican restaurant","author":"strawberry-dacquoise","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/pbnngc\/norman_visits_a_mexican_restaurant\/","text":"EDIT: This is part 1. Read part 2 [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/pc1pcz\/norman_eats_mexican_food\/).\n\nNorman wasn't one for eating out.\n\nIt wasn't that he couldn't afford it, no; not *really*; he *could* if he wanted to, at least occasionally.\n\nWhen he was married to Betsy they had dinner at the local, all-american diner every Friday night. Out the door by six and back home again by eight, just in time to put Tommy to bed. She always had breakfast for dinner, and he always had the pork chop special. It was kind of rubbery, and smelled faintly of wet socks, but he didn't mind back then, even when it reminded him of the mystery meat he had during his schooldays. The mashed potatoes were fluffy, and the string beans were good, although they were most definitely canned.\n\nAt first they'd go to the drive-in movies after - his wife always insisted - but they stopped some years into their marriage. Then Betsy was gone, and Tommy grew up and left him too.\n\n*Those were the days*, Norman thought to himself. Not really because he liked being a family man, although he wasn't particularly opposed, either. It was a lot easier going when he had hair, in general. And a kid. And a wife, even one that wasn't particularly fond of him. *Man, it'd be nice just to be young again*, Norman concluded. After all, a young man eating out alone (before presumably going home to his family) is less sad-looking than a balding, middle-aged man doing the same thing.\n\nMaybe if he'd made an effort a few years ago to find someone new....\n\nBah. The trouble with women was he didn't really know what to do with them, once they were past being interested in him.\n\nNo matter. He'd go out tonight, and eat alone. Yes.\n\n*I'll even try someplace new!* Norman exclaimed to Norman, feeling adventurous all of a sudden. Norman licked his paws with disinterest as Norman scritched his ears absentmindedly, contemplating.\n\nAt this moment Norman's Blackberry began to buzz.\n\n\"Hello?\" he said.\n\n\"This is an important message about your car's extended warranty...\"\n\nNorman hung up, suddenly feeling very tired.\n\n\"Well, time for dinner, I suppose,\" he remarked. He ought to leave the house before he changed his mind.\n\nNorman extracted Norman from his lap, put on his coat, and headed out the door.\n\nIt was raining, but only slightly.\n\nIn the foggy haze, the bright, neon sign of Taco Bell glowered softly, beckoning at him.\n\n\"It's just across the street,\" Norman muttered. *Yes, that wouldn't be too far. Why, I dont think I've ever had Mexican before.*\n\nNorman crossed the street, and had a little trouble opening the doors. One of the people sweeping looked at him oddly and motioned at the other door. After a little bit of fumbling, Norman realised he had been opening the wrong door, and incorrectly at that. He pushed instead of pulling, and nearly fell in, catching himself just before. He smiled sheepishly, but the worker had moved on to cleaning another table and took no notice of this.\n\nNorman wiped his brow and pushed his glasses up his nose. \"Cheese quesadilla...hmm...\"\n\n\"Hello,\" said Norman.\n\nThe cashier stared at him.\n\n\"I'll have the, uh, cheese quesadilla, please.\" Norman felt proud of himself for pronouncing it correctly.

Next!\" she said.\n\nNorman stepped backwards, such that he could view the TV screen with the order numbers on it, and was glad that she didn't ask him any difficult questions such as which sauces he might have wanted or whether or not he would like a meal. He didn't suppose meals were like they were at McDonald's or Burger King...were they? Fries and soda didn't seem too Mexican to him. But then again, he wasn't exactly a food connoisseur, or even a fast food enthusaiast. So he wouldn't know.\n\nNorman picked up his order when it was finished and made his way back across the street to his apartment, where he would have his dinner in his comfy sofa chair right in front of the TV, satisfied with his little expedition.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1629935644.0,"comments":[{"author":"TheLostSkellyton","text":"I love everything about this story.

He looked down. It was Norman, his cat. After brushing himself around his ankles, Norman sat down and expectantly stared up at Norman, who had only slowed his slurping of the slightly-too-hot porridge. It appeared that Norman also wanted a taste of oats.\n\n\"You don't eat oatmeal,\" Norman said to his cat after a few moments. \"Cats eat cat food, not oatmeal.\" The cat did not react and continued to stare. A short while later, Norman went back to eating his breakfast, but Norman still kept his eyes on the coveted bowl of oatmeal on the table. \"Weird,\" Norman said, shaking his head.\n\nIt was then that the sound of the cat flap clicked once again in the quiet morning kitchen. Norman swallowed a spoonful of oats and turned. He was greeted with a surprise. There was now a second cat sitting at his feet, gazing longingly at Norman's meal. Both cats were identical, and both could pass as Norman.\n\n\"Did you bring a friend, Norman?\" Norman asked both cats, unsure which Norman was the authentic Norman. He couldn't afford two cats, he considered. Which one was actually his? Maybe this one was the neighbor's cat? He continued eating and didn't move. It was too early for excitement. He was sure the situation would fix itself; he didn't want to deal with any new hassles today.\n\nNear the end of his meal, he saw one of the Normans turn around and walk out through the cat flap, and one Norman remained, still sitting primly at his feet. This was the true Norman, he decided, petting him on his head. The cat purred. Norman took this as a sign from the universe that he was correct in his deductions, and continued on the rest of his day in wry contentment that all was as it should be in the world.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1629069862.0,"comments":[{"author":"FusiformFiddle","text":"Norman, are you experiencing a glitch in the Matrix?","upvotes":10,"created_utc":1629117624.0}]},{"title":"Norman has nothing to do on sunday","author":"Clivern","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/p4w18x\/norman_has_nothing_to_do_on_sunday\/","text":"he lay on the couch doing nothing","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1629042875.0,"comments":[{"author":"FlametopFred","text":"Normally Norman naps on Sunday to stave off existential dread.

It was originally-- \n\n\u201cHello (business owner's name, or 'hardworking team-member of (said business)'). My name is (your name), I'm an account executive with the digital securities company DigiBuff. How are you today? (Talk about their day if they are open to it.) I hope that I'm not reaching you at a bad time. I would just like to ask you a few questions about your current security provider. Do you feel secure with YOUR security?\u201d \n\nAt the request of his new manager, Norman had crossed out \u201caccount executive\u201d and wrote above it, \u201cdigisec expert\u201d. He also crossed out \u201cdigital securities company\u201d and wrote above it, \u201cdigisec startup\u201d. \n\n\u201cThe company, they want to go with new verbiage,\u201d explained the man twenty years Norman's junior. \u201cRight,\u201d Norman softly replied, \u201cbut isn't it disingenuous to call ourselves a 'startup'?\u201d \n\nNorman's new manager asked, \u201cHow do you mean?\u201d \n\nNorman neglected to answer honestly in the moment, opting instead to say, \u201cOh, nothing...\u201d Walking back to his cubicle. Thinking, ***How*** *do I mean? I mean this company's as old as you are...* \n\nSitting down, looking at the first box in the flowchart. \n\n*I mean 'digisec experts' have been saying this line since Shakespearean times, and you just now got around to editing it?* \n\n**HOW** did they neglect to make it shorter OR easier to say!?\n\nHow were people making sales with this? He surveyed the other digisec experts in the cube farm. He listened as they called and delivered the first line. They might get hung up on here or there, but otherwise they were getting all the way through it. It didn't matter if they sounded like they were actively chewing on tobacco, it didn't matter if they were sinus-infected and intermittently snorting blood into their throats, it didn't matter how many 'uhm's or 'motherfuckin's they peppered in. These \u201cadults\u201d were making sales to *adults*.\n\nIt wasn't imaginary. Norman could see the same charts that everyone else could\u2014other experts could make the script work. The first line can work, he just wasn't doing it right. \n\nHe put on his headset and remembered his first day of training. Breakfast was bagels, then after breakfast they explained the importance of smiling. Norman stretched the corners  of his mouth as far as they could go. Then, lunch, he couldn't remember what they'd gotten for lunch, but he did remember that afterwards they were told, 'if you're having confidence issues, try standing up during your call'. \n\nHe stood up, his eyes and the top of his balding head peeked just above his cubicle walls. He was smiling so very widely. He felt he looked too much like a nutcracker, so he slouched his shoulders. He hit the spacebar to dial the next number on his spreadsheet. \n\nThis was one of those with a weird ringtone, the software did this sometimes. Long, bass-y, digitally distorted rings relentlessly rang into Norman's ears, all as he maintained his power stance and his game face. \n\nAn old man answered the phone at Paulie's Discount Television. \u201cHi,\u201d Norman said through his chest with all the conviction he could muster, feeling like a barbarian, \u201cPaulie. My name is Norman. I'm an a--, a-hem, excuse me, I'm a digisec expert with the digisec startup Digibuff. How are you today?\u201d \n\nThe flowchart warned that, at this point, the prospect might actually be open to talking about their day. To Norman's horror, he was wide open. He explained that Paulie had died mere weeks ago. Today he was figuring out how things work in Paulie's absence, and so he pleaded to Norman, \u201cWhat company did you say? Digibuff? Are you the people we use for our alarms?\u201d \n\nTalk about a curveball. Norman wasn't all the way through the first line yet. Already this guy's asking questions, a man has died, and, truthfully, Norman didn't know if Digibuff offered alarms. \n\n\u201cI don't know,\u201d answered Norman. \n\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d answered the desperate old man, and Norman's posture crumpled. He said, \u201cI'm sorry.\u201d There was a long pause. Norman heard a sniffle on the other line as the obviously frayed old man tried to compose himself. The man asked, \u201cWho're you again?\u201d \n\nNorman's shoulders perked back up. \n\n\u201cHi Paulie. My name is Norman. I'm a digisec expert with the digisec startup Digibuff. H--,\u201d he almost made the mistake of asking how the man was again, but he caught himself, \u201c--hhope that I'm not reaching you at a bad ti--,\u201d oh, Jesus, he thought. Then he said \u201cI'm sorry...\u201d He felt so heavy. \n\nAfter a while, Norman heard the man ask, \u201cSon, who the hell are you?\u201d \n\n\u201c... I would just like to ask you a few questions about your security provider. Do you feel secure with YOUR security?\u201d Norman made sure to point his finger in front of him when he said 'YOUR', to really sell it. \n\n\u201cMy security provider? What are you talking about? You mean alarms?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo sir\u2014well, I don't know, really we're more of a merchant services company,\u201d \n\n\u201cWHAT DO YOU DO!?\u201d \n\n\u201cCredit card processing...\u201d \n\n\u201c...

It felt terrible, too. He'd been laying on his couch so long that his back had already begun to hurt, and now he was getting chest pains. These were the same pains that his doctor explained were anxiety-induced, and Norman could tell, because after that appointment he'd gone directly home and googled the difference. \n\nA real heart attack is a crushing pain.\n\n\"...\"\n\nThis was a more of like, if he'd have put words to it, a splitting pain. \n\n*Good Lord, she's really laying it on thick*, thought Norman as he locked his eyes to the dots. Then came the sad 'ploot' of an inbound text. Norman could swear he felt his heart jump and sink at the same time. \n\n\u201cAnd I don't want to make you feel bad,\u201d read the fresh bubble, and Norman instantly felt worse. It continued, \u201cbut maybe you shouldn't feel great? I'm 45. Getting stood up when you're 45 feels ludicrous. Having your time wasted when you're 45, you know, it'd be dramatic to call it devastating, but it's definitely bullshit...\u201d \n\nThe bubble continued, but Norman hadn't read it yet. He'd menued over to the privacy settings on this contact, and set it to 'do not disturb'. Then he dropped his phone on the floor. \n\nHe let his cat lay down on him for a while.\n\nHe walked around his apartment. \n\nIt was nighttime now. It was evening then, and it's nighttime now. Norman wasn't used to having such a busy mind that he couldn't get to bed on time, even on a Friday. He had dedicated several hours worth of brainpower towards generating one nightmare scenario. \n\nThe nightmare was predicated on the fact that no matter how late he stayed up, even until 11:00pm, he always woke up at 6:00am. That meant he'd have to set an alarm, which meant he had to grab his phone, which meant he wouldn't be able to stop himself from looking at his text log. He'd have to see how many texts his smartphone had kept a secret from him, sparing him from what must have been hours and hours worth of 'ploot's. \n\nThen the real nightmare was, of course, the number. What would the number be? How many texts? How many variations of \"you're a worm\" could there possibly be? Norman imagined 5 and felt ill, until he realized, *my god, it goes so much higher.* \n\nFinally, Norman's living room wall clock read 11:25 pm. In-between his nods into unconsciousness, he wondered, why had he gotten rid of his nightstand alarm clock, but not his living room clock? The nightstand alarm clock could've gotten him out of this entire mess, the living room clock is functionally worthless. \n\nHe relented. He grabbed his phone off of the floor and slumped off to bed. \n\nIt wasn't until he'd set his alarm app that he felt the itch. The horrible, clawing, bastard of a thing that pulls your eyes towards the truth. He choked back a bilious splash of reflux and thumped his thumb onto the message app. \n\nThe nightmare, the number, was now a reality, and it was zero. She'd said everything she'd had to say in the text from earlier, the one that Norman couldn't finish reading. Was this a worse outcome? Norman couldn't decide, but he also couldn't control himself, and so the bubble showed up again. He just stared at it blankly for a while, his brain refused to arrange it's contents into sentences. He felt a pain in a chest that made his eyes focus, and then there it was, the rest of it. \n\n\u201cBut you've stood me up twice now, and I'm not angry. After getting to know you on the phone, it's just disappointing. I can't get mad that you're wasting my time because I know you're not doing anything better with yours! You're just putzing around! You're not even building model trains or whatever you're into, you're just vegetating. If you ARE having fun, then I apologize for assuming, but you need to apologize too! But I assume you're not having fun. So I'd like an apology, I guess, but I don't need one. Just don't ever ask me out again if you aren't serious, and please take care of yourself.\u201d \n\nThat was it. Norman couldn't believe he got through all of it. Had he remembered all of it? No, he decided that he didn't remember all of it, but he was going to wait to re-read it. That way he could remember what it said. \n\nWas it bad? \n\nHis eyelids drooped. \n\nThey darted back open to make sure his alarm app was set. \n\nHe didn't feel bad. He didn't feel anything except, you know, 'In bed'. \n\nHis eyelids drooped. \n\nIt was the greatest feeling in the world.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1626403478.0,"comments":[{"author":"PhoenixInfinity88","text":"I wonder why Norman was so anxious about meeting her?","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1626408502.0},{"author":"t0pd0g420","text":"Lol","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1626660260.0},{"author":"Plasu","text":"So he stood her up because he forgot?

He liked the bigger numbers, at least. Sales could double his earning power in a year, without a degree or a certification, or another loan from another family member. He could be promoted from within, and why not? He put in the time! He could go from an Administrative Manager, all the way to an Account Executive...\n\nBefore considering sales, when Norman felt firmly settled into his $40k\/year role as an Administrative Manager, he never felt the terrible pang of excitement that you get from looking at *things*. \n\nWonder, admiration, seething envy, none of it ever effected his impulses. Grills under poolside cabanas under RV awnings, Norman had the ability to see it, not store any information about it in his brain, and then walk away from it as though it didn't exist. He'd forgotten every Roomba that he'd ever met. \n\n\u201cIt'd only be two weeks worth of training, and then,\u201d he'd start to think... \u201cAnd then...\u201d A switch would flip and Norman's mind would turn to his ultimate shame, his shadow.

He hears them humming in the distance. He knows they might be $90 a pop, but who gives a hoot!? It's sales, you're wheelin' and dealin'! If he closed a deal, he could buy 10 decent Lasko fans, gray, like they used to make 'em. Then who cares if he's not hooked up to the central AC in his apartment building, just because he lives in the basement? Utilities are included, so if he hooks up ten fans? Then his landlord's the sucker. Then Norman's on top! \n\nThe thought of TWO shifts in status in one day is enough to make him feel queasy, and then his thoughts would start to race.\n\nHe still liked the bigger numbers, that he'd be able to double his income in a year without a what'cha'ma call it. But he'd come to the conclusion that sales is impossible. *Ring ring*, Norman would roleplay with himself in his head. \u201cHello?

Jerry had been in sales for fifty years, and he was the coolest guy Norman had ever known. Really made everyone feel included. Remembers everyone's birthdays. Jerry had been fired a month ago, and since then, Norman didn't have anyone to mentor him from afar. Everyone besides Jerry who Norman would listen to, making their cold calls through the cubicle, they just weren't the same. They were kids. Cracking voices, unsure of themselves.\n\nThey sucked, but Norman would listen back to the practice voice in his head and, he had to admit, it was identical. \n\nHell, he could never even *live*, much less practice long enough to get better than Jerry. And Jerry was fired! Why was he fired? Politics? Age? Norman hoped it was about age, but only because he was three firings away from being considered \"the old guy.\" This gave him a sense of stability that he'd never felt at this job. \n\nNorman doesn't think about sales much anymore.

This was a lot to take in and he didn't want to make a mistake with the women on the site.  He looked over at Norman and asked the cat what he recommended while petting him.  The cat meowed back a content reply and Norman agreed that it might be good to catch up with friends before rushing into anything.  He opened up his friends list and saw that Tom was still a friend.  \n  \n*Dear Tom,*  \n*How are you doing?  I'm sorry for not catching up with you over the years.

Though tonight would be different, and he was excited.\n\n\"Norman, where's your oven mitts?\" asked Ernestine, somehow still in a hurried state.\n\n\"Didn't you just ask that?\" Norman went to point to above the stove, but the mitts were gone now. \n\n\"I don't know Norman. This is a busy kitchen, lots of moving parts.\" Norman was glad to have Ernestine around. She was the best of friend that a middle-aged man like himself could've asked for, and while she could be difficult about things like oven mitts and how Norman dresses, but he loves her and she loves him so he can't complain all too much. \n\nJust then, a knock on the door- the first of the guests have arrived. Norman untied his watermelon apron and hung it on the coat rack, fixing his hairs a little more before answering the door.\n\nIt was Junior and Gracie, hailing pie. \n\n\"Heyo! Glad you could make it!\" Norman gave them a generous, simultaneous hug, slightly crushing the pie in between. Gracie said a welcome hello to Ernestine, catching up since their first meeting at the wedding months earlier. Junior blushed, just noticing that Norman's entire foyer was filled with framed photographs of Junior's photography. \n\n\"How the hell did you get all these photos, dad?\"\n\n\"I've been mailing it to him,\" added Gracie. Norman grinned, giving Gracie a well earned hug. \"and in return I've been sending her your baby photos. Remember the road trip of 2005?\" \n\n\"I was twelve years old back then.\"\n\n\"Yeah, still just a baby to me.\" \n\nJunior wandered around the apartment, taking in the sights new and old, though he did inevitably notice one large missing presence- the cat. Norman chimed in, slight hesitation with how Junior might react to the news.\n\n\"Ah! Well actually, bad news... The cat's not here in the apartment for the next week. He's staying with Marcel, a young man across the street.\" Norman decided to tell the Cortez family that he would be out of town for Christmas, and could use a babysitter for the week. Norman wished that the cat could be here for Christmas too, but he thought of what it would be like to be in the kids shoes. Knowing that he was helping give that kid one Christmas like the one he's had with the cat for the last number of years felt worth it. Plus, it helped that Norman didn't feel alone at the moment.\n\n\"Ah, well, that's really kind of you dad. I'm sure the kid appreciates it. I was around the same age when we got Norman too, eh? Feels like a lifetime ago.\"\n\n\"That it has been.\" There was another knock at the door, though this time Ernestine answered it.\n\n\"Norman!\" she shouted, \"It's your ex-wife!\" Norman blushed and laughed it off, heading over to greet Suzanne and Jeff, stepping through the front door. He was nervous, sure, but he knew he had no reason to be. Exchanging pleasantries and thoughts on the road over, Jeff handed Norman a wrapped present, only to be opened on Christmas morning. \n\n\"I like what you did with the place, Norm.\" said Suzanne, taking a look at the place she helped find almost a decade before. \"It's similar, but you made it your own.\" Suzanne noticed the recliner in the corner of the room, facing the window, cat toys scattered across it.\n\n\"Is that the same chair my dad gave you as a wedding gift?\" asked Suzanne. \n\n\"Uh, yes, I suppose it is. It's become the cats chair as of late, and I can't really pinpoint why.\" There was a reason why, and the loveseat still holding the center stage in the living room answered the question even if Norman did not. \n\nJust then, someone walked in the front door, after a few obligatory knocks. It was Frank. He looked a little small himself, slightly embarrassed to be knocking on Norman's door, but the pie he was holding made it clear he was here with good intentions.\n\n\"Frank!\" exclaimed Norman, \"Glad to see you! Come on in!\" \n\nFrank stepped in the door, kicking off the slippers he wore to get from his apartment to Norman's.\n\n\"Hey everyone, this is Frank, my neighbor and cubicle mate.\" Everyone collectively said hello.\n\nNorman gave Frank a small tour of the apartment, showing the vital locations for a guest, namely where the bathroom was and which shelf had the beer. \"Hey Norman,\" started Frank, \"Just like to say... Thanks. I don't, you know, ask people for things. But it's been hard without Josie and... Yeah. I'm just being a baby. But thanks for inviting me.\" \n\n\"You're not a baby, Frank, that's just how you're feeling. It's good to get things off your chest, and tell people how you feel. Believe me. And hey, maybe things will work out in the end.\" Norman gestured to Suzanne, standing and talking to Junior by the window. \n\n\"They might be different, but that's okay.\" Norman smiled, walking over and giving Frank a hug, and Frank accepted.\n\nJust then, Ernestine called for Norman to the kitchen for help with pulling out the turkey.\n\n\"It's heavy!\" exhaled Ernestine, putting in a small mimed effort to make it look like she at least tried to pull out the turkey before calling for help.\n\n\"Where's the oven mitts?\" asked Norman.\n\n\"Oh God.\" said Ernestine. \n\nPanic ensued. As the turkey sat in the oven, getting dryer and dryer by the second, the chaos of searching for the oven mitts spread to involve everyone in the party, getting on their hands and knees, hunting for it before it was too late. Junior tried to reason with Norman that a towel could do the trick. Ernestine shouted, trying to give orders by standing on top of a chair an pointing wildly. Frank found Norman's missing wallet, one he lost years ago and was forced to cancel all his cards and get a new one. Frank, not knowing it was the missing one, put it back where he found it. Smoke started to rise to the ceiling, and then there was a knock at the door.\n\nThe person let themselves in, right as Norman was reaching for the doorknob.\n\n\"Hey Norm',\" said Francine. \n\nAfter the startled excitement to see Francine in the midst of the chaos, Norman noticed she was wearing rather thick, oven-mitt-like mittens. \n\nAfter she apologized for being late (though made up for it by saving the turkey), the gang all gathered round the table, using what benches, chairs and stools Norman had in his apartment, and sat down, passing plates and plating turkey.\n\nNorman and Francine sat beside each other, and it took a few moments before the two properly spoke a word to each other. Norman could feel that tension, that moment awaiting to happen, if only he could just reach out and say it.\n\n\"Hey Francine...\" started Norman, Francine listening intently. \"It's nice to see you again. Really.\"\n\n\"It's good to see you to Norm'. You look well!\"\n\nNorman smiled, nodding.\n\n\"You have a good family going here, my mom included.\"\n\n\"Yeah! It's been a long ride getting here- maybe a little too long to reach this moment in my life. But in the end, I'm happy.\"\n\nFrancine smiled, grabbing Norman's hand from under the table and squeezing it, and he squeezed back.\n\n\"Hey and Francine... I'd just want to tell you I'm sorry. And if you would like, if I may ask, I'm dancing around the words but... I'd like to try and give it another go. If you're up for it still. No pressure.\"\n\nFrancine paused, giving it a thought.\n\nShe took her napkin off her lap, leaned forward, and gave Norman a kiss, a quick one that snapped like lighting, the thunder coming through as Junior, shocked, watched his father partake in something romantic. Gracie blushed along with Norman too. \n\nNorman held onto Francine's hand for the rest of the dinner after that. Suzanne and Jeff escaped into their own bubble too, talking and goofing around with each other like teenagers, and the teenagers at the party, Gracie and Junior, whispered to each other about Norman like proud parents themselves. Ernestine and Frank were hitting it off surprisingly well, with Frank's talks about politics working well with how talented of a bullshitter Ernestine was. A few blocks away, Norman the cat cuddled with Marcel Cortez, the boy who internally was telling himself he'd die for this cat, and couldn't imagine loving anything more than this cat, despite just being the babysitter. \n\nIt was a beautiful evening for Norman, a special one for sure. This last year for Norman had been one of many changes, and looking back now, he can see it for what it was- a chapter in his life, one of great change, challenge, and excitement. He was glad for his chances to love, to be loved, and he was glad he took the time to be sad, just so he could understand why it would all be worth fighting for. Norman saw this party as the closing of this chapter, and he was happy to greet any changes that the next chapter in his life would bring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The End","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1625663914.0,"comments":[{"author":"MattressCrane","text":"So it's finally over!\n\nI'm sorry it's been such a long ride to get this finished. It's been a plot for me that's been kicking around in my head since... Well, since before the book of norman was finished, back in 2017. I always had this chronology in my head of what Norman's life is like, how he reached the place in his life that his character is. And I guess I was just always a little sad that we reach peak Norman, though he never learned to grow from his mistakes. I guess this series was all a response to that; how to I not change Norman, but still tell a story that brings closure to all the plots around him.\n\nThis was a very personal project for me, a bit of me in every arc, a bit of me trying to solve my own problems through Norman. It's been that way for years; Norman always being a surrogate to how I'm feeling, and sometimes I just need to say it bluntly, and work it through writing. I first came across Norman back in 2014, and I was immediately grabbed by it; I just liked the style of writing, and just the overall idea of a subreddit that continues a single character's story for years. I've become quite entangled with Norman's life ever since; now I sort of run the subreddit, made the book, deal with all the mod-mail... And I think, just like Norman in this, it's the end of a chapter in my life. It's been thick and thin throughout the years, but I think it's time I retire from the subreddit.\n\nIt's an odd feeling, even writing this letter- I don't think anyone's gonna read it haha. This series hasn't been a big crowd pleaser over the year, and I get it, periodically releasing a 57 part online novella isn't the cleanest way to release a story like this. But it's never really been about having people read it, moreso it's about just having it exist, committing myself to the project to the very end, and being able to walk away and tell myself, yeah, I wrote the Norman tale I wanted to tell. I know how reddit works, that this post will have a couple hours to make an impression before sinking into the archives, but I just want to say thanks to anyone who's read this whole series. I'm taking a bit of an irish exit with it, but just know that I appreciate you being here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBye everybody.

To his right, Ernestine, which came to no surprise for him, and he was glad to be sitting beside someone he could share hot gossip with, if needed. Seated to his left, Suzanne Stevenson. That was *Jeff's* last name. He supposed he shouldn't be surprised that he would be sitting beside her, but it still came as a shock, something that made his nervousness stronger than the feelings of happiness he was having for his son.\n\nSoon enough the crowd filled, Norman shook hands and nodded to Suzanne as she took the seat beside him, shoulders rubbing. The rest of the show went on without a hitch- no objections, thankfully- and Juniors friend gave an artistic interpretation of a priest, dressed in a violent red robe with a crucifix tied to the back of his head. It went surprisingly respectfully.  Norman's head escaped into it's own place once again as the priest spoke about \"til' death do you part\", momentarily holding his breath. Maybe Suzanne felt the same way, watching this proposal and being lost in the time they did the same.\n\nThough it was greatly different back then. The reason they got married was because Suzanne was pregnant, and though social pressures weighed in on the decision, the decision was mainly made for what the two of them thought would be best for the kid. In hindsight now, Norman knows Suzanne's enthusiasm never did line up with his. She was always unsure, always imaging what her foot would look like if it was just slightly out the door. At the time, Norman was naive, and didn't think to listen to his wife to see how she was feeling. He should've spoken up more in those times, though even if he did say something, nothing would've helped Suzanne not feel like she's lost a large part of her life not being herself. He didn't know what he should've done, even now.\n\n\"I do,\" said Junior.\n\n\"And do you, Gracie Gordan, take this man to be your husband?\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Gracie.\n\n\"Well then that's it. You guys are married. You may now kiss your groom.\"\n\nGracie and Junior embraced each other, giving a perfectly theatrical kiss while also keeping it personally romantic. The crowd roared, some preemptively throwing rice, others throwing the seat cushions into the air, downing drinks the best they could. It was clear- the legally traditional ceremony was over, and the party had now begun.\n\nThe crowd worked their way to the garden area, a cobblestone terrace looking out at a small man made lake. Early songs started out with a small number of outliers running into the center, dancing to their hearts content, and as the night went on, the drinks left in the bar dwindled to the single digits, hardly a person left to the dancing sidelines.\n\nExcept for Norman. Norman wasn't one to dance, though he could never tell if it was the fear of being judged, or if it was that he honestly did not know how.\n\n\"Norman!\" screamed Ernestine, emerging in a stupor from the dancing crowd, as if she was reincarnated as a drunk teen. \"What're doing?\"\n\n\"Oh I'm just, y'know, looking for chance to get into the song. I'll see if I recognize the next one.\"\n\n\"No no no.\" said Ernestine, grabbing Norman's hand. \"I don't know this song. You don't know this song. We'll figure this one out together.\"\n\nAs Norman pulled away from moves, Ernestine tugged harder, grasping Norman's hands and telling him what to do with his feet. \"When I step in, you step out. Okay?\"\n\nErnestine stepped out, and then Norman stepped out.\n\n\"Not like that! In rhythm, I go in, you do the opposite. Just do the opposite of what I'm doing with my feet.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean.\" Norman tried, effortlessly stepping on Ernestine's toes and repeating himself on the next attempt.\n\n\"Okay! Change of plan! You lead.\" Norman took a step forward, Ernestine took a step backward. Soon enough, the one-two rhythm was taking hold, and Norman was starting to understand what exactly it takes to dance- a little bit of confidence.\n\n\"You're getting it Norman! Bravo! Now there's one last thing. I want you to remember it, because you're going to go teach a nice woman after me.\"\n\nErnestine started to lean in and out with Norman, in anticipation of what was next. She let her left hand free from Norman, thrusting her way into a full spin. Norman burst into an excited giggle, amazed at what just happened.\n\n\"Now you!\" What happened next could be considered Norman's most elegant moment of his life. Just like Ernestine, he let go of his left hand, letting the heel of his foot and the spinning arm of Ernestine lead him in a circle. He came to a stop awkwardly, but it was the energy he needed, he was having fun.\n\n\"Now the real test, okay?\" said Ernestine, now leading the in's and out's of steps with Norman without either of them needing to look.\n\nErnestine spun Norman around, placing both hands on his back. \"Good luck kiddo. Love you. Go have some fun!\"\n\nErnestine shoved Norman free, deeper into the group of dancers, straight into the the person he's been avoiding most- Suzanne. She was a little startled to see him pop into the group like this, but mostly she was startled to see him dancing at all.\n\nNorman danced all right- Coming up with moves on his own, as well as going through the repertoire of dance moves from movies he'd watched- a little bit of Pulp Fiction followed by Dirty Dancing, which blended quite well with Napoleon Dynamite. Suzanne couldn't help smiling, trying to keep up with Norman, and once they locked hands- Norman the Dance Instructor was in business.\n\n\"You know the one and two step?\" asked Norman.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nWithout answering, Norman started to move his feet back, Suzanne picking up quickly and following suit. Soon they were in the full swing of things, *You're the one that I want* setting the tempo, a wild tempo that had Norman and Suzanne giggling like teenagers as they tried to keep up with one another.\n\nThe song ended, and another began- *Un anno d'amore*\\- and it was a slow one, a break in between, a different style of dancing requiring some subtlety.\n\n\"Norman,\" asked Suzanne, taking on an old southern accent, \"Would you care for this dance?\"\n\n\"I do declare I would,\" said Norman, adopting the small town ballroom persona that was being called for. Norman placed his hand on her hip, her wrapping an arm around Norman's shoulders. They started to sway back and forth, nothing but the song filling the air.\n\nNorman was surprised, if there was any way for him to express his conflicting emotions. It's been a long time since he's seen Suzanne, a part of him always imagined it would be a scene of forgiveness, acceptance, the two of them reuniting and falling in love. Though that dream ended years ago, not out of a loss of a romantic bone, but the situation that he found himself in. He knew it was for the best they separated. He would always be the \"what happened\" in her life, and the idea of what \"could've been\" always belonged elsewhere. And she found it- she was happy in her new life, in love with Jeff, living out the passions she always felt she missed. Norman had changed dramatically too, but his was more of a slow epiphany that took place over the last year of his life. He had new friends, the ability to be bold, to speak his mind, to fall in love. All things he accomplished on his own, the new person he's become able to learn from his past. Slow dancing here with Suzanne, Norman was aware he was living out the fantasy he used to have- but he's changed, and as wonderful as it all was, Norman knew he wasn't in love with his ex-wife anymore. Though he undoubtedly loved and wished the best for her, and he was glad the two of them could be together as the confident butterflies they transformed into.\n\nSuzanne nodded to her left, leading Norman's attention over to Junior and Gracie. They were in their own world, living out their own fun night and adventure. Norman's been in his own head too much this evening, and for the first time, he saw his son in his happy place.\n\n\"It was a bumpy road living this life,\" started Suzanne, \"but we did good. We raised that kid to be madly in love... and I have no regrets. This is such a beautiful day, I'm so happy. Are you happy, Norm?\"\n\nNorman smiled, letting go of Suzanne's and, surprising her with a full spin- spinning himself simultaneously- before they caught each other, back in the middle.\n\n\"I'm the happiest I've ever been.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [A Very Norman Christmas- Series Finale](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/ofiq4j\/a_very_norman_christmas_dinner_norman_part_57\/)","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1623072290.0,"comments":[{"author":null,"text":"[removed]","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1623094835.0}]},{"title":"Norman sees an old classmate.","author":"Hereiampostingagain","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/ntm9md\/norman_sees_an_old_classmate\/","text":"Norman was walking home from the nearby convenience store one day.

Norman felt like a businessman anytime he had to take a flight with a tight turnaround. He'd dress up like a businessman too, putting on a a grey suit and tie, a watch around his wrist that he would occasionally check, as if he had places to be.\n\n\"You look like you're going to a custody hearing, Norman.\" scoffed Ernestine, sitting beside Norman on the airplane. Despite her consistent jokes she's been making along the way, the seventy year old woman dressed up for the occasion as well.\n\n\"You and Francine...\" started Ernestine, prodding as usual, \"what's going on there? Any updates?\"\n\n\"Not yet, Ernestine. It's just... You know how it is, we've been over this before. We're on a pause.\"\n\n\"Still?\"\n\n\"Yup.\"\n\n\"Hmmph.\"\n\nAfter getting off the plane and booking their rooms in a nearby hotel, as well as changing from a grey business flight suit to something more appropriate, the two headed off to the wedding venue. It was a somewhat large wedding, a few dozen guests, though it still had a homely feel to it all. The dress code was loose, the tables full of finger foods, and there was plenty of young people, artist friends of Gracie and Junior coming from New York.\n\n\"Norman!\" shouted Gracie, spotting him from afar. \"Glad you made it!\"\n\n\"Hi Gracie! Congratulations! This is my friend Ernestine.\"\n\nErnestine shook Gracie's hand. \"You are a beautiful woman and you are absolutely glowing with confidence.\" said Ernestine. Gracie blushed.\n\n\"Junior's just over there, talking to Suzanne. Ceremony is going to be starting in a couple hours... I gotta get changed! Talk to you soon guys!\"\n\nNorman felt his stomach sink a little, a shake in his step as him and Ernestine walked towards Junior and Suzanne. Norman realized it had been almost eight years now since the two last saw each other in person; in the doorway of Norman's at-the-time new apartment. To Norman's surprise, she looked the same, albeit with a little more silver hairs than before.\n\n\"Hey Dad!\" said Junior, going towards Norman for a hug.\n\n\"Hey Norm,\" said Suzanne. \"Long time no see!\"\n\nAfter a moment of hesitation the two gave each other a hug as well. Ernestine watched Norman as he slipped away from the hug, fixing his posture and jutting his chest.\n\n\"Did you have a good flight?\" asked Suzanne.\n\n\"Mhmm! It was a very smooth flight. Do you know that there's a new line of aircraft they're releasing this year.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah?\"\n\n\"Yeah! So I've heard. Apparently Delta is leading the way with new planes.\"\n\nThe conversation peaked roughly around there. Suzanne and Junior, busy making the rounds and saying hello to the other guests, eventually split off and left Ernestine and Norman to their own conversation once again.\n\n\"Well that's the most bullshit I've heard come outta you, Norm. Planes. Really?\"\n\nNorman knew he exacerbated that situation. He hoped if he kept the small talk strong, he'd distract the situation from how emphatically uncomfortable he was.

He went up to the counter and gave the server a polite nod. \"Just the usual, good sir!\", Norman winked, trying carefully to find the right balance between being friendly and not \\*too\\* friendly. \n\n\\- \"A French Toast bagel with cream cheese coming right up! That'll be 7 dollars, thanks.\"\n\nNorman reached for his wallet when he noticed something on the counter that he hadn't seen before: A box of pin badges with an unfamiliar logo was on display next to the terminal. \"Donate to the National Alliance to End Homelessness\", a small sign read. \"Only 5$ for your support\".\n\n\\- \"You know what? I can afford 5 dollars, and that will be my good deed of the day\", Norman thought to himself.\n\n\\- \"Let me buy one of those pins\", Norman said, gesturing at the display. He felt a slight rush and let out a wide self-satisfied grin.\n\n\\- \"That's very generous of you, sir. That'll be 12 dollars then\", the server nodded with a kind smile.\n\nWhile fumblingly trying to insert the pin badge onto his cardigan with one hand while holding his bagel with the other, Norman walked out of the bagel shop and further down the street where he saw a homeless man on the opposite site of the road, sitting by the corner of a convenience store. He was holding a cardboard sign with crude handwriting from a Sharpie that read \"Please. Need money for food\".\n\nNorman stopped for while, thinking about that poor man and what kind of life he must be living. \n\n\\- \"I could change that man's life and give him a day he would never forget\", Norman started to fantasize. \n\n\\- \"I would take him to the barber and get him a haircut. I would give him some new clothes and make him look like an entire new person. I could even take him to the fancy italian restaurant down the block - just imagine the smile on his face when I tell him that he can choose anything he wants from the menu!\"\n\nNorman imagined giving the man a handful of dollar bills and seeing his tear-filled eyes of pure joy, as a warm feeling of pride arised from his kind hearted thoughts. \n\n\\- \"Yeah, I'm a pretty generous guy\", Norman convinced himself as he walked towards the park with a proud smile on his face.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1622590494.0,"comments":[{"author":"Dynamic_Rigidity","text":"good going Norman, careful not to get too high on yourself though :)","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1622764958.0}]},{"title":"A Phone Call from Junior (Norman, Part 54)","author":"MattressCrane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/np2qm5\/a_phone_call_from_junior_norman_part_54\/","text":">[Click here to go to the beginning!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hsvfbm\/boy_meets_girl_norman_part_1\/)  \n>  \n>[Click here for part 53!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/nhrfcq\/norman_and_francine_have_the_talk_norman_part_53\/)\n\nThe phone rang at ten o'clock, right as Norman was slipping into his sleeping clothes and brushing his teeth.\n\n\"Hello, Norman speaking.\"\n\n\"Hello, Norman Junior calling.\"\n\n\"Junior! Hi! I was just brushing my teeth. How are you?\"\n\n\"I'm doing good dad, how about you?\"\n\n\"Oh I'm good, y'know, just finished brushing my teeth.\" Norman Junior laughed, prodding his father on how it's always the same with him and his adventures.\n\nThe conversation went well between the two of them. Junior caught Norman up on some of the new things going on in his life- how his transition from finishing school and searching for work in the city was going. Norman filled Junior in on what was new with him, which wasn't very much, but he did catch his son up on how things were with Francine.\n\n\"Are you two going to start dating again?\" asked Junior. He never met Francine, but felt for his father, after all the praise she received in earlier calls.\n\n\"Maybe, son. I'm not too sure. It doesn't feel like the last I've seen of her... I hope.\"\n\n\"Well that's too bad. She sounded like something special.\"\n\nNorman mumbled along in agreement. The cat jumped on his lap, Norman quick to place the phone to the cats mouth and sent along a few meows.\n\n\"Hey dad I actually, uh, have some romantic news of my own! You remember Gracie, right?\"\n\n\"Yup! Is she okay?\"\n\n\"Yes, yeah she is... Well, I don't know how to say it, but I proposed. We're getting married!\"\n\n\"Oh! Wow! That's exciting! Good for you guys! She's not pregnant, is she? Not that it matters.\"\n\n\"Haha, no dad, she's not. Not yet anyways. We talked about waiting for some time, but... You know me, I'm a romantic and a little impatient.\"\n\nNorman was overjoyed, getting every detail he could out of Junior- how the proposal took place on an old boat, the plans to have the wedding the following October in an old homestead, and what Suzanne and Jeff are planning to get Junior for a wedding gift.\n\n\"It's not going to make you uncomfortable to see mom at the wedding, is it?\"\n\n\"Oh no, don't worry about that, son. Your mom and I are on good terms. Though haven't spoken outside of Christmas cards in... Quite some time.\" Norman paused.\n\n\"But it's okay. It's no trouble for me.\" he added.\n\nThe call ended soon after, the two wishing each other farewell and letting the other know that they loved them. Junior left it open for Norman to interpret whether he wanted to bring someone along to the wedding, if he wanted. If Junior got married a few months earlier, this would have been an easy answer for Norman. But now he's not so sure, at least as far as timing goes, he didn't think it would be wise to ask Francine just yet.\n\nThough he did know someone who would appreciate coming to a party.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 55: Junior's Wedding](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/nqljcy\/juniors_wedding_norman_part_55\/)\n\n&#x200B;","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1622465632.0,"comments":[{"author":"wcdma","text":"I really enjoyed this, thank you.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1622537223.0}]},{"title":"Norman eats his dinner","author":"A-Aron-Rod-gers","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/nnujuv\/norman_eats_his_dinner\/","text":"It was a Thursday night.

Unable to resist his bad habit, Norman immediately reaches for his phone on the nightstand and opens up the local news app. He quickly scrolls past articles that don't interest him; until a moving headline catches his eye. Norman scrolls back up slightly and reads the title: \"Today is your last chance to enter the town's vaccine Lottery!\".\n\n\"Great!\" Norman thinks to himself, \"this is a perfect excuse to go and get my shot during lunch hour\". Norman immediately springs to his feet and makes his way to the kitchen. He grabs his coffee tin and gives it a little shake; only to realize that it is nearly empty. Norman dumps the contents of the tin onto the scale and it reads 21g. This is 3g short of his usual 24g serving, but not a huge deal. Reluctant to do any additional math, Norman decides to use the same amount of water as usual.\n\nA few hours later, a bell notification alerts Norman to the time; 12:00pm. He takes one final sip of the watered down coffee, and makes his way to the pop-up clinic. Upon arrival, Norman is greeted with a well organized and fast moving clinic, a scene where everyone knows what they're doing. While in the queue, Norman hears a strict voice - \"Right this way sir!\". He looks up and sees one of the clinic staff motioning him over to a vacant chair.\n\nSeconds after sitting on the chair, a clinic employee approaches Norman and hands him a form; \"please fill this out and have your I.D ready\". Norman begins hastily filling out the form, as he worries he might be holding up the line. Right as he finishes, a nurse approaches and proclaims \"all set with that sir?\". Norman nods and hands over the form - along with some ID. \"Oooook looks like there are no issues, can you please roll up your sleeve for me sir\" asks the nurse.\n\nNorman rolls up his sleeve, and by the time he is finished the nurse is already swabbing his deltoid. The injection takes merely a second and Norman hardly feels it.\n\n\"All done sir! Your name has been entered in the lottery and you're free to go, good luck!\"; she smiles.  \n\"Thank you, have a good day\" replies Norman on his way out.\n\nSeveral hours later, Norman's sore arm convinces him to go to bed early. He changes into his pajamas, brushes his teeth, and slips into bed. Just after he shuts off all the lights, his phone glows up and vibrates twice. Norman picks up the phone and sees a notification from the news app - \n\n\"Vaccine lottery winner announced!\".\n\nHis heart races for a couple of seconds as he clicks on the notification and it opens.\n\nHe was not the winner.\n\nNorman chuckles to himself quietly, rolls over onto his unpricked arm, and goes to sleep.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1622331547.0,"comments":[{"author":"TwoSwordsClash","text":"Beautiful.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1622337943.0},{"author":"Station-Gold","text":"Two years later, Norman is dead.","upvotes":0,"created_utc":1622340508.0}]},{"title":"Normally Norman has a bath on Thursday night","author":"FlametopFred","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/nmniz7\/normally_norman_has_a_bath_on_thursday_night\/","text":"and tonight was no exception to moderately hygienic and totally normal Norman","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1622168251.0,"comments":[{"author":"Avocado_Pears","text":"Awesome","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1623086014.0}]},{"title":"Today is Norman's Birthday","author":"ObtuseRightTriangle","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/nlsaku\/today_is_normans_birthday\/","text":"Norman woke up to his 7:15 alarm this morning after a warm night\u2019s sleep.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I set two alarms.\u201d he thought to himself since he had unknowingly turning off the 7am alarm.\n\nNorman had a dentist appointment at 8:10 that morning \u2013 one that he scheduled months prior, forgetting that it would fall on his birthday.\n\nHe checked his phone for any \u2018happy birthday\u2019 texts or emails, but nothing was there.\n\nGetting out of bed he proceeded to take a shower, standing there silently, looking at nothing, for more time than he probably should have. After the shower, Norman dried off, put on some lotion (because he was starting to get over a sunburn), and began to brush his teeth. He brushed them a bit longer than he normally would. He even flossed with a more intent.\n\n\u201cI should probably start flossing more.\u201d Norman said to himself. He was right.\n\nAfter getting dressed he looked at the time. \u201c7:40?

That's his routine and it's just fine.\n\nBut today, as Norman's belly begins to fill, the front door seems to spontaneously slam closed, startling Norman, making him jump. \n\nNorman thought spooked, \"Why does this happen almost every morning?\"\n\nNorman decided today would be the day to investigate. Today, Norman would be doing something different.\n\n~\n\nLike a stone, Norman spent his day standing vigil at the door. A shadow would pass through the window, or a beam of light on the floor; sounds of birds or crawling bugs we're no distraction to Norman. Today, he would get to the bottom of this supernatural occurance. \n\nEventually, poor Norman's stomach started to rumble which evolved to a full-on growl. Norman would not budge. \n\nThe eclipse of the day was apparent; the late afternoon orange light appeared and slowly faded into a blue. Shadows soon fell in the dark home.\n\nNorman was growing hungry and tired and on the verge of surrendering. He has spent his whole day watching the door to no avail.\n\nAs Norman debated leaving his post, the handle began to jiggle violently, seemingly out of nowhere. The door was rattling, now banging, something straight out of a horror film. Muffled groans and swears could be heard from the other side of the door.\n\nFinally, to Norman's curiosity and horror, the door bursts open and a silhouette of a man with large items in his arms barrels in.\n\nThe silhouette stumbles around, scatters whatever noisy objects he's brandishing all over the floor, looking for something. He does not see Norman, but Norman sees the figure.\n\nSuddenly, the lights turn on before Norman could hear the click, and illuminates the a source of poor Norman's anxiety.\n\n\"Hi Norman!\" Exclaimed Norman. \n\n\"You must be starved little buddy. I'm sorry I'm home so late. I had a late day and went grocery shopping after. I hope you're hungry.\"\n\nLittle Norman went up to Norman and happily rubbed this face on Norman's legs. He was very hungry indeed.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1621649304.0,"comments":[{"author":"LoserFace369","text":"Had me in the first half, not gonna lie.","upvotes":12,"created_utc":1621649858.0},{"author":"mntucker10","text":"Very clever!","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1621654566.0},{"author":"goper2","text":"The rock was a nice touch, I chuckled.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1635618794.0}]},{"title":"Norman and Francine Have \"The Talk\" (Norman, Part 53)","author":"MattressCrane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/nhrfcq\/norman_and_francine_have_the_talk_norman_part_53\/","text":">[Click here to go to the beginning!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hsvfbm\/boy_meets_girl_norman_part_1\/)  \n>  \n>[Click here for part 52!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/nfqqg3\/the_kid_down_the_street_norman_part_52\/)\n\nThe trio walked into Norman's apartment, kicking off their shoes and letting the cat run freely through the apartment again. Norman was sure to close the window this time, as the cat ran up to the windowsill and splayed out, belly-up.\n\n\"Should I put on the kettle, Norm'?\" asked Francine.\n\n\"Yeah, that sounds lovely!\"\n\nFrancine turned on the kettle, Norman coming up behind her and giving her a kiss on the cheek. He felt his stomach turn soon after, as if he forgot he had been angry with her and went back on his feelings. It wasn't anger that he was feeling, but... wrong, wrong going back to the good times without acknowledging what's happened in between. From the looks of Francine, perhaps she was feeling the same way.\n\nFinishing the coffee, Francine came to sit down with Norman, and gave him a long hug, just holding him, before taking her seat.\n\n\"Listen, Norm...\"\n\n\"I'm sorry Francine. I know that things have been strange. I'm sorry I never called, or tried to let you know how I was feeling. I was just feeling... Unsure. Unsure if I was bringing you down with me, whether I was going to bring us to places I've already been. I didn't want your takeaway from our fight that I didn't want to be around you anymore. But I just feel like an imposter going through with it all sometimes.\"\n\n\"I get it. I used to get that all the time too, in past relationships, in life, and the thing is, I don't think it'll ever go away. But I think what counts is knowing where you are, and what you *did* do, and what you *do* deserve. No one deserves to be alone, same as no one must be with someone. I faced this myself, and more recently with my mother. It's a choice, one that comes with the good and the bad. I'm here for you Norman, but I can't be the answer to that issue for you. You need to want this, and you need to put yourself out there. I can't be the girl who comes into your life and answers all your problems... But I am here for you.\"\n\nFrancine stood up, bending over and kissing Norman on his forehead. \"I love you Norman. Give me a call when you're ready, okay? I won't wait forever, sure, but, y'know. When you know...\"\n\nFrancine walked out the front door, giving one last scratches to the cat.\n\nNorman stood from his chair, heading over and scratching his cat. On the wall the clock ticked loudly, He knew he would call Francine, no question- and in his heart, while he didn't know when that would be, he knew that it was what he wanted, and that let him ease up a little, knowing that in the end, he'd make the right choice.\n\nFrancine waved goodbye one last time before closing the door on her way out. Norman walked over the window overlooking the street, and watched as she climbed into her car, turned the ignition, and disappeared around the block. The apartment was quiet. He noticed the clock on the wall stopped ticking. It wasn't recent, as the time read 2am, though he never noticed when it died. It's been a long time since things were this still that he would even notice.\n\nThe cat meowed, hungry, searching for the apartment for her food dish.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get you some food,\u201d Norman said to the cat. Bending over to pour some new kibble, Norman realized that he never corrected his mistake from the day before. As far as he knew, Norman's food bowl was now in a landfill, tossed out moments before Francine showed up to help him. \"Time for a new food bowl,\" he said to his cat. Norman filled an empty can of peanuts full kibble, placed it on the ground, and gave his cat a loving scratch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 54: A Phone Call from Junior](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/np2qm5\/a_phone_call_from_junior_norman_part_54\/)","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1621600451.0,"comments":[{"author":"MattressCrane","text":"Well, this is the end of season 5 of this series.

After all, Norm' the cat hadn't need to spend a single night in the snow, and knowing that he was receiving more play time than ever with this young boy, Norman felt like this was a healthy vacation for the cat. Then, Norman had an idea.\n\n\"You know, sometimes I make... Out of town trips. Business for work, and the sorts. Ahem.

He took a minute to do some stretching, since his calves were still a bit tight from the walk earlier. \n\nMeanwhile, Norman skittered in between Norman\u2019s legs and leapt up onto the foot of the bed. \n\nJust as Norman was about to peel back the covers and join him, he heard what sounded like a knock at his door. \n\nHe plodded over to the front entry, checked the peephole, and sure enough his neighbor Fausto was standing outside. \n\nNorman pulled a mask on and opened the door. He was surprised to see Fausto out so late. His neighbor did a double take when he saw Norman in his blue and red checkered flannel pajamas and exclaimed, \u201cOh Norm, I hope I isn\u2019t wake you man. The wife was just walking the dogs and noticed your headlights were on. I figured I better come by and let you know.\u201d\n\nNorman reassured him that he was still wide awake when he\u2019d knocked and he appreciated the heads up. He asked Fausto to pass thanks to his wife Lydia, as well. \n\nThe two shared brief small talk over the progress of roadwork at the end of the street before bidding goodnight. \n\nNorman hurried out to switch his headlights off and then returned inside, changing from his outside shoes back to his inside shoes once more. \n\nHe settled into bed, giving Norman a good head scratched as he did, and picked his bedtime reading up off the nightstand. \n\nThe library had recently received a generous donation of westerns from a prominent townsperson\u2019s estate and Norman had gotten it in his head to read them all. \n\nHe was going in alphabetical order and was on the \u201ci\u2019s,\u201d currently working through \u201cThe Iron Rider.\u201d It was about a cowboy who\u2019d become as good a welder as he was a shot, trying to go back and fix the things he\u2019d broken in his criminal past, but realizing it would not be simple. \n\nNorman was so engrossed in the cozy thriller that he got almost three full chapters more into the story before noticing the time and forcing himself to turn in. \n\nHe didn\u2019t have to wake up at any particular time the next morning, but he felt better physically when he kept a consistent schedule, and he knew he wouldn\u2019t remember much of what he\u2019d read if he got too tired anyways. \n\nNorman couldn\u2019t find a bookmark so laid a fresh Kleenex between the pages instead. He made a mental note to grab a few complementary bookmarks the next time he stopped at the library. \n\nNorman flicked out the lights and snuggled deeper into his mound of pillows. With the sound of cattle stampedes and the warm rays of the Wyoming sun dancing through his head by way of the novel, he drifted into lively dreams, resting up soundly for whatever the next day might bring.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1621146691.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Norman is irritated by another iOS update","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/ncp5cq\/norman_is_irritated_by_another_ios_update\/","text":"\"Another software update?

Norman said, \"Why today the traffic is so heavy?\", the boy without taking his eyes from his phone and said, \"I don't know\". Norman got disappointed, but he tried again by pointing at the boy's phone: \"doesn't it mention anything about the traffic there?\", the boy said, \"No, I'm checking memes to just pass the time.

He opened the link and saw something that he couldn't believe. \"Life of Norman\" was the community's name that everyone was telling stories about a fictional character called Norman. He was shocked because he had some similarities with that character. First of all, he has a cat called Norman, and he was bald and remarkably unimportant individual, but the scary part was that some of those stories were about his real life.

Francine was a little more optimistic at this point, since she hadn't spent the last ten days worrying, and went for a more methodical approach to how they could search for the cat. Since Norman had already knocked on all the doors of his neighbors in his apartment complex, she ruled that out. Since he had no luck finding the cat hiding in alleyways or under cars, and also checked all the local shelters, she ruled out those plans as well.\n\n\"Have you tried putting up missing posters?\" she asked.\n\n\"I already asked every person I've ever known in this neighborhood, knocked on every apartment, went to every neighbors door.\"\n\n\"There's still people you probably don't know, Norm. Maybe someone else happened to find her, and you just missed it.\"\n\nLuckily for the two of them, Norman was a very photogenic cat, with no shortage of Polaroids on the fridge. Norman went for the most recent photo, one on the cat's birthday when Norman put on a nice suit and gave the cat some fancy tuna.\n\nAfter printing out dozens of copies, the two walked around the neighborhood, trying to hit all the locations that Norman was least familiar with. The open spaced laundromat on Duluth, the Chinese grocer on the opposite end of the strip mall. Cafe's with nice coffee, stuff that Norman's never dared to try without feeling like a false connoisseur. Though he did buy a croissant this time, a little more confident in saying french words with Francine at his side.\n\nThings went slowly for the following days after that. Norman would receive scattered calls, some people believing they found the cat, only to show Norman photos of different species. Francine would call Norman daily, seeing how he's doing, and checking in to see the progress of the search. They hadn't spoken thoroughly yet, about fight they had, or if either knew if they were still dating. The two agreed to help the cat first and foremost; the rest would come later.\n\nJust as Norman and Francine were readying to go out and hand out a new batch of fliers, the phone rang.\n\n\"Hello?\" Norman started.\n\n\"Hi, my name's Teresa, I'm calling about the missing cat?

And because he was very tired, he went to bed a little earlier than usual. He fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.\n\nThe heavy meal posed a challenge for Norman's digestive system. His churning stomach sent signals to his brain, which caused him to have a bizarre and vivid dream. He was a parrot, with stunning red and blue plumage. And he was gigantic. He flew not from one tree to another, but from one galaxy to another.\n\nAnd then he was perched on the Milky Way. Time seemed to slow then, and Norman became intensely aware of his situation. As the galaxy span, so did Norman, like a slow spinning top.\n\nIn the distance he spied the galaxy of Andromeda. A female parrot, with blindingly bright feathers, coloured like his, was atop Andromeda, spinning slowly like him. They rotated a few times like this, Norman increasingly disoriented, until on one turn, their eyes met.\n\nHe knew then his purpose in this universe. He had to fly to her. He lifted his wings. But then, as he launched, he realised below him was an infinite void. The endless dark into which he might plummet at any moment. And fear gripped Norman's parrot-heart, and he stopped beating his wings.\n\nNorman awoke in a panic. The dream troubled him greatly. He almost slipped over as he ran to the shower, wanting to wash away the strange and unfamiliar thoughts and feelings that being a giant parrot had given rise to within him.\n\nNorman ate his breakfast slowly that morning. Plain oats. He savoured the ordinariness of this meal. Soon he would forget the dream entirely.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1620789791.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Norman eats kibble","author":"Dj_Woomy2005","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/na32oh\/norman_eats_kibble\/","text":"Norman's cat, Norman, eats kibble, and enjoys it.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1620755657.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Norman normally had a glass of milk and some crackers before bed","author":"FlametopFred","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/n9r277\/norman_normally_had_a_glass_of_milk_and_some\/","text":"And tonight was no exception to the routine of totally normal Norman","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1620716672.0,"comments":[{"author":"lordperiwinkle","text":"I bet he has his crackers laid precisely on a small plate.","upvotes":11,"created_utc":1620773237.0}]},{"title":"Norman wants a burger","author":"boredoreoboreo","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/na8y6q\/norman_wants_a_burger\/","text":"Norman gained some weight during the lockdown.

A recent snowfall from the day before covered the city in a thin blanket of snow, the kind that was too dry to form snowballs but firm enough that everyone needed to come out with their shovels. Norman never cared for snow. It reminded him of Christmas, and he preferred to be the kid staying indoors all winter, watching television and staying warm under blankets.\n\nHe wandered into an old park, filled with dilapidated jungle gyms and a small field. The corners of the park were being used to pile snow from the plow trucks. It was a little too early for people to be wandering the park, so Norman was alone, listening to the crunching of his boots, with the faint hope of hearing a meow from the bushes. Norman took a seat on one of the swing-sets, using his forearm to melt away the snow on the rubber seat. His hands were cold gripping onto the chains, though he didn't care. He didn't want to let go. He knew that when he stood up and went home, it would be the end of his search for his cat.\n\nHe had to give up, and accept that maybe Norman would never come home. Spending the night in the snow was a scary image for Norman to imagine, but now, ten days later, he had a hard time telling himself that this would have a happy ending. It was all a mess, a mistake. This past year for Norman had seen him go through many changes; from opening up to Frank, to becoming friends with Ernestine, to visiting his son. All small moves, made one after the other,  leading to Norman being a different person than he was in the past. He had a hard time not feeling like an imposter with all the changes, that it was indeed all temporary, an adventure, or a set-back, before he was meant to return to his status quo. The family man he once was had died off years ago, back when Junior left for college. The confident man was also disappearing, a character he invented to change himself, but led to nothing, since he's never been truly comfortable with who he is. He would have to revert, to go home, and be comfortable with being Norman once again.\n\nBut he didn't want to be Norman anymore. Norman was content, and Norman was kind, but he was alone. That man was afraid of letting others get to know him, in the fear of ending up in a path where he gets left behind, once everyone else is ready to move on. He wanted to move on too. But without Francine, and without Norman, Norman would have to start this next chapter on his own, alone once again. That word stuck in his head, repeating over and over again. *Alone.* He couldn't help it. Norman stood from the swing, stuck his hands into his pockets, and walked home.\n\nHis apartment was quiet, nothing but the hum of the fridge and the ticking of the clock speaking out to greet him. *Just get it over with,* Norman told himself. He walked over to the cat bowl, picking it up, heading for the trashcan. As he held the bowl above the trashcan, his hand started to shake, dried kibble sprinkling onto the ground, the bowl falling loose.\n\nNorman started to cry, tears falling freely as he went to his knees. He didn't want this. He wasn't ready to move on. He wanted his cat back, he wanted Francine back. He regretted being silent, back when Suzanne dropped him off in this apartment so many years ago. He wished he could've said something, to be bold and speak his mind. He wished he spoke up more when Frank was fighting with Josie; as that window had closed, the marriage ending just the same as his. He wished he could've stopped Francine, to tell her he was just afraid, a self destructive mindset that told him he wasn't worth it. Most of all, he wished he left that goddamn window *closed* that night.\n\nJust then, Norman's front door opened, him unaware of the knocking on the door, only once it was open that he realized what a stupor he was in.\n\nIt was Francine.\n\nShe looked angry at first, as if ready to fight Norman, but once she saw him, a small man crying on his kitchen floor, she changed, dropping her coat and sitting beside him, holding him, asking him what's wrong.\n\n\"My cat ran away,\" Norman said, crying into her shoulder. \"I'm sorry Francine, I'm so sorry.\"\n\n\"Oh Norman...\"\n\n\"I'm sorry Francine. I'm so sorry.\"\n\nFrancine held Norman tightly, kissing his forehead. Norman was sobbing now, nothing holding him back, the waterworks and feelings pouring out of him. \"I love you. I'm sorry. I'm an idiot. I'm a mess. I don't want to hurt you. I just... I'm not good with words. I don't want you to think that I'm hiding things from you... I just don't know what to say sometimes.\"\n\n\"It's okay Norman, it's okay. I'm here for you, I don't care what it is, I'm just here, here for you.\"\n\nFrancine held Norman, crying together. He felt calm with her, breathing in, breathing out. He still didn't know what to say, but for the moment, this is what he needed most.\n\n\"Let's find your cat, okay?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 51: The Search for Norman](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/nc7w9l\/the_search_for_norman_norman_part_51\/)","upvote_ratio":0.74,"created_utc":1620651973.0,"comments":[{"author":"MattressCrane","text":"I'm not doing myself any favors for having people read this series haha.

He hopes he's far enough back in line to to have a little time to deliberate on his decision of what type of cheese he'll order to compliment his turkey. \n\n\"Number 37!\" shouts the hefty teenager in a hair net behind the counter. Norman's heart races, not feeling ready to make his decision. But there are people in line behind Norman, and this is a deli after all. Norman asks for one-half pound of classic turkey. He is momentarily hypnotized by the gliding deli machine cutting perfect slices of turkey just for him. *Snap out if it Norman*, Norman thought to himself as he focused his attention back to the cheeses. \n\nThe deli-man carefully weighs the turkey and places it in a plastic bag. It is one pound of turkey, rather than the one-half pound that Norman had requested. The deli-man asked if there was anything else. Norman could feel the pressure of the two customers behind him in line, yet to be served. Norman blurted out \"one-quarters pound of Swiss cheese\". He didn't know where these words came from, but he was pleased with his selection. \n\nNorman looks at the large bag of turkey and the small bag of Swiss cheese and considers saying something to the deli-man, but he was already on to customer 38. A second might as well be an hour in the deli business after all. \n\nWhen Norman arrives home, he carefully prepares his turkey sandwiches for the week. Norman quickly runs out of swiss cheese while still having a healthy amount of turkey on hand. Norman thinks for a moment about making cheese-less sandwiches for later in the week, but he shakes his head no. Norman puts the remaining turkey into the refrigerator. *We'll cross that bridge when we come to it*, Norman thought.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1619987680.0,"comments":[{"author":"GeneAudrey","text":"Gahhh what a cliffhanger!","upvotes":18,"created_utc":1620007072.0},{"author":"j00f","text":"That\u2019s a problem for future Norman.","upvotes":8,"created_utc":1620017284.0}]},{"title":"My First And Only Encounter With Norman","author":"reclusecaboose","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/n2c4cz\/my_first_and_only_encounter_with_norman\/","text":"Norman opened his eyes and noticed that his left eye was blurry. He groaned the words \u201cnot again\u201d to himself, clutching his head and noted how familiar the phrase \u201cnot again\u201d sounded to him. This was a usual waking occurrence for Norman. He was used to waking in a panic with blood pulsing through his face and head. He stumbled from his bed where most of his sheets lay tangled on the floor, thinking, \u201cwhat the fuck is wrong with me?\u201d and promptly vomited in the toilet. The sound seemed to resonate off the tiled ceramics and echo back to him. \u201cI can make today a good day\u201d Norman said, facing the mirror. He didn\u2019t necessarily believe his words, but he made a genuine effort to try to. He fumbled with the tops of medication, letting his fingers dance over the white circular lids, finding its way to the medication he disliked most. He pushed the child\u2019s lock down but never got anywhere. His fingers were worn with years of toil over the damn things. \u201cI can make today a good day\u201d he said again. No one was listening. The tv cast fluorescent light of blue across his bed, and Norman thought about how there should be a epilepsy warning, a seizure disclaimer, or some sort of medical label on the tv advertisement. But there wasn\u2019t one. He put on his size 11 slippers that had his footprints worn right into the soles, and closed his blurry eye down the 13 stairs he\u2019d memorized. \u201cCaffeine\u201d he grumbled to himself. \u201cCaffeine\u201d in his mind was a complete sentence, without any punctuation at all. He placed the coffee filter in the faulty machine and didn\u2019t count the teaspoons of pre-ground coffee he put in. He scooped over and over with the teaspoon until he thought that the carafe would be full, potent, and bitter. \u201cBitter\u201d he said. He shook his head. \u201cI am not bitter. Just strong. There is a difference.\u201d He shoveled enough sugar for two and let the milk flow until his coffee looked sweet. He took a tiny sip. It was too sweet. \u201cAll the more better to mask the bitter\u201d slipped from his lips. The shades were drawn in his tiny kitchen. Three very tiny ants were busy sweeping away bagel crumbs. He slipped a bent and crumpled cigarette out of his robe pocket and sat at his kitchen table. The pack of cigarettes on the counter proved that the cigarette was from the previous night. He took it onto his front step and he sparked his lighter multiple times, but it didn\u2019t light. He shook the lighter around, hoping the small drops of lighter fluid would mesh together. They didn\u2019t. He got up and searched for another lighter. He knew he had many scattered around his house, but he didn\u2019t know where they would be and didn\u2019t feel like going inside to search. He inspected the plants on the banister of the porch instead. Most of the plants were dying, or more realistically - dead. Yet, Norman called each plant by name. He watered them, even though he was unsure they\u2019d survive. He watered each stub and stick, until he came to his favourite plant, which was flourishingly beautiful. It\u2019s leaves we\u2019re bright purple, glowing flourescently, completely resilient to its lack of light and shallow potted soil. \u201cThe Northern Lights of plants\u201d is what Norman called it. It was scientifically called Tradescantia Nanouk, but Norman liked the northern lights better than science names. His fingers were grasping a lighter that was in his robe pocket. He knew that the lighter wasn\u2019t there before, just seconds ago. He was sure. He quickly dismissed the idea, knowing he couldn\u2019t fully remember the night before.  He lit his bent cigarette, looking to his own personal northern lights, and pinched a leaf between his thumb and forefinger. \n\n\u201cI can make today a good day.\u201d","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1619847423.0,"comments":[{"author":"yumiluvsourcream","text":"Can someone please explain this to me?","upvotes":8,"created_utc":1619856905.0},{"author":null,"text":"[deleted]","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1619904973.0},{"author":"rikbrown","text":"Is this a Christmas Carol-style vision of future Norman to come?

He was reading the last paragraph of an article about the rise of online video chatting during the pandemic when he his phone went off. It was a text from his friend Roger, whom he hadn't seen for, what? A few months now.\n\n\"Hey buddy! Long time no talk, really hope this pandemic will be over soon cause I want to beat you in bowling again!\"\n\nThe text came exactly at the right time. He didn't want to admit it, but Norman missed Roger. Before the pandemic had hit, every few weeks Roger and him went to the pub, or they went bowling, an activity that was always fun because they were both equally good at it (or equally bad, Norman thought) and their scores always went up simultaneously so the game was exciting all the way to the final throw. But now the bowling lanes had closed and so had the pubs and they both followed the government guidelines about not having people over if it could be avoided. Norman was glad to do his part fighting the virus but... He did miss his friend.\n\nSo Norman replied with a crazy idea. \"Do you want to try video chatting?\"\n\nThey decided to meet up the next evening. It took a while to get everything set up. It took Norman about half an hour to download and install Zoom and create an account. The software didn't accept normanthecat123 as a safe password and when Norman finally decided on a new one, the login screen told him frustratingly he had the wrong password even though he had just made the account! Then they struggled for a bit on the connection - Norman didn't have video, Roger had no audio, and although Norman thought it was kind of funny to nod and make gestures it was also a bit annoying. But, in the end, everything worked. \"Yes Roger, I can hear you, can you hear me?\" he said. And Roger did!\n\nIt was a lot more fun than Norman had thought it would be. They didn't talk about the pandemic or other negative stuff, but about their favourite episodes of CSI - Roger had a very different opinion than Norman, something that often led to intense discussions between them - and later rehashed old stories from university. They both laughed about a rather crazy night where they had gone out drinking and got so drunk they had crashed Rogers bicycle against a tree.\n\nTime went faster than expected. It was 23.00 before Norman had noticed. They could've talked for hours more, but they were also tired and had to get up early, and Norman admitted that his neck hurt a little. They said goodnight, and Norman shut his laptop lid down.\n\nThe evening had made Norman very happy. He hadn't realized how much he missed talking to friends. In a moment of rare vulnerability for Norman, he sent Roger a text. \"Had a lot of fun. I needed that!\"\n\nThen, on impulse, he sent another text. This one went to Norman Jr. \"Hey buddy!

He glanced at his old brown loafers, the brown laces worn and thinning, and wondered if he ought to try something new; after all, spice of life and all that. He set his shoulders and decided that yes, this would be the day. \n\nHe walked in, and instead of accepting help from an associate as usual, he made his way to the men\u2019s section. Ignoring the sounds of a small child spontaneously vomiting in the next aisle, as small children are prone to for reasons unknown, he browsed the size 10.5\u2019s with a watchful eye. The neon green sneakers? No, couldn\u2019t have anyone expecting him to exercise. Perhaps some patent black wingtips? Negative. Norman grew impatient, between the sounds of the child\u2019s mother ripping into a minimum wage worker and demanding to speak to Shoe Carnival himself, and the maddening question of what a \u201cHeely\u201d was, he was beginning to get a headache. Just as he was losing hope that he would ever get to spin the wheel and bask in the indulgent victory of a 5% off coupon, the hair on his neck stood up. Approximately 17.964 feet and a 49.6 degree turn away from him sat his saviors. A pair of shiny brown loafers with a subtle yet stunning set of black laces. For just a moment, all was right in the world; even Karen had stopped to take a breath, bringing a pause to the pterodactyl-reminiscent screeching that had once echoed through the store. He picked up the shoes as a father would caress a newborn child, and turned them over to look at the size. \n\n11\n\nThe facade came crashing down. Karen was filled a new wind and continued demanding to see the CEO\u2019s mother, little MacKartleigh vomited on a Nike display, and the associate, after being dubbed a \u201cShoe Carnival Clown\u201d by the blonde menace, immediately quit and had a breakdown about paying rent in the parking lot. \n\nNorman sighed, and picked up the pair of size 10.5\u2019s with tan laces. Sure, he could just buy black laces separately, but they wouldn\u2019t match the shoelace holes then. He set the size 11\u2019s down with the rest of his hopes and dreams, and got in line to pay. He felt the life creep back inside of him when it was his turn to spin the wheel, but deflated yet again after winning nothing. Truly disenchanted, Norman put his new box of shoes under his arm and went home. It was almost time to feed his cat, Norman, anyways.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1619557082.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Normally Norman read page 34 before bed","author":"FlametopFred","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/mziqjh\/normally_norman_read_page_34_before_bed\/","text":"and tonight was no exception","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1619507471.0,"comments":[{"author":"blackcurrantcat","text":"Seriously, Norman needs to read that page in daylight and move on to 35.

Open the curtains, make the coffee, feed Norman, get dressed for work. He sat up in bed and reached out to the alarm clock, the red numbers saying 06.45 but before he hit the button he realised it wasn\u2019t beeping. Norman blinked and rubbed his eye with his other hand- of course, it was Friday and he\u2019d taken the day off. \n\nHe got out of bed, put on his tired slippers and walked to the kitchen, where he found Norman waiting by his bowl. He filled the bowl, put it on the floor and watched as Norman hungrily ate his kibble. He noted to himself that he was nearly out of kibble and would need to buy some next time he went to the store. \n\nNorman crossed the kitchen to the coffee machine, inserted the pod and filled the hopper with water. He flicked the switch and as it chugged into life he remembered again that he didn\u2019t need to go to work. He noticed flecks of dust lit by sunlight, and leant across to open the kitchen window. Fresh air poured through the gap, and Norman heard voices and cars driving away and the soft rustle of leaves in the morning breeze. He considered his free day, and thought about what he might do with it. \n\nHe needed kibble and also new slippers, so going to the store would be a good idea, and he saw that the windows needed cleaning, which would be a satisfying job to tick off. He remembered an ad he had seen saying slacks were on sale in his preferred store so that was a possibility, and it was promising to be a lovely day.\n\nNorman finished his kibble. Norman watched him stroll over to the couch, where he found a patch of warm sunlight and busied himself licking every last trace of kibble from his lips. Hmm, chuckled Norman to himself, he\u2019s very particular, it\u2019s good that he likes to be clean. Satisfied with his licking, Norman tightly circled his chosen spot two or three times before settling down, his chin resting on his front paws. Norman watched his wide, round eyes slowly blink before he fell into comfortable, kibble-full sleep, whiskers full of dreams twitching. \n\nOh that looks good, thought Norman, really good. He heard the coffee machine spluttering behind him and remembered he needed to get milk and a mug. He went to the cupboard but the early morning sunlight catching on Norman\u2019s fur made him look twice. He noted the warmth and Norman\u2019s contentment and couldn\u2019t deny that it was tempting.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t waste the coffee though\u2019 thought Norman as the urge to lay down again presented itself. An outstretched paw from Norman, a flex in his right paw swiftly returned under his chin which suggested languishing, an alien concept to Norman and Norman thought \u2018my god I\u2019d like that\u2019. \n\nLeaving the coffee in the kitchen, inspired by Norman, Norman crept back to bed. He slipped into the polycotton sheets, and stretched himself out against the cool fabric. Norman thought about his plans for day- the shirts and the kibble, closed his eyes and went back to sleep.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1618989705.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Norman argues with himself","author":"Doomy22","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/mv2xt8\/norman_argues_with_himself\/","text":"Norman was attempting to move his pinky toe out of his sock hole when he happened to glance underneath his TV stand.

Norman stood from his cubicle and headed to the kitchen, grabbing his container of lunch, leaving it in the microwave. Conversations behind him sounded like noise, the whirring of the microwave taking his full attention.\n\nIt had been four days since Norman had his fight with Francine, and four days since his cat had gone missing.\n\nIt's not like he meant to lock his cat out of their home. At first, he didn't even notice the change, only that Norman had been acting quiet that day. Coming home from work he realized that the cat hadn't eaten any of her new bowl of food. He searched everywhere for her, and even though he thought about the window, he didn't want to fear the worst and hoped that she was just sleeping soundly somewhere.\n\nOnce it set in, that this was real, that Norman was missing, he panicked, frantically checking with the neighbors to see if anyone had seen her, found her, or heard the bell tied to her collar.\n\nNothing.\n\nOutside the front window was a small shrub, something soft enough that if the cat fell out of the window she'd be safe, but not able to easily jump back in. The thought of Norman trying her hardest to jump back home but couldn't... Norman was afraid. The following day he spent home from work, checking the animal shelters, scouring the neighborhood, walking back and forth through the blocks so many times he could do it blindfolded.\n\n*Francine.* As much as the fight mattered to him, it had simply been overwhelmed by the thoughts of his missing cat. He knew he shouldn't have said what he said, or more fittingly, what he didn't say. He cared about her. Maybe he loved her. Maybe he loved her more than anyone else in his life up until that point. It was all unwarranted, this self-doubt, and he knew it- but it was bubbling up quicker to the surface now that he was stepping into a period in his life where things were going well. It was a feeling of that this was all a performance, him pretending to be someone new, someone that doesn't really exist once he becomes too tired to keep up the new facade. It was a story, that's it, something that Norman was living through... Soon it would all revert back to his old ways, he felt, his old shy and embarrassingly content self. He wished he could talk to Francine, but he couldn't, not now, not while his cat needed his help.\n\nBut neither was happening, as much as he tried. He just didn't know what to do. On day five of searching, Norman gave in, and started to do what he feared the worst; checking ditches, under cars, in alleyway crawlspaces. In a way he was thankful he found nothing. It was getting colder outside, a final cold snap dipping back into the negatives. He went home, heating his fingers under his armpits, and digging his nose into a scarf. The apartment was silent, and it didn't feel the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 50: Norman is Alone](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/n93zq8\/norman_is_alone_norman_part_50\/)","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1618234083.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Norman has a birthday","author":"S0whaddayakn0w","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/movozk\/norman_has_a_birthday\/","text":"It was Norman's birthday today.

His cuppa, still too hot to drink, steamed at him from the heat-damaged spot on his desk. Windows chugged through its boot-up sequence for a few moments before his Big 3 started up automatically. Steam. Teams. Edge.   \n\nAfter checking the news on his homepage Norman got to work, still struggling with the subtle differences between the version of Excel he could use in Teams and the version on his desktop at work. He wondered, again, how deep the layer of dust was on his cubicle in the office. Was it more than a centimetre thick? Was the whole desktop encased in fluff like a Christmas tree in the snow? He corrected a cell reference error that Jason had failed to notice, as usual, and checked that the department's budget updated itself properly. Elegant!   \n\nAfter what felt like a thousand line-item corrections and a mere three visits to the kettle a Teams notification appeared in the corner of his screen.  \n\nLisa: Oh dear.   \n\nNorman: ??   \n\nLisa: Check the Beeb. :'-(\n\nNorman switched back to Edge and was momentarily confused by the ordinary Covid news he saw, before refreshing the page.  \n\n*Duke of Edinburgh Dies Aged 99*    \n\nNorman gasped, but quietly enough that Norman's ears didn't even twitch.

It was right, it was honourable, and it was dignified. Well done, sir.   \n\nBefore he really knew what he was doing, Norman stood up from his desk, tightened the belt on his dressing gown, and gave the BBC home page a three-fingered Scout sign, the only salute he felt qualified to offer.   \n\nAfter an awkward few seconds he sat back down, sipped his tea, and considered lunch.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1617993247.0,"comments":[{"author":"BurticusIV","text":"Amazing.

It was the tail end of winter, and the window overlooking the parking lot that the cat (Norman included) loved was beginning to be warm enough to be left open again. They just finished watching a rather less than romantic rom-com, a brain-twisting Jim Carrey film about a man erasing an ex lover from his memory. Norman found some parts funny, but at the same time he squirmed at scenes, holding his breath, hoping that Francine wouldn't notice how or what was causing him discomfort.\n\n\"I hope it works out for them in the end,\" said Francine, finishing up washing the dinner dishes in the sink. \"They're dysfunctional, sure, but it seems like they'll know better than anyone for how to deal with each other's shit.\"\n\n\"Mhmm,\" said Norman.\n\nNorman stood and looked out the window. He was nervous, tense, and Francine was starting to tell. She knew something was off for a while with Norman, but she never knew how to broach the subject, but figured now was the time, one as good as any.\n\n\"Is something wrong Norman?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Come on, I think you know what I mean. You've been acting different lately. I just find that you're... Becoming hard to talk to.\"\n\nNorman turned red. This was the time to say something. Perhaps he waited too long, this long stewing of thoughts never turning into something tangible enough to explain himself to her.\n\n\"It's just...\" started Norman, trying, \"I don't know.\"\n\nFrancine took a step closer, her arm reaching around Norman before he flinched away.\n\n\"Hey. What is wrong?\" said Francine, sternly this time. Norman felt like he was up against the wall.\n\n\"I'm just feeling unsure about things.\"\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"About me?\"\n\nNorman hesitated, a little too long.\n\nFrancine didn't want to take it personally, but the silence dragged on, Norman leaving the note hanging as long as possible before it was too late for her to take it any other way.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Francine, I'm just feeling so... unsure about things lately. I don't know, it's not you-\"\n\n\"-Jesus Norman, just stop there, please... I...\" Francine turned around, hiding the tears starting to swell. She headed for the front door, grabbing her coat.\n\n\"Francine, please, just wait a second.\" said Norman. She waited, and he had nothing to say.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I don't know! Just... Wait, I don't know. I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Well let me know when you do know what you have to say. I'm sorry for not being good enough for you.\"\n\n\"Francine...\"\n\nFrancine closed the door behind her. He regretted immediately how he handled that. He didn't know what to say. He didn't want to stop seeing her, he knew that, but the way he'd been feeling was overwhelming, and if he didn't acknowledge it, he would have regretted it. In the end, neither plan worked out. Norman was left speechless, with no plan for how to apologize to her. He wished he wrote something down on paper, to find a way to articulate how he feels, but he doesn't know. He just doesn't know how.\n\nAfter Norman closed the open living room window later that evening, things had changed a little too late. The cat had wandered out of the window hours before, and with the window locked shut, wouldn't be returning any time soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 49: Norman is Lost](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/mpduab\/norman_is_lost_norman_part_49\/)","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1617972778.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"A reunion of the 3 Normans","author":"Kvothestarkiller","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/mmw5jk\/a_reunion_of_the_3_normans\/","text":"\nSaturday morning, Norman Woke up  and  thought how nice would it be to visit Norman Jr. at school and with an unusual display of decisiveness Norman drove to Normans school taking Norman along with him.

For months the Greek city resisted, believing that it would be saved by the revolting king Mithridates, who had gained fame by killing all the Romans of Asia Minor in a single day, and whom the city had allied in the hope of freedom from the Roman suzerainty. But the rebel king never came, leaving the city with the humiliation of defeat.\n\nThe city slept when its walls were finally broken. At the sound of trumpets and bugles, the Roman general ordered, sword in hand, to put the city down. The men should be killed, because he did not want Athenian slaves, but the women would be spared, at least while serving the retribution of the troops. The nefarious order was only interrupted hours later, when the general, although not yet satisfied with the blood on which he was walking, was convinced that this was not just any city, but Athens. Her universal fame was like a title that granted her the right to be respected. Sleepy, Norman left his cell phone on the bedside table, considering, not without horror, how life was dependent on the lives of the dead. \u201cHow many other cities happened to exist for that same reason: the dead on whom we sleep?\u201d, he thought.\n\nWhen he finally fell asleep, Norman believed he was the one who brutally invaded the unguarded city. But after the furor that followed the fall of the wall, Norman was nothing more than a spectator of the terror. The screams he heard terrified him, the blood he trod did not seem to bring glory to Rome, and the fire that consumed the city was nothing but perversion. Norman felt that he was not among civilized Roman citizens, but among wanton, among men who sought pleasure in destruction. Norman walked among monsters.\n\nEntering a house, the only one that did not burn in the street, soldiers offered him the body of a captive young woman. It was for Norman's amusement, they said. However, in the face of the violence he was supposed to commit, Norman did not advance. The young woman was there, the men were holding her, but he did not move. Norman tried a step, but failed. Afterwards, it was no longer she they held, but his ex-wife. And she was not held by anyone, she offered herself to him. But it was not to him that she offered herself, but to a Roman soldier, a man similar to the lover with whom she ran away, the only man in Athens that he would like to kill.\n\nConfused, Norman burned with desire when he woke up.

As he drove, his eyes flicked idly to the sidewalk, subconsciously noting its cracks and uneven sections.  Something about the pavement clicked on a switch in his memory.  In a flash, he knew that a long-buried memory was emerging, like a blurry shape coming into focus as it rises to the surface from far below.  \n\nAnd then the memory snapped into consciousness:  He was once again nine years old, pedaling his glitter gold spider bike on the sidewalks around his small hometown.  There had been one stretch of sidewalk that he had particularly relished, by a school not unlike this one.  It had a slight incline, a couple of sharp curves where a parking spot was cut in, and a dislodged section of pavement that made a little jump ramp.  He was once again gripping his little paper bag of candy from the drug store against the right handlebar, and churning up speed as he approached.  He sped down the incline, wrenched the bike right, left and right, around the parking spot, and yanked back just as he hit the ramp. Imaginary cheers filled his young ears.  From time to time he would attempt a celebratory wheelie, but he could never get the hang of it.\n\nAll these memories came back to him wordlessly, in a flash of imagery and tactile sensations.  Norman wondered, not for the first time, where in his brain these long-ago memories stayed, and how could they endure if he never recalled them in the intervening decades?  Norman made a \"hmm\" face and continued driving, signaling for his upcoming left turn into the parking lot.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1617629121.0,"comments":[{"author":"MattressCrane","text":"I really love this story.

The best vaccine to receive is the one that's available,\" Norman murmured to himself. Even though Norman wasn't particularly at risk to the virus, he thought it'd be his duty as a citizen to receive the vaccine and ultimately contribute his small share to herd immunity.\n\nA few days after receiving his shot, Norman was ecstatic to hear that travel restrictions were being lifted, so long as one had their vaccine passport. All his missed opportunities flashed before his eyes. He always wanted to take a trip to the Grand Canyon, perhaps even visit Mount Rushmore to see  his favorite presidents. Maybe even risk it a bit and venture off to his local city, with all the exciting nightlife and restaurants. Norman shuddered at that thought. \n\n\"Maybe I'll eat one of those big burgers with two patties. And fries too.\" Norman couldn't stop giggling, thinking about eating at a restaurant past 8pm in the busy city. Small bits of nervousness struck him here and there, perhaps the waiter giving him the wrong order, or having to calculate his tip in a hurry so as to not hold up the line. But no, Norman had a plan.\n\n\"I'll just tip a $20 bill so regardless of what I get, I don't have to calculate anything!\"\n\nYes, that was perfect. After all, Norman received his vaccination and deserved a memorable night.\n\nAnd so he did just that. In his dream, he even managed to put an egg in the burger.

He called it, \u201cAn economical coffin for a man and his cat\u201d.\r\nHis skin as white as a ghost\u2019s, had light brown freckles scattered around his nose with age spots complementing them around his left cheek bone. He was a lanky man with sunken grey eyes which held a subtle softness to them. A handful of balding light brown hair clung onto his scalp loosely. His thin, pink lips parted exhaling, every time he felt the weight of his existence. Three deep creases ran across his small forehead and made a permanent home out of it. Every time he puckered his lips in, a semi-circular depression showed up around the corners.\r\n\r\nNorman wore his glasses, took out his iPhone, connected it to the little bluetooth speaker he had bought at Target. His wrinkly, long fingers ran down his carefully organized music collection, cumulated over the years. He looked at his tabby cat, resting on the sofa\u2019s head, \u201cPerhaps, Perlman could join us, Norman?\u201d\r\nThe cat purrs as if he expressed his approval. He smiles at the cat with the glasses hanging at the tip of his nose.\r\n\r\nThe music fills up the house as the sun takes its leave for the night. Norman brings two boxes out, one that would contain everything that he would be throwing away and one that he would hold onto. He didn\u2019t believe in donating things to charity. But he practiced recycling religiously.\r\nHe decided to clean the attic that remained untouched ever since his wife left him. \r\n\r\nNorman tied a piece of cloth around his face before pulling down the attic door. He climbed up the stairs and switched on the lights which were surprisingly still functional. His eyes well up, irritated by the dust and dull light. Eventually, he got used to it and opened a brown box. It contained old photo albums. \u201cMemories daunt the living,\u201d he winced thinking to himself. Yet, he picked up the fourth album and flipped through it. Pictures of him with his ex-wife when they were in their glorious twenties. He ran his fingers through his hair looking at pictures of him with a scalp full of hair and lively expressions. \u201cYouth and its gifts,\u201d he sighs. His palette turned bitter and his forehead creases deepened by the last page. He hugged the album, supines, looking at the ceiling. Unfeeling. \r\n\r\nNorman got on his knees, put the album back in the box, grabbed them and as he walked down the stairs, it made a rickety sound. The cat lifts its head observing his movements. He tilted the box downside, emptying its contents into the garbage bin. Removed the wedding band and threw it in, pouring kerosene generously. He takes the bin out to front. Moves the sofa to the deck. He lights up two matches and throws it into the bin. Goes back into the house, unties the cloth and gets a bud light from the fridge.\n\r\nNorman sinks into the sofa, the cat hops onto his lap and he pops open his can. The flames reflect on his glasses while the violin hits top notes in back. He takes a sip and scratches the animal\u2019s back with his left hand, \u201cWish we could burn that wench as well, right, Norman?\u201d \nThe cat purrs.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1617438643.0,"comments":[{"author":"FusiformFiddle","text":"I...

Lying beside the armchair, the animal is in a quiet, peaceful silence. His eyes, in the twilight of the living room, seem closed. He sleeps. \u201cWhat a honest and safe life,\" thinks Norman, \"to lie calmly in an armchair and sleep\".\n\nThe darkness deepens. The silence in the apartment scares and suffocates. Norman thinks it might be best to escape through the door and indulge in the lights and noise that come from outside. There seems to be celebration and joy; the pleasures of life all seem to happen. But the belief lasts for only an instant, collapsing in the memory that there was a time when he was out there. He knows what those lights are; he was a friend of those who liked to mess around; he even came to believe in their joy. But, at the end of the day, he would return to that same chair, faced with the same expectation that joy was out there for the next day.\n\nOnce again Norman looks at his dog. Now without thinking about anything else, not wanting to think about anything else. He bends over the animal and pets it. He starts in its head, scratches his nose and stops in its ear. Norman likes to feel the soft tips between his fingers, to bend them over and over again. When it feels the caress that runs through his body, the animal sighs pleasantly and begins to stretch: his eyes are half open and his mouth is strained, in a yawn, the ferocity of harmless teeth; wet licks return the cuddle. It is best to stay here. Staying here nothing happens to me, nothing bad or good, which is still a good thing.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1617213748.0,"comments":[{"author":"FusiformFiddle","text":"I really like this, but I'm irrationally annoyed that it ignores the fact that Norman owns a cat, not a dog.","upvotes":13,"created_utc":1617228635.0},{"author":"TonyAbbottsChestHair","text":"Does Norman the cat get along with the dog?","upvotes":8,"created_utc":1617223737.0},{"author":"DoubleGreat","text":"Good read.

I don't know if they sell pie crusts here.\"\n\n\"Well it's either that too many people like pie crusts that they're sold out, or that so little buy them that they don't bother.\" suggested Francine. Norman shrugged, distant.\n\n\"I want to live in a world where they're sold out.\" said Francine. Soon after, Francine found and confirmed with a stock boy- they indeed were sold out.\n\n\"God, I'm getting nervous.\" she muttered to Norman soon after. He was getting nervous too, but for different reasons.\n\nHe wasn't sure why he found this feeling so overwhelming, but it was just an uneasiness, a horror waiting to be found around the corner. Things with Francine had been going remarkably well these past few months. He tried his best to scare off the ideas of the time when things go wrong, when she will leave Norman, or when Norman will have to leave her before things get too bad. It's was an inescapable thought, deafening.\n\nIt was all bringing back memories of Suzanne, and the life he had before. He felt like a broken record playing these thoughts in his head, as if it was a volunteer position, tasked with tallying all the good and the bad. He felt stupid, stupid for being stubborn enough to not say anything at all about how he was feeling.\n\nLater that evening, after the crust was found and the chicken pot pie was baked, Norman and Francine made their way up the spiraling staircase that was Ernestine's apartment complex.\n\n\"What do you think, Norman?\"\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"I said what do you think?\"\n\n\"I uh... Sorry, I missed that. What?\"\n\n\"I asked you if you think we should tell her before or after the cobbler.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"While it seems scarier to say it up front, I think that if we don't explain the occasion early on she'll go the whole dinner paranoid, trying to sniff out the news on her own. I'm not sure. What do you think?\"\n\n\"I think... I don't know. I think we'll just have to read the room, see if she's ready off the bat, or if she's indeed too suspicious.\"\n\nThe keeping things to himself was starting to weigh on him.\n\nPart of what made dating Francine so nice was their openness with each other, the ability for him to open up to this new person about all his life from the years before meeting her. But now he was shutting up, afraid of what he feels getting in the way. But without that openness they once had, what was the point?\n\n\"You okay, Norm'?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Norman, quietly.\n\n\"It's gonna be okay. Just let me do the talking.\"\n\nErnestine answered her front door, pleased to see her friends holding something that smelled delicious.\n\n\"Norman! Didn't know you were coming along!\" exhaled Ernestine.\n\n\"Well uh, I heard from Francine that she was bringing chicken pot pie... Figured I couldn't resist!\"\n\nThe dinner went along as usual, no real hiccups. It seemed that Ernestine was suspicious at first, sure, but once the pie was being sliced, the conversation turned its full attention to how delicious it all was. It was all making Norman uncomfortable, a moment coming that he couldn't rightly tell himself if he knew it was a big mistake or not. It was just too soon, too ready to slam the brakes and become derailed- Norman was thinking of ending things.\n\n\"Hey mom, uh... There's something actually I wanted to tell you tonight.\"\n\n\"So it was a distraction chicken pot pie?\"\n\n\"Yes. Bare with me, its not all terrible news, depending on how you look at it.\" Francine turned to Norman, smiling nervously.\n\n\"But me and Norman have actually been... Dating lately. Yeah.\"\n\nSilence hung in the air. A slop of chicken slid off of Ernestine's hovering fork, silently landing on the doily. A look of shock- betrayal- disgust- and then a burst of laughter.\n\n\"You damn kids! Keeping secrets from me all this time! Haha! You're really weaseling your way into my whole life, aren't you Norman?\"\n\nFrancine squeezed Norman's hand under the table. Ernestine standing up and readying the plates for seconds as well as pulling out a secret bottle of good red wine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 48: A Window, Closed](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/mngjcw\/a_window_closed_norman_part_48\/)","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1617026784.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Saturday Norman writing copious haiku staring with this one","author":"FlametopFred","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/mejbit\/saturday_norman_writing_copious_haiku_staring\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1616869016.0,"comments":[{"author":"ArchangelSeph","text":"Norman takes pleasure\nin writing haikus because \nthey are short and sweet.","upvotes":20,"created_utc":1616869630.0},{"author":"CountryKit","text":"Norman loves a good\n\nhaiku as much as any\n\nTom, Dick, or Harry.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1616945128.0},{"author":"Ten_of_Wands","text":"Coffee perfect temp,\n\nGo to work on time, go home\n\nThen watch C.S.I.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1616950482.0},{"author":"Iambikecurious","text":"Watching CSI\n\nScratching Norman with one hand \n\nBeer in the other","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1616952620.0},{"author":"MattressCrane","text":"Not one to gossip, \nNorman thought the soup was fine.\nHe left a good tip.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1616988943.0},{"author":"Gigolo_Jesus","text":"Haikus are cancer, and I resent them metastasizing themselves into this sub.

Leaving his small apartment, he walked between identical doors listening to the indistinct sound of his neighbors' lives \u2014 voices on TV, a song, a man commenting \u201cdid you saw Robert post?\u201d and the woman answering no\u2026 And Norman recalled that even before the pandemic, when it was still allowed to take the elevator with someone, the greetings he exchanged with his neighbors were shy, distracted and indifferent.\n\nIn the elevator, he pulled his cell phone out of his pocket and stuck the earphone in his ears. After little searching, Thom York's latest album started playing out of indecision and anxiety. The peaceful melancholy of the rhythm of the music was comforting. Inattentive, his gaze fixed on the dial of the floors where red numbers plummeted: 13-12-11-10 ....\n\nHe was thinking about what he should buy at the market when he reached the ground floor. A young man, with whom he exchanged a brief look and wave, gave him passage. Crossing the lobby of the building, he saw that the janitor's door opened. A toolbox popped up at a glance rattling heavy tools that thrashed and rammed the wooden door. Old Melvin was going to some floor, to do some repair. Almost reaching the exit door, Norman, struck by the sudden need to carry the toolbox for the kindly man, slowed his pace, stopped and turned back. With a tired face and a mask under his nose, old Melvin held up a greeting to him with a hand that stuck the key in his pocket; Norman replied by raising an arm and a smile that hid in the mask. He was an attentive, harmless and very kind gentleman who walked towards the stairs. Seeing that the front door to the building opened to him, Norman thanked the woman who held the door for him and left.\n\nFew people walked the sidewalk. Coats and masks made them even more unknown, at least before the pandemic their faces were visible. On the horizon of the avenue that stretched indefinitely, the sun was reflected in the buildings, but didn\u2019t reach the streets. Spring was at the beginning and a little heat would be nice. Near the intersection, a few cars lined up at the red traffic light. In the distance, a siren; police, ambulance...? Norman sought the direction of the sound but found nothing. Around the corner, a cyclist came slowly down the sidewalk. The man, looking at his cell phone, was searching an address. A lady in a colorful scarf, glasses, and a book on her lap led Norman to think in his mother, with whom he had talked that morning, before getting out of bed. When he commented about the empty fridge and the market, she told him that he should buy olive oil, as it is always better to cook with olive oil. And, although Norman lives off snacks, rarely taking chances with pots and recipes, it wouldn't be a bad idea to start cooking something... to start learning to cook something, been more precise. It would be even healthier. The problem was overcoming his laziness.\n\nAround the corner from the market, which was on the same block where he lived, but behind it, Norman noticed a wine beanie, the top of a long, thin figure wrapped in a black coat, pants and boots and nimble fingers typing on his cell phone. Dark hair spread over his shoulders, running down the brown synthetic fur that seemed to line the inside of his coat. The woman came firm, powerful, able to run over anyone who stood in her way. Norman searched for his face hidden in the cell phone and mask, even lamenting his careless appearance of someone who, since a year ago, had little concern for himself, when she lifted expressionless blue eyes that stared back. Norman, like those shy children who curl up on their parents' legs and run away with their eyes away from the adult who wants their attention, fixed himself on the floor, as if to apologize for his indiscretion.\n\nAlready at the market door, Norman still looked for the wine beanie, but didn\u2019t find it.

And it was warm enough that he needed to get some of his short sleeved clothes out, but not warm enough to box up his winter clothes, so his closet was quite cluttered. \n\nHe\u2019d run out of gas just before getting to work and had to pull off at the new exit to fill up, making him late for an important meeting. Nothing was going his way today. \n\nAs he fished in his wallet for a card to feed the pump, he noticed a man lying beneath the entryway to the gas station convenience store. He couldn\u2019t help but stare at the man. There was just something about him. \n\n\u201cTom?\u201d He finally called out from the pump. \u201cNorman!\u201d The man called back, leaping to his feet and dusting himself off. \n\nNorman cautiously approached, from shock more so than fear. \u201cTom Meyer?\u201d \u201cThe one and only!\u201d Tom bellowed back, reaching in his pocket to dawn a mask. \u201cIt\u2019s been, what, ten years?

Norman assumed he\u2019d go far. \n\n\u201cAre, uh, are you ok?\u201d Norman asked, looking at what appeared to be an outdoor encampment set up outside the gas station. \n\nTom waved his hand. \u201cAh, this? Nah, it\u2019s nothing I\u2019m fine. Long story short, a few bad choices right out of high school, a few missed connections and blown opportunities, and... it\u2019s been a struggle on and off,\u201d he finished, the jovial boom fading from his voice. \n\nNorman tried to hide the upset from his face. He wished there was something he could do to help, but he knew there was no one grand gesture that could undo the lifetime his old friend had just alluded to. \n\n\u201cYou had breakfast yet? How about a coffee?\u201d Norman asked, figuring the best thing you could do for anyone when they\u2019re down on their luck is offer companionship with a hot meal. \n\nThey sipped their coffees and ate apple strudels on some nearby benches and talked about the years gone by. \u201cSo anyways, Norma moved out and I thought it was just a break. But we ended up going all the way with full blown divorce proceedings, court, the whole nine,\u201d Norman explained. \n\n\u201cWow, you were married?!\u201d Tom gaped, completely enraptured by Norman\u2019s account of things. \u201cOh yah.

I\u2019ve got to say, thinking back to the old days, I figured you\u2019d be lapping me by now. You know the place I work isn\u2019t the most exciting in the world but the benefits are good and the management is fair. I can put in a good word if you\u2019re interested in a warehouse position, or entry level administrative?\u201d \n\n\u201cYou have a job?!\u201d Tom gasped, eyebrows raised, \u201cNorman you better be going, 9:45 on a weekday. You don\u2019t want to end up sitting out here with me on the regular.\u201d \n\nThe two exchanged pleasantries and Norman promised to stop by again. \n\nAs Norman settled into work for the day, he felt a sense of purpose he had not experienced in years. \n\nHe enjoyed the burst of flowery perfume whenever the receptionist passed his desk that usually drove him bonkers. \n\nHe took pride in handing in the stack of quality assurance forms he usually balked at as busywork better performed by an intern or automated system. \n\nHe felt glad for the free coffee in the break room, even though it was lukewarm by the time he got to it. \n\nHe even managed to laugh at Consuela in sales\u2019 joke that she always tells about the commuting traffic, even though he\u2019s heard her tell it a hundred times, and usually roles his eyes at it. \n\nAs Norman drove home that evening he pulled off at the exit again and rolled past the gas station. Tom was still out there, after dark. He considered stopping by, but he didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d say. \n\nInstead Norman continued on home, feeling both light and heavy all at once. \n\nHe\u2019d meant to call and yell at the landlord about finally getting to the AC the minute he returned home, but instead all he could think about was how glad he was to be heading into a safe house with four walls and hot shower all to himself. \n\nNorman had to sell the old house in the divorce, and often beat himself up for needing to rent at such an advanced age. But tonight he pat himself on the back for going out, getting a job, and keeping it for so many years. \n\nHe thought about Tom as he enjoyed the warm water of his shower. Was he safe? Was he cold? Could Norman have done more for him that morning? \n\nAs he toweled dry he felt relieved to have a big bowl of hearty chili ready and waiting in the fridge, with a stove to heat it up on, and a pot to hold it. \n\nHe carried the bowl, thick scent wafting through the house, over to his recliner. He didn\u2019t even notice the odd position as he enjoyed the ability to take a load off and enjoy his meal with the local basketball game on in the background. \n\nNorman typically spent a lot of time thinking about how he could\u2019ve done better in life personally or professionally. But tonight, all he thought about was how nice a life he\u2019d built for himself. He gave Norm Jr. a call. He even left a message for Norma. \n\nAs he rinsed his chili bowl he finally remembered  to shut the pet door as Norman swished in between his legs. He vacuumed his carpets, something he usually grumbled about doing, but tonight took his time with. He straightened a few photos and paintings on the wall. \n\nThen, with his dinner and food for thought digested, he brushed his teeth, flossed, rinsed with mouthwash, used his water pick, and took his nightly pill. \n\nHe changed into a pair of worn navy flannel pajamas and didn\u2019t even stop to pick at the pills developing on the sleeves or mumble about the poor quality of his washing machine. Instead he smiled about the Christmas when his sister gifted him the pajama set. \n\nInstead of wincing at the disorganization of his overflowing closet, he made a note to set aside some clothes to bring to Tom when he saw him again soon.\n\nHe slid into his faux silk sheets and enjoyed the heft of his cotton-down duvet cover as Norman settled into a plump spot at the edge of the bed, with his feather toy close at hand. \n\nNorman dimmed the lights and, so overwhelmed with the emotions of the day, had to reread each page of his novel, *Ritual Costs* in order for the words to sink in, even though it was by one of his favorite authors and he had arrived at a particularly thrilling section. He barely made it through five pages before deciding to postpone until the next night. \n\nNorman flicked the lights off, took a deep breath of the bedtime air, a mix of shower moisture, carpet fibers, and the flowers just beginning to bloom outside his window, and promptly drifted off in a mesmerizing swirl of mixed emotions.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1616655605.0,"comments":[{"author":"thegimboid","text":"I think I needed this today.

It was Norman's favorite part of dating Francine, the sun rising, the relaxing notion of being there with someone, having nothing needing to be done. Eventually Francine started to stay longer than morning after, no longer waking and going straight to work. Norman and Francine would stay and have coffee, breakfast, listen to the radio, pet the cat, and it was starting to become Norman's new favorite part of being with her, mundane as it was. On weekends, after breakfast and after coffee, the two would sometimes still want to be with each other. They'd go on an afternoon date, visiting stores, hopping off at a different train station each time and exploring a different neighborhood. The exploration and sense of discovery he spent with her was changing him, making the city around him exciting again, as if he was a tourist in a new town. Sometimes it would bleed into the evenings, and they would go home and watch a movie together, falling asleep in each others arms, and he loved that too. Then morning would come. Norman was learning that he enjoyed all the time he spent with Francine, rarely regretting a moment, each worth loving in their own way.\n\nNorman was aware that they were still in the honeymoon phase, the six to nine month period of when nothing seems to be going wrong in a relationship. He didn't regret it one bit- these past few months have been the happiest memories he's had in years. Sometimes when laying and talking with Francine, Norman would think about just how much his life has changed this year, since the Christmas party. He was seeing a new side of himself, someone a little less intimidated by change, a person who's willing to stick their neck out here and then. It was different, the past self not quite dead, but at least happily forgotten.\n\nIt was a similar journey for him, the process of falling in love, when with his ex-wife. The times of traveling on the subway with Francine always sparked memories of riding the train with Suzanne. Sometimes the jokes would align- Francine pointing out how the trains squeaking doors sounded like the train was screaming in pain- was an observation that Suzanne made as well. Sometimes it got more intimate, Norman finding that they both liked to kiss his shoulder when leaning against him, or the way he'd brush the hair out the way, giving her a gentle kiss on the forehead before night. It felt special and personal, and doing those things twice made Norman feel like a fraud. Outside of the good times too, Norman was becoming acutely aware of the comparisons he didn't like to admit. Sometimes he noticed Francine being irritated with something, a tense shoulder and a hushed tone. Norman would ask what's wrong a get a vague answer back. He didn't inquire any further with Suzanne, and now that it was happening again with Francine, he was becoming painfully aware that this was a track he was following along, one that would inevitably end with the same fate.\n\nNorman tried not to think about those things. They would come eventually, he knew that, and he had no idea how to stop them from coming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 47: Following the Tracks](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/mfqaws\/following_the_tracks_norman_part_47\/)","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1616419307.0,"comments":[{"author":"SpellBounded69","text":"I need more!!!","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1616636427.0}]},{"title":"Norman Forgets the Stove","author":"mrpear","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/m8vp1i\/norman_forgets_the_stove\/","text":"Norman awoke with a start.

He remembers feeling nervous when his boss called him in to his office that friday a year ago and was surprised when he was recognized for his work, even though he had just kept on doing what he always had been doing. It wasn't a big raise, but Norman thought it was nice to be acknowledged for his work.\n\nWalking to one of the finer restaurants is town, dressed for the occasion, Norman felt confident. As he was shown to his table, he looked around the restaurant and felt slightly out of place among the sharp dressed businessmen and women. He sat down and looked at the menu. Norman wanted to treat himself and decided to go for a nice stake with creamed potatoes and a glass of red wine, Norman didn\u2019t unassay drink wine, but tonight was special. He practiced his order in his head a couple of times and looked at the waiter and smiled. The waiter approached and asked if he had decided on anything.\n\nNorman said his order and it was flawless. but when the waiter asked how he wanted his stake he stumbled. It had been a long time since he had stake on a restaurant that he'd completely forgot they didn\u2019t just make it well done like he used to do at home. \"well done\" Norman said with a small studder. \"and do you want it with garlic\" the waiter asked politely. \"Yes\" Norman said without time to think. He could feel his hands starting to sweat slightly, he never tried steak with garlic before. \"ok, let me know if you need anything\". Looking at the waiter, while he was walking towards the kitchen, Norman thought of the huge risk he had taken. He regretted his choice he met the waiter\u2019s eyes while he was bringing a wine glass and a bottle of red wine to the table. While the waiter was pouring the wine into the glass Norman was wrestling whether to say that he didn\u2019t want the garlic after all or not. Before Norman had decided whether to ask or not the waiter was finished poring the wine and was already on his way back to the kitchen. Norman had missed his window.\n\nHe enjoyed his steak with creamed potatoes and his glass of wine. He tipped generously and walked home feeling good about himself. He still thinks about how he got garlic without intending to, but he had just moved them to the side of the plate. when he got to bed, he realized that it could been so much worse and that the waiter could have wanted him to taste the wine before pouring.

It took a while to figure out how to set up his brand new laptop(!), get on Zoom calls, and all those other technology shenanigans, but at this point he had it all down.\n\nOr so he thought! For today, his coworker said something truly shocking. \u201cYou know, Norman,\u201d the young Melissa said, \u201cyou could stand to spice up your Zoom background a bit! It doesn\u2019t have to be a blank white wall like that - you could add a bookshelf, or a plant, or even a picture! I hope you don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve been stopping you from decorating your space!\u201d\n\nNorman was well and truly shocked! First of all, because the wall was off-white, but second of all because he had never even considered decorating his workspace until now! No one was stopping him at all, the thought had simply never occurred to him! He rather liked the off-white wall, but now he agonized that maybe he *should* decorate! Maybe everyone had been thinking poorly of his blank wall this whole time!\n\nSo Norman got to thinking. What could he do to decorate that area? He could use the bookshelf in the living room, but it was so dusty and also quite heavy. He probably couldn\u2019t move it by himself. What about the very nice snake plant by the window? Oh, but that already looked so nice when it was sunny outside. What on earth was he to do?\n\nThen, he remembered. Years ago, he took a wonderful picture. It was of his son, then a child, with Norman, then a kitten, curled up in his lap. They were sitting on the floor, next to the then dustless bookshelf and leaning against the then tiny snake plant, reading in the sun. A truly wonderful picture from a truly wonderful time. It had been tucked away in the attic for years.\n\nThat would surely spice up the place!\n\nSo Norman went up to the attic, coughing a bit at the dust that had accumulated. It took a while for him to find the picture, and when he did he simply looked at it. The picture was just as nice as he remembered it. He wondered how his son was doing now. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s fine,\u201d Norman thought to himself. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d call me if he really needed me for something.\u201d He reminded himself to make his weekly call. Though his son never picked up, it was better just in case. Though Norman understood of course, his son must be very busy.\n\nThen Norman frowned. If he put the picture on the wall for his Zoom calls, his coworkers would probably ask a lot of questions! They might try to get more details about his son! And while he generally didn\u2019t mind talking about his personal life, simple as it was, maybe his son would mind. His son might be embarrassed to have his picture in the background of Norman\u2019s calls like that! Norman realized that it wasn\u2019t very nice of him to put the picture up without his son\u2019s permission! \n\nWell then, he\u2019d leave a voicemail asking for permission on the weekly call.

He was in his robe, a gift from his ex wife from years ago. He didn't think of it like that, it was just his comfy morning robe. \n\nSince his work had sent everybody home, Norman had become quite the chef. He decided early on in the lockdown that he would take advantage of his newfound time now that he didn't have to drive the 32 minutes into the office every morning. And today he made a masterpiece. A perfect omelette! He smiled to himself as he slid it out of the pan onto his favorite breakfast plate. His mouth watered a little as he got his morning coffee from the Keurig, but as he walked back to the table, his phone made a \"ding.\"\n\nNorman got up from the table, slightly miffed that his perfect omelette might be getting cold, but he knew he should check his phone in case it was his boss. He walked over to the living room where his phone was and looked at the screen. It was another picture from his son on the app he had him download. He clicked the button to read it and a picture of his son and his son's girlfriend flashed on the screen. Norman knew his son was thinking about him and that made him smile, almost forgetting about his quickly chilling omelette at the table.\n\n\nSuddenly Norman realized something. He had never had anything he felt worthy of \"snap chatting\" to his son before today! He walked over to the table and smiled, thinking of his son seeing his snap of the perfect omelette. He framed the picture as best he could, rotating the plate several times until the morning light hit it just right. Norman snapped the picture and sent it to his son with no caption, because he wasn't sure how to put a caption on his photo.\n\n\nThen Norman sat down to eat his perfect omelette.

On weekends he would also treat himself to a few accompanying shortbread biscuits for dunking purposes. It was on such a weekend that Norman contemplated murder. \n\nNorman was one for tradition. He was one for doing things properly. No cutting corners! And his weekend tea was no exception. So when something got in the way of that he had to consider any possible solution, no matter how violent... and it did get violent. He did kill. \n\nHe had a matching teapot, sugar pot and milk jug set. Unfortunately at some point the sugar pot had been dropped and broken but Norman had quickly repaired it with the superglue that had been waiting patiently in it's drawer for years for such an occasion. His tongue pointed out from between his teeth and his eyes squinted in concentration as he solved the 3D puzzle. 'Aha!' he thought, with a closed mouthed smile, as it finally took its original shape again. \n\nHe liked to arrange all the items on a tray, along with a cup and saucer, a spoon, and a side plate with three biscuits. He also always included a sheet of kitchen paper folded into diagonals twice.  He rarely used this tissue, but somehow, not to include it would be absolutely unthinkable. \n\nThe tea had brewed and Norman inhaled a deep breath up into his nose, his eyes closing in satisfaction from the aroma. Everything was as it should be. The TV was on, the news would be starting in just one minute, giving him just enough time to settle down and relax. He had removed the milk from his fridge and poured some into the milk jug. Then the unthinkable happened. He reached for his main sugar pot, preparing to decant a few teaspoons of its contents into the smaller sugar pot, and noticed something small and black moving amongst the granules! It was ants! 'Damm those ants!' thought Norman. Every year the same! They infested his sugar!\n\n'I will go to the hardware store immediately to buy some ant poison' he informed his cat, bitterly. He did not want to commit murder but he did not see himself as having any other option. He sighed.

Hopefully by the final step, Norman would be awake enough to face his job for the day.\n\nToday was no different.\n\nHe grumbled all through his breakfast. It had been a challenging week at work, and he still needed to get groceries. Norman finished off his coffee, and headed to his bathroom to brush his teeth before heading off to work. He noted that his mouth had a particularly pungent taste, probably from the doughnut he had with his coffee. Norman surmised that his breath was abhorrent.\n\nGetting to his bathroom, Norman saw (once again) that he was almost out of toothpaste, but could probably get one or two more brushings before the tube was completely wiped. Absent-mindedly, he continued through the end of his morning ritual.

It was a video titled \"Literal Bible Angels\" or something  similar and was about Bible angels being so different from the idea  people have of them, or something along those lines. \n\nHe had no reason to  choose that particular video and he saw no connection with Carl Sagan  or his own tastes and preferences; yet he clicked. When said video  ended, he clicked on another one about the Sea People's and the collapse  of The Late Bronze Age. This one was a bit long and he found it boring so he moved on and clicked on a new one about the Egyptians. From there  he jumped to one about cosmic energies and from there he landed on one  about The Flat Earth... At some point Norman had an epiphany of sorts:  he realized that (1) the robotic voice in the video was speaking  nonsense, and more important, (2) for quite some time he had been  mindlessly watching stuff he didn't even like or have interest in. \n\nHe  looked at his watch: more than three hours had passed since he seated in  from of the screen.

Normally it would a signal for him to wake up, make coffee and start the day. But not today.\n\nShe breathed in, out. He could feel it, her heartbeat against his ribs. For the first time in many years, perhaps ever within this apartment, Norman didn't feel lonely. He was nervous for the night before, but now with the pressure gone, all that was left was this quiet morning of cuddles and heavy napping. She was older than Suzanne was- he couldn't help but compare the woman he knew in his twenties to the woman he knows now in his fifties. He was no spring chicken either, and he knew that. At one point during the night their bones creaked and cracked so loudly they couldn't help but laugh, as if their bones were made out of bubble wrap. Later, their armpits collided against each other too, clapping together and creating an intense and realistic fart noise that had them in stitches.

At 7:30 in the morning, as he was finishing his breakfast (two fried eggs, a piece of toast, and a couple cinnamon poptarts) he decided that within the next couple of hours, he'd go on a walk. After all, the woods weren't far from his house.\n\n\n\nSavoring the last few sips of his cooling coffee, he strolled into the living room and read a few pages of his book. Because he'd forgot to set a bookmark on the page from the night before, he decided to start the novel over again. The sun pierced through his window, illuminating the pages, and this reminded him to begin his walk.\n\n\n\nHe filled Norman's bowl with some food and pet the cat while he snoozed on the sofa. As he walked to the door and put on his shoes, he debated on if he should bring a light jacket. Well, why not? It might be cold and windy; it might not be. \"To err is human, to forgive divine,\" he reasoned with himself and grabbed his windbreaker.\n\n\n\nFive minutes later, he was on the edge of the woods. The birds called to one another, and off in the distance he thought he heard an owl or loon. *Why are they called that?* he thought to himself, but continued walking.\n\n\nIt had rained the night before, and the pines smelled fresh in a way that brightened his day. He had continued walking for quite a while; his legs should have ached, but today they didn't. Coming to a place barren of trees, he beheld a massive lake and stood to drink the sight in. A slight fog was building in the distance; was it going to rain again?\n\n\n\nSighing in comfort, he stood to admire the display of nature for a little longer. He cared not for what time it was, nor if he was hungry or thirsty. *I should do this more often,* he said to himself.\n\n\nOn his way back home, the sky had begun to darken slightly, and thunder rolled in the distance. He still heard birds as he got home, unlocked the door, and put on the kettle for some tea. Pleased to see his owner, Norman leaped up onto Norman's lap while he settled in for the afternoon.

It was going to be the third date, taking place at Norman's, though she would be bringing the food- salmon and veggies- something she claimed to be good at cooking. Norman was telling this to Frank, who normally never cares about Norman's weekend anecdotes. However, because it was interesting this time, Frank decided to chime in.\n\n\"So things are going to get serious tonight, huh? Third date?\"\n\n\"Third date?\"\n\n\"Yeah. The date where things get serious.\"\n\n\"Oh... I've never heard that before,\" Norman said, growing nervous.\n\n\"First date is getting to know the person. Second date is first base, and third date is second or third bases.\"\n\n\"Ah. I don't remember what any of that means, Frank.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to spell it out for you. Google it yourself. Wait until your out of the office.\"\n\nOnce off work, Norman went to google.com and learned what the bases were again. He shivered. He figured that it was at least the sixth or seventh date when that all would kick in, but perhaps things had changed in the last twenty years. Suddenly he felt like a teenager again, the nervous energy that accompanied knowing that he'll have to go out of his comfort zone drastically tonight. The thoughts and nervousness continued well into the evening, once Francine showed and the two of them cooked dinner together.\n\nSitting at his little breakfast counter with two stools, the two ate the fish in a comfortable silence, listening to music. Francine picked up Norman the cat, who immediately started to purr in her arms.\n\n\"What a sweetheart,\" said Francine. Norman nodded, busying himself with a glass of water.\n\nIt was getting late in the evening, the conversation they had went smoothly and effortlessly, though the two were starting to get a little tired.\n\n\"I'm getting sleepy, yikes.\" said Norman.\n\n\"Do you want to go to bed?\" suggested Francine, gesturing towards Norman's bedroom door.\n\nNorman nodded, not exactly sure what he could say without killing the mood.\n\nHe was glad the candles he lit in the bedroom before she arrived had burned out- it would have been pretty awkward, now that he thinks about it. Norman let Francine take the lead, the tension eased as she took a step towards him, kissing him, then kissing him again. She stepped into his room, took off her shirt, and he took off his. She climbed into bed, and then so did he.\n\n\"Do you normally sleep with all your lights on?\" Francine asked. Norman's center ceiling light was distractingly bright. Norman stood up and turned off the light, getting back into bed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 45: The Morning After](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/m2qxwn\/the_morning_after_norman_part_45\/)","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1615383345.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Norman's chair annoys him","author":"FlametopFred","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/m1t0ta\/normans_chair_annoys_him\/","text":"Norman's slightly damaged chair annoyed him every time he sat there but then he realized it wasn't really annoying enough to warrant replacing with a new chair.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1615365370.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Norman Gets Surprised Whilst Sitting on His Slightly Uncomfortable Couch.","author":"xAbsolutelyNobody","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/m14x31\/norman_gets_surprised_whilst_sitting_on_his\/","text":"Norman was sitting on his favourite spot of the couch, considering how much less comfortable it had become over the past year of lockdown. He wondered if this unfortunate situation could have been avoided if he'd made a conscious effort to sit on a different part of it every day. He sighed. It was too late to be thinking about how he might have avoided it, the damage was already done!\n\nHis sofa was of an understated design, beige in colour, and had been purchased on credit only two years ago... In fact, he was still making low monthly repayments on it. This really wouldn't do. Perhaps he could replace the foam inserts inside his well looked-after cushion covers? He'd look into the most robust type of foam, and perhaps even cut it to size himself. He would watch a YouTube video on it.\n\nHowever in the back of Norman's mind he knew that although he would research it, he would inevitably not actually get new cushions, as quite frankly he had other priorities on his to-buy list. He therefore somehow resigned himself to spending the next few years shuffling from one bottom cheek to the other every now and then, with the distant and somewhat ignored knowledge that the reason he was doing so is because the cushion was no longer adequately plump. Of course, he would not be in huge discomfort, but also not in the complete comfort that he would always know in the back of his mind was possible. \n\nHe knew of course that he, living alone, could just sit at the other, more comfortable end of the sofa, however he had grown fond of his favourite spot.\n\nAll of a sudden the first fly of Spring buzzed around his lounge and distracted him from his thoughts. He forgot about the cushions quite quickly.

He remembered watching Cosmos back in the day and how fond he was of the program and the man. When the video ended, out of sheer curiosity he clicked on one of the videos on the \"recommended for you\" section. It was a video titled \"Literal Bible Angels\" or something similar and was about Bible angels being so different from the idea people have of them, or something along those lines. He had no reason to choose that particular video and he saw no connection with Carl Sagan or his own tastes and preferences; yet he clicked. When said video ended, he clicked on another one about the Sea People's and the collapse of The Late Bronze Age. This one was a bit long and he found it boring so he moved on and clicked on a new one about the Egyptians. From there he jumped to one about cosmic energies and from there he landed on one about The Flat Earth... At some point Norman had an epiphany of sorts: he realized that (1) the robotic voice in the video was speaking nonsense, and more important, (2) for quite some time he had been mindlessly watching stuff he didn't even like or have interest in. He looked at his watch: more than three hours had passed since he seated in from of the screen. He couldn't believe it; he checked again just to be sure he didn't got it wrong. He didn't. That\u2019s odd \u2013he thought, it was almost like no time had passed, and yet it was well over bed time. He sighed, turned off the computer and walked away.

Dates with Suzanne was a fleeting affair, like coffee forgotten for so long that it left nothing but evaporated ring stains along the sides. There was the one time that him and a coworker, Lisa, were last to leave a work luncheon, and that felt a little like a date, in Norman's mind. If he considered the Christmas Dinner a romantic occasion too, then in a way he took Francine's mother on a date as well. Despite Norman's extensive dating repertoire, he was still a little nervous for this one. It was the second date they were going on, and even though the first one went quite well, he still had many butterflies in his stomach.\n\nFrancine and him met at the waterfront, a few blocks away from the train station. They talked about things other than their parents and children for once, Norman delving into his retired novel, the name of which he couldn't recall, and Francine told Norman about her glory days as a singer in a small punk band that never played out of the city. Norman brought up Norman, giving Francine a good chuckle.\n\n\"Why did you name your cat Norman, Norman?\"\n\n\"Well I didn't do it. But Junior wanted to make the cat *his* Junior, carrying on the tradition. I told him it might be confusing to have two Junior's in the house, so we settled on there being two Norman's instead.\"\n\n\"Well that's sweet!\" said Francine, bumping his shoulder on the street, her hand grazing his. Norman flinched, putting his hand in his pocket, and Francine took the opportunity to interlock her arm with Norman's. It was autumn, after all, and the air was chilly.\n\nNorman started to learn things more about Francine that night, personal and intimate secrets that can't be shared anywhere, not even here in this story. She talked about her divorce, the one that started the whole conundrum with her mother, and how it affected her. She didn't talk about her ex anymore than that he was a cold man, detached. When she left him, she forgot a lot of things, how to love, and how to love herself. She wasn't shy about how she felt- it wasn't that she was impatient or entitled, but that she had been through her hard times, and was a little more certain of what she wanted of her life.\n\n\"I believed for a long time there wasn't much I deserved, just a stupid and selfish girl... I don't know if I still believe that or not, or if there's nowhere left to go with that mindset. I'm tired of it Norman, and I'm ready for some change.\"\n\n\"Change is good,\" said Norman. Norman delved into the story of his son, but struggled to mention Suzanne to any large degree. It was a difficult subject for him, one he's done a good job repressing over the years, but now, he was starting to enter the world of similarities and comparisons that come with starting to see a new person. He couldn't help but notice them in Francine- from the way she grabbed his arm, to the laughs and looks he'd get as he tried to say \"excuse me\" to people on the crowded sidewalk. In a way it was comforting, to feel and talk like this with someone again, but it couldn't stop him from feeling afraid to where those memories ended up.\n\nThe date ended with them accomplishing nothing at all, going no places aside from wandering the streets for several hours.\n\nHis legs were becoming exhausted, but the conversation was strong and effortless, and neither of them was willing to say goodbye. Eventually the final call for a train was coming, and since neither of them wanted to pay for a cab, finally settled and called it a night.\n\n\"Tonight was fun, Francine. Thank you.\" said Norman, formally.\n\n\"So cordial! I do declare that tonight was fun as well.\" The train was coming to a stop, both Francine and Norman departed, ready to split ways a block later. Norman gave her a hug, and as the hug loosened, Francine grabbed Norman's face and kissed him. After a moment of shock, he kissed her back. Smiling, Francine forcefully shoved Norman away, and started walking home.\n\n\"Goodnight, Norm'.\"\n\n\"Goodnight, Francine.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 44: The Infamous Third Date](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/m1xlcl\/the_infamous_third_date_norman_part_44\/)","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1614952752.0,"comments":[{"author":null,"text":"Norman is in love, it\u2019s such a nice one.

He said it so confidently and casually, inviting Francine over for a dinner. All the experiences in his life this year gave him the confidence to speak bluntly like that, but nothing gave him the confidence that he would actually need to have this be a good idea.\n\nThe next day, in preparation for the dinner to come, Norman headed to the grocery store to find out what he could cook. He knew that his white rice and chicken meal might be a little too basic for a date, but at the same time, he didn't want to go overboard and cook something he had no idea how to cook well. However, Gordon Ramsey and the internet convinced Norman that Beef Wellington is the epitome of a fancy dinner. Once he bought all the ingredients and headed home, and finally saw what the recipe entailed, he felt he was in deep over his head.\n\nNorman hadn't been on a date in eight years. Well, even *that* wasn't true- him and Suzanne stopped going on dates a few years into their marriage, only family outings after that, but it was hard to consider what toddler Junior considered entertaining to coincide with romantic. The last date was perhaps when Suzanne broke the news to Norman that she wanted a divorce. Norman recalled that Beef Wellington was indeed on the menu that evening, as he remembered scoffing at the price.\n\nHe knew it wasn't a coincidence that he hadn't pursued anyone in the time since. He felt a responsibility to how things turned out, that perhaps if he were a different man, Suzanne wouldn't have left him, that she wouldn't have been so unhappy. He knew it was silly to hold himself accountable for her happiness, but it was true, his influence on her lead her to feeling trapped for eighteen years, a life robbed by being with someone who couldn't live a life worth sharing. He felt like a loser for a long time, someone undeserving of love, of being loved. He didn't know if that was any different now. It was feelings he repressed for years, a small bomb of insecurity, just waiting for a fuse. The Beef Wellington came out of the oven soggy, the pastry sliding off like a degloved finger.\n\nNorman started to boil the rice and bake the chicken breasts, a back up plan that would surely be disappointing. He was starting to feel embarrassed, sorry for Francine to have to come on such a lousy date. She was out of his league, and he knew that. She was confident, quick on her feet. He felt that maybe it was just better to quit while he was ahead, and keep himself in the mutually comfortable friend zone and having her just be the daughter of his good friend, Ernestine. Norman didn't even consider how Ernestine would react to all of this. Would she frown upon Norman dating her daughter? How would Norman feel if Ernestine started dating *Junior?* He thought about that, and the wild amount of questions of how that situation would come about anyway.\n\nHe felt terrible. This was a terrible idea. Norman considered picking up the phone and calling Francine, wanting to end this whole ordeal before it could begin.\n\nAnd then she knocked on his door.\n\n\"Hi Norman!\" said Francine. She wore a purple dress, carrying a small bag of pastries. \"I brought some dessert.\"\n\nNorman gestured for her to step inside, and he gave her a small tour of his apartment. It was a quaint space without a lot to describe- a front door with a mat for shoes and a stand for coats. The living room as the hub, the kitchen to the left and the bedroom slash bathroom to the right.\n\nThere was the recliner in front of the television, the bookcase blocking out the sun from part of the window. That was the end of the tour.\n\n\"How long have you been living here?\"\n\n\"About eight years now, I suppose. I've gotten quite used to it, I can walk around this place blindfolded.\"\n\n\"Is that true?\"\n\n\"I might be exaggerating, but I think I could!\" said Norman.\n\n\"Well let's try it. Blindfold yourself.\" Norman was intimidated for a moment, before putting his money where his mouth is, tying a rag around his face, standing in his kitchen.\n\n\"Can I have a glass of water?\" asked Francine, a voice floating somewhere to his left. Norman turned around, taking steps until his hand reached the cupboard. Luckily he knew he the glasses were always above the sink, and efficiently poured her a glass of water.\n\n\"Do you have any wine, actually?\"\n\n\"Mmhhmm,\" Norman mumbled. He poured the water down the sink, headed for the fridge, remembering the bottle of wine he kept on the lowest shelf. Francine continued testing Norman, getting him to get her some soap from the bathroom, and then a treat for Norman the cat. Norman went to remove the rag, but Francine stopped him first, grabbing his forearm.\n\n\"Hey! Hold on a sec. Would you like to try something for a little bit?\"\n\n\"Uh. It depends what it is, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Just trust me, it'll be fun.\"\n\nFrancine took Norman's hand, leading him out of his apartment front door, and into the elevator.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" asked Norman.\n\n\"You'll see. Or I guess, you won't, but it'll come eventually.\" said Francine's voice.\n\n\"What the hell are you doing, Norman?\" asked Frank. Apparently he was in the elevator too.\n\n\"Oh hi Frank. I don't rightly know.\"\n\nFrancine continued to push Norman along, out of the apartment building, and soon Norman could feel the hard thudding steps of walking onto concrete.\n\n\"What now? Can I take off the blindfold?\"\n\n\"Nope. Not for awhile. I want you to start walking, follow your nose, your ears. I'll be right behind you, making sure you won't walk into a bush or branch or traffic. You'll just have to trust me, okay? Now... Get lost.\"\n\n\"I think I know where I am already, though. It'll be hard for me to get lost here.\"\n\nFrancine grabbed Norman's shoulders, spinning him a dozen times in a circle. Nauseated, Norman had no idea which way he was facing.\n\n\"Scoot,\" she said.\n\nNorman started walking, his legs shaking with each step making him fear he was about to bash into a pole. He thought he knew where was at the start: heading towards the intersection with the convenient store he liked to stop at. But it was quieter than he remembered, and stepping off the curb into the street felt unusually steep. He felt grass under his foot for a moment- when was there grass on the sidewalk in *this* neighborhood? Norman felt properly lost, not the slightest clue where he might be. He had Francine's constant reassurance he wasn't going to wander into traffic, the occasional nudging of his shoulder to bump him out of the way of branches and other people. He trusted that he wouldn't get hurt, and soon he stopped holding his arms out in front of himself, very much so blindly walking the path ahead of him.\n\nSounds were becoming more pronounced, Norman listen into passing strangers conversations very intently.\n\n\"... Yah I must be a **Nouveau** girl, y'know cause...\"\n\n\"... You're mother knows **more about** that than I do, ask if she's...\"\n\n\"... But they might become a **standard rule** from now on, y'know...\"\n\nCars whirred by, birds chirping quieted down as the evening went on. Gravel was rewarding to walk across, the soft sensation a welcome break off the sidewalks and roads. He felt his was in a different world, or as he were a small child, listening again, an aspect in life not often explored in adults.\n\n\"You can take off the blindfold whenever you'd like, y'know.\"\n\n\"Oh. I thought we were waiting to get somewhere.\"\n\n\"And where would that be?\" joked Francine. \"You've been pretty aimless for about thirty minutes now.\"\n\nNorman stopped walking shortly after that, untying the rag from his face. He was glad to lose that smell of dish soap waiving under his nose, and his eyes went through a dramatic transition as it got used to the light around him. He felt like he woke up from a dream, sleepwalking his way into a new neighborhood. After a moment, he recognized where he was, about four blocks away from his apartment, in a small children's park that was busy in the daytime, but completely vacant come this time of evening.\n\n\"That was very... interesting, Francine.\" said Norman.\n\n\"Good or bad?\" she asked.\n\n\"Good. Definitely good. I can't quite say I can put to words why I liked that so much.\"\n\n\"It's something special, a chance to trusting and careless and beautiful at the same time.\" she said.\n\n\"Shall we go eat some disappointing chicken and rice?\" Norman asked.\n\nFrancine nodded, grabbing the rag and tying it around her face. \"Show me the way!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 43: A Proper Date](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/lycdqp\/a_proper_date_norman_part_43\/)","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1614176740.0,"comments":[{"author":"Cheeseshred","text":"First date in eight years and there's wine alcohol and blindfolds even before dinner.

He had some new things to look forward to, like finding the right place to park the Daihatsu in the mornings, and that the cat's new favorite sleeping spot was on the windowsill looking out at a small tree in front of the apartment complex. He always feared that Norman might jump out the window when he leaves it ajar, but he trusted that his cat would never be so bold to leap one story down into the bushes. He was happy with how things ended in New York, a fresh confidence that he didn't feel he needed to spend.\n\n\"I'm glad to hear everything's worked out for ya, Norm'.\" said Ernestine, sitting across from Norman at her kitchen table. It had been awhile since the two of them were on good chatting terms, but with the water settled and both of them reconnecting with their kids, there was a breath of fresh air in their lives. Ernestine was in a better mood, now taking the time to ask Norman if he wanted cream in his coffee or not before pouring anyways.\n\n\"The puddles outside my building have been getting worse,\" Ernestine scoffed. \"A grown man can drown in the one on the curb.\"\n\nNorman was enjoying this new rhythm in life, and just as he was getting used to it, tragedy struck. Going through the drive thru one morning on an endeavor for a sausage biscuit and coffee, the Daihatsu breathed its last breath, shutting off and never coming on again. Not only was it Norman's worst nightmare to be the person who ruins the lineup for an entire morning, he was shocked to finally meet the end of the road with his only car. Perhaps it was content with how things ended months before, holding out for one last road trip and passing away peacefully, its mission completed. It started to spew smoke out of the hood, and Norman was soon to be late for work.\n\nThe day went on as usual- Norman and Frank said morning to each other and continued to not speak at all, except for the time Norman noticed Frank dropped a pen on the floor. Lisa asked Norman for some help moving boxes to her car, and after work Norman returned to his old routine of heading towards the subway.\n\nNorman sat fiddling with the keychain still in his pocket. He never had much use for a keychain anyways- only his house key and car key were the only ones he needed. The rest were knick knacks, things he bought from gas stations with the thought, *that would be cool on a keychain,* like the small globe ornament and the lucky rabbits foot that the cat liked to attack. It was useless now.\n\n\"Norman?\" asked a woman, sitting across from him. It was Francine- Ernestine's daughter. Norman looked up, surprised and happy to see her.\n\n\"Hello! How are you?\" asked Norman.\n\n\"I've been good, can't complain. Yourself?\"\n\n\"Ah, I've been dandy, can't complain either... How about you?\"\n\nFrancine laughed. \"I'm good, Norm. I'm good.\"\n\nHe was eager to tell her all about the trip to Junior's, as it was her nudge that helped get him out the door, and she was ecstatic to hear that it all worked out for him. Francine caught Norman up as well with what's been going on with her, the improving relationship with her mother, and some stories about her work as a producer for a local news channel. He never knew that, and Norman realized their relationship so far had only really stretched over the dilemmas they were going through over the past year. He thought it would be nice to have a proper dinner with her, and talk as friends.\n\n\"You should come over for a dinner sometime!\" suggested Norman, as Francine readied to depart the train. \"I can make... I'm not sure. I can cook a few dishes.\"\n\n\"That sounds good to me. How about tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Okay!\" said Norman. Francine smiled, stepping out of the train.\n\n\"Okay, Norman. It's a date!\"\n\nThe doors closed. After the small surge of confidence flowed through Norman, he was hit emphatically with worry- he was going to be going on a date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 42: Norman's First Date in Eight Years](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/lre335\/normans_first_date_in_eight_years_norman_part_42\/)","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1613918927.0,"comments":[{"author":"MattressCrane","text":"Heyo!

Worried for a moment that he would have to queue for a long time, he was immediately reassured when a receptionist waved him over.  \n\nShe asked his name and date of birth, and checked that he was on-time for his appointment. Satisfied, she pointed him towards another member of staff about five metres away.  \n\nNorman walked to the man, wearing a hi-vis tabard and a disposable mask, who handed him a glossy leaflet from a table.  \n\n*The AstraZeneca vaccine: what to expect*. A rush of nerves flooded Norman's belly. He hated needles. The man asked him to take off his jacket, then pointed him towards a tidy paper booth, where a nurse was standing. It was hard to tell if she was smiling behind the surgical mask and the plastic face shield, but she didn't seem unkind.  \n\nShe asked him if he was on any medications or had any allergies. Norman didn't think so, though he wasn't sure if he should mention that he got very itchy if he wore wool. He decided against it and just shook his head, squeezing his jacket perhaps a bit too tightly. She handed him a card that had the batch number and the inoculation date already filled in, and told him to put it in his wallet.\n\nWhile he fiddled with his wallet she tore open an alcohol-free steri-wipe and dabbed it on Norman's upper arm. She dropped it in the rubbish bin by her feet and opened the sterile packaging on a syringe and needle. She assembled them with ease and used the needle to pierce the top of a small vial.  \n\nNorman looked at the floor over his other shoulder, his lips drawn tight into a line, trying not to wince.  \n\n\"You ready?\" she asked.  \n\nNorman nodded. He closed his eyes.  \n\nHe felt a scratch. It was nothing compared to the last time Norman had gotten too excited while they were play-fighting in the living room, but he felt it.  \n\nBy the time he'd opened his eyes the nurse was holding a small cotton pad on his shoulder, the needle vanished from sight. She reminded him that it would probably be sore for a few days, that he may develop a fever for a little while, and to take it easy. Norman listened carefully, then nodded.  \n\n\"All right, you're all set. You'll get another text message when it's time to have the second dose.\"  \n\nNorman pulled on his jacket and walked out of the building.

He had recently treated himself to a retro radio to remind himself of his youth and had the channel switched to one that exclusively played \"the oldies\". Norman had felt a little bit deflated hearing the music that sound tracked his younger years being referred to as old however the songs of today were just too noisy for him. He was sure the kids liked them but he just wasn't young anymore. As he turned onto chapter eleven, the presenter announced the next tune. Norman wasn't paying much attention until he heard the opening riff. Instantly he dropped his book and ran to the radio, twisting the nob up to a volume that he thought would be as loud as possible without disturbing the neighbours. Within a few seconds he could feel his feet tapping along with the drums and his head nodding up and down to the rhythm. Norman closed his eyes and caught glimpses of his dad playing catch with him in the park and his mum reading him stories before bed. He couldn't remember the last time he heard this song, he probably hadn't even thought about it for at least ten years but one thing he did know was that something about it filled him with immense nostalgic warmth. He found himself bobbing about his living room with a grin placed triumphantly on his face. The memories kept flashing before him like one of those slideshow projections they used to have at school: friend's parties, trips to the cinema, doing the paper round and ripping open presents on his birthday. The final chorus came with an uplifting push and Norman heard himself let out a laugh as he threw his arms out to embrace the world. All the childhood innocence and happiness had found him again and for those three minutes he forgot about work and mortgages and bills. Norman felt free. As the final lyrics were sung and the band played out, Norman opened his eyes again and saw his living room as it was: a stained carpet; a couch with a book lying on it, the page lost; and his new radio. It was over. The sudden emptiness pulled the smile from his face and left him awkwardly standing in the middle of the room. Norman sighed. He hadn't been listening hard enough to remember the name of the song. He sat back down in his chair and flicked through the pages of the book to make it back to chapter eleven.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1613749771.0,"comments":[{"author":"l_siram","text":"He should've tried to memorise part of the lyrics so he could look them up on Google to try to find the name of the song.

He rests one hand in the glass and take a breath, resting. With his other hand, he pulls the key and open the door. He does not enter immediately. He awaits the smell of upholstery and baked plastic fade away from inside of his car. He looks at the empty street, at the blue sky. There is nothing. He looks at the driver's seat. He mentally anticipates the movements that will take him to the comfortable position. Balancing between the open door and the driver's roof handle, Norman steps forward. Between one leg that feels for support in front of the bench and the other that holds him upright, Norman settles. The open mouth breathes dense and heavily, resting the heart. After a few moments, everything is in order: the heart, the breath, the arms, the car and the world. Norman stretch his arm out, reaches for the open door and close it. He inserts the key into the ignition and turns. The initial quiet explosion gives rise to the roar of the engine.

The host's accent had made it a little harder for Norman to understand the introduction anyway; not by a lot, just a little. \n\nNorman was mildly surprised when a male contestant mentioned his husband without any hesitation nor reaction from his fellow contestants. Not that Norman thought the contestant should have had to hide that about himself.

Norman supposed it depended on the state. Norman's state never put the issue to a public vote but he liked to think he would have voted for gay marriage. As long as his voter registration was still valid that is, and he wasn't busy that day. \n\nNorman realized that he had missed the deliberation period for the first question while he had followed that train of thought.

He liked to have his coffee with 2 packets of sugar and some french vanilla cream, from the pot he always started at exactly 6:10 am.  Norman usually liked to drink his coffee at the dining table while reading the morning news, though when he stepped outside to collect the paper, there was nothing there.  \u201cThat\u2019s odd\u201d, he thought, while dejectedly sipping his coffee.  He went back inside and switched on the TV to see if there was anything going on, because it was the next best thing after the paper.  As he flipped through the channels, he saw that nothing was on.  Norman assumed that the power had gone out at the station or some other issue had occurred, and decided that that morning he was going to finish the small wooden sculpture of a child he was painting at the moment.  He went upstairs to the little room he used for all of his small people, found the child, grabbed a paintbrush, and got to work.  As the hours went by, Norman used several different colors, a few different brushes, and plenty of other tools to carve and color his little masterpiece until he deemed it complete.  Norman felt a bit hungry after not having breakfast, and decided to treat himself by going out and grabbing a pastry.  \u201cMaybe I could get a danish\u201d he thought, because that was his favorite type of pastry.  He put down his figure, wiped off his hands, and grabbed his keys to go to his car.  As he opened the door, he came face to face with a zombie, which promptly bit him.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1613277751.0,"comments":[{"author":"woahdudechil","text":"Lmfao nice","upvotes":13,"created_utc":1613292792.0},{"author":"lldldiekdlofo","text":"DeleeeeeEeEeete!!

Norman pulled up in his car and parked right in front of the doors, which he appreciated more than usual because of the cold. As Norman stepped inside a set of bells rang at his arrival. Norman unbuttoned his jacket and removed one of his two hats. Norman always wore two hats when it snowed. Norman waved to the cashier, an older woman with the tan wrinkled skin of a trucker, and moved towards the coffee machine. Two women were using it at first, they got hot chocolate. Norman later wondered if they\u2019d have gotten coffee if it wasn\u2019t snowing. When it was Norman\u2019s turn, the machine whirred and steamed as he held down the button that filled his large styrofoam cup with cheap black coffee. Norman got distracted by a magazine while filling his cup, making him hold the button too long, so a little coffee spilled over the top. \u2018No big deal\u2019 Norman thought, and he was right. \n\nNorman popped the plastic lid on his coffee while he walked to the register. He spilled a little coffee on his hand as another man, bundled in what seemed like a dozen scarves, entered the store. After stamping his boots on the thin rug at the entrance, to clear the snow from them, the man removed enough scarves to where Norman could see his face. Norman recognized the man as his mechanic, or at least the mechanic that he went to. Norman didn\u2019t know what made a mechanic *your mechanic*. Since Norman knew him he waved, the mechanic nodded to Norman then shouted to the cashier, \u201cdo you have any pliers?\u201d She nodded her head yes and pointed to the back left of the store, and so the mechanic went there, rubbing his hands together for warmth.\n\n\u201cThat all,\u201d the cashier asked, though she knew it wasn\u2019t, when Norman sat his coffee on the counter. \u201cCould I get a pack?\u201d Norman asked, to which the cashier replied, as always, \u201csame kind?\u201d Norman nodded yes, so she grabbed his cigarettes and sat them on the counter by his coffee. Norman paid and left both the pennies he got as change in the \u201ctake a penny, leave a penny\u201d platter. Carefully handling his coffee, after stuffing the cigarettes in his pocket rather hastily, Norman made for the door. Norman prepared himself for his brief foray into the cold, snowy parking lot, and went outside. Norman quickly clambered into his car and placed the keys in the ignition, only his car wouldn\u2019t start. \u201cReally,\u201d Norman exclaimed, frustrated and confused as to just why his 20 year old, 2000$ car wouldn\u2019t start. \u2018Must be the cold I guess,\u2019 he thought to himself, \u2018what am I gonna do though?\u2019 That\u2019s when Norman remembered, by some stroke of luck, that he\u2019d seen his mechanic in the store! Norman rushed back inside so as not to miss him, and the mechanic happily agreed to help him, but Norman\u2019s car never started again. Not that morning, not the next morning. After that, Norman had it towed to a junkyard and sold for scrap. Norman made nowhere near enough to buy a new car, but made just enough money to afford his coffee and cigarettes for another month.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1613301870.0,"comments":[{"author":"LilithName","text":"wow, it is a nice story, I think its a bit sad that a story this long isn't really appreciated.

Few seconds later the stock jumps to 25.05, Norman is relieved that his purchase netted him a gain. He felt that this feeling of uncertainty could get out of hand very quickly, Norman took the decisive action to click on the sell button once and for all.

He thought to go out on the balcony with milk or wet chow to lure Norman back into the flat. Not that that had ever worked before--deep down he just hoped it impressed upon the neighbours that he was a good cat owner.  \n\nThrough the wall he heard a soft thud and a yelp.

They were thumb-wrestling as an older woman watched over them. One of the boys was clearly more experienced and wasn't afraid to show it. The mix of defeat and determination on the other's face gave Norman a mild sense of pride. It reminded him of his own headstrong son, William. \n\nNorman continued his usual route to the column he would lean against while waiting for his train. Anticipating his watch alarm, Norman placed his finger on the side his watch and silenced the alarm soon after it chimed. Norman peered down the track to find his train arriving just on time. \n\nThe roar of the subway's arrival muted everything else. Norman shifted off the support column and into line behind a handful of familiar passengers, each of which shuffled into their typical positions in the subway car. \n\nAs the train departed, Norman leaned his head back against the car window and closed his eyes. \n\nNorman's mind wandered to his days in primary school. He was known as a bit of a teacher's pet to Mr. Nelson. He followed every rule to the tee and was often called upon to take the names of students who acted out while the teacher was busy. Students who misbehaved would receive marks against their name on the behavior chart next to the chalkboard, on full display for all to see. \n\nOne day, Mr. Nelson had excused himself from the classroom unusually quickly, and neglected to assign a name-taker. Norman's classmates took advantage of the situation to descend into chaos. Norman recalled several forbidden activities taking place - running, jumping, climbing, paper airplanes, you name it. Norman quietly retreated into his desk, and eagerly awaited Mr. Nelson's return.\n\nJeremy, a student, enthusiastically approached Norman. He plopped his elbow down on Norman's desk and opened his hand. \"Let's arm wrestle!\", Jeremy exclaimed. \n\nNorman, keenly aware of Jeremy's patterns of misbehavior, thought he could more quickly get rid of Jeremy by yielding to his request. He grasped Jeremy's hand and counted down. \n\nJust as the contest began, the classroom door swung open behind Jeremy. Mr. Nelson had come back. Everyone darted back to their desks. Everyone except Jeremy that is, who was oblivious to Mr. Nelson's return. Norman feverishly attempted to get his hand back from Jeremy, whose sweaty palm was still clutched to Norman's, determined to emerge victorious in the contest. \n\n\"Norman?! I expected better...\", Mr. Nelson lamented. Jeremy, suddenly abreast of the circumstances, darted back to his desk. Norman watched in horror as Mr. Nelson applied a sticker next to his name on the behavior chart. \n\nThe sounds of the subway barely contained Norman's laughter. In the context of the other horrors in his life, he should choose to reflect on this one. Not of his wife leaving him. Nor of his son estranged. Nor of the grim prognosis from his doctor. No, not of these horrors which are surely consequences for crimes committed but of the one time in his life in which he was punished unjustly. \n\nNorman's laughter softened into a chuckle, and then a sigh. \n\nNorman fished his phone out of his pocket and tapped the screen a few times. His finger briefly hovered over the screen and tapped once more before he lifted the phone to his ear.\n\n\"...Dad?\", William's voice echoed.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1612689105.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Norman is late","author":"TheBrontosaurus","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/le1fhe\/norman_is_late\/","text":"HOOOOONK\n\nNorman jolted awake to the sound of a discontented driver outside his bedroom window.

Once outside, Norman paused to examine the contents of his take-out bag. It was a habit he\u2019d adopted after committing a particularly grievous faux-pas the month before. In a moment of uncharacteristic negligence, he\u2019d accidentally grabbed the wrong sandwich from the deli counter.

Not wanting to waste food, he\u2019d managed a bite or two of the stranger\u2019s sandwich: spicy Italian on ciabatta. His taste buds were still recovering.\n\nPeering into the plastic bag, Norman was pleased to find the rolls and salad accounted for; however, he didn\u2019t see a single packet of soy sauce. He glanced inside the restaurant. There was no lineup, but the staff seemed deeply engrossed in their work.

After deliberating for a moment, Norman gathered his resolve and headed back into the restaurant. He politely explained the oversight to the cashier, and she apologized for the inconvenience. In addition to several packets of low sodium soy sauce, she handed him a cup of complementary hot tea.\n\nNorman trudged back through the snow-lined streets, grateful to have a warm drink a delicious, heart-healthy lunch.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1612585429.0,"comments":[{"author":"yankonapc","text":"Way to go, Norman!

Reaching up, feeling towards the back, he finds a fine corked bottle that he could tell from touch alone.

For a moment Norman was envious of his little friend, but that was quickly pushed aside and replaced with happiness.\n\nNorman sat down in his lounge chair he had been so excited for when he first got his apartment, though it had largely been outdone by his couch and T.V.

Only to realize he had a report he forgot to finish up from friday\n\nWith a now empty cup of coffee by his side and a mess of papers on the desk, Norman has spent the last few hours finishing things up. He sends the repport away, and sits back in his chair to breathe out a little. A sense of calm comes over him as the email goes through\n\nSpending time in his childhood home always brings back so many strange feelings. Among them, he is always reminded of that strange dread he feels around his father. Its a strange feeling, because even though norman is now a grown man with his own view of life, he still feels torn on how he feels around his father. \n\nHe was in so many ways a fantastic dad. He did everything that you could ever expect of a father and more. But at the same time, Norman never really felt like he was ever very close to him. He felt more like a orbiting figure that payed the bills rather than like someone intimately close. \n\nNormans mother was always the one to give more of emotional intimacy in Normans youth. She would always be the one that gave reassurance when Norman came home with a bad grade. She would happily listen to how Normans day at school went and how he was feeling. His father on the other hand, would always be the one to deliver scoldings. Never anything abusive of course, but his dad was never afraid to be honest with Norman. About life and about people. Norman credits a lot of his grit as a man to these conversations with his father\n\nHe would also be the one to give practical advice. Looking for a job, fixing his car or how to act during job interviews. His father also had a general aura around him that inspired admiration from those around him. He had this sense of confidence and self respect around him. He knew that he was successful. He knew that he was respected. This often radiated around him. He felt like a natural leader.\n\nNorman looked up to his father in many ways. He often found himself imitating him even to this day in professional settings. But despite all of this, he still feels oddly disconnected from his father. Almost like he still judges him. \n\nNorman never felt comfortable being vunlerable around him. Even now, he goes out of his way to maintain composure around him. As he has gotten older, Norman has realized that its not always something to strive for. Sometimes you need be weak and seek help from others. Sometimes you need a hug.\n\nIn a strange way, Norman has resented his father. It has always felt like he was never really good enough. It doesnt really bother him now, but at the same time as he admires him in a proffessional sense, Norman has sworn to never be like him to his children. Norman knows how much some intimacy from his father could have helped him during his teens. He is determined to not be like that to his children.\n\nOver time, Norman has realized that there are often reasons why people are the way they are. Normans dad has almost never talked about his childhood. Father is mostly annoyed and uncomfortable around his mother, and he has never mentioned his father to Norman. Not once. All Norman really knows about his past is that he came from a poor family. He and 5 other brothers grew up on a farm in a rural area far from the big city. Its not hard to put 2 and 2 together and assume that he might not have had the most loving upbringing.\n\nWhile sitting in his chair relaxing, his mother comes up the stairs. \n\n\"Did you get it finished, Norman?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah yeah\" Norman sits up straight in the chair and starts clearing the desk \"It turned out well\"\n\n\"Good to hear... Must be good to have the evening free\"\n\nThe three of them had eaten dinner earlier. The dinner had unsuprisingly been somewhat quiet. They have always been a quiet family. Normans dad had however mentioned that he was planning to light the sauna later. It occured to Norman that he should be about ready now.\n\n\"You going to bathe with dad?\"\n\n\"No... not tonight\" She sat down in the couch in the middle of the room and grabbed the remote. \"I have a program I want to see\"\n\n\"But dad is down there now?\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\nThere was somewhat of a silence among the two. Until his mother spoke quietly again.\n\n\"Im sure he would really appreciate some company. Otherwise he would be sitting there all alone\"\n\nNorman prepared his standrard answer. This exact situation has played out many times when he was younger. Mom was never that thriled about the sauna, even though its installation was one of dads many passion projects in the house. Many times, Norman had simply declined. He never felt like spending one on one time with his dad like that.\n\nBut today, having come home for the first time in a long time, he started to feel different. Altough being home brought Norman many strange and hard to describe feelings, he also strangely looked at it in a new light. \n\n\"I think ill join him\"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1612274345.0,"comments":[{"author":"MythicalBiscuit","text":"Wow.

Happy would be an overstatement, but he quite liked the jingly music they played in the elevator that serviced his block of flats. Plus the cashier at the local bakery was always more generous around this time of the year.\n\nNorman and his family had never been ones to really celebrate Christmas. Sure, they had a plastic tree, and sometimes if the Christmas music came on the radio they'd have a listen. But their Christmases were never like it was on the Hallmark channel, with the red and green bedazzle of mistletoe kisses and cheeriness of family seated around a big, juicy turkey.\n\nNorman contemplated this as he exited the building and walked down the street. He saw a young blonde lady jogging in his direction, a flobby puggle in tow. He smiled widely at the goofy languidness of the dog and was grateful that the owner had been responsible enough to avoid its shorter-snouted cousin. As the woman passed him, she glanced in his direction briefly, a few strands of flyaways waving in the air as she jogged on.\n\nHe blushed, and was grateful that he had a mask on, not because the woman had looked at him, but because it would have been bad if she had seen his smile and thought he was laughing at her. Plus she was too young for him anyway.\n\nThe rest of his journey was eventful, and in a few minutes he found himself at the bakery. Jane (it said so on her nametag) who was working the cashier, was bopping her head to the Christmas music when Norman walked through the door. She glanced in his general direction and smiled a faraway smile. He could see because she she was wearing a clear mask shield.\n\nNorman smiled back, forgetting for a moment the awkwardness that usually coupled his interactions with young, pretty girls. Not that it mattered, because she back to gazing out the window.\n\nNorman walked up to the counter, and looked at the display case. There were some very lovely cakes today, on account of it being two days to Christmas Eve.\n\nHe didn't usually get cake for Christmas. There was no reason to; his family never gathered and even a small one would be too much to polish off.\n\nBut there on the very top row was a chocolate cake roll, topped with shredded chocolate bark and a dust of powdered sugar, shiny red cranberries twinkling at him...\n\nNorman remembered there was another name for the cake, but he  had forgotten his glasses and could not read the small print. *Yule something...what was it...*\n\nHe opened his mouth and breathed in. \"I want the...stick cake.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Jane. She looked at him, but he said nothing. \"Our newest addition to the limited-time Christmas offers is the yule log. Would you like to have that?\"\n\nNorman coughed. \"The...\" he mumbled.\n\n\"I'm sorry sir, you'll have to speak up. I can't hear you at all.\"\n\nHe cleared his throat. \"I'll have a vanilla cupcake, please,\" he said sheepishly.\n\nJane reached into the display case and grabbed a frosted cupcake from one of the trays on the bottom row of the display case. She shoved it into a white paper bag and folded the top over, handing it over to Norman as he paid.\n\nHe was a little appalled at her aggressive treatment of the cupcake, but said nothing.\n\nShe rang him up. It was taking a while. Jane was having difficulty finding exact change.\n\n\"That's alright,\" said Norman, not minding so much.\n\n\"Merry Christmas, sir!\" she called after him, smiling.\n\nNorman nodded as he exited, not that she saw because she was already lost, bopping her head to the music and carrying on with her people-watching.\n\nHe walked briskly, eager to make it home so he could have a taste of his vanilla cupcake.","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1612142334.0,"comments":[{"author":"ogresaregoodpeople","text":"Well written!

It was 9:15 on Monday and it was his first day back in the office since the pandemic began. Unlike many of his coworkers, Norman was secretly thrilled to be back in the office. He had missed his routine of waking at half six to shower, dress, make breakfast, and sit with Norman before leaving at 7:45 to catch the 8:03 bus to work. Although he still woke at half six every day, it hadn\u2019t been the same. He would never say anything to anyone else, he heard them grumbling about unnecessary commutes and meetings that could be emails. So secretly, to himself, he smiled to be back walking through the grey halls of his familiar office. \n\nWalking back from the kitchen Norman noticed a discomfort in his foot. Another few steps confirmed it - there was definitely something in his shoe. Trying not to limp and draw any attention to himself in the quiet hallway, Norman made his way back to his cube. Carefully he placed his coffee with one cream on a coaster next to his small potted cactus. The cactus was a wild Secret Santa gift he had received last year at the office Christmas party and it was the highlight of Norman\u2019s workspace.\n\nSitting down in his chair Norman swivelled from side to side and listened carefully. Hearing no one approaching he carefully slid a sensible brown loafer off his right foot and bent down to pick it up. His ears reddened as he imagined a co-worker walking in to find him with one foot exposed. He looked in the shoe and saw the offender - a small piece of pea gravel likely picked up on his walk from the bus stop a block away. Norman fished it out and placed it quietly at the bottom of his empty trash can. \n\nNorman looked down and stopped as he reached with his shoe. He stared at the black sock covering his foot and was puzzled. He could have sworn he wore navy socks today. Carefully he lifted his left pant leg and gasped  - his left foot was snugly encased in a very decidedly navy sock. Norman\u2019s ears blazed red and he felt his face flush behind his mask. Somehow he had worn mismatched socks on his first day back at the office! Quickly he stuffed his right foot back in its shoe and pulled his pant leg down as low is it went. \n\nHe leaned back in his chair and took a few deep breaths. He almost regretted having to wear the mask that made it hard to take a deep inhale but dismissed that thought before it fully formed; it was selfish. He looked down at his feet and could make out a thin strip of sock between each shoe and pant leg and blushed again. His first day back at the office was already ruined, he only hoped his coworkers would spare him the embarrassment of pointing it out. He was sure they would, they were all such professionals.\n\nSighing quietly Norman reached for his coffee. As he sipped he looked at his cactus and noticed how it had flourished in the months he\u2019d been gone.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1612125742.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Norman eats a chip","author":"yammyies","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/l974kc\/norman_eats_a_chip\/","text":"Norman sits down after a tiring day.

He offered to help her carry them to her house. The old lady thanked him and asked if he was interested in learning about Japanese culture and the language. She was a Japanese teacher in a university before retirement and wanted to continue doing what she loved. She was getting bored sitting at home anyways. Norman was also tired of his uneventful life and so he agreed to take Japanese classes from her.\n\nThe next day in the morning, with new-found excitement he visits the old lady's house. The old lady offered him some tea and then began teaching him Japanese. He enjoyed learning and spending time with the lady and listening to her many anecdotes. Norman's grandparents passed away when he was 2, so he never really knew how spending time with grandparents felt like and was glad because that's not the case anymore. \n\nAfter 2 weeks, the old lady began to teach him about the Japanese writing system. He discovered the logographic concept of Kanji and learnt that there are over 2000 Kanji that were essential to be known in order to read pretty much anything in Japan. He also learnt that each Kanji had different meanings and pronounciations according to the context of the sentence. All this was too daunting for poor Norman. He never liked doing anything that was even slightly difficult as he would feel incapable and would completely shut out the idea of continuing to do such difficult tasks. He conveyed what was on his mind to the old lady. She asked him to forget learning Kanji and continue with the more normal script called Hiragana. He declined because he felt even that would make him feel incapable, incapable of learning Kanji. The old lady was disappointed to lose her only student and Norman went back home.\n\nAfter 3 days of deep contemplation, Norman felt that it was this attitude of his that has stopped him from achieving anything significant in life. Besides, he read recently in an article that completing challenging tasks would leave people with a sense of achievement and make them more confident and happy. He wasn't happy doing the things he was comfortable with anyways. So he decided to continue learning Japanese. Besides, he would be losing a wonderful relationship with his teacher who had almost been like his very own grandmother. So he apologized to the old lady and even learnt 20 kanji in a day. The old lady was extremely happy that her student came back.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1612017234.0,"comments":[{"author":"yukaby","text":" \u304c\u3093\u3070\u3063\u3066 Norman- \u3055\u3093 !","upvotes":22,"created_utc":1612050652.0},{"author":"eatmorepies23","text":"Nice story.

Norman was driving through town on his way back home. He was hungry. Not desperately hungry. Not enough to give him the discomfort of hunger pains, but he knew that he should probably eat soon. He had heard that putting off eating messed up his metabolism, and he wanted to keep fitting into his pants for at least another few months. Clothes are expensive, or at least the ones he liked seemed to be. \n\nHe had been out for most of the day. It was his plan to be back a lot earlier, but the supermarket was out of light bulbs. He had to take a trek to the next town over, even though he could have sworn the supermarket had always carried plenty of bulbs. Today just wasn't his day.\n\nOut of the corner of his eye, he noticed the fluorescent sign of the pizza shop he frequently used. Norman slowed his driving down, and thought. It would take him a while to cook something decent, and he didn't really feel like instant noodles two days in a row. He thought he'd treat himself; he'd been good with his money this month.\n\nNorman parked his car in the parking area, and headed inside. He looked forward to a delicious medium double pepperoni; his favourite; and a bottle of cola. He approached the counter. It seemed dead tonight, unusually so for the time of day, but Norman was grateful that there was no line for him to stand in.\n\nBehind the flexiglass, clad in a wrinkled baseball hat with the store logo and an itchy-looking polo shirt, stood a young man that appeared to be in his late teens. He had ginger hair that poked out his hat and slightly curled upwards, with glasses in black frames. His name tag said Daryll. Norman wondered if that's the usual spelling, he didn't know if it was traditionally one or two \"Ls\" at the end. He thought it a little rude to ask, however, so he didn't.\n\n\"Good evening, sir\", said Daryll. \"May I interest you in our pizza of the month? It's our buffalo chicken special\".\n\nNorman almost dismissed the teen's suggestion outright, but he froze. Maybe he could use a bit of variety. He asked Daryll what was on the buffalo chicken special.\n\n\"Oh, it's really good, sir. It's chicken breast pieces coated in buffalo spice with green peppers, red onion and sun-dried tomato, all on a barbecue sauce base with spicy cheese on top, and a sprinkling of our special sauce.\"\n\nNorman thought long and hard. That did sound tempting. It would be nice to leave his comfort zone. But...eventually he decided against it. He didn't really care for sun-dried tomatoes. He could ask for them to be taken off, but he felt a little awkward to request.\n\n\"No, thank you. I'll have a medium double pepperoni, please. Oh, and a bottle of soda.\"\n\n\"Of course, sir. It'll be around ten minutes\".\n\nWhen the time came, Norman paid for his pizza and went home for dinner. It was good. Not great.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1612090434.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Norman takes a nap","author":"Muffinlookalike","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/l9fs97\/norman_takes_a_nap\/","text":"Norman was tired after a long day in the office.

Norman stepped out his front door and felt the crisp, refreshing breeze on his now bristled, 5 o'clock-shadowed face, which he really ought to take care of soon. He liked to walk if the weather was nice enough, but it was just a little chilly today, and even though it was only an 8 minute walk, he thought the better of it and went back in to retrieve his light grey hoodie with the cool little red stripes down the sides.   \n\n\nWhen Norman arrived, he was greeted by his good friend Joe, who had worked at The Sandwich Shop for 27 years.   \n\n\n\"Hello, Norman,\" Joe said.   \n\n\n\"Hello, Joe,\" Norman replied.   \n\n\nNorman walked up to the counter and ordered his favorite sandwich, The Sandwich, just like he did every Tuesday at 3:15 in the afternoon. He couldn't wait to enjoy that moist, savory turkey breast, nestled in-between the lightly sweetened, house-made white bread, warmed to perfection and topped with the gooey, melty cheese. Joe made the best in town.  \n\n\nSoon enough, Norman's meal arrived. \"Thank you, Joe,\" Norman said as he received his food.  \n\n\n\"You're welcome, Norman,\" Joe said.   \n\n\nJoe went back to his station, and Norman took his first bite of The Sandwich. However, as he was enjoying his meal, Norman happened to look over in the direction of the counter, and he noticed that Joe seemed to be giving him an odd look, which was not normal for Joe. Joe never gave people odd looks.   \n\n\n\"That's odd,\" thought Norman. \"I hope Joe is okay.\" Norman tried to forget it and enjoy the rest of his turkey, cheese, and white bread sandwich with the large water, but he kept noticing, out of the corner of his eye, that Joe continued to give him that odd look.   \n\n\nNorman wondered if he was having some embarrassing wardrobe malfunction, or perhaps there was an old stain on his grey hoodie he hadn't noticed before. He blushed at the thought and checked his clothing thoroughly, though he was sure these clothes were clean, and he certainly hadn't eaten anything messy today. Everything seemed to be in order, so he reluctantly continued his meal, somewhat at ease by the absence of any embarrassing stains.   \n\n\nA few minutes had passed and Norman was about three fourths the way through his sandwich, so he decided he would venture another glace over at Joe, just to see if perhaps he was imagining things and Joe wasn't staring after all. Unfortunately, Norman regretted looking, as Joe was indeed still giving him that odd look.   \n\n\nNorman was puzzled by the whole thing, not to mention a bit uncomfortable, and tried to think about why Joe might be giving him this odd look, this very odd look indeed, which was not normal for Joe. Was it something Norman said? Did he hurt Joe's feelings somehow? Norman wracked his brain for any ideas as to why his friend was looking at him this way.   \n\n\nThen, all at once, a most remarkable thought popped into Norman's mind.  \n\n\n\"Hey, Joe,\" Norman said.   \n\n\n\"Yes, Norman?\" Joe answered politely.   \n\n\n\"What day is it?\" Norman asked.   \n\n\nJoe glanced at the calendar on the wall and replied, \"It's Wednesday, Norman.\"","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1611802882.0,"comments":[{"author":null,"text":"[deleted]","upvotes":24,"created_utc":1611805317.0},{"author":"pngn22","text":"The \"cool red stripes\" is a perfect touch, I feel like you peeked into my mind and saw how I imagine Norman","upvotes":19,"created_utc":1611818876.0},{"author":"uncommoncommoner","text":"Brilliant.

He could just as easily buy a loaf of factory made white stuff at the store, but he preferred fresh made bakery bread when he had time to go purchase it. \n\nHe figured if he was going to indulge, it might as well be as pleasurable as he could manage with his meager resources. Plus, he liked to vote with his dollars and support local business when he was able. \n\nNorman dawned a surgical mask and a then cloth mask with a nice plaid pattern on top. He entered the Simmons & Son Bake Shop to wait his turn in line. \n\nThe woman before him was purchasing a half dozen vanilla cupcakes that looked absolutely scrumptious as Clyde Simmons packaged them into a powder pink takeaway box. Their pristinely white frosting crowns swirled into a mesmerizing spiral perfectly aligned against the pale yellow cakes plopped precisely into place within the cardboard holders and tied up with a classic strip of twine. \n\nNorman smiled at Clyde from beneath his masks and Clyde waved back with a gloved hand. \u201cHow do Norm?\u201d \u201cDo good. Yourself?\u201d Norman replied, getting a tickle of delight from the familiarity of being called \u201cNorm.\u201d \u201cOh things are just fine here. Working on my granddaughter\u2019s third birthday cake, that\u2019s the big excitement today.\u201d Clyde explained, gesturing to the back where his oldest sons, Clyde Jr. and Noel, were hard at work on a festive two-tiered cake with a drippy jam center.\n\n\u201cAlright, congratulations!\u201d Norman replied nodding in his sons\u2019 direction. \u201cWhat\u2019ll it be today?\u201d Clyde asked. \u201cUsual,\u201d Norman said, \u201cSeeded country loaf, sliced and wrapped.\u201d \n\nClyde set to work choosing one from the back wall as Norman enjoyed the faint aroma of butter and coffee that penetrated through his mask. \n\n\u201cHey is that Norman back there?\u201d Noel called, recognizing him from behind the cloth. \u201cHello there Noel. Many happy returns to your daughter.\u201d Norman called out from the other side of the counter. \u201cNorman, we picked your business card out of the jar yesterday!\u201d He called. \u201cYou get a free pastry.\u201d\n\nNorman was taken aback. They had never picked his card out of the jar before. \u201cYou don\u2019t say!\u201d He exclaimed, trying to mute just how excited he really was. \u201cSure thing. Pick out whatever you want, on the house.\u201d \u201cWell gee, thanks.\u201d Norman replied. \n\nHe scanned the racks and rows in amazement. He considered the chewy sugar cookies with their delicate rainbow crystals. The dense chocolate chip cookies with their rich cocoa morsels. He took a long pause on the spicy melt-in-your-mouth ginger snaps. But Norman had had plenty of cookies in his day. He figured he better try something he wouldn\u2019t usually purchase for himself. \n\nHe admired the ornate slices of layer cake with shiny lemon curds, fluffy merengues, velvety ganaches, and vibrant fruits oozing from their centers. \n\nThe yeasty donuts with crystallized glaze and gelatinous cream centers were quite tempting as well, especially as a young baker set out a new tray, fresh out of the oven. \n\nThe fragile chocolate bonbons topped with intricate  designs and flavored with exotic essences couldn\u2019t be overlooked. Norman wouldn\u2019t ever consider purchasing those for himself, not even on Valentine\u2019s Day. \n\nThe gooey puddings and chalky scones, each tinged with berries and served with a side of freshly whipped Chantilly cream, quickly drew him away though. \n\nRich brownies glitzing with frosting and dense fudge bars gleaming with candied toppings enticed him as well. Every shelf he turned to seemed to catch his eye and caress his appetite. \n\nUltimately though, Norman chose a plain vanilla cupcake, just as the woman before him had purchased. The moment he\u2019d seen childhood classic slide into the old style bakery box, he knew deep in his heart that he longed after a big, sugary, creamy, spongey, mouthful. Nothing would satiate him more than to enjoy the simple yet masterfully crafted flavors coalesce in expertly textured indulgence across his tongue. \n\nHe could barely contain himself as Clyde boxed the cupcake up along with his bread. He went out of his way to choose one with an especially puffy top for Norman. \n\n\u201cGood choice, just put those out.\u201d Clyde remarked as he rang Norman up for the bread. \u201cGlad to hear it, they look mighty fine.\u201d Norman complimented him as he took out cash for the bread. \n\nNorman dropped his change in the tip jar and Clyde thanked him as Norman collected his brown bread bag and pink pastry box to hurry home in order to enjoy this treat in his backyard\u2019s sun chair.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1611133474.0,"comments":[{"author":"ZebraBoat","text":"Yay for Norman!

He'd taken advantage of the overcast and lightly brisk weather to do his errands - he'd been so pleased and filled with a sensible energy by the grey clouds outside his window that he got an early start, and now he had the rest of the day ahead. Norman greeted him with a quiet meow as he sat down in his favorite chair. He reached for his favorite crossword when he became acutely aware that he was missing hundreds of books.\n\nNorman got up and began to look all over for the missing books. There had been so many of them - wide ones, skinny ones, older ones, slightly less older ones, bookmarked ones, all sorts of different covers (Norman liked the plain covers the best) and they had all abruptly gone missing. Norman rubbed the back of his head as he tried to think where they might have gone.\n\n\"I just had my Kindle this morning,\" he said to himself. He traced his day back in his mind, from when he walked out the door to when he went by his favorite coffee shop to grab a cup of tea (plain, no cream or sugar), the visit to the dry cleaner to pick up his scarves, and finally a brief stop at the office supply store to get a new box of pencils. They put them in such a larger bag than necessary, too. It was almost difficult to carry the pencils, scarves and Kindle. Suddenly Norman realized where it was.\n\nHe walked into the living room and opened the bag to find his pencils, the receipt for the pencils, and his lost books. All there, perfectly safe. He took out the pencils and admired their plain quality and packaging. He put the receipt carefully away so that he could put it in his budget later on. For now, though, it was time to enjoy the rest of his tea (not hot, but not lukewarm), and pick up his book. Norman was purring on the couch next to him as he sat down. He opened his book and found his place. The main character was about to make a trip to the grocery store, and Norman couldn't wait to read about it.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1610989921.0,"comments":[{"author":"VenetianFlame","text":"What a journey!","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1611027426.0},{"author":"LobsterKris","text":"Norman is my hero","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1611046583.0}]},{"title":"Norman makes an effort.","author":"Hereiampostingagain","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/l00pu4\/norman_makes_an_effort\/","text":"Norman had just gotten home after a long day's work.

He grabbed his masks out of his glove compartment. His sister, a geriatrics nurse, had advised him to try using a plain surgical mask underneath his cloth mask for two layers of protection. \n\nHe had a few KN95 masks but decided he wouldn\u2019t be in the store long enough to warrant a filter. Besides, those masks were plain white, and he liked showing off his cloth mask emblazoned with the logo of his favorite minor league baseball team. \n\nHe stabbed the car off\u2014he never had gotten used to driving a vehicle without an ignition\u2014and sauntered over to grab a cart. The nice store clerk he always saw was just finishing sanitizing the handles. \n\n\u201cHow do you do Brenda?\u201d \u201cAlright Norman, yourself?\u201d She asked, pulling out a new row of carts to wipe down. \u201cLong day, but a good day,\u201d she replied.  \n\nNorman nodded to her as he unfolded his list and started down the aisles.\n\nHe was first in the produce section, but he always likes to loop around there last so his delicate vegetables didn\u2019t get squished under his heavier meats and canned goods, so he bypassed directly to the seafood counter. \n\nNorman liked to have fish at least once a week, for his health. He had also found some nifty ways to prepare it now that he\u2019d been cooking at home more often. This week he had decided to saut\u00e9 a few scallops. He ordered six large scallops from the man behind the counter, double checking to ensure they were dry and not wet treated. \n\nThe fishmonger was always in a jolly mood that lifted Norman\u2019s spirits and wished him well as he packaged the scallops up in plastic. \n\nNorman continued past the bulk aisle and selected some barley, some cornmeal, and after a bit of consideration, some oatmeal. He quite liked the flavored instant oatmeal packets they sold down further in the snack aisle, but he knew this contained less sugar. \n\nNorman almost purchased some bulk walnuts to top his oatmeal, but remembered he still had some pecans at home, so continued on, bopping his head to the cheery instrumental playing over the loudspeakers. \n\nNext he arrived at the butcher area. He didn\u2019t need anything cut to order this week so picked out a box of chicken wings, with the gourmet hot sauce his brother generously sent for Christmas in mind.  \n\nHe picked up a few pork and beef meatballs and a big frozen lamb chop for later in the week. He figured he could pop it in the oven and cook it up without much fuss. \n\nThe train of thought was momentarily interrupted by a robotic voice breaking onto the PA system to encourage people to maintain social distance, but his list reoriented him. \n\nHe passed by the pasta, oil, and broths aisle and grabbed a box of bronze cut tagliatelle to enjoy with his nice meatballs, then a box of regular store brand penne for an average noodles and sauce night. He\u2019d been having more of those than he\u2019d care to admit now that his big project at work was really in full swing. \n\nThis aisle also contained vinegars, and he was running low on balsamic, which he often liked to use on salads. He chose a mid-range one with a pretty rose embossed on the bottle. \n\nHe saw a woman on the other side of the aisle he thought he might recognize from a previous job site, but he couldn\u2019t be quite sure due to how much time had passed, so didn\u2019t wave just in case he was mistaken. \n\nHe spotted a box of chicken stock he needed to have on hand for cooking, but looked a minute longer to locate the store brand, for which he had a coupon. \n\nHe didn\u2019t need anything from the baking aisle, but couldn\u2019t resist grabbing a package of Instant hot cocoa from the end cap. He quite enjoyed the little marshmallows in each package, and it had been unseasonably chilly lately. \n\nHe perused the snack foods and settled on a bag of sour cream and onion chips for this week, though he did enjoy last week\u2019s box of cheez-it\u2019s so much that he\u2019d purchased them twice in a row. However, he was resolute that it was time to switch things up. He placed the bag in his cart, careful not the crush the delicate morsels. \n\nNext Norman found himself in the dairy aisle. He waited a minute for it to empty out a bit, then picked up a jug of milk, a box of eggs, a block of mild cheddar cheese, and a few single-serving packages of cottage cheese. He decided to go for a jar of strawberry yogurt this week, as well. \n\nAs he passed the freezer section he treated himself to a box of fudgesicles. He nearly grabbed the lactose-free version by accident, so quickly swapped them back. \n\nHe still had plenty of bread so walked past the fresh bakery department and arrived at produce once more. \n\nHe picked out four apples, three red and one green. He carefully selected honey crisp apples without bruises, an especially difficult task now that it was considered poor form to touch the apples while inspecting them. \n\nHe purchased a head of broccoli, a bunch of asparagus, and a couple boxes of spinach. Butternut squash were on sale, buy one get one half off, so he opted for those instead of the sweet potatoes he had planned to purchase. \n\nThere weren\u2019t many exciting fruits and vegetables to procure during the winter so Norman looked forward to the first harvests of spring. \n\nHe considered looping back around to the baking aisle to grab a can of cooking spray he\u2019d forgotten he needed, but the handle to his cart was slightly loose, and the wiggling annoyed him too much to make another extended trip. \n\nNorman pushed towards the check out, controlling the wiggling as best he could. The shortest line placed him in the middle of the canned goods aisle. There were only about five people on this line, but they were spread far enough apart that it made the line appear longer than it actually was. \n\nAs Norman remembered his turn, he realized he needed a couple cans of green beans for a casserole. He also picked up a few packages of shelf stable tuna fish for the monthly food drive the store runs. \n\nHe got distracted trying to read the shirt of the person two carts ahead of him, something about a state championship but he still wasn\u2019t sure for what sort of competition, when before he knew it there was an open register. \n\nHe placed his items on the conveyor belt with due consideration, holding his eggs in reserve to be bagged last and being mindful not to accidentally bring the tuna home that he meant to leave in the food bank collections bin. \n\nHe made some light small talk with the checker, but it was a teenager girl, so Norman didn\u2019t have much to say that she found interesting and vice versa. \n\n\u201cLooks like it might snow.\u201d He mentioned. \u201cHuh?\u201d She replied. \u201cOutside. Kind of stormy. Might be a blizzard coming in.\u201d \u201cOh, sure. Maybe.\u201d She concurred, not looking up from her bagging. \u201cI\u2019ve been checking that weather app thing, but half the time it has no idea what it\u2019s talking about.\u201d Norman remarked. \u201cMmhmm.\u201d The check out girl replied. \n\nNorman realized he\u2019d left his reusable bags at home and was momentarily frustrated, but then remembered the store still had a temporary policy against them unless you used self checkout, which was out of order that day. He set his worries aside. \n\n\u201cThanks!\u201d Norman smiled to the checker as he pushed his full cart towards the exit. \u201cHappy new year!\u201d He added. \u201cHappy new year!\u201d She smiled back. \n\nNorman carefully positioned the cart outside his car to be sure it wouldn\u2019t roll away, and loaded the bags comfortably into his trunk. They fit just right so as not to be jostled on the drive home. \n\nHe closed the back and pushed his trolley into a carafe, ultimately glad he didn\u2019t park too far away from the store\u2019s entrance. He sat down in the driver\u2019s side and rubbed his hands to the wrist with Purell before pulling through the empty space in front of him and out into the street. \n\nHe arrived home, carried his bags indoors with a single trip, and promptly put everything away in it\u2019s proper place, beginning with his precious fudgsicles in the freezer and concluding with his hefty squashes at the far end of the counter. \n\nAfter washing his hands and changing his clothes from the trip, Norman bit into one of his crisp new apples with delight. He decided he had such a variety of delicious foods, it was time for Norman to enjoy some as well, so opened a fresh can of fish-medley flavored cat food for him from the treat pantry. Then, they both sat back, and enjoyed their tasty snacks.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1610764160.0,"comments":[{"author":"Das_Maechtig_Fuehrer","text":"As someone who works at a grocery store this is well written, i see people like this hundreds of times.","upvotes":21,"created_utc":1610768161.0},{"author":"postinganxiety","text":"This was so incredibly comforting.\n\nI love how you captured the grocery shopping train of thought that we all run...and yet are barely aware of since it\u2019s on autopilot.\n\nWell done!","upvotes":16,"created_utc":1610767439.0},{"author":"stressbaked","text":"This guy grocery shops.

He always enjoyed it but would certainly never purchase any for himself, so had to ration it sparingly. \n\nOnce squeaky clean and sufficiently scalded, Norman emerged, enjoying the burst of cool air and wiping a streak of condensation away from his mirror just enough to catch a glimpse of himself while he brushed his teeth, flossed, used his water pick, and rinsed with mouthwash. He wrapped a towel around himself as he took his nightly pill. \n\nHe pulled on a comfortable pair of oversized boxers and warm jogging pants with a worn cotton sweatshirt on top, hoping to lock in some of the remaining heat from the shower. The sweatshirt sported an elegant maroon and gold emblem of a college he hadn\u2019t gone to. \n\nHe still wasn\u2019t quite sure where he\u2019d gotten it or who might\u2019ve left it behind, but it was quite comfortable. \n\nAfter a few quick stretches his doctor recommended for a more peaceful sleep, Norman slipped under his freshly laundered covers, enjoying the smooth texture of the fabric softenered sheets against his clean, dry fingers and toes. \n\nHe blinked away a bit of exhaustion from the productive workday and hearty dinner, determined to get in a chapter of his excellent library book, *The Typist and His House Pets*, a period novel. He always liked to excitedly point out to Norman whenever a cat was the center of the story. \n\nHe read about fifteen of the twenty pages in the chapter before flipping to see how much he had left, because his eyelids were growing pleasantly heavy. Seeing he had fewer than ten pages, he decided to finish the chapter, and was glad he did because a tense situation resolved with a happy ending. \n\nHe shut the book with his grey tasseled bookmark, pleased to drift to sleep on such an upbeat note. By that point, Norman had clambered up to cuddle by his feet, as well. \n\nHe wrapped his arms around a stray pillow that had fallen to his side and swirled his legs around in the sheets, enjoying the modest but fulfilling life he had made for himself to the fullest extent, as he drifted into a dream as sweet as perfume.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1610520668.0,"comments":[{"author":"FusiformFiddle","text":"It's like a bedtime story for adults!

The royal blue matches his eyes, yet the navy blue matches his socks. The dark blue didn't match anything, yet would that make it stand out? He began to place the dark blue tie around the collar when an idea struck, 'Maybe I could wear no tie whatsoever' he thought. \n\nSurely he couldn't?

Did Norman try to splurge on a more exciting brand and just decide that it wasn't worth the hype or possibility that Martha from work, who is quite succeptible to getting irritated with \"strong scents\", might decide she is sensitive to that smell.

And on the other side of it stood a delivery man. The delivery man was tall, had short black hair, and wore the typical uniform of the delivery service of that area. A short sleeve brown shirt with two buttons near the neck, a pair of brown pants, and black shoes that both looked nice and were fit for running in.\n\n\"Here is you delivery.\" The delivery man said. \"Please sign here.\"\n\nHe handed Norman a clipboard with a piece of paper on it. Norman signed the paper.\n\n\"Thank you.\" Said Norman. \n\nNorman took the package and closed the door.\n\nHe took the package into his living room and set it on the floor. Norman took his keys and sliced the tape so he could open the package. \n\nInside was a shoebox. Norman thought, \"Oh my! It is a pair of shoes.\"\n\nNorman opened the shoebox, and inside was a brand new pair of light brown loafers. \"And not only that, there's a pair of socks, as well.\" Underneath the loafers, was a pair of black socks.\n\n\"What a wonderful gift.\" Thought Norman.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1609039664.0,"comments":[{"author":"lil-seany","text":"What a wonderful gift","upvotes":21,"created_utc":1609045326.0},{"author":"srslywatstheinternet","text":"Norman would love this gift but I have trouble believing he would use his keys to open the box.

The radio chattered its ads but the low volume and rain was soothing in an odd way. While the windshield wipers smeared the glass, only pretended to do their jobs, Norman debated between grabbing some fast food or going straight home. Norman was hoping there were left-overs he could convince himself were still appetizing, but didn't expect to find much.\n\nHe did a brief mental calculation noting that he had jalapeno chips, a salad, and a coke zero in the cafeteria today. He did the math and decided to make a compromise. \n\nNorman's conscience bought him a chicken sandwich because of his healthy cafeteria choices today - a deliberate choice made only to allow the inevitable post-work dietary cheat less shameful. Pairing that with at least one thing from the fridge would now allow him to enjoy it in peace. \n\nNorman set his to-go bag on a tv tray that was still out from the previous night, and eventually decided on tomato basil soup as his side dish. Sitting down with TV remote and spoon akimbo, Norman agreed with himself that the discovery channel - probably How It's Made or Dirty Jobs - would be fitting. Norman knew that leaving a TV tray out and using the same napkin as last night was kind of a *slob move* and didn't want to add to the couch-potato look he had going. Some good ol' fashion semi-educational television should do just the trick to not let him enjoy himself too much.  \n\nWrapping up his crumbs neatly in the plastic and setting the empty bowl in the sink, he cracked his thumb joints and made for the bedroom. Suddenly, there came a sound like something tapping a wall from the living room. His heart raced as he  surveyed the area waiting for something to jump out. \n\nNorman shook his head realizing no one ever grew out of that stage of being scared of weird house noises. People who never acted scared just hid it well, but Norman was never any good at that. His elbows and knees sweat too much when he was nervous and it always gave him away. \n\nNorman performed his nightly ritual of brushing his teeth, drinking a glass of ice water to \"build character,\" and reminding himself to floss tomorrow after inevitably slipped his mind once he was already in bed. \n\nIt was a night, neither good nor bad, but Norman realized it was one he was probably going to forget. Nothing notable happened and he liked that sort of thing. \n\n\"Like,\" is a strong word that might even mean something notable happened. But that could not be, for Norman was a conisuerrier of the mundane, an aesthete of the normal. Norman was a person who took life by the horns of the prosaic and went where it took him. Never too much, or too little. Never too wide, or too thin. Never too loud, or too soft. \n\nNorman rolled over to his left side in agreement, but somewhere deep in his subconscious there was a problem. Norman was not the man he thought he was. He was not the well-rounded man he so casually strived to be. There was something - something hidden deep within the near surface of his mind. \n\nThere it was - taking shape slowly - making itself known to him. Norman strained lightly in his attempt at self-analysis rolling now to his right side. \n\nAh. He figured it out. The ecstacy of enlightenment washed over him - or it would have if he was into that sort of thing.\n\nBut rather, he rolled onto his back as a punctuation of finality realizing:\n\nNorman thought too much.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1608448452.0,"comments":[{"author":"llamaparts","text":"Poetry","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1608448767.0},{"author":"mosesman86","text":"I love it!","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1608482574.0},{"author":"aprilgrass","text":"This is beautiful","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1608511645.0},{"author":"ogresaregoodpeople","text":"Really enjoyed this one.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1612072109.0}]},{"title":"Goodnight Norman","author":"ligamentary","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/kbl4dm\/goodnight_norman\/","text":"Norman unwrapped the butterfinger candy bar he\u2019d been saving for the end of the week when he paid for his gas at the fill-up station. \n\nHe took a satisfying, crunchy, bite and turned on  the local news. He watched a few minutes before flipping channels through a couple infomercials, a telenovela, and an old Bruce Lee movie, before finally settling on a documentary about South American river markets. \n\nHe watched it until the ad break, wiping the candy crumbs off his shirt into the wastebasket, and turned to his favorite sports talk show that was just beginning as he cleaned up from dinner. \n\nHe emptied his small recycling into his larger recycling and took his indoor trash to his outdoor trash. He refreshed Norman\u2019s litter. He did a bit of vacuuming. But then the show ended and he lost motivation for any further housework. \n\nHe knew the end of the show signaled that it was getting fairly late, so he shut the pet door and trailed off to the bedroom. \n\nHe grabbed a quick, hot, shower. He brushed his teeth, flossed, used his water pick, rinsed with mouthwash, and took his nightly pill. \n\nHe put on a fresh white t-shirt and loose, well worn, cotton pajama bottoms. \n\nHe had a brief phone call with his mom, whom he\u2019d been making a point to speak with more often during the pandemic, and climbed into bed. \n\nHe had been happy to hear his mom\u2019s garden plants had transitioned indoors well for the winter. \n\nHe had two books on his nightstand to choose from. One was a factual accounting of the history of steam engines, the other was a mystery story about a rogue government agent in the South of France. \n\nHe decided the mystery was too much excitement for just before bed, and read a half a chapter about the steam engines before his eyes began to feel heavy and his arms began to shudder against the *whir* of his heating unit. \n\nHe placed his gold fringe bookmark between the pages and nestled under the covers with Norman dutifully perched at his feet.

Luckily for Norman, he enjoyed lines. After Norman received his coffee, he realized the cup was too hot to hold. *I should ask for a second cup so I can hold it easier,* thought Norman.\n\nThe line continued to grow and the baristas seemed rather busy. Norman debated whether he should wait in line again just for a cup, or if he should try to wave down a barista. Norman needed to get back to work soon, so he approached a vacant section of the counter and got a barista's attention.\n\n\"Can I get a second cup please?\" Norman asked. The large crowd and the whirring coffee machinery made it very difficult to hear. The barista looked puzzled. \"I don't know if we have that,\" the barista hollered over the noise. Now Norman looked confused. \n\n\"Let me go check,\" said the barista, as he hurried into the back. After a moment the barista came out with a cup of chocolate milk and handed it to Norman, then quickly turned around to work an espresso machine. Norman held the cup with a perplexed look. He knew the barista misheard him, but also didn't want to interrupt the clearly stressed employees any more than he already had.\n\nAs Norman began walking back to the office, two drinks in hand, he poured the chocolate milk out of the cup and inserted the cup of coffee into the empty cup.

He had spent quite a while looking through catalog after catalog, van after van, until he had decided that he had no idea what he was doing, decided to leave the job up to Norman.\n\nNorman's paw hit a peculiar spot between a coastline and the burger shop a few minutes away from Norman's house, which wasn't actually a destination, but rather an ad. Nonetheless, Norman decided he wanted to go to the coastline while picking up.. Maybe a few burgers for the road along the way.\n\nNext; he needed to figure out his mode of transportation. Should he splurge for a fancy RV, the type he saw on those television shows when CSI wasn't playing and nothing else could suit him about happy families going on happy road trips? Or would his car, a little or a lot old, depending on how you saw it, have to suit the trip?\n\nNorman decided the prudent thing would be to just drive his car. He didn't know if he could afford to waste any money, especially if he wanted to pay that lovely fellow who promised to give him signed DVDs of CSI. There would be no way he could give that man that sum of money, plus his credit card info and sign a long contract. He'd just have to use his car.\n\nAfter much planning and meticulous packing, Norman along with Norman put everything in the trunk and began to drive, only for his car to break in the middle of the driveway. His plan was ruined.\n\nThe only positive bit was that instead of spending his night on the road, he got to spend it in a blanket with Norman, a bowl of ice cream, and CSI.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1605655551.0,"comments":[{"author":"Dotcor_Strangelove","text":"I like the idea of Norman on the road.

As he had got older, Norman had noticed that he had to take better care of his eyebrows, as they were far more likely to grow out of the of control than when he was a younger man. \n\nThe first thing he had to figure out was how he could reasonably do this himself. He had an electric razor, which he used with regularity ever since he abandoned wet shaving 2 years and 3 months ago (he remembered as it had been a particularly painful experience around Thanksgiving). However, he did not trust himself enough to use this razor on his eyebrows, as he feared he may take them cleanly off, and would look fairly ridiculous.\n\nLooking around the house, he found a pair of small nail scissors, and decided this would be the best option for him, as he could have a more focused and targeted attack on the overlong hair strands that hung down over his eyes. However, before raising the scissors to his face, the voice of great aunt Norma came to his mind \u201cNever put anything smaller than your eye up to your eyes\u201d (She would accompany this statement by putting her hand over her eye, pretending to be a one eyed Pirate, before cackling and pinching young Norman\u2019s cheek). Not wanting to end up in A&E with a scratched eyeball, Norman realised that he would require the help of a professional.\n\nPutting his coat on, Norman left the house and walked down to his barbershop, wondering to himself how he could ask for just his eyebrows to be trimmed. He didn\u2019t need a haircut, and the idea of what he would be asking seemed peculiar in the extreme (\u201cwhat would they charge for this\u201d he asked himself).\n\nArriving at the barbershop, he saw 4 men waiting for a haircut. He felt conflicted, as his job would take a matter of minutes, whereas they would take far longer. He also felt that he may be laughed out of the shop for this request.\n\nStanding outside for a good 10 minutes, wondering what to do, the barber stuck his head around the door: \u201coh hey pal, can I help you?\u201d. Norman replied \u201cno thanks\u201d. The barber said \u201coh, ok then. No worries\u201d and returned to his job.\n\nNorman would try again tomorrow.

The hot pockets were too cold, but he was too depressed thinking about his ex to care. Tonight was a night just like all the others. His cat, just like usual, was drooling, problaby thinking of eating something big, with two arms and two legs, and with a brain the size of a biscuit. Couldn't have a better friend than this little feline. Watching CNN, Norman started to feel quite fuzy. He took a glass of water, and fell from the 30th floor unto the parking lot.\n\n\"Shooop palooop! We or doncing in o loop!\" Said something behind him. The creature began screaming in agony, while streching it's muscles. The muscular sheep was indeed something incredible.  Norman felt quite uncomfortable, but he simply couldn't wake up.  The sheeps' brothers seemed lost, eating their own eyes. Then, the king of this madness came, with tired eyes and a frown. The king was a wolf, who strangely became the ruler of sheeps. Norman's theory was that this was exactly just like the invasion of england by the french. The dialect of the king was very distinct from the rest of the tribe. While the sheep people liked to spell \"o\" a lot, the king actually spelled his letters like a normal person. He put some grass and other wacky things on top of Norman's bald head, and on his enormous belly because for them it was a sign of weakness. They weren't wrong, Norman wasn't the toughest speciemen. Confused, he decided to join the cult.\n\n30 minutes after their encounter, the muscular sheep people accepted him like one of their own. As a gift, the clan decided to go on a hunt with him. Norman didn't understand, as he never saw them eat anything. Turns out, the muscular herbivores ate carbon dioxide. The human was really touched by their offer. He quickly deserted the clan, as he was peacefully injured, insulted and excommunicated by the sad king.\n\nTraumatized, Norman took refuge againts the sheep people, and discovered a new clan, the nice gang,  serial killer wolves, who weren't nice at all, not even a little bit. Their feet smelled like feces, and they knew it very well. They had feet fetishes in fact. At the first sight of Norman, the wolf gang became extremely triggered, and ran at him with the strengh of a pregnant woman. When they catch their pray, they begin rubbing gently the victim's beautiful feet. They were nourished by the insects between the thumb and the index of each individual. They had quite refined taste in good cuisine, as they made chunky soup, which kinda looked like somebody put some crap on jell-o.  Inside the chunky soup lived thousands of mouth-eye people, flurishing and prospering in their crappy condition. \"The king, while way more successful than the nice gang, regretted no longer being able to taste such good food.\" told me the chief of the nice gang. Norman thought to himself that he didn't need to be successfull to be happy, because those little mouth-people inside the crap didn't seem to care that much.\n\nLesson of the story: don't watch cnn too much","upvote_ratio":0.62,"created_utc":1601942895.0,"comments":[{"author":"N173M4R3Z","text":"I love this","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1602916358.0},{"author":"Justinhuman","text":"This is cringe I'm dying","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1612490184.0}]},{"title":"Norman overslept on a Saturday","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/j4sum4\/norman_overslept_on_a_saturday\/","text":"Norman woke up feeling something warm and heavy on his stomach.

Norman still wasn't sure what this show was really about, aside from the fact that they performed once a month, and that it was in a warehouse.\n\n\"It's a theatre piece, Norman. It's kind of hard to describe, it's a feeling piece more than a straight narrative. If you walked away from this and felt nothing I'd understand, it's strange. I'll try my best to describe it for you... You know that feeling you get when you see a stranger on the sidewalk, and the realization that they're a living person, with their own goals, habits, people to love of their own? It's a show about that, allowing the voyeur the chance to watch people in their environments, untouched. There's a small narrative in each show, some characters will interact with each other, others will break the fourth wall. The story is the same each month, but the actors get to decide the inner feelings of their character, of where they are at that time. That's what makes it interesting to go back every month, to see these characters not evolve along a plot, but just to see them grow, be themselves. This might be the only show you go to, but try and keep an open mind, okay?\"\n\n\"What's Junior's character going to be?\"\n\n\"That's gonna be something you'll find out soon enough.\"\n\nThe space was in the back of a tall rusty building with many boarded off doors. Gracie lead the way through the building, entering the one door with a welcome mat. It was a great change in quality- the spacious interior of the warehouse was built to look a little like a TV show studio set. Dozens three walled cubicle shaped sets, all wrapped around to an almost closed off circle, the large space in the center full of seats and places to stand for the audience. Each cubicle was quite different- one was designed to look like a bus stop. Another, a kitchen table and china cabinet. Another, a bedroom. Each had their own small story to tell, a stage for a single act. Gracie and Norman stood in the circle, busily chatting with the other young folk, and not long after did the circle become so full that Norman had a hard time finding someplace to stand. Norman noticed Howard, Junior's professor. They shook hands and talked quietly, until the show was ready to begin.\n\nThe crowd hushed. Out from the side, twenty performers walked in a line, and one by one, entered their respective cubicles, their own slices of life. Norman saw Junior. He was dressed in a shirt and tie, his sleeves rolled up, his face tired. Norman never saw Junior act before, and it was interesting to see him in such a disgruntled state, even if it were fake. Junior stepped into a living room set, a small stove in the back of his room.\n\nThe crowd went silent as the twenty acts started to play out. Some made no noise at all, like the woman dressed as an elderly woman, saying her night prayer at the end of her bed. Others, like the couple in the bedroom, were having a small fight about passive aggression and how it doesn't exist. A \"homeless\" man sat outside of the sets, leaned up against a board, directly asking the audience for spare change. Norman pulled out a dollar and handed it to the homeless man. He said thank you, and went on his way. Another two people walked around the circle, as if they were going for a late night stroll and having small talk about their lives. It was a little overwhelming for Norman, so many stories playing out all at once, but there was a small bit of harmony in the chaos that was happening. Soon he found out how to tune in and channel out the rest of the noise, and focus on one show at a time. His attention would be brought back to Junior, the quietest of all the shows.\n\nJunior played an older man with a bad back, pacing in the living room and kitchen of his home, taking small moments to stir the pot of food he was cooking, and wandering back to the television set. In between each meandering trip, the man would stop by the phone, his full attention turned to it, as if it would ring any second. At one point, the phone does ring- the character quickly dropping the remote, turning to the phone and picking it up- excited- only to have that feeling disappear soon after. \"No thank you, have a good night,\" said Junior. He took a seat in the chair, ate his meal, and his character stayed there for the rest of the show. Most of the acts, as far as Norman was concerned, didn't mean a whole lot to him. They were lives he couldn't relate to, too distracted by the performances trying to lead him to learn a completely new person. But Junior was familiar, a situation he could relate with. Norman doesn't know if he'll ever fully understand his son, or that lifestyle. But perhaps that was okay.\n\nAfter the show ended, Norman and Gracie met Junior in the back stage area, all the actors now disbanding from their personas. The homeless-man tucked the dollar back in Norman's shirt pocket, patting him on the shoulder.\n\n\"Hey Norm!\" said Gracie, wrapping her arm around Junior. \"You did great tonight. Your father's here.\" Junior seemed shocked, embarrassed seeing his dad standing just a few feet away.\n\n\"Hey, Junior.\" said Norman. \"You did... That was great, Junior, really. I didn't get all of it, but I liked it.\"\n\nJunior nodded shyly, scratching the back of his neck.\n\n\"It was great, Junior. I'm proud of you.\"\n\nJunior, eyes still glued to the ground, took a step forward and hugged Norman. \"Thanks dad, it means a lot. Thank you.\"\n\nLater on that evening, the three of them headed back to the apartment. They had one last coffee before Norman readied himself to drive home. Gracie packed up a box of treats for Norman and his trip, and Junior stood and chatted with Norman one last time before driving away.\n\n\"It wasn't such a bad trip, huh?\" asked Junior.\n\n\"No, it wasn't. I'm glad I came. I know that things can be a little difficult between us... But that's okay. One step at a time.\"\n\n\"Hey, I'll be right back. One second.\" Junior ran back into the apartment. Gracie placed the bag of treats in the car, and walked past Norman, saying her goodbyes.\n\n\"Hey, thanks Gracie, for everything. I don't know what I would've done without your nudge.\"\n\n\"No worries, Norm. Just glad to help. See you again, someday!\" Gracie gave him a hug and left, Junior returning from indoors, a camera in hand.\n\n\"Can I take your photo, dad? In front of the car?\"\n\n\"Haha, yep, yes you can.\"\n\nNorman stood in front of the Daihatsu, placing his hand on the roof, as if he was standing in front of a trophy kill. Norman changed his expression a few times, before settling on a smile. Junior snapped the photo.\n\nNorman kept smiling as he drove out of the state. It was a strange trip with a lot of emotions for him, still processing how he felt about it all. Ultimately, he felt happy, proud of himself for stepping out of his bubble, and proud of Junior, for finding happy footing in a world of his own.\n\nNorman spent the night in the same motel with great cable, before arriving home the day after that, late in the evening, parking the exhausted car and stepping up his front steps. The apartment was quiet- a slight smell of cat pee, as well as a very excited cat. Norman scooped up his cat and gave her a loving snuggle, finding a cold can of salmon in the cabinet. After cooking dinner and finding something to watch, Norman got a call from Junior, seeing if he made it home safely.\n\n\"G'night dad. Love you.\"\n\n\"Love you too, Junior. G'night.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 41: Norman is Back](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/loyild\/norman_is_back_norman_part_41\/)","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1600532984.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"New York, Day Four (Norman, Part 39)","author":"MattressCrane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/iuih16\/new_york_day_four_norman_part_39\/","text":">[Click here for part 38!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/itukwu\/new_york_day_three_norman_part_38\/)  \n>  \n>[Click here to go to the beginning!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hsvfbm\/boy_meets_girl_norman_part_1\/)\n\nNorman knew he looked through to the past with rose tinted glasses. He missed the old days, of Junior being small adventurous boy who liked to play in the backyard with his dad; of the Suzanne that was happy and spontaneous and loved Norman back. He knew there were those moments of falter, of him blindly looking positively at the past, though some of those moments took Norman many years to realize. He regrets adopting the cat without talking to Suzanne first. He regrets telling Junior to \"snap out of it\" when mentioning his desire to live far away and travel; that he should recognize that home is where he belonged. It was small memories, repressed to the point of them being almost completely forgotten, but the ripple effect was there, catching up and shaking Norman's world here and then when he'd choose to acknowledge them. This was one of those times.\n\nNorman regretted coming on this trip. It was well intended, sure, but poorly planned. Perhaps Junior was right, and that Norman should stop being so stubborn in his old ways and open up. Norman felt like he would be lying to himself though if he felt that this was a world he wanted to be a part of, and with Junior feeling the same about Norman's life, he didn't know what else was there to discuss. New York was alienating to him, the farthest thing from his way of life. He wanted to go home, to return to his empty apartment and his cubicle, and clock in the days the way he knew how. He decided he would be heading home early, taking off this morning in time to finish off the trip and be in bed by sundown.\n\nFirst he had to say his goodbyes to his son. He was going to keep it brief, a goodbye at the door, unless Junior wanted to stop for coffee first. Norman didn't care which it was, at this point he just felt embarrassed, willing to concede defeat and try to reconnect with his son on a different occasion, on a different year.\n\nGracie answered the door. Still a little shocked at the start, her demeanor changed, soon looking  glad to see Norman.\n\n\"How're you, Norman!\" she asked, \"Junior's not home at the moment, by the way, in case you were looking for him.\"\n\n\"Ah, that I was. I'm good! I was just leaving the city, actually.\"\n\n\"I thought you were leaving tomorrow?\"\n\nNorman kicked the gravel at his feet. \"I was, but y'know, some work issues came up. And my cat's running out of food, so I figured I'd get a head start on those.\"\n\nGracie nodded, saddened at the answer. \"Would you like to come in for a coffee?\"\n\n\"That's okay.\"\n\n\"Do you prefer salami or ham?\"\n\n\"Ham.\"\n\nA moment later Gracie was fixing Norman a coffee and a sandwich, ham with mayo and mustard, though she added some greens that looked like grass, but Norman didn't mind the change in texture.\n\nNorman never made it to sitting in Junior's place, only being toured the porch on that first visit. It was a pretty kitchen, small and cluttered, but warm with the sun beaming in and plants hanging from the ceiling. Photographs were on wall, pictures reminiscent of Norman Rockwell paintings. Slices of life, people posed in their environments.\n\n\"Y'know Junior took all those photographs? He's getting very good at it.\"\n\n\"I didn't! I didn't know that Junior even took photos.\"\n\n\"He loves it. He's a mixed bag of artist, always changing. Writing never clicked with him unfortunately, but he likes to take photos, and act. I think he imagines them being one in the same. He likes the small aspects in life, to appreciate the day to day for the small things they bring.\" Gracie points to a photo of an arm covered in goosebumps, poised in front of a summer field. A photo of a man handing over a slice of pizza over a counter, smiling to the patron. A mother admiring her new son. \"I think he loves that aspect of life, even if he doesn't want to live it himself. It's as if he's trying to capture those moments, trying to remember them for what they are.\"\n\n\"Mhmm,\" said Norman. He always struggled to understand art, or anything more than a straightforward plot in a film. But with how Gracie described the photos to him, it made Norman a little more appreciative looking at them, a small understanding of what his son was looking for, and now being a little more open to seeing what he wanted to see, with the frustrating vagueness out of the way. He recognized one of the photos, a photo of the cat posed in his apartment. Norman didn't know when that even took place, perhaps at a Christmas visit, years ago.\n\n\"Are you going to be leaving town before Junior's show?\"\n\n\"Uh, I think so. I don't know what the show is, honestly.\"\n\n\"I think you should come! It'll be worth it, trust me. You can come with me if you like.\"\n\n\"Ah, I'm not sure...\"\n\nGracie took a step forward, placing a hand on Norman's shoulder, looking him deeply in the eye.\n\n\"Listen Norm'. You should say goodbye to your son before you go, and you should support him too. If you come with me, I promise I'll handle all the awkward art talk. I'll snap my fingers too, so you don't have to.\"\n\nNorman paused, averting his eyes from Gracie. She stood there and waited for Norman to look back at her, a warm smile waiting for him.\n\n\"Is everyone going to be snapping their fingers?\" asked Norman.\n\n\"God no. I'm kidding. Alrighty, come on Mr. Crumb, are you in or are you out?\"\n\n# [Part 40](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/ivvq6z\/new_york_i_love_you_norman_part_40\/): New York, I Love You","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1600345797.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Norman's secret talent.","author":"Hereiampostingagain","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/itx5vr\/normans_secret_talent\/","text":"Norman was at the office one day when he decided he was thirsty.

He wanted to show Norman what he did on a normal day, and figured that's best by just going about his day as he normally went about it.\n\nThe trip started with Junior leading him a few blocks down the street; a quiet enough lane with large trees on the side, a small hole in the wall noodle house stationed right beside the subway. Heading underground, Junior bought a pair of tickets and handed one to Norman. Immediately Norman started to feel overwhelmed with the bustle of the city; the hundred people gathered on the small platform, careful not to be bumped onto the tracks like a penguin on the edge of a cliff. A train came roaring by, everyone boarding within seconds, and a few stops later on the shaky train, Junior was leading them off.\n\nThe first stop was to the campus grounds of the university that Junior was attending. It was an arts school, a quiet stone and brick assortment of buildings, on the outskirts of the city. Young people sat in the grass reading books and playing music, some of them knowing Junior, waving hello as he walked past. Junior pointed out the buildings that he frequented- the theatre hall where he practices acting, and the library, where he sits and reads or rents out the cameras he uses for his photography classes. Norman commented on the trees, wondering if they're watered regularly or if they're feeding off the pipes underground. Junior shrugged.\n\nJunior introduced Norman to one of his professors, an older gentleman named Howard. Norman found it funny that he was on a first name basis with a teacher, no mention of his last name in the introductions.\n\n\"Nice to meet you, Norman Senior,\" said Howard. He stuck his hand out for a shake.\n\n\"My dad's visiting the city for the next few days, coming to see what it's like to live in the big apple.\"\n\n\"Is he coming to your show?\"\n\n\"Ah, well, I don't know if that would be his thing. Are you into performance art, dad?\" Junior and Howard turned to Norman. They looked comfortable talking to each other, as if they were torn from the same cloth.\n\n\"Ah, unless you mean something like Circus du Soliel. I saw them on television a few weeks ago- spectacular!\"\n\nHoward laughed, a modest and warm chuckle. \"They are certainly good at what they do. Well I'll let you to be for now, I'll see you on Friday, Norman. You two have a good evening!\"\n\nThey continued on their journey, heading right back to the same train station and heading back towards downtown, into Manhattan, disembarking near Central Park. By this point in the day however, they'd been walking for hours, hours more than Norman was prepared to walk for. Central Park was lovely, long stretches of cobblestones and benches, benches Norman desperately wanted to sit on.\n\n\"I was thinking after this, you want to head to an art gallery? I had a friend who actually had a piece get into a show, it's a big deal for them. I was planning on stopping by, if you want to...\"\n\nNorman was more worried about his feet, but agreed anyways, despite lacking any interest in doing so.\n\nReaching the art gallery reminded Norman more of a small cafe than a grand white building he was imagining. Long halls, creaky wooden floorboards, and some self serve tables for coffee. Norman felt uncomfortable with whispering in the silence, only a few others wandering around and viewing the art too. So far, each piece felt alienating to Norman- abstract shapes, off putting environments, or people in positions staring somewhere he couldn't put his finger on. It reminded him of all the high art he joked about never understanding, and in that sense, meaning nothing. Some he held back his laughter, with how odd they looked.\n\n\"Do you see anything you like?\" asked Junior.\n\n\"Mhmm. I'm not sure. None of these make sense to me.\"\n\nNorman stopped in front a piece. It was a landscape painted blue, a lack of people, just objects scattered around.\n\n\"Like this one. Is there anything going on? It's just... A confusing mess. Pretending to be smart, but are they saying anything?\"\n\n\"Maybe they're just saying something you don't understand.\"\n\n\"Maybe they're just making it all up as they go!\" Norman went to prod Junior, but he walked ahead too quickly.\n\nAn hour later, they were finally done with the art show, heading back to the sidewalk.\n\n\"Phew!\" said Norman.\n\n\"You know, you could put a little effort into trying to enjoy the things that I do. You did nothing but complain about stuff. At least I tried yesterday to enjoy what you planned out, you didn't put the slightest consideration into doing the same for me.\"\n\n\"You didn't like yesterday?\"\n\n\"No, I guess not. It's not me anymore, dad, I'm sorry. Don't just take that as a personal attack, try to at least understand that I can like different things now. I've changed, I'm not ten years old anymore.\"\n\nNorman was stunned, unsure of how to respond. His natural response was always to joke or stay quiet, but he knew Junior wouldn't be satisfied with just that, not now.\n\n\"I'm old, Junior. You have to understand that sometimes, y'know, stubborn old men like me don't like that sort of stuff. It's just out of my ball house. I like long drives and TV, I hope you can understand that there's just some aspects of your parents that isn't going to budge.\"\n\n\"So that's it? Too bad? I just have to accept that you'll never try and like my life, but I have to suck it up and put up with yours?\"\n\n\"Hey now, I didn't mean that.\"\n\n\"What did you mean, then?\"\n\nJunior waited for a response. Norman's heart was racing, the frog returning, he wished the moment would just get it over with and move onto the next.\n\n# [Part 39: New York, Day Four](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/iuih16\/new_york_day_four_norman_part_39\/)","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1600259738.0,"comments":[{"author":"aftermine1","text":"this dynamic between them is getting good!!","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1600334340.0}]},{"title":"Norman finds inspiration","author":"RokanPohan","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/itxtkb\/norman_finds_inspiration\/","text":"Norman was sat on one of three cheap folding chairs scattered about his small lawn.

Had he been feeling more spirited, Norman might have tried calling her over. *Psspsspss*, he thought, even as he stayed silent.\n\nAfter a time, as if having deemed Norman and his garden to be sufficiently harmless, the tabby rose, strolled lazily across the grass, and hopped onto an adjacent chair where she lay with her head raised for a moment.

He was all caught up on virtual work and had run his most pressing errands earlier in the week. \n\nHe considered a program about antelopes on the nature channel. Another good choice was a soap opera about rich teenagers attending rival high schools. There was also an infomercial for a shoe shine kit or a daytime talk show host cooking omelets with C list actors. \n\nFinally, he settled on the weather channel. He was comforted to hear the rain would let up soon and give way to a temperate breeze. \n\nJust as the show cut to commercial, Norman\u2019s work phone began to vibrate. He wasn\u2019t obligated to answer after 5:00pm, but this client had always been kind to him and his staff, so Norman didn\u2019t mind going out of the way. \n\nHe muted the television just as an over-enthusiastic announcer in a brightly colored shirt began screeching about some revolutionary new kitchen sponge, and answered, \u201cHello, Norman speaking.\u201d He gently shushed Norman, who swished between his legs with a plaintive *meow* begging for early supper, and moved further from the windows so as not to be drowned out by the pitter-patter of rain on glass. \n\n\u201cNorm, so glad I caught you.

He looked online for suggestions- museums, art galleries and long walks were not really his thing- and tried to find things that he knew he would enjoy, as well as Junior.\n\nAround noon that day Norman showed up back at Juniors, honking his horn lightly as Junior came down the sloped staircase.\n\n\"Honk honk! Burning daylight!\" joked Norman. He added in another real honk to finish off the joke. Junior stepped into the Daihatsu, taking it all in.\n\n\"Wow! Never thought I would be riding in this car again. What happened? You bought it back, eh?\"\n\n\"Yup! Jim's been taking good care of it these past few years, thankfully. Bought it back to come on this trip!\"\n\nNorman Junior paused, feeling some of that pressure of a good trip weighing on him already. Norman drove off and began their adventure.\n\nNever one to see New York in full, Norman gave Junior and himself a riding tour of the city, taking in the small scattered neighborhoods and a tour through Manhattan. Junior had to stop Norman from rolling down the window and asking people, \"Where's the pizza!?\" as a joke, saying that it was a little offensive to make fun of that stereotype to people's faces. It ultimately led to them having pizza for lunch, a nice little chain that Norman scouted out the night before.\n\n\"So, how'd you meet Gracie?\" asked Norman, as he used his straw to break apart a cluster of ice in his soda.\n\n\"It was a couple years ago now. We were in the same writing program back when I first went to college, but that didn't work out, as you know. It was around the time I was deciding to come to New York and she was too, so we became roommates... And then eventually a little more than roommates. Sorry I never told you about her, I know, I should've. And I didn't tell her that I didn't tell you about her either, so that's also a conversation I should've had.\"\n\n\"It's okay, Junior.\"\n\n\"... It's going well though. I think you'd like her, if you got to know her. She's real sweet.\"\n\nNorman nodded, busying himself chewing pizza. \"So... Anything going on in your life?\"\n\nNorman shook his head, stating that business was business as usual. It took Norman a moment later to regret pushing away everything that's happened to him this past year. He knew it was all small stuff, sure, but it wasn't nothing, all small events that lead him to have the confidence to come and meet his son, this far out of his comfort zone. But he felt it was crumbling under pressure, the plan backfiring as he could feel his sons disinterest in the day they had planned together, as well as a distance when it came to personal questions. It seemed that Junior always had a quick joke to pass off and undermine any important detail. Like father like son, Norman thought.\n\nStruggling to keep the conversation going, Norman suggested that they have a nice evening and go out to the theatres, and see what the new superhero movie playing in theatres was. Norman was never big into superheroes- too unrealistic and unnecessary for him- but Junior used to love them, when he was a kid.\n\n\"Which one do you want to see?\" asked Junior. \"I haven't been keeping up to date.\"\n\nNorman shrugged, getting advice from the kiosk clerk for which was best.\n\nThree hours later, Junior and Norman left the theatre, yawning and full on popcorn.\n\n\"That was something,\" joked Norman. Junior nodded.\n\n\"Anyways, it's getting a little late. I should be heading home soon. You want to do something tomorrow too? I can show you around, give you a 'locals' perspective on the city.\"\n\nNorman happily agreed, though the thought scared him a little. Time was short, and part of him hoped him and his son would've been past this awkward first meeting phase of the trip, but it seemed to be still in full swing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 38: New York, Day Three](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/itukwu\/new_york_day_three_norman_part_38\/)","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1600107609.0,"comments":[{"author":"feedmejack93","text":"\"New York, day two\" is the least Norman sounding title ever.","upvotes":0,"created_utc":1600125505.0}]},{"title":"Norman builds a House","author":"uncommoncommoner","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/is6s6t\/norman_builds_a_house\/","text":"It had taken him a couple days to make the foundation settled.

Finally the roof was finished. Wiping sweat off his forehead, he leaned back and sighed. \n\n\"Hey there kiddo--are you finished?\" his father asked, popping his head into the boy's room.

A wave hit her, a realization.\n\n\"Oh! Are you- you're Norman Junior's dad?\" her demeanor changed, a little embarrassed.\n\n\"Yeah! Sorry, yes, that's me. I know it's a little unexpected of a visit. Are you Junior's roommate?\"\n\n\"Nope, I'm Gracie. Nice to finally meet you!\" Gracie put out her hand, shaking Norman's. Norman didn't know about Gracie- to be fair, he didn't remember any of the names of Junior's roommates. They always molded together in his mind, four other artists taking the form of someone he always imagined to look like Andy Warhol. Gracie was different from that; she had a very kind face, albeit a little stressed at the moment.\n\n\"Come on it! Norm! *Norm!\"* Gracie disappeared into the apartment, searching for Junior. Norman stepped into the place, a musty old building smell overwhelming him quickly, with a slight hint of burnt weed- though Norman's nose wasn't trained to recognize that smell. Standing in the narrow front hall, Norman took a pause to look at the pictures and paintings that covered the walls. Black and white photographs of the city and the people in it, as well as paintings of cats, fruits, mountains, and some that took no discernible shape at all.\n\nComing down a narrow flight of stairs was Norman Junior. It took his father a moment to recognize him, followed after a momentary shock, as if this wasn't the person he was expecting to meet. He looked different, a whole other person. The last time Norman saw Junior in person was two years ago; Junior usually taking off only the Christmas holidays to leave the city, and he would switch between visiting Norman or Suzanne. He looked a little thinner than two years before, a slight receding and thinning of his hair was kicking in too, something that happened to Norman at a similar age. What stood out most to Norman was that he couldn't recognize the boy he raised- only seeing the unfamiliar shell of the man that he became.\n\n\"Uh, wow! Hi dad,\" said Junior, awkwardly. He looked shocked, but at the same time embarrassed, equally averting his eyes from Norman as well as Gracie, standing a few steps up the stairwell behind him. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\nNorman wasn't sure how to respond, a nervous laugh taking the place of an answer.\n\n\"Oh ah, you know. I just thought I'd drop by, and, say hi... See the city! You know me, never getting out or travelling often. Thought now was as good of a time as any!\"\n\nJunior laughed. \"Well, I suppose that's true. I'm just a little surprised, is all. You're the last person I was expecting to knock on my door today.\"\n\nNorman shrugged. The two men remembered that they forgot to give each other a hug, making good and doing it before it became seemingly too late to gesture for one.\n\n\"Oh, well, I guess I should make some introductions... Dad, this is Gracie.\" Gracie waved politely. \"She's my girlfriend... We're living together.\"\n\n\"Oh! Nice to finally meet you!\" said Norman, waving once again to her. Norman never knew that Junior was seeing someone. It wasn't a topic they normally discussed- Norman always figured that it was a topic that would come up if Junior ever had anything to share. There was yet another awkward pause, no one knowing how to move forward.\n\nJunior cleared his throat, breaking lull. \"So, how long are you here for? Do you have a place to stay?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm having to be back by Sunday, so I don't leave the cat on her lonesome for too long, and work as well. Minus travel time, I have the next five days in the city!\"\n\n\"That's great! That's a big trip planned. What're you gonna do?\"\n\n\"Ah, I'm not sure. I was hoping to spend some time with you, of course. You know how rare it can be when we get a chance to see each other...\"\n\n\"No no, of course, naturally. Ah well dad I'd love to spend the next few days with you, but I'm a little busy and in the middle of a few things this week, stuff I can't exactly cancel last minute. But I have a lot of tomorrow and the day after that free, in the afternoons. Saturday I'll be free too.\"\n\n\"Well two days is plenty of time at least!\"\n\nNorman said goodbye for now, giving his son one last hug and agreeing to meet with him the following afternoon. As he climbed back into the Daihatsu and drove around to kill time, Norman felt sick to his stomach, a terrible uneasy feeling brewing inside.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 37: New York, Day Two](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/isqn29\/new_york_day_two_norman_part_37\/)","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1600004307.0,"comments":[{"author":"sixfourch","text":"Really looking forward to seeing how this plays out!","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1600026428.0}]},{"title":"Norman gets on an airplane for the first time.","author":"Hereiampostingagain","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/irzy37\/norman_gets_on_an_airplane_for_the_first_time\/","text":"Norman was nervous and excited at the same time, for this was the first time he would ever step foot on an airplane.

Norman knew very little about how Junior's been doing these past few years. The occasional phone call would come and go and Norman felt he learned little more than that New York is frequently raining, frequently sunny, and that Junior was often busy with class. The city Norman lived in was no small metropolis either, but he rarely ventured out of the out-skirted suburbs that his apartment and office buildings resided in. Over the years the idea of leaving his state and heading to Juniors always came as a fantasy, usually triggered after a viewing of *Planes, Trains, and Automobiles,* but he always imagined the highway and road trip it would take to get there. Luckily for him on this day, he still had a map outlining the roads and stops he would've taken, if he ever found himself in the position that he is in now.\n\nGrateful of his recent purchase of a new cat food dispenser he purchased online, Norman filled the feeder with a weeks worth of food, and set out a new tray of cat litter too. Packing a small suitcase of shirts and underwear, Norman quadruple checked he didn't leave the stove on, and turned on the radio as he stepped out the door, to give the cat some company during the time he would be gone.\n\nNorman had his plan ready- A day of driving, a stop in a motel for the evening, and then by the following afternoon, he should be in the city, right on Juniors doorstep. Then, there would be five days he could spend in the city before needing to turn around, so not to leave the cat alone for too long.\n\nFilling up his tank and picking up several bags of chips, Norman hit the highway, heading out of town and aiming along the plains, heading as the crow flies towards New York. Norman found that driving on a highway was a lot more intimidating than he remembered, the old tiny car struggling not to be sucked into the vortex of passing trucks, as well as how he was certain his vision for far distances had deteriorated since the last time he was behind the wheel. By the time he reached his first pit stop he was exhausted from the focus it took not to die on the road, cleaning the pool of nervous sweat he built up along the way as he stopped to buy another few bags of chips.\n\nCome evening, a well wearied Norman pulled into a small roadside motel, booking a room for one, one without a mini fridge, to fight the undeniable temptation he would've fallen for. The room had air conditioning and a TV that had more channels than he had on his own TV, and Norman thought that perhaps once the trip was over that he should stay in motels more often.\n\nAfter some complimentary scones and coffee from the motel, Norman said goodbye to the new concierge and headed back out on the road. It was an uneventful trip for the rest of the journey- the world's largest apple, nor the world's largest paperclip, were as impressive as they sounded to drive past- and Norman reached New York a little ways into the afternoon. He remembered Junior's address, after sending him parcels from time to time, and as he got closer, the frog in his throat became panicked too, swelling and croaking, Norman's heart racing uncontrollably.\n\n4305 was the address Norman was looking for, as he parked his car in front of 4303. Heading towards the front door of the triplex, Norman was having second doubts, whether all this was stepping a little too far, a little too quickly, and maybe he should call before just knocking on his sons door.\n\nNorman knocked on his sons door.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 36: New York, Day One](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/iryfu9\/new_york_day_one_norman_part_36\/)","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1599656755.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"The Daihatsu (Norman, Part 34)","author":"MattressCrane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/ioswcz\/the_daihatsu_norman_part_34\/","text":"[Click here for part 34!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/imf7ht\/small_steps_then_big_steps_norman_part_33\/)\n\n[Click here to go to the beginning!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hsvfbm\/boy_meets_girl_norman_part_1\/)\n\nA few minutes after five, Jim, the senior accountant who Norman sold his car to many years before, stepped out of the front door and headed towards the Daihatsu. Norman stood there waiting, his hand protectively holding onto the side mirror of the miniature sized motor vehicle.\n\n\"Hi Norman! Scuse me there.\" said Jim, gesturing towards the front door. Norman didn't move.\n\n\"I want to buy my car back, Jim.\" stated Norman. Jim looked to him, a little confused.\n\n\"Ah, well, okay. It's a little more beat up than when you've had it, unfortunately. And I've grown quite attached to it.\"\n\n\"Me too, Jim. This is my car. It's the only car I've ever had, and I'd like to buy it off of you, right now.\"\n\n\"Right now?\" asked Jim.\n\nNorman nodded.\n\n\"... Well I wouldn't sell it any less than six hundred. It might be worth less, sure, but I'm not looking to sell it anywho. And I still need to get home, Norm'! Could I sell it to ya in a week or two?\"\n\nNorman thought about that, how it was indeed a pretty large inconvenience for Jim to go without a car right on the spot. But the thought of postponing this mad idea of his, even a single day, was out of the question.\n\n\"I'll tell you what,\" started Norman, \"I'll give you eight hundred for the car. Six hundred for it, and two hundred for the inconvenience for the time being til you find another car. And I won't budge a single cent!\"\n\n\"Ah, I don't know...\"\n\n\"A thousand.\"\n\n\"I really should speak with Martha about this.\"\n\n\"Eleven hundred!\"\n\nJim stopped, looking Norman up and down, realizing how absurd this all was.\n\n\"Everything alright, Norman?\"\n\nNorman gripped the side window a little tighter.\n\n\"Ahmm...\" mumbled Jim, scratching his head. \"Alrighty Norman. You have yourself a deal!\"\n\nNorman wiped the clammy sweat off his hand, and gave Jim a firm handshake. Norman stepped across the street to a convenience store, withdrawing eleven hundred dollars, and handing it over to Jim.\n\n\"Now Norman, I'll just take a nine hundred off you. I don't know how much this car is worth to you, but it's certainly can't be worth that much.\"\n\nJim handed Norman back two hundred dollars, and Norman gave Jim a hug.\n\nNorman stepped back into his car, the first time in many years, taking the moment in. It felt a little different- Jim installed some beaded backrollers on the drivers chair, and Norman's feet felt a few inches too far away from the pedal. But it smelled the same, and with a little jiggle, the car came to life, a low moaning roar coming out of the front, as if to welcome Norman back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 35: On the Road](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/ipfinf\/on_the_road_norman_part_35\/)","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1599569182.0,"comments":[{"author":"WH25","text":"How bold of Norman!","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1599851762.0}]},{"title":"Norman helps a stranger.","author":"Hereiampostingagain","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/ioeduy\/norman_helps_a_stranger\/","text":"Norman was driving down a long stretch of highway one day.

He pulled over and approached the stranded vehicle.\n\nNorman offered to help in any way he could, to which the woman asked if he knew anything about cars.

It had been a few months since the two last spoke, and it was perhaps the first time in many years that Norman was the one doing the calling. He was nervous, sure, but felt good about the situation ahead of him. He wasn't Ernestine- he didn't lie to his son, and he wasn't bitter and intentionally shutting him out. He figured that since he harbored no outwardly difficult parental traps, things would go a little more smoothly for him.\n\n\"Hello?\" asked Junior, groggily answering the phone, as if he just woke up from a nap.\n\n\"Hi Junior, it's your dad!\"\n\n\"Oh uh, hi dad. Did something happen?\"\n\n\"No no, everything's dandy. Just thought I'd give you a ring, hear how you are doing.\"\n\n\"I'm good, good, just sleeping, a little. It's 7:30 here.

He was doing quite well, apparently, very busy between his studies and side gigs.\n\n\"Well maybe I'll buy the car back and come for a visit!\" teased Norman. \"That would be something.\"\n\nJunior laughed along with him. \"Yeah, haha. That *would* be something.\"\n\nThe laughter calmed down.\n\n\"Well anyways, I'll talk to ya later dad. Things have been crazy busy around here, so I need me some good sleep.\"\n\n\"Okie dokie! Good to hear from you, thanks for calling,\" Norman said instinctively.\n\n\"Talk to you later, dad.\"\n\nLater on in the evening laying in bed, Norman thought about whether he would consider the call a successful small step. Sure, it wasn't anything like Norman missing his sons wedding and ostracizing him for ten years, only to be reunited at an Olive Garden, but Norman knew that was a large feat to ask of his life. It was a small step in the right direction, but Norman wished that it could've been a large step, with all the effort and courage it felt that took to take.\n\nThe next day, as Norman finished up his shift of work, something unexpected happened. Packing up his briefcase to head home for the day, he placed it onto his desk,\n\nand in a split moment,\n\nHis wedding ring, [sitting on the corner of his desk for the last several years](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hzf9xb\/the_life_of_norman_norman_part_10\/), had finally been dethroned, stumbling off into the waste bin.\n\nIt seemed unreal, an accident that could never actually happen, despite telling himself a thousand times that the ring was sitting there for the sole purpose of being knocked into the trash. He didn't see it happen, only hearing the quiet metallic thud as the bond of metal met the tin waste can. He didn't know what day it would happen, and while he didn't expect it to happen now, it felt right.\n\nHe let it stay at the bottom of the waste bin, hidden and buried behind shredded paper.\n\nA chapter had finally closed in Norman's mind, a past self he could never let be. Perhaps the sentiment could've been taken as his way of letting go, to prove he was done with his past. But now, he knew it meant something else. There was room in his future now, the man of the past dead with no say of what his future needed to be. He was free to try something new.\n\n\"Goodnight, Frank.\" said Norman, \"I'll see ya in a few weeks.\"\n\n\"G'night Norman,\" said Frank, disinterested in whatever Norman was implying with that statement.

As the toaster began to glow, Norman prepared a small plate and a butter knife.\n\nThe toast suddenly popped up, giving Norman a slight startle. *I'll never get used to that,* Norman thought as he chuckled. Norman pulled the toast out of the toaster, a perfect golden-brown, when he came to the sudden realization that he had no room-temperature butter to spread on his toast!\n\nNorman checked his cupboards for other products with which he could spread on his lonely toast, but Norman was due for a trip to the market and had no suitable substitute for the butter.\n\n\"Well, I can't just waste perfectly good toast,\" Norman huffed under his breath. Norman forced himself to eat the dry, bland toast, washing it down with a small glass of 1% milk. Not about to make the same mistake twice, Norman then took a stick of butter out of the fridge and placed it in a small container on the counter for future use before going about his day.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1599160378.0,"comments":[{"author":null,"text":"Normans a beast","upvotes":16,"created_utc":1599170697.0}]},{"title":"An Epilogue for the Robinsons (Norman, Part 32)","author":"MattressCrane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/ijx984\/an_epilogue_for_the_robinsons_norman_part_32\/","text":"[Click here for part 31!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/iisl2e\/the_olive_garden_norman_part_31\/)\n\n[Click here to go to the beginning!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hsvfbm\/boy_meets_girl_norman_part_1\/)\n\nA week had passed since Norman staged the encounter between Francine and Ernestine. Norman's life was returning to its quiet routine, albeit he felt he returned to the status quo with a few more tricks up his sleeve. He certainly took the time to revel in the steps he's taken over the last few weeks, a newfound confidence in himself, a small taste of what it's like to cause some change in his life, in the guise of helping someone else. It felt good, and while he didn't imagine changing everything in his life, he at least felt confident that he knew what direction to take, if he ever chose to do so.\n\nFrancine had called Norman and asked if he'd like to get coffee, to catch him up on all that's taken place since they last spoke.\n\n\"It went well... \"she started, \"All things considered, it went very well. She didn't like being cornered like that, but I think she realized that it was going to have to happen no other way. It wasn't all great, there was still lots of things that bothered me about how she treats my life choices... But I think it's a step in the right direction. But we had a good talk that night, and the next afternoon when I stepped by her apartment, she actually opened the door. At least now we're talking again, and maybe soon I'll get to see more of a side of her that isn't so cranky.\"\n\nNorman smiled, relieved to hear.\n\n\"And she said she doesn't forgive you- *yet-* but in a week or so she'll be okay. She said she wanted to let you squirm a little bit first, so I'm taking that as a sign that she will eventually come around and forgive you.\"\n\n\"Well that's good news. I think I'm banned from every Olive Garden in the country now, so it's not going to be as casual for me to confront her again.\"\n\n\"I'll put in a good word. So what're you gonna do now?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure.\" Norman paused. \"Perhaps it's a good time I talk to my kid.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"He's in college now, and we haven't spoken in a few months. All this talk about, I don't know, *reconnecting*, makes me feel like a phone call with him would do me some good.\"\n\n\"Well if you're looking to make things right, be sure to be open with him. I don't know what kind of parent you were with him, but so long as he feels himself in front of you, I'm sure you guys are going to be okay. Just take small steps.\"\n\nFrancine and Norman left the cafe, giving a polite hug as they readied to depart ways. Francine thanked him again, and left an open invitation to go and get coffee again sometime soon.\n\n\"Good luck with your son, Norm. I hope it works out for you!\"\n\nNorman smiled, leaving the cafe. He wanted to call Junior soon, and as he walked home, he started walking a little faster, until it turned into a jog.\n\nHe started to feel as if he was in a film, and this was that big moment, that moment of change where the music swells and the cuts get faster, something terrific about to happen. He was going to talk to his son- as soon as he stepped in his front door.\n\n# [Part 33: Small Steps, Then Big Steps](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/imf7ht\/small_steps_then_big_steps_norman_part_33\/)","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1598877795.0,"comments":[{"author":"ParchaLama","text":"It must have taken a long time to write all these.

He liked to show up to work early in order to work on the daily sudoku puzzle in the newspaper before his shift began.\n\nNorman reached into his coffee mug\/pencil holder and grabbed a writing utensil. He preferred pencils for his puzzles in case he made an error, and he kept pens in his desk drawer for documents. Norman studied the puzzle. *Hmm*, he pondered. *I think a six should go here.* He wrote a six in the designated square, admiring how bold it looked. \n\nVery bold indeed. Norman paused for a moment and looked into his hand. He wasn't using a pencil, he was using a pen! But Norman never kept pens in his pencil holder, leaving him bewildered.\n\nJust then, Norman's coworker Lisa walked past Norman's cubicle. \"Hey Norman,\" she smiled. \"I saw you only had pencils on your desk and thought you were maybe out of pens, so I stocked you up!\" Norman nervously thanked her and gave a slight nod.\n\nAs Lisa walked away, Norman darted his attention back to the puzzle. *What if that six doesn't belong there?* Norman contemplated, tapping the pen against the newspaper anxiously. He sighed deeply. *All I can do is press on,* he thought.\n\nNorman grabbed a pencil and slaved away through the puzzle, dreading to potentially find out the pen-drawn six was an unfixable mistake. With every number he filled in, Norman was fixated on the idea that he was making the wrong choice, amplifying his original mistake. \n\nWhen Norman's shift was scheduled to begin, Norman placed the unfinished puzzle in the trash bin and took a deep breath. Norman never could finish an entire sudoku puzzle, but that never bothered him. *It's about the journey, not the destination,* he thought to himself with a slight grin.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1598736288.0,"comments":[{"author":"juliajules","text":"Been there, norman!

Norman was invited back the next week, where he shared all the stories he could about Ernestine, though not as much what the stories she told were, since Francine assumed most of it was hogwash anyways. She found it fascinating to hear about how Ernestine stood up for Norman at the Christmas party, a kind of outward bravery she's never seen in her mother before. Norman bumped into Francine again on a lunch break, now a little curious to the coincidence of bumping into her again. Francine asked Norman if he'd like to get a dinner sometime, and then Norman had an idea.\n\n\"Have you ever been to an Olive Garden?\" asked Norman. Francine answered no, not since her mom would drag her there to have the bread sticks, and Norman said \"Great! On Sunday we'll have plenty of bread sticks.\" Francine accepted, and Norman felt that his plan was on course, even though he didn't know what he would want to do.\n\nNorman was aware that 7 PM on the last Sunday of the month, Ernestine likes to visit an Olive Garden, naturally, to eat lots of food and dine and dash. At first Norman hoped it was a one off joke for her the first time she met, but it was a hobby of hers, taking advantage of the timidness of Olive Garden management around the city. Norman would never join in again of course, as he was afraid that his photo was on record and they would corner him as he tried to leave the building. Often times, at the end of a day of talking with Ernestine, the two would part ways as she would step into the Olive Garden a few blocks away. Norman knew this was his best chance to take the two of them by surprise to see each other, even though he had no plan for how to mediate the situation. It was a shot in the dark, anyways, to see if Ernestine would show in the first place.\n\nIt was a shock to Francine to see her mother unexpectantly in person, only a few tables away from her. She looked to Norman, slowly realizing he had something to do with it. Ernestine looked over at the table, and she froze- turning her head forward, pretending nothing happened.\n\nNorman shrugged to Francine, a small amount of guilt, but feeling that he did what he needed to do, to help his two new friends.\n\n\"Oh Norman. Jesus. I suppose there's no going back now, huh?\"\n\n\"I suppose not. I'm sorry. You're free to leave, I can cover for you.\" said Norman.\n\n\"I... No. This is as good of a time as any. What should I say?\"\n\n\"Hello, for starters.\" said Norman. \"She likes the cheese sticks here.\"\n\nFrancine took a deep breath and stood from her table, heading over to Ernestine. Ernestine averted her eyes as long as she could, but soon enough there was no denying her daughter was standing right in front of her.\n\n\"Hi, mom. Can we talk?\"\n\nErnestine was speechless, letting out nothing but her signature grumbles. Francine took a seat at the table.\n\n\"I'm sorry, mom.\"\n\nNo response.\n\n\"I'm sorry, okay?\" she repeated. Ernestine hung her head down low, refusing to budge. Francine reached and grabbed her hand, and saying it one more time, \"*I'm sorry.\"*\n\nShe looked her daughter in the eye. She felt tired, tired of growing old, tired of waiting.\n\n\"I'm sorry too...\" whispered Ernestine. Francine smiled, wiping a tear from her cheek. Norman smiled, still watching from a few tables away. He decided that it was best he left, no mediation needed. Perhaps they needed to let a few things out, and a few things in.\n\nAs Norman left the restaurant, he was confronted by his old waiter friend.\n\n\"Sir, last time you were in here, you dined and dashed. We'd like to have you come with us and pay, and then you can leave okay?\"\n\nNorman nodded, ready to pay his dues to society. He also picked up Ernestine's tab as well, paying it forward, to help out his dear friend. He didn't know if he would see either of them again soon, but Norman felt happy. Though he knew he lacked the courage to face some of the demons in his own life, he was glad he found the courage to help Francine and Ernestine Robinson.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 32: An Epilogue for the Robinsons](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/ijx984\/an_epilogue_for_the_robinsons_norman_part_32\/)","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1598708581.0,"comments":[{"author":"AlextheLyonnn","text":"She didn't break my heart, yet.

The man got off at the floor before Norman's, but not before he tapped two fingers against his temple in a friendly gesture and said, \"Have a good one, buddy.\"\n\nWhen Norman arrived at his floor, he stepped off the elevator and gave a smile to the receptionist. \"There's donuts in the break room, Norm,\" she said as he passed, and Norman offered his thanks for the information.

They gave him a smile and nod before going back to their planning of a fishing trip the next day.\n\nNorman reached his cubicle, hung his jacket on the back of his chair, sat down, and logged in to check his email.

This morning, he was out of both. \n\nNorman never woke up with the intention of getting groceries. He didn\u2019t keep a running shopping list stuck to his fridge. He had no idea how much bread was left in the bag at any given time. Most of the vegetables he ate came in freezer-bags, so his compost bin was rarely in need of a change. If the milk carton was half-empty, Norman wouldn\u2019t risk it. It would stay in the back of the fridge for a few weeks until the smell started to spread, and then he\u2019d give it another few days before starting a deep-clean. \n\nIgnoring the smell for the second morning in a row, Norman grabbed the butter dish from the second shelf.

Norman had tried reaching out to her, calling her regularly on Sundays and a visit once to her home, but he was always met with silence. After awhile, Norman was growing used to not having anything planned on his Sundays, though it always bothered him, a nagging feeling that the story had yet to be finished. After weeks of preparation, Norman saw two paths in front of him for how to continue, and he chose the one that seemed a little easier, although it seemed just as intimidating. Norman was going to go visit Francine.\n\nHe remembered where she lived- roughly- from when he read the birthday letter. *Woodland Drive, four-five-something-something*, he recalled. It was only a few blocks away from Norman's own neighborhood, and after a few days of making a habit of wandering the neighborhood in his free time, he eventually did bump into Francine once again. He saw her walk up some stairs towards an apartment building, and as she fumbled for her keys, she noticed Norman standing nearby. She politely smiled.\n\n\"Francine Robinson?\" asked Norman. She looked back to him, confused.\n\n\"Yes?\" she asked. Norman wasn't sure how to start.\n\n\"I'm ah... I'm Norman. I'm a friend of your moms, Ernestine?\"\n\nShe still looked just as confused, though he could see she tensed up at the mentioning of her mothers name. Norman waited for her to respond.\n\n\"And did she send you to... say something?\"\n\n\"No she... she doesn't know I'm here. I realize this is strange. I don't really have a plan, really. I just had some things I think I should talk to you... about. Ask you about. Sorry.\"\n\nFrancine eased and laughed at that, finally finding the right key to open the door.\n\n\"Okay Norman, that all sounds fine to me, you can ease yourself. You seem a little timid to be a friend of my moms. Want to come in for a coffee?\"\n\nNorman joined Francine up the stairwell to her second floor apartment, where she welcomed him in and made him a cup of strong black coffee. Norman and her had some proper introductions- Norman mentioning how he knows her mother, though leaving out the best details of the dine and dashing for now. Norman told her about her mothers story, that she said that 'Francine' had died at sea.\n\n\"Hah! Jesus, I shouldn't be surprised. Typical of her to make up something interesting like that. She's addicted to lying, you know. She likes to make up tall tales to distract from the fact she's not happy with her current or past life.\"\n\n\"That seems a little harsh.\" Norman said.\n\n\"You don't know her like I do. She was pretty cold to me, when I was growing up. Always wanted me to be something I'm not, but not that she would encourage me to do something else; but to lie to strangers and hope that I'll not embarrass her by making it true.\n\nShe wanted me to be an actress, something she tried when she was my age. I think it always bothered her, as she saw me as a way to have a second chance, and I was refusing to live that particular way, as if that life that was the only one worth living. But it's always been that for her, and making me feel guilt anytime I acted against her.\"\n\n\"Is that why she won't speak to you?\"\n\n\"No... I guess that's a little more complicated, but I don't feel I'm to blame. I... I didn't invite her to my wedding. I know. But I know her too well, and after years of making me not feel happy with who I am, I didn't have it in me to invite her on a day that's supposed to be... happy for me. And I couldn't picture that with her there. Ever since she's never been able to forgive me for that. At first I felt a little relieved, not to have that constant aggression in my life... But that was almost ten years ago now. Her silent treatment has outlasted that marriage almost ten-fold anyways.\n\nLately I have been missing her, a part of me would regret not making peace with her, since she's getting quite old now. I write her every now and then, a simple way to talk without ever having to see her. She's never responded to me though. I wouldn't be surprised if she just throws them in the trash.\"\n\nNorman grimaced, drinking his coffee to fill the air.\n\n\"I think she's different now,\" started Norman. \"I think she can be quite kind, and warm. There's times of her being crabby and mean, but I think she's changed. I think she's just... Embarrassed, to some degree. I don't think she wants to admit to me she's wrong, but maybe she just feels it's too difficult to admit that now. Maybe that's just me speaking from my own experience as a parent, at least.\"\n\n\"Maybe. But I've reached out to her many times, through letters, phone messages, some unplanned visits, and I feel that's all I can do now. Mom has to want to change, before we can get back in touch. Unless she ever decides to actually answer the door when someone's outside her apartment.\"\n\n\"But what if that never comes?\"  asked Norman.\n\nFrancine stirred her coffee, taking a sip. She shrugged.\n\n\"What're ya gonna do?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 31: The Olive Garden](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/iisl2e\/the_olive_garden_norman_part_31\/)","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1598357884.0,"comments":[{"author":"feedmejack93","text":"The shorter and the plainer the better.","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1598361501.0}]},{"title":"A Game of Chess (Norman, Part 29)","author":"MattressCrane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/idw4rp\/a_game_of_chess_norman_part_29\/","text":">[Click here for part 28!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/ic0exb\/ernestines_daughter_part_28\/)  \n>  \n>[Click here to go the beginning!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hsvfbm\/boy_meets_girl_norman_part_1\/)\n\nA few weeks had passed since Ernestine's birthday, and Norman was having a difficult time carrying the burden of a massive secret. He wasn't sure how to approach Ernestine about it, whether or not to start with that he read her mail, or that he knows that Francine has been alive all along, and that he knows she's lying to him. Confrontation has never been Norman's strong suit. If anything it was the biggest detriment to his life, and while he could jokingly tell that to himself, it was a hard truth that he knew he's struggled to break.\n\nSitting at the park table, a chess board between the two of them, Ernestine pondered her next move. Norman struggled with what to say next, and before he knew it, something came out of his mouth that he wished he could've said better.\n\n\"I still got my bishops,\" boasted Ernestine, \"I don't care that people say a rook is worth more. I'm better with bishops. I get diagonal, taking the straight path's never done me any favors. Hah!\"\n\n\"I read the letter you got on your birthday, Ernestine.

It was Ernestine's birthday, and since he's only known her for six months, he figured he may as well go all out and buy five dollar biscuits. Today would also be a special day for Norman, as he would also go on to discover that Ernestine's long lost and dead daughter, Francine, was still alive.\n\nIt occurred just a few moments before he entered Ernestine's apartment building. As Norman turned the corner, he saw a woman walking in his direction, a sad look on her face. Something punched Norman in the gut about the look of that woman, and though it took a moment, Norman recognized her from the few photographs Ernestine has left of her daughter. She looked about ten years older than any of the other photos, pegging her somewhere in her forties, perhaps his own  age. She was quite beautiful, in Norman's opinion, and while he could see the relation between her and Ernestine, she acted like a very different individual, with the way she walked and carried herself. She smiled and nodded as she passed people on the street, as she did to Norman, when she walked right past him. He didn't know what to say, nor did he know what to do. Failure to act and frozen on the spot, Norman couldn't speak up in time before she disappeared around the corner.\n\nNorman felt sick walking up the stairs, unsure of how he would explain how he let her daughter just get away like that. Perhaps she fell off the boat and was picked up by another boat, keeping her alive in a coma until she had the courage to leave. Or maybe she never was on a boat, and the story was all a front? Cartel? It could have been many things, answers that he would never be able to find now.\n\nJust as Norman was about to knock on Ernestine's door, he noticed a small postcard tucked into her mailbox. He picked up the card, too curious to see if it was all just a coincidence.\n\n*DEAR MOM*\n\n*Hi, just wanted to wish you a happy birthday. I hope everything is well with you. Please talk to me.*\n\n*YOUR DAUGHTER, FRANCINE*\n\n4503 WOODLAND PARK\n\nNorman didn't know how to feel after reading that letter. First he was thrilled to know that Francine has contacted her mother, but now, does that mean Ernestine had already known? How long has this been going on for? On top of all that, he recognized the Woodland Park address- it was a neighborhood only a few blocks away from his own. Norman tucked the letter back into the box, cleared his thoughts as best he could, and knocked on her door. She answered, a slightly soured mood cheered up when she saw Norman.\n\n\"Happy birthday, Ernestine!\"\n\n\"Hi Norm'! Come on in!\"\n\n\"There's mail for you,\" pointed out Norman.\n\n\"Of course there is. All the flyer companies send me something special on my birthday.\"\n\nErnestine grabbed the post card and fliers and tucked them under her arm.\n\nNorman unboxed the scones in the kitchen, as he watched Ernestine out of the corner of his eye, as he watched her get past all the flyers until she reached the postcard. She read it very quickly, mouthing along the words as she read. As soon as she finished reading the card, she let out a low grumble, tossing the card into the trash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 29: A Game of Chess](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/idw4rp\/a_game_of_chess_norman_part_29\/)","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1597755124.0,"comments":[{"author":"AlextheLyonnn","text":"Ooo, getting juicy!","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1597787536.0}]},{"title":"Slightly After Groundhog Day (Norman, Part 27)","author":"MattressCrane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/ibdnh4\/slightly_after_groundhog_day_norman_part_27\/","text":">[Click here for part 26!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/ia7qws\/the_christmas_banquet_norman_part_26\/)  \n>  \n>[Click here to go to the beginning!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hsvfbm\/boy_meets_girl_norman_part_1\/)\n\nNorman readied himself for the Saturday in front of him. It was the day after Groundhog Day, and soon Norman would have to make the investment in a new calendar, if he keeps missing on important holidays like these. Today he was heading out to have another afternoon coffee with Ernestine. It was becoming a routine for the two of them, over the past couple months since the Christmas Party. Back when it was still in the thick of winter, the two would stay in Ernestine's kitchen, at the table the two had put together. With the weather changing, the two started to venture outdoors, which lead to the fun past-time of complaining about icy puddles.\n\n\"The one on my curb is the worst in the city, I tell ya.\" boasted Ernestine, \"A grown man could drown in that one.\"\n\nAs the conversation of the day to day was satiated, they would eventually talk more about themselves. Norman recounted many anecdotes involving Junior, and Ernestine, teased and told faint stories related to her daughter, Francine. Norman was never sure how to react to her stories about Francine.\n\nApparently she had died a few years ago, due to a fishing accident. When stories would come up about Francine's trip, Ernestine's answers would shift over time. She would say it wasn't a fishing trip but a ride on a ferry, or other times, when she would say it was a strong wind that knocked the ship around that threw her over the side, there were also times when she mentioned it as a clear suicide. Norman never knew how to feel about those stories, except that there was more beneath the surface to that relationship that could be perceived.\n\n\"Afternoon, Ernestine!\" Norman said at the door, Ernestine locking up behind her and giving Norman a shove to head back down the stairwell. After navigating their way around the city's deepest sidewalk puddle, the two headed for a nearby park with a promising amount of ducks to feed.\n\n\"Ah, so, how did the call with Junior go?\" asked Ernestine. For the past few days, Norman had been talking about a phone call he was waiting to have with Junior. It wasn't a particularly special event, but it was nice for Norman to hear from Junior, despite it being so brief.\n\n\"He's doing good. He's back in university, again. I remember he had a hard start getting into college when he was eighteen. He dropped out, and worked and traveled for a couple years. It seems to have done him a wonder of good. He's in an arts program now!\"\n\n\"That's good to hear! Chasing his dreams, it sounds like.\"\n\n\"It's a busy life, I don't think I could ever do it. Especially the whole New York lifestyle.\"\n\n\"I used to live in New York, y'know. When I was a young girl. Jazz dancer. *Those* were the days.\"\n\nNorman stepped into a puddle, a very deep one that went all the way up to his shin. Norman said his goodbyes for the week, and limped home to get warm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 28: Ernestine's Daughter](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/ic0exb\/ernestines_daughter_part_28\/)","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1597669091.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Norman pets a dog","author":"Curried_Fox","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/iak1jk\/norman_pets_a_dog\/","text":" The light turned red and Norman came to a stop on the crosswalk with a huff. He did not plan to be out  but he realized when he got home that he did not have everything he needed to make the dinner he wanted that night. Normally, Norman could improvise the best he could, but he had a conversation about his favorite recipe at work earlier that day. Roasted chicken, with green beans, and baked potato. There were no green beans at home, so if Norman wanted to realize his culinary wish he needed to venture out into the world.\n\nIt was only a short walk to the store. Norman told himself he could of used some extra exercise that day anyways. There wasn't any way that there would be any trouble for the trip, he thought. But as Norman waited for the light to turn and an opportunity to cross the sidewalk, he felt a cold chill go down his back.\n\nNorman shook like a tree in a storm. It was a rare feeling for him but a universal one: that somebody was looking at him. He scanned his surroundings like a field mouse searching for a predator. The only other person even close to him was a young woman, and she was in her own world tending to her cellphone.\n\nThe woman was holding a leash, however. And at the end of the leash was a beast of a canine. Black with a white underside, a patterned mask of fur on its face like a Rorschach test, and a shiny black nose at the end of a wolf-like snout. The creature had its icy blue eyes and wide sharp ears cocked at Norman, and it was scanning him like radar. Norman tried to match the canine's gaze but felt an urge to slink back. He realized he couldn't stare down the beast, so he tried a more diplomatic route to try to diffuse the situation.\n\n\"Hello there...\" He sputtered. The dog cocked its head to the side. The woman looked up and joined her pet in looking at Norman.\n\n\"Oh, were you talking to my dog?\" The woman began. The dog took a step towards Norman. \"He's super friendly, you can pet him if you like.\" Norman knew nothing about dogs, and they were intimidating to him. But he had to make a good impression on the one staring him down. The closest knowledge he has was petting his cat, Norman. He was now committed to petting the pet, so he had to come up with a plan and fast.\n\nNorman dropped to a knee and extended his arm and greeted the dog again. The woman allowed a little slack on his leash and the dog began to walk up to Norman. He put his shiny nose to Norman's palm, and after a few tentative sniffs licked his hand. Norman took this as a sign of approval, and pushed his hand past the dog's face to pet its head. He rubbed down its neck and back like he would for his cat Norman.\n\nAfter a few pets, the light turned again and traffic stopped. It was time to cross, and Norman had his out. The woman began down the sidewalk, beckoning her dog and congratulating it on a positive interaction. Norman brushed his hand on his pants, errant threads of black and white fur attaching to his clothes. He was happy to step out of his comfort zone, but much preferred petting his cat to any dog.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1597542659.0,"comments":[{"author":"rachaar","text":"I am very proud of Norman for his cross-species petting venture!","upvotes":10,"created_utc":1597587816.0}]},{"title":"The Christmas Banquet (Norman, Part 26)","author":"MattressCrane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/ia7qws\/the_christmas_banquet_norman_part_26\/","text":">[Click here for part 25!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/i9lnxc\/ernestines_apartment_norman_part_25\/)  \n>  \n>[Click here to go the beginning!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hsvfbm\/boy_meets_girl_norman_part_1\/)\n\nNorman showed up to the ballroom party in his best green bow-tie and brown corduroy blazer, and Ernestine wore a dark blue dress, one that looks like it had some wear and tear forty years before. The hotel was quite large with an extravagant foyer, a dome ceiling and a very nice desk for the concierge.\n\n\"Hello,\" said Norman to the man behind the counter, \"I'm Norman Crumb? I'm here with Easy Path Accounting.\"\n\n\"Of course. It's just down the hall over there. You and your mom have a good evening!\"\n\nAfter nodding politely, they headed down the hall to the ballroom, Ernestine leaving a middle finger trailing behind her back.\n\nThere was assigned seating in main room, pairing off couples with a few others at scattered round tables. Norman and Ernestine found their seats at a table with Frank and Frank's sister, Dannie, Seth with his beautiful date, Hannah, and Lisa the secretary, with her date, Rob. Rob looks a little bit like Norman.\n\nNorman introduced Ernestine to the table, with a confused look from Seth, trying to decide if anyone would join with him if he burst out into laughter.\n\n\"Sorry I'm late,\" said Norman, \"did I miss anything?\"\n\nLisa shook her head. \"Frank was just telling us his political beliefs. Right Frank?\"\n\n\"Just a collective quilt of assholes.\" said Frank, slightly drunk.\n\nLater on with all the guests and tables settled, the small army of waiters and waitresses dispersed into the hall, distributing the many plates of deservedly four star platters of food. Generously cut steaks, heaping glasses of wine, and golden mashed potatoes that tasted better than butter. The table bonded unanimously over how delicious it all was- every bite, followed by several more glasses of wine. Chatting was going strong, and for the first time perhaps in his life, alcohol was making a confident one out of Norman, who decided to tell the whole table a story- of how Ernestine and him met, and the little details of what it felt like to fake a coughing fit and run out of a restaurant.\n\n\"Oh my god! I never could've imagined you breaking the law, Norman.\" commented Lisa, admirably.\n\n\"It was all his idea,\" added Ernestine. \"You have a dark side, Norman.\"\n\n\"Hah! Maybe! Well no, it wasn't my idea, actually, Ernestine stole my wallet-\"\n\n\"-That reminds me of the time I did something similar,\" interjected Seth, \"I dined and dashed outta this fancy restaurant, back when I was in college, hanging with a couple buddies. We were dead broke, but we were really craving lobster.\"\n\nErnestine glared at Seth. Norman looked to Lisa and Rob, busy and laughing now in their own conversation.\n\nHannah very much appreciated his story. \"Hahah, oh my God Seth, you're so bad!\"\n\n\"When's the waiter going to come and refill our drinks?\" asked Frank.\n\n\"*Frank!\"* Dannie said, stomping on his toe.\n\n\"I'm just asking!\"\n\nLisa finished her glass and remembered something. \"Oh, sorry Norman! We interrupted your story!\"\n\n\"Oh no, it's fine. There wasn't too much left of it anyway.\"\n\n\"Did they catch you?\"\n\n\"Well when I started running outside, I think they came chasing-\"\n\n\"-Oh God Frank, have you seen Rich here?\" added Seth onto Norman's story. Frank shook his head.\n\n\"He went *all out.* He's in a *fucking* Tuxedo!\"\n\n\"Hah, Jesus.\"\n\nThe conversation hit the road bump again, conversation rippling and shifting among the group.\n\nLisa's date turned to Ernestine, asking what she used to do for a living. She brought up her work as a professor for a college history program, which surprised Norman, as that was something she never mentioned to him, aside from all the other jobs she's worked. She also mentioned her time in the army, and also retold the story of dating Frank Sinatra.\n\n\"You were stationed in Vietnam?\" asked Frank.\n\n\"Yeah, for a little while. They couldn't fly the broken heli's all the way back to the states to be fixed.\"\n\n\"That's very cool,\" said Rob. \"Are you retired now?\"\n\n\"Do I look retired?\"\n\n\"You look like your enjoying life, so I guess that's a clue that you don't have to work anymore.\"\n\n\"Hah, then yes, I retired back in the 90's-\"\n\nSeth cleared his throat again, ready to speak a little louder now that's he's talking to a senior. \"You **fought** in **Vietnam?** You ever hear of anyone with the last name **Fielder?**\"\n\nErnestine glared at Seth, refusing to answer.\n\n\"Well, that was my family name. My grandpa fought in the war too, though he wasn't in aviation.\"\n\n\"That's so cool,\" added Hannah.\n\n\"Yeah, he was a pretty cool man.\"\n\nYet another wall of silence. Ernestine took a long drink of wine, and then wiped her mouth with a napkin. She cleared her throat, and turned to Seth.\n\n\"How old are you, Seth?\"\n\n\"Twenty three!\"\n\n\"Ah! Twenty three. I remember when I was twenty three. That was the seventies. Now I'm in my seventies. You know, if I could go back and change one thing-\"\n\n\"-I'm just living in the now, trying to-\"\n\n\"**-Let me finish.** If I could go back to being your age, I wouldn't change a whole lot. I'm happy with who I've become, and though I have my regrets, who doesn't? Those little moments of character building and character failing is what makes us who we are. I have a hard time believing someone who makes no mistakes is not clinically sane. Now, I've made a lot of mistakes,\"\n\n\"Me too, me too-\"\n\n\"**Shut it.** Yeah, you've made mistakes, I can tell. I think what I've grown more sure of myself in the decades that I've been alive has not been judging my own character, but the character of others. Petty, I know. I've seen enough personalities shift and change over decades, that I feel I got a pretty good idea of knowing that people never change.\"\n\n\"... It's really hard to say, sometimes.\"\n\n\"No, it's not. If you can see through someone's shell, and take a look at their heart, that's how you can tell. Some people, though they may be in a rough spot at the time I meet them, I can feel good about knowing their heart is in the right place, and be happy for who they can become.\" Ernestine looked to Norman, and smiled.\n\n\"Thanks.\" said Seth, reflexively.\n\n\"I'm not talking about you, Seth. You are a type of person I've seen a dozen times before. You're the same kind of person as my ex-husband, and a boss I had when I worked at a grocery store. You're the alpha male.\"\n\nSeth blushed, flattered.\n\n\"You think that's a good thing, but the alpha male is only as good as his word. Being a man is not about being BIG. Bravado and balls only gets you til your thirty, and when you stop going to the gym and gain weight, and when your hair falls out, you'll be faced with something you're not faced with all that often- dealing with inevitable shit. You can tell yourself all you want that you're better than that- better than the elderly, because you're not old. Or that you're better than the fat because you're not fat. But you'll get there eventually. Or maybe you won't, and leave a pretty corpse.\n\nEither way, I'm not worried about you, because if I did, I would be dead before the time you realize to stop being such a pedantic asshole. So enjoy your closed off life, and try not to drag others into your orbit of being a selfish dipshit.\"\n\nErnestine finished off her glass of wine, taking the last sip of the drink before returning to her food. Not only did she leave the whole table speechless and unsure of what to say, but it grabbed and floored the tables around them too. Seth noticed that everyone heard, and with nothing clever left to say except some cruel words he could say to an old woman, he took Hannah's hand and left the hall to have a smoke.\n\nAn hour later, Norman and Ernestine walked down the sidewalk, laughing wildly.\n\n\"Ernestine! That was incredible!\"\n\n\"Which part? The steak?\"\n\n\"Oh come on, you know what I mean! Showing up Seth like that! It was so cool. He was really embarrassed.\"\n\n\"What a jerk off. Thought he was better than everyone.\"\n\n\"Not you.\"\n\n\"No- not anyone!\"\n\nNorman smiled, feeling a shared victory between them.\n\n\"Do you think it's true, that people can never change?\"\n\n\"... No. I don't think that. People just make mistakes, some their whole lives. But I don't think anyone can't grow past a mistake. And I think me hurting Seth was a mistake, but one worth making at the time. I just wanted to take his ego down a notch; let him taste his own medicine.\"\n\nThey reached Ernestine's bus stop, Norman giving her a hug before they parted ways.\n\n\"Thanks for the steaks!\" she said, showing Norman the three steaks in ziplock bags, hidden in her purse. Norman laughed, waving goodbye as she boarded the bus.\n\nOn his way home, Norman found an old can to kick, struggling to keep himself walking in a straight line home. He had a smile he couldn't hold back, happily strolling home.\n\n# [Part 27: Slightly After Groundhog Day](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/ibdnh4\/slightly_after_groundhog_day_norman_part_27\/)","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1597499735.0,"comments":[{"author":"MattressCrane","text":"Well, I think this is one of longest stories so far, one of the longest of the whole series for sure.

It was a lot less colorful than what he was expecting, when she was describing her life from before. Simple colors, a few pieces of furniture, a single winged chair facing a box television. There were some photos scattered on the walls, mainly landscapes and lavender flowers.\n\n\"Come here, follow me.\" she said, leading Norman through the apartment and into the kitchen. Laying in the center floor was a large, square box.\n\n\"You know Ikea?\" Ernestine asked. Norman gulped.\n\n\"What did you buy?\"\n\n\"I got a kitchen table. Swedish wood. Do you know how to put one together?\"\n\n\"I mean, there's the little booklet that comes with their furniture. In theory anyone can put it together!\"\n\n\"Great! You start laying out the pieces and I'll put on the coffee.\"\n\nNorman turned the box upside down, letting the small pile of wooden slabs, metal poles and plastic pockets of Alan keys fall onto the floor. Finding the seven page Lego set instruction manual, Norman pre-wiped the sweat from his brow and got to work. Ernestine set out a cup for Norman on the counter, filled to the rim with coffee.\n\n\"Don't do that,\" said Ernestine, supervising from above. \"that's backwards.\"\n\n\"It says the sign with the arrow goes in that side.\"\n\n\"and arrow is upside down!\"\n\n\"I don't think so, Ernestine! It's fine!\"\n\n\"Dammit Francine, you're going to break it!\"\n\nNorman swapped the leg around to the opposite side. The arrow *was* upside down. Ernestine humphed.\n\nAn hour passed and the table was looking much more like a table, a few screws either forgotten or unused backups, Ernestine seemed satisfied with Norman's craftsmanship, violently shaking the table back and forth to see if any of the legs were uneven. Norman headed towards the front door, readying to put on his shoes.\n\n\"Looks good to me, Norman. Thank you. Take a break, I'll fix you some lunch!\"\n\n\"No worries, Ernestine, I'm not too hungry.\"\n\n\"Bah, non-sense.\"\n\n\"It's fine, don't worry about it!\"\n\n\"Do you prefer salami or ham?\"\n\n\"Usually I'd prefer ham-\"\n\n\"Ham it is. Mustard, mayo?\"\n\n\"Both?\"\n\nErnestine slapped her hands together, heading back into the kitchen, making quick use of laying out the sandwich ingredients on her new kitchen table. Norman kicked his shoes back off, wandering into her living room, looking at the photographs on the wall, skipping over the flowers and landscapes. A photo of Ernestine young, standing in a flat prairie field. A family portrait- a young married Ernestine, a tall thin man, and a young girl. The photo was faded, hidden away from all the other photos.\n\n\"Do you have a daughter, Ernestine? You've never mentioned her.\"\n\n\"No- yes. Her name was Francine. She would have been your age, if she were still around... Disappeared at sea, on a fishing trip.\"\n\nNorman felt uncomfortable looking into the eyes of the little girl, saddened by such a terrible fate to be taken on.\n\n\"Sorry, Ernestine.\"\n\n\"Wait- did you push her off the boat?\"\n\nErnestine smiled at her joke. Norman didn't join in. A moment later, Ernestine returned from the kitchen with the sandwiches.\n\n\"Sorry. I'm kidding. How about you?\"\n\n\"Me and my wife divorced in 2013, and my son went to college the same year. Well, same day, actually.\"\n\n\"We're just a bunch of childless, marriage-less schmucks.\"\n\n\"I'm surprised I'm having this easy of a time talking with you. I don't talk about Suzanne or Junior... Out loud, all too often.\"\n\n\"It's because I'm old.\"\n\n\"I don't see what that has to do with it.\" said Norman.\n\n\"You're not afraid of needing to fall in love with me. Men- you're all so self conscious. If you're talking with a pretty lady, you feel the need to be on your best behavior, in case *this is it!* You're best bet at growing old with a beautiful woman. Trying too hard, to the point of being too nervous to talk with you. Carelessness is attractive- and you don't care to impress me. I'm the best shot you have at talking with a woman and not crumbling.\"\n\n\"How do I stop doing that?\" asked Norman.\n\n\"Quit acting like waiting for the perfect opportunity to be happy is a reasonable plan. Or just accept that your sad, and bitter, like me. That plan works too. \"\n\nLater on, after Norman and Ernestine finished up their halves of the mustard, mayo and ham sandwich, their visit was reaching its natural conclusion. Despite some crassness and interruptions on Ernestine's part, Norman still enjoyed his visit with Ernestine. Even more-so than Frank by this point, Norman felt like he had a friend in the form of this strange elderly woman.\n\nShe was different from him, and that's what he liked about her.On his way out the door, Norman had an idea.\n\n\"Hey Ernestine, I'm wondering... My work office is throwing a fancy Christmas party in two weeks... Would you be interested in being my plus one? There's going to be wine, steak, all for free. So you don't need to dine and dash.\"\n\nErnestine pondered for a moment, building suspense. \"Hell why not? Sounds good to me, Norman.\"\n\nNorman smiled. He shook her hand goodnight, and headed home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 26: The Christmas Banquet](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/ia7qws\/the_christmas_banquet_norman_part_26\/)","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1597410604.0,"comments":[{"author":"ramen_empire","text":"I love this budding friendship!

His best friend in the third grade peer pressured him to swear (it was *shit*), for the first time in his life. Norman felt awful, vowing to never fall for that crowd again. But Ernestine was different. Something about this old lady inspired Norman, not to break the law, but to chase exhilaration. Though he decided to put a twenty dollar bill in his shoe now, just in case.\n\nWhen Norman arrived in the park the next day, he could spot Ernestine already sitting on a bench, nearby a large iced over fountain. Ernestine seemed happy to see Norman, her tough demeanor from the previous day seemed softened already.\n\n\"How are you Norman? Do you like scones?\" Ernestine pulled a scone from her bag, slicing it in half with a pocket knife. Norman took the scone happily, chewing it quietly, as he wasn't quite sure what to talk about with her. He knew nothing about her and she knew nothing about him, which seems like a perfect amount of possibilities for where a conversation could go, but he couldn't decide what to say. Soon enough however, Ernestine started telling Norman all about herself, in great detail.\n\nTurns out Ernestine had a very, very colorful past. Serving in WW2 as a technician, she repaired the bullet holes in the hulls of airplanes. After that, she married a man named Doug, while she wrote several mystery novels from home. Several hits at the time as well, and once Doug died in a bar fight in 1976, the books were enough to keep her financially afloat ever since. Scattered in between these stories were small anecdotes, like the time she dated Frank Sinatra before he was famous, and the time she fought three robbers off in an alleyway using nothing but a letter opener.\n\n\"That's all very impressive!\" Norman remarked.\n\nErnestine chuckled, nodding along with Norman.\n\n\"It's been an eventful, tough life. I can't complain.\" she said.\n\nNorman had a small coughing fit on the final bite of the scone, taking a few minutes to regain his composure.\n\n\"Hey Norman, do you want to help me with something?\"\n\n\"Um, sure. Why not.\"\n\nErnestine sprung up from the seat, gesturing for Norman to follow along.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 25: Ernestine's Apartment](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/i9lnxc\/ernestines_apartment_norman_part_25\/)","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1597320510.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Norman Robs an Olive Garden (Norman, Part 23)","author":"MattressCrane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/i8cfxt\/norman_robs_an_olive_garden_norman_part_23\/","text":">[Click here for part 22!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/i7qx06\/norman_becomes_a_hostage_at_an_olive_garden\/)  \n>  \n>[Click here to go the beginning!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hsvfbm\/boy_meets_girl_norman_part_1\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNorman's new friend Ernestine looked to a be spry seventy, or perhaps an unhealthy sixty year old woman. He could imagine her on the cover of one of those magazines showcasing people who look identical to their pet, Ernestine holding a white terrier with a snarled lip. She had the kind of confidence he never could find in his own life, as his own low threshold was what was keeping him from a law-breaking lifestyle. He's certainly never met anyone quite like her in his life, and if wasn't for the fact that she was forcing him to dine and dash, he probably never would have.\n\n\"Ernestine, I'm not sure. I don't think I can. If you want to do this it's your business, but I think I'll stay and cover the bill. I'm doing okay financially.\"\n\nNorman pulled out his wallet, placing it on the table. Ernestine predictably grabbed it immediately, shoving it into her purse. \"I'm going to use the bathroom Norman, then I'm going to wait outside at the bus stop. See you soon. I suggest you do the same.\"\n\nBefore Norman could think of what to say, the old woman stepped calmly away from her seat, heading towards the bathroom. A waiter stopped by and asked if everything was okay, and he desperately wished that the waiter could tell, based on Norman's beet-red face and pouring sweat, that he was being held hostage. \"All fine!\" Norman said loudly. Ernestine stepped out of the bathroom, giving one glance back to Norman- a signal in the form of slow finger-swipe across her nose- and vamoose, she was out the door.\n\nThings were becoming dire. It was only a matter of time before the bus arrived and Ernestine disappeared with his wallet, and perhaps only minutes away before the waiter circled around. Norman was out of food, and had nothing left to stuff his face with to avoid making excuses.\n\nStanding up from the table with his knees trembling, he walked as calmly as he could towards the doorway. The waiter at the front gave Norman a closed mouth smile before looking back down at the register, which was enough to cause Norman to abort his plan and slowly circle back towards the restaurant and hide in the bathroom.\n\nRound two, Norman did much better, dawning his sunglasses to hide his shameful eyes, and adopting a new strategy- he was going to cough his entire way out the doorway. No one could expect him to answer if he was in the midst of a coughing fit, and perhaps he just needed some air. Coughing and gagging all the way to the entrance, Norman gathered the attention of every person in the restaurant, the waiter who served his table quickly running to Norman's side to see if he was okay.\n\n\"Are you choking!? Do you need help?\" the waiter asked frantically, grabbing Norman's shoulder.\n\n\"No, I'm okay, thank you!\" Norman exhaled, exiting the door in the mass confusion he just caused. The waiter gave chase up to the doorway, before realizing it wasn't worth the effort, leaving Norman sprinting for his life with no one giving chase. Norman made it just in time to get on the bus, Ernestine laughing wildly as she watched from a window seat.\n\n\"Haha Norman, you're crazy! And you're stupid. I think they're coming for you.\"\n\nSweating and wheezing, Norman tucked behind Ernestine, hiding from the windows of the Olive Garden. While in deep fear at first, once the bus departed and she returned his wallet, Norman had a deep sigh of relief, and laughed in his exhilaration.\n\nNorman and Ernestine continued their chat as the bus continued along its route, Norman giving her a beat by beat breakdown of all the exciting moments he just experienced, and she laughed wildly at how worked up Norman was.\n\n\"That's one of the craziest things I've ever done in my life! I'll have to cut up my credit card; they might be able to find me that way. I've eaten at that Olive Garden many times.\"\n\nThe bus slowed down, readying to pull over into a stop. \"Looks like this is my stop,\" said Ernestine. \"What are you up to tomorrow? Want to hang out?\"\n\nNorman nodded, still catching his breath. \"Sure, why not!\"\n\n\"Hoppenheim park. See you around, Norm'.\"\n\nErnestine departed, waving goodbye to Norman and then to the bus driver. Norman smiled, feeling as if he just made a new friend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 24: A Chat in the Park](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/i8yq7f\/a_chat_in_the_park_norman_part_24\/)","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1597233639.0,"comments":[{"author":"FusiformFiddle","text":"He's 100% going to call the Olive Garden tomorrow to apologize and pay over the phone.","upvotes":15,"created_utc":1597242766.0},{"author":"itsburst","text":"wasnt this story written like a year ago? or a few months ago? i remember reading it before.","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1597247151.0}]},{"title":"Norman Becomes a Hostage at an Olive Garden (Norman, Part 22)","author":"MattressCrane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/i7qx06\/norman_becomes_a_hostage_at_an_olive_garden\/","text":">[Click here for part 21!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/i740cn\/norman_needs_a_friend_norman_part_21\/)  \n>  \n>[Click here to go the beginning!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hsvfbm\/boy_meets_girl_norman_part_1\/)\n\nNorman took a seat in an Olive Garden at the table reserved for eight people that evening. Norman was one of them, and he was also the only one of the eight people that wasn't imaginary.\n\nIf he could help it, Norman liked to book as many tables as he could when he went to  restaurants, to be sure that he would feel comfortable and not crowded as he tried his best to control his bad habit of eating with his mouth open, as well as receive some pity pats on the back from the employees on the way out. If a waiter came by to ask when the rest of his party would be joining him, Norman would be sure to pack his mouth full so that he wouldn't be able to answer his question. Luckily enough, waiters and waitresses always seem to time asking him that question perfectly when he had food in his mouth already, so Norman never felt it was a challenge to keep up the ruse.\n\nA waiter began to walk towards his Norman's large table. Norman quickly began to stuff his mouth.\n\n\"Here you are, miss.\" said the waiter, not to Norman, but an elderly woman- one that Norman had never met before in his life.\n\n\"Thank you sweetie,\" the old woman said to the waiter. \"Sorry, I'm late.\" she said to Norman. Norman's mouth was too full to tell the waiter he didn't  know her, and soon after, the two were in it for the long haul.\n\nShe stayed relatively quiet at first, as she busied herself trying to decide what to have from the  menu. Norman\u2019s timed \u201cahems\u201d and throat clearings didn\u2019t seem to have any effect on her.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d  Norman started, but didn\u2019t finish, as the old woman cut him off. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, son?\u201d she asked sharply. Norman muttered his name, against the point he was trying to bring up-\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Ernestine Robinson. I live over by the Value Village. Where\u2019s your address?\u201d\n\nNorman muttered his address, but intentionally didn\u2019t include his apartment number, in case he was making a dangerous mistake to trust her.\n\n\u201cDo you have a driver\u2019s license?\u201d asked Ernestine.\n\n\u201cErnestine, I\u2019d hate to have to ask you to move, but, I have company coming\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah? Like the last two times I saw you book a table for eight? If they show up I\u2019ll gladly move.\u201d\n\nNorman blushed and hung his head down to the tablecloth. Ernestine humphed.\n\n\u201cNorman, can I make you an offer you can\u2019t refuse?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t refuse?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the deal. My food is going to come, I\u2019m going to eat it. You\u2019re going to buy some, what are those called, some cheese sticks, because I think  they\u2019re delicious and I don\u2019t want to have you watch me eat. Then, when we\u2019re done and they bring the bill... *vamoose*.\u201d\n\n\u201cVamoose?\u201d\n\nErnestine nodded as she violently hacked out some phlegm. \"*Dining and dashing*.\"\n\n\u201cErnestine I uh\u2026 If it\u2019s about money, I\u2019m happy to pay for both our meals, just this once.\u201d\n\nErnestine slapped her hand on the table, clipping Norman\u2019s spoon and sending it flying behind her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s not about money. It\u2019s a rush, Norman, and you\u2019re going to do it whether you like it or not. I can fake a heart attack like it\u2019s no one\u2019s business. And you\u2019ll be sure that the  last word I mutter is blaming you for killing me.\u201d\n\nNorman gulped, wiping the sweat forming at his brow. He saw enough episodes of CSI to know how this would turn out. Doing cocaine to prove he's not a cop. Shooting someone in the knee to prove he's not a cop. Declaring  that he was not a cop, to test the myth that cops must always admit that they're cops if asked directly.\n\nNorman was not a cop. Norman would have to become a criminal.\n\n# [Part 23: Norman Robs an Olive Garden](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/i8cfxt\/norman_robs_an_olive_garden_norman_part_23\/)","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1597148963.0,"comments":[{"author":"TheFaradayConstant","text":"The MattressCrane subreddit now.

We're going to be limiting the guests per person- down to just one.\"\n\nA small uproar surged through the crowd. Rich acted quickly, hushing everyone down so he could add his caveat.\n\n\"I know, I know! But then again, last year we only served cake, finger food and hotdogs. This year we rented a ballroom in a hotel, a true four star experience! Everyone will get their choice of wine, steak, salad, you name it.

Not going to lie, I'm a very naturally popular person. It's hard to choose just one good friend!\"\n\nNorman yelped quietly, accidentally pouring some coffee on the top of his hand.\n\n\"Well, hard for *some* of us,\" joked Seth, nudging Barbara, gesturing towards Norman.\n\n\"Haha oh jeeze, *shhh!\"*\n\nNorman quickly left the room. \"Oh that was mean,\" said Barbara.\n\n\"Don't worry, it's just Norman,\" defended Seth. He checked his phones camera quickly for a moment before setting it back on the table, several conversation tabs left unopened.\n\nNorman sat back in his cubicle, his tail between his legs. Then, he had an idea.\n\n\"Hey Frank,\" started Norman, \"would you like to be my plus one to the Christmas dinner?\"\n\nFrank didn't bother to swivel his chair around the cubicle.\n\n\"I'm already going Norman.\"\n\n\"Oh.

He loved playing Santa for Junior, the *HOHOHO* stomping of the early mornings that he'd rused over the years. *That life is far behind me now,* Norman thought to himself. Life had entered a new chapter over the past eight years, one that left Norman celebrating most Christmas's by himself, usually accompanied by a phone call from Junior and a platonic Christmas card from Suzanne. As this year was building up to feel like all the rest, Norman meandered on the streets and in the shopping malls, nostalgic for the past.\n\nNorman thought back to the 80's, the Christmas when he was eighteen, readying to fly the coop from his parents and begin living on a college campus. His father had a surprise for him- he was going to give Norman his own car. It was a hand-me-down from his father, sure, but it was a car his father loved and took care of gently over the years, a car that Norman rode in his whole childhood. His father was a cold man, and Norman always struggled to communicate with him, before his dad died a few years before Junior was born. Norman always felt a deep connection to his dad's old Daihatsu. Norman did a poorer job up-keeping the old car than his father did, and come time that Junior was turning 18 himself and readying to leave to college, Norman's idea of continuing the tradition came under a different context.\n\n\"Haha jeeze Dad, I hope your kidding,\" Junior said as Norman hinted at the idea of giving him the car as a final Christmas slash graduation present. \"No offense dad, I like the gesture. But that car is more trouble than it's worth now.\"\n\n\"Sure, I suppose it's getting a little rusty, and it's hard to start...\"\n\n\"I got made fun of a lot in school, every time this car would stall in the parking lot and hold up all the buses.\"\n\n\"All it needed was a little jiggle!\" Norman exhaled.\n\n\"That's what everyone would make fun of me for! *Hey Norman, your dad's 'jiggling' in the parking lot again.\"*\n\n\"Your friends call you Norman?\"\n\n\"Only *you* call me Junior.\"\n\n\"That's because your *my* Junior.\" Norman teased. Junior rolled his eyes. Norman could see that his son was serious, and that the idea of getting the old car, despite being a large gesture on his part, wouldn't come across well if he committed to it. He wanted his son to be happy and have a nice parting gift, something that he would actually appreciate. Norman made him a new offer- to sell the Daihatsu, and let Junior decide to buy whatever he likes, a gift from the cash. Norman sold the Daihatsu to Jim, the senior accountant at his office, for a portly sum of seven hundred dollars. With the money, Junior bought himself a new cellphone. Norman wondered if Junior still had the same phone, or if he's gotten rid of it by now. He wondered if he had a new phone if his son would call more often.\n\nHeading through the parking lot of his office always made him slightly uncomfortable, as Jim still drives the old Daihatsu to work everyday. As Norman would wait for the public bus to stop in front of the building, Jim would wave goodnight to Norman, as he stepped into the old rusted car and struggled to start it up.\n\n\"You got to jiggle!\" shouted Norman.\n\n\"What!?\"\n\n\"JIGGLE!\" Norman shouted, rocking back and forth on the bench, miming a jiggling motion. Jim shook the small car, sputtering back to life once again.\n\n\"Ah, thanks Norm! Happy holidays!\" said Jim, as the car pulled out of the lot and onto the street. Norman waved goodbye, his smile dissipating as the car turned the corner, gone out of sight and ready to be seen again tomorrow morning.\n\n\"Happy holidays indeed,\" muttered Norman.\n\n# [Part 21: Norman Needs a Friend](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/i740cn\/norman_needs_a_friend_norman_part_21\/)\n\n&#x200B;","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1596980357.0,"comments":[{"author":"FusiformFiddle","text":"Aww, this one hit me in the feels.

The cubicle became a rather quiet place- albeit it had always been a quiet place. Norman missed saying \u201cMorning\u201d and \u201cEvening\u201d to someone, and while Norman tried his best to make a friendship blossom with the secretary, Lisa, Norman\u2019s greetings were only met with a distant smile. Norman did not confront Frank about the shouting he heard that one night, or the night after that, or the one after that, before Frank left on vacation leave. In Norman\u2019s defense, it was never as aggressive or violent as the first night; it was slow and dithering fighting, one that Norman supposed exhausted itself after some time.\n\nOne night, Norman came home and heard no shouting, no fighting. It was quiet. Norman was relieved that it came to an end on its own without him needing to get involved, but he was left wondering how it came to be. Did Josie leave? Did she take Amber with her? Or did they work it out? Or were they killed and hid in the closet? Were they hid in Norman\u2019s closet? Norman checked his closet, and learned nothing. He continued to speculate regularly as he rode to work on the public transit, to put his hours into the small and empty cubicle.\n\nThe smell of Vietnamese lunches started to dissipate, weeks passed, and Norman\u2019s mind started to become occupied with irrelevant day-to-day problems once again. Norman walked home from the grocery store one evening, settling on having chicken breasts and rice for dinner. It was his favorite meal- he didn\u2019t know why, it just was- and he was soon daydreaming about if he would rather bread the chicken or have it grilled. Norman waited for the dreadfully slow apartment elevator to arrive. There are only three floors, Norman grumbled to himself, as he shifted the plastic shopping bag from one hand to the other, trying to revive his curled fingers from feeling so numb.\n\nThe elevator doors opened to reveal Frank, his head hung down, buried into his phone. He would have walked past Norman completely if Norman hadn\u2019t mumbled hello.\n\n\u201cHey Norman,\u201d said Frank quietly. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood, good\u2026 How\u2019s your vacation? Did you go anywhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought about it. I have family in Maine I was thinking of visiting\u2026\u201d\u2019 Frank stepped out of the elevator, shifting his way towards the front door of the apartment. \u201cBut I changed my mind. Just kicked it here for the time being.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s always good to take a break,\u201d said Norman. Frank nodded.\n\n\u201cWhen will you be back at work?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot sure, Norman. At least another week. I was thinking I might quit.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh really?\u201d said Norman. \u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d said Frank. Frank stepped towards the door.\n\n\u201cAnyways, I have to run Norman. Good to see you.\"\n\nFrank made his way towards the door, leaving behind Norman with an open mouth.\n\n\u201cFrank,\u201d Norman called out, before the door shut completely. Frank stuck his foot out. Norman hesitated for a moment, unsure if he was about to say something rude- if he wanted to say something rude- or if saying something rude was the only option he had.\n\n\u201cIs everything okay, Frank?\u201d Norman started to blush, feeling as if he\u2019d overstepped a boundary.\n\nFrank shrugged. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. He then started to laugh it off, passing it as depraved humor. Norman didn\u2019t join in. \u201cWell if you want\u2026 I have some extra chicken breasts for dinner. If you\u2019d like to join me and my cat Norman tonight\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYour cat\u2019s name is Norman?\u201d joked Frank.\n\nNorman nodded. \u201cI never knew that..

Why not.\u201d Norman nodded to Frank and Frank nodded back, before Norman nodded one more time and made things uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cSee you, Norman.\u201d Frank said. He stepped out the front door, and Norman called for the elevator one more time, with a warm smile on his face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 20: Christmas, 2017](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/i6jhe1\/christmas_2017_norman_part_20\/)","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1596894439.0,"comments":[{"author":"MattressCrane","text":"Welp, here's the end of \"Chapter 2\"!

Junior played in his baby bouncer as Suzanne prepared dinner: chicken breasts and rice. Norman wasn\u2019t a fan of chicken breasts- they were always a little too dry for his tastes- but he wasn\u2019t one to complain to his wife. *She has enough on her plate as is,* Norman thought.\n\nDinner was served at the table as the three of them craned their heads towards the living room, absent-mindedly watching America\u2019s Funniest Home Videos as it played on the television, still muted from before. A small dog ran into a plate glass window. Norman chuckled softly, and Junior, a fourteen month old baby, laughed so hard that he spewed up chicken back onto his plate.\n\nNorman only managed a jerk forward motion to clean up before Suzanne took the lead. She took the plate out of Junior\u2019s reach and tossed it into the kitchen sink, clanging violently with the dishes from the day before. She then went over to Junior, pulled his shirt off, and stomped over to the laundry room.\n\n\u201cNeed any help?\u201d Norman muttered. No response.\n\nShe disappeared into the laundry room, shutting the door behind her. *What\u2019s she doing in there?* Norman wondered. Norman continued to eat his dinner. Ten minutes later the episode of AFV had finished (the plate glass dog had won the ten grand), Norman\u2019s wife still hadn\u2019t come out of the laundry room. Norman wondered if she was angry at him, if it was something he said. He didn\u2019t see why that would be- he barely said anything at all this evening. Was it his socks? He did do a lot of walking about today, and perhaps the stench was getting to her.\n\nNorman walked quickly past the shut door and headed for the bedroom, finding a fresh pair of socks and put them on. He then sat down in his recliner, a wedding present from the in-laws. He picked up Junior and placed him on his knee, rhythmically bouncing the little boy as he flipped through the channels, looking for something different to watch.\n\n# [Part 19: Sometime Later](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/i5zeef\/sometime_later_norman_part_19\/)","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1596809698.0,"comments":[{"author":"itsburst","text":"What will happen to Norman","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1596831803.0}]},{"title":"Norman awaits a knock","author":"effygee","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/i5gqe1\/norman_awaits_a_knock\/","text":"*\"Today is the day!\"*, Norman hummed to himself as he knotted his favourite tie. *\"Today is the ~~\"*\n\n***Thunk***\n\nA crash shook Norman alert.

He crumbled the cookie down to a powder, making sure to fight the urges as he stayed true to a diet he started the week before. As he walked through his apartment hallway, just about to peel open the wrapper and read his fortune, Norman heard shouting.\n\nIt was Frank and Josie. As Norman neared their apartment door, the shouting grew louder, harsher, more explicit, and clear as day.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking cunt, Josie! Always were! You gonna try to raise a cunt daughter?! Not on my watch! Don\u2019t you fucking dare!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say this shit in front of her, and she\u2019s going to end up fucking miserable like you! You\u2019re a piece of shit!\u201d\n\nNorman could hear Amber in the room too, a wailing cry. It shook the walls. Norman choked on saliva as he struggled to swallow, his head throbbed in the burst of anxiety, his knees wobbled, and his fist hovered by the door, desperately hoping to gain the momentum and knock.\n\nThis is that slap in the face, Norman thought. The fighting was relentless and it wouldn\u2019t stop unless Norman did something. Norman would just have to knock, that\u2019s all, and perhaps it wouldn\u2019t solve anything, but at least it would stop the fighting. A simple knock on the door. He did it all the time. He wasn\u2019t tired, wasn\u2019t lazy, and he had no physical excuse in the world not to just do it. What if the knock wasn\u2019t heard? What if they were so heavily in the throws of their fight that, no matter how hard he knocked, it wouldn\u2019t be noticed? Norman had no excuse, none but the ones he gave himself, the moments of hesitation forming to something tangible. No one would hold Norman accountable if he didn\u2019t say anything. He could still be at the Chinese restaurant, for all anyone cared. If someone else came through the hallway, perhaps they could knock together. Anyone at all, somebody else. It would be safer that way. It would all end up okay.\n\nNorman unlocked the front door to his apartment. It was quiet, calm inside. A leftover pot of tea from the morning sat on the counter, and his cat slept soundly on the recliner, moving to a stretch as it became aware of Norman coming home. Norman changed into his cozies and turned on television, aimlessly flipping through the channels. He muted the television, and listened carefully. He couldn\u2019t hear anything. He didn\u2019t know if it was always this way, or if the fighting had stopped. He could hear stomping on the ceiling sometimes. The streets below often echoed honking horns through the cracked kitchen window. It wasn\u2019t always this quiet. Things could be worse.\n\nNorman pulled the fortune cookie wrapper from his coat pocket, still filled with the crumbs and fortune inside. Norman pinched open the package and pulled out the paper.\n\n\u201cTwo days from now, tomorrow will be yesterday.\u201d\n\nTwo days from now will be Friday, Norman tried to joke with himself. Norman lifted the package upwards and poured the crumbs into his mouth. He didn\u2019t forget about his diet, but he knew that one cookie wouldn\u2019t have made that much of a difference anyways. A single cookie was the least of his worries.\n\n# [Part 18: A Chance for Norman](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/i5ekeg\/a_chance_for_norman_norman_part_18\/)","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1596721134.0,"comments":[{"author":"kenzo535","text":"Very good!

It was in the lobby of the apartment complex, with a long draped curtain separating the front desk clerk and mailboxes from the washing machines and driers. Norman didn\u2019t mind waiting in the designated seating area, as it gave him plenty of time to contemplate what he would rather be doing once he returned to his home. Norman day-dreamed about what sort of day-dreaming he would do back in the comfort of his recliner, a cat in his lap and a tea in hand.\n\nNorman was caught mid-smile as the curtain was pushed open, a small head peeking through, looking square at Norman. Soon the head disappeared back into the fold, and Josie, Frank\u2019s wife, entered the room with a basket of laundry. The little girl followed closely, wary of Norman in the corner.\n\n\u201cNorman, right?\u201d Josie said as she loaded the laundry into a machine. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you lived in the building too.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I live just a few doors down from you.\u201d Norman said matter of factly, in a certain way that made it hard for Josie to continue a conversation. She nodded, inserting fifty cents into the machine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that night,\u201d Norman started, \u201cI usually don\u2019t drink. It was a special occasion.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot for Frank\u2026\u201d Josie retorted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry too, I suppose. I was just angry at my husband. It was his birthday and Amber here made him a cupcake and\u2026 Sometimes I wish he was just more considerate.\u201d\n\nNorman shook his head in agreement. Amber busied herself with the candy dispensers, checking to see if anything had been forgotten.\n\nHe thought about the promise he had made to himself that night; to save Frank\u2019s marriage. It seemed so silly in hindsight, and now, speaking to a reasonable and not at all villainous Josie, Norman was even less certain of what he could do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 17: Norman's Second Chance](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/i4rz3u\/normans_second_chance_norman_part_17\/)\n\n&#x200B;","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1596637622.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"A Regular Work Day (Norman, Part 15)","author":"MattressCrane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/i3jyzs\/a_regular_work_day_norman_part_15\/","text":">[Click here for Part 14!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/i2wz2l\/frankly_drunk_norman_part_14\/)  \n>  \n>[Click here to go to the beginning!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hsvfbm\/boy_meets_girl_norman_part_1\/)\n\nAfter the uncomfortable encounter with Josie, Norman felt ashamed for saying nothing, and now, a week later, he still hadn\u2019t spoken to Frank either. Things had returned to the status quo, and for Norman, a man who tried his best to shut his front door quietly as to not disturb a sleeping cat, was partially relieved.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Frank said as he showed up for work, ten minutes late, per usual.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Norman said back.

I\u2019ve forgotten to give it back until now, unfortunately.\u201d\n\nFrank swiveled his chair around to Norman, took the key from his hand, and solemnly turned back to his desk.\n\nNorman wanted to say something positive, to regurgitate some sort of fun fact that he read. Nothing was coming to mind; only a story about insurance scamming in China. Norman hadn't forgotten the dire promise, but as time went on, Norman continually felt it was a fools errand. He didn't want it to be, but what else could it become? Perhaps if a scenario slapped him square in the face, Norman's courage would muster. Frank's hands rested on top of his keyboard, breathing calmly, staring nowhere.\n\nNorman said nothing, and returned to work.\n\n# [Part 16: The Laundry Room](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/i46akr\/the_laundry_room_norman_part_16\/)","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1596550176.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Frankly Drunk (Norman, Part 14)","author":"MattressCrane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/i2wz2l\/frankly_drunk_norman_part_14\/","text":"[Click here for Part 13!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/i1sjt9\/franks_wife_norman_part_13\/)\n\n[Click here to go to the beginning!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hsvfbm\/boy_meets_girl_norman_part_1\/)\n\nNorman called for a taxi, after numerous hours of drinking with Frank and the patrons of The Pub. It\u2019s almost midnight, Norman grumbled to himself. Norman\u2019s knees wobbled like he had just climbed a flight of stairs, and Frank was, well, Frank was struggling to stand on his own. After a dozen shots, Frank seemed like a much younger man. More so like an infant requiring constant attention, but Norman didn\u2019t mind taking care of the down-on-his-luck cubicle friend. It reminded him of his son Junior, back when Junior had no manners and said rude things to strangers on the street.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your arm!?\u201d Frank shouted at a one armed man on the sidewalk, \u201cdi-did it fall off!?\u201d Norman hung his head to the ground and apologized more than he could count in this state.

He figured that he must\u2019ve come up in conversation at least once, over the decade. Apparently not.\n\n\u201cGet in, Frank.\u201d she said, grabbing her husband by the collar. The little frog in Norman\u2019s throat became lodged, as his chance to speak up to Josie was lost. Norman stood in the hallway, regaining his composure. He saw Frank\u2019s little key sitting on top of the welcome mat.\n\n# [Part 15: A Regular Work Day](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/i3jyzs\/a_regular_work_day_norman_part_15\/)","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1596461082.0,"comments":[{"author":"feedmejack93","text":"Lifeoffrank","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1596461302.0},{"author":"aftermine1","text":"really loving these OP!

He wanted to console Frank, to tell him what he needed to do to avoid the same fate that Norman\u2019s marriage had. But that was an answer to a question that Norman was never able to solve.\n\nQuiet little whimpers came from underneath Frank as his head rested in the palm of his hands. At that moment, Norman made a promise to himself. While his own marriage was in the toilet, he knew that he couldn\u2019t live with himself if this one went awry as well. He didn't know how he would do it, or if it was something that a small man like himself could ever solve in the first place.\n\nI\u2019m going to save your marriage, Frank, Norman thought.

Frank was slender, balder, and far more quiet than Norman- whose own hushed demeanor was something not to be underestimated. For the past nine years, the two men sat solemnly beside each other in the confines of their cubicle. In the morning they would say \u201cMorning\u201d to each other, and as they packed up their briefcases for the day, they would say \u201cEvening\u201d, even though both of them left the office at the same time, rode the elevator at the same time, and even waited at the bus stop at the same time. It didn\u2019t help that they lived in the same apartment building, as well as the same floor.\n\nNorman knew very little about Frank. Occasionally he would hear Frank discuss politics with Robert from sales, and from the amount of times Frank ordered in for lunch, Norman could tell he was a fan of Vietnamese food. Norman also knew that Frank had a wife named Josie, and an eight year old daughter named Amber. Norman felt that this was his one connection to Frank, if the two ever talked. Their dynamic reminded Norman of his own family, living an alternate universe just ten years ahead. He was happy for him, but still, a part of Norman wished he were more like Frank.\n\nThe change of status quo occurred when Norman received a work-email on a Friday afternoon.\n\n*\u201cHello everyone,*\n\n*Just a reminder that today is Frank Jenkins's birthday! Please take a moment in your day to wish him Happy Birthday!\u201d*\n\nNorman hesitated. He quickly closed the email, just in case Frank saw it. It would spoil any surprise birthday parties, if anyone had happened to plan one for him. Norman then had to consider his options- say Happy Birthday to his face, and risk stumbling over his words, or write a carefully worded, but less thoughtful, email?\n\n\u201cHey Norman,\u201d said Frank as he swung his chair around, \u201cit\u2019s my birthday.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh really? Happy-birday,\u201d Norman slurred unconvincingly. He wished that Frank had said that to him in an email instead.\n\n\u201cSince it\u2019s Friday, I\u2019m looking for someone to get drunk with tonight. I don\u2019t normally ask you, but all I know is I\u2019m not getting home until it\u2019s real late. You in?\u201d\n\nNorman scoured his mind for an excuse, but as his head swiveled slowly in deep thought, Frank took it as a nod of agreement.\n\n\u201cGreat.

What started out as an awkward teen with a passion for fantasy novels and useless college degrees transformed into a family man, and a while he loved his family man lifestyle for the past eighteen years, it was hard to uphold that persona without a family. Sure, he had his cat, but the cat felt more like a roommate, someone who steals food and sits and farts in Norman\u2019s chair when he\u2019s not looking. It was an odd new life for Norman, living in an apartment by himself, but he found within a few weeks he was adapting quite fine.\n\nA rhythm took place over his life. He would head to work, filling in his day working in a cubicle with his cubicle mate, Frank. During lunch he would surprise himself with whatever D3 was in the sandwich vending machine that day, and as the work day ended and he headed home in via the subway, he\u2019d kick off his shoes, squeeze off his socks with his heels, and searched for his cat, who was always in a perpetual state of napping. After fixing himself a simple dinner of a meat complimented with a grain, Norman would sit in his recliner, flip on the television, and idly watch whatever the TV recommended along that hour. CSI was his favorite new show, at the beginning of this chapter in his life. *I could get used to this routine,* Norman thought to himself.\n\nThis routine would stay relatively the same for the following seven years.\n\nThere was some hiccups and changes throughout the years, but all small and temporary, nothing but setbacks and distractions. The summer that Norman had bedbugs. The time he learned he\u2019d failed to properly do his taxes for a few years, and had to find a small fortune. The time work sent him on a work retreat to Hawaii, or the time his cat fallen ill and learned there was a small pile of rat poison in the apartment complex. Norman enjoyed these endeavors as they came along, as they felt like a distraction from what was bothering him most.\n\nHe could never quite wrap his head around what was the tipping point in the relationship with his wife. He's been the same he's always been, a quiet and collected individual who caused no drama in others lives, let alone his own. He supposed he could get why she was tired of that life, but he couldn't accept it, as if to say the way he was, inherently, was the issue. Should he fight who he is if it means he can live with others not suited for his lifestyle, or keep being the way he's always been, despite all the problems it's causing? They were difficult topics, complicated issues with years of contemplation behind them now. There were no easy questions, no apparent answers. Perhaps it's because he knows the default answer is to stay the same, which is what he's been doing successfully these past numerous years. But because he's never been satisfied with the way things are, it always pointed to the fact that he might've been wrong the whole time.\n\nIt was an average Tuesday. Norman  ordered a maple flavored iced cappuccino and a sausage-and-egg muffin from the fast food joint near work, and came to his office early, per usual.\n\nA stack of papers for a half weeks worth of work waited on his desk, a task that didn't need constant attention but frequent attendance. Norman got to work.\n\nNorman  thought about the night he met Suzanne, back at the failed speed dating night, and his thoughts on which subway bus to take on the way home- the same as her. Norman squeezed his eyes shut, until the stars appeared. He  forced himself to think about what he would be having for dinner. It  didn\u2019t matter what it was, so long as it overcame his thoughts. *I\u2019ll be having chicken for dinner,* Norman stated, *with Sprite.*\n\nHe loved his wife dearly. He couldn't blame her completely on wanting to leave him to live her own life, but part of him wishes he said something, that during that final hug he could've said something more, to ask her to reconsider...\n\n*Stop,*  Norman thought. He tried to remember which episodes of CSI were  recorded over the week. He focused on his pencil, thinking about why HB2  could be so successful, to the point of pushing HB1 to extinction. Junior used to tease Norman about his persistent use of only pencils, that pens were far too much of a commitment for him-\n\nNorman snapped his pencil. Norman thought about if he were a different sort of man, that perhaps it would have been okay for Suzanne to leave for awhile, to find herself. Maybe the divorce wasn't necessary, just a jerk reaction to be stuck between a rock and a hard place. He felt that without her, without the family, he lost his connection to his son, nothing left tethering them together now except for the genetics they shared; the personal differences too vast, where meeting each other halfway would still be miles away from who they are. He was no longer The Family Man. He was Norman, who just turned fifty.\n\nNorman counted the tabs he had open on his computer, counting down until none were left, and then counting back up, until he surpassed the original  number. He counted the change in his pocket, deciding if it was enough for both the subway fare and a bag of chips later tonight. He felt a cold object in his pocket.\n\nNorman pulled his wedding ring out of his pocket. He must have forgotten it there, kicking around in that pair of pants since the last wash.\n\nBack in his apartment is a shoe-box, filled with trinkets and memories,  stretching all the way back to when he was a small boy. Good memories,  some sad, but all things he\u2019s cherished, and never wanted to forget. A  baseball card. A hair-clip, a comb, a rusted coin. A Polaroid, some flattened flowers; drawings from his son. Norman thought of returning the wedding ring to the box of memories, but at the same time, he thought it might be best if he just let it be, separate and ready to be discarded.\n\nThe ring would wait on the edge of his desk, near enough so that it would  only take a flick or a misplaced glass of water to cause it to fall  down into the wastebasket. It was a decision he would have to make someday.\n\n*Someday,* Norman thought.\n\nNorman went back to work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 12: Norman's Cubicle Mate, Frank](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/i0mozh\/normans_cubicle_mate_frank_norman_part_11\/)","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1595945264.0,"comments":[{"author":"MattressCrane","text":"So! Here is the first semi ending of this series. \n\nI've always wanted to write a story of Norman's that told what his divorce with his ex-wife was like.

I think it has a sad ending right now, my way of leaning it to tie into the lifeofnorman subreddit, where every event written here takes place in those 7 years of Norman being a middle-aged bachelor with a cat.

Junior, a fresh graduate from high school, he was soon to be enrolled in a college a few towns over. Suzanne and Norman tagged along for the small road trip, the back seat of Suzanne's van full of suitcases.\n\n\u201cDid you remember to bring your Xbox?\u201d asked Norman.\n\n\u201cNo dad, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have enough free time to being playing video games anymore. It\u2019s a real intensive writing program, so I\u2019ve heard. I\u2019m going to need all the free time I can get.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d added Suzanne. \u201cWhen I was your age, being a writer is what I wanted to do too, when I got older. Now I\u2019m older, and that boat has sailed. Just be sure to live your life to the fullest, while you\u2019re young, and in good health.\u201d\n\nPulling up into the parking lot of the college campus, Norman noted just how many other students were being dropped off by their parents, all at the same stage in life. Junior felt embarrassed as Norman tried his best to introduce his son to all the young pretty girls walking by, but Suzanne made sure to counteract by dragging them along as quickly as possible. A few bags later, all of Junior\u2019s belongings were stacked into his small closet sized room, and soon enough they were ready to leave.\n\n\u201cBe sure to call me,\u201d said Suzanne, teary eyed. \u201cAnd let me know if you need any cash. Don\u2019t go hungry. Don\u2019t feel afraid to reach out.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, guys. I\u2019m going to be okay. Take care of yourselves, I think I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n\nAfter a long and touching group hug, Norman and Suzanne climbed back into the van, and drove away. Norman was quiet, choked, partially from the moment he just had, but also in anticipation from what was to come. This was a big day for Suzanne and Norman as well. It was the end of their marriage.\n\nIt was a conversation that started in secret months before, shortly after the Christmas holidays. Suzanne pulled Norman out of the house to go have dinner alone someplace nice. He joked about how it was the first real date they had in years, and she laughed too, though it was followed by silence until they sat in the booth.\n\n\u201cNorman\u2026\u201d she started, \u201cI\u2019m unhappy. I\u2019ve been unhappy for a very long time. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve felt this way, perhaps from the very start. I shouldn\u2019t say that, I\u2019m sorry. But I\u2019ve felt that I\u2019ve never lived my own life, expressed how I feel, and my whole life up until now has been living for other people. I\u2019m just afraid if I don\u2019t start now, then I never will, and before I know it I\u2019ll die before I\u2019ve lived a single day.\u201d\n\nNorman was speechless, unsure of what to say, how to feel. She mentioned soon after she wanted a divorce, under the assumption it wouldn\u2019t be immediate. It would happen after Junior\u2019s moved out of the home, to save him the trouble of being a child raised by divorcee\u2019s. The date was saved, but as time went on, and the deadline came closer and closer to Juniors departure, the plan for how Norman would be reintegrated into society changed. Norman would be moving out the same day as Junior, to be dropped off at a new apartment he'd  been suggested to by his cubicle mate, which Norman had been secretly paying for the past few months.\n\nIt was a quaint place, just large enough for Norman to live alone, though through negotiations, it was decided Norman would keep the cat.\n\nNorman stepped into the new apartment, Suzanne helping him carry in the bags.\n\n\u201cWell, looks like I\u2019m home!\u201d Norman joked, shyly. Suzanne laughed pleadingly, unsure of how to handle the moment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Norm. I\u2019m sorry it has to be this way. I love you, I really do. But\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Suzanne. No worries. I get it. I want you to be happy. I hope\u2026 I hope it works out for you.\u201d\n\nSuzanne opened her mouth and no words came out. She shrugged, and laughed uncomfortably again. Norman gestured for a hug, and she came forward, braced in his arms. She started to cry, and so did Norman.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the end,\u201d said Suzanne, \u201cit\u2019s a start, okay? A fresh start for both of us. For all of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cA fresh start sounds nice,\u201d whispered Norman.\n\nSuzanne waved goodbye one last time before closing the door on her way out. Norman walked over the window overlooking the street, and watched as his wife climbed into her van, turned the ignition, and disappeared around the block. The apartment was quiet. He\u2019d yet to put batteries into the new clock, already hung on the wall. The fridge here hummed a little louder than in the home he had before. The cat meowed, hungry, searching for the apartment for her food dish.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get you some food,\u201d Norman said to the cat. He gestured to the cat, but his legs failed to move. Norman kept staring out the window, not sure what he was waiting for. *A new start,* he muttered to himself. Norman put his shoes back on, heading to the store around the corner, looking for the cans of salmon that the cat liked to eat, on special occasions.\n\n# [Part 10: The Life of Norman](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hzf9xb\/the_life_of_norman_norman_part_10\/)","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1595863423.0,"comments":[{"author":"dustyshade","text":"This brought so many emotions to the surface.

It was a tradition of his for many years, an unspoken truth hidden from Junior- the identity of Santa Claus. Norman would enter the living room, stomping his feet towards the tree, before bellowing out a \u201cHO HO HO!\u201d through the house. When Junior was just a boy, he\u2019d squeeze his eyes in fear of Santa learning that he was awake. Now, eighteen years old and somewhat more the wiser, the tradition was nostalgic, and soon ending.\n\nJunior put on his comfy clothes, stepping out of his room to the kitchen and started to brew some coffee.\n\n\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d asked Norman to Junior, obliviously.\n\n\u201cWas it Santa, I think?\u201d played along Junior. Norman shrugged.\n\nLater on, once the coffee was poured, the family gathered around the tree, Norman dispersing presents to the three of them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a smaller Christmas than the other years,\u201d Norman reassured. \u201cWe\u2019re all old enough to buy the things we want ourselves. But it\u2019s just nice to open up something on Christmas!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry dad, I know.\u201d\n\nNorman received a new bag of peanuts, his favorite gift to get on Christmas. Junior had a new slinky and bouncie ball, pristine from a mall vending machine. Suzanne got a new pair of socks. It was a timid Christmas, but with none of the three being all too materialistic, small gifts to unwrap was plenty satisfying for the morning. \u201cYou know, this might be our last Christmas together for some time,\u201d Norman reminded.\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d said Junior.\n\n\u201cNext year you\u2019ll be in college! Crazy to think about, you\u2019re just about an adult now. Time flies so fast, it seems, life flying by before you even know it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah! Jeeze. That's crazy to think about.

It was a special day indeed- both Junior's eighth birthday, as well as the day that Norman would fulfill his own childhood dream, of growing up in a house with a pet. When he was a boy himself, his mother was allergic to cats, and his father hated dogs, which left Norman with only the distant wish of having a little loving critter in his home. Now, an adult capable of his own decisions, he was going to make that come true.\n\nJunior and Suzanne came home a few hours after that, Junior running into the house carrying a small paper bag in one hand, a piece of cake on a paper plate in the other.\n\n\"Hi dad!\" screamed Junior, running to the couch.\n\n\"Hi Junior!

Remember- be gentle!\"\n\nIntrigued and excited, Junior sprinted to the hallway, disappearing in his room. Suzanne shrugged to Norman.\n\n\"What did you get him?\" she whispered.\n\n\"It's a surprise!\" said Norman. Soon, gleeful child screeches roared through the house. A little kitten, a grey and white and chubby little cat started to bounce its way into the living room. Suzanne was shocked. Norman must have forgotten she was mildly allergic to cats, her skin breaking out anytime she'd visited her grandparents when she was a kid. It's why she always would've preferred a dog, if the conversation of getting a pet came up.\n\n\"Thanks ma, thanks dad!\"\n\n\"Remember Junior- it's not a toy. It's a living, breathing creature. You'll need to feed it everyday, take it for walks-\"\n\n\"I promise, I promise I promise!\" Junior laid on the floor on his belly, swatting his hands around the cat as it nipped and jumped around his fingers. Norman couldn't stop smiling, turning to Suzanne, patting her on the back. A special day, indeed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 7: Another Sunday](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hwf2zj\/another_sunday_norman_part_7\/)","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1595423315.0,"comments":[{"author":"NeverStopWondering","text":"For some reason I always imagined Norman the cat to be orange furred.","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1595485378.0}]},{"title":"Hope this kind of post is allowed.

He was going through a difficult transition in the office, with his newfound promotion to a full time accountant. Keeping his life in order while learning so many new skills was a real challenge, though after four years of slumming it up the work totem pole, he was happy to see some results for his efforts.\n\nComing home from work, Norman began his daily routine of decompression. He started with kicking off his loafers, followed by pinching off his socks by stepping on them with the opposite heel. After loosening his tie, he would go and search for Junior, his dear boy Junior, who was always in a perpetual state of napping by the time he would come home. After that, Norman would search for Suzanne, wherever she was hiding. Norman was always glad to have her here, taking care of the house and the baby. While he greatly appreciated the family life, he often struggled keeping up with the family burdens.\n\n\u201cEvening, hon.\u201d Norman said, grazing his hand on Suzanne\u2019s back as she stood in the kitchen, finishing off a sink of dishes. \u201cGet any writing done today?\u201d\n\nSuzanne sighed, brushing the damp hair out of her eyes with her forearm. \u201cIt went fine. Another page down!\u201d she said, emphatically.\n\nNorman smiled, patting her on the back. \u201cWell, before you know it, you\u2019ll have a full book done! And then I could say I\u2019m married to a published author!\u201d\n\nSuzanne nodded. She knew Norman was just being supportive, in the ways that he knew how. She didn\u2019t write a page today. She succeeded in staring blankly at the monitor for a few hours, and killed her free time with television. She was stuck, written herself into a corner, and as far as her story was concerned, she didn\u2019t know where it would go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 6: The Family Gets a Cat](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hvth6h\/the_family_gets_a_cat_norman_part_6\/)","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1595335255.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Suzanne, Norman, and Junior (Norman, Part 4)","author":"MattressCrane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/huk675\/suzanne_norman_and_junior_norman_part_4\/","text":">[Click here to go to the beginning!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hsvfbm\/boy_meets_girl_norman_part_1\/)  \n>  \n>[Click here for part 3!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hu0tzk\/norman_suzanne_go_on_a_date_norman_part_3\/)\n\nSuzanne wasn\u2019t always certain of what her future would look like after graduation. A confident girl who recognized that a degree in philosophy and a dream to be an author wasn\u2019t the best of career prospects, she worried frequently about how she would manage to find a career that was just as stable as it was passionate for her. One year out of her program and still working in the local cafe just a few blocks away from her low rent apartment she shared with five people, she wasn\u2019t happy, and she didn\u2019t know what to do about it. She often thought about her own mother, who never pursued her career passion in life, but ended up happy anyway, raising two boys and two girls. Suzanne could never imagine herself as a mother, but then again, her mother seemed fulfilled, a fulfillment she\u2019s never been able to find on her own.\n\nAfter that fateful night of meeting a timid and kind man named Norman on a subway home, Suzanne\u2019s views started to change. Perhaps a life of adventure is overrated, and Norman, this quiet and humble man who seems to be always satisfied with even the smallest of delights, might\u2019ve gotten it right. Sure, she had her doubts about being with him- the way he picked his teeth in the middle of the conversation bothered her from the first night she met him, and the way he stammered over his words and waved goodbye politely to the men who catcalled her as they walked past a pub made her realize Norman would not be one to raise his voice, if push ever came along to shove. But nonetheless, she was happy to know him, this short man who would be a small chapter of her life, as she learns about herself.\n\nThings would change of course for the both of them when Suzanne learned she was pregnant, four weeks along by the time she noticed herself. Part of her didn\u2019t want to believe it, to live in denial and that this was just a phase sounded so much more sweet to her than to know that this wasn\u2019t just a chapter, but the complete closing of the life before. She thought about an abortion for some time, but the thought of telling her parents the truth, of telling Norman the truth\u2026 She would freeze on the spot, her voice choked and almost always muttered out the same, \u201cit\u2019s all going to be fine.\u201d Perhaps Norman had already started to wear on her.\n\n*Maybe it was for the best that this chapter in life is starting so soon,* Suzanne reassured herself. There was no space for another philosopher in this world anyways, and if she was a stay at home mom, (the phrase sent shivers up her spine just to think it) then she would be able to write at her hearts content. She could imagine herself with a baby bobbing in one hand,\u00a0 her other hand resting on her keyboard. She didn\u2019t know what she wanted to say, what truths she needed to get out of herself, but perhaps with time she would know exactly what she felt. She felt bad for Norman as well- quitting his pursuit of writing his own book to find a well paying job, landing himself in an accounting office as an assistant for the time being. \u201cThere\u2019ll be plenty of room to move up in the company Suzanne, and after a few years, who knows, maybe I\u2019ll be an accountant too!\u201d Norman laughed at the image- he was never a numbers man.\n\nAfter nine months of debating back and forth of how she felt, whether to settle down and become a mother or run away and start a new life on her own, the decision came for her. Her water broke on a ride back from the theatres, and while the baby luckily stayed put until they reached the hospital, he was damn close to arriving in the back seat of Norman\u2019s beat up Daihatsu. He was born in June, on the same fateful Friday she first met the father.\n\nNorman Junior, a name they joked about but ultimately settled on. She wasn\u2019t terribly sure about that name.\n\n# [Part 5: One Page Down](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hv6nji\/one_page_down_norman_part_5\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1595247206.0,"comments":[{"author":"aftermine1","text":"Loving the backstory!","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1595276642.0}]},{"title":"Norman saves a life","author":"PaxSum","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hukiu2\/norman_saves_a_life\/","text":"It was a nice day today and Norman decided to go for a walk in the local park.

Maybe the red brick house at the end of the road. He would imagine working in the garden on a day like this. He would work in the sun, but when it would get too warm, the neighbors wife would invite him over for cold lemonade and home made cookies. Maybe the house could have an extra room, so Norman junior could come over and stay the night. \"He would like that.\" Norman thought to himself.\n\nNorman was so lost in thought that he almost did not notice a snail that was crossing the road. Norman stopped and watched how the snail slowly crawled across the sidewalk. \n\n\"This is not a good place to linger, mister Snail.\" Norman said, \"Someone might step on you!\" \n\nNorman tore a leaf off of the nearby tree and used it to gently pick up the snail. He took the snail to the little grass lane on the side of the sidewalk, where the snail continued their track towards the foliage by the road.\n\nNorman followed the snail for a few moments before continuing his own walk towards the park, now with a slight spring in his step. \"What an exciting day!\" Norman thought to himself, \"I can't wait to tell Norman about it!\"","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1595248746.0,"comments":[{"author":"jellysmoker","text":"Very sweet \u2763\ufe0f","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1595249103.0}]},{"title":"Norman & Suzanne go on a Date (Norman, Part 3)","author":"MattressCrane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hu0tzk\/norman_suzanne_go_on_a_date_norman_part_3\/","text":">[**Click here to go to the beginning!**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hsvfbm\/boy_meets_girl_norman_part_1\/)  \n>  \n>[**Click here for Part 2!**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hti695\/speed_dating_norman_part_2\/)\n\nThings had moved quickly for Norman that night. That little comment about how \u201cchill\u201d the speed dating was worked well for him, as it led to embarrassing himself and admitting to this stranger that he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing- either with love or with life- which led to her agreeing to much the same. \u201cSometimes I just ride the train and I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going,\u201d she admitted, moving a seat closer to Norman. The two liked talking to each other, laughing easy and striking it off remarkably well for two people who were complete strangers just moments before. They missed all the stops along the B line, including his place in the suburbs, and hers in the city. Neither wanted the conversation to end, and only left the train once it reached its final destination, a harbor near a small cluster of parks and pubs. She asked Norman if he\u2019d like to hang out and go for a late night walk, and he happily agreed.\n\nHer name was Suzanne, Suzie for short. A recent graduate from the same college Norman attended, she studied philosophy, literature, and preferred to read the classics, nothing much like Norman\u2019s preferred reading, but nonetheless it made Norman happy to know he had some things in common with her. Unfortunately over the course of the evening, Norman learned that there was some differences between the two- she was a dog person, and he was a cat person. She preferred Coca Cola, and he preferred Pepsi, if they had it. While there was a lot to make Norman feel deterred that she wasn't his soulmate, he reminded himself that it wasn't realistic that they'd be a perfect match from the start. She was nice to him, kind, listened to his banal complaints and treated him with respect when he spoke of progress on his book, *Womb of Eternity*.\n\nThe two eventually worked their way back to the train station, just in time to miss the final call for boarding by fifteen minutes. Norman, not one to be too forward, decided not to invite her over to his campus room. In fact Norman had never invited a woman back to his room, and figured that this was enough progress for one evening, even if he didn't want it to stop.\n\n\"Norman, would you like to stay at my place tonight? I live just a few blocks away from here.\"\n\nNorman stammered something that resembled a yes. Suzanne laughed, patting Norman on the back and leading the way.\n\nNorman saw her again the next week, and the week after that. After three months of happily dating, Norman was starting to think that that he would be content if he could spend the rest of his life with her, and he hoped that she felt the same way. Suzanne wasn't too sure what her future would entail- the thought of staying with Norman forever made her feel a little queazy, and she wasn't sure why. The answer for the queaziness became apparent after some weeks, as it was a surprise to both of them-\n\nSuzanne was pregnant.\n\n# [Part 4: Suzanne, Norman, and Junior](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/huk675\/suzanne_norman_and_junior_norman_part_4\/)","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1595166839.0,"comments":[{"author":"rawrr_monster","text":"Gasp!

It was a small, crowded bar with loud conversations, a hockey game blaring on the television that refused to quiet down, and when it came to the organization of the dating event, Norman felt like a nickel in a pocket full of change. There were dozens of men, all dressed near identical to himself. Blazers, hair gel and cologne dominated the room, and the few women who arrived looked just as disinterested in the conversations with the other men as well as the conversations they had with Norman.\n\n\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d a young woman in a blue dress asked Norman.\n\n\u201cAh, you know. Just chilling, I don\u2019t know. I, y\u2019know, just here to chill.\u201d\n\nNorman had never used the word chilling before. He didn\u2019t know why he felt that now was an appropriate time to start, and vowed to never say it again, but when he did eventually say it again to the next woman who asked him what he was doing here, and then again to the next, Norman decided that it was time to just head home and stop trying.\n\nRiding home on the train, Norman stared at his \u201cHello my name is NORMAN\u201d sticker that was starting to peel off his chest. He rolled one corner of the sticker up, and then tried to unroll it. Covered in lint, the sticker sprung back into its new form, never to return to its former glory again. Norman sighed. What a failure, he thought to himself, hanging his head low.\n\n\u201cWhat was the event?\u201d asked a woman sitting across from Norman, staring at his sticker.\n\n\u201cOh it was\u2026 It was a speed dating night at a pub.\u201d responded Norman.\n\n\u201cDid it go well?\u201d\n\nNorman looked up at the woman asking the questions. She was pretty, a young woman who looked a similar age to his own. She tucked her blond hair behind her ear, waiting eagerly for Norman\u2019s response. It dawned on Norman that he might be in love with this woman. It dawned on Norman that he needed to say something soon.\n\n\u201cIt was chill,\u201d said Norman.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Part 3: Norman & Suzanne go on a Date](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hu0tzk\/norman_suzanne_go_on_a_date_norman_part_3\/)\n\n&#x200B;","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1595085178.0,"comments":[{"author":"ExSalvation","text":"Damn, Norman be smooth.","upvotes":12,"created_utc":1595092422.0},{"author":"SeaActiniaria","text":"Aww","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1595141808.0}]},{"title":"Boy Meets Girl (Norman, Part 1)","author":"MattressCrane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hsvfbm\/boy_meets_girl_norman_part_1\/","text":"The year was 1995, a Friday in June, and Norman never felt more confident than he did today- and he needed to find even more confidence before tonight.

He was far too busy with homework all year round, as well as a high fantasy novel that he had been work-shopping\u2026 Those were really the only two notable events to happen to Norman during his years of college. He didn\u2019t want to admit it, but he was a quiet young man, comfortable and content with the silences of his evenings, but not content with how many there were. Norman was lonely.\n\nA romantic at heart, Norman toiled endlessly with the hopes of meeting someone he could fall in love with, a woman to sweep into his life, take him on grand adventures, someone to take him out of his shell and get into romantic antics with. Embarrassing themselves in a restaurant. Walking aimlessly in late night city streets, kissing in the rain, starting a family together, or even changing a tire in front of his father-in-law. It was all just a fantasy, much like his high fantasy novel, *Womb of Eternity*. He was very lonely indeed.\n\nThings were about to change for Norman forever, this Friday in June, in ways he never imagined his life going.

If he is to have a restful sleep, he can only do so knowing his mouth has been properly cleaned from the debris of the day\u2019s consumption. A flick of a switch light up the room and Norman scans the room, looking for the beginning of his next journey.\n\nHe reaches for his cup, a round glass with a heavy bottom, designed to hold precisely eight ounces of water from the tap. However, he would only need four ounces to brush his teeth. When done properly of course.\n\nNorman twists the knob of his sink. They were both clear crystal knobs, much like the ones that he used growing up in his childhood home. While they were unmarked, Norman knew the one on the right was the right would allow him access to cold water. Norman was quite proud of his memory in regards to the functionality of his sink. His give the knob a steady and confident quarter turn, and races the falling water with his glass cup, hoping his incredible speed would allow the cup to catch the water before it hit the drain. With a smile, he hears the familiar sloshing of water filling up his glass.\n\nOnce the glass was filled with the appropriate four ounces, (Norman eyeballed it, of course. His glass was not marked with fluid ounces, unlike the measuring up he used to make pancakes) he sets it down on the sink by the crystal knob designated for hot water. Luckily, Norman understood his sink quite well and knew his cold glass of water would not warm up simply by being near the hot water knob.\nNow that his cup had the appropriate amount of water. Norman needed to prepare his toothbrush with an appropriate amount of toothpaste. Norman gently reminded himself that toothpaste was not paste made from real teeth, but it was in fact a paste made for brushing teeth. His father had told him that joke as a child, but some jokes should not be told to impressionable children. Norman grimaces. Ah, father. Norman shakes his head and continues on his important task.\n\nNorman next needs his toothbrush. But where is it? Norman scans his bathroom. Normally he keeps it in the glass, for ease of access. But was it in the glass today? Ah! Norman raises his hand up and realizes he was holding it this entire time. An honest mistake. Filling a glass with water can sometimes become an enrapturing moment where one loses their focus. Norman examines the bristles on his toothbrush. The bristles were ever so slightly bent. He would need to replace them soon. Bristles must be firm if he is to execute a proper brushing technique to ward off plaque and gingivitis. But perhaps he shall continue on for today. It was getting a bit late and opening a pack of new toothbrushes carried with it a chance for a paper cut. Though the prospect of a paper cut seemed quite daunting, Norman steeled himself for the unexpected detour from his goal tonight. There is no room for shortcuts in dental hygiene, he thinks to himself.\nNorman reaches towards the side of his mirror and with a slight tug, opens the panel to reveal a shelf hidden in the wall. Such a fantastic invention, he thinks to himself. Norman spots his prize, a cardboard and plastic blister pack containing three tooth brushes. He looks down at his old tooth brush and thanks it for its months of service. \u201cThank you for all you have done for me.\u201d And he drops it into his bathroom waste bin.\n\nNorman reaches up to get his new toothbrush and holds the toothbrush blister pack in his hands. Three tooth brushes look back at him through a plastic covering. He could feel the perforations in the cardboard. These perforations are quite the breakthrough, he thinks to himself. Then he chuckles. A small joke. Breakthrough. Because it is perforated. He gives the pack a slight bend and watches as the cardboard flexes at the small cuts. Such a fine method to control the ever-chaotic process of opening cardboard packages. As Norman finishes bending the package open, his prize inside pops its bristled head out to greet him. Now for the deciding moment. Would Norman be able to retrieve the toothbrush without slicing his hand on the freshly torn cardboard? With utmost caution, Norman slides his fingers past the flaps of cardboard and wraps his fingers around the head. Delicately, but firmly, he pinches the head of the toothbrush and gently slides it out of the pack. After a tense second, he succeeds! Norman hold his new toothbrush triumphantly in his hand, ready to tackle the rest of the night\u2019s journey ahead of him. Norman places the pack with the remaining toothbrushes back on the shelf and closes his mirror.\n\nNow that Norman has a new toothbrush ready, he readies himself to apply the toothpaste. Norman reaches out and grabs his toothpaste. It is half empty. Or half full? He muses to himself. His eyes are drawn to the cap of the toothpaste. The kind that flips open, but can be unscrewed if desired. What would it be tonight? Norman recounts the many times the cap has fallen whenever he unscrewed it. But his instincts told him to unscrew the cap all the same. He had grown up using that particular method, and despite its shortcomings, he was most familiar with it. The cap required Norman to flip open the cap with a firm click, a sound that would startle him. Norman\u2019s eyes dart back to his new toothbrush. He had already done something new today. Why stop there? Perhaps to compliment the joyous moment of using a new toothbrush, Norman would confront his fear of the pop of the flipping cap. After all, he did brave the dangers of cardboard papercuts when he retrieved the toothbrush. What better way to commemorate an act of bravery with another? Norman readies himself and presses his thumb underneath the cap, steadily building up the pressure needed to flip it open. With a small pop the cap flips open and to his surprise, Norman did not flinch. He smiles to himself. He squeezes a pea size drop of toothpaste onto his tooth brush, closes the cap, and sets down the toothpaste onto the sink.\n\nNow with a dab of toothpaste on his toothbrush, Norman prepares himself to brush his teeth. Norman raises his toothbrush up to his teeth and begins a gently left to right motion. He counts ten lefts and ten rights and then moves onto the left side of his mouth. Once again, he brushes ten forwards and ten backwards. He opens his mouth and brushes the underside of his upper molars, then the back of his front teeth, then his right molars, repeating the process for his lower teeth. Once he completes brushing his teeth, he brings his cup up to his mouth and rinses he mouth. Norman continues with one more round of brushes, following the same pattern. He rinses one last time and spits into the sink. He looks up to the mirror and smiles, examining his work. \n\nNorman rinses his glass and sets it down in its usual place. He drops his toothbrush in the glass with a clink, and turns to leave his bathroom, flicking off the lights. He settles down in bed and closes his eyes, ready to go to sleep. But then he opens his eyes in realization.\n\nOh darn, Norman thinks to himself. I forgot to floss.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1594007761.0,"comments":[{"author":"banana_kiwi","text":"So good, so Norman.

He looked over to the left at his clock. It was midnight.  *What an ungodly hour to wake up to,* Norman thought. He was having a nice and quiet dreamless sleep up until now. *Perhaps some milk will sooth my nerves.*\n\nHe slid out of bed very slowly, careful to not wake Norman, his cat, who was sleeping right next to his feet; not at all disturbed by the thundering rain outside. Norman was a cranky cat when woken from his sleep and Norman did not desire one pestering him from the moment he woke up all the way till he fell back asleep. \n\nPerching on the side of the bed, Norman put on his slippers and headed out of the bedroom, though not without taking one more glimpse at Norman to make sure he was still asleep. He then headed downstairs to the kitchen, carefully opened the refrigerator and got the milk jug out. Norman checked the expiration date (still two weeks from now) before pouring a glass.\n\nNorman stood at the kitchen window observing the downpour of rain trench the ground, occasionally narrowing his gaze to take a sip of milk. There was something mesmerizing on how the rain washed over the earth. Though it was the reason for his early wake up, watching the storm now made Norman feel...relaxed. Norman felt a sense of calmness take over him that he attributed more towards to rain outside than the milk in hand.\n\nAfter a while Norman checked the time on his stove. It was 12:30. That sense of calmness within Norman was now slowly drifting his eyes shut, almost as if telling him it was alright to go back asleep. He accepted. There would be a busy day ahead of him tomorrow, well he supposed *today*, Norman thought.\n\nOnce Norman put the glass in the sink, he headed back to his bed where Norman was still sleeping peacefully. Discarding his slippers, Norman carefully slid back into the bed. His eyes tightened shut and Norman drifted back into a dreamless sleep with the sounds of wind and rain as his lullaby.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1593625961.0,"comments":[{"author":"SpacePisser","text":"So comfy.","upvotes":9,"created_utc":1593645957.0},{"author":"TNS01","text":"I really want some of that slow expiring milk","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1593684326.0},{"author":"banana_kiwi","text":"Norman seems to enjoy milk at night.\n\nHe is conflicted, because it calms and soothes him, but at the same time he fears that having milk residue in his mouth while he sleeps will cause it to turn sour and cause bad breath.\n\nTo combat this, he swishes his mouth with water after he drinks the milk and before going back to bed.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1594014756.0}]},{"title":"Norman Has An Important Day","author":"burner12332384885","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/hixry5\/norman_has_an_important_day\/","text":"Norman woke up the way he normally did, with Norman staring intently at him.

As he went to open the fridge for some milk, he took a look at his calendar, only to find that today\u2019s date had been marked by a star.\n\n*Perhaps it was a holiday?*\n\nAs he drove to work, the significance of the day continued to elude him, even as he ran through the possibilities.\n\n*Is there a new CSI on tonight?*\n\nPulling into his normal parking spot, Norman decided that whatever importance today held would soon be revealed. As he walked to his cubicle, he noticed a gathering in the kitchen. When he went in to investigate, he saw a half empty box of donuts in the center. Suddenly, Norman remembered that today was the day that the employees were receiving donuts for closing the big case last week. Norman politely waited until the other employees had gotten their preferred choice of donut, and then went for his favorite.

Time wasn't of any concern to him. Normally he'd be thinking about the next CSI episode, what meals he had to prepare for the week, if his car needed gas, or some other bother.

A small chocolate bar would be perfect. It was Friday after all and he hadn\u2019t treated himself in a while. \n\nHe headed out to the break room and stood in front of the large red vending machine. It was filled with a vast array of drinks and snacks. Scanning the rows, Norman\u2019s eyes stopped on the Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups.

But today, Norman had a couple things to pick up here and was rather intent on picking these two things up at the same time. Last time he was here - March - he purchased a rather uninteresting soft bristle tooth brush, and, according to the packaging from the Oral-B company - he was due for a replacement. As it turned out, Norman had exhausted his rather large bottle of Listerine, and consequently, was in the market for a new bottle as well. It pleased him that both these items had run their course around the same time, as that would mean Norman could purchase both dental hygiene products on the same trip.\n\n\n\"Two birds with one stone,\" he mused in his head.\n\n\nParticularly exciting was the options he had for his new products; this was rather uncharacteristic of Norman as usually he was a creature of habit. However, straying from the norm for these two products wouldn't be too risky and would help make his morning routine a little more interesting. However Norman hesitated upon first glance of the shelf lined with many mouthwashes from various different brands - each adorned with dazzling logos and wearing claims of their effectiveness with pride. Maybe this process would be harder than he imagined. Still, Norman pressed on; to begin, Norman singled out the Listerine brand - as he was confident in their offerings. Next he focused on those mouthwashes that claimed to primarily combat plaque, as this was Norman's major concern. Suddenly Norman felt more confident and began to enjoy this selection process. Finally, knowing that he wasn't feeling too adventurous, Norman eliminated all fruit flavors and arrived at deciding between original mint - the incumbent flavor- and extra fresh spearmint. He quickly reached for the newer flavor, the excitement was palpable in his heart now, and suddenly his mind shifted to how his co-workers might perceive this new scent - particularly Lisa.  Flushed, he brushed this thought aside and deposited the bottle of Listerine quickly into his cart.\n\n\n\"On to the next item,\" he instructed himself. Knowing how troublesome the prior engagement had been, Norman felt like perhaps the possibility of selecting a suboptimal toothbrush wasn't worth the risk. Reluctantly, Norman grabbed the same Oral-B soft bristle toothbrush as he did back in March - right down to the red and blue colored grip handle. He liked this brush, after all, there was a convenient tongue scraper built in and it was rather dependable. And just like that, the second item on his list was acquired and his shopping trip was coming to an end.\n\n\nHowever, just as Norman was about to leave,  he turned and saw a large picture sign hanging above the pharmacy section - a welcoming pharmacist handing a bag to a smiling older gentleman. And as luck would have it, Norman remembered that he needed to refill one of his medications as he would be running low soon. And as Norman turned around to approach the pharmacy, he chuckled to himself thinking,\n\n\"Three birds, one stone\"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1592970703.0,"comments":[{"author":"Sfn_y","text":"This is my first ever time writing a story, so I hope I didn't mess anything up or make it too boring","upvotes":18,"created_utc":1592973326.0},{"author":"cbartrip6","text":"Great job!

Norman checked the time on his phone. It was 9:32 am. *Quite early for the mailman. He usually comes at noon,* Norman thought as he stood and went to open the front door to his porch.\n\nNorman always waited until the mailman turned around the corner of his street  just in case they made a mistake in their deliveries. When the postman finally drove out of sight, Norman went to his mailbox and checked it wearily. It was summer and local mosquitoes had been quite active for the past few weeks. They seemed to take pleasure at popping out and latching onto Norman's skin in the afternoon when he went to get his mail and he had read online that they were quite active in the morning as well.\n\nLuckily there were none today and Norman enjoyed a contented walk back to the house with a few bills and a coupon offering in hand.\n\nWhen Norman came back up to his porch, he saw there was small but noticeable spider web in the left corner near his porch light.  On it was tiny common house spider weaving away at something, obviously up to no good. It was probably preparing to make its web larger and Norman had had quite enough bugs in his life as of late.\n\nFor a brief moment Norman raised the hand that he was holding his mail in, prepared to smack the web down. But then he noticed several large (in comparison to the spider) cocoons that the little arachnid had webbed up.  He took a closer look at what the spider was wrapping.

She had the kind of confidence never could find in his own life, as his own low threshold was what was keeping him from a law-breaking lifestyle. He's certainly never met anyone quite like her in his life, and if wasn't for the fact that she was forcing him to dine and dash, he probably never would have.\n\n\"Ernestine, I'm not sure. I don't think I can. If you want to do this it's your business, but I think I'll stay and cover the bill. I'm doing okay financially.\"\n\nNorman pulled out his wallet, placing it on the table. Ernestine predictably grabbed it immediately, shoving it into her purse. \"I'm going to use the bathroom Norman, then I'm going to wait outside at the bus stop. See you soon. I suggest you do the same.\"\n\nBefore Norman could think of what to say, the old woman stepped calmly away from her seat, heading towards the bathroom. A waiter stopped by and asked if everything was okay, and he desperately wished that the waiter could tell, based on Norman's beet-red face and pouring sweat, that he was being held hostage. \"All fine!\" Norman said loudly. Ernestine stepped out of the bathroom, giving one glance back to Norman- a signal in the form of slow swipe on her nose- and vamoose, she was out the door.\n\nHe was running out of time. It was only a matter of time before the bus arrived and Ernestine disappeared with his wallet, and perhaps only minutes away before the waiter circled around. Norman was out of food, and had nothing left to stuff his face with to avoid making excuses.\n\nStanding up from the table with his knees trembling, he walked as calmly as he could towards the doorway. The waiter at the front gave Norman a closed mouth smile before looking back down at the register, which was enough to cause Norman to abort his plan and slowly circle back towards the restaurant and hide in the bathroom.\n\nRound two, Norman did much better, dawning his sunglasses to hide his shameful eyes, and adopting a new strategy- he was going to cough his entire way out the doorway. No one could expect him to answer if he was in the midst of a coughing fit, and perhaps he just needed some air. Coughing and gagging all the way to the entrance, Norman gathered the attention of every person in the restaurant, the waiter who served his table quickly running to Norman's side to see if he was okay.\n\n\"Are you choking!? Do you need help?\" the waiter asked frantically, grabbing Norman's shoulder.\n\n\"No, I'm okay, thank you!\" Norman exhaled, exiting the door in the mass confusion he just caused. Running towards the bus stop, Norman made it just in time to get on the boarding bus, Ernestine laughing wildly as she watched from a window seat.\n\n\"Haha Norman, you're crazy! And you're stupid. I think they're coming for you.\"\n\nSweating and wheezing, Norman tucked behind Ernestine, hiding from the windows of the Olive Garden. While in deep fear at first, once the bus departed and she returned his wallet, Norman had a deep sigh of relief, and laughed in his exhilaration.\n\nNorman and Ernestine continued their chat as the bus continued along its route, Norman giving her a beat by beat breakdown of all the exciting moments he just experienced, and she laughed wildly at how worked up Norman was.\n\n\"Looks like this is my stop,\" said Ernestine. \"What are you up to tomorrow? Want to hang out?\"\n\nNorman nodded. \"Sure, why not!\"\n\n\"Hoppenheim park.

Norman was one of them, and Norman was also the only one of the eight that wasn't imaginary.\n\nIf he could help it, Norman liked to book as many tables as he could when he went to restaurants, to be sure that he would feel comfortable and not crowded as he tried his best to control his bad habit of eating with his mouth open, as well as receive some pity and pats on the back from the employees on the way out. If a waiter came by to ask when the rest of his party would be joining him, Norman would be sure to pack his mouth full so that he wouldn't be able to answer his question. Luckily enough, waiters and waitresses always seem to time asking him that question perfectly when he had food in his mouth already, so Norman never felt it was a challenge to keep up the ruse.\n\nA waiter began to walk towards his large table. Norman quickly began to stuff his mouth.\n\n\"Here you are, miss.\" said the waiter not to Norman, but an elderly woman- one that Norman had never met before in his life.\n\n\"Thank you sweetie,\" the old woman said to the waiter. \"Sorry, I'm late.\" she said to Norman. Norman's mouth was too full to tell the waiter he didn't know her, and soon after, the two were in it for the long haul.\n\nThe elderly woman that sat across from Norman stayed relatively quiet at first, as she busied herself trying to decide what to have from the menu.

Norman muttered his name, against the point he was trying to bring up-\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Ernestine Crane. I live over by the Value Village. Where\u2019s your address?\u201d\n\nNorman muttered his address, but intentionally didn\u2019t include his apartment number, in case he was making a dangerous mistake to trust her.\n\n\u201cDo you have a driver\u2019s license?\u201d asked Ernestine.\n\n\u201cErnestine, I\u2019d hate to have to ask you to move, but, I have company coming\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah? Like the last two times I saw you book a table for eight? If they show up I\u2019ll gladly move.\u201d\n\nNorman blushed and hung his head down to the tablecloth. Ernestine humphed.\n\n\u201cNorman, can I make you an offer you can\u2019t refuse?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t refuse?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the deal. My food is going to come, I\u2019m going to eat it. You\u2019re going to buy some, what are those called, some cheese sticks, because I think they\u2019re delicious and I don\u2019t want to have you watch me eat. Then, when we\u2019re done and they bring the bill... *vamoose*.\u201d\n\n\u201cVamoose?\u201d\n\nErnestine nodded as she violently hacked out some phlegm. \"*Dining and dashing*.\"\n\n\u201cErnestine I uh\u2026 If it\u2019s about money, I\u2019m happy to pay for both our meals, just this once.\u201d\n\nErnestine slapped her hand on the table, clipping Norman\u2019s spoon and sending it flying behind Ernestine\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s not about money. It\u2019s a rush, Norman, and you\u2019re going to do it whether you like it or not. I can fake a heart attack like it\u2019s no one\u2019s business. And you\u2019ll be sure that the last word I mutter is blaming you for killing me.\u201d\n\nNorman gulped, wiping the sweat forming at his brow. He saw enough episodes of CSI to know how this would turn out. Doing cocaine to prove he's not a cop. Shooting someone in the knee to prove he's not a cop. Declaring that he was not a cop, to test the myth that cops must always admit that they're officers of the law if asked directly.\n\nNorman was not a cop.

I'm reading the paper.\" He tries to act like this is a solemn ritual but Norman hasn't even actually read the paper from front to back, ever.

He grasps the tea bag tag, on the back it says \"Organic Sencha, Kyoto, Japan\". \"Hm.\"  Norman mumbles as he lets the tag fall against the cup, as if the tag was too hot to touch. He takes out the tea bag exactly two minutes later. He places his mug right on the newspaper as he has no plans to read it further. Soon a big mug stain forms on the sheets, blurring the text. \n\n*Later in the day*\n\n\"Norman! Time for your treat!\" Norman exclaims to Norman lazing about on the newspaper on the kitchen table. He pours out a turkey treat on it, watching as Norman chews and licks the treat against the wet newspaper.

One or two drops of creme was all that could be found.

Each night before CSI aired, he would watch the news. Or more accurately, avoid watching the news, his eyes averted from the screen, focused on the daily sudoku or crossword instead. The news was filled with horrible things, rising coronavirus counts, death counts, images of police brutality, and protestors getting tear-gassed. It was a lot for Norman to take in, every single night, every single day.\n\nSince quarantine had started Norman had been working from home, strictly adhering to quarantine rules and only going out once a week to his local grocery store. And always with a mask. Sometimes at night, if he was feeling particularly cooped up, he'd take a short walk around the neighborhood. Sometimes Norman would even accompany him.\n\nIt wasn't that different from his life before quarantine, and yet, it felt very different. He felt much heavier. Both around his waistline, probably from the donuts he kept seeing on sale at the grocery store, and from the world around him.\n\nNorman was watching the news once more, waiting for CSI to appear and whisk him away into a world of flashy, fun, forensics, murder, intrigue, passion, and friendship. But until then, the news.\n\nIt was heavy, as it always was these days. Focused on the protests and riots that were breaking out around him. Norman felt very bad over these things, a sinking, weight settling in his gut as he watched the crowds across the country march for recognition and a desire to be seen, heard, acknowledged.\n\nLoved.\n\nLater that night, lying in bed with Norman curled up at his feet, Norman thinks about how often he feels all those things the protestors feel at work. But that's just at work, not his entire life. He wants to help. But he doesn't know how. He doesn't want to impose, to take away their voices, to drown them out. And he is certain he would only make a mess of things if he attempted to join a rally. He cringes, thinking of a tubby, middle-aged man like him trying to walk amount all those young, impassioned, brave kids. He falls asleep that night, tossing and turning, and wakes the next morning feeling like he hadn't slept at all.\n\nDuring his lunch break, which Norman has timed to match exactly what it was when he was in the office, Norman gets a call from Norman Jr. \n\n\"Just checking in Dad.\" Norman Jr. says, it's always nice to hear his voice. They have a short chat, Norman is on the clock of course, and as casually as he can, Norman mentions the news.\n\nNorman Jr. listens quietly and then tells his father that he'll email him something that might help. They say their customary goodbyes and Norman gets back to work.\n\nOnly after he's clocked out for the day, moving from his home office to his couch, does Norman bother checking his personal email. Waiting there, the only email he'd gotten in weeks, is the message from Norman Jr. \n\nIt's a list of books that he could read to help educate him about race in America. And a list of organizations he can donate too if he wants to help.\n\nNorman puts the news on in the background while he waits for CSI and carefully picks a few organizations, donating twenty dollars to each. Then he writes down the names of the books Norman Jr. sent him on a scrap of paper. \n\nTomorrow he'll stop by the local bookstore owned by the nice black couple down the street who have a cat who looks a bit like Norman and pick up these books.\n\nNormal knows that what he's doing is very small, but he also knows he's trying.

It was cold when he poured it, but it had probably warmed to room temperature since then. The allure of a lukewarm cup of water was too much to resist, so Norman sat down and had a sip. It was delicious and refreshing, and Norman breathed a sigh of contentment. The TV had been left on, and Norman noticed that two episodes of CSI were set to run back-to-back. \n\n\"Well, that's OK,\" he thought. \"I can go on a walk a different day.\"\n\nNorman picked up Norman to give him a pat, and decided to snuggle in for a mini CSI marathon.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1591696316.0,"comments":[]},{"title":"Norman becomes an author","author":"Yinxi","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/gz20sl\/norman_becomes_an_author\/","text":"Norman felt his belly flutter as he walked to his mailbox. He just knew it this morning when he woke up: today would be the day. He opened the mailbox and took out the local newspaper.\n\nHe could hardly restrain himself, but managed to not peek. Quickly he took it inside and sat down at his table, where his favorite big mug of coffee was already waiting for him. \"Thank you, Norman. You're welcome, Norman,\" he joked to himself before taking a sip, chuckling at his own little joke. Norman lifted his head from his napping spot on the windowsill in acknowledgment.\n\nAfter reading the front page, checking if there were any good coupons, and scanning the obituaries for familiar names he finally arrived at the highly anticipated part of his daily newspaper-reading process: the column by Jacques Flappeau, The Fanciest Pidgeon of the Town.\n\nFor several years now Norman enjoyed reading about Jacques' ordinary but special life every day. However, for the last week Jacques had not been appearing on his usual spot at the bottom left of page 5. Norman's gut feeling this morning had been wrong, because today as well Jacques was nowhere to be seen.\n\nNorman considered ringing to the newspaper to ask what had happened to Mr. Flappeau, but he thought they would probably find him quite silly. \"Norman, can't you write something about your life for me to read?\" He asked his buddy. He did not get a response.\n\nThen an amazing idea hit him. He would write a piece himself! He took up the pen and notebook from their place next to his telephone and started working.\n\n10 minutes later, he had a masterpiece about Jacques stealing some crumbs of bread from the local ducks. Satisfied with himself, he decided that he could do this every day until Jacques returned to him.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1591632023.0,"comments":[{"author":"FatGordon","text":"Well done, I did misread the title as Norman becomes an Auror.

The only active time he\u2019d otherwise engaged in was weeding the tomato plants and facilitating a quick game of \u201cswat the yarn\u201d with Norman. \n\nHe\u2019d watched a lot of sports, a couple buddy-comedies, and eaten two big bowls of strawberry ice cream when he decided to turn in for bed. \n\nHe rinsed his dishes and admired his newly emptied recycling, glad to have the task done for the remainder of the week. \n\nHe straightened the magazines on his coffee table, considering recycling the old issue of \u201cLawn Maintenance Quarterly\u201d, but deciding to wait until the new issue arrived before doing so. He was still basking in the pride of his empty recycling bin, after all.  \n\nHe shook a bit more food into the bowl for Norman, in case he got hungry for a snack during the night, and flicked the lights off one by one as he passed them on his way to bed. \n\nHe looped back around to ensure the pet door was closed, and it was. Norman had long since come indoors. \n\nNorman started the water in the shower so that it would be hot when he stepped in. Meanwhile he used a squirt of his favorite body lotion, cucumber melon. \n\nHe took a nice, warm, unhurried shower. He even used an exfoliating soap on top of his regular soaping routine. \n\nThen he brushed his teeth, flossed, used his water pick, rinsed with mouthwash, and took his nightly pill. He had recently switched to a lavender colored mouthwash instead of the navy colored one, and he found it a much more pleasant aftertaste. \n\nHe toweled completely dry and selected one of his favorite pajama combinations, a two-sizes-too-big shirt from his college roommate\u2019s bachelor party eleven years ago, and grey sweatpants he buys in packs of three at the Dollar Cove. \n\nHe sank into bed, enjoying the familiarity of his mattress, and let the sheets settle delicately over him. Norman found his way to the foot of the bed, familiar by now with the evening routine. \n\nNorman selected one of the three books he had going on his nightstand. Since he was in no rush, he picked *An Adventure Through Moscow With Friends and Acquaintances*, a heart-stopping adventure book with long chapters that Norman couldn\u2019t bear to set down partway through. \n\nHe so enjoyed this portion of the story, in which the travelers had made it out of their latest conundrum unharmed, that he indulged in reading two chapters. \n\nHe even considered a third, but Norman\u2019s soft purring coupled with the even pattering of light raindrops against the back windowpane coaxed his eyes closed. He set his sunflower page-marker in his spot and placed the book carefully on the bedside table, a safe distance away from the cold water he had prepared for himself in case he woke up thirsty during the night. \n\nHe pulled the chain on the stained glass light fixture his sister had gotten as a housewarming present but later regifted to him because she felt it looked too much like a pub lamp. Norman was glad she did, as it matched his wallpaper, and he thought it was perfectly fine. He enjoyed pulling the chain and listening for the *click* two seconds before the bulb sputtered into darkness. He looked forward to it every night. \n\nHe couldn\u2019t wait to wake up to greet the next day, so he could watch sports, eat ice cream, play cards, or use his scented body wash again. He felt lucky to lead a life with so many daily joys. \n\nNorman wrapped his arms around the adjacent pillow and let the sound of the rain and the smell of the freshly cut grass lull him into a deep, restorative slumber.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1590997532.0,"comments":[{"author":"Danisonic","text":"I don't know if this is against the rules, but your writing is fucking amazing.

Type in a few sentences to HAIMKE and let it generate a full-fledged story. We released it today. Show us what you create with it #madewithhaimke on Twitter. Thanks!\n\n\"Twenty-eight years old, Norman had grown up. He was as clear as day, Norman's life will never be the same again. His parents, both in their twenties and thirties, had given up alcohol, and he and his sister tried to make it straight as they struggled to get to school. Things did not go so well, Norman thought. The world had stopped being Norman; he and his sister tried very hard to get to school, and was not allowed to go to class; life had gone terribly wrong.\n\nAs a young man, when the going got tough, Norman tried to support himself. He went to the bank and then had coffee to go. And finally, he did not drink anymore. Not for him, not for fame, not for money - no, Norman did all this work to get his face straight (and then to earn the money he earned for it; and by the way, he lived it all with that passion).\n\n\n \n \nNorman took a deep breath, he was finally happy. And when he sat down again, he could see his face. It was as if, at that moment, a special recognition was waiting for him. That was when they first hugged and that's how it went. It was as if the whole world knew Norman had left it that he could never be happy again.\"\n\nIt was as clear as day, Norman's life will never be the same again. His giddy, feverish wonderment was the only thing keeping him from finishing up the first shave. Even his therapist was telling him that the only way to clear his hump was to get on with his day, Norman. Midnight would be the sweet hour, the sunrise zipping past, the darkness mousing over him.\n\n\"I hate to tell you the truth,\" he said to himself. \"Every moment is worth it.\" He paused to let his eyes drift behind his long nose. He went to the bank and then had coffee to go. He went to the bathroom and drank water, looked back at himself smugly, \"I've been living an amazing, amazing life! I've got forty years of experience and I just got to give it up and let these feelings of joy and fun trip over my head again!\"\n\nNorman took a deep breath, he was finally happy. That was because he could let it go and not let it stop him. He no longer felt trapped in a machine thinking, \"Oh, my gosh; I'm just gonna have to clean this machine for me now.\" As his mind wandered the various aspects of his life that felt like it weighed heavily on him, it was clear there was more than just happy for him. He was sad.\n\nhttp:\/\/haimke-static.ai21.com\/html\/dc587776ef234500bc22f5ccd1b5fb05.html","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1591011791.0,"comments":[{"author":"crimsonrhodelia","text":"Upvoted for \u201cthe darkness mousing over him\u201d.","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1591929089.0}]},{"title":"Norman Bounces Norman on his Knee","author":"MattressCrane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/gsj4ty\/norman_bounces_norman_on_his_knee\/","text":"With a record setting twenty days inside, Norman was growing restless without the ability to travel his neighborhood freely.

Norman plopped into his recliner once again, scooping up his cat onto his lap before she could slip away.\n\nShe loved to be placed on top of his knee and bobbed up and down, like a small child. Norman never minded doing it, so long as she was purring and happy. It was a game Norman played many years ago, when Junior was just a baby. *That kid would fall right asleep after that,* Norman thought to himself, fondly.\n\nNorman wondered how his son was doing. A funny image came to his head, of what it would be like to bounce a fully grown Junior on his knee instead of a toddler.

It gave him something to look forward to and helped him to manage the feelings of isolation that came and went on a regular basis. \n\nCooking from scratch was another activity that Norman had found enjoyable during this time. The lack of commute to and from his job meant that Norman could invest a little extra time in preparing his meals and he had tried out several new recipes recently - some with a degree of success. \n\nSaturday had rolled around again and Norman had decided to try his hand at making cat treats using a recipe he had found online. He had added the ingredients that he would need to his weekly shop, including a fillet of fresh salmon and a small, fish shaped cookie cutter. \n\nIt had taken him most of the afternoon to prepare the biscuit base, cut out all the tiny shapes, lay them on a baking sheet, cook them at the correct temperature and for the recommended time and set them on a cooling rack once they had come out of the oven. \n\nNorman hadn\u2019t realised just how many treats the recipe would make, so he had to repeat the steps multiple times for a total of four baking sheets. \n\nHaving finally finished both the cooking and the clean up, Norman felt a sense of pride at the large screw top jar filled with homemade cat treats that was sitting on his kitchen counter. These would last Norman a long time! Even though the treats had worked out to be more expensive than Norman\u2019s usual brand, the activity had helped to pass the time and, after all, a spoiled cat was a happy cat. \n\nNorman opened the jar and shook a few of the fish shaped treats into Norman\u2019s bowl. He was looking forward to seeing the cats reaction to his labour of love. Placing the bowl on the floor, he didn\u2019t need to wait long for the hungry cat to arrive. \n\nBrushing past Norman\u2019s legs, the cat approached the bowl. He looked at the contents and leaned forward to sniff the small biscuits. Norman looked up, confused as to what was in his bowl. His tail twitched, which was never a good sign, and he stalked out of the kitchen looking insulted. \n\nNorman sighed heavily, removed the offending biscuits from the bowl and refilled it with Norman\u2019s usual brand. \u201cCats!\u201d he muttered to himself as he emptied the jar into the trash.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1588502077.0,"comments":[{"author":"Valen_02","text":"Awww poor Norman!","upvotes":12,"created_utc":1588522741.0},{"author":"pygame","text":"Happy cake day","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1589605911.0}]},{"title":"The hummingbird feeder","author":"lordperiwinkle","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/gblvc6\/the_hummingbird_feeder\/","text":"Norman rummaged about in his small garden shed until he found his two hummingbird feeders, one the basic plastic model, and the other made by a pottery that he and his ex-wife had bought decades ago at an art-in-the-park show.

It was a large area with hundreds of people zipping by and a group of activists engaging any passerby. Norman proceeds and tries to avoid eye contact. To his surprise, people were yielding to him! The activists had found other people to distract. With a sigh of relief, Norman firmly kept his stride. \n\n*8:20 A.M.*\n\nThe next train was scheduled to leave, but the doors remained open. Norman was worried. There was roughly thirty feet of ground to cover. To make his transfer, he would have to do it. Norman, as fast as he could without sprinting, clutches his backpack and runs. Simultaneously, the doors started to close. Right before they could shut, Norman propels his right-hand forward between the doors, preventing it from closing. The train conductor noticed and re-opens the doors. Norman steps inside and catches his breath. The onlooking commuters nodded approvingly. As the train begins to depart, Norman turns and gazes at the reflection in the door window. His face lightens.\n\nHe still looked presentable.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1587623493.0,"comments":[{"author":"PianoVampire","text":"Delightful!

Today is Sunday, Norman\u2019s favorite day. The weather is warm, but the sky is a bit overcast which Norman believes is just the right kind of weather. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Norman loves the warmer seasons, but when it\u2019s too sunny he worries about getting sun burned.\n\nThe hustle and bustle of Norman\u2019s normally sleepy town has made Norman feel like a new man this weekend. Last week the CDC announced a new vaccine to combat COVID - 19. Quarantine, stay at home orders, and other precautions finally melted away after what felt like years of Norman being cooped up in his home. Norman had cleaned every nook and cranny, organized all of his drawers, and watched so much CSI that he briefly considered a career in law enforcement before deciding it would be much too strenuous. \n\nNorman was so excited after the good news that he went out to the grocery store on Friday to make a special dinner: sliced up hot dogs and boxed macaroni and cheese. He even picked up a new type of cat food for Norman to enjoy: sweet potato and turkey. Norman dug in and even allowed Norman to sit at the table while they both enjoyed their special meals. After dinner, Norman fell asleep curled up in Norman\u2019s lap as Norman watched the game show network for a change of pace.  \n\nAlthough he didn\u2019t think it possible, Saturday was even more of a nonstop thrill ride for Norman.  As he went about his errands at the local shopping mall, it seemed that every single person was in the best mood. Every couple he passed by, every teenager, every employee smiled brightly and offered polite greetings to Norman. This put Norman in such a good mood that he treated himself to several new pairs of his favorite tube socks, and a soft pretzel at the food court. \n\nAs Norman sat on his favorite bench, in his favorite park, with his favorite weather, watching the world go by he couldn\u2019t help but feel appreciative. He watched couples laugh and joke, watched families enjoying picnics in the park, and children playing. As Norman settled into bed later that evening, he mused that the Universe had seemingly granted Norman\u2019s every desire this weekend, but Norman had just one more wish. As Norman curled up between his legs purring, Norman turned out the light, closed his eyes, and wished that every day could be this splendidly average.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1586011085.0,"comments":[{"author":"PianoVampire","text":"Beautiful.

In the past, such occurrences were infrequent, and rarely lasted longer than a week, but they were extremely enjoyable.  Norman's owner would play games with him and shower him with affection, and would usually leave an extra treat or two in Norman's food bowl as well.\n\nThis event was different, for reasons Norman was not capable of understanding. It had been three weeks since his owner had started staying home. And Norman had found that, whereas typically his owner would putter around the house to keep himself busy in the past, his owner had instead chosen to shut himself into the \"office\" room for nearly the entire day, almost as long as he would be gone if he had left in his car. His owner only occasionally came out to eat, and serve Norman's food as well. Norman was baffled by the realization that his owner smelled like \"work\" stress at the end of the day, despite not actually going to \"work.\"\n\nHis master's routines had changed in other ways as well. He no longer took the car out on Sunday to buy food. Instead, Norman found that strange humans were using their cars to bring food to them. On one hand, Norman felt an odd sense of pride in the idea that humans were bringing him and his owner gifts, as they should have done long ago. But the more rational part of his brain knew that his owner's hunting skills had always been slightly underdeveloped, and this new development would surely not help matters.\n\nNorman felt that the change in his master's behavior was beginning to have an effect on his own. He spent less time outside patrolling the neighborhood, opting to stay indoors and wait for his master to exit the \"office\" room. But this increased fretting had done nothing to change his owner's behavior. Finally, just after lunchtime one day, Norman decided it was time to make a change. If his owner wasn't going to go out during the day, he may as well spend his time doing something useful, like giving Norman belly rubs.\n\n***\n\nNorman entered the last few words of his report and saved the file. He was just on time for the afternoon video conference his boss had scheduled. He opened the application on his computer and adjusted his new webcam, making sure his face was properly displayed on the screen. He frowned slightly. His face always looked a bit washed out in the video, and he wasn't sure if it was because of the camera or the lighting in the room. He quickly stood up and adjusted the blinds behind his computer screen. This made the video slightly better.\n\nThe video conference went by at a meandering pace. Each member of the office submitted a brief statement on what progress they had made on the week's work. The work itself had dwindled a bit since the quarantine had begun, and was presenting itself sporadically at best. Norman's boss had done his best to equally divide what few tasks remained among the employees.\n\nJust before Norman gave his own information, he heard a loud, insistent scratching noise at the door. He glanced briefly to the side.\n\n\"Norman? Is there an issue?\" his boss asked.\n\nNorman blinked. \"No sir. It's just my cat.\" The scratching continued.\n\n\"Aw, can we see him?\" asked Lisa.\n\n\"Um\u2026\"\n\n\"I didn't know you had a cat, Norman,\" said Fahim.\n\n\"I'm sure I've mentioned him.\" More scratching.\n\n\"You can let the cat in, Norman. Be quick.\"\n\n\"Oh. Well, alright then.\" \n\nNorman did as his boss asked and walked over to the door. Immediately upon opening it, his cat dashed in and leapt up the side of the bookcase, coming to rest at the top where some old airplane models where gathering dust. Norman's coworkers had a clear view of the cat through his webcam, and complimented it appropriately. Norman, however, was slightly miffed that his cat had chosen to rest among the fragile models.\n\n\"Norman, please come down from there.\"\n\nThe cat did not respond. Norman frowned and returned to his desk.\n\n\"Anyway,\" his boss continued. \"Norman, you were saying?\"\n\n\"Yes, I didn't have any trouble with the report. I submitted it just before the meeting started\u2014\"\n\n\talkrity%^&JKl;sdfalllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll\n\t\nNorman had not noticed that his cat had dropped down from the bookcase as he was speaking. Now it was laying on the keyboard, sending random strings of text to the video conference chat function. Its tail flicked back and forth across the webcam. Norman stared down blankly.\n\n\"What's gotten into you?\"\n\n\"Well, that's all I needed to hear, anyway.\" Norman looked up to see his boss on the screen. \"Not much has been going on. Everyone who's finished with their work can take the rest of the week off. With pay, of course. I'll let you know by email if anything else needs doing.\"\n\nThe meeting ended shortly after. The cat glanced briefly at the screen as the image changed, then back to Norman. It rolled over slightly, and stretched its paws.\n\nNorman gave him a belly rub.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1585975599.0,"comments":[{"author":"no_talent_ass_clown","text":"It's good to hear about Lisa again.","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1586014196.0}]},{"title":"Norman has a fever","author":"twoshortdogs2019","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/funca2\/norman_has_a_fever\/","text":"Norman woke with a start. He felt anxious and his heart was beating quite quickly. Taking a few deep breaths Norman realised that he had woken from a nightmare. \n\nHe tried to remember what he had been dreaming about, but the details seemed just out of reach of his conscious mind. There were quick flashes, but nothing solid that Norman could grasp. The apartment, his cat, a fire. Fire! Norman leapt out of bed and did a quick circuit of the small apartment, his heart racing now. Everything was fine. But Norman was hot. Much hotter than usual. So hot that he was, in fact, sweating. \n\nNorman headed to the bathroom and opened the medicine cabinet. He took out the digital thermometer and sighed heavily. This could be it. The virus that was dominating the news and the reason why everyone was social distancing, Norman included. He slipped the thermometer under his tongue and waited tentatively for the results. \n\nIt was Thursday morning and Norman had been working from home this week. He idly wondered what the process was for calling in sick when you weren\u2019t intending to go to the office anyway. He also considered the potential consequences should he have the virus and began to recount the people that he had recently been in contact with. The list wasn\u2019t long, but before Norman could finish the thermometer beeped. \n\nFeeling more than a little apprehensive, Norman lowered his eyes and read the small screen. It confirmed that he did, indeed, have a fever. \n\nHe felt his anxiety levels rising again and headed back to the bedroom in search of Norman. The cat always had a calming influence on him, and it wouldn\u2019t do to add a full blown panic attack to his already mounting troubles. \n\nCurled in a ball, the cat was still snoozing, oblivious to Norman\u2019s abrupt departure. Norman sank down onto the bed, reaching for his faithful friend. As he did, he noticed how warm the bed felt. Not warm - positively hot. \n\nNorman leaned over the side and saw that the light on the switch for his electric blanket was glowing red. He must have fallen asleep last night with the blanket on high. Switching the dial to the off position Norman reset the thermometer and popped it back in his mouth. He was feeling somewhat hopeful at the beep this time which turned to overwhelming relief when the display showed that his temperature was already returning to within the normal range. \n\nThere was a big smile on Norman\u2019s face as he headed to the kitchen to start breakfast. He thought that he might email his work colleagues later, just to check in and see how they were doing. They might even laugh at the amusing story that he had to tell them. Norman mewed loudly at his feet, demanding his own breakfast.

He liked the feel of water falling on him, liked to feel clean afterwards, but, most importantly, he liked to sing. And the shower was the only place where he could sing without any judgments. A safe space for his terrible voice. \n\nThe water took some seconds to heat and, while he waited, Norman took off his clothes and looked himself in the mirror. He was a bit chubby. Norman poked his belly and sighed. That was it! He was going to the gym tomorrow. After feeling a bit bad about his weight, Norman stepped inside his shower, ready for his improvised karaoke to begin. \n\nFirst, he had to pick a song. He didn't know a lot of songs by heart so his singing sessions usually consisted of the same two songs, Mambo No. 5 and Wake Me Up Before You Go Go, over and over again. \n\nHe started to sing and, as the singing progressed, Norman felt his body move. His shower was small and cramped, but Norman still danced inside it. He imagined himself on a stage, with a huge audience cheering him up. Norman got a shampoo bottle and pretended it was a microphone. He was glad no one could see him. His cat was also locked out of the bathroom because he didn't want anyone watching him, not even Norman, the cat. \n\nFinally, Norman started to get tired. How long had he been in there? Not too long, he imagined. But Norman was wrong. It had been too long. Almost half an hour of repreasing the same songs. His body was red from the hot water and his fingers all wrinkled. Only when he noticed that, Norman decided it was time to get out. He took exactly seven minutes to finish washing. \n\nNorman wrapped the towel around his waist and opened the bathroom door, releasing all the steam from the shower to the outside world. He really needed to spend less time in there. Norman told himself that on the next shower he wouldn't sing nor dance, he wouldn't waste any more time with that.

As he took the plastic tray out the box and punctured the film over its top with a fork, he was beset by a disturbing thought.  \n\nHe was eating a frozen *dinner*. For *lunch*.  \n\nNorman shuddered internally. The lockdown had changed him. This wouldn\u2019t have happened had he still been able to go into the office. He looked down at Norman, who let out a plaintive mew.  \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said to the cat, \u201cI need to make a change.\u201d Heart swelling with determination, Norman pulled out his phone and opened the app store.  \n\nNorman\u2019s son had always suggested that he try ordering groceries, but Norman never really got around to it.

It couldn\u2019t be helped, though; Norman didn\u2019t want to risk getting sick. Desperate times called for desperate measures. He downloaded the delivery app and tapped in his account details.  \n\nA few minutes later, and Norman was scrolling through his options. He mulled over his options before recreating his favorite shopping list in the app: two loaves of bread, a couple packs of lunch meat, some  singles of American cheese, a 12-pack of diet soda and enough frozen food to get him through a couple weeks. As he went to submit his order, he paused. It was a lockdown.

Social distancing meant that Norman had been working from home recently and while he was mostly enjoying the change of pace he felt it important to maintain his key routines during this time. \n\nNorman had been making sure to wake up at his usual time, get dressed in his work clothes, eat his breakfast in the kitchen with Norman and make his lunch, which he ate during his 30 minute break at midday.  He allowed himself an extra cup of coffee after breakfast - time that he would usually spend travelling - and was at his makeshift desk (the small Formica dining table) ready to switch on his laptop at five to nine. \n\nWork was over for the day, however, and Norman was hungry. Fortunately Norman had stocked up on the essentials before social distancing and his refrigerator was looking unusually full. Of course he had also stocked up on Norman\u2019s favourite cat food, along with a few small treats. \n\nNorman usually had sausages on a Tuesday, with mashed potatoes and peas, but today he felt like a change. Reaching into the pantry he pulled out a sachet of instant gravy which he stirred into a cup of boiling water and drizzled over his sausages. \n\nAfter cleaning up the dinner dishes and feeding Norman, they both settled down on the sofa to watch an episode of CSI.

Norman asked if this was safe, and the CDC representative said it was mostly safe, but mostly still in development. They even offered to pay him for it. Norman decided it was for the best, as he didn't want to get COVID-19.\n\nIn another week, Norman drove to a health clinic in order to get his vaccine. He carefully parked his car in the parking lot, then entered the building. There was little traffic, most likely due to the pandemic. He checked in, and waited for a few minutes in the waiting room. Norman read a magazine to pass the time.\n\nWhen his name was called, Norman got up and went into a doctor's office with a nurse. The nurse asked him some questions while preparing the vaccine. When they were finished, a doctor was called in to administer the vaccine. The doctor instructed Norman to stay still, and uncover one of his elbows. He then gave the vaccine to Norman.

After the segment, Norman had a craving for Chinese take-out, and searched the internet for nearby restaurants.  However, before he could dial, Norman remembered he had just eaten a meal, and would have to save the adventure for another day.  \n\nThe following night, Norman remembered that Chinese people would be celebrating the new year for at least the rest of the week, though he could not remember why.  Norman smiled, as this meant he had all week to plan his trip to the restaurant.  Norman ate some peas and carrots and went to bed.  \n\nNorman thought it would be a nice gesture to wish the restaurant staff a happy new year, and an even nicer gesture to do it in Chinese.  But when Norman searched for translations on his computer, he was horrified.  There were popular examples for both Mandarin and Cantonese.  Panicking, Norman had no idea which he should use at the restaurant.  Norman thought about this, and breathed a sigh of relief.  He would learn both phrases.  It was another good night for Norman.  \n\nNorman practiced *'Gong xi fa cai'* and *'Gung hay fat choi'* in front of the bathroom mirror every night for the next three nights.  \n\nThe day arrived.

Looking more closely at the menu, Norman realized dishes from many regions of China were available.  He could not decide which phrase to use with the clerk.

To me, you are a friend, but to you I am invisible. I cannot remember when I first saw you but when I see you now it\u2019s like reconnecting with an old friend. I\u2019ve lived across the courtyard from you for the past two years and watching your life unfold was special--not in an axe-killer kind-of-way, but in an adoring way\u2026 the same way you\u2019d watch a drunk friend on a dance floor.* \n\n*From across the courtyard, I\u2019ve watched you pet your cat in front of the TV a million and one times. I\u2019ve watched you spill TV dinners on yourself and then proceed to let your cat clean it up. When you leave for work, like a dog, I would sit around and await your return home.* \n\n*Finally, my wife became a devout follower too.*\n\n*Together, we laughed as you attempted to spray paint your balding head\u2026 and the ensuing mess of cleaning the over-spray. When you weren\u2019t home, we watched your cat sit in the window. We watched as the arms of your couch continually scratched to tatters.  My wife loved that you ordered the same food every Friday evening. With the exactitude of a priest conducting Mass, we watched you ritualistically move from the kitchen to your couch, and eventually fell asleep halfway through your meal. We started tallying the number of times you broke your Friday routine\u2014seven, in the two past years, if you\u2019re curious. We watched you yell at the kids in the courtyard for making too much noise, while you watched movies for the fourth or fifth time.*\n\n*And then she got sick.* \n\n*For a while, we had to forget about you. Between doctor appointments, hospital stays, family visits, the myriad of insurance phone calls and bills\u2026you were relegated to just another window in the canvas of the city.*\n\n*We cried along with you when you watched Marley and Me, time after time.* \n\n*When she could no longer move around the house, confined to our bed, unable to see you from our window, she wanted daily updates on your activities. I began to watch you with new eyes, a new intensity, looking for any new update I could give her. Anything. A sneeze. You broke your glasses one morning and for three days it was all we could talk about. When I told her that you attempted to use literal coke bottles to see and nearly stepped on your cat, she howled until the laughter became a long and painful bout of coughing.*  \n\n*But, by and large, you were the steady roar of a waterfall. Through you, we became closer. Through you, we cherished ever present moment.*\n\n*We toasted to you on New Years Eve, though you were long asleep. By then she could barely lift the glass.* \n\n*One evening I came to meet you, to ask you to come over, and meet my wife\u2014I made it all the way to your door\u2026 but I could hear you talking to your cat. The murmur of the TV in the background. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to knock. I didn\u2019t want to interrupt the serenity, be the boulder in the stream waterfall.* \n\n*In those final weeks, you were everything. You were the unoccupied seat at the dinner table and the unfinished wine glass while we watched TV. You were our constant\u2014the solitary point of continuity that we relied on every day. No phones, no social media, no distractions, just the two of us and you.* \n\n*On the morning she passed away, you must have missed your bus to work because you stayed home and simply stared out the window. I would like to believe you helped usher her passage. You, whose name I never knew, built the stepping stone for my wife to move on.*\n\n*I cannot live in this place any longer without thinking about her, but before I leave, I wanted you to know what you meant to us.*\n\n*I do not know what comes next, there is some solace in not knowing\u2014but I do know that you remain as a monolith.* \n\n*Thank you,*\n\n*From across the courtyard*\n\nAs Norman finished the letter, he walked to the window and peered outside. The sun outside was too bright and he squinted down into the courtyard where he saw the children playing. The ding of the microwave, snapping him out of his gaze, signaled his leftovers were ready.

He clasped it tight into a fist and buried it beneath his left armpit. He'd been to his doctor the week before. She was concerned and wanted him to go for follow-up examinations.\n\nWhen it had first started Norman dismissed it as being over-worked at his job. His bosses had a not-so-secret policy of pushing their employees to work as much overtime without compensation as possible. Norman just assumed it was all catching up with him. Perhaps a spot of annual leave was what he needed.\n\nInstead, Norman decided not to work over a weekend, much to the consternation of his bosses. Typically any light pressure from his bosses would corral him back into his cubicle, but Norman was so very tired, and uncharacteristically stuck to his guns. And so, he took a weekend where he ordered in takeout, watched reruns of his favourite show, and spent quality time with his cat.\n\nWhen he awoke the following Monday the tremor was still there. He'd tried to put it out of his mind over the weekend but one of the times he'd fed his cat his hand shook so badly he'd slopped the wet food onto the floor. His cat looked at the food splatted on the floor and turned its gaze up at Norman in disgust. When on his hands and knees cleaning up the mess the tremor had caused Norman to smear it across the tiles before he used his non-dominant hand to clean it up properly.\n\nNorman did his best to conceal the tremor from his colleagues, often resorting to pressing his hand tightly against his chest, as though swearing an oath. Luckily for Norman, he mostly went unnoticed at work so he needn't have worried.\n\nThe recommendation from his doctor to see a specialist had come as unwelcome news. It wasn't that Norman didn't want to figure out what was causing the shaking but rather that the health insurance provided by his job was unlikely to cover the costs that specialist consultation would incur.\n\nNorman had made the decision to wait it out. It was probably nothing. Besides, he was lucky to have the health insurance he did. He did wonder for a moment, though, what it must be like to live in a country where he wouldn't have to worry about paying for treatments. He shook his head with a sad smile and dismissed it as fantasy. There were plenty of people worse off than he was, without any cover at all. Norman was lucky, really lucky, to have this job and insurance.\n\nNorman pressed his shaking hand into the table and scrunched up his referral letter from his doctor with his good hand and binned it.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1582086474.0,"comments":[{"author":null,"text":"This is the best Norman story I have read so far this year!","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1582096511.0}]},{"title":"Norman is running late","author":"twoshortdogs2019","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/f5nsxd\/norman_is_running_late\/","text":"Norman liked to arrive at work five minutes early, so that he had time to make a cup of tea and fill his water bottle in the lunchroom before heading to his desk and switching on his computer. \n\nToday, however, Norman\u2019s bus had arrived late.

The spreadsheet that he had been working on that afternoon didn\u2019t balance and Norman had been unable to find the error before 5:00pm. \n\nWhile Norman had considered staying a little later to balance the spreadsheet he didn\u2019t want to risk missing the beginning of tonight\u2019s CSI episode. It was a re-run, which Norman had seen previously, but those first few minutes were often crucial to the story. It would ruin the experience to start watching part way through. \n\nNorman had chosen to drive to work today, instead of taking the bus. It had been raining quite heavily that morning and he was grateful that the skies had since cleared up. He decided to stop on the way home and pick up some plain crisps to enjoy while he was watching his show. \n\nStill contemplating his spreadsheet error, Norman turned right into the car park of his local grocery store. As he did, the driver of the car behind him leaned on the horn. Startled, Norman glanced in his rear view mirror just in time to see the driver gesturing (quite rudely) in the direction of Norman\u2019s Nissan. Norman\u2019s heart was racing from the encounter and he wondered why the other driver would do such a thing. \n\nPulling carefully into a free parking space well away from the entrance Norman turned off the ignition and took a deep breath. Opening the car door he looked back towards the road where a blue car\u2019s turn signal was indicating its intention to turn into the car park. Suddenly, Norman realised that his pre-occupation had caused him to forget to use his turn signal which understandably explained the reaction of the driver behind him. \n\nNorman was embarrassed at his momentary lack of concentration and felt that the rude gesture was somewhat deserved. Face a little flushed, Norman locked the car and headed towards the store entrance. \n\nAfter selecting and paying for his crisps (and a small treat for Norman) Norman took extra care driving home, making sure to use his turn signal well in advance each time.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1581731543.0,"comments":[{"author":null,"text":"Poor Norman","upvotes":2,"created_utc":1581736026.0}]},{"title":"Norman reads at lunch","author":"twoshortdogs2019","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/f3pk44\/norman_reads_at_lunch\/","text":"Norman was sitting in the lunchroom reading a chapter from the latest crime scene novel by one of his favourite authors.

He couldn't reach past the strings to retrieve it, so he held the guitar upside-down and began to shake it, hoping the pick would fall out. After about a minute of finagling with the guitar, the pick fell out.\n\nAll that shaking exhausted Norman. *That's enough guitar for today,* he thought. He placed the guitar in the corner of the living room instead of the closet so he would be more easily inspired to play it again. He then returned to the television.

He recalled a day from several weeks earlier where he had to throw out a pair of holey socks and thought that it would make for a good Morton story. And so Norman wrote. He proofread the story several times and corrected any typos and grammatical errors that he noticed, but when it came time to submit the story to the forum for the world to see, Norman hesitated.\n\n'Not today', thought Norman. He highlighted the text and hit the delete button on his keyboard.\n\nNorman commended his restraint in letting Morton go. He knew that he only had it in him to lead one life - the life of Norman.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1580403695.0,"comments":[{"author":"Doomy22","text":"I bet Morton's favorite show is NCIS","upvotes":20,"created_utc":1580409094.0},{"author":"NewtFlute","text":"Does Morton have a cat named Morton?","upvotes":5,"created_utc":1580425543.0},{"author":"Dotcor_Strangelove","text":"Norman, much like Morton, is a simple man who knows what he's about.","upvotes":6,"created_utc":1580430114.0},{"author":"wearingaredjacket","text":"This made me smile slightly.

Ethan was the youngest person in Norman's department and was by far the most outgoing of the bunch, often trying to organize social events outside of work, with limited success. Since his birthday fell on a Friday that year he decided to invite everybody to a birthday lunch at a local pub. Norman usually did not attend Ethan's events, but since the entire team was going he decided he would join them.\n\nNorman would enjoy a refreshing beer from time to time, but the heavier drinking days of his younger years were behind him. He had a few preferred brands of beer, but he certainly couldn't keep up with all the microbrews that had popped up in recent years. When the waitress asked them what they would like to drink, Norman had no idea. The drink menu was made up entirely of unfamiliar microbrew beer, so Norman asked Ethan if he had any recommendations. Ethan suggested one called Skippity Bop Double IPA and Norman took him up on his suggestion. \n\nAfter his first sip Norman did not regret the decision - it was absolutely delicious! He detected a hint of citrus, and despite its bitter, hoppy taste it went down very easy. The waitress took awhile to return to their table due to the busy lunch rush, and by the time she came back Norman's glass was empty. He ordered another Skippity Bop Double IPA when he ordered his food.\n\nThe 2nd round of drinks actually arrived fairly quickly, but the food took much longer. By the time the food arrived, Norman had finished drink #2. He thought he better not order a 3rd beer as there was still an afternoon of work ahead, but Ethan urged him to order another. \"Do it for my birthday, Norm buddy, I insist!\", Ethan said. Norman hesitated, but ultimately gave in and agreed to order a 3rd Skippity Bop Double IPA.\n\nThe meal ended and when Norman received his bill he noticed that it read '3x Skippity Bop Double IPA (9%)'. \n\nNINE PERCENT! \n\nSuddenly Norman realized that he was quite tipsy. He was able to downplay it well enough around his co-workers, but he was very unproductive for the rest of the afternoon. When 5 o'clock rolled around he decided he had better call a taxi to take him home. Norman vowed that in the future he would pay closer attention to the alcohol content of unfamiliar beverages.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1580318305.0,"comments":[{"author":"petertree","text":"Ah so he kept on par with his heavier drinking days!

The employee that he flagged down told him that they must be out back in the warehouse. He then said that Norman could just take the product # to the cash to purchase the mower and then pick it up at the loading bay. The cashier seemed confused when Norman explained this to her, so after Norman paid for the mower she directed him to the customer service desk for further assistance. She also handed Norman a $50 gift card as part of a special promotion for anyone who spent more than $100 that day.\n\nThe customer service clerk told Norman that this model of mower was out of stock, and that it had also been discontinued. The only option at her disposal was to give Norman a refund. Norman sighed, but he had no choice but to accept this outcome. 'It is what it is', he thought to himself. Then Norman remembered the gift card in his pocket. He wondered if he should mention that he had it, or whether he should just stay quiet and at least get $50 out of this ordeal. Norman was opposed to stealing, but, the card *was* given to him, so shouldn't it be his? Before Norman could muster up the courage to leave the gift card unmentioned, the clerk asked him if he had it and told him that he would have to give it back. \n\nNorman immediately returned the gift card to the clerk.

He\u2019d been in the gym a grand total of ten minutes. He cracked his neck from one side to another and lamented that Tiffani would certainly judge him when she saw him leave so quickly. Would she call security to see if there had been some kind of issue? An extra long shower might buy him some time and make it look less obvious. He undressed slowly before taking a clean towel out of his gym bag and wrapping himself in it. Then he got up and made his way over to the shower area, refusing to look in the row of mirrors above the sinks.\n\nAs he passed the fogged up door into the sauna room, it opened up. A cloud of steam spilled out in front of Norman and a man who looked to be in his sixties walked out wearing a towel around his waist. He was slick with sweat and his skin was a dull pink. Norman paused as the man went straight to the sink, splashed cold water on his brow, and turned around with a smile. \u201cHelluva schvitz in there today, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t tried it,\u201d Norman said. \u201cI just finished working out.\u201d He gestured behind him to the door into the fitness room.\n\nThe man let out a laugh and walked over to where Norman was standing. \u201cWhat, in the meat market?

You come with me.\u201d He walked back to the door and opened it up.\n\nNorman hesitated, but followed him inside. The steam wasn\u2019t as thick as it had seemed, but the air was hot and humid. A bunch of men who were all around Norman\u2019s age and a little out of shape were sitting on benches around the room. One leaned back against the wall with a towel over his face, one was sitting hunched forward, and two of them looked like they had just paused a conversation. The man put a sweaty arm around Norman\u2019s shoulders. \u201cBoys, I wanna introduce you to- what\u2019d you say your name was again?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, Norman,\u201d said Norman.\n\n\u201cNorman!\u201d the man continued. \u201cNorman, I\u2019m Morty, and this is Rico, Samuel, Mikey, Paulie, and Jonathan.\u201d Morty dropped onto an empty bench near a couple of the guys and let out a loud sigh, patting the space beside him.\n\n\u201cNice to meet you all,\u201d said Norman politely, giving a little wave.

Everywhere he looked, people in their twenties and thirties wore tight fitting and expensive looking workout gear. A couple of guys in tank tops yelled at their friend as he struggled to squat with a huge set of weights in a rack by the wall.\n\nNorman grabbed a small towel from the stack by the door and went over to the nearest machine and sat down with his back against the padded rest. He looked at the diagram printed on the side, but couldn't figure out what it meant. He squinted to read the detailed description, wishing he'd brought his reading glasses.\n\n\"Yo,\" said a deep voice. \"You need any help with this thing, bro?\"\n\nNorman looked up to see a man who was easily six feet tall and incredibly muscular. \"Uh, no, thank you. I'm just finishing up. It's all yours,\" he mumbled, embarrassed. He stood up and moved to the side, using the towel to wipe some imaginary sweat from his brow. The young man shrugged, sat down with his chest against the padded rest, and proceeded to make the machine look very easy to use.\n\nNorman glanced around. In the corner, he spied a water cooler. \"At least I've got some experience using that bad boy,\" he thought to himself with a chuckle as he walked over to it. A woman came up to the cooler as well. *GO BIG OR GO HOME*, said the neon text printed across the front of her black sports bra. Norman thought it was the perfect motto for his new lifestyle.\n\nHe drifted into a daydream about Strong Norman at the office. He'd pause for a minute by Randall's desk. Randall would look up and say something like, \"Lookin' good, Norm!\" and Strong Norman would pretend that it hadn't been that hard to make the changes.\n\n\"Diet and exercise, Randy,\" he'd say. \"Go big or go home, bro!\"\n\nStrong Norman was just about to help the water delivery guy by carrying two jugs to the staff lounge at the same time, when a voice brought him back to reality.\n\n\"Hey old man,\" the woman in the sports bra said sharply, pointing at her face, \"I'm up here!\"\n\nNorman realized where he'd been staring and immediately felt his face turn crimson. \"I- I'm so sorry!\" he stammered, \"I wasn't- I would never-\"\n\n\"Whatever, creep,\" she said.

While he didn't have much hair on top of his mostly bald head, the hair on the sides and back still required regular maintenance. For more then half of his life he had been getting his hair trimmed at a local barbershop just up the road from his house. Norman knew that his regular barber was out of town on vacation and that he would have to find another place to get his haircut. He did not want to go to a big chain barbershop, and had been told by a co-worker about another small-time barbershop on the other side of the city. As Norman got into his car he thought to himself that it was about time he had a big adventure.\n\nNorman was not overly familiar with that side of town - the west side. It was a rougher, poorer area, and while Norman did not frequent the west side very often, he had no trouble with anyone from there. \"Never judge a book by its cover\", he could hear his mother's wise words ringing in his head. \n\nIt took Norman 15 minutes to drive there, and once he was there he quickly realized that he was lost. He decided that he would just ask the next person he saw for directions. As he drove past a large church he saw a woman standing on the sidewalk and pulled his car up next to her. She certainly did not appear to be dressed for church, but Norman remembered that he should never judge someone by their appearance and that this lady was likely just enjoying the nice, warm day. Norman rolled down his passenger window, leaned over the passenger seat, and said, \"Excuse me, ma'am?\".\n\nShe approached the car, bent over, peered into the window at Norman and said, \"What can I do for you today baby?\", to which Norman replied, \"I'm afraid I'm a bit lost. I'm looking for Newton Avenue, do you know if that's near here?\"\n\nThe woman sensually responded, \"20 bucks and I'll hop in to show you the way, daddy-o, I'll make it worth your while. Another 100 and we can really party.\"\n\nNorman assumed that she was offering to pay him for a ride. He just responded \"Oh no thanks, I don't want any money, but I'd be happy to give you a lift if you're heading that way. I'm really just looking for Mutt's Cuts\". He added jokingly, while patting his head, \"it's time this mop got a trim!\".\n\nThe woman rolled her eyes, backed away from the car and shouted, \"Just up the road, 4 blocks. Take a right at the 7\/11. Can't miss it.\", while pointing in the direction Norman was headed. Norman thanked her and drove off. He then found Mutt's Cuts, got a mostly satisfactory haircut that he would tweak at home with his trimmer (as he did not want to bother the barber with adjustments), and drove back home.\n\nOn his way back home he saw the same woman leaning into another gentleman's car at the same spot where he had asked her for directions. He admired her kindness to strangers and was hopeful that she would help this man as much as she had helped him. Norman silently thanked his mother for teaching him the skills to peer past the west side's rough outer shell and into its thoughtful, generous heart.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1580233425.0,"comments":[{"author":"Dotcor_Strangelove","text":"He could really save some money and time if he just did the whole shebang at home with his trimmer!","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1580260452.0},{"author":null,"text":"This is so cute and so...Norman.

Coupled with the promise of a free personal training session, he signed up for the package deal. \"May I use the facilities now?\" asked Norman.\n\n\"Of course you can, cutie!\" bounced Tiffani. Norman blushed at being called cutie, but tried not to let it show. \"Locker rooms and sauna are through the door on your left, weights and cardio in the main room, fitness studio in the glass area to the side, and class schedules are posted every Monday on the bulletin board in the lobby.

Now red in the face and somewhat flustered, Norman made his way into the meeting.\n\nEveryone took places around the table, Norman sat in his usual seat and reached for a glass of water...\u201chic\u201d ..\u201dOh no..no..please\u201d begged Norman, \u201cnot now.\u201d His boss started the meeting and began calling on members of the team for their reports. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, It\u2019ll be gone before he gets to me\u201d vowed Norman, and he held his breath. He held it for a long time. He must have been going red in the face again because his co-worker Dale was looking at him with mild concern. Norman stopped holding his breath.\n\n\u201dHic\u201d \n\nLisa was speaking now and Norman was beginning to panic, which wasn\u2019t good as he knew that stress would make things worse..\u201dhic.\u201d Dale\u2019s look of concern turned to one of comprehension as he grasped Norman\u2019s dilemma. He refilled Norman\u2019s water glass and nodded at him to drink it, Norman grabbed the glass and started to drink, Dale gave him a look of encouragement and Norman, taking the hint, drained the glass.\n\n\u201dHic\u201d\n\nNo one apart from Dale appeared to have noticed the drama unfolding in their midst, he was sitting midway around the table, next to be called on for his report. After that there would be one more person, and then Norman, who would have to hiccup his entire way through his figures. He knew it wasn\u2019t the worst thing that could ever happen but he assumed people would laugh and having people laugh openly at him, especially in a group, recalled memories Norman didn\u2019t like to revisit. It wasn\u2019t the same now of course, he knew that too, but It was hard to stop feelings. \n\nNorman sighed, and hiccuped, \u201cOh well, I\u2019ll get through it,\u201d he thought. \u201cYour turn Dale\u201d said the boss \u201cActually Sir do you think we could have a 15 minute break please?\u201d Asked Dale. The Boss looked at his watch and then addressed the room at large \u201cUm..Yes, ok, look since we are halfway through and I do have a phone call I need to make, let\u2019s call it 20 minutes. Go grab a coffee guys\u201d and he left the room. \n\nEveryone stood and filed out, making their way towards the coffee machine. As Norman and Dale, the last two to leave, followed them, Dale gave Norman a comradely pat on the back. Norman, thanking him, noticed that his hiccups had gone.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1580002887.0,"comments":[{"author":"SaryuSaryu","text":"That Dale is a work of class.","upvotes":26,"created_utc":1580005474.0},{"author":"mooms","text":"I like Dale.

So today,Norman decided to buy a new coffee up.\n\nThere were so many at the store; black ones,big ones,small ones,ones with quotes on them,christmas themed ones, he didn't know wich one to choose! After what felt like hours of looking through rows and rows of cups, his eyes settled on a black mug with golden streaks.The price was reasonable, black and gold were classy colors yes, it was befitting of the new man he would soon become ! \n\nWhen he got home,Norman put the mug down on the kitchen table, and started making coffee.Once he poured the coffee in it, he pondered wether to pour milk in it too. Nonsense.Great Men drink theirs black.Maybe with alittle bit of sugar. Norman didn't like the taste, he never liked coffee to begin with, but thought that would change soon. Now, he had to go to the gym.Afterwards, he'd go to his date. Norman drowned the coffee,washed the mug and put it in the cupboard.\n\nIt was still in the cupborad when he came back from the gym,looking at himself in the mirror comparing his body to that the well built men in the weightlifting section. It was still in the cupborad when he came back home at 9:15 pm after realising that his date stood him up without so much as a text.It was still in the cupborad when he was smoking his 10th cigarettre of the night.\n\nNo Great Men were made out of small deeds \n\nNorman tried to go to the gym again,and the mug was still in cupborad when he came back an hour later than the day before.It was still in the cupboard when he was reserching alternative to nicotine, before gave up.\n\nIt was still in the cupboard when he came back from work, flustered thinking of Sarah, a new co-worker at his office.It was still in the cupboard when he came back from the gym a little early after Thomas helped him with his weightlifting tehnique.\n\nIt was still in the cupboard when he came home with just one pack of cigarettes instead of two, and only smoked 6 because he was caught up texting. It was still in the cupboard when he came back from the gym the day after with sore muscles and no joints hurting his time.\n\nIt was still in the cupboard 8 months later, when he came home with Sarah one night.It was still in the cupboard  when he came back from the gym without realising he didn't even feel out of place this time.\n\nIt was still in the cupborad when Sarah moved in a year later -forgotten and dusty-but there.And it was still there when Thomas complimented Norman for his arms.They saw each other there occasionally .Each time Thomas remarked on Norman's growing confidence Norman, while flattered, failed to see anything significantly different.He just felt alright somedays.\n\nIt was still in the cupboard when Norman came home and realised he forgot to buy cigarettes and decided he was too lazy to get out again.\n\nIt was no longer in the cupboard when Norman made hot chocolate for himself and Sarah.After all , what was christmas without a hot drink? It was their third one together and Norman's son called earlier to invite him to his graduation ceremony, they discussed spending next holidays together with his son's girlfriend somewhere nice.\n\nNorman still disliked coffee.

This would be 3 of 5 on his punch card and met the internal rule he created that he could throw it out once the majority was used up. Sandra gave it at the work \"Bad Christmas Gift Exchange\" and meant for it to show how worldly she was or how \"out there\" she was or maybe to impress Steve. Norman got stuck with it because of a new rule in the game. Norman didn't care as he had already held the cat magnet (his top pick) and he realized he only wanted them when someone else held them. He'd never want them more if someone else had them. Norman's gift was a cat mug and it was very popular. Norman was pleased.\u00a0\n\nHe had meditated quite a few times before, but still Norman couldn't quite tell the difference between a nap and meditation. There was the first time when he fell asleep, the time he made a grocery list, the time he tried to before the pizza arrived and probably 4 other naps. Plus there were the two yoga\/meditation combo classes he previously used his punch card for. They were\u2026, well, you can read about them elsewhere. Norman normally wouldn't go, but he thought he had been missing 5 minutes of sleep each day for the last week and this would solve the accounting.\u00a0\n\nThere was a large group of people gathered. You could tell that no one knew each other. The nervous extroverts talked quickly about nothing and the nervous introverts talked not at all. A chatty lady started to talk to him, but Norman quickly went back to check his coat. This was the second time he went back to his coat. It was a new trick he was trying. He would hang it up, change rooms and then go back to get his gum or a pen. This was the pen run, which was silly as he didn't have any paper.\u00a0\n\nThe instructor brought everyone together and explained what was about to happen. They would introduce themselves, explain why they were here, meditate and then have tea and chat. Norman thought the best part would be the tea. The instructor chanted his name. Norman started to calculate when to go for his pen so he would miss his turn, but was immediately frustrated that he had used that trick already. Everyone repeated the instructor's name back. They then went around the room with everyone saying their own name and everyone repeating it back them.\u00a0\n\n\"Norman\", Norman said. He was half relieved that he pronounced it right, but half confused that that was actually his name. It didn't quite sound right for him or to him.\u00a0\n\n\"Norman\", the group said and confirmed that that was his name and that it was more than enough for him.\u00a0\n\nThere was another Norman in the class but Norman was pretty sure that wasn't his name. He didn't look like a Norman at all. And he gave a shy look to Norman when he said it.\u00a0\n\nThen they all explained what brought them there that night. Some were brief and others rambled a lot. Some were funny and others were sad, some were joyful and others solemn. Some came a short distance and others took them their whole life to get there. The lady who tried to talk to him earlier had an expressive way of talking and got the whole group to laugh, even Norman. Norman explained about the punch card and the christmas game they played at the office. He worried he was coming off solemn, so he mentioned his cat. It got a couple laughs.\u00a0\n\nThen they all sat and meditated. The instructor spoke most of the time, but Norman stopped paying attention almost immediately.\u00a0\n\nNorman closed his eyes\n<  <\n\n\n>  >\nNorman opened his eyes.\u00a0\n\nThe instructor was ringing a bell and then they got up for tea. Their tea selection was fabulous. Norman picked mint, like his gum. Norman talked to a few people. They were all very polite. Norman found that he had things to say at times and just listened at other times. During a lull in conversation he went for his pen trick again, but the chatty women asked him if he was leaving. He was surprised, so he said yes. He needed to feed his cat. A couple more laughs.\u00a0\n\nAs he walked home Norman thought that maybe Sandra didn't give that card to seem worldly or out-there, or even for Steven. That's just what Norman thought.

He went to the kitchen and stared into the pantry. Grape Nuts or Raisin Bran? He settled down to a bowl of heart healthy tiny Grape-Nuts with 2% milk. \n\nOnce he finished he looked outside and saw the street was relatively quiet.

The mornings were filled with various workshops and presentations, while the afternoons were meant for fun group activities. While Norman enjoyed the time away from the dullness of his regular daily work tasks, he always felt a little bit awkward during the organized social activities. Group games were never his favorite thing, but, they also weren't so bad that Norman would overly dread them. They were just something that he would have to grin and bear. What Norman always looked forward to with great anticipation, though, was the time spent at the beach. \n\nThe whole team would head to the beach in the late afternoon every day that the weather cooperated. Beach time did not include any organized group activities, and was just casual time to allow everyone a chance to relax and unwind. Norman always brought a book with him and would alternate between reading, napping (under an umbrella, of course!), and swimming in the ocean. Norman was dismayed that the rain cancelled day one's beach day, but what dismayed him even more was the realization that he had forgotten to pack his swim trunks.\n\nNorman knew that he would have to venture into town to buy a new pair of swim trunks. He was not overly familiar with the town, but he did know that they had a particular chain store that sold beach items in the summer and may well also sell swim trunks. He drove across town on its one main road in very heavy traffic (this was tourist season after all!) and finally arrived at the chain store. Half an hour to drive three miles! Oh how Norman cursed his forgetfulness, nearly uttering to himself four-letter words that only rarely escaped his mouth.\n\nNorman searched the store but did not find any swim trunks. As he dejectedly departed the store, he noticed a thrift store across the street and thought that he might be able to find some swim trunks there. When Norman entered the thrift store he quickly found a rack with men's swim trunks. Norman muttered to himself as he went through the rack, as every pair he looked at was either much, much smaller or much, much larger than would fit his mostly average middle-aged body. Finally he found a pair of trunks in his size...but, they were neon yellow. \n\nNorman was not a neon yellow kind of person - he preferred soft, Earth tones that allowed him to blend into the background. Norman checked through the swim trunk rack one more time to make sure that he didn't miss any other trunks that would fit him. He then checked the rack a third time, this time browsing in the opposite direction. Unfortunately, the neon yellow swim trunks remained his only option aside from trying to find another store in a hectic, unfamiliar town. Norman grimaced for a moment and then decided to take the swim trunks off the rack, bring them to the cash, and purchase them. Norman then took the long, short drive back to his hotel room and hung his new swim trunks over a chair. \n\nNorman spent the rest of the evening trying to distract himself by reading his book instead of thinking about wearing his neon yellow swim trunks to the beach in front of all of his co-workers. Much to Norman's chagrin, he knew that he would stick out like a sore thumb.\n\nBefore Norman went to bed he checked the weather forecast for the next day. It was going to be beautiful - hot and sunny.\n\nPerfect beach weather.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1579059055.0,"comments":[{"author":null,"text":"Style it out Norman, wear them like you were born to wear neon.","upvotes":3,"created_utc":1579060737.0}]},{"title":"Norman smokes weed","author":"bearseascape","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/eoyyg4\/norman_smokes_weed\/","text":"He just knew that the lawn grass would provide his ribeye with just the right flavor.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1579071684.0,"comments":[{"author":null,"text":"You had me worried there for a second.

The ruined pass had served him well over the week. It made more sense just to pay the extra two bucks for a ride home.\n\nBut that was the second problem. Norman hadn\u2019t expected this development, so he spent the last paper money in his wallet on a bottle of 7-Up from the vending machine at the office. His debit card was at home.

Whatever glass Norman took out of the cupboard each morning became his glass for the day, and he just filled it back up whenever it emptied to ensure that he always had a nice, cold glass of water at his immediate disposal.\n\nWhile the ice cold water was refreshing, sometimes Norman just didn't enjoy the feeling of his mouth being cold, even if the cold sensation was a brief one. It was on this glorious day that Norman took a 2nd glass out of his cupboard, filled it with cold, filtered water from the fridge, then put it at the back of his kitchen counter to rest. His other glass still contained cold water, which he would sip on - as usual, throughout the day. He may have had to wait to drink the room temperature water, but it was important that he did not let waiting for it reduce his now normal water consumption rate.\n\nNorman then went about his day, taking care of the things that needed taking care of, occasionally sipping from his ice cold glass of water and refilling it when it emptied. Several hours later Norman realized that he had lost track of time and ended up having a late lunch. \n\nWhile preparing his sandwich (whole wheat bread, 3 slices of Cajun chicken breast, 1 slice of provolone cheese, mustard, and a light spread of mayo), Norman noticed the cup of water resting on the counter. Norman had forgotten all about it! His eyes lit up as the room temperature water realization dawn on him. Norman finished making his sandwich, grabbed the glass of room temperature water, then sat at the dining room table to have his lunch.\n\nHe quickly devoured the sandwich, and then, with great anticipation, lifted the glass of room temperature water to his lips. He took a large sip, much larger than he would ever take from a glass of cold water, then held it in his mouth to let his mouth revel in the lack of coldness before swallowing it. It was deeply satisfying, enough that Norman even allowed himself to smile. He took another big sip, then another. Before he knew it, the glass was empty.\n\nNorman knew right then and there that he would need to buy another filtered water jug to fill each morning and keep on the counter. \n\nNorman also knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that today was truly the first day of the rest of his life.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1578538973.0,"comments":[{"author":"RheingoldRiver","text":"Ok this kinda happened to me......for YEARS I was having refrigerated water and I always was kinda sad when it was fresh from the fridge.....one day I realized wtf am I doing and now I don't refrigerate my water and it's SO MUCH BETTER\n\noh my god im norman","upvotes":33,"created_utc":1578544292.0},{"author":"KingCraigslist","text":"The best one.","upvotes":12,"created_utc":1578539920.0},{"author":"Stalker_Bleach","text":"you turned Norman into a psychopath","upvotes":7,"created_utc":1578541458.0},{"author":"lumbridge12","text":"i work in an office i just finihed reading this and im gonna go dirk some wter at the fountain its a filtered fountain and its not too cold","upvotes":1,"created_utc":1578610774.0}]},{"title":"Norman Purchases an On-Sale Steak","author":"Doomy22","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/emdtfh\/norman_purchases_an_onsale_steak\/","text":"Norman's right arm was getting heavy from carrying the grocery basket (\"*Why don't I ever choose a cart?*\" Norman thought), and he still didn't have a plan for supper that evening.\n\nGlancing at the meat section, Norman noticed a New York Strip Steak on sale.

Day to day Norman never needed spell checker but today he looked at the word and just could not see the problem, even spell check gave no suggestions for a correction. Norman refused to send a memo with a possible typo and decided to see if his phone could suggest the proper spelling.

The auto suggest gave him a correction in a second and he fixed the mistake before saving the Memo and sending it out. Then Norman's phone dinged at him.

He also noticed another even larger hole on the top of his right sock, and let out an audible sigh. Norman knew this would be the last time he ever wore these socks.

Norman knew next to nothing about motorcycles; he could only tell that Ken's had lots of chrome, glossy black paint, and once he looked closer, gold pin-striping. \"Sure is a beauty,\" Norman said.\n\n\"Yeah. It needs a bath,\" Ken said. \"I'd like to get a newer one, but we've been saving up to remodel the kitchen.\"\n\n\"Yes, there's always something,\" Norman said. \"Well, have fun.\" He smiled at Ken before heading off down the sidewalk.\n\nAbout halfway through the six-block walk back home, Norman heard the rumble of a motorcycle behind him.  He turned around to see Ken on his black bike. As the motorcycle passed him, Norman and Ken waved to each other simultaneously. A few blocks further on, the road curved to the right and the bike rolled out of sight.\n\nLots of thoughts drifted through Norman's mind as he continued walking home. He decided that he really had no desire to ride a motorcycle. But he made it a point to plan a trip to the seashore again sometime.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1578075740.0,"comments":[{"author":null,"text":"I enjoy it when Norman has a wholesome and positive interaction, especially when it gives him plans for the future.","upvotes":4,"created_utc":1578079554.0}]},{"title":"Norman tried meditation.","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/lifeofnorman\/comments\/ej1xeq\/norman_tried_meditation\/","text":"Norman pulled a cushion onto the floor and lowered himself onto it. He\u2019d seen a magazine article about meditation recently and had been thinking of trying it himself. He wasn\u2019t particularly stressed, but all the same, he thought it sounded interesting and he liked the idea of learning a new skill, especially one he could do at home.\n\nThis was actually his second attempt, he\u2019d first tried it in his recliner after work a few days ago but had simply fallen asleep, which was inconvenient as he\u2019d not woken up until 3am and it had really put his routine out. Hence the cushion on the floor.  \n\nThe magazine had a picture of an athletic, fresh faced man and woman sitting eyes closed and straight backed on the floor in what he believed was called the lotus position. Norman was neither as fresh of face nor as flexible as the young couple featured so he simply sat on his cushion with his back against the couch, legs and slippered feet straight out in front of him, \u201cthat\u2019ll do\u201d he thought.\n\nHe closed his own eyes and tried to focus only on his breathing as the article had instructed, *\u201din....and\u2026.out\u201d* he intoned silently, faithfully pairing the words with their actions. It wasn\u2019t long however, before what Norman called his \u201cbusy mind thoughts\u201d began intruding on the peace  *\u201dwhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d* Queried his internal voice and, before he could shut it down with further slow conscious breathing and helpful mantra chanting, he found himself planning a menu. This was summarily followed by the internal recording of a shopping list of things he would need to purchase to achieve said meal, a map of the route he\u2019d take around the supermarket to buy them and a timeline around when to both cook and serve it. \n\nNorman opened his eyes and sighed deeply, shook his head and gave a little chuckle \u201cOh well, it wasn\u2019t a complete waste of time Norman\u201d he said to his completely disinterested companion \u201cat least I\u2019ve got a meal plan and shopping list out of it\u201d and, with a sense of achievement Norman heaved himself off the floor and went to put on his coat.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1577989351.0,"comments":[{"author":"BigDiggy","text":"Classic Norman letting his mind wonder.","upvotes":24,"created_utc":1577991517.0},{"author":null,"text":"I tried to have Norman meditate in the only story I wrote about him too!

For the slightest moment his heart jumped at the time, he should have been at work long ago. Alas, today was the start of a new year and a holiday from work. He breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nThen his heart jumped again and this time didn\u2019t slow as he remembered the events of the previous night. As the final seconds of 2019 counted down Norman had found himself counting along with the rest of his office mates and their spouses with a glass of champagne poised at the ready to cheer in the New Year. \n\nWhen Norma asked him earlier in the week if he\u2019d be attending the office party he was about to tell her that he would not be able to make it. Before he could he get the words out she had added, \u201cIt would be really great to see you there,\u201d and then quickly shifted her gaze to her feet.\n\nDeciding in that moment to push the boundaries of convention and start his New Year\u2019s Resolution to \u2018be more social\u2019 a day early he said, \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d And found he was admiring his own shoes as he added, \u201cI look forward to see you.\u201d\n\nNormally a wallflower Norman had spent much of the evening talking with Norma and found her to be delightful and easy to converse with. She also had a cat and enjoyed his favorite show CSI. The servers at the party had refilled his champagne several times and he was feeling light and airy as Norma showed silly pictures of her cat on her phone. The midnight countdown caught him quite unexpectedly, he had not planned on staying out so late!\n\nThen, as the countdown lowered to TWO!! Norma\u2019s hand laid on his forearm and he looked down into her eyes. He barely mouthed the word ONE!! along with the rest of the crowd, something about her eyes had stolen the air from his lungs. Cries of \u201cHappy New Year!!\u201d and the sounds of noise makers barely pierced his ears as at that same moment he found Norma\u2019s lips pressed to his for one brilliant moment. \n\nThe party slowed and Norman bid his goodbyes, including a hug from Norma before taking a taxi back to his flat. In the morning light as he lay in bed he wondered if the whole thing had been a wonderful dream. One more memory surfaced in his mind and the calendar on his phone confirmed it. \u201cCSI with Norma, Norman\u2019s flat,\u201d Thursday night. 2020 was starting off to be a very interesting year.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1577900632.0,"comments":[{"author":"crippledwithjoy","text":"is- is this allowed?","upvotes":63,"created_utc":1577907563.0},{"author":null,"text":"Gosh Norman!","upvotes":19,"created_utc":1577917028.0},{"author":"Anything_189","text":" That\u2019s my boy!

He\u2019d been to after work drinks with Lisa and a few other colleagues from his office. He\u2019d never done this before so it was something of a new adventure for him and he hadn\u2019t really known what to expect. \n\nThey\u2019d gone to a nearby hotel bar, which was very nice. Norman had been a little apprehensive about the venue beforehand, he didn\u2019t know how comfortable he would feel in a noisy sports bar and he couldn\u2019t really imagine himself perched on a high stool in a sleek glass and chrome cocktail bar either, but he needn\u2019t have worried, the hotel bar had been small with subtle background music and comfortable chairs. He\u2019d been relieved. \n\nHis colleagues were friendly and although Norman hadn\u2019t said a lot he felt, on reflection, that he\u2019d held his own conversation wise and even made a few jokes! Yes, he was glad he\u2019d gone, and he\u2019d had a nice time, but he was happy to be home now, with Norman curled up on his lap, his favourite episode of CSI on TV and a cup of hot chocolate in his hand. But he definitely wouldn\u2019t rule out maybe doing it again some time.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1577753925.0,"comments":[{"author":"maybestomorrow","text":"This is perfect!
