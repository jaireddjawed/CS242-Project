The slow drip can add another minute or so to the total brew time if you count that. \n\nObviously this is kind of splitting hairs and TBT is (in my opinion) kind of useless beyond diagnosing bad brews, l, but Ive always wondered how people out there time their brews.",

Green coffee stays fresh much longer and allows you to roast how much you need for the week. \n\nCoffee is still good after a week but there is something special about those first few days to one week. The bloom is so intense you can hear the filter paper displacing slightly. Sticking your nose in a bag too… there is a clear difference. \n\nMaybe it’s in my head but it be end coffee seems much more flavorful too. \n\nAm I delusional or are there other believers?

I'm staying away from trade even though it has the biggest selection because so many people on here say they're awful.

The tartness has decreased through the trials, as I went from coarser to finer grind size.\nShould I go even finer?\n\nI’ve been following coffee-saint Hoffman’s v60 advice: make a burrow in the center of the grounds, bloom for up to 45 seconds, swirl (though I’ve only swirled in one direction, so maybe that’s an issue, since he recommends swirling in two directions to inhibit any sort of vortex forming). When the coffee settles, it makes a flat bed and there are minimal grounds left on the sides of the filter.\n\nSo in short: what other factors than grind size, particularly in a flat-bottom pourover like the Kalita Wave, might contribute to this tartness?",

Pucks still have some water in them, but far less than when it was set around 6-8.  Instructions say not to change the grind size, but what say others that have the machine?\n\nCoffee - If I do max coffee and max amount, coffee is still a bit weak/sour.  Do most folks that want a full cup do max coffee and the middle amount and just brew two cups?\n\nLatte - Biggest disappointment.  I don't know why I thought it would make a proper latte, but it's limited to 8oz and almost 1/3 of that is milk foam.  We're used to the local cafes that serve a 12oz latte so it's a bit sad in the cup.  Taste is fine.\n\nI bought this for afternoon coffee where a quick cup is appreciated.  During my morning routine, when I have more time, I use a Comandante hand grinder and clever dripper. \n\nThanks in advance for any input / feedback!",

There are a couple of supplements and foods you can take to reduce the affect of caffeine.\n\nFirst of lets look at **Caffeine's Method of Action**.\n\nCaffeine is an indirect GABA-A antagonist via antagonism of Adenosine Receptors \\[[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.05196.x)\\]. Adenosine Receptors are responsible for making you tired, so antagonism results in stimulation. 80 percent of caffeine destruction is mediated by CYP1A2 \\[[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223808/)\\].\n\n**Caffeine Killers**\n\n* Lemon Balm\n\nLemon Balm inhibits [GABA-T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-aminobutyrate_transaminase) \\[[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19165747/)\\], the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of GABA. It also agonizes Adenosine receptors \\[[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221012695)\\] making it one of the best caffeine counterparts.\n\n* L-theanine\n\nL-theanine binds to several glutamate receptors as an antagonist \\[[5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17182482/)\\]. It lowers excitatory transmission, and it is commonly used to rid caffeine of it's jitters.\n\n* CBD\n\nCBD and THC are both inhibitors of ENT-1 \\[[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8434367/)\\], a vital enzyme in the destruction of adenosine. Taking CBD will cause Adenosine levels to build up.\n\n* Hops\n\nHops has flavonoids and alpha acids that are great for cognitive function and health \\[[7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32474473/)\\]. It also modulates Adenosine Receptors which will result in less caffeine stimulation \\[[8](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34156813/)\\].\n\n* Cruciferous Vegetables\n\nVeggies like cauliflower, broccoli and cabbages all induce the CYP1A2 enzyme \\[[9](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10837004/)\\]. This enzyme as I mentioned causes breakdown of caffeine. Eating Cruciferous vegetables will speed up the destruction of caffeine in your body.  The opposite can occur as well, I have taken a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor before drinking coffee in the morning, and I was still jittery by night time.\n\n**Honorable Mentions**\n\nBlack Seed Oil, Passionflower, Valerian root, Lavender, California Poppy, Lactuca Virosa, skullcap, damiana, chamomile etc...",

I've a few questions related to brewing, grind size, temp, how to taste coffee, draw down time, etc.\n\nSo,\n\nWithout having any coffee tasting knowledge, I've managed to get some cups with quite a lot of body and some with a little acidity. I tend to favor the acid cups. I however haven't rly dialed in my grind size. Got the Wilfa Svart Nymalt/Aroma and been playing around the \"Aeropress\" range on the hopper dial. Workshopcoffee recommends setting the red line at the first \"r\" in Aeropress. Anyone has any settings for this? Especially for 2 cup brews.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, any tips on tasting and dialing in the grind size? Like what to look for/taste for? When do you typically stop counting the draw down time? When the top of the bed is no longer saturated or when the brew almost stops dripping? Reduce water temp in darker brews? Is it correctly understood that higher water temp and small grind size both equal higher extraction ? (would only make sense to me)",

        "text": "So I've just recently started keeping a daily tasting journal of my brewing recipes. I use an Aeropress with James Hoffman's method. \n\nCurrently brewing a fairly light roast natural process Mexican coffee from a local roaster.\n\nAfter settling on 12g/200g water at 98C, I decided to scale up to 15/250 the next day. Interestingly, the cup had a very similar flavor profile, but was less acid forward. I'm thinking it might be due to the water that gets through the filter before I get the plunger on. With the larger brew, that under-steeped coffee is a smaller percentage of the final product.\n\nI was very surprised initially that just scaling up with the same ratio changed the taste. \n\nI haven't tried the inverted method yet with these beans, but that's probably my next experiment. In the past, I've found that the inverted method produces a more reliable but less defined cup.\n\nI have a couple questions for everybody: \n- Does this make sense? Is the first portion of a brew the most acidic? \n- If you use the inverted method, any tips for getting more clarity from your cup?\n- I'll be getting a V60 soon. Do you experience the same effect with recipe scaling on pourovers?",

I ask him where I can try their coffee in a shop and he tells about a couple of places. As I am leaving he ask if I want some coffee, I assume he means a cup and I obliged. This is what my mans gives me. I love James Hoffmann and all of his people ( this man's name was Jay). London is so great and I just wanted to tell all my fellow coffee nerds about this amazing experience ❤️.",

I've read about light damaging roasted coffee beans and one should therefore store them in a dark place.  \nIs it \"safe\" to store the beans this close to a lamp? I've only heard direct sunlight as problematic, and the window in the picture is facing north, so is that okay? I really like these glass canisters, and I dislike the black plastic ones from Fellow...  \n\n\nBonus question: If the lamp is a problem, am I in the clear by installing light sources under the shelf?  \n\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "So I have a Comandante version 3 that I've been using for a while, however recently I have begun to wonder if there is a variance in number of clicks for a respective grind size from one Comandante to another.  \n\nThe reason I ask is, I routinely see people talking about brewing at like 19 to 25 clicks for pourover( or lower) but no matter what my other parameters are, at that setting I will get a very unpleasant bitterness, and/or clogging and channelling.  I find I have to grind around 28 to 30 clicks to get a decent cup.  Doesn't matter the coffee, water parameter, temperature, brew time etc, I will never be able to brew a V60 with my Comandante at those lower grind settings.   Even at 26 I was getting unpleasant bitter notes and astringency on every coffee in my subscription pack last month.  Click 28 to 31: nice clear, bright cups.  \n\nMy concern is twofold.  Perhaps there's a defect in my burr set that is causing a much wider particle distribution or excessive fines?  Or perhaps they aren't manufactured to very exacting tolerances, which is not very appealing.  \n\nI'm not exactly unhappy with my coffee, quite the contrary, but my OCD is plaguing my thoughts with \"it's not as good as it could be\" and I start seeing it to be very common to grind at a lower grind settings and it just fuels that fire even more so.   \n\nAnyone else grind that high on one of these?  Or any suggestions to test if the burr is not sitting right?  It looks perfectly flush at the zero point. . I just don't know.   \n\nAny thoughts?",

        "text": "So I've delved pretty deep into making the best coffee I can. I'm buying green beans, roasting them myself and doing a pour over. Sort of the basics for **quality**. I have tried many different sorts of beans from natural/dry processed to fully washed--and there are of course differences in flavor. But I have discovered that the real difference in **quality** comes from how little automation and machinery is being used on the farm. Good beans are made in **small batches**, and **sun-drying** is an absolute necessity as most farmers know. So my question to the community here is: where can I find beans that are harvested and **processed completely by hand?** With **no machinery** and certainly **no electricity** used at all. Generally whether dry or wet processing is employed, most beans eventually encounter a machine, although from what I have read, dry/natural processing techniques may use less automation overall. I understand this is going to increase the cost, but I kind of don't care--as long as it is not completely outrageous.",

After about 3 mins the coffee was done.\nI need to do more experiments, but it was a very nice cup of coffee!",
