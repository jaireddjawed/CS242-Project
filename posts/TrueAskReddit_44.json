But does this mean that finding something beautiful only means that it makes us feel good, or is the good feeling just a logical consequence of experiencing the beauty?\n\nEDIT: Maybe beauty is not the best word to describe what I mean. A piece of music, for example, can make you feel sad but still be beautiful. What i'm talking about are such things as delicious food or happy music, not 'deeper' things like art.",

Hope ya'll enjoy this question:\n\nIf being pregnant/fertile would be a RARE thing and it becomes super SCARCE, how would this effect the economy, how would it effect every country, how \n\nwould it effect the existing laws/politics, how would it affect the institution of marriage/family?  Feel free to choose your pick of the sub-topic to \n\nanswer.\n\nPlease - make up any questions and answer them however you want!\n\nObviously, the world population would totally take a nose dive, this is expected, so let's just assume and accept that fact and let it be.\n\nAlso here is another important factor: Please, please let's IGNORE invitro fertilization and CLONING for this question.  So let's assume the world has \n\nno technology to have test tube babies or cloned babies.\n\n\nOk here we go!\n\nWhat I want to find out is:\n\n\nA)\n\nWould polygamy, polyandry, polygyny, etc. etc. rule the world now? What 'system and structure' would be the most \"fair\"? or will it be just pockets of \n\ncommunes being one structure or the other?\n\n-Would those Fertile females be revered as gods and queens where both men and women beg them to give birth to their babies (want them to be surrogate \n\nmoms)? \n- Would there be kingdoms of Mothers being the matriarch for the commune / country / community?\n-Or would fertile females be subjected to being baby producing machines and held as slaves in a dystopian society?\n\n- Would the usual family structure of Wife/Husband + children dissolve and give way to Group and/or Line Marriages?\n- Would 1 Wife marry to 10 husbands and they have a commune all to themselves? (this will produce a LOT of Half Siblings).\n- Or would 1 Wife and 1 Husband produce 10 of their OWN babies and give away 5 of them for adoption to lucky couples?? (if this happens, those adopted \n\nchildren must remember from which Mother he/she came from so that they won't accidentally marry a related brother or sister, correct? - one would \n\nassume \n\nthey have to have a really good system of pedigree information kept).\n\n- All those structures would work wouldn't you say?; any other more interesting structures anyone can think and conjure up?\n\n\n\nB)\n\nNow: what would be the ramifications of any new structures / systems?\n\nLet's make this simple shall we? Hypothetically.\n\nIf there were 1000 men and 1000 women.  but only 10% of those women are fertile.  \n\n- CAN the population sustain its numbers over 100 years? 500 Years?  1000 years?\n- WOULD the population GROW exponentially eventually? (I assume not right?)\n- WILL there be potential incest?  Imagine, all the half brothers and half sisters all marry OUTside of the family line (which is no risk of incest), \n\nbut then what if the 2nd or 3rd generations crosses BACK to the original family line?  Is this possible? (I know that everyone is pretty much related \n\non our Earth anyway - but my question is in OUR Hypothetical scenario here, would incest be more of a risk)\n- I am correct to assume that there will be a huge Majority of both, men and women, that will die childless, albeit they can still have a happy \n\nmarriage with each other.\n\n\nC)\n\nNow let's assume this happens to a Capitalist society such as ours.  Would this collapse the whole economic capitalist system?\n\nWhat if this was an anarcho-communistic society?  Would this society operate better vs all types of systems?\n\nSince Children would be a SCARCITY, would you assume the worse would happen? \n\nWhat is the worst case scenario?  Would we see a Hierarchy / oligarchy / Totalitarian society where those who can give birth (and their husbands) will \n\njust rule and exploit the world?\n\nWhat is the best case scenario / structure you can come up with that is fair to all and bring order to the masses in the goal for peace.\n\n\n\nD)\n\nAnd a little off topic here, I apologize!, but: if couples are in a LINE marriage (different couples moving into the same household), then SOME of the \n\nchildren who are Siblings (children from TWO different couples), aren't related by blood, could they in theory, marry one another WITHIN the family \n\ncommune?  Will this be technically incest and if so, would the culture accept this, since the world is different now (being speculative).\n\n\nAgain, please have fun with this, ask any new questions and resolve them your way.  Would love to hear what ya'll have to say!  \n\nMuch Thanks!!!",

We have an anti-discrimination law which requires business owners to not deny service based on prejudicial reasons.\n2. I'd like to explain a problem we have in Israel. Since it is a Jewish state, some laws require religious restrictions upon businesses, whether they like it or not. For example, businesses get fined for opening on a Saturday; and they get fined for selling bread on Passover. So when you read the following, I'd like you to ask yourselves, if you think the laws I just mentioned should be removed (or not), and how does your answer fall in line with this? Assume there is a large portion of civilians who are secular and are not okay with this. I'm one of them and I believe if someone doesn't want to eat bread on Passover shouldn't buy any, and anyone who doesn't wanna do stuff on Saturday simply shouldn't; **but not force others to act the same**. Some would call this selective freedom if these laws were canceled but not the discriminatory one. Would you?\n\nLocal news showed that a restaurant had a sign that said \"For families and couples\". In effect, they denied access to homosexual couples (surprisingly they had no problems with lesbians). I was very strictly against this, and (as an Israeli Jew) I immediately analogized this sign to the \"No Jews allowed\" signs a few decades ago in various places, also similar to \"No Negroes allowed\", etc.\n\nI've been getting into a debate on Facebook on whether or not this is okay. I like to believe I'm an Egalitarian, and I believe in equality for everyone, regardless of race, religion, genitalia, or sexual preferences, etc. \n\nHowever in the debate, I could see a little bit of a problem. Seeing as the business is a private one, albeit in a public location, it is still owned privately by (for the sake of argument) one person. The same way I would not want access to specific individuals to my home and I would be in the right, no matter what criteria I choose to filter in, why is it different for a place of business? If I were to decide to deny homophobes, in current laws (in Israel) I would not be allowed to do so. I would be devaluing the person by their opinion. \n\nSo what is the attribute that differentiates a home from a business? Assuming the person owns the property in its entirety and otherwise is a law abiding citizen, what makes it wrong for them to tell certain people to take their business elsewhere? In effect, that person is being limited of their freedom in favor of someone else's.\n\nAgain I disagree with that statement, but I'm trying to get a better grasp of it.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

Supposing Hillary wins the election come November, is it problematic that that means that Bill Clinton will, by necessity, be back in the white house? As Hillary herself demonstrated, the spouse of the president has been an active political participant and there's a very reasonable chance that he will be just as politically involved as she was in the role. Bill would be put in a position to sway policy that is pretty unprecedented. There have been former presidents who served in other political offices in the past, but I could see how being the spouse of the current president as a former president could be much more powerful than being a senator or representative as a former president. He would have a greater sway on all cabinet and supreme court justice appointments as well as having a more direct involvement in foreign policy and national security, and most importantly, he is more aware of the intricacies of such matters than any first lady has been. \n\nAnd while it may be brushed off as a silly point of discussion, I think it is more prescient than people give credence: What will he be called? while many trot out some tongue-in-cheek \"first mister\" suggestion, I think the answer is \"president\", as that is the honorific used for former presidents (i.e. president Carter is still called President Carter despite not being the current president). They may tack a \"former\" onto it, but I think the fact that people will refer to Bill as president clinton regardless of what his former title is is an issue. ",

        "text": "Hello. This may be a controversial issue that we will be discussing. I apologise in advance for the long post.\n\nI'm an international student in Canada, or more precisely Québec, and I have acquainted with the opinions of a few groups here regarding the integration of minorities into the society of the \"majority\". Some \"Québécois de souche\", as we call white Québécois of French Canadian descent here, argue that certain ethnocultural minorities refuse to be integrated into the common francophone culture (based on interculturalism) and solely want to be isolated from \"civilisation\" to preserve their cultures. These ethnocultural minorities include Indigenous people, especially younger generations involved in drugs and alcoholism (in contrast with older generations who actively fought for legal recognition), and Muslims, for whom white people consider \"regressive\" and \"undemocratic\" because of their religious belief and practices. The \"majority\" society even fears minorities' take-over of their institutions and \"enslave\" them with alien values.\n\nAs an atheist, I don't want any religious groups to overpower the secular state. But as an apprentice in academia, I believe in inclusiveness and negotiation to reach compromise and mutual understanding to face current challenges together, and the state should be seen as a symbol of unity, even a conflict mediator (too idealistic, I know...) However, I often find myself in a moral and philosophical, even existential, predicament, since there are people who are living these social realities in Québec and who offer me insightful peeks into the current situation, whereas I am in the academic world where professors are still trying to understand and explain the processes leading to certain phenomena, such as terrorism, Islamophobia, xenophobia, etc., in a gradual and continuous way. So I'm stuck between the spontaneity of public opinion and world events, and the gradualism of academia, and hence don't really know where to stand. I'm certainly aware of the prestige of academia, but in a world where there is a multitude of truth claims, who am I as an apprentice to speak on behalf of others?\n\nMoreover, as an immigrant, I DO want to be integrated into the Québec society and contribute. I respect the rule of law and I believe in democratic values. I believe in mutual respect and freedom of expression to contribute to healthy discussions on current collective challenges. But I find it disheartening how distrustful and fearful some \"Québécois de souche\" are towards Muslims in particular, following terrorist acts in the name of Islam. One of my professors who is a \"Québécois de souche\" even said in class that minorities needed to make an effort to integrate into the francophone majority, and the state had to cut social welfare spending to prevent unemployed/homeless people from \"abusing\" this form of generosity. \n\nI know that no religion is homogeneous, as there are more \"progressive\" and open streams in all religions, as well as extremist wings. Yet the demonisation of one minority group just because of acts committed by a minority within that minority doesn't make sense to me. Québec politics revolves a lot around the notion of \"survival of the francophone majority and culture\", but paradoxically, the question of identity also encompasses other groups, too. In a world where globalisation generates anonymity and assimilates people into the flows of consumerism, identity re-emerges so people can find a place in this globalised world and feel empowered. But does it mean that one identity is more important than another/other identity(ies)?\n\nSo, how to \"reconcile\" ethnocultural identity and the entry and participation in the democratic public sphere in Western societies, often characterised as liberal, secular, conflict-free, and enriched by communicative reasoning? Should one abstain from one's ethnocultural identity to be fully considered a cooperating member of society, as a citizen? ",
