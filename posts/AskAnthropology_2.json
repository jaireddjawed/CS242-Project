I already know a good bit about the “big” cultures like Arabs, Chinese, Western European, Egypt, Greece, Rome, etc., but I feel like I don’t know enough about human cultures, traditions, and cultural practices to make a three-dimensional world. I also love anthropology and history in general so I’d love to learn more about it anyway. Does anyone know a good educational show where each episode teaches and talks about a different (preferably more obscure) culture or civilization, whether they be historic or modern? I would love to find something that presents information like Kurzgesagt or The Infographics Show, but I would also be happy with more in in depth like something you may find on Discovery.

However I would anticipate that the specific research questions might be narrowed down/changed after initial fieldwork. As far as I know, the application for PhD programmes should be better sent out by the end of this year, before doing the project for the masters dissertation which might help narrowing down the research project for the PhD programme. \n\nI wonder how specific a research proposal should be while applying and also any suggestions on the timetable/steps in writing the proposal for PhD programmes? If there are anyone who could share their experiences of deciding on their PhD topics, that would be great help!\n\nThanks!",

Most of it is from the various cultures in Alaska, Canada and the Pacific Northwest. He worked there and befriended several local First Nations artists, which started his collecting hobby.\n\nWe had some records of who made what and from what culture the artist came, but I cant for the life of me identify this sculpture ( https://imgur.com/a/9h5iaWb ). It looks more Central American to me than Inuit. He was born in Mexico so he had some art from Latin America but that was the minority of the pieces. The material appears to be a soft, red, volcanic stone.\n\nNone of my family can remember him buying it or really even remember seeing it before (probably because its small and he had a lot of sculptures). Something about it speaks to me and so I was hoping to figure out where he comes from.\n\nThanks!",

Then, the 3rd and 4th digits may also become more coordinated. This would look like a hamsa.\n\nCurrently, the hand orients toward the thumb. The pinky is strong, yet also short, thin and follows the ring finger, which is comparably weak and uncoordinated. The hand is easy to grab with, but is difficult to form a cup. \n\nThe pinky already has the job of opposing the hand in this way, but it is poorly shaped to do so. To hold an object by it's base, the pinky often strains to lift, and can't  properly face upward. Thus, the digit's bones may strain, and gripping can be more unbalanced.\n\nSo, I'm wondering why this hasn't warranted for the digit to develop more useful in this way.",

I know that Judaism, Christianity, and Islam can be 'grouped' as Abrahamic religions, and that some religions in India or the Far East also share similar concepts to each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs such, I'm looking for some resources that could help answer the following questions:\n\n* Is there a way of placing religions into different groups?\n* Can ancient religions with little/no written record be reconstructed?\n* Does the geographic spread of different religions show similar results to linguistic or genetic maps?\n* How do religions change over time? How common is it for beliefs and stories to be added to or removed from a religion? Can religions merge?\n* Is there a reason why certain religions have survived better than others? Do the world's most popular religions have something in common?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf possible, I'd prefer something that briefly covers many topics and mentions less popular belief systems, rather than something specifically focussed on the current major world religions. I'm happy to take any recommendations of books, documentaries, youtube channels, audiobooks, lecture series, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, if you know partial or full answers to any of these questions, then please let me know. Equally, if your knowledge doesn't directly answer my questions, but you think it may be of interest, then you can respond as well.",

After getting the Anarchists all riled up with the claim that \"no major civilization in history has given us a functioning example of anarchy in action\",  I figured I'd come over here and say the same thing to people who know what they're talking about.\n\nPrimarily I'm talking about large gatherings of humans in the era of recorded history within which heirarchy was actively eliminated from political, social, economic, and spiritual life. Basically any examples of pure anarchy that happen to have also allows for a social cohesion to develop to a level one might consider equivalent to a nation. I know this is vague, but I don't mean to make it so to exclude any examples that may fit. I want the biggest, closest thing out there.\n\nI'm also interested to know what examples, with reliable evidence, we have prior to recorded history. I know that we've inferred non-heirarchical hunter gatherer societies to have existed, but what are the specifics of those?\n\nIf I'm asking a question for which the answer is too large, I'm also accepting reading material such that I can do my own work. I don't believe I am given that dozens of Anarchists, enraged as they were, could only come up with the Zapatistas as an example of anything close to what I'm asking for, but hey. Who knows. Maybe I'm forgetting about that one that showed us all that heirarchies aren't actually a natural state of being, and that we're all just brainwashed.",

        "text": "Most anthropologists think religion originated between 40k-100k years ago or maybe even further back. Both Paleolithic Homo sapiens and Neanderthals buried their dead with grave goods, which suggested a belief in an afterlife. Ocher in rock and powdered form found in Homo habitation sites is thought to indicate ritual purpose. Cave paintings, carvings (Venus of Willendorf) and musical instruments (bone flutes) also imply ritual behaviors and an aesthetic awareness that informed a religious sensibility. \n\nA popular explanation for the function of religion is that it fosters social cohesion and cooperation. However, Frans de Waal and others show social cohesion mechanisms like morality and empathy as well as familial bonding, territoriality and dominance hierarchy already existed in our mammalian predecessors. Since we inherited these predispostions from our last common ancestor, why did we need religion to promote social cohesion and cooperation? What happened around 100k years ago that would have necessitated religion’s putative social benefits? \n\nIt couldn’t be tool-making or tool use since that had already been going on for 2-3 million years. Of course stone technologies continued to improve, but that itself doesn’t justify the need for better sociality. It couldn’t be controlling fire or group hunting since they, too, had already been happening for far longer than evidence of religion.\n\nMany anthropologists cite the Big Gods theory, but that only matters when populations started growing past tribal densities after the agricultural revolution and long after religion already had a foothold. I just don’t see it. And yet the social cohesion rationale persists.",

My previous degree was a professional degree in Christian ministry. \n\nMy current project is ethnographic, but my fieldwork was conducted during COVID19 lockdowns and so my data is mostly interview with a few handful of trips to some churches that I was interested in. It's great to read thick description in other peoples' writings but frankly I have no thick description. I am not an insider to these groups. I only have interview data, some online videos, and a few pages of field notes.\n\nI'm also struggling a lot to write. My project is exploratory so there isn't much secondary research to engage with. I feel that the project is doomed but I'm still trying really hard to make it work. Any advice on the problems I've talked about above would be greatly appreciated.",

That's still quite broad, but some specific points are:\n\n- How does/did a &lt;insert settlement unit here&gt; manifest in &lt;insert geography here&gt; (with reference to a cultural/temporal context)? Eg. Indigenous villages in the Himalayas, nomadic settlements in the Mongolian steppe, indigenous Amazonian villages, etc.\n\n- What are the means of transportation? What destinations do people travel to, when, how often, and why? How is that shaped by the geography?\n\n- By what mechanism(s) is political power exerted in &lt;insert geography here&gt;? How is this shaped by the geographical context?\n\nAll of these questions need to be specific to a culture and time, in addition to geography, of course. So, whichever you have references on, I'd appreciate. Also, keywords to help my search would also be much appreciated.\n\nThanks.",

They are \"Middle Easterners\" and are the ancestors of MOST modern Egyptians - their closest relatives are Peninsular Arabs and Levantine Arabs; They are also related to the Greeks and Sardinians.  Which means that these \"Nuftian\" people and their descendants are the progenitors of the Pharaonic, Greek and Arab civilizations.*  \n\n*Other European (ie Roman) and Indo-Europeans (ie Iranian) civilizations were influenced by Nuftians genetically and culturally, but they were not of pure Nuftian origin but a mixture of Nuftian and multiple other Neolithic groups genes and cultures.  North Africans (Berber) diverged earlier from this group (Nuftians/EEF) and later \"re-converged\" with this group through interbreeding with South Europeans, who were the result of EEF and other European admixtures*   \n\n*Sub-Saharan African groups are very distant genetically from the above peoples and all non-Africans, as they have stayed secluded in Sub-Saharan Africa and never migrated out of Africa or interbred with Neanderthals like all non-Africans 60,000-90,000 years ago.*\"",

        "text": " \n\nI am a young western european guy that recently started some communication studies, in which I've had philosophy classes. I am deeply atheist. But here is my wonder...\n\nWhy is it the case that none of those philosophers (I am thinking about Pascal and Kant) could just simply imagine that God could not exist ? Those guys have that ability of putting into perspective everything they see, to the point of wondering if the people they see walking in the streets are real people. So what about God ? Why is there no sane criticism about its own existence ?\n\nPascal's bet is interesting and even managed to make me wonder if I shouldn't start believing in God, since that's the always winning scenario. But this wager has a very important flaw for me: it takes the existence of a god for granted and universal, intrinsic to the very reason for our existence. It is more important to me to first prove the existence of God than to speculate on how one would have to live if a God ever existed.\n\nIf I invent a divine steward whose existence no one can know because it is a pure invention, if I manage to convince a large group of people that this steward exists, what would be the interest for totally outside and foreign people for this deity to consider scenarios of how to live depending on that totally invented deity's existence ?\n\nTo put into another perspective, I am as I said atheist, but I do wonder why every single community in the world and in the time ALWAYS, 100% of the time, believe in something irrational. Why did humanity evolve about something it did not even see once, nor did it see its action once either. How can one be so deeply conviced that thing exists.\n\nIt might sound very selfish, but if I can live a normal life without believing in anything, why could noone else do that in the past as well ?\n\nWhen we studied Socrates it blowed my mind, because this guy lived 2000 years ago, and his philosphy and his way of thinking is like he wrote that yesterday.\n\nI understand that for a long time, noone could read, there was no education, relgion was in the center of everything, therefore it is easier for one to believe in irrational stuff. But if Socrates's logic is still so logical today, it means that anyone could also think \"straight\" during all that time, during all those 2000 years.\n\nSorry if all of this is a bit confused, English isn't my native language and those are not easy concepts to explain. Have a nice day !",

I know some communities practice a form of living death where dishonored persons are metaphorically made dead and practically cut off.",
