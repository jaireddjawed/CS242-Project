        "text": "Think about some big popular games. Super Meat Boy, the Call of Duty series, CS:GO, and even League of Legends are all games that all have unique replay systems. Different games can have different controls, different worlds, different physics, but so many of them make use of a replay feature; tools that either replay what happened moments before you died, remember how you played a specific level, or maybe it stores a whole game worth of replay. The main question here - what method would be the most efficient in creating said replays? Would saving the input each frame be memory-efficient? Would saving a live video of the gameplay be time-efficient? What different methods exist for different games that make *their* replay system effective - and what tools would you use in a game you're designing?\n\nOther things that are interesting to discuss as a branch of this - how do replays affect the games? FPS games will use the replay feature to reveal a killer's location, potentially eliminating an element of stealth. Games like Super Meat Boy use it purely as a partially comedic element as well as a way to see how you improved over multiple attempts. Different games use their replay systems differently - how do they affect the game?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/6xukzz/is_there_a_data_structure_that_is_basically_a/",
        "text": "One of the biggest disadvantages of linked lists is that they are implemented over non-contiguous memory. This causes cache misses which slows performance. The traditional linked list implementation (as far as I know) consists of a bunch of nodes, where each node contains the value of the element and pointers to the next and previous nodes in the list. The problem is that when a new element is added, a new node is created somewhere in memory that could be quite far from the rest of the nodes, causing cache misses. But can't this be avoided?\n\nThe basic idea is that the linked list would be initialized with an expected capacity, say, C. Allocate memory for C contiguous nodes in memory. By default, the memory for these nodes would not be used (even though the memory is allocated). So keep track of these \"free\" nodes in, say, a free list. Then, whenever you wanted to insert a new element, instead of choosing some random memory location, you would choose one of the memory locations from the free list. The chosen memory location will be relatively close to the location of the other nodes. Thus, cache misses *should* be reduced (right?). So the implementation that I'm thinking of will be virtually identical to traditional linked lists; the only difference is that, when adding a new element/node, the memory will be chosen from a pre-allocated section of contiguous memory.\n\nOf course, there will be some additional work to do when the container exceeds the capacity. There would have to be some re-allocating, copying, etc. just as when a C++ vector, hash map, etc. exceeds the initially allocated capacity.\n\nOther than that, it seems like this retains the advantages of traditional linked lists (e.g. insertion to or removal from any index in constant time) while minimizing cache misses. Am I missing something? I searched around for a data structure like this but found *nothing*. There are 2 possible explanations for this: (1) I'm a genius and no one has thought of this before, or (2) there is something fundamentally wrong with this data structure idea (or my understanding of cache misses, memory, etc,), but I can't figure it out. EDIT: there's also a third possible explanation: this data structure *does* exist somewhere, but my Google searching skills have failed me.\n\nThoughts?",

I'm wondering if this is a good investment of my money, or if I should get a more powerful Windows laptop instead for a similar price. I already have a solid Windows desktop, so in my head I'm thinking that it's good to have access to both operating systems, but I also know that for 1300$, there are much more powerful options out there when compared to a MacBook Pro. So my question is: is it worth sticking with the MacBook in my situation? How important is it having access to both OSX and Windows (and even Linux I've heard?)? Thanks in advance! :-)\n\n**EDIT**: Bonus question. In general, what kind of specs should I be looking to prioritize in a build/laptop as a CS student? I play video games and stuff, so I want to strike a good balance between my CS needs and my hobbies, if that's relevant.",
