        "text": "Hello!\nWhen you have a IC in a smallish package, say a SOIC for example, how do you conform with IPC or UL standards regarding creepage and clearance? \nI think IPC-2221B and some of the UL rules require between 1.1 and 1.25mm clearance for exposed tracks and pins with 250V between them.\n\nHow would i go about complying with those? I can only think of 3 options:\n1: Conformal coating, this seems the best option as long as the standards accept it.\n2: Milling, this only increase the creepage. You could insert an insulation shield in the slot to also increase clearance.\n3: Using a bigger package, but most of the chips i am looking at are either in SOIC or smaller packages (surface mount gate drivers).\n\nMy concern is with a +15V pin right next to a +250V pin. But the part itself (high + low side gate driver, NCV5183DR2G) is rated for up to +600V, which would give a potential of up to 585V between the leads.\nHow common is it to use conformal coating when designing boards, do you usually design the board with coating in mind, or do you use coating as a last minute fix or to gain extra margins after the board design is done?\n\nThe board itself is a standard FR4 board with what i assume is a very standard solder resist, and i have yet to understand how the different material and pollution classes work.",

I'll probably be doing these posts for about a week (since I'll be solving 7 of those previous entrance exams). I'm posting this so I can double-check it.\n\nI also have some coding and algorithms questions that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7mm8c2/questions_on_c_algorithms_computer_arhitecture/).\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23) Let a processor with Von-Neumann architecture have a pipeline with two segments. How many cycles does the below code require:\n\n          LOAD R2, (X)\n          ADD R1,R2,R3\n          B X\n          ADD R1,R1,R1\n          ADD R1,R1,R1\n          ADD R3,R2,R1\n       X ADD R1,R1,R1\n          B Y\n          LOAD R1,(X)\n       Y ADD R1,R2,R3\n\nI got the answer 9, but the answers listed are 6, 10, 12, 20 and 22. Here is how I calculated it so you can tell me where I went wrong. I named my units \"Fetch\" and \"Execute\":\n\nFetch      |  LOAD  |  ADD   |     B    |   ADD  |  ADD (X label)  |    B    |   LOAD  |   ADD  |   -\nExecute   |     -     |  LOAD  |  ADD  |    B     |          -            |  ADD  |     B      |     -     |  ADD\n\nThe thing I find suspicious here are the cycles right after I branch - I think my understanding fails here. Any help?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24) Some processor has a 5-stage pipeline: Fetch, Decode, ALU operations execution, Memory access, Saving results into registry. Which of the following hazards is possible here?\n\nPossible answers: *Von Neumann hazard, Control hazard*, *Structural hazard, Data hazard*, *Von Neumann hazard, Stack hazard*, *Harward hazard, Register hazard*, *Register hazard, Stack hazard*.\n\nI know nothing about hazards, so I will visit the book I read on computer architecture once again. However, I am including this here so I have easier reference when reviewing for the exam.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n30) In an IP network IPv4 is used. During the transfer of the datagram whose TTL = 5 no error was made. What will the router do upon recieving the datagram, if the path towards the destination IP address is contained in the routing table?\n\n**My answer: The router will set TTL = 4 and pass the datagram to the next network node.**\n\nIn other answers there are additional parts, such as the router computing the checksum or sending a ICMP message, but if I recall correctly ICMP and checksum check are only done by the destination router, not the intermediate routers. Correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks in advance!",

I've spent most of my career on the analog side of things, putting together system schematics and layouts. I have a good understanding of digital components (WiFi/Bluetooth SoCs, Processors, MCUs) on a systems level, but my extent of programming knowledge is debugging example code.\n\nAs a hobby, I've made a handful of automation and robotics projects using RasPi (Python), and Arduino, but always found that I'm gluing together and modifying existing code found on the web. I can understand C and C++ programs, but can't write them from scratch.\n\nMy goal is to reach a level of understanding that will allow me to write embedded software and firmware for a living. Preferably with a focus on IoT hardware - both on the sensor and gateway side.\n\nI came up with a list of skills needed for embedded roles based on job postings:\n\n- Experience with Linux kernel and user space, Ubuntu Core, Yocto\n- Experience with OpenBSD\n- Experience with RTOS\n- C and C++ Experience\n- C# experience\n- Assembly Language experience\n- Cross compilation environments and virtualization tools\n- Experience with ARM MCUs and processors\n- Experience developing drivers, bootloaders, BSP\n- Git\n- Python Scripting\n- Understanding of full software development life cycle\n- Implementing state machines\n- Wifi and bluetooth firmware development\n- Data logging programs\n- Analyzing OTA sniffer logs\n- JTAG experience\n- Eclipse, Visual Studio IDE\n- Android Application development\n- ThreadX RTOS experience\n- CAN, SPI, UART, I2C, USB experience\n\nQuestions for you:\n\n1. How should I prioritize learning these skills?\n2. Do you have any tips on courses, books, or online resources that I should use? Where should I start?\n3. Is this something I should look into going back to school for, or is it pretty straightforward to learn this on my own?\n4. Are there any tools I can use to emulate embedded linux or FreeRTOS on specific microcontrollers or microprocessors so I don't need to carry development boards with me on the go?\n5. How can I gauge if I am ready to move into a full time development role?\n\nThanks for your help!",

In order to combat this issue, the product's performance is reduced unannounced to the consumer. Some important facts to include are that this product has a difficult time replacing the battery (however, it might be too costly to make it easily replaceable in the first place) and that the slow-down was not announced publicly to consumers.\n\nTo put it short, I am a graduating CpE student and would like to know the opinions of professionals on (what I assume) reducing clock speeds on a product without consumer consent in order to maintain functionality in a device. My opinion about this would be as simple as a computer throttling under high temperatures, thus there is no dishonestly in terms the actual usage. How would this abide/not abide to IEE code of ethics?\n\nEdit: just to be clear this is not for homework I'd just like to hear the opinions of others.",

The answer seems to suggest so when we assume input resistance is infinite and output resistance is finite. I don't understand 3 main things: \n1. The nodal analysis equation makes no sense, do they just assume A(vd) = v(out)? Is this because it is ideal? If the input resistance is infinite then what is the point of v(d)? Shouldn't v(d) just equal 0 since no current passes through the input resistor? \n2. According to the detailed circuit, if the noninverting terminal is placed above the inverting terminal, then the dependent source in the internal circuitry of the op-amp also has the positive terminal above the negative. According to figure 6.55, the inverting terminal is above the noninverting terminal, so shouldn't the dependent source be inverted as well, i.e. shouldn't v(out) = -A(vd)?\n3. How did they find the relationship between the open loop gain and closed loop gain? I am referring to the equation: (0.98)(6.6) = A(vd)/0.45? \n\nPlease help!",

Assembly isn't free, and neither are the boards, but with reasonable manufacturing tolerances they should be pretty cheap.\n\nThis obviously isn't a revenue generation project - and it isn't meant to be. If it broke even I'd be happy. Is anyone interested in something like that?\n\nIf so: What would you want on it? A set of header pins to plug into a breadboard... anything else?

That's great for people with $50 - I'm talking about someone who might not think they have the background, or isn't sure, and can only afford $10 to give it a go, who wants to see something work that has reprogrammable logic, and it might get them interested in pursuing it further (or who just want to learn something).\n\nLet me know either way, thanks all!",

Later, when I moved onto the register part, I was not able to be successful. I have went through the circuit couple of times and it looks like the wiring is correct. The \"Load\" signal which takes 8-bit value from the bus to the register is the one doing the problem and the \"Enable\" works perfectly as of now. \n   I am attaching a picture of the circuit and would love if you could point out any problems and ask me any related questions...\n   I am following this youtuber as my guidance to this project : http://www.youtube.com/user/eaterbc?ytbChannel=null\n  The register which he had built is : https://youtu.be/CiMaWbz_6E8\n   Also, I have done the exact same built that he has done.\n   I am using the SN74LS245N as my buffer and my 4-bit D Type Flip-Flop is HD74LS173AN.\n \n\n  If you look over my model of the register, you will notice 3 jumper wires. The top right(yellow) is the load signal.(tied to power unless I want to use it because these are inverted signals). next to it(dark blue) is the clear signal for both the flip flop's... the bottom left(yellow) is the enable signal(same principle as the load signal but this time it outputs data back to the bus).\n\nThank You.\n\nImage 1 : https://imgur.com/sYm01cQ\nImage 2 : https://imgur.com/CfizMbx\nImage 3 : https://imgur.com/AGaS3L1\nImage 4 : https://imgur.com/ilvfHDi",

I know that meters will probably be completely different since I mostly dealt with distribution services, meter programming, and CT installation. Relay seems like it has more helpful experience because I worked mostly with 115-230 kV protection schemes. Will any of this prior experience help with my new co-op. I know that much isn’t expected of a co-op/intern but I feel like it would be advantageous for me to have some knowledge when I start.

        "text": "Hello all, I am currently a 2nd-year electrical engineering technology student. Going into this fourth semester, I decided to drop out of electrical engineering and switch into the \"tech\" major. I did this because I hated my Circuits I class, and Physics II was alright - I wanted to do the more hands-on application, integrating theory with a more tangible outcome. However, I do have an interest in theoretical mathematics. I also have an interest in audio applications - since I am switching into EET from EE, I figured I would switch my minor (Music and Tech) to another one, since there is an \"audio-focused\" BS option in EET. So I am now enrolled in Acoustics (math) for next semester, but want to pick a minor. I am unsure if I should pick math as a minor, or environmental science. Preferably, I'd like to get my master's, whether in math, audio engineering, or anything, after a few years working in the field.\n\nSomeone set me straight. I like the coding side, i.e. C, VHDL, Verilog, but its effects seem more tangible in the \"tech\" degree classes, hence my switch. So why would I have an intangible interest in mathematics? What kind of jobs could a recent EET graduate get with this interest set? Furthermore, what types of theoretical math is used in digital systems? I have seen concepts of multivariable calculus in Antenna design, for example, and linear algebra in many disciplines. Is most theoretical engineering math applied physics? I have so many questions.\n\nFinally, would this type of job be only available at big corporations - i.e. not a start-up business? Thank you for your time and effort.\n\nEDIT:\nI know of the repercussions and biases against this college major. To be honest I do not care much if my salary is much higher. I figure by taking classes I enjoy I can truly learn the material at a better quality. Luckily, the EET major is ranked much higher than the EE degree at my school anyhow.\n\nTo rephrase a bit, how is theoretical math used in EE, and how can I apply these interests?\n\nEDIT:\nI am a RIT student.",

Wondering if anyone would have any insight or advise for what types of EE analog problems/concepts to brush up on before having the on-site death grip interview with multiple engineers.  I already had the phone screen, and just did the take-home \"quiz\", I think I knocked it out of the park.  I've been reviewing op-amp basics, transistor basics, basics of signal conditioning/filtering, etc.  Anything I should specifically watch out for?\n\nAnyway, thanks for any advise/help in advance!",

        "text": "Hey all, \n\nI wanted to get some input on switching from a wall wart output to a battery output without losing power in a Raspberry Pi project. Mainly because this could cause some data corruption on the SD. \n\nCurrently my plan is to use the LTC4115 dual ideal diodes to connect both the sources. I initially did this holding both enables together, but found that there is a small delay (few ms) in the switch when this happens causing the Pi to shut off.\n\nMy plan was to add a lot of bulk capacitance (~100mF) in order to hold over during the switch. I ran a simulation on LTSpice and it seemed to work fine, but I wanted to get some input or ideas from someone who's maybe done something similar before. \n\nThanks! ",

        "text": "I have been working for an engineering consulting company for the past couple years, starting after I graduated with my BSEE. I don't do any direct design or engineering myself as the role is mostly limited to review and occasionally testing. Ultimately I would like to move on to a different job doing some form of electrical engineering design, preferably in power or semiconductors.\n\n\nWhat I am worried about is the fact that I'm getting experience in project management, testing, and quality assurance type things, but nothing really in electrical engineering and design. I don't see myself working at this  job/industry for the entirety of my career. How can I develop these types of skills so that by the time I'm ready to move on to a different job I have something to show potential employers that I can even do design stuff? I apologise in advance if this type of question has been answered before dozens of times, but I'd really like some direction here as I feel like it could hurt my career in the future if I'm not proactive about my interests. Thanks!",
