        "text": "I'm not working in tech support, I'm more on the dev side, but I'm basically the one everyone calls when they have a problem with their computer, so if this posts doesn't belong here, feel free to remove it.\n\nAnyway... my mom recently retired from her job. She's been using a computer at work for at least 20, maybe 25 years. To give you an idea, she even started with command lines on DOS. Now, you'd think she's damn good with computers, with all that experience. Well, she's not. To this day, I'm still amazed how little she knows about anything software/hardware related.\n\nA few years ago, I setup a small, shitty laptop at her home so she can browse the news/weather websites and check her emails. Thing runs on win XP and is incredibly slow, but whatever, she likes it, cause she knows where to click, even though it takes two entire minutes to load up Chrome.\nShe sometimes call me when she has a problem, but to give her credit, she never tries anything new. She pretty much never does anything else than what she already knows (thank fucking god).\n\nTo give you an idea, I'm the one who was tired of this old computer when I had to \"fix\" it. So much that I told her I'd get her a new laptop, something with better performance. I ended up giving her my old gaming laptop. 17\"screen, good cpu, even a good gpu and a SSD. This one can load win10 + google chrome in under 7 seconds, and I couldn't wait for her to finally give up on that awful old computer and enter the 21st century with the rest of humanity. Well, guess what. She barely uses it. Why, you ask? Because, you see, it \"doesn't have Mahjong\". She downloaded some fucking Mahjong game from the internet, but it's only XP compatible. I told her there was probably a trillion free Mahjong games for win10, or even \"in the browser\". But nope, the others are no good, cause the colors and the size of the tiles are different. Long story short, she now uses 2 computers. One Corvette to check her emails, and a broken tricycle to play Mahjong. It kills me inside just to think about it.\n\nSo recently, she wanted to move the better computer from one room to another. I told her I'd take care of it. She laughed and said \"come on, I can do that\".  I set it up to be mostly wireless (WiFi, printer), so there's really only one thing to unplug/plug : the power cord. I trusted she can do this. The next day she calls me and tells me that the computer is \"slow and darker\". You guessed it, it went in power saving mode. And why is that? Because the battery was very low. Turns out one side of the power cord was correctly plugged into the wall outlet. Yeah, she had that part covered. The other part, though... well, it was plugged into the network (RJ45) outlet of the computer.\n\nI couldn't even make all that up. I find it incredible that you can spend the majority  of your career using a tool and still not know ANYTHING about it. It's to a point where she just actively refuses to learn a single thing about computers. \n\nSo, to all you tech support guys out there, enduring this on a daily basis, I'm so, so sorry for you.\nPS: Sorry for mediocre English, not a native.",

Normally the angry customers, the insults, and the attitudes just roll off my back.\nHowever, today was a rough day personally for me already, and I was a little on edge to start with. \n\nI had a woman call in and tell me that her phones are out of order. She lives in a rural area and tells me she needs the phones back on immediately because her fathers pacemaker is connected to the phone lines. \n\nI set up a ticket for her right away and schedule her an appointment for the soonest available date - March 22nd. Due to the high volume and lack of techs in the area this is the soonest available date. Because of the medical nature of this situation I immediately reach out to her local dispatch office to request an escalation if one is available. \n\nNow, our company’s policy is that we cannot GUARANTEE a sooner date with these escalations, but we’ll try to move them up if available. The escalation is added to the ticket although the dispatcher advised me that it’s “not likely” due to the heavy workload. \n\nI apologize to the customer, and advise her of her appointment information. \n\nShe starts yelling at me (understandably upset, however my hands are tied at this point), and asks me what my name is again. I provide my first name and she immediately yells “WELL YOU KNOW WHAT ——, IF MY DAD DIES I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT IT IS YOUR FAULT. YOUR FAULT.” And then hangs up. \n\nI understand being upset, but who would say something like that? I actually had to walk away from my desk because I started crying. A lot of my calls were like that today, and it was a rough one. I wish more people had some empathy for the employees who do the best they can and are just following protocol.  \n\nEdit: Thanks for the responses! Just found this sub and it’s my first post! I feel like I found my new home lol ",

        "text": "Hey TFTS. LTL, FTP. I'm a programmer so I know how to copy paste. :)\n\n*Quick backstory: I suffer from multiple conditions resulting in extreme sleep deprivation so I will be paraphrasing and getting stuff wrong, especially chronology. Sorry about that. I'm also currently working on even less sleep than normal.*\n\nNot-so-quick Setting: I am the user and the tech in this story my uncle, a retired engineer, will back me up.\n \nLet's go back a couple days ago when the power and internet went out.  \nMy UPS switches to battery and I rush to save and shutdown my computer because not only do users lie but UPSs **always** lie, 80 minutes my ass.  \nPortable generator gets turned on and most of the house has electricity again.  \nUPSs, one for internet and the other for phones/my computer, flip back and forth occasionally and I think nothing of it. Of course they die.  \nI get confused and turn one on again. It just beeps at me. Nothing connected gets turned on it's just beeping.  \nI unplug it from the wall and it switches to battery and the light turns on. Good?  \nI plug it back into the wall. Fixed? No. Still only battery.  \nFilled up the generator because that was the only thing I could think of. Fixed? No. I give up.  \nI go to \"sleep\".  \nAfter I got some \"rest\" I decided that the UPS... Well that doesn't make sense... Why the hell did I do that?  \n**SKIP**\nSo I see on the screen 63Hz. Why did I not look at the lit up screen when it was beeping at me?  \nAt some point I figure out the UPS will charge when it is off but not on and the surge protector side still work while it is off. 3Hz shouldn't do any harm right?  \nTurn computer on.  \n**Google-Foo ACTIVATE!**  \n... I forgot the internet was down as well as power. And no, the modem does not equal internet...  \nAfter a bit of playing around on my computer to pass the time I go downstairs to find the cable is back on. So internet is too right?  \nSwitch modem and router to the surge protector side and they turn on. Blinking, blinking, blinking... still blinking? Guess no internet. :(  \nGo upstairs to find my computer has internet. I was so surprised I went back down to the basement to check the light on the modem lol.  \n**Google-Foo ACTIVATE!**  \nSuccess!  \nDirty power... sensitivity setting... not on my UPS :(... inverter-generator... manual doesn't say and manufactureres don't seem to care...  \nSolution: Check manual for \"governor\"... nothing.  \nSolution: Call manufacturer to tell me where the governor is... It's how late? Tomorrow is Sunday?  \nSolution: Call uncle in the morning.\n\nSo the story of the \"slightly\" flawed monitor starts here.\n\nI turned on my computer the next morning and was greeted with an error, that I read this time, \"Check Connection\".  \nI followed instructions to no avail.  \nDVI-D cable doesn't work.  \nDVI-I cable doesn't work.  \nMini-HDMI cable doesn't work.  \nNo VGA port on my graphics card but there is one on my 10 year old laptop.  \nVGA port... WORKS!  \n\"No VGA port on my graphics card\"... Oh Yeah! I have an adapter somewhere!  \nTurns out the adapter... wait a sec... son of a!... I'm an idiot...  \nSo I thought the adapter wouldn't work because I was trying to plug it into the monitor... Adapters can also be, and usually are, plugged into the computer...  \nAnyway. I thought I couldn't use the adapter and I don't really have the money to replace the monitor so I was upset. I do have a second monitor but my workflow really requires 2 monitors.  \nTime to email/call uncle.  \n&gt; $Me: *explains*  \n&gt; $Uncle: No the extra 3Hz wont/shouldn't damage anything.  \n&gt; $Me: Well, can you help troubleshoot my monitor?  \n&gt; $Uncle: Sounds like it has the wrong input.  \n&gt; $Me: *Tries to select a different input*  \n&gt; $Me: The buttons don't work...  \n&gt; $Uncle: What?  \n&gt; $Me: None of the buttons work...  \n&gt; $Uncle: ...  \n&gt; $Me: VGA worked so lets see what happens if I plug that in.  \n*screen comes on*\n&gt; $Me: Well, the buttons work now... You think to make an error that your on the wrong input but you can't actually change the input unless your on a valid input... That is the stupidest design I've ever seen...  \n&gt; $Uncle: Try changing the input.  \n&gt; $Me: Auto-source is off and I just hit DVI without turning it on... my brain isn't quick enough. Same error as before BTW.  \n&gt; $Me: Wait! It helps if you plug the cable in.  \n&gt; $Uncle: Yes it does.  \n&gt; $Me: Still nothing. Wait a sec... It helps when you plug both sides of the cable in...\n&gt; $Uncle: *laughing*\n&gt; $Me: Still nothing.\nTurning the monitor off and on again using the power button didn't change the input back to VGA, I had to unplug it and plug it back in, which I never needed to before. Actually, I never needed to do that with anything before.  \nSo I don't have to go through that again I made sure auto-source was enabled this time.  \nRan through everything again and still had no luck.  \nI thanked my uncle for his time and hung up.  \nWell, time to start googling.  \nI login using my secondary monitor and the primary also starts working.  \n&gt; $Me: WTF?!\n\nTL;DR: Monitor doesn't allow you to change input if you are on the wrong input. Also, gets magically fixed by logging in.",

Today's call was exactly that situation.  \n\nCast of characters:  \n**$me** = me  \n**$student** = student IT front desk staff  \n**$caller** = frustrated caller (an assistant/intern for a science professor)  \n\nI'm out by the front desk finishing up assisting another user when **$student** calls over to me.  \n\n&gt;**$student:** Hey **$me**, I've got a caller with a weird problem... she can't get into an important computer and said that you've fixed this for her before. Can I put her through?  \n\n&gt;**$me:** Sure thing, let me just run back to my desk. *[runs back and picks up the line on hold]*  \n\n&gt;**$me:** Hi, this is **$me**, sorry to hear you're having problems accessing a computer. I got a brief run-down of what's going on, but could you just run through it once more for me?  \n\n&gt;**$caller:** This is really frustrating because this just happened last month. I keep trying to get on Wi-Fi with the new phone I just bought, but it won't accept my login. And when I try to connect with my computer, it says my account is locked. *[continues talking, attempting to describe everywhere she has attempted to sign in without luck... finally there is a brief pause where I can get a word in edgewise.]*  \n\n&gt;**$me:** I'd be happy to help with that. I can unlock your account for you, then we can try signing in again. *[launches AD tools and unlocks the user's account]* Okay, your account is unlocked now. Could you give it a shot?  \n\n&gt;**$caller:** It's not going to work, remember my account is locked.  \n\n&gt;**$me:** *[head, meet desk]* I just unlocked it for you. Could you try logging in again?  \n\n&gt;**$caller:** It's still not letting me in on my new phone, but I can sign in to stuff on my computer now.  \n\n&gt;**$me:** *[verifies that everything is good with her account from an AD perspective... which of course it is]* Okay, that's a bit odd. When you connect on your computer, is your password saved or are you typing it in manually?  \n\n&gt;**$caller:** It's saved.  \n\n&gt;**$me:** Could you try typing it in manually and log in again?  \n\n&gt;**$caller:** Now it's not taking my password! What did your system do?  \n\n&gt;**$me:** Hmm, interesting. Well, it sounds like we might need to reset your password. *[resets user's password to a default value using our internal password reset tool]* Could you please go to $InternalPasswordChangeURL and sign in using $SingleUsePassword as your password?  \n\n&gt;**$caller:** That worked. Now it's asking me to change my password.  \n\n&gt;**$me:** Okay, excellent. I'll stay on the line while you take care of that.  \n\n&gt;**$caller:** *[successfully changes password, then successfully connects her phone and computer to Wi-Fi]* Everything is working again now. But I'm frustrated that this keeps happening! What can you do to keep your system from locking me out?  \n\n&gt;**$me:** *[recalls that last month the user got locked out because the EXACT same thing happened]* Well, I'm sorry that this has been causing you so much frustration. It just seems that the password you were entering was slightly different from the one that you saved for your account.  \n\n&gt;**$caller:** *[the light finally starts to dawn]* Oh. Um... okay.  \n\n&gt;**$me:** Is there anything else I can help with?  \n\n&gt;**$caller:** No, that should take care of it.  \n\n&gt;**$me:** Sounds good, have a great morning!  \n\nTL;DR: User gets a bit too dependent on having her password saved, and accuses our system of messing with her account when she gets locked out for typing it in incorrectly. All this despite having gone through exactly the same thing only a month ago.\n\nEDIT: formatting",

        "text": "First of all, this is my first post here and I'm on mobile so sorry if I screw up formatting.\n\nTL;DR: the title\n\nI recently got a pretty good reaction out of a family member after \"fixing\" her laptop which reminded me of a similar story that happened about a year ago.\n\nI work in IT so naturally I'm \"the go to guy for computers\" among family and friends. The first story happened a few weeks ago when a family member comes up to me saying she can't install windows updates because her laptop is full and she did all she could to free up space. I said I'd be happy to take a look at it. The next day she comes to me and hands over the \"laptop\".... it's a 2 in 1 hybrid cheapo shitfest. Seriously why do people buy these things? So after taking a look it turns out to only have a 30GB hard drive which was literally completely full. \n\nAfter explaining to her that a €700 laptop will actually perform better and provide a nicer experience to a €300 one (which took 15 minutes of convincing) I started clearing files. After about 45 minutes of cleaning I cleared 7.5 GB of space, windows updates needed 8 of course. While I'm doing this btw she keeps complaining about how slow her laptop is. I eventually decide to just install the newest build of retail win 10. Lo and behold it works, she's got the newest version of windows 10GB of free space and a usable laptop.\n\nWhen I go to return it, she turns it on and fiddles around for a bit and says the following: \"wow! It's actually faster and has loads of free space!\". This is the sort of shit that really gets me. What did she expect? I would make it slower or outright brake it? It's so dumb, would she think I'd tell her I could fix it up and then proceed not to?\n\nThe second tale is simillar, my friend broke his laptop's HDD by throwing it down the stairs. I happened to have a 2.5\" drive with me so I opened up his laptop and replaced the drive. His reaction was simillar: \"wow! You opened up my laptop and it still works? You're a f***ing wizzard!\". Same thing goes here, what was he expecting?",

        "text": "Ok, I've been in the tech field for 20+ years and do sysadmin stuff now so I rarely interact with the end-users and I'm not on the help desk. I did help desk work for 10ish years so I know what that's like and I'm glad not to be there anymore. At my company, around 800 office users and 1,500+ people in the field (very little IT needs), we have an end user support team with a manager and an operations team with me as the manager. I am still very hands on, doing most of our linux and AWS work with a good deal of vmware and windows knowledge as well.  \n\n\nSometimes the help desk guys assign me tickets if they think it's something to do with the systems and not a typical problem, I'm fine with that and will fix it or kick it back to them if needed.  \n\n\nToday I got an email from one of our business analyst, a nice guy who just happens to be Indian as well. He did the needful and forwarded me and the helpdesk a long email chain with the latest thing in the chain being something about him not being able to connect to one of our managed systems. I clicked the link in the email and it didn't work for me either (I have to make sure it's not just his computer). I also checked our monitoring systems and made sure there was nothing obvious going on. I emailed him and the help desk back with my results and asked him to check with the vendors who manage the system. His response was that he tried what they said and it didn't work. After reading through this very long email chain I realize that the vendors said to test the system that you need to modify your hosts file - and they had said this to a different business analyst. How am I supposed to know that this is what he was referring to on a seemingly random forward. Anyways, I don't want to help him with modifying his hosts file, the help desk should be able to do that, so I reply all again, asking the help desk to help him out.  \n\n\nA little while later, one of our part time help desk guys (he's taking sys admin classes at the local college too) emails me that he can't modify the hosts file, he doesn't have permissions. I think about this for a minute (because I'm giving him the benefit of doubt) and realize that he does have permissions - all our users have permissions since they are all local admins (I know, but this is not my call). The help desk guy does not know that you have to run notepad 'as administrator' to modify the hosts file. I let him know this.  \n\n\nAgain, a few minutes later he emails me back and says if he does that he doesn't see any files to open. Harder eyeroll this time, good thing he can't see me! He also apparently doesn't know that you have to change the file type in the open file dialog box to 'all files'.   \n\n\nI know it's Monday but how many tropes can they throw at me within one email chain!",

        "text": "Hey TFTS. LTL, FTP, yadda whatever. you know the drill. So I consider myself just above average when it comes to tech support, and just recently I started a job where we support a company's users for a multitude of reasons. Most problems are easy. Add a computer to a domain, reset a password, install programs from the sharedrive, general Level 1 stuff. Well sometimes, we get those calls where I have no clue what to do, which comes in the KB Articles, which are usually helpful to learn how to do a specific task, as well as maybe learn a new skill from it. However, in comes the dreaded POORLY WRITTEN ARTICLE! It essentially turned what should have been a 5 minute call, if that, to a 40 minute call of trying plenty of other things that might end up resolving the issue. \n\nNow, to be fair, the article wasn't really \"poorly written,\" but more or less not very specific on the fact that there can be certain scenarios, and I take some of the blame for not realizing that, but I also talked with the person who edits/writes KB articles and said he would change it to be more specific. \n\nSo we have $User calling in, stating he cannot access a specific application. It was giving him an incorrect username and password error. Should be easy, I looked up the KB on it, and essentially the steps were the same as a normal active directory password reset, but instead of active directory, we used [insert application here]. Well, when I went to change the password, no luck. I verified the user wasn't locked out/disabled anywhere and that they were entering the password correctly. He was still unable to log in, and I decided to remote into the PC to get a clear view at what I was looking at. I figured maybe there was some sort of network problem keeping it from recognizing the password change. boy was I wrong. also please remember I am still learning so don't judge me too harshly for my next actions.\n\nSo this company has a WiFi network that, in order to connect to, you have to run a .BAT file from a folder located directly in the C:/ drive. I tried there first, since, they didn't have it, and if anything now they would. Still not working. They also tried connecting to the network with an ethernet cable, and it still kept giving this error. I verified one more time they weren't locked out anywhere before finally reaching out to our team chat and asking about the issue. \n\nthat's where I find out that this application that I have been trying to change the password for a user, uses the same password as the Active Directory password. I never sighed so loudly in my life. I looked back in the KB and sure enough it mentions it being a possibility, but not how to figure out whether the user had an AD or [application] password. granted, i should have checked further and made sure it was an Active Directory password, so in reality, it's mostly my fault. I have the user CTRL-ALT-DEL and change their password and wowie it works like a charm. \n\nMy first time in IT is fun. I realize I will mess up and make mistakes, but I have a very supporting team willing to help whenever possible, and I love that. I hope I can make this my career from here on out.\n\nTL;DR, I misinterpret a KB article, causes a call to go on for 40 minutes when it could have been as little as 5. \n\n",

Upon testing it out myself I found everything to be working properly and suggested it was perhaps just a momentary hiccup (aka, user error).  I instructed her to please try uploading her documents again and testing out the link that's generated to see if she can download them successfully.\n\nA little while later I received an update with a new screenshot saying \"This is what I'm getting when I sent myself the test\" and, sure enough, there's the same \"This site can't be reached\" error message... wait a minute- the EXACT SAME error message.  Pixel for pixel.  Only this time, it wasn't an actual error.  It was a screenshot... of a screenshot.\n\nAs her test, she had uploaded the previous screenshot of the error message she'd sent us, so when she clicked on the link to access her upload she saw \"This site can't be reached\" and thought it still wasn't working.  Rather than explain her mistake, we sent her a test that simply said \"It's Working!\" and called it a day.",

        "text": "[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/80tmay/i_guess_my_job_description_includes_everything/)\nI've been told that I'm not making any money for my time unless I sell TravelSite some work. They're also not following my recommendations and selling just the customer list and the domain. They'll have a few weeks to become an operating business or the sale falls through.   \n  \nI've been given access to their Google Drive so I can spelunk for any explanation of how it all works. As can be expected, lots of things are broken. My favorite has to be how they're claiming PCI compliance.  \n  \nThey have one PC with a dialup connection to process TravelSite's _advertisers_. You want your hotel or restaurant on their site, you can call, fax or email an encrypted zip file to TravelSite.  \n  \nIt's technically compliant with PCI, until you scratch the surface. TravelSite asks that all the customers sending encrypted zips use an easily guessed passphrase.   \n  \nWhere this all goes wrong is how tourists can book rooms. The only encryption is between the browser and TravelSite's servers. Card data is stored unencrypted and may be stored after the transaction is complete. In case you were wondering, this is bad.   \n  \nI call up a few friends and run this past them. For the cost of some Szechwan and many drinks, we have an idea to save TravelSite. One semi-employed friend (SEF) is willing to work as a temp IT lead executing a plan we came up with by the time the entrees came out. Credit cards can get processed in an iFrame going to Square, so TravelSite only gets a 'transaction OK' token back. SEF will pull some long hours patching everything and putting in the other controls necessary for PCI compliance. I'll write the paperwork at night. SEF &amp; I will split the take.  \n  \nNow we have a plan. I just have to sell it to TravelSite. I visit Mike and Spider again.   \n  \nme:\"I can get you out of this predicament for less than $35,000.\"  \n  \nMike (tapping my freshly printed contract):\"Well, now, that's a lot of money\"  \n  \nme:\"So is losing the TravelSite sale. \"  \n  \nSpider:\"Let's see your plan and we'll shop it around\"  \n  \nme:\"Er, no.\" \n  \nMike:\"You've got to give us something\"  \n  \nme:\"I sent you a link to your SAQ- that's the master document around your PCI compliance. Make that not a lie. That's the plan\"  \n  \nMike:\"Well, we'll think about it\"  \n  \nme:\"That's great. Let me know.\"  \n  \nMike called me before I got home. Seemed he had shopped the work and wanted to do business with me.   \n  \nMike:\"We want to go ahead with you, but we want a guarantee that it'll all work. We're also concerned about the price.\"   \n  \nme:\"Ok, what are your concerns?\"  \n  \nMike:\"We're willing to go as high as 10k if it all works out after the sale\"  \n  \nme:\"No, thanks\"    \n  \nMike:\"how about we pay per day- say $500?\"   \n  \nme:\"Thank you for your time. I wish you luck in your future endeavours\"  \n  \n \n  \n\n  \nA few days later, I get a voice mail from Mike. He's willing to accept my offer. He's not happy with my emailed response:  \n \nDear Mike,   \n  \nI have come to the conclusion that if you're going to be this difficult to work with before we've signed a contract, this isn't a project that will go smoothly enough to be worth it for my friend and I.  \n    \n  \nI didn't hear back from Mike, but I get odd LinkedIn messages from Spider from time to time. TravelSite now forwards to a domain place holder. \n \n",

Yesterday, this wonderful person came into my ear holes. \n\n\nME: hi thank you for calling ISP, my name's ME, how can I-\n\nCaller: you guys suck! I had issues with your modem, swapped it out, plugged everything in myself, and now none of the lights are even coming on. All of your equipment is garbage!\n\nME: sir, could do me a favor and just (shut up for two seconds) check to make sure the power cable is plugged in?\n\nCaller: of course it's plugged in! I plugged it in myself! Are you deaf?\n\nME: well sir, if it's not showing any lights, that indicates it not getting any power. Can you just double check for me?\n\n\nCaller walks to modem , cursing loudly enough for me to hear, \"under his breath\". Hear some rummaging and then \"well I'll be darned\"\n\n\nCaller: yeah, looks like it came undone somehow... I coulda sworn...\n\nME, smug AF: well, I'm seeing the modem on our end here so it looks like that was- *continuous ping starts timing out*... It... \n\nCaller: hey! All the lights are out again! What'd you do to my modem?\n\nTo keep this from getting too convoluted, since this is where it gets weird, turns out he had the power cable from his last modem still there behind his desk and had been the one he plugged into the wall that made the modem come on for a few seconds. Somehow. \n\n\nWe then proceeded to systematically plug and unplug both cables, from both ends, to get this modem to come on and stay on. Any action we took would power the modem for a few seconds and then it would die shortly afterwards, including having both cables plugged into the wall and plugging either of the modem sides into the modem...\n\n\nAfter a while I thought: (forget this black magic BS, throw the modem out the window!)\n\n\nAnd said: let's try this, can you remove one of the cables from behind the desk?\n\n\nHe did. Didn't plug or unplug anything on the other cable. Modem comes back online, finishes connecting, business as usual from there on. He asks for a credit, I shoot him down, he threatens to switch to our competition, I offer to transfer him to our disconnect line, and he says never mind and goes quietly. \n\n\nChecked on the modem earlier today at about the same time. ~24 hours uptime... Sure. Leaving this at black magic and calling it a day. \n\n\nTL;DR power cable unplugged. 2 cables back there. Both provide power for a few seconds then die. Removing one lets the other work normally. \n\n\nTL;DR too long: black magic happened. \n",

        "text": "PGP encryption works the same way as certificates, you have a private key and a public key .\n\nMy company works with vendors exchanging very sensitive information and so we have strict policies about encrypting and transmitting data . One of our vendors uses a third party to receive files, and that third party was thusly required to provide a public key and decrypt the files for our vendor . The third party then asked us what they wanted to do with the private key, don't ask me why. Unfortunately that email was directed to a business analyst and that started this whole shitshow.\n\nThis email resulted in three half hour long meetings over three days, with me explaining to the vendor, the third party and my own business team each time that the private key should not be shared, remotely backed up, or transmitted in any way and how it would completely invalidate our encryption policy. I explained how encryption worked, and where the keys should reside. They either didn't understand me, or didn't believe me, and the third party (business managers all) \"expressed concern\" that a loss of the key would result in (business related shudder) an interruption of service.\n\nWell duh.\n\nThis resulted in a panic from our business unit, despite my completely calm explanation that this would happen if our third party lost data anyways. They don't actually host our data, they are just an intermediate to transmit the data. Losing the key would amount to maybe an hour's work regenerating and replacing they keys in our respective automation softwares.\n\nStill unconvinced the business team organized another call including our information security team. I silently applauded the fact that at last there was someone else with at least a little technical know how that could back me up.\n\nThis last phone call was the most ridiculous meeting I've ever attended. After hearing the business and the third party express their concerns, the senior info sec tech's suggestions were consecutively that the third party could read the private key over the phone for us, or send it via letter mail, citing that as long as the key was transmitted along different means we could certainly store it.\n\nAre. You. Serious. I was flabbergasted. I was mortified. I muted myself on the conference call and started laughing manically to the point of crying out of utter disbelief.\n\nSome how I talked them out of it, but only with the reasoning that if the key was lost it would take us longer to ship it back to them, or 'read' it to them than it would to generate a new one. This didn't sit well with the business team, with the potential nightmare of an interruption to process going through their heads without the concern of what that actually meant.",

        "text": "Hello TFTS.  This happened about 3 and a half years ago while I was still an intern and was probably the single worst … best … most interesting day I ever had working with my employer at the time.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe players in this story are Me – Self explanatory, Boss – My manager at the time, VP – The VP of sales for the company\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe day started with me laying in my bed awoken by the loud repeated chirping of my cell phone ringer.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;Me: This is $Me\n\n&gt;Boss: Hi $Me, I just wanted to check in and make sure that you were ok because we haven’t seen you at the office yet this morning\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI rolled over and looked at my clock, it’s flashing 9:05 … I’m over an hour late for work and I live a half hour away.\n&amp;nbsp;\n&gt;Me: Aww crap, I overslept.  I’ll be there in about an hour\n\n&gt;Boss: Alright, get here when you can.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI hang up the phone take a quick shower and get dressed.  I grab a muffin on my way out the door and I get to work at about 10.\nBefore I have even made it to my desk I get stopped by $VP.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;VP: Hey, $Me.  My tablet isn’t connecting to my keyboard or my dock.  Can you take a look at that for me?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI nod my head\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;Me: Bring the tablet, dock, and keyboard over to my desk and I’ll take a look.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA few minutes later $VP arrives with the requested items and at a quick glance I see what his problem likely is, the tablet and dock are filthy.  Ports are full of gunk and the tablet screen is so smudged that you can barely see anything on it.  I let VP know that I will take a look and let him know when I am finished, probably about 45 minutes to an hour.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI take the next half hour to carefully clean the gunk out of all of the ports using a plastic pick tool that I had handy and compressed air from a little compressor that I had at the work bench.  Having gotten as much out as it seemed possible I tried to connect the keyboard and it of course worked.  After that I thought it would be a good idea to confirm that the dock worked as well but I had no doubts that it would.  I hooked up the dock and that was when the day got worse.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA 4 inch jet of flame came shooting out of the joint where the dock and the tablet connected, the tablet flickered off and the dock started to melt.  I quickly grabbed the power cord for the dock and yanked it from the wall with an explicative shout\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHearing me swear, Boss comes running over to see what is going on.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;Boss: $Me, what’s going on, are you alright?\n\n&gt;Me: I’m fine $Boss.  I was cleaning up $VP’s tablet and when I put it back on the dock it started on fire\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n$Boss looks at the charred and slightly melted dock with a silent look of awe.  I wander over to $VP’s office to let him know what happened.  Surprisingly he just laughs and says that he will take a replacement when we can get one but not to worry about rushing it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHaving informed $VP of the fate of his tablet I then get on the phone with the vendor to try making a warranty claim – After sending a number of pictures of the tablet and dock they accept it but it takes me 3 hours of being on the phone with them, mostly to fill out what seemed to be insurance paperwork.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter hanging up the phone $Boss walks over and says we need to have a chat and heads off to the server room; we usually had short private conversations in there because it was easier than trying to get one of the conference rooms for a 10 minute talk.  I figured that this was where I was going to get let go or at the very least raked over the coals for the way that the day had gone so far.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;Boss: $Me, you know that we really like having you working here and you have been a great help.\n&gt;Me: Thanks $Boss, it’s been a pleasure working here so far. (Internally I’m just thinking that I’m about to be let go)\n&gt;Boss: I know that today has not been a typical day for you and has gone a bit off the rails …\n&gt;Me: I know and I’m sor-\nBoss cuts me off before I can say any more\n&gt;Boss: But we aren’t here to talk about that\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI’m slightly confused at this point, unsure of what is going on.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;Boss: We talked previously about you wanting more hours and we would like to give them to you as well as a raise because you have been doing excellent work\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n$Boss and I talked for another 15 minutes while I was told what was given the offer and accepted.  All told I ended up getting the hours I wanted and a 50% raise.  Despite the way the day started, I have to say that it ended on a high note.",

        "text": "Update to [this post about a very demanding coworker]( https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7ybj38/one_of_the_few_times_i_actually_said_no/).It was an eventful week for sure!    \n  \n\n\nBackground:\nI am an IT Mangler for a life science company. I have offices and users all over the globe. It's the local ones though that keep me there - most are like family to me.\n\nRemember when you were in school and you had some kids that were \"teacher's pet\" AKA \"brown-nosers\"? I work with one of those and they report directly to the same guy I have a \"dotted line\" to at my site (I report directly to the CIO ) who I will just call \"Boss\". This person is well known for constantly demanding things from office supplies to lab equipment and of course IT stuff. None of us in the service areas really like to work with them because of the added strain of dealing with a whiny tattletale. Sorry if that sounds harsh, but this person is borderline abusive to my dept and several others.  \nThe players:    \n\n$Me: Me, the heroine of the tale, of course :) \n\n$SLM: Shitty Lab Manager (AKA \"Special\" Lab Manager)    \n  $Boss: Plant Manager, $SLM's boss, my local \"dotted line boss\" (explained in other post)    \n   \n$Maria: In other of my TFTS's - $Boss's boss \n      \n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nSo $SLM had a pretty busy week! Top Events/Moments included but are not limited to:    \n\n\n\n* Closed power supply in their laptop destroying half the screen &amp; replacement screen is either bad or they destroyed the laptop (to shreds, literally!)   \n  \n* I didn't even now it but they went out and bought a brand new car last week. Status, you know.  \n   \n* *Demanded* $Maria's old office which is the lactation room now (have to have one by law), didn't get it.  \n   \n* Told several people who are not managers to move out of THEIR offices because they are \"a manager and I shouldn't have to share an office!!\" (many managers share offices as we are low on office space, this person *WAS ALREADY SHARING WITH ANOTHER LAB MANAGER WHO IS ACTUALLY ABOVE THEM IN RANK!*). This did *not* go over well. Nobody moved.  \n\n\n* Tried to blame the heads of Maintenance AND Customer Service because they made severe enough mistakes on the documentation of a product they made AS WELL as not following THE SOP to make it. This caused a shipment of the product to move into the next \nquarter because of the time to correct it and figure out exactly what happened - this is really, REALLY not good. But not their fault, nope.  \n\n* *TOLD* the Director of Maintenance HE needed to calculate GForce on the rotors of THEIR centrifuges because they in a meeting all 3 of us were in (where they SAID they didn't understand Gforce OR know how to calculate it - *LMGTFYdotCOM,right?)!!* $SLM was told ALL of their centrifuge SOP's that use RPMs instead of GForce HAVE to be changed *immediately* to reflect the correct GForce, not RPM's. They were even offered a calculation from a Director of the other labs in that meeting but they never took them up on it. Boggles my mind.  \n  \n* Purchased enough furniture for their \"home office\" that it exceeded the Director of Purchasing's  company credit card (not an exaggeration!) (DoP works for $Boss, too)   Can I just say that my company does NOT pay for remote office furniture or equipment beyond a laptop unless you are a REMOTE 100% User. $SLM was taking half days and \"working from home\" &amp; $Boss LET THEM! That is against our division's policies, he was not aware - I told him to call his boss and as if it changed (it has not). Soooooooooo, no worky from home &amp; getting paid for it! I can't, YOU shouldn't be able to.\n  \nTuesday we had an outdoor event at work and I was the sound person so I was outside setting up when I saw $SLM going to their *new car* and I could tell they were upset but honestly I didn't think much of it.       \nWell, Wednesday AM the $DoM came to see me and told me $SLM had been sent home the day before because of their behavior (and later I found out because of the $$ on the home office) and would not be back until the next day. He said $Boss, $HR, and $SLM were all in $Boss's office Tuesday AM &amp; he could hear shouting and crying from the hallway. Right after was when I saw them leave. Wow, $SLM got a free day &amp; a half off. That's it.    \n   \nAre you, too, asking HOW DO THEY STILL HAVE A JOB??? I don't know. I really don't but here was MY experience with them this week:\n\nThursday in the meeting, they *demanded* a phone in a lab in front of $Boss). I said they would have it by the end of the day. I went back to my office and set up the phone as ~~requested~~demanded &amp; $SLM was in my building 2 doors down from me so as they were leaving I called out, and handed them the phone with a cable and showed them how to plug it in.     \n&gt;$SLM: \"Oh, cool - got it no problem,thanks!\"       is what they said to ME. Well, $SLM ran to $Boss bc I told them to plug it in themselves and they didn'tnow how to do it, so $Boss calls me and asks me:   \n \n&gt;$Boss: Is it really that hard for you to plug in a phone? $SLM just told me what happened and I know you two don't get along, $HR told me what you said!     \n\n(So..... $HR told $Boss I said I was going to file a formal complaint against $SLM if they kept trying to bully me into helping them even though I ASKED $HR not to say anything to $Boss. My bad for trusting HR.)   \n&gt;$Me: Is it really that hard for $SLM to do it? I most definitely SHOWED them how!    \n  \n&gt;$Boss: Look, we are working with $SLM on their professionalism and communication, we know it's not easy (etc,etc), can you just *please* go plug the phone in?   \n&gt;$Me: Sure. I will be happy to take the high road.   \n&gt;$Boss: YES that's what I meant, I expect more out of you being the senior manager.    \n   \nUgh,step on my soft spot. FINE. I WILL TAKE THE HIGH ROAD!   \nI went and plugged the phone in and let $Boss and $SLM know. Then I went home. And thought about it.    \nI can take the *highest* road...   \n \n\n$SLM sent an email to everyone EXCEPT $Boss that they had \"limited access to email so they will be behind in responding because their laptop broke.\" (grrrrrrrr) I found $SLM and offered the use of my own spare work laptop (I have tons of tools on it)&amp; was turned down ($SLM's still waiting for theirs to be fixed) because I knew they were having to find random PC's in labs to use - later that day I even offered a nice tablet, was also turned down. All in writing. But lastly, I told $SLM to their face I wanted no issues between us and all they had to do was be nicer &amp; ASK not make demands.   \nI then sent an email to $Boss that said $SLM has alienated the entire management team, including me but I was willing as a Senior Manager to help them, maybe even *mentor* them. I laid it on thick, mainly because I KNOW $SLM will *NEVER* allow me to help them. I closed my email to $Boss with this:    \n&gt;Regardless of whether or not my offer of assistance is taken up on I don't believe there will be any further issues between us.   \n  \nThere won't be. The rest of the managers are all banded together. Now we can have some popcorn, sit back &amp; watch!\n   \nTL/DR: Shitty Lab Manager does more shitty things but gets a bite of karma which will hopefully result in a happier work Environment while making me look better by taking the high road.\n    \nEdits: None yet but there will be I'm sure!",

        "text": "So for the last few months I worked for a regional tax service with 45 offices and I was at there main building where they had been storing there obsolete equipment basically since the turn of the century. \n\nAnywho, we round everything up and there are 50+ 17\" CRT monitors as old as 1994, probably 100 capacitor plague ridden Optiplex GX and SX series PCs, another 100 various Athlon64 based machines (all of these are the wonderful USFF models with the CPU fans integrated into the hard drive bay), another 50 Intel versions of the USFF 700 series machine, around 50 assorted computers from the late 90s (Pentium IIIs, not cheapos either, several were high end Vectra work stations), around 4 pallets of early 2000's beige fax machines and printers, a pallet of (failed, we tested a few) UPS's, and 4 totes full of obsolete PS2 keyboards, and several totes full of things so obsolete I had to google what they were. \n\nIt was my duty to find a place that would take these (CRTs included) at no cost. I come to find out later while breaking into the computer of one of my predecessors that I wasn't the first person to get this job as there were pictures of when these machines were first put on pallets dated 2011 and pictures of several machines turned on. It was also my job to strip the RAM out of them. I kid you not most of the GX50s and GX60s (pentium III based Celerons) had been upgraded to 2GB using 2GB SDRAM modules. I didn't even know they made SDRAM into that capacity. I also had to pull the hard drives. I eventually found a manifest that explained these modifications: They had been using these machines (along with Windows XP and 2000) up until 2014.\n\nYes, thats right. Pentium III Celerons were in use with this company for over 15 years straight. This along with the fact i was supposed to somehow make CRTs vanish into thin air without paying a recycling fee (around here most places charge 5 dollars a monitor) were my first indications that we basically had no IT budget. What's worse is that all this garbage was stored on the second floor which meant we had to move it all down to the loading bay (where my boss also had constructed a partial home, and stored vintage cars..... we weren't well managed). Some of these machines were so full of dust and ruptured capacitors I nearly got sick working on them.\n\nOh yes, and I was expected to do all this for $10 an hour, and have it done by March (we started mid January), somehow without incuring overtime. This was in addition to doing constant live remote tech support for 45 locations and readying machines to be deployed and applying mandatory updates after hours (which had to be done manually for the main PC at each office, after hours because it knocks everything offline).\n\nIt was almost like they had never thought that eventually this stuff would pile up and by that time they would be so obsolete you can't GIVE them away (this is in IL, we have some of the strictest eWaste disposal laws in America. So anything like CRTs and printers can cost 5-50 per unit to dispose of). I told them that there timeline was unreasonable and in order to get rid of this stuff at no cost to the company it would take me months and that getting rid of it right away we were looking at 2 grand (which is a tiny expense given the size of the company) and the boss looked at me like I was insane.\n\nLast I heard they found a place in a major urban center that would take them for free because of the AMD and intel machines being new enough to be resold. We only had two people working IT (for 150 employees) and my position was eliminated because apparently 2 people would be an unneccesary expense. They kept the guy with 20+ years on me and a degree. That didn't even make sense because while he had more OS and Networking skills I could run circles around him with anything hardware related such as oh I don't know, preparing machines for disposal (in two days I stripped something like 100 computers, in two days the other guy stripped 30 or so).\n\nSorry for the horrible writing, I'm not a great story teller, but that's the story of the worlds worst managed IT department and the worlds worst IT graveyard.",

        "text": "Configuring a new wireless AP today when everything that could go wrong, did. The new AP was one of those higher end consumer routers, a triple band Nighthawk model. I told the client it would take 20 minutes and essentially just had to plug it in.\n\nI planned to daisy chain it to the existing Surfboard cable modem which had a much weaker AP signal strength. So without thinking about it too much, I logged on to configure the Nighthawk wirelessly through it's factory default network, because I was short a patch cable.\n\nAfter putting it in AP mode and setting the SSID identical to the Surfboard AP, I wanted to log in to the Surfboard and disable the radio. Unfortunately in this frustrating interface, I clicked a slide bar which visibly implied the radio was OFF, but like an idiot, I did not notice it was still ON because I did missed a save button which I did not see. This single mistake led to a joyful hour of fun. I just figured it was just the Surfboard's firmware messing with me, so I put the Surfboard in bridge mode. Unfortunately for me, I forgot I also had put the Nighthawk in AP mode (non routing) and was genuinely horrified when I checked IPconfig to find that the machine's IP address was now a 76.*** public address. The shock...  (On the positive note: ran a speedtest and it pulled 250 mb/s through wifi)\n\nAt this point I realized things were going quite poorly and opted to change the Nighthawk's SSID to isolate my problems.  Unfortunately with both AP in bridge mode (and my networking skills quite rusty) I did not realize at the time that DCHP was thus disabled and it would no longer assign an IP via wireless or patch. Spent about 10 minutes smashing face into keyboard and power cycling to get IP assignment before going for a hard reset on the Nighthawk.  This is my favorite part.\n\nDo you want to reset this router? Oh, sorry this is a new fancy pants router and must be reset in a very specific way. No, you cannot reset it like any other router in the last 20 years. After messing around with the thing for what must have been 30 minutes, I figure out, it can only be hard reset properly after it has FULLY powered on and initialized (2 minutes) and only then, will it correctly reset to factory settings. Otherwise pressing hard reset just restarts it and it didn't really wipe to factory.\n\nThankfully after resetting the Nighthawk and going through it again, I notice the save button I missed earlier, disable the modem's radio and confirm the network was working properly. \n\nSo what did I learn? Maybe don't change an AP's SSID to duplicate another until you are 100% sure it is going to work right. Common sense!!! ",

        "text": "I just started a new job 3 weeks ago at a K-12 Institution and so far it has been quite enjoyable! It’s my first time using Google for administration and my first time using administration tools in general.  \n\n\nFor a couple weeks, this middle schooler had been coming to my office asking about his Chromebook. Apparently, he lost it and has been using other teacher’s Chromebooks for his studies. Every time he came though I wasn’t able to help him since no Chromebooks were turned in. I figured he left it at home or lost it in a classroom somewhere. I wasn’t sure what else to do for him.  \n\n\nThen my wife, who also works in tech for K-12, sent me a link to Google’s Device Activity page. This let me see what the kid had logged into and when. I was able to find out that he had used his account to log into his machine 2 weeks ago. I then thought I might be able to try searching his name on the Google Admin side to find out what machines had recognized his credentials. Sure enough, a few Chromebooks pop up. The first 2 were computers he had borrowed from teachers, but the next one had to be his Chromebook. It was showing that the last time it was logged into was indeed 2 weeks ago. Honestly, I was hoping to only help the kid get a better idea of when he last lost it. I’ve never tracked down a lost computer before and wasn’t really sure what else to do. But then I noticed that there was a second set of credentials that had logged in that same day 2 weeks ago. Some other kid had logged onto his machine!  \n\n\nI speak with the librarian that was with me at the time and she informs me of the kid’s identity and I suggest we call the kid down for a quick question. A high school girl shows up and I say to her, “You aren’t in trouble or anything, but we are looking for a missing Chromebook.”  \n\n\nI don’t even get to finish asking the question and she blurts out, “My grandfather took it out of lost-and-found. It’s in his dresser drawer at home.”  \n\n\nThe librarian’s jaw hits the floor.  \n\n\nI calmly ask, “Can you ask your grandfather to bring that back please?”  \n\n\nThe kid says, “Sure” and walks away.  \n\n\nApparently, the middle schooler’s friends put the Chromebook in the school’s lost-and-found which is just a table in a hallway. The high schooler’s grandfather swiped school property (which is tagged BTW) and took it home. The high schooler knew it was school property and didn’t say anything for 2 weeks. We got the computer back, but only because the high schooler had logged in. If that hadn’t happened I don’t know what else I could have done to find it.  \n\n\nThe job has been challenging and rewarding. I’m looking forward to what comes next, but I think there are going to be some opportunities for more stories like these.\n",

Happened a couple of months ago.\n\nWe provide on site tech support for home and corporate users (75% home users). They call us after watching our ads on late night tv. \n\nGot ticket where a user was not getting display. Ticket also mentions that she thinks it is the GPU drivers causing the issue.\n\nI get to users and the house is filled with moving boxes. Only the computer table and the PC have been put in place. It is very messy, navigating is impossible with the bed frame, sofas and boxes blocking entrances to doors.\n\n&gt;User: Really sorry about the mess. I have moved here today and the movers have just dropped all my stuff. I really need to get my computer working as I need to play my game.\n\n&gt;Me: No worries. Lets have a look at the problem.\n\nI turn the PC on and sure enough no display. I didn't even see the POST screen so I have a look if the monitor is plugged in. The monitor is into the mobo instead of the GPU. Connect it to the GPU and got display but the was getting the no boot devices found. I open the case and seems the SSD had dislodged from the tool free enclosure and a sata cable had come loose. Install SSD back and connect the SSD. Restart PC and everything seems to be running ok. I note that the GPU is a branded 1080ti, wonder what she plays.\n\n&gt;Me: Seems that is what the problem was. HDMI connected to the wrong port and the SSD being disconnected.\n\n&gt;User: That simple. I know nothing about computers. My husband built this custom PC himself.\n\nI am thinking if the husband is capable if building a high end custom PC then why is she calling us?\n\n&gt;Me: How come your husband didn't connect everything properly.\n\n&gt;User: He's an a#@hole. He is divorcing me. But I took all his stuff (after a 5 second gap) and the house, which I am trying to sell. It is on the market now. This is why I moved here.\n\nLooking at the screen. See steam installed and shortcuts to all AAA titles on the desktop. Try changing topics.\n\n&gt;Me: Lots of games here. Which one's do you mainly play.\n\n&gt;User: None of these, my husband used to play them. I play Empire: Four Kingdoms (I wouldn't have remembered it if she hadn't repeated it 100 times in the hour I was there). I am the guild leader there, everybody relies on me to get stuff done. I really have to be online asap.\n\nThinking this is an mmorpg. \n\n&gt;Me: Awesome, I used to play a lot of WoW. Fun times\n\n&gt;User: You gotta join us. It is an amazing game.\n\nI have been at her place for maybe 10 mins now. Since we charge in 1 hour blocks we 'HAVE' to ask if there is something else we can help with if we solve the problem before the 1 hour is up. When they call to book a service the script tells them \"After the tech solves your issue he can have a look at your PC and answer and tech questions you may have\". We cant leave even when the problem is solved if the user has questions.\n\n&gt;Me: I would have loved to if I had the time, unfortunately I don't get time anymore. If there is anything else you need help with please let me know otherwise I have to get going.\n\n&gt;User: Since I am paying for the full hour I have to think if I need help with something. Lemme show you my game.\n\nShe launches a browser game (I think, dont remember if it had a launcher or not).\n\n&gt;Me: Don't you have to pay to win these games?\n\n&gt;User: Nah the game is completely. We do have to buy the gems. I only buy them because I am the guild leader. Everybody else in the guild is like 14 years old and they don't have any money. In order for the guild to be competitive I give my members gems.\n\n&gt;Me: Oh, how much do you spend typically?\n\n&gt;User: Not a lot. But you cant put a price on this. I get so much enjoyment out of this. I'll give you gems if you join my guild.\n\n&gt;Me: I wish I had the time. But really how much do you spend every month?\n\n&gt;User: (ignores question). Here is my village. This is blah blah blah\n\n&gt;Me: How much do you play everyday.\n\n&gt;User: Some times I don't even sleep for days. As a guild leader I have to manage everything.\n\nI need to know more. I am confused. It looks like the typical waiting game, you click something and it takes x amount of hours to complete. \n\n&gt;Me: How come? What do you do when you are playing it?\n\n&gt;User: Mainly diplomacy and recruiting. I have to message other guild members to form alliances. Planning attacks and stuff. But most of the time is spent on convincing new players to join my guild. When a new player joins the game their village is put somewhere randomly on the map. The first relocation is free. I have to convince new players to join my guild and relocate near my village. So that every guild member is close. \n\n&gt;Me: Interesting\n\n&gt;User: You see. I joined the game late and I am a very competitive person. I need to have the strongest/biggest guild in the game. At the moment I am messaging every new player that joins the game. \n\n&gt;Me: So thats why it takes so much of your time?\n\n&gt;User: Exactly. If you join I will make you a co-leader. I love my guild members. I also organize meetups with other members. It is an awesome community. Sometimes I fly to other cities to meet other members.\n\n&gt;Me: Like cities where multiple of your members are?\n\n&gt;User: No, single users. That is how much I love my members. I fly out to meet every single one if they are open to meeting me.\n\n&gt;Me: Amazing\n\n&gt;User: Well if you even want to join these are my details (jots down stuff on a paper and hands it to me). I guess we are done. Thank you for helping me, there is nothing I need help with. I need to play my game now. Have a good day.\n\n&gt;Me: Good day to you too.\n\n",

There is a man (we'll call him **Joe**) whom I have known for quite a while who asks me to come over to his house from time to time to help him with computer issues.  These issues are generally pretty simple (plugging in the printer to fix it, clicking the \"U\" button to underline text in Microsoft Word, etc.).  Even though I prefer to not spend my time on these things (I'm not getting paid for these jobs), I do enjoy being able to help him.  He does try to do his best, and I absolutely respect that.  \n\nLast week, he called me over because his brother (we'll call him **Bill**) couldn't get connected to Joe's network.  I honestly wasn't quite sure what was going on, but I took the job under the assumption it was something that I could solve.  \n\nI arrived and Bill explained the issue:  \n&gt; **Bill:** \"So I've been staying over here recently because I'm between apartments, and I can't get my computer to connect to the house.  It doesn't even let me put in the address.\"  \n&gt; **Me:** \"Interesting, may I take a look at it?\"  \n&gt; **Bill:** \"Sure, here you go\" *hands me the laptop* \"Just so you know, it's really really slow at times, but I'm used to Windows 3 lol, so I don't mind\"\n\nI look at it and the ~~first~~ second thing I noticed was that the laptop was in airplane mode.  Turned off airplane mode, connected to the network, entered the password, and we're off and rolling.  Bill was quite grateful that the issue was resolved so quickly.\n\nNow for the fun part of this story.  The first thing that met my eyes when I opened that computer up was a Windows 10 system with a Windows 8 UI, a Windows Vista start menu, Windows 7 desktop gadgets, and a MacOS dock.  Being the young, inexperienced individual that I am, I must admit that I was quite frightened by the sight.  Of course I knew how they got there (sketchy third-party applications), but that was still the most horrifying computer I have ever laid my hands on.  With his permission, I uninstalled the Windows 8 UI, MacOS dock, and the desktop gadgets (which brought the CPU usage down to about 99% instead of 100%), but I couldn't easily figure out which application was running the Vista menu.\n\nIt's certainly not the most exciting (or horrifying) story I've ever had, but I think it is certainly the most interesting.\n\nI'm honestly kind of looking forward to the inevitable return visit-- I really want to get the rest of the computer cleaned up and in a somewhat workable condition.",

Senior tech specialist.  \nStarlet - The user. Has the name of a movie star.   \nSir Chips - Burt Reynolds' boss. Talkative but nice. \n\nStarlet has been a minor problem for a bit. Nothing serious; just repeated, ongoing, drop-by verbal \"ticketing\" and the like. Mostly friendly but high maintenance. We've been encouraging her to send tickets the way she's supposed to, but it hasn't been working.\n\nIts early afternoon and I'm plugging away at something when I hear Starlet tell Joe, in the cube next to me, that she's having problems with email: she cannot forward messages with attachments.\n\nA few weeks before an MS patch caused these same symptoms, and Starlet had other issues around the same time necessitating our replacing her computer, which fixed all her problems at the time.\n\nI interrupt Starlet asking if she's sent a ticket for this (I know she hasn't, I have just refreshed the Queue in front of me). She grumbles \"I'm just frustrated about this issue that's been going on all morning\" but ambles back to her desk just down the hall and sends a ticket.\n\nYay!\n\nBut it's a high severity ticket.\n\nLess yay.\n\nAnd I know that before talking with Joe she had been galavanting around the office shooting the breeze with buddies and pals for at least half an hour.\n\nNo yay remaining.\n\nJoe is capable of fixing this, but I want this handled cleanly, precisely, and with zero room left for Starlet to wiggle in, so I assign the ticket to myself and send her a series of emails with attachments of various types asking her to reply to them.\n\nShe replies by creating a new message saying the problem is not occurring with the test messages.\n\nI reply telling her I need to be very precise about this to both confirm the issue and get as clear a picture of the details as possible, and so I need her to reply with the attachments.\n\nShe gives another detail: It's only with documents that have been scanned.\n\nEasy enough: two more messages go to her from scanned documents.\n\nStarlet prevaricates some more, but includes a screenshot of the offending email: the email in the screenshot has a Word document attached (so it sure as heck wasn't scanned) and she's in the \"Attachment\" tab, which has never had the Forward or Reply buttons (those are only in the Message tab).\n\nBut Starlet is no longer at her desk. \n\nA few hours later she is done dancing about the office again and I meet her at her desk just as Sir Chips drops by. \n\nI have her open the offending email while Sir Chips watches and we confirm the correct buttons are right there in the ribbon, and then I have her click on the attachment and we observe the ribbon switches to the Attachment table  and the buttons are no longer visible. Finally we confirm we can return to the Messages tab and find the missing buttons right where they always were. \n\nSir Chips and I share a friendly shrug and I close the ticket. \n\n",

        "text": "*It's been awhile, hasn't it?  I'd like to blame life, but really it's just a combination of writer's block and getting sucked into Subnautica.  Here's the first of a fun little trio of vignettes.*\n\n\n*By the way, highly recommend that game.*\n\n\nEarly in my career, I discovered I had to improve my listening skills.  Not to people, of course, but to the engines themselves.  You see, every engine has its own ‘voice’ which, if you listen, can let you know when something is wrong.  A stutter in your car can point towards a dead or failing distributor.  A knocking could indicate a rod is about to be forcefully ejected through the engine case.  An unholy banshee screaming to drag your soul to hell could be a sign of a bent turbine blade.  Of course, sometimes, what you *don’t* hear can be just as indicative of a problem…\n\nHere’s  one of three quick tales to illustrate that very skill in action.\n\n***\n\n*Mannheim, Germany, 2006*\n\nIt was a bright and cheerful Monday morning.  I exited the back door of our shop to the ramp, walked past our Avionics Shop containers situated beside the hangar and watched as Charlie Company attempted to start one of their helicopters, a UH-60A Blackhawk.  I listened to the starting whine of the APU and cocked my head sideways.\n\nMy Turbine Senses started tingling.  Something was wrong—confirmed as the little turbine wound back down and several crew began to cluster near the tail exhaust.  \n\nI walked up to the gathered crew as the APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) start sequence was reinitiated.  Something was off alright, the hum of the start was off, and the telltale *tic tic tic* of the exciter firing was far too weak and muffled. Suddenly, a fireball shot from the exhaust as the pooled fuel in the exhaust pipe ignited, causing a torching start and an automatic shutdown to protect the engine.  \n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Looks like you guys have a problem.”\n\n&gt;**Crewchief1**  “Yeah, it’s not starting.  Probably needs another new ignitor.” \n\nI raised my eyebrows.  *Another* new ignitor?  The ignitors are a type glow plug which will create quite a satisfying “snap” as it discharges the electricity delivered by the capacitors in the exciter, but generally a new ignitor shouldn’t sound so muffled, nor should it need to be replaced so quickly.  Putting those pieces together and adding the odd sound of the engine along with the torching start, I knew what the issue was.\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “Don’t waste your time with the ignitor.  You’re gonna need a new fuel control.”\n\nCrewchief1 looked slightly confused, but he was rescued from my contradiction by his Sergeant, who was a part of the gathering.  \n\n&gt;**Sergeant** “What?  No, that takes too long.  The problem is the ignitor.  Besides, don’t you have some oil to inventory or tools to issue?”\n\nWell then. I know where I’m not wanted! \n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Roger that, Sergeant, I’ll just head on back to the hangar.  Let me know when you guys want me to replace the fuel control.”\n\n***\nI kept an eye on the situation for the rest of the week, but while they kept changing parts they never came to me.  Finally, on Friday, a friend of mine in Charlie Company, Crewchief2, came by my toolroom to visit.\n\n&gt;**Crewchief2** “Hey, ZeeWulf, got a minute?”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “What can I do for you?”\n\n&gt;**Crewchief2** “Sergeant is out to lunch…and I need a hand putting a fuel control together.”\n",

Did he bring the forms on a flash drive or did he E-Mail them?\"  \n&gt;$U: \"He has them on a flash drive.\"  \n\n\nAt this point, I get remoted into her computer and check to make sure the network printer is online etc. thinking something in the process was not working. The user lets me troubleshoot for 10-15 mins before telling me what the real issue was. \n\n\n&gt;$ME: \"What was the issue with printing his forms?\"  \n&gt;$U: \"Oh, printing wasn't the issue, I just didn't want to be charged for it and the printer won't accept his card.\"  \n&gt;$ME: \"What do you mean it won't accept his card, I thought you said he wasn't an employee?\"  \n&gt;$U: \"That's right, he isn't an employee.\"  \n&gt;$ME: \"So what card is he using?\"  \n&gt;$U: \"Um... hold on... I think its a MasterCard.\"  \n\n\nJust then, as if a truck drove through my primary monitor, it hit me. She was swiping his debit card at the card swipe on the printer. I put the user on mute and laughed for a solid 5 minutes with my colleagues before composing myself and calmly explaining the difference between that card swipe and the POS card swipe at the store. She was very nice about the whole thing and she ended up just eating the 6 cents that it cost for her to print his forms. \n\n\nTL;DR: User swiped a debit card at the card swipe authenticator on a printer to avoid being charged for the print job.

I was not customer service, but I was covering the phones while our receptionist/office manager was taking lunch.  An older gentleman calls in.\n\nOG: Ya, I've been using my computer a lot lately to talk to my grand kids in college, but I was not able to last night.  I think i need to refill my Yahoo.\n\nMe: \"I beg your pardon, refill your Yahoo?\"\n\nOG: Yeah, i wasn't able to get to the page last night to mail the kids. I could hear the phone thing (dial up modem) trying to send my mail, but nothing happened, so i guess i ran out of Yahoo, and need to buy more.\n\nMe: (Knowing there was an issue last night with the dial in modem bank being down) Sir, there was an unplanned outage last night, and our customers were unable to connect to the Internet for a couple of hours. We apologise for the inconvenience, but you should be good to go now.\n\nOG: No, no.. you are not listening to me.  My Yahoo doesn't work anymore, and i need more. My credit card number is XXX-XXX....\n\nMe: Sir, i don't need your card info. The dial in bank should be ready for you now.  Please hang up, and try dialing again and see if you can connect.\n\nOG: (hearing only part of what i said) Oh, it's all ready for me! Thank you SO much! i just love this email thing with my grandkids! i talk to them more now than ever!  And don't worry, i won't tell anyone you refilled my Yahoo without charging me. (shouting to someone off phone) Sweetheart, we are all full up on Yahoo again! We can send more mail to the kids!  (Back to me) Thank you again for all your help! Next time i am just going to call you to have our Yahoo refilled!\n\nMe: Uh, glad to be of service, Sir.  have a great day\n\nOG: You too! The Yahoo Wizard! (Hangs up)\n\nMe: I need to add \"Yahoo Wizard\" to my CV..\n\nEdit: Because my spelling sucks..",

So the following tale got me wondering if end users think we are all powerful. \n\n\nThe players: \n\nU$ER - A man who doesn't understand the capabilities of the help desk. \n\n\nME - Person who totally didn't tell his co-workers about this call immediately after it happened. \n\n_______________________________________\n\n\nME: Thank you for calling ****. This is u/PrizefighterProducts. How may I help you today?\n\n\nU$ER: My computer isn't working. \n\n\nME: I'm sorry to hear that. What's going on with that computer? \n\n\nU$ER: Well the power has been flickering on and off for the last two hours because we are having a bad storm right now and I can't get the computer to stay on. \n\n\nME: ... \n\n\nU$ER: My router has a red light when the power comes back on. Can you fix it? \n\n\nME: Sir, I'm sorry that is happening. I'm willing to bet that the router has a red light because it hasn't had a chance to reacquire the network before the power goes off again. Have you thought about contacting the electric company to see if they're working on fixing that issue? \n\n\nU$ER: The hotel we're connected to is having the same issue with their system. I'll ask them to call the power company. \n\n\nME: Yeah. Unfortunately there isn't anything we can do for that issue as it isn't faulty equipment or an issue with the network. It sounds like you'll just have to wait for this storm to pass. Thank you for calling. \n\n\n___________________________________\n\n",

        "text": "This little story happened this week, it involved myself and a relatively new user who is still in her teens, that bit is relevant as I maybe foolishly, thought someone younger would understand the differences between hardware that makes up a workstation.\n\nU - the user. D - Me!\n\n&gt;U: Hey D, so there is a computer in the room near me that no one uses, can it be moved to another room so I can use it for some other tasks.\n\n&gt;D: Sure, no problem, I'll pop down to the room and move things around.\n\nI walk down to the room, smallish room with a desk, on said desk was a monitor, keyboard and mouse with the cables dangling down. I look under the desk, no computer tower, so I get a bit confused and go chat with the user.\n\n&gt;D: So I've been in that room, there is only a monitor, keyboard and mouse, not computer tower, I can get one sorted but I'll need to get it from the other office.\n\n&gt;U: No no, there is definitely a computer in there.\n\n&gt;D: When did you last check? People have a habit of moving things without telling me (true story)\n\n&gt;U: About 30 minutes ago?\n\n&gt;D: Er, right OK. Where was the computer? Because it's not under the desk where they normally are.\n\n&gt;U: No, it was sat on the desk.\n\nCommence confused face, it's been a busy week, but I wasn't that tired that I missed a full computer tower on the desk.\n\n&gt;D: Right...OK, come with me, show me the computer.\n\nThe user lets out a sigh in the typical \"I don't have time for this\" and we head to the room.\n\n&gt;U: See, its there, on the desk next to the mouse and keyboard.\n\nShe points at the flat panel monitor.\n\n&gt;D: Erm...\n\nMy brain goes into meltdown, how the hell do I respond to something like that, this person quite firmly believes a computer monitor is the only part of a fully functioning workstation - before I'm accused this was a very flat monitor, very obviously not an AIO workstation either.\n\n&gt;D: Right...that's the computer monitor. That needs to go into the computer tower, they sit under everyone's desks, the big black boxes you turn on in a morning.\n\n&gt;U: ...No, that's the computer, you just need to move that *points at monitor*\n\nI've been in the job about 10 years. I know what a monitor looks like, at this point I'm losing the will to live, and as she's fairly new I go with this.\n\n&gt;D: Right...come with me.\n\nI take her next door to an empty office but with 3 fully setup workstations and sit her down.\n\n&gt;D: Right, what's this *points at the flat panel monitor*\n\n&gt;U: The computer.\n\n&gt;D: Right...and what's this? *points at the tower on the floor*\n\n&gt;U: Erm...\n\n&gt;D: Right, let me give you a little lesson. This *points at the monitor* is called the monitor, it can be called a display, panel, screen, a lot of different things.\n\n&gt;U: Ok...\n\n&gt;D: This, *points at the computer tower* is called the computer tower, or computer for short, it can be called many different things, desktop, PC and a lot of others, generally computer will suffice. OK?\n\n&gt;U: Yeah...I understand.\n\nAt this point she had gone the brightest shade of red. I wasn't aiming to embarrass her, I was genuinely teaching her the components of a workstation, I wasn't using any sort of condescending tones. \n\n&gt;D: I'm not trying to embarrass you or anything, or make fun of you. Just feel it's better you understand the differences.\n\n&gt;U: I know...I just feel stupid now. Sorry for wasting your time!\n\n&gt;D: Don't be sorry, I've dealt with stranger things and stranger requests! (not sure if that's true...) I'd rather I taught you it now, if you've never been shown the basics!\n\n&gt;U: Thank you, I appreciate that. So, when you get a COMPUTER from the other office, can you move the MONITOR and other things with it to the other room.\n\n&gt;D: Yep that's absolutely fine!\n\nShe walks back to her actual desk, still as red as a tomato. I chuckled to myself and carried on with my day. What shocked me was her age and that when she started about 2 months ago she didn't question anything with the computer and how to use it, so she's used one before in the past, and in her late teens it's hard not to have done..really. \n\nTL;DR Had to educate a user who genuinely thought a monitor was the main component of a workstation. We finished as friends and joke about it now.",

        "text": "Commented on this on a previous post, was asked to share.\n\nOur company developed the back end systems for our national cell phone carrier's prepaid mobile system (amongst other things) - recharge, billing, charge cards, etc.   Basically, they handled the actual telephony bit, and we did everything in behind that to make sure that they could make money off it.\n\nWe were preparing a major upgrade to the billing system, and had a few months of UAT.  We discovered a glitch that at a certain load, the system froze.  In order to debug, we had to basically crash the UAT mainframe to pick up what state all of the elements of the interfaces and billing system were in.\n\nEveryone was ready, prepared to monitor the various parts of the system as it was halted, to see if anything stood out as falling over in a manner that showed it could have been the problem.  20+ techs and leadership carefully watching screens, waiting for me to execute the kill command.\n\n\n3...2....1....Kill.\n\n\n\"Ready when you are....\"  \"Good to go....\" \"At your leisure....\"\n\n\n&lt;Production alarms sounding&gt;\n\n&lt;Sound of heart hitting floor&gt;\n\n\n\"ummmm, guys?\"\n\n\nWe had to wait for the system to finish crashing.  Then we had to start recovering the system from the crash.\n\n\nCalls that were in progress completed ok (but weren't billed).  No new calls could be placed from prepaid mobiles for eight hours while the crash completed, the system was recovered to a known good point and restarted.\n\n\n\nThe customer was slightly less than impressed, and a new HR policy was implemented whereby you could earn credits back to offset against major disasters (boss had my back to stop customer from firing me).\n\nA month later, I managed to track down a hole in the billing system that was leaking about $100,000 per month, so they slightly forgave me.\n\n\nAfter that, I set up different colours for each of our environments, with production having a red flashing banner.",

        "text": "Background, I work for a copier company as IT. I handle the installs when a customer gets a new copier, internal IT, and customer IT services as it relates to the copiers...\n\nThe line up:  \n$ME - Me!  \n$Bond - Customer (a bond service)  \n$salesPerson - $Bonds account rep\n\nHad a customer call in who got a new computer recently and needed print drivers reinstalled. No big deal as this happens relatively often. Biggest issue is whether or not the customer has a network contract with us. Typically there is a service contract that handles any thing wrong with the copier itself however this does not include anything on the network such as computers, network shares, etc. So if something changes on your network and you can't print/scan/etc then there will most likely be a charge unless you have the supplemental contract.\n\nBefore calling the customer back I quickly checked previous calls/notes to get an idea of what may need to be done. (was the drivers installed locally in the past or shared from a server. Pushed from group policies?) I noticed that they do not have a network contract and that they had called in the past for the same thing and ended up having the sales person install the drivers because they refused to pay any fees. (sales can do this if they want/if it's nothing more then local drivers. Also, previous sales person is different then current sales person who does not know how to install print drivers at this time) I had a feeling how this would go...\n\nI call the customer:  \n&gt;$Bond (after several rings) - Yes? (sounds busy)  \n**$Me - Oh, hello? (I was thrown off by the abrupt answer) I am $Me from $company. You called needing print drivers setup on a new computer right?**  \n$Bond - Right (Still sounds busy and distracted)  \n**$Me - I can call back later if now is not a good time...**  \n$Bond - No, I have lots of very important things I need to print out so lets get this taken care of now.  \n**$Me - Ok great. I do have to note that because you do not have a network contract that I will have to charge for this call. Is that ok?**  \n$Bond - Really? How much...  \n**$Me - If I remote in it'll be $minuteFee per 15 minutes or $minHourFee plus $travelFee if I come out.**  \n$Bond - I LEASE THIS MACHINE. I AM NOT PAYING MORE FOR THIS (I understand the thought, and often have the explain the limitation of the service contract. I don't get the opportunity)  \n**$Me - I have another... (CLICK, line goes dead) option, ok or not...**  \n\nI was going to offer to help $Bond find the correct print drivers so they could try it on their own. Some customers will take this option if they feel they can do it on their own or don't want to pay for the service or can't because someone else holds the purse strings.\n\nI hang up and chuckle a bit. Mention to a couple co-workers who had over heard my conversation what happened and they laugh at me for getting hung up on. All good.\n\n$Bond calls back later wanting to talk with their sales person who then talks with the service manager who, while will allow a freeby once in a while for such instances, agreed that since $Bond had been through this before, they should have known what would happen when they called this time.\n\nA couple hours later $Bond calls back. I answer the phone.\n\n&gt; **$Me - Hello, $company this is $Me. How can I help you.**  \n$Bond - Hello, I called earlier and talked with my sales person, account rep, whatever they are. They said they would call me back and I haven't heard from them. (Sounds short and gruff the whole time. Also, apparently didn't recognize my voice)  \n**$Me - I'm sorry about that. I believe $salesPerson is back in the office now (I had just seen them a few minutes ealier) I can transfer you to their office if would you like.**  \n$Bond - (Answers yes. Can't remember now how)  \n**$Me - Ok, one moment**  \n\nI transfer $Bond and poke my head in the service managers office to let him know $Bond had called back. He chuckled. As I am turning to leave $salesPerson walks up. They are really nice and try to please the customer any way possible. Not a bad trait really however it's easy to let a customer slide and then get them in the bad habit of expecting free services. It's happened many times...\n\nWe talk for a minute or two about how $salesPerson would like to let this one slide and that $Bond had said they need this now because they had a ton of important documents they needed printed right now and that they needed them so they could go catch a fugitive. I explained we've done this in the past already and this will become something $Bond will expect in the future. (Obviously already does) Ultimately the call was handed over to another IT person who is good with customers like this who got $Bond taken care of.\n\nPart of me would love to ignore the financial side and just take care of the customer, especially since I hate having financial conversations with customers. I'm IT. I can make your computer sing happy birthday to you but please don't make me ask for money...  \nThe other part of me stonewalls with customers like this. Ones who typically demand things from you without accepting any cost or consequence, blaming you for anything that goes wrong.\n\nTL:DR $Bond had fugitives to catch but refused to pay for our services so we could install his print driver so he could get his documents that allowed him to go after said fugitives. Or something like that...",

I had my \"dev\" console open on the right-hand monitor, and the \"prod\" console open on the left-hand monitor.  One evening, my work went something like this:\n\nright: New table schema looks good.  Let me just tweak this right here.   \nleft: Prod's table schema looks sane.  Alright, we should be ready to migrate my changes from dev.   \nright: Let's make sure the scripts work.  I'll drop the dev data and let the new scripts recreate the schema.    \nleft: TRUNCATE TABLE    \nright: ...      \nleft: ... oh poo.   \n\nFortunately this was a system that was used pretty much during work hours, and it was about 6pm.  It was also primarily read-only and only had new data loaded in every so often.  I spent about four hours reloading data (which mostly consisted of me watching data files copy from one drive to another for four hours) from the recent backup and nothing was really lost.  Also fortunately, when I informed my not-exactly-boss-but-the-guy-I-was-working-with-on-the-project-who-was-technically-my-superior what I had done, he spent some time laughing instead of yelling at me, because he knew we weren't in any serious danger of major outages or data loss.  \n\nThe moral of the story: don't assume you can remember your left from your right when it comes to prod data.",

Anyway, starting a couple of weeks ago she called us at 8am on the dot, which is when we arrive to our office.  \n&gt; **Her:** Hey, I'm trying to get into my virtual and it says it can't connect. Can you take a look at it?  \n\n&gt; **Me:** Yeah let me just look on my side real quick.  \n\nI check inside vSphere and sure enough, the VM is off. That's weird. Although I know the night before I had pushed some updates to her virtual, maybe that's it. In any case, I start her VM and let her know and she thanks me and that's it.  \n\nFast forward to the next day, 8am on the dot.  \n\n&gt; **Her:** Hey it looks like I can't get into my virtual again, can you check it out?  \n\n&gt; **Me:** Yeah let me take a look again.  \n\nSure enough, again, it's off. So again I turn it back on and she gets in without any issues. This goes on for the past couple of weeks because with everything else going on I just haven't had time to troubleshoot the issue. At this point I am just assuming something with Windows Updates.  \n\nFinally I get a chance to look at it. I check Windows Updates, nothing pending an install. So I check out the power settings; everything is normal there. Next, logs. I can see the virtual is shutting down and when but it doesn't give any sort of error message. In fact, it looks like a completely normal shutdown.  \n\nNow at this point and after doing some master Google work, I can find nothing so I took to /r/techsupport. There, someone told me I should see exactly *how* she was \"logging off\" at night. Okay? But she has been using this virtual for a few years now with no issue. So I contact her.\n\n&gt;**Me:** Hey, I was just wondering something. At night, do you log off and if so, how do you do it?  \n\n&gt; **Her:** I think I have done both disconnect and shut down.  \n\nAt this point I let her know that shutting down, shuts it off while disconnecting will leave it on. To which I get the simple reply of  \n\n&gt;**Her:** Makes sense. I will only disconnect.  \n\nI'm still trying to pick my jaw up off the floor.",

Recently another mass of updates were sent out to user's systems and because of this accounts are sometimes getting locked out. This is incredibly common for us and we don't even bat an eye when it occurs, just verify the information and unlock the account with our AD team. Simple, quick. 5 min call which is nice to pad the numbers with. Never should be so hard.\n\n$Me Thank you for calling $TechSupport this is $Me. Can I get your information?\n\n$Derp provides first and last name, and as per usual policy we verify everything. Phone number, desk location, email. We make sure we know exactly who we're talking to (Yes, it's that important)\n\n$Me: Alright, and how can I help you?\n\n$Derp: Well I can't log into my system. It's saying my account is locked.\n\n$Me: Okay, Can you tell me word for word exactly what it's telling you\n\nSadly these systems can lock accounts in several different ways, so the error message is very important\n\n$Derp: It says account locked\n\nMy elation flies into the air with a chorus of angels. A quick nice call and easy solution. Everything and everyone should be happy.\n\n$Me: Alright, let me put you on hold and contact $AD and we'll unlock you\n\nDerp is put on hold for a moment and $AD is contact. Quick hello and a name provided. After looking suddenly storm clouds come.\n\n$AD: That's odd, they're account isn't showing as locked.\n\nNot worried at all. Had one like this a week ago but still unlocking fixed it. We run the unlock anyway and I get back on phone with user.\n\n$Me: Alright, go ahead and log into the account\n\n$Derp: Okay... Nope still saying locked out\n\nAnd a thunderbolt strikes, frying my wings like a tech support Icarus as I plummet into a sea of confusion\n\n$Me: Okay, that's not right. What's the error message you're getting again?\n\nI verify it word for word, twice\n\n$Me: Okay are you using the correct credentials\n\n$Derp: Yes it's my name and it's asking for a pin\n\n$Me: Have you tried rebooting the system\n\n$Derp: Yes, several times. Still same error.\n\nAnd like that I'm awash and lost in the waters. I try to find anything else to explain this but I draw a loss. So, I start to get ready to send out a flare for support (onsite teams)\n\nSuddenly, with a mighty wack of a brick being thrown at me\n\n$Derp: Wait, there are two of us here. Are you looking at $DerpB\n\nAfter asking a little more I find out that $Derp is $DerpB, and to boot he had never called into support before. Oddly enough our ticket system is not connected to the AD or anything so we have to put in all new employees and add them to the ticket system. Verified with $DerpB that this is also his first time calling us so we don't even have his information in the system, and instead verified all the information for $DerpA without listening to any of it. \n\n$Me: Okay, let me get your information then\n\nI gather the information for $DerpB and double check every bit of it. Then I put on hold and contact $AD. Funny enough it was the same $AD as before and after a quick story of the swapped identity we find and unlock $DerpB\n\n$Me: Okay, go ahead and log in now\n\n$DerpB tried to log in and after a moment logs into the system. He thanks me and we part ways over the phones as my head hits the desk and I feel the annoyed rage churn for a while, hot enough to melt the sea of confusion before I go to my happy place of TFTS to share the story\n\nTLDR: User says they are user, verifies they are user, then suddenly says they are NewUser",

Now, here's where it get's fun. \n\n&gt; **$Braindead** Pppplllease don't erase any of my stuff! I don't want to lose anything! \n\nNow, the backstory with this is that about a month ago I had a ticket to \"increase the memory\" of a workstation, the user wanted more RAM that they didn't need since they weren't going over their cap but they got it in the end. I was working on a second ticket a few days later after I was waiting on their new sticks to get in to clear up some space on their drive. I accidentally deleted the user profile and had to wait after hours to restore it from the temporary one I set up since this user wasn't saving things correctly. I restored it from a file level backup and all was good. The user went on to complain to the entire office that I broke their computer when all they wanted was RAM and I shouldn't have been touching anything else. I had a ticket for it ( they had 5MB free). \n\n$Braindead sent a follow up ticket (a separate ticket in mind you,) making sure I don't delete their bookmarks either.\n\nTheir computer needed a simple restart. \n\nMFW.",

No idea how it got accepted for having so little information.\n\nMessaged her through Lync asking how I could help and if she could clarify what she meant. Apparently she had tried connecting from home and couldn't see her WiFi network, so she came into the office.\n\n&gt;Me: \"okay, can I remote in to take a look at the WiFi adapter when you have availability?\"\n\n&gt;Her: \"how is that going to help as I don't use the WiFi here?\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"I can check your WiFi adapter to see if it can detect networks and see if it needs the driver reinstalled\" (been seeing this lately after a round of updates, some users are getting their WiFi card drivers corrupted. Easy fix luckily)\n\n&gt;Her: \"are you not in the office? Why remote in if you can just walk over?\"\n\nOh boy. One, she's on the other side of the office, so it's a long walk. Two, Bomgar lets you connect quickly and allows quick access to various tools. Three, talking in person means no chat logs to log in the ticket. She's the kind of user where you need chat logs else she *will* lie about you.\n\nI told her how Bomgar is instant and allows tools to be acessed quickly.\n\n&gt;Her: \"that's not good customer service, most people would rather have you in person, remoting in is cold, communication is a huge issue in this company and IM is part of the issue [etc, etc]\" \n\n(WTF? IM logs everything, lets you reference the chats at any time, allows links and files, etc, IM software like Lync *helps* communication...)\n\nClearly there was no way around it, so I grabbed my handy dandy notebook in case I needed to jot down what I found and headed over.\n\nShe explained everything she already explained, I sat down...\n\n...and instantly found the WiFi adapter had no issues. Everything was enabled, it could see the networks around us, no errors, nothing.\n\nSo, I confirmed that it could connect to the local WiFi and everything worked. \n\nI told her what I had found and explained that there was nothing wrong with the laptop.\n\nShe laughed at me.\n\nShe completely refused to listen to what I was showing her. I told her she would need to check her home router/modem and possibly power cycle them.\n\nShe would just keep chuckling and would say straight to my face that I was wrong and didn't know what I was talking about (let's ignore my years of experience I guess?) and that the problem was the laptop.\n\nSo, okay, I explained maybe it's a corrupt WiFi profile, so I showed her how I removed the WiFi networks and how she would need to add hers back if she can see the network when she got home. If she still can't see it, it has to be the home network.\n\nShe just laughed at me and said she knows it's the laptop and I'm wrong because her husband works in IT.\n\nShe was still chuckling as I left.\n\nI emailed my manager to cut ahead of her in case she contacted him, and the helpdesk manager to warn helpdesk of an unprofessional user that may call in later and what I have already done.\n\n***Update: March 2nd*** - today she revealed she was able to see her home network after all.... But she put in the password wrong and didnt know how to correct it. \n\nI assume, from all the evidence, this means her first ticket was a blatant lie and she could see her network from the beginning.",

I don’t know what a task bar is.\n\nIgnoring task bar question \n\n&gt; A: Where are you going to connect to WiFi?\n\n&gt; T: Windows Settings\n\nMutes phone while I pound my skull into my desk\n\n&gt; A: No please use your WiFi menu from the sys tray. You should see the national WiFi symbol to the left of your clock. \n\n&gt; T: Okay I guess I’ll try it\n\nYeah okay thanks I mean you could get off the phone and try whatever you’d like by yourself\n\nI hear her reading through networks and she mentions the guest network. Again I try not to jump to help until I am asked. I pepper in the comment “I don’t think you are a guest, you will want the main network”\n\n&gt; T: Ok give me just a second more\n\nWaits in agonizing misery as I know this is taking longer than it should\n\n&gt; T: Cannot connect\n\n&gt; A: Is it giving you a reason?\n\n&gt; T: That is the reason, it cannot connect. Laptop must be bad. I have a dell at home and the “little main control thing” (no idea what shes blabbering on about) is on the right. This laptop must be from Europe or something (It’s a thinkpad…) \n\nI attempt to scoff at quite possibly the dumbest thing I will here this month\n\n&gt; A: Heh… Okay well we must have the password wrong, lets give this another shot. Read back the password you are typing in as you type it. (Find this forces users to slow down and avoids fat fingering)\n\n&gt; T: Okay if you really think I need to I’ll try again: Okay lets see here *Company WiFi Guest* and then capital *T* \n\nI interrupt\n\n&gt; A: I’m sorry are we connecting to the guest?\n\n&gt; T: Yes \n\n&gt; A: Okay that will be our issue, you aren’t a guest you work there so you will need to connect to the main WiFi named *Company WiFi* \n\n&gt; T: Well at the beginning you told me to connect to guest \n\nDidn’t even respond. 3 years at this company and not once have I told a single end user to connect to our guest network but apparently I do it for the first time ever on this phone call. \n\n&gt; A: Please connect to the correct WiFi. Let me know how it goes.\n\nFinally she gets connected. I walk her through her O365 product activation. Reset one of her passwords (she’s worked here 2 weeks) and ensured nothing else needed to be done. \n\n&gt; A: Thanks for taking the time with me **Terrible End User**, I hope you have an amazing day!\n\n*Click* \n\nHung up immediately after I finished the sentence. Had no need to listen to her plastic response.\n\nTL;DR Spent 20 minutes connecting someone to WiFi on a European computer that must be bad.\n",

        "text": "I work esclations for an ISP.\n\n&gt;me:  This is Nik.  How may I help?\n\n&gt;$cst:  I hope you can help.  You need to tell me my IP address.  The other person couldn’t tell me.\n\n&gt;Me:  Ma’am, for security reasons I typically don’t give out public IP addresses.  Now you should be able to go to a site like whatismyip and it will tell you.\n\n&gt;$cst: I am not going to the internet to get some generic ip address to connect my VCR to the internet.  You can’t help me, I need to talk to someone else.\n\nNot a misquote.  I just shrug and figure she is talking about a bluray.\n\n&gt;me:  Ma’am there are two types of ip addresses.  Public IP addresses which we give you and private or local ip addresses which your router gives you.  If your VCR is asking you for an IP it is not acting correctly because it isn’t automatically pulling the information it should have gotten.\n\n&gt;$cst: I just moved.  You guys got this VCR to work at my old place.  You just need to give me that IP address.  I need to talk to someone else.  You don’t know how to help customers.\n\n&gt;me:  Ma’am, I’m trying to explain to you that your VCR will get an IP automatically if it is working right.  If I were to give you an IP address to place into that VCR, it might not work.  Even worse if a static IP is done wrong, you will kick another device off of your internet connection making it worse because both the VCR and that device will be trying to use the same private or local IP.\n\nI didn’t have this customer’s account up because we got fixated on this IP address thing a bit too quickly.  I was standing up looking at the elevators to my building.  An initial tier supervisor that I’ve known for years is giving me a quizzical look trying to figure out why I am using VCR and IP in the same sentance.  I am trying really hard not to laugh.\n\n&gt;$cst:  You can’t talk customer.  I am talking customer talk, and you don’t make any sense.  I need to talk to someone else.\n\n&gt;me:  You have already reached an escalation line.  The only route I would have to send you to, would be to bring up your account and fill out a form.  You will need to wait for a supervisor callback in 24 hours.\n\n&gt;$cst: I am not waiting 24 hours for someone to help me with something you guys have helped me with before.  I pay you way to much to wait 24 hours.  I need to speak with someone else.\n\n&gt;me:  Ma’am, I am already an esclation line that is what I would be able to do.\n\n&gt;$cst:  What does that even mean?  Esclated line?  Tell me how many of your customer’s actually know what esclated line means?\n\nI pause trying to gather my thoughts on how to respond.  I cannot identify myself as a supervisor and honestly out of every time I have had to say those words, she is the only person ever to ask me what it means.\n\n&gt;$cst:  Exactly.  No one knows what that means.  How do you expect me to know what none of your customers understand.\n\n&gt;me: Let me bring up your account to make sure your internet is working right.  Now if...\n\n&gt;$cst:  Did I ever say my internet wasn’t working?  No my internet is just fine.  It is my VCR that is not working and I need the IP.  Do I need HDMI1, 2, or 3?\n\n&gt;me: I don’t know.\n\n&gt;$cst:  I need to know which one do I need.  You knew this information before at my old place.\n\n&gt;me:  Ma’am that has to do with your VCR connecting to your TV not the internet.  That is a physical connection that we have no information on.\n\n&gt;$cst:  Well is it wired or wireless?\n\n&gt;me: I don’t know, that has to do with a physical connection.\n\n&gt;$cst:  You have to know it’s your internet.\n\n&gt;me: Ma’am I don’t know your physical connections and if there is a cable going from your VCR to your router.\n\n&gt;$cst:  You know your service.  Are you wired or wireless.\n\n&gt;me:  At our core we are a wired service and only directly provided a wired connection.  However, most customers chose to have wireless and oftentimes connect most of their devices wirelessly.  It all depends on the physical connection.\n\n&gt;$cst:  It’s telling me I don’t have a connection and to verify that my cable is connected.  What do I do now?\n\n&gt;me:  Ma’am you need to contact the manufacturer of your VCR.\n\nWith that she hung up on me.\n\nTL:DR-  Customer tried to manually connect her “VCR” the internet and spent a half an hour trying to argue that she needed to be told information her ISP didn’t have.\n\nEdit: grammar mistakes",

        "text": "So this situation happens quite often for me, but a few months ago I got the perfect ending to finally make a good story. I'm also not really \"tech support\" so forgive me if I use terms that are wrong.  \n\nI don't work at a help desk, but for my company part of my job is user account creation/removal for a web only application (APP). Getting into the system requires a special ticket. Once I get this ticket, I approve or reject the user creation request (depending on the user's job function they are assigned specific roles with varying levels of access). As long as everything looks fine and the user was requested the correct level of access, I approve, then manually add the employee to the system. \n\nOver the years, my company has made it EXTREMELY clear there's no getting around this system. Everything has to be by the book. \n\nOn a random Tuesday, I get a very reasonable email from LAZY LADY asking how to get into APP. I get questions like this all the time. I send her a PDF of an SOP and a link to a YouTube video that walks her step by step on exactly how to request access for her specific role.\n\nI get an email back and have this exchange. \n\n&gt;Lazy Lady: I don't have time for this. Please just add me to APP. \n\n&gt;Me: Sorry, I know this can be a tedious process, but our company requires it. You'll need to complete these steps before I can add you to APP. Attached again are the directions and a video. Let me know if you have specific issues. \n\nA few hours later I get an email from Lazy Lady. I roll up my sleeves to answer some questions. Nope. It's just an image file of some kind of Word doc I've never seen before asking for access to APP. \n\n&gt;Me: This isn't how you request access. As we discussed previously, here are the directions and video. If you want, we can do a screenshare. \n\n\nA few days go by and I get a CC'ed on an email from our company's Tech Support Desk. \n\n&gt;Lazy Lady: I was told to contact the help desk to get me into APP (lies!!!). I need access asap. \n\n&gt;Help Desk Gunslinger: We have never supported APP, but SCSM can help you. I've CCed him. \n\n&gt;Me: Hi, As we discussed previously, here are the directions and video. If you want, we can do a screenshare. \n\nI hear crickets back. A few days later I get an email in a support inbox for my department that I also monitor. Guess who? \n\n&gt;Lazy Lady: It's been a week and I still don't have access to APP. I was told someone who monitors this inbox could get me into APP. \n\n&gt;Me: Hi, I've actually been speaking with you this whole time. As we discussed previously...\n\nSo if you're keeping track, she's filled out paperwork (that maybe she made herself?), filled out a support ticket, and then asked around to get an email address just so she didn't have to spend 5 minutes doing the actual process. \n\nThen she emails me directly again CCing her manager. \n\n&gt;Lazy Lady: Manager, I've been trying to get into APP for over a week and no one is helping me. \n\n&gt;Manager: That's ridiculous, SCSM what are you doing to get Lazy Lady into APP? We need this done right now. \n\n&gt;Me: See attached emails of our previous convos. \n\n&gt;Manager: Oh. Lazy Lady, just follow the directions provided. This seems easy. \n\nThe next morning I get a notification that Lazy Lady completed her user request! The nightmare is over! \n\nNope. \n\nShe did it wrong. I had to reject her request. \n\n&gt;Me: Lazy Lady, I had to reject your user request. You didn't do it right. Did you follow the directions? \n\n&gt;Lazy Lady: Yes (lies!!!)\n\n&gt;Me: Well... you need to do it again. Let's just do a screenshare. \n\n&gt;Lazy Lady: What's that? \n\n&gt;Me: ...\n\nSo after 10 minutes of me on the phone trying to walk her through how to share her screen, we finally get connected. I swear this is the opening conversation: \n\n&gt;Me: Ok, you'll open up your web browser. \n\n&gt;Lazy Lady: What? \n\n&gt;Me: ...your web browser? \n\n&gt;Lazy Lady: Please don't use tech speak. \n\n&gt;Me: Go to the internet. \n\n&gt;Lazy Lady: OK. \n\n&gt;Me: That's Outlook... Go to the blue \"E\". Now go to www.website.com/app. No, you just did a google search for website.com/app. Go to the bar at the top of your screen...\n\nThen I realized, Lazy Lady wasn't Lazy Lady, she was Incompetent Lady. \n\nAfter taking 30 minutes on something that should easily take under 5, she was finally in APP. \n\nThree days later I come into work and get a system notification. \n\n&gt;Remove LAZY LADY from APP. Reason: Employee Terminated. \n\nAt least there's some justice in the world. \n\n",

        "text": "Hey all,\n\nLong time lurker, first time poster so sorry about any formatting issues up front. \n\nSo, I'm a contractor front desk desktop support guy at a big gov't contractor. Think Geek Squad or Apple Store. I know, stupid right? Anyway, this job quite frankly sucks. It's one tier better than Helldesk, with probably just as many walk-ins/calls, but I suffer through. \n\nPeople walk up to me, I help them out to the best of my ability. I may not look and/or sound happy while doing it, but I do my best to get my users solutions or answers they need. Or I direct them to who can.\n\nI don't have problems with 99% of the users at this place, they're all usually nice, if not typically inept at tech or needy. In some instances, I can even come across as the irritable one. But this woman today caused the first time in my year at this place that I've ever been mad at a user. And this is the second \"instance\" with her.\n\nSo, in typical work day fashion, I am the only one on time at this front desk ~20-25 minutes after we've officially \"opened\" for the day. I have two other co-workers. A woman whom I've seen before strolls on in with her laptop.\n\n&gt;**Her:** \"Hey, I have weird files on my laptop. What's going on?\"\n\nNow, I've already had roughly 8 users this week come in with the same \"concern.\" One of the security team's applications has been putting some randomly named files and folders on machine's C drives to prevent against viruses and malware in some way.\n\n&gt; **Me:** \"Are they weirdly named files and folders..?\"\n\n&gt; **Her:** \"Yes, they are.\"\n\n&gt; **Me:** \"Okay, you're one of 8 or more people who've come in this week with the same problem, I can assure you there's no issue. It's a Security application doing this. There's no malware or anything of the sort.\"\n\nSounds like an apt reason behind this phenomena right? It's what's on the company website! I'm just reiterating what I've been told. Now, cue this woman:\n\n&gt; **Her:** \"Are you sure? Even my co-workers told me this is weird. Can you look at it?\"\n\n&gt; **Me:** \"Yep, it is weird, but there's no issue. No need to look at the laptop I promise.\"\n\n&gt; **Her:** \"Whatever, have a good day.\"\n\nAnd I thought that was the end of it. Until my lead tells me he received an email from this very same user with the head of plant digital security CC'd... she claim's I was \"rude,\" \"wouldn't even bother taking a look at her laptop\" (which is technically accurate since I knew exactly what she was talking about), and wanted to check with him personally to see if I was right. Or else \"now he's aware that there are viruses around the plant :)\"\n\nWell, my lead mentions this to me, and begins drafting up an email to her and the head of security as I'm about to leave for the day. Here's to hoping that he has my back.",

        "text": "I work at a small shop that, among other things, serves as IT for local businesses too small to have their own IT team. We usually work remotely (or at least try to) with the occasional on-site visit. \n\nEarly one morning, one of our clients (a gym) is having trouble getting audio out of the computer that usually plays music and projects video for their organized classes. My coworker has already spent 30 minutes on the phone and on remote desktop troubleshooting, to no avail. According to the client, the speaker cable is plugged into the correct port on the back, the speakers are on and play audio from his phone just fine, but they can't get anything to play out of the computer itself. All software is showing no issues. Coworker's stumped, and expects that the audio card must have pooped out or some other hardware failure occurred (it's a moderately old computer).\n\nI live nearby, so he calls me, exasperated and worried, wondering if I'd bail him out by picking up a spare audio card from a local store and install on-site since they have a class in an hour and really need this solved (as it'd take him longer to get down there). So I stop at our local big box electronics store (ugh) and buy an overpriced crappy audio card to throw in there. Might be overkill, but time is limited and I wanted to get it solved quickly.\n\nI get on site, and start diagnosing. And, like anyone who's been working in IT for more than a month (or has read TFTS for more than 5 minutes), I always start by checking the client's work regardless of what I've been told previously.\n\n&gt;\"Yep, speakers are plugged into the correct port on the back.\"  \n&gt;\"Speakers themselves are fine too, audio comes out fine from my phone.\"  \n&gt;\"Ok, let's try the front audio port... wait...\"  \n\nAnd that's when I notice. Someone has managed to snap off a headphone plug inside the front audio jack, so deep in there you can't even see it unless you're staring straight at the port. Of course, the computer's behavior is set to play audio only through the front port if something is plugged into it, and according to the computer, something sure is! 2 minutes with a multi-tool later, and everything is fine. I leave the client to berate whatever employee was working the previous night who:  \n1) Broke their headphones off in the computer  \n2) Left without telling anybody  \n3) Caused the client to be billed a full hour of IT time  \n\nSome things you'd just never guess to diagnose remotely. Guess I should go return this audio card.",

Then I look up at the projector, and discover the issue........Somehow or another the HDMI cable has been unplugged from the Projector. \n\nI get up on a chair, and plug the cable back into the projector. Wouldn't you know, the image immediately pops up on the screen.\n\nNow, I wouldn't necessarily expect a normal teacher to catch this, but this woman has been doing IT for longer than I have and she is in charge of teaching the teachers how to effectively use technology in the classroom.

        "text": "So background to make it clear, I provide IT support for numerous schools. That should sum it up.\n\nMonday morning I open my emails, and there's one from a teacher in a school sent at 1930 on Friday, saying the entire computer room is offline. I reply with asking when this happened, and I also confirm I can see the server online, which is in the computer room.\n\nI am told that this happened on the Tuesday, and it's really important it gets fixed soon. Now I am not due out in that school until later in the month, so re-arranging my usual to rush out is going to be an issue, but I ask them to check that the comms rack is all powered up, as everything in the computer room, bar the server, goes through one switch. They say it looks like it's off, and I ask them to just make sure every cable is plugged in tightly. They all are. (Remember this part).\n\nSo I re-arrange everything and rush out Tuesday afternoon. Get into the school, go to the comms rack, open it, all switches are on. One cable, which connects the switch for the computer room back to the main switch, is unplugged.\n\nI ask the teacher to explain, and they claim I need to apologise for being rude, that they are not stupid, they have worked in IT.\n\nYet they couldn't check for one single cable.......\n\nI'm writing up a nice document making it clear from now on that emergency call outs like this will not be answered anymore, that any outages need to be reported on the day, if not the very hour, it has happened. I thought we already had that clear. Clearly for \"used to work in IT\", it wasn't.",

        "text": "[Part the first](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7yqsub/i_guess_my_job_description_includes_everything/).  \n  \nI've been tasked to help TravelSite, a shell of a company. I'm not sure what I'm doing and I suspect the same from the client.   \n  \nI've set up a visit to TravelSite's headquarters with some interviews. I've asked Mike &amp; Spider for documentation- how data flows through their application, network maps and the like.    \n \nIn the few days between my request and the visit, I've received nothing from Spider or Mike. While I'm driving to their site I call the person who set this up, my ex boss.   \n  \nEx-Boss:\"How's it going with TravelSite?\"  \n  \nme:\"I'm not sure. What did you promise them?\"  \n  \n \nEx-Boss:\"You're smart. Figure out what they need and execute\"  \n  \nme:\"Is there a statement of work I should read?  \n  \nEx-Boss:\"This is a handshake deal. We're doing the assessment as a favor. Remediation is whatever you can work out\"  \n  \nme:\"So, you're doing this as a favor to them and I'm doing as a favor to you. I see how this works\"  \n    \nEx-Boss:\"Good\" \n  \nI find my way to TravelSite's offices. As expected, it's a ghost town. I get to meet Spider, their web designer tasked with keeping the lights on.  \n  \nSpider isn't his real name. I named him Spider because he reminded me of what happens when a hipster spider monkey discovered vintage biker amphetamines. He's jangly and pretentious.    \n  \nSpider's bringing me to their primary server room while talking to either me or someone on the phone.   \n  \nMe:\"So, Spider, how many employees are left?\"  \n \nSpider:\"Yeah. Yeah.\"  \n  \nMe:\"I'll stop asking questions\"  \n  \nSpider:\"You don't have to be an asshole\"  \n  \nMe:\"Hey. We'll talk when you're done with that call\"  \n  \nSpider:\"No, it's cool\"  \n  \nSpider stops in front of glass doors. The server room is small and built for show. There are maybe 4 rows of cabinets with a curved desk in the middle. There are windows on all four sides and the central desk has nice curved monitors and expensive chairs with \"Do not remove from server room\" decals on the back.  \n  \nSpider opens the door with a key card and lets me in.   \n  \nSpider:\"See?\"  \n  \nMe:\"It's a server room. Is there a map or inventory to tell us what all this does?\"  \n  \nSpider:\"That's why you're here. Everything's unreliable. The website's down for Microsoft Edge users\"  \n  \nMe:\"That's awfully specific. Are you doing anything odd on the website?\"  \n  \nSpider (clearly getting agitated):\"Look. It's not working\"  \n  \nSpider pulls open a cabinet door and pulls out the monitor and keyboard. Up pops a Windows Server 2012 login screen. Spider logs in and opens a browser. TravelSite's website appears.   \n  \nSpider:\"See?\"   \n  \nMe:\"Yep. That looks good to me\"  \n  \nSpider reaches over to the desk and grabs his tablet with flimsy keybord attached. He jabs at the browser and it's blank.  \n  \nSpider:\"See?\"  \n  \nSpider then goes over to the rack and holds down the power key on the top server until it powers off. He looks at the display of his tablet for a few seconds, then powers down the next server.  \n  \nI'm staring at him, not sure what's going on. He's still looking at his device, the powers down another server and starts up the top server.  \n  \nme:\"Uhhh? Why are you bouncing the entire rack?\"  \n  \nSpider:\"It's worked in the past, bro\"  \n  \nAnother man walks up. It's Mike, from marketing.  \n  \nMike:\"Good to see you. Can you get everything up and fixed in a week?\"  \n  \nme:\"I don't even know what's broken or what fixed looks like\"  \n  \nMike(looking pained and frustrated):\"Dammit! I asked you if you could fix everything\"  \n  \nme:\"I don't think I said I could\"  \n  \nSpider(poking angrily at his tablet):\"Shit's still down\"  \n  \nme:\"Look- the noise in here is getting to me. Can we talk somewhere else?\"  \n  \nMike leads the way to a few empty cubicles outside the server room.  \n  \nme:\"It seems we got off on the wrong foot. Let me see if I can come up with a plan that works. I'm guessing neither of you know what you have there and how it all works.\"  \n  \nSpider:\"I know how the website works\"  \n  \nme:\"Ok, that's a good start. Is it hosted here and at another datacenter? Any hybrid cloud or CDNs?\"  \n  \nSpider:\"Why does that matter?\"  \n  \nme:\"Um. Because. Because you can't find the schematic that shows how everything works.   \n  \nSpider:\"It uses javascript. That's how it works\"  \n  \nMike:\"I think you're getting bogged down in details. This all has to work fine by next week\"  \n  \nme:\"Ok. Give me a week and I could have a few people in here who could keep it running. That won't be cheap\"  \n  \nMike:\"Everything has to be fixed by then. And we're not paying for any extra people\"  \n  \nme:\"Look. I think this isn't going to work. Let me logon on your guest wifi so I can email my ex- boss and your boss with what I learned today. We'll have to come up with alternatives\"\n  \nMike:\"I'm not happy about this. You promised\"  \n   \nme:\"Uhh. I don't think I promised anything.\"  \n  \nI can't seem to get on their wireless. I spy some no-name wireless router under a cubicle. I figure nobody's relying on it, so I pull a Spider and pull the power for a few seconds.  \n  \nI'm able to connect my laptop to their network and I type up some quick notes in an email. I recommend an alternate strategy where TravelSite will transfer their customers, domains, trademarks and any other intellectual property, but we'll take care of winding down operations for the buyer at the same price. \n  \nI don't think it'll work, but I have to suggest something, lest I be one of those 'negative, no solution people that my ex-boss likes to complain about.  \n  \nA minute or two I hear Spider yelling that we're back up on Edge. It takes me a minute or two to realize that, in a way I'm responsible.   \n  \nI finish my notes and send them to my boss. I figure my boss can contact the client himself. I want to test Spider. I reach down and unplug the router.   \n  \nme:\"Hey, Spider! Is the site down on Edge again? It's down for Firefox as well\"  \n  \nSpider starts poking at his tablet. He's clearly unhappy and looks ready to fling the tablet.  \n  \nI plug the router back in.   \n  \nme:\"See, it's fixed\"  \n  \nSpider:\"What? What did you do?\"  \n  \nme:\"You tested the other browsers from an ethernet connection. Your test with Edge you did from a mobile device. The router was just confused\"  \n  \nSpider:\"You're wrong. Why would Edge use a different network than the other browsers?\"  \n  \nme:\"Because they're on different hosts?\"  \n  \nSpider:\"That's stupid. You don't know what you're talking about\"  \n  \nme:\"Er, you're clearly right. I'll leave now and let you know what my boss says\"  \n  \nI get in my car and drive home. My Ex-boss tells me some bad news. TravelSite already has a deal negotiated for sale of an operating business. The buyer is expecting a bunch of things, like maintained systems.  \n  \nAnd PCI compliance.  \n  \n[To be continued...](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/823bcx/i_guess_my_job_description_includes_everything/)\n\n  \n",

        "text": "This occurs in our corporate office a few years ago.  We lease out a large part of the down stairs office to a company that was loosely affiliated with my company at one time.  This company does electrical engineering type stuff particularly in the area of power quality and monitoring.  (This will be significant later in the story.)  They have test equipment throughout the building that they use for demonstration purposes.  Originally I was their Network Administrator/Helpdesk/Whipping boy on a time and material basis and with the understanding of \"as time permits.\"\n\nYou can guess how well that went.  Everything was an emergency.  Everything was a crisis.  Everything demanded as response immediately.\n\nSo eventually my boss decided it just wasn't worth the hassle and told them to find their own IT person.  Which they did.\n\nIt was agreed that, once he came on board, I would give them a 30 day window to turn over to them.\n\nTheir network was simple and fit all in one rack:  An SBS Server (2008), a Cisco switch, a Cisco ASA Firewall, a barracuda spam filter, a barracuda backup server, a UPS, four PCs (yes…four people), two printers, the aforementioned test equipment, and a Cable modem to the local ISP.\n\nSo honestly for any entry level network admin, this wasn't a huge stretch.  In fact, in our discussions with them we had recommended they use the local computer shop, who was easily capable of handling this network on a T&amp;M basis.\n\nOur advice was, as usual, ignored.\n\nI digress.  So we had 30 days to turn this over.  On the first day of the turn over, I met the new network admin ($NNA) and he seemed like a decent guy.  The turn over took about two hours.  So now we have about ~29 days left.  During the turnover I noticed the UPS battery light was on.   Some quick mental math and yep, it was about due for being replaced.  I told $NNA not to worry about it, I'd get it replaced and swapped out.\n\nAbout a week later the battery came in and I announced to them and $NNA that I was going to swap out the battery Friday night after 5 PM and the servers and routers would all be down while I replaced it.\n\nFriday comes, I shut everything down, swap the battery, start everything up, test mail flow and shares, and boom, I'm out of there.\n\nTwo weeks pass.  Suddenly the \"boss\" from this company (we'll call him $HI - Head Idiot) is in my doorway.\n\n\"The F&amp;#king meters don't work\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\" I said\n\n\"The f&amp;#king meters…they don't work.  We can't demo them to our customers.  I need them fixed now.\"\n\n\"Okay…why aren't you telling this to $NNA?\"\n\n\"He said you broke them.\"\n\n\"Me?\"  I said.  \"What did I do?\"\n\n\"I don't know but they were working last week and now they're not.\"\n\n\"$HI, I haven't touched your network in two weeks.  You have a network admin now so I'm not doing anything without his approval.  I suggest you talk to him.\"\n\n\"I did and he said you f&amp;#king broke them when you replaced the battery a few weeks ago.\"\n\nAt this point, this is almost comical if this guy wasn't such a prick.\n\n\"Look $HI, I don't know what he told you and I don't particularly care.  Replacing a battery in a UPS that powers your servers and routers and such is not going to affect your test equipment.  They aren't plugged into it in any way.  Besides that was two weeks ago and you just said they were working last week…so….\"\n\n\"I don't give a shit.  You broke them, you fix them.\"\n\n\"Fine, $HI, lets go take a look…\"\n\nSo we went down to one of the test meters, grabbing $NNA as we went to the telco room where some of these were mounted.  As soon as we got in the room it was pretty apparent what was going on.  The Cat 5 cable that was normally plugged in and connected to their network was still plugged in but now the one end of it was lying on the floor cut.\n\n\"Did you guys even look at this?\" I asked.\n\n$NNA looks at the room like he'd never been the before (which he likely hadn't.)\n\n\"Um….no….\"$ Hi stuttered.\n\nI got on my phone and called my boss. $BB.\n\n\"$BB, was they any one working in the telco room last week?\"\n\n\"Yeah, they were some electricians in there getting the old PBX out of there and cleaning up the loose wires.\"\n\n\"Ah…makes sense.  They cut a wrong wire.\"\n\n\"Bummer.\"  Said $BB.\n\nI pulled the cat5 out of the test device and handed it to $HI.\n\nAs I walked out the room, I looked at $NAA and said \"Looks like you got some wiring to do.\"\n\n\nTL;DR:  Electrical Engineering company fails the simplest troubleshooting task in order to blame me for an issue.\n",

In reality were just a bunch of weirdos with no social skills\")\n\nFor those of you unaware what a laser cutting setup looks like, you essentially have four separate machines working together (ours does anyway). You have the cutter itself which contains the actual laser and the cutting bed, the extractor/filter that sucks all of the nasty gasses away, the compressor unit that sits on top of the extractor to condense the water that gets evaporated out of materials like MDF and cardboard when we cut it, and the computer hooked up to it all. We have a starting checklist that should be performed every time you use the cutter that just makes sure that everything is on and it's all focused and everything.\n\nNow, I'm not the only one allowed to use the cutter, in fact any of the students are with teacher supervision, it's just that I know how to fix it when it goes wrong. So, when Student X comes up to me and asks to use the cutter I'm all like \"sure, make sure you've got a teacher there AND REMEMBER TO DO THE CHECKLIST\". I go back to marking my maths, and think nothing of it. I should note here that the extractor also works to cool the thing being cut so it doesn't catch fire. Guess what happened. I'm sitting there, peacefully berating  student's maths when the fire alarm goes off. Well shit. Student X was cutting some 6mm wood, didn't do the checklist, didn't turn the extractor on, the wood caught fire and the whole school got evacuated. The fire cracked the lens of the cutter carriage, so no cutting until further notice. Repair tech is booked for Monday. ",

        "text": "Again, this goes back to my time working retail tech support for a major home networking company in 2004/2005.\n\nAnyone working retail tech support is probably familiar with \"relay calls,\" but for those who aren't, a relay call is what it's called when a deaf person makes a phone call using some sort of terminal/phone system. They type into their terminal, and an operator reads (or \"relays\") what is typed to the person on the other end. The person on the other end (me) then speaks back to the operator who then types back to the deaf person on the terminal. This effectively triples the time a support call should take.\n\n*--*\n\n**Operator:** \"I got a new XX-XXX wireless router and it won't connect anymore.\"\n\n**Me:** *&lt;goes through all the standard stuff, rebooting the computer, rebooting the router, resetting the router to default, a 30/30/30 reset. Being a relay call, this probably took us to about 45 minutes. The whole time, he's asking for an RMA as often as he can.&gt;*\n\"Can we try this on another computer to ensure that it's the router and not your computer?\n\n**O:** This is my only computer.\n\n**Me:** Okay, then we'll need to try your computer on another network to determine which device has the problem. If it's the router, we'll do an RMA.\n\n**O:** How am I supposed to try it on another network?\n\n**Me:** Do you have wifi at work, so you can bring your laptop there?\n\n**O:** No, I'm living at a seminary, studying to be a priest. I don't have a job anywhere else.\n\n**Me:** Okay, maybe you can bring it to a friend's place. Once we've determined the laptop is not the issue, we'll RMA your router right away.\n\n**O:** I'M A LONE WOLF, I DON'T BELIEVE IN FRIENDS! *(emphasis mine, but I imagine he typed this to the operator in all caps.)*\n\nwe go back and forth a bit and I'm trying to explain that we need to prove the router is faulty before doing an RMA. Eventually my manager tells me to just give it to him.\n\n**Me:** Okay, the RMA has been approved. All you have to do is sent the router and a copy of the receipt to *&lt;address redacted/forgotten&gt;*\n\n**O:** I don't have the receipt. \n\n**Me:** Sorry, we need proof of purchase before we can do an RMA.\n\n**O:** I got it as a gift. *(from who?? he doesn't believe in friends!)*\n\n**Me:** Can you ask the person who gave it to you to get the receipt? It's necessary, or there's nothing I can do.\n\n**O:** *(speaking for herself now)* He hung up. I'm not allowed to repeat what he typed, but it begins with \"F.\" *(the call lasted about 90 minutes)*\n\n*--*\n\n\nEpilogue: He called back later that night and got another tech, who was able to fix the router over the phone after another hour and a half with a 30/30/30 reset, leading me to believe he didn't really follow my instructions when I asked him to do it, and was just trying to get the RMA from the beginning.",
