It made me realize that I've seen more comments about this association in the past few weeks than I have in the past two or three decades.\n\nI'm aware that it has to do with Harry Potter, but it's an IP that's been around since the early 2000s, and I thought the controversy dealt more with her transphobia. I've seen the goblins and they seem like the typical parallel to the harmless goblin trope that I grew up with in the 90s -- that is, hoarding gold and treasure, and existing in the confines of dungeons and mines. I've seen the same trope being used between then and now without controversy in all forms of media.\n\nI understand that the depiction of a goblins are all inherently based off centuries of past-antisemitism, and deeply ingrained in its image, but I thought that its provenance and past imagery kind of died out, and was replaced by Western literature.\n\nLike the image that I think of when I hear \"goblin\" is a product of antisemitism, but I don't think artists are really thinking \"Jewish person\" anymore when they make that depiction -- they're just thinking the typical goblin trope.\n\nIs there any particular reason as to why this stereotype is making a rebound? It can't be attributed to just a game with how frequently I'm seeing this as of late. Is there something bigger picture that I'm missing?",

Why is the Sphinx even closed for excavation and exploration in the first place?\n\n(The article in my first link quotes a Sphnix documentary, and I'm unaware of its agenda/accuracy.)",
