Turns out the receiver works perfectly and nothing is wrong with it. The problem lied in the \"head\" shooting the rays wich was not shooting said rays. They fucking asked me dead serious to just dismount the machine and find and fix what was wrong. They even got upset when i noped the fuck out of a such dangerous task (bear in mind i'm just an IT tech and not an expert in their specific machines of the field). I ragedly charged double for just the PC work. This things works with 220ac that excites a radioactive something generating a ray channeled to send a precise stream. Fucking killing teratogen black magic fuckery. I literally said them \"nope I like my DNA the way it is and don't need another arm or something\". Fucking call an expert.",

So in these events I am helping my mom solve a fight between my brothers. All IT was done on my brothers xbox 360.\n\nMe = me\n\nBro1 = brother whose account was \"deleted\"\n\nBro2 = brother who \"deleted\" account\n\nMom = my mom\n\nso I'm minding my business when my mom comes and asks for my help fix Bro1's account. I ask him what's wrong and he says \"Bro2 deleted my account and everything I've ever done and ruined everything\". so I go on to explain that its probably just the account link and that accounts are backed to the cloud and how you can't \"delete\" stuff from the cloud via xbox 360 (with their expertise it would be impossible). So as he pouts and goes to show me what the problem is I begin to think that Bro2 might have just removed his game data which would have led to more drama between Bro1/Bro2 and my mom. He turns the xbox on and sure his profile isn't there. so I go to download his profile and get him to grudgingly sign in. As he signs in he continues to reaffirm that this won't work and its a waste of his time and that Bro2 should be punished. So Bro1 finishes signing in and his profile is back and I do some checks and everything is exactly as he left it. Nothing was deleted.\n\nLong story short, always assume the client (or family member) has no clue what the problem is.",

        "text": "This story takes place many moons ago when I was back home on one of my first breaks from college.  I was the family IT guy and really the only person who knew anything more about a computer than browsing Facebook.\n\nFor some back story, my parents had bought a couple old Compaq laptops (that they always left plugged in...) that they complained about always being slow.  My mother had asked me to do something about it, like what I had done with one of my old computers (which was just installing a light linux distro).\n\nThese machines were now running Ubuntu, with all their commonly used programs in the dock, which basically consisted of Chrome and Solitaire.  It was a simple, easy-to-use setup for them and less hassle on me to maintain.\n\nWhenever I was home, I'd update everything, install any new tools I had learned about, and make sure everything under the hood was hidden from them, so they'd have as painless of an experience as possible.\n\nUntil one day...\n\nI'll be $Me, and dear old mother will be $Mom.\n\n\n$Mom:  $Me, whatever you did broke the computer!\n\n*lolwut.  I haven't done anything to the computer today.*\n\n$Me:  What's it doing?\n\n$Mom:  It's not doing anything.  It's broken.  You need to stay off my computer!\n\n*You say this until you need help googling something again...*\n\n$Me:  Here, let me look at it.\n\n*She shows me the computer.  It's on a screensaver with a digital clock.*\n\n$Me:  That's just a screensaver.  It goes to that when you haven't used it in a bit.\n\n$Mom:  What's that for!?  I don't want it!  You must've installed something and broke it!\n\n$Me:  If you click, it'll go away.  I didn't install anything.  It's just a clock.\n\n$Mom:  What's it do?  I don't want that!\n\n$Me:  It's a clock.  It's just telling you the time.\n\n*I'm really just trying to figure out why this is an issue.*\n\n$Mom:  Why!?  I don't want it.\n\n$Me:  The computer does that automatically after a set time if you haven't used it in awhile.  It keeps people from messing with your computer if you're away.  It's just being friendly and telling you the time.\n\n$Mom:  I don't know what that's for!  What's the clock for?  Uninstall it!\n\n*I'd already began the process of finding the setting to disable screensavers and also questioning my mother's understanding of clocks.*\n\n\nAll in all, a simple fix.  I've got a few more stories as the family IT guy if you all are interested, including the story of my mom having me set up a surround sound on a broken TV and kicking me out.\n",

        "text": "Good afternoon and welcome to my tale of flammable fauna.\n\nA little background first:  I am the repair department (just me!) for a company that manufactures power conversion equipment.  We service everything we sell, from benchtop supplies to megawatt size systems. \n\nOn this particular day, I had arrived at work to find a backlog of units waiting to be evaluated.  Three in particular drew my interest as they were infrequent guests at our power electronics spa.  As I uncrated them, I noticed that there was not a scrap of identifying documentation.  At the very least, there should be a RMA number visible somewhere on the crate, paperwork, and/or unit.  I need this to process the unit(s) into our system and to see what the customer is having trouble with.  Nothing.  Fantastic.\n\nI emailed the responsible parties for more information so that I can process these units and start fixing them.  Part of the information that I requested was any symptoms or fault codes seen by the customer or field service team.  The field service tech responded with the following:\n\n\"Unit has damage to the high voltage busswork from **gecko**.  Power modules need repair and test.\"\n\nWait, *what*?  **Gecko**?  I replied to his email and asked him if that was a typo.  His response was:\n\n\"Nope, no typo.  Look at the high voltage bussing in the back of the module.  You can't miss it!\"\n\nHe had me at gecko.  My interest now fully piqued, I tore the crate open and hefted the unit on top of another crate.  Sure enough, there was a carbon outline of a gecko, surrounded by scorched and pitted copper.  The unit came from Hawaii where these critters are everywhere, apparently.  This little insurance spokeslizard decided he needed a little pick-me-up and took a stroll across the insulation separating the positive and negative plates, effectively shorting 1100VDC with his moist limbs.  Poof!  No more saving 15% or more!\n\n**TL;DR:**  Little lizard seeking excitement vaporizes on contact with high voltage.",

She said thanks in a reply.\n\n\nThen I get another email from her.

        "text": "I've been a lurker here since 2015, but since I was in college at the time, I never had any particularly interesting tech support stories. Fast forward to the end of December 2017 and I'm looking for a job — Java or web development. I get a call from $HelpfulJobAgency with an interesting offer, one I don't regret taking, even if that was the day things started getting weird. \n\nSee, $HJA doesn't take your money; instead, they fly you out to their campus, train you in a 10-week boot-camp the different technologies companies use that you don't usually pick ip in college, pay you minimum wage, and then sell you with a two year contract to another company. It's a nice deal, and I picked up a certificate along the way.\n\nThe problem started day one, when I was assigned to the group that would be learning Pega — a Java-based BPM suite. I'd never heard of it before, but neither had anyone else in my class, so I wasn't too worried. I was just a little mad that I'd interviewed to be a Java developer and was put there instead, but I got over it quickly. \n\nThe weeks go by, and training is hard. Pega is very different from any other programming language, and there were parts to it I struggled to pick up on; no big deal, I could study on my own or learn on the job. (I'd later regret thinking that; Pega is very starved in terms of help documentation and my future job... we'll get to that.) Eventually, I'm contacted by $InternationalTechCompany through $HJA for a developer interview. \n\nWhile waiting to hear back from them, $HJA sets me up with several other interviewers, including another department of $ITC, all for developer positions. I don't get a choice in where I go, though; whichever one accepts me first is the one I'm contractually obligated to go to. I think little of this, but I'm starting to get a little nervous abour how vague these positions are. By this point there's been several other communication issues, but they generally got resolved for the best in the end. I trusted that this would be the same. \n\nAnd so, about a month and a half ago, I was hired. But, besides being labeled an \"associate,\" I had no idea where I'd be going or what I'd be doing, besides \"Pega work in the USA.\"\n\nA week in onboarding/on bench finally sees me transferred to my new position. And there, I *finally* get an answer to the specifics of my job:\n\nTech support. \n\nI'm not mad. Honestly, the pay's pretty good and it's challenging work, but I have no fucking clue how I got here. No part of this career path was in my control after day one. But since I'm here, well...\n\nI guess I can start sharing my own tales from tech support. 🙂",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/971gnn/beware_of_sysadmins_carrying_oxyacetylene_torches/",
        "text": "I'm sure you've all heard the expression \"Beware of programmers carrying screwdrivers\", right? Well... this is just a tiny bit different. \n\nAs a sysadmin on a ship, I was responsible for many things... The network as a whole, our internet connection, phones, servers, PC's, Ipods... You name it. Further, I was responsible for the various sensors that allowed our systems to work. I was also the resident multibeam sonar expert. So... one day... I'm called down to the survey lab because our two YSI probes are showing different values. YSI probes measure salinity and temperature so that we can get an accurate measurement of the speed of sound through the water at the surface ( critical for accurate multibeam data ). Now, these can be calibrated on the fly, but no matter what we do, one is obviously WAY off. These probes are mounted in a \"sea chest\" in the engine room. A sea chest is just a piece of pipe teed off of the inlet for cooling water or desalination, or whatever. \n\nSo, I grab a fellow sysadmin and head down to the engine room.  Along the way, I pass the Chief Engineer who sees us each grab a set of earmuffs and head into the engine room. Now, he's seen various survey crew head into the engine room to check on various pieces of our equipment, but he's never seen the \"computer guys\" head into the engine room, and I guess this sparks his curiosity.  We emerge a couple of minutes later and head upstairs only to return almost immediately with a couple of wrenches and a ratchet. Again, we disappear into the engine room. About 15 minutes later, we emerge and head upstairs and return within a minute or so with an impact wrench. This time he hears about 15-20 minutes worth of impact wrench noise, before we both emerge yet again, dripping with sweat. I ask him if we can use his oxy-acetylene torch and he hesitantly agrees, but follows us to see what we're up to. I open the valves on the oxygen and acetylene bottles and coil up about 40 feet of hose on my should and grab the torch, a sparker, and a set of goggles. We approach the sea chest and explain that the bolts holding it close are frozen and that we're going to heat them up to break them loose. He eyes us rather skeptically and starts to ask if I really know how to operate a torch. At which point I crack the acetylene valve open on the torch head, hit the sparker, and turn on the oxygen until I get a blue flame. I hit the oxygen handle a couple of times and smile in what I hope is a reassuring manner. He's still watching with some trepidation as we heat up each nut and my fellow sysadmin attacks the corresponding bolt with the impact wrench. Within a few minutes we have all 8 bolts off and we swap out the barnacle encrusted sensor probes with fresh new ones and get the sea chest bolted back together. I put the torch back where it belong and the engineer follows us out muttering something about the world coming to an end when the computer guys can handle a torch. LOL \n\nWe were able to get the new sensors calibrated and were back to work in probably 2 hours. This was not the first or only time that I saw someone completely shocked that a \"computer guy\" had skills outside of computers. ",

Solving a customer's problems can be somewhat fun and enjoyable, *if the customer can listen to simple instructions, that is.*\n\nI'm currently doing an apprenticeship at a company that develops, sells and supports software for POS systems and ware house management, along with software for creating reports and, important to my story, software to be used on small mobile computers (Datalogic Memor X3 are one model we use).\n  \n\\--  \n\n**Today's events**\n\nI'm currently a part of our first level support hotline, the first place customers call when they experience a problem or have a question about one of our products' features, as they can be quite complicated even for experienced users. The following is a write up of 3 calls I had in the span of about half an hour, all by the same customer. \n  \n\\--\n  \n$Me = That one dude from that one movie  \n$C = Customer who doesn't quite know what words being said through the phone mean.  \n$Co = Coworker who I share an office with.  \nMDE = What we call the devices, short for Mobile Data Entry.\n  \n\\--\n  \n*Call one, $C has called twice before about the same issue*\n\n&gt;$Me: \"[Company name], $Me speaking, good morning.\"\n\n\n&gt;$C: \"[Customer's company], $C speaking. Every time I scan an article for stocktaking purposes, our MDE device gives us the error \"EAN not found in database\". Can you assist us?\"  \n\n\nAt this point my colleague looks at me in a \"are you kidding me\" manner, as he took both of the previous calls of $C. He motions for me to mute my microphone.  \n\n&gt;$Co: \"If this is actually $C, ask her if she removed the device from the dock.\"\n\n*So I ask her.*\n\nShe removed it. Because apparently, the computer screen reading \"sending files\" means that you can remove the device from the dock that connects it to the computer. $Co is not very amused and tells me to tell $C to re-insert the device, and wait until we call her back before removing the device again. She agrees and thanks us for our assistance.\n\nThe database, which has to be moved from the POS system to the MDE device can take a while to transfer. For her setup, it was about 15 minutes of transferring the files along with 5 minutes of waiting afterwards for the MDE device to import the database into our software.\n\n*End of call one*\n\n\\--\n\n*Act two, five minutes later*\n\n&gt;$C calls. $Co groans. Several other people can be heard groaning as they had dealt with the same thing last time that customer took stock, exactly a year ago.\n\n*So I answer the phone.*\n\n&gt;$Me: \"[Company name], $Me speaking, good morning.\"\n\n\n&gt;$C: \"[Customer's company], $C speaking. I think we just talked? A co-worker told me to just close the error message and continue working, but all I can see is some kinda background and the software isn't there.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Did you remove the device from the dock?\"  \n\nI wouldn't be typing this if she hadn't. She removed it.\n\n$Co groans again as he already knew what $C would answer to my question.  So we repeat the whole spiel of getting her to put the device back in, restarting the database transfer, and telling her to keep her fingers off the device until we call her. To our surprise, she actually let the transfer finish before calling back the next time.\n\n*End of act two*\n\n\\--\n\n*Episode III, about twenty minutes after the last call*  \n\n&gt;$C calls once again. I answer once again. At this point, $Co is getting really annoyed.  \n\n&gt;$Me: \"[Company name], $Me speaking, good morning.\"\n\n&gt;$C: \"[Customer's company], $C speaking once again. The transfer seems to have finished, can I remove the device and use it now?\"  \n\n&gt;$Me: \"Just let me check if the files have been imported into the software yet to make sure it will work once you scan an article.\"\n\nI check. The files were transferred and imported. I open the software on the MDE device (there's an application that lets us control the device from the PC as long as it's connected to the dock). $C is happy, I am happy. \n\n*It would not stay this way for long.*\n\n*End of Episode III*  \n\n\\--\n\n*Part 3.0 + 1.0, a call which I did not answer but $Co did.*\n\n$Co was getting agitated and wanted to get done with this customer for today. So he answered the call.\n\n&gt;$Co: \"[Company name], $Co speaking, good morning.\"\n\n&gt;$C: \"[Customer's company], $C speaking once again. I tried scanning an article on one of the other MDE devices, but they gave the same error message as the one I've called about before.\"\n\n$Co looks like he saw someone kick a puppy. He remains calm and explains to her that we'll have to transfer the database to the two other devices as well, as she probably removed the devices before the database was fully transferred and imported into the software on the MDE.\n\nThe call ends, $Co looks defeated. $C doesn't call back.  \n\n*End of Part 3.0 + 1.0*\n\n\\--\n\nNow, this wouldn't be fun if she didn't call again, would it? And of course, I take the call, because I'm the apprentice and the others are very obviously annoyed.\n\nWhat follows is the explanation that no, *we can't do every single thing she needs to do on our software for her stocktaking to finish.*   \nI manage to do what no other of my coworkers was able to do without proper knowledge on how the stocktaking works on our system: I can sell her stocktaking assistance for 2 hours on the following day, explaining to her how the things she has to do during stocktaking are described in the software's manual, and if she'd rather have someone from our company assist her during it, she'd have to pay for that as it's not part of the money she pays to have support (which is meant for problems with our software or questions, but not ~15 calls over 3 days about her not knowing how to do stocktaking after having done it for a few years already, with her citing that she doesn't need to remember as she can just call us). For some reason, that clicked with $C (she was told this multiple times before and did not accept it).  \n$Co congratulates me and hands over our \"supporter of the week\" medal (a cheap metal medal with a piece of paper taped onto it saying \"supporter of the week\") and $C did not call back anymore.\n\n*Now to wait until tomorrow, to see what disasters $C will unleash unto poor $Co, who has volunteered to help her. Bless his soul.*",

        "text": "Hopefully, you guys don't mind me jumping around in time. I'm afraid I don't remember stories in chronological order. For the first few stories, we are back at the bank. Eventually, I will post stories from my other jobs.\n\nThe following three mini stories all happened in the same week. Three different branches called in more or less the exact same problem. \n\n1) \n\n$me: Helpdesk, this is $me. How can I help you?\n\n$teller: We can't turn our MICR printer on. \n\n$me: Okay, can you verify that the power cable is plugged firmly into the printer?\n\n$teller: It is.\n\n$me: Okay, is the other end plugged into the wall or into a power strip? \n\n$teller: It's plugged into a power strip.\n\n$me, Is the power strip turned on? \n\n$teller: Yes, yes, and the power strip is plugged into the wall. \n\n$me: Okay, what happens when you flip the power switch? \n\n$teller: Nothing at all, no lights, nothing. \n\n$me: Hmm... Okay, can you plug a fan or lamp or something into the power strip to make sure that you have power? \n\n$teller: I can plug my phone charger in... and it's charging my phone? \n\n$me: Well, as unlikely as it seems, I guess you have a dead printer. I'll send someone out to take a look. \n\nThe next day I get an email from the contract tech that the power cable was barely hanging out of the printer. All he had to do was plug it all the way in. I got fussed at by my boss for sending a contract tech out to plug in a power cable... \n\n\\---\n\n2)\n\nA day or two after this incident, with the scolding fresh in my mind. Another branch calls in. \n\n$me: Helpdesk, this is $me, how can I help you?\n\n$teller: Our network printer won't come on. \n\n$me(internal): Not again?!\n\n$me: Can you verify that the power cable is plugged into the printer?\n\n$teller: It is. \n\n$me: please unplug the power cable and jam it back in as hard as you can. \n\n$teller: Okay, I've done that. \n\n$me: Is it plugged directly into the wall or into a power strip? \n\n$teller: It's plugged into the wall. \n\n$me: Can you unplug it and plug it back in as hard as you can?\n\n$teller: Okay, now what? \n\n$me: Please try to turn the printer off then on again.\n\n$teller: Still nothing. \n\n$me: Can you make sure that the outlet has power by plugging in a fan or lamp or something? \n\n$teller: Okay. It has power. \n\n$me: Okay, I guess you have a dead printer. I will send someone out. \n\nThe next day I get an email from the tech that the outlet had no power because a breaker had tripped. He reset the breaker and everything worked. Again, I was scolded for sending a tech out to flip a breaker. \n\n\\---\n\n3) A day or two following the most recent incident, yet another branch calls in saying that their printer won't come on. My boss's office is literally feet from my cubicle. By the time I finish the call, he is literally in tears. \n\n$me: Helpdesk, this is $me, how can I help you?\n\n$teller: Our printer won't come on. \n\n$me: You aren't fooling me this time... \n\n$teller: I'm sorry, I didn't hear that .What did you say? \n\n$me: Oh nothing... Can you verify that the power cable is plugged into the printer? \n\n$teller: It is. \n\n$me: Please pull the power cord out and jam it back in as hard as you can. \n\n$teller: Are you sure? \n\n$me: YES\n\n$teller: Okay, done, now what? \n\n$me: Is the other end plugged into the wall or a power strip? \n\n$teller: It's plugged into a power strip. \n\n$me: please unplug it and jam the plug back into the power strip as hard as you can. \n\n$teller: Okay...\n\n$me: Now, is the power switch glowing red on the power strip? \n\n$teller: No\n\n$me: Okay, make sure the power strip is plugged into the wall, then unplug it and ram it back into the outlet as hard as you can. Then tell me if the light came on. \n\n$teller: ... uh.. no, the light is still off...\n\n$me: Please flip the switch on the power strip. \n\n$teller: It's on now. \n\n$me: please plug a fan or radio into the power strip so that I can hear that it has power. \n\n$teller: Okay, can you hear it? \n\n$me: Yes, I can confirm that you have power .\n\n$me: please try to turn the printer on again\n\n$teller: It's still not working. \n\n$me(internal): @#$%#!!!!\n\n$me: Okay, I will send out a technician. \n\nThe next day, I get an email from the contract tech that the printer had a faulty power switch. \n\n$boss: You deserve an attaboy for that last printer. You were exceedingly thorough, and we definitely needed to send a tech out. Also, I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in my life!\n\n\\---\n\nOkay, still at the bank for this one... Rather than a conversation style, this will be more of a story. \n\nOne day, one of our mortgage branches calls in and says \"Nobody but Mary can print.\". Huh, that's a bit weird. I call in and speak to several people ( the entire office is 8 people ). They have access to the internet, they can see other machine, but they can't print. Mary can print just fine. The printer ( a Toshiba copier ) is accessible through the web interface and is not reporting any errors. Just for fun, I share the printer from Mary's PC and map the printer through Mary's PC on a user's machine. She is then able to print just fine. We power cycle the printer, and still nobody can print. We map everybody through Mary's PC but leave the original printer just in case. We attempt to research the issue. We find NOTHING. A few days later, the same branch calls back. Now Mary can't print, but one of the others can. Again, that person is the ONLY person who can print. We try various things including rebooting pretty much every piece of equipment in the office. Everyone has internet access as well as intranet... We again escalate the problem to network infrastructure, and again, they find nothing. We map everyone through that person's PC and everybody can print that way. About two weeks later, another branch calls with the exact same issue... on the other side of the country. By the end, we had about 5 branch locations calling every month or so with the same story. We never did find a cause, reason, or good solution. \n\n\\---\n\nAnd my last printer story for today. This time, this is a story from my time working for City Hall. \n\n$me: Helpdesk, this is $me, how can I help you?\n\n$user: I can't print. \n\n$me: Okay, what happens when you try to print? \n\n$user: Nothing!\n\n$me: \\*sigh\\* That doesn't really tell me anything. Do you get an error message? \n\n$user: No, just nothing comes out of the printer. I don't have time to do this on the phone, could you just come up here? \n\n$me: OKay, I'll be up shortly. \n\nSo... I go upstairs and into the accounting cubicle farm. There are three cubicle in a row against the wall, each with only 3 sides. User is in the last cubicle. I ask her which printer she's having problems with and she literally turns her chair around and points to a printer TEN FEET away. Without taking a single step towards the printer, I immediately see the problem. There's a red blinking light on the printer. As I approach, I see the dreaded error message: Please load letter. User had sent the same print job 43 times... each time it didn't print, she would angrily send the print job again. I informed the user that the printer was out of paper, that she should perhaps put paper in it, and that she should verify that the printer has paper before sending 42 more print jobs and certainly before she calls the helpdesk. \\*sigh\\* Users... \n\nTL;DR: Users lie and printers are evil.",

The following events began:\n\n$HC: \"We have a register down on front end and it's critical we have it back up today!\"\n$Me: \"Sure, let's go take a look at it.\"\n\n$HC escorts me to aforementioned register.\n\n$Me: \"Ok. So what's the issue?\"\n$HC: \"It just doesn't work.\"\n$Me: \"What is it specifically doing or not doing?\"\n$HC: \"It's just not doing anything! Fix it!x\n\nSo, I began my troubleshooting. After about 30 seconds, I discovered the issue lied inside the cash drawer. Specifically, the Ethernet port that connects to the docking bay inside the terminal. It was busted to the point I had to dig it out of the register in 4 pieces.\n\n$Me: *Showing the issue* \"I'll have to order this part.

These things don't just sort of implode by themselves...\"\n$HC: \"Well, it stopped working over the weekend and I called the help desk. They said to check that cable that went into the cash drawer. It was a little loose and they said it needed to be pushed in securely. So I gave it a tap to make sure.\"\n$Me: \"... What'd you tap it with?\"\n$HC: \"I found a rubber mallet in the cupboard so I used it to help me. But the help desk told me to make sure it's secure! It's their fault!\"\n$Me: \"Please, from now on, simply just press down and wait for a click of the tab locking into place. If you still can't get it working, I'm here once per week and I'll be glad to look at it.\"\n\nTL;DR Head Cashier pulverised an Ethernet port with a rubber mallet because the register was too \"Critical\" to have down.",

        "text": "The company I worked for when I worked offshore left me with many, many stories. Some amusing, some exciting, many just worthy of a head shake. This collection of very very brief anecdotes are about spending money...\n\n\\--\n\nWhen I was working in Key West, we were having trouble performing a patch test ( calibration ) for out multibeam system. I had done MANY patch tests in the past and was one of the go to people to do one. This particular system was kicking my butt. None of the calibration answers made ANY sense. So, they send out one of the senior programmers who is even more experienced and we collectively scratch our heads for several hours. We've tested just about everything we can test, and nothing makes any sense. Finally, the programmer asks us to put the boat on the trailer and leave it parked in a parking lot. We collect motion sensor and gps data from all sensors for a few hours and notice that the motion sensor thinks that we are in heavy seas... positions are all over the place. We call the office and rather than calling the vendor to fix the unit, they call one of our sales people at a trade show and get them to pick up the DEMO unit that $squid was using to show off there new position sensor. Sales person buys the demo unit on the spot for $70,000, drives it to an airport, and buys a plane ticket for the motion sensor. We had it in about 5 hours. Did I mention that the other motion sensor was under warranty? Or that I had requested and been denied a replacement keyboard for the data collection computer on the boat?\n\n\\--\n\nI was invited to take part in setting up a seismic boat for the company. We had just bought a 2 million dollar streamer cable ( hydrophones ) and a collection system. We also bought training for about a dozen of us and invested in all sorts of new hardware, including  a pair of GI guns as sound sources and a 4,000 PSI air compressor. When we asked for chaffing gear to protect the 2 million dollar cable ( probably would have cost us about $2,000 ) we were denied. We ended up getting a couple of old fire hoses from a fire department and a few hundred dollars worth of tape and making our own... 12 people working for 2 days to make it...\n\n\\--\n\nOne of the boats I worked on had hull mounted sensors as well as an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle ( worth about 4 million dollars, and we charged $100,00 per day to run it ). I was tasked with setting up an additional multibeam system that would be mounted to a pole ( high resolution, high frequency ). We get to the boat, and we are missing the screws to mount the transducer to the pole. It's 11pm on a Saturday night. The nearest fastener store has been closed since Friday at 5pm. I called my boss to tell him the bad news. My boss calls around until he finds the store manager. Store manager says he won't open the store unless the order is more than $2,000. We needed about $100 worth of bolts. We paid $2000 for those bolts. We had the bolts at the office, but it would have taken 4 hours to get them to us, plus time to install them. Having the guy open the store probably saved us around $14,000.... My boss was very happy that we weren't delayed at $4,000 an hour... The store manager was thrilled to get a nearly $2000 bonus. Everybody wins!\n\n\\--\n\n\\--\n\n I was sent to Japan to help mobilize a new ( to us ) boat. One of my fellow techs and I were busying ourselves setting up the various computers in the lab. The boat, for the record, was a Russian boat. We got the workstations and servers all set up and we were moving to the various PC's. My fellow technician forgot that Russian power is 200V @ 50Hz and possibly also forgot about the little red switch on the back of the power supply to switch it from 110 to 220. We \\*ALWAYS\\* had spares for everything, so this was not seen as a disaster... until one of the surveyors decided to help us plug in machines. Poof! Two machines up in smoke. We called the office and they flew someone from the US with $10k in cash to get replacement machines. This was a nightmare in and of itself.\n\nOur credit cards did not work in Japan at this time. We had $10k in US currency, which no shop would take. The only money changer we could find was a bank. The bank was EXTREMELY suspicious of 6 Americans trying to change $10k. They limited us to $1k per person per day and they insisted on inspected each bill individually... in great detail. So, we managed to get $6k exchanged. Which turned out to be exactly enough to buy two of the cheapest machines we could get our hands on. Which were running Windows ME... In Japanese... I had to get the client rep to walk me through getting it set up enough to change languages. Those two machines died about 4 months later...",

        "text": "This tale features one dizzy techie ($Me), the lovely client ($Client) and a hoarde of iMacs in a tried-and-tested network.    \n\n#      Prologue    \n\n  \nI contract for $Client since a few years ago (remote and on-site IT  support and maintenance). The person who contracted before me left me  with an Apple Notes database of passwords and random setup checklists  and troubleshooting tips, but no documentation of the network configuration at all.      \nFor remote management and support all of  the computers (90% Apple) are signed into the same Apple ID and use  „Back To My Mac” for VNC &amp; Management. This has worked okay for a  few years but is unreliable since the $Client's ISP switched them from  native IPv4 to IPv6. So it's time to look for a new solution. A VPN + DDNS combo should suffice - once I'm connected to the local Mac server I can connect to the local computers and manage everything through VNC.  After testing a Synology RT1900AC Wi-Fi router at home I found it works  perfectly for this setup (Synolgoy provides DDNS service and SSL VPN  server &amp; client apps). So I call $Client and have them order a  RT1900AC.    \n\n# Chapter 1: the plan    \n\n  \nBecause they need  working network during business hours, I arrive at $Client at 8:30 in  the evening. All staff have left, so I can roam free and start to look  at the network configuration. There have never been any major network  issues since I contract with them, so I haven't looked at the setup closely yet. I find four Ethernet switches, four WiFi routers as well as  two internet modems and one phone modem. It seems there are two  internet connections running parallel into a modem and router each and  then meet in a rack-mounted router with two WAN ports. Digging through the Notes, I find login info for the rack router and discover it's configured to manage WAN failover (the new router also supports this).  \nProperly  documenting the network took me over an hour due to horrible web  interface of the different routers and modems and multiple WiFi networks  with random devices around the building connecting to different ones. There was even a digital camera on its own network. Next, I tried to set  up the new Synology router as Wireless Access point to replace the rack  router. I decided to keep the rack router for the day because I was running late and decided to simply add the Synology in between the main DSL router and the rack router to test the remote access features, with  no change to the rest of the network. Both DDNS and remote access worked  right away and I tested the connection stability using one of the  iMacs. For this I had to disconnect it from Ethernet and connect to my  smartphone Hotspot to get outside the network. I was able to access the  router via remote management website, all is well and after making sure I  reset to internal network access, I went home (very late). I decided to  leave my phone on during the night. That way in case something broke, the $Client could reach me in the morning.    \n\n# Chapter 2: the call\n\n  \nNext morning at 7:30 am, my phone rings me out of bed.      \n$Me, super sleepy: \"Helluh?\"      \n$Client: \"Hi $Me. Please you have to help the computers are not working I can't use this how can I get it working please help\"      \n$Me, startled: \"Slow down please whoa, what is not working?\"      \n$Client:  \"The computer is not working. Try to put my name and password and it  doesn't work. Nothing is working. I have restarted it three times  already. Did you change something last night?\"      \n$Me: \"Well I  did install the new router for testing, but the computers haven't  changed in any way. Can you describe what you see on the computer?\"      \n$Client: \"There's this screen where I put my name.\" ($Client is trying to say login screen)      \n$Me: \"Okay. Is there something unusual?\"      \n$Client: \"There's a little red light on it.\"      \n$Me faintly remembers there is a red light on the login screen when the Mac server is unreachable.      \n$Me: \"Can you click the red light and tell me what it says?\"      \n$Client: \"Network accounts unavailable\"      \n$Me  thinks through the options. Option 1: server crashed and failed to  restart. Severity maximum, likelihood minimum but has happened before.  Option 2: iMac is broken. Severity medium, likelyhood minimum (I tested  the internal login just before leaving in the night before). Option 3:  new Wifi router stopped working or causes network issues. Severity  maximum, likelyhood medium. I choose option 3.      \n$Me talks  $Client through disconnecting the new router to restore the exact  previous state of the network. Thankfully the old router is red and the  new one is black. (\"do you see the grey cable? yes there are two. No  they are not the same. You need to unplug the left one. Did you unplug  the left one?\")      \nFinally, it seems like $Client managed to re-plug two ethernet cables. Whew. Let's see if iMac is happy.      \n$Client: \"I've rebooted the iMac again and the red light is still here. What do we do?\"      \nStill  sleepy and dizzy, I try to remember what I did to the poor iMac that  could make it stop working. I remember the Wifi Hotspot test and a  suspicion arises: could the iMac still be on WiFi, possibly on an  incorrect network?      \n$Me: \"Can you check if the iMac is on WiFi?\"      \n$Client: \"The mac is what? Wifi?\"      \n$Me  headdesk: \"Look at the time on the mac. At the top of the screen. Next  to it on the left is there a little symbol like a radar?\"      \n$Client: \"I can see a litte wavy symbol like on my phone there, yes. It's  connected. That's good, right? I don't get it. All the other computers  are working.\"      \n$Me pauses. Didn't $Client tell me in the  beginning that all of them were not working? Did I spend the last ten  minutes on the phone for nothing? Anyway.       \n$Me: \"That's not supposed to be there. We need to turn that off.\"      \nThe  problem: it's AFAIK not possible to change the network configuration  from macOS login screen. I'll have to let $Client login with the local  admin account to change that.      \n$Me talks $Client through logging in as admin and changing the network settings.       \n(...excerpt from the call:) $Client: \"What do I click?\"      \n$Me: \"Make active and then click Apply.\"      \n$Client: \"Make active. Okay. Now it says unknown state. See it's not working I told you.\"      \n$Me: \"Did you click apply at the bottom right?\"      \n$Client: \"Uh.. hold up the customer phone is ringing.\"      \n$Me: \"We are literally a single click away from done.\"      \n$Client:  \"I'm answering the other phone, one moment. (talking into other phone)  Yes. No I can't look that up right now there's a problem with the  computer. Can I call you back? I don't know. Thanks for understanding.  Bye. (talking to $Me again) Let's fix it quick now! Please!\" (...)      \nTurns out I forgot to change back to Ethernet in the evening. The iMac was  set to the internal $Client WiFi, which would have been fine. But the WiFi is not set to reconnect automatically and I had put the iMac to  sleep when I left. Duh-duh. In the morning when $Client woke up the  iMac, it connected to the guest wifi network for some reason, making the  server and network accounts unavailable. In the end, it got fixed and  we had unnessarily disconnected the new router, which had been working perfectly fine.    \n\n# Chapter 3: the fall\n\n  \nThe  same evening I stop by the $Client to reconnect the WiFi router. I'm a  little bit early so there's some $Client staff left. I ask if they need  internet for the next few minutes, they say no, I swap the ethernet  cable back around.      \n$Client: \"The SMS sending service is not working.\"      \n$Me: \"That uses the internet. It'll start working in a minute or so.\"      \nEnter  $Boss. He manages the $Client business and is generally a nice guy.  Though his expectations and ideas are usually wildly exaggerated.      \n$Boss: \"Hey $Me what's up? The internet isn't working!\"      \n$Me:  \"Nice to see you, too.\" I spy the router LEDs are signaling online, and  check my phone. Guest Wifi is back online. \"It's working for me, just  finished installing the new router.\"      \n$Boss: \"Nice.\"      \n$Client: \"Sorry but it stopped working again. Can you take a look?\"      \n$Me, puzzeled, refreshes website on phone. Indeed not loading.      \n$Me: \"Seems like we have an issue there.\"      \n$Boss: \"Good job!\" and leaves with $Client.      \n$Me burns $Boss's back with death stare and digs through the network again.  I connect the iMac to the rack router management WiFi because the  ethernet isn't getting an IP anymore. Some cursing about the awful web  interface later, I end up on the WAN failover settings page that I had  looked at the night before. It's changed and auto-detected the IP of the  new router as gateway for WAN 1, which it is NOT supposed to be! The  old router/modem is still the gateway. I change it back and it resumes  working, so I pack to leave and decide to check Twitter while I'm still  on WiFi. A few tweets download fine and then the connection drops out  again. In anger, I re-login to rack router management. The IP for WAN1  gateway has changed back to the new router. What the heck. I decide to disable WAN failover entirely, which solves the issue.\n\n# TLDR:\n\n  \nUndocumented, needlessly complicated network setup leads to unforeseeable issues when  installing a new WiFi router. $Me gets to work extra long hours to  figure sh\\*t out and earns a sarcastic \"Good job\" from $Boss.  \n​",

        "text": "So, this will be a little different than previous posts. This is a small collection of very short stories involving sending data to/from ships at sea. These stories data from the early 2000's and involve data connections as fast as 64kbps ( just slightly faster than a 56k modem ) to as low as 2400 baud.\n\nAll of our boats had email capabilities, but it was severely restricted. This was our only form of communication other than making cell/satellite phone calls. Satellite phones calls were costing us roughly $5 per minute regardless of whether it was a phone or data call. Roaming charges for the analog cell phones in the Gulf of Mexico were around $2-$3 per minute.\n\nEmails were generally text only with no attachments. There were some attachments that were approved, but for most you had to get special permission or know how to bypass the system. The method that was used for bypassing the filters involved putting a special header in your email, which could be tracked.\n\nFor our first story, we are working in the Gulf of Mexico and we need a wiring diagram or instructions on how to wire a connector to a singlebeam transducer ( fathometer ). There were 4 pins. This could have been as simple as a quick text email saying that pin1 was clockwise from the index pin and pin1 is transmit, etc. Instead, on of the less technical people at the office decides to email us a diagram. As I recall, it took us 6 hours to receive the email. Remember, this email cost us $2-$3 per MINUTE. Not only that, but for those 6 hours, we were unable to work, costing us probably another $5,000 or so. When we FINALLY received the email, we figured out why it took so long. The user took a page from a manual, scanned it in from a network fax machine as a type 3 TIFF, then imported that TIFF into a word document, then attached that word document to an email. The results file was several megabytes. If he had scanned the file as a jpeg and attached that to his email, it probably would have been less than 10k.\n\nFor the next story... The people that were sent to demob ( take all of our equipment off ) a boat were generally not the same people sent to mobilize a boat. The demob crew just had to disconnect everything and get it boxed up to send back to the office. They generally didn't know or care what cable went to what, they just pulled it all down and packaged it neatly for shipment. I'm working off the coast of Singapore when I am awakened by someone telling me that I have a phone call ( extremely rare, generally some sort of emergency ). So, I haul ass downstairs to see what's worth calling me at $5 per minute. The person on the other side is a sysadmin trainee that I've worked with a few times and he's obviously panicked. He got sent out with the demob crew to shut down one of our ships. When they were about halfway through tearing everything out, they got a call that there was a job for that ship and to put everything back. They had no idea how to do that, so I spent the next 3 hours trying to walk them through setting up machines blindly over a satellite phone call with 2-3 second latency. So... 3 hours == 180 minutes x 2 because the call was from a sat phone TO a sat phone and you see that this one phone call was about $3,600. We managed to get them set back up to go back to work. Generally the management at the office would lose their minds over a $15 minute phone call... I guess a $3,600 phone call was cheaper than losing the job or flying someone out to help them get set up. LOL\n\nThe last story of these for now ( I'm sure I'll think of more ), is even more expensive. Again, this was 2000 or 2001. We generally did not have antivirus software on our computers offshore. The computers were isolated, so it generally wasn't a problem. I'm assuming one of our client reps had a cd or thumb drive that was infected and tried to read that data on one of our CAD machines. We not only didn't have the software on our computers, we didn't have a copy of any antivirus to install. Cue the following phone call to the office.\n\n$me: (calls my boss at the office)\n\n$boss; Hey $me, what's up?\n\n$me: The CAD machine has a virus. We need antivirus software to clean it.\n\n$boss: That sounds bad, can you pull a spare machine to replace it?\n\n$me: yes, but I don't know how many more machines are infected or what the source of the infection is.\n\n$boss: oh crap, I didn't think of that. Let me hand you over to our IT guys\n\n$me: ok\n\n$IT: We can't send you our antivirus software, it would take several hours and cost thousands of dollars\n\n$me: I have at least one machine with a virus. If TWO CAD machines get this virus, we won't be able to make maps. If the virus spreads to a data collection machine, we won't be able to work at all. This is a multimillion dollar project.\n\n$IT: How close are you to land? Can you head into port?\n\n$me: We are 200 miles out. It would take us a full day to get to port and a full day to get back to the jobsite, plus whatever time it takes us to find a copy of this software in a store.\n\n$IT: The project manager could get a copy and helicopter it out to you?\n\n$me: We are heading away from Singapore. by the time the project manager got a copy and hired a helicopter, we would be out of helicopter range.\n\n$IT: \\*sigh\\* Fine. I'll talk to management about how much this will cost and why it's necessary.\n\n$me: THANK YOU!\n\nEnd result? It took 20ish hours to get the antivirus software. 20\\*60=1200.  1200\\*5=$6,000.  We were able to get all the  PC's on the boat scanned and protected within a day. Map making was delayed for about a day. The only other machine that was affected was the client rep's laptop.",

        "text": "My last day as a call center technician ended yesterday. I got a promotion where I will be writing technical documents instead of handling customers. I had no idea what to expect from my last call, but I felt it was such a fitting representation of being a tech that I figured it would be meaningful to share.\n\n**STORY:**\n\nIt's exactly 15 minutes until I clock out before I get a call from a tablet. 99% of the time these calls are from toddlers that are just mashing buttons. Usually you get a couple of seconds of noise in the background and then the call drops.\n\nThis was the first time in two months that I ask for a name and through the static I can hear someone on the other end actually trying to communicate. I go from thinking that my last call is just going to be a dropped call to one where I can barely make out his name or his number, but somehow through the noise I figure out that he had lost his phone after leaving it on top of his car and had called us a few minutes prior to try to locate it for him.\n\nAfter getting his information pulled up, the notes tell me that the previous technician had called his lost phone and a woman picked up on the other end saying that she was willing to drive to the customer's home and give his phone to him. But the call dropped before the tech could connect them because they tried to conference a tablet with a phone line, which they should've known isn't feasible on most tablets. After that the customer called in again to get help with communicating again since it's impossible for us to call tablets back.\n\nIn the time being I learn the customer has a lot on his plate, being in the middle of a divorce he's been forgetful. I empathize with him, and we both agree that he's exceptionally lucky that someone nice had retrieved his phone.\n\nHe explained that he had no other way to communicate other than the tablet. With that known, I call his phone and speak with the woman that found it. Usually I'm not allowed to share customer information but it was my last day, I had his consent, and they weren't going to monitor my call anyway.  I manage to keep them both on the line long enough to get them to add each other on Facebook.  It was pretty liberating applying common sense over policy for once.\n\nAfter that they were confident handling it on their own. I proceeded to disconnect from my system, clock out, and I took a minute to reflect on how perfect of a last call this was. By no means is it the craziest story here, but I felt that this story perfectly illustrates how completely random every call has the potential to be. They train you as much as possible, but every day there is always a one off that takes you completely off the rails of a conventional call. That's what this call basically was.\n\n**TL;DR:** Man lost his phone, called tech support through a tablet to help him call the person that found his phone so that they can exchange Facebook information and get his phone back from her.",

        "text": "So... This is yet another tale of offshore sysadminning. In this case, I'm working on a seismic job. We run 20-30 lines per day, 24 hours a day. We are headed to the dock because of weather or needing parts or SOMETHING... My main jobs for this project are processing bathymetry data and making sure that ALL the data gets backed up to tape. I'm done with my part when I see our geophysicist sitting at his computer with a couple of pages stapled together laboriously typing out commands. I go over to chat. \n\nHe tells me that he's several days behind. That he can only process 5 or 6 lines of data in a day and we are collecting 20-30 lines per day. I ask him if I can see his instructions and I realize that he is telnetted into my Unix machine running commands. Running commands typed exactly the same way in exactly the same order for every line. Probably about 10 commands. He does this for EVERY line. \n\nI ask him if I can borrow his sheet for a few minutes. He agrees, and I wander off to create a simple shell script that runs each of the commands in sequence and takes a line number or wildcard as input. That way, he can simply run \"Process \\*\" and process ALL the lines at once. His mind is blown and within a few hours he's completely caught up. \n\nThe next day, he asks if I can make a few changes... make it easier for him to pull up graphs, clean up intermediate files that are not needed, etc. I agree, and make those changes. This progresses/evolves over the next few weeks into a handful of individual scripts... one to process data, one just to view graphs, another to isolate traces, etc. It becomes a very handy toolbox for him, and basically adds nothing to my own responsibilities, so we are both happy. A couple of months go by and I desperately need to get off the boat for some time off. There are no other admins to take my place, so they send a programmer out and I get about 2 hours with him to cover everything he needs to know... He compliments me on giving him ALL the information that he needs, in spite of the rambling, stream of consciousness style of our meeting. While he was there, he took my collection of scripts and wrote a GUI around them. Now, instead of using wildcards, there's a file selection tool, and various command line switches are available through the use of radio buttons, pulldowns, etc. \n\nBasically, we accidentally created a very user friendly front end to a publicly available command line only data processing system that is very NOT user friendly. Within a couple of months, we were using it as a QA/QC tool as well as a troubleshooting tool for seismic data. We could catch problems in near real time that it typically took at seismic surveyor weeks or months to catch after the data had all been collected and sent off to a processing house. For the record, I'm no programmer.. but back in the day I was a hell-on-wheels shell scripter. LOL",

        "text": "This happened about 15 years ago. I built a tower computer for a friend of mine and it worked fine for about a year, but then it started having issues. One day he calls me and the conversation goes a little something like:  \n  \n$F: That computer you built me has started rebooting when I shake my desk.  \n$Me: Wait, what? Like, you're shaking the tower?  \n$F: No, when I shake my desk. It started happening once in a while but now it's happening all the time. I figured out that when I go to get up from my desk I put two hands on the front of my desk to push away from it, the desk shakes a little, and the computer reboots. Not every time, but often enough that something is wrong.  \n$Me: Is the tower on top of your desk?  \n$F: No, it's on the floor next to the desk.  \n$Me: Is the tower touching the desk?  \n$F: No, there's a couple inches between the tower and the desk to allow air flow.  \n  \nSo I go over to his place to see what the hell is going on. The tower is, indeed, sitting next to the desk and not touching it. He shook the desk and it didn't reboot, so he shook it again a little harder and sure enough the computer spontaneously reboots. At this point I'm not sure what's going on, maybe there's a wire short in the case or at one of the I/O connectors on the back of the motherboard. So I completely unhook the tower from all of his peripherals and take it into the other room, open up the case and check all the internal wiring to make sure nothing's loose. I then  Grab his monitor but a separate keyboard and mouse and plug them all in and the tower and boot it up on the coffee table and it's fine. I even pick up the tower and give it a little shake and it's fine. I plug KB and Mouse into various USB ports and they're fine. I wiggle cables on the back of the motherboard and everything is fine.  \n  \nAt this point I'm just scratching my head. I put the tower back, hook up all the wires, and sure enough shaking the desk causes it to reboot again. Must be a peripheral you say? Well, he didn't have anything but his mouse, keyboard, printer, network cable, and a couple unhooked USB cables zip tied to his desk for plugging in MP3 player and camera. I play with all the wires on the back of the motherboard and everything is fine. I even run an extension cord to the tower and use a different power cable, but nothing. The computer still reboots when the desk is shaken, but only when the desk is shaken.  \n  \nSo we proceed to clear out everything on the desk so I can start checking peripherals one-by-one. As we're doing this I brush the two USB cables (not hooked up to anything, mind you) and the computer reboots. What the hell... I pick up the cables and touch the outer metal of the USB plugs together and *tink* the computer reboots. *tink* reboot. *tink* reboot. What in hell?  \n  \nI take a look at where those two USB lines are plugged into; one is plugged directly into one the motherboard's USB ports but the other is plugged into a PCI slot USB header (just a header, not a card/hub). So I pull the tower out to have a look at this USB header and apparently I had an older one I'd recycled into this system for him, because this older USB header used all five pins where as most headers omit the 5th pin ground used for the USB shielding. Near as I can tell the motherboard USB was grounded to the case but the header USB was grounded through the motherboard and the grounds were not level, so touching the outer shielding on the two USB cables caused enough of a jolt to make the system restart. And if this sounds like the [More Magic](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/magic-story.html) button that's probably because both instances were caused by the same grounding issue, although I didn't know about the More Magic story back then. The fix was for me to take out my wire cutters and remove the 5th pin grounding wire from the USB header. What really gets me is that in removing and replacing the tower I somehow managed to plug the two USB cables back into opposing USB ports.",

        "author": "JustAnOldITGuy",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/969us3/help_us_old_sql_guru_youre_our_only_hope_we_need/",
        "text": "As I've said in other posts, I get to do some interesting work with SQL and people sometimes come to me after giving up all hope. This time is no different. This one blurs the line between support and development.\n\nWe are installing a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system from a major vendor and at our project consultants guidance we are using a third party tool to schedule the jobs that run on this system. The reason we are using this tool is the tool is agnostic meaning it will not only run the jobs for the ERP system it will all run the jobs for the attached business intelligence and .NET applications we use to run our business.\n\nThe expert consultant spent months creating these jobs but the closer we got to production the more problems we run into. Part of the schedulers job is to determine the order jobs should run. Especially for Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) as well as all of the financial jobs. Many of these are starting to fail as jobs are starting before their predecessor completes or in some cases are just in the wrong sequence. Unfortunately to figure this out you have to go screen by screen in the application and take notes or run dozens of very rudimentary reports and then blend them together. The expert consultant says no problem he will write a report to show us all how this works. \n\nWe hire a scheduler to take over the scheduling. \n\nAfter about eight weeks of deteriorating communication and cooperation the consultant gives us a very lame report and a bill and exits stage left.\n\nThe director and the new scheduler come to me and ask if I will take a look. (I had done some other deep reports for the director before.)\n\nOf course I say sure why not. I give no promises as I have never worked with this application before and I could just as easily turn up empty handed.\n\nSo we ended up in an internal political struggle over access to the underlying data in an Oracle database. After resolving this issue I get to query the back end directly. But due to license restrictions I cannot have a log on to the actual application...\n\nSo I work with the scheduler. Mostly I look over his shoulder and ask questions, take notes and get him to send me screen shots.\n\nNow I log on to the database using TOAD. One of my favorite SQL tools. The table names are mostly close enough to the screen names in the application I begin to make some progress. Looking at TOAD I discover for the first time a commercial application that uses foreign keys (for the most part) and good relational database design. Once I start finding the data from the screen shots I am able to use this to pull the threads together for all the other tables.\n\nThe biggest problem we have is that the jobs are in a hierarchy. Any level in the hierarchy can have a collection of jobs as well as another group of jobs. The groups can have groups. This goes down six levels. I look at the report the consultant wrote and he had no idea how to do recursion in SQL. Not only that he did not set up the dependencies between jobs or use the hierarchy correctly. \n\nThe main job table has a list of all of the jobs/groups with a unique identity field, job name, system, etc.. In one of the other job tables I find a column for the same identity field of parent job/group and a column for  the identity field of the child job/group . Bingo we are in business. This is the table that controls the hierarchy.\n\nI put together the recursive logic into a Common Table Expression and have it generate the whole job picture. Hierarchy and dependencies as well as job titles etc.\n\nDid I mention I love TOAD? One of the things you can do with TOAD is export not only to a file but directly to an open Excel spreadsheet. So I dress up the query with aliases for the database column names and the levels of the nesting within the job schedule. Run the query, export to Excel, some quick formatting and save and send.\n\nI send this to the scheduler and at first he is very happy but then the \"if only it did this...\" requests start. We are running this on a daily basis as he straightens out the job structure from the consultant, gets things in the right order and resets the hierarchy. The ERP application is settling down and people are beginning to trust our efforts. In the meantime I am implementing the embellishments.\n\nThe hardest one is to get the technical information from the ERP job being scheduled, which program, which version, what parameters,etc.. He sends me a screen shot and I look in the database and don't see anything that matches the screen as far as table structures etc. Long story short the scheduling application uses XML fields and an XML structure for this information. Since they support every major ERP vendor and each one has different characteristics this is for them a perfect solution.\n\nSo now I get to learn about XPath and using that to pull out data. I add this to the output and now we are very happy.\n\nThe initial report took about two weeks and the embellishments as there were many more took about another four weeks of iterative development. During that same time the scheduler is straightening out the whole schedule and we are able to go-live without this being an issue. At that time there we have over a thousand jobs to keep track of and straighten out. Now we are about double that. Fun times! Thanks for reading.",

        "text": "As the offshore systems administrator, I was more or less responsible for every piece of electronics on the ship that was not handled by the engineering crew. The company I worked for had a very \"You can do it!\" attitude about pretty much everything. It was not unusual for me to be handed a piece of equipment I had never heard of, seen, or even knew existed and be expected to have it up and running within a few hours/days. \n\nIn this case, we are working off the coast of Nigeria in 2009. That's around the time several ships were boarded or attacked by pirates. Just before we are scheduled to leave the dock in Ghana, a crate appears on the helipad. I'm told that it's a camera and that it's my job to get it set up and working. I've installed a few cameras in my time, so I figured it was no big deal. I was wrong...\n\nIn the crate was a roughly $70,000 FLIR waterproof **THERMAL** PTZ camera weighing about 70lbs. The engineering crew was nice enough to mount the camera on the ship's mast and run the cable down to the bridge for me. At that point, I had to finish the setup. There was a main box, monitor, and joystick. The main box required inputs from the ship's gyro, GPS, and RADAR. After a bit of tinkering, I got the main box running, mounted the display, mounted the joystick, and got a picture on the screen. The joystick controls were reversed and it took me a while to get that figured out. \n\nI was trying to figure out how to connect the RADAR, looking through the manuals for both the RADAR and the FLIR camera. The idea was that you could select a target on the radar and the FLIR camera would point at that target so that you could see what it was. The camera had daylight, infrared, and thermal capabilities. Theoretically, this would allow us to identify pirates before they were close enough to board us. After several hours of digging through manuals and not making any headway, I decided to call the support line of the RADAR manufacturer. What follows is a brief exchange between myself ($me) and their support technician ($support).\n\n$support: RADAR support, how can I help you?\n\n$me: I've been asked to slave a camera to our RADAR. I see that there is a target identification output, but I can't find that output. \n\n$support: Yes, if your RADAR does not have a target ID output on the back panel, then you'll have to connect some wires to the terminal strip inside the RADAR. We can have a technician come down to help you with that. \n\n$me: I'm afraid that this is time sensitive and that we are in a remote location.\n\n$support: I highly recommend that you leave this to a support technician.\n\n$me: Is there any way you could walk me through this? \n\n$support: I really don't think so. If you touch the wrong thing inside the RADAR cabinet, it **WILL** kill you. \n\n$me: Wow... ok... Well, we are 200 miles off the coast of Nigeria in pirate infested waters. When can you get a technician to me? \n\n$support: ... So, start by taking off the rear panel screws. You are looking for a terminal strip at the bottom right when you are looking at the back of the unit. The terminal strip is green. DO NOT TOUCH any of the capacitors or transformers on the left side of the unit. Depending on your camera, you may need an A-&gt;D board. RX goes to terminal block 3, TX goes to terminal block 2, and ground goes to terminal block 16. If you don't see target data, try reversing 2 and 3. DO NOT TOUCH **ANYTHING** inside other than the terminal strip. \n\n\nI never did get the RADAR targeting to work... we unfortunately did need that \nA-&gt;D board. ",

        "text": "Back to my days surveying offshore... So, we were working off the coast of Japan, surveying the ocean floor looking for a good route to run a subsea fiberoptic cable. This was in 2000 or 2001. I was the systems administrator and data processor. As I've said in previous posts, I typically worked a 12 hour shift, in this case 6am to 6pm.\n\nPart of finding a good cable route was making sure you didn't drape the cable over any cliffs, seamounts, volcanoes, etc.\n\nWe had a number of people responsible for making sure that we avoided any of those obstacles. The person running the multibeam and collecting the data was to notify the data processor (me), the client rep, the geophysicist, and the CAD guy of any obstructions as soon as they were noticed. Just as I was about to get off shift and go to bed, we noticed a cliff/ridge/fault in the realtime data. We notified the necessary people, ended the line we were collecting, and notified the bridge crew that we were going to have to do some exploration. This meant turning 90 degrees to the line we had just collected and following the ridge to find either the end of the ridge or a safe pass over/through the ridge. The client rep was asking me to process the most recent data about every 15-20 minutes. This was fine for the first 2-3 hours after my shift ended, but it was starting to get old. After 6 hours, I was getting seriously tired and worrying that I might make a stupid mistake, so I started hacking together a shell script that would:\n\nCopy the latest data from the collection machine to the processing machine.\n\nClean up the navigation, motion sensor, and gps data.\n\nProcess the multibeam data using statistical filters to clean up as much noise as possible and apply the previously mentioned sensor data.\n\nProduce a 1:10,000 scaled sun source shaded color map of the processed bathymetry.\n\nSend that map to the color plotter for the client rep to look at.\n\nI then wrote a graphical button that I could press to call the script and produce the map.\n\nAfter a bit of testing to verify that it all worked, I notified the client rep that I needed to get some sleep and showed him how to use the \"autosurvey\" feature. I stayed up with him for another hour or so and watched him produce a few maps, much to his delight, then wandered off to bed. I managed to sleep through the night. The client rep was VERY happy with his magic button and we ended up using it here and there for the rest of the job. It did not take the place of the normal full processing required for producing the real maps, but it was enough to be able to scout for locations to move the cable.\n\nTL;DR: Lazy data processor gets tired and writes a script to do part of his job for him so he can get some much needed sleep.",

We all know how hard it is to work with users who can't tell CPU's from modems (\"I have it plugged directly into the CPU!\" or \"You mean the modem (pointing to their computer tower),\" yet have the most ambiguous, yet specific demands conceivable.\n\nI am leaving the Help Desk life.  I got myself a job as a penetration tester for a cyber security firm.  I had (hopefully) one final experience at my company to share with you all today - and this (hopefully) will be my last tale from tech support.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------\n\nDispatched out to a customer's desk for a monitor swap.  Our company gives a budget every year to employees to order new computer hardware.  This particular individual decided to use his spending on an extra wide, 4k monitor.  The monitor was already delivered to his desk, and I just had to go out to unplug his old one, plug in his new one, and make sure it works.\n\n*Just finished unplugging his old monitor, plugged in his new one, and powering it on*.\n\nUser: Why are the icons so big?\n\nTech: We'll have to set the resolution to its native size.  Then they'll be the correct size.  *Change to native resolution, some astronomically high numbers*\n\nUser: Well now everything's too big, can you zoom it in more?\n\nTech: Yeah, sure.  *Change magnification to 125%*\n\nUser: Still to small, can you make it bigger?\n\nTech: Yeah, no problem.  *Change to 150%*\n\nUser: Well, that's too big, can you make it 132%?\n\nTech:  *Thinking that's an oddly specific number.*   Unfortunately, no we can set it to 125% or 150%, let's take a look at them and find out which works better for you.\n\nUser: Oh, OK.\n\nTech:  *change between 125% and 150% a few times, asking user which looks better, and he can't decide*\n\nUser: What's your ching-chong name?\n\nTech: I'm sorry?\n\nUser: There's no way your first name is *John*.  What's your real name?\n\nTech: No, that's my name.\n\nUser: Oh, so you were born here?\n\nTech: No, but I grew up here mostly.\n\nUser: There's no way your real name is *John*.  C'mon, tell me, what's your ching-chong name?\n\nTech: No, that's my name.\n\nUser: Bull-shit.  You don't look anything like a *John*.  You've gotta have a ching-chong name.  What's your last name?\n\nTech: *Kawashima*\n\nUser: So what, is that Japanese?\n\nTech: Yes.\n\nUser: Are you married?\n\nTech: Yes.\n\nUser: Is she Japanese too?\n\nTech: Yes.\n\nUser: Hey, this monitor looks smaller than it did before.\n\nTech: You mean, the resolution of the screen?\n\nUser: No, I mean physically smaller.  Did you do something to it?  Does your wife have a ching-chong name?\n\nTech: No, it's the same monitor.\n\nUser: I know that, but it looks smaller.  You must've changed something.\n\nTech: It's physically the same monitor, nothing's changed.\n\nUser: Let me find something to measure it with.  What's your wife's name?*Has nothing to measure it with, but is convinced I somehow physically shrank his monitor.*And the color doesn't look good.  Why is it so bright?  Can we change that?\n\nTech: *Adjust brightness*.  I'd rather not talk about my wife.\n\nUser: It's too yellow.  I bet she has a ching-chong name.\n\nTech: *Found that this monitor is set to default on \"Warm,\" toggled through settings and user can't decide if he likes \"Cool\" or \"User\" better.*\n\nUser: I don't know, what do you think?  I think Cool looks better.\n\nTech: Yeah, sure.  *Change to cool*\n\nUser: Second thought, I don't like that, can we change it back to user.\n\nTech: *Change it and show it to the user so he can change it on his own*\n\nUser: I don't like that.  You expect me to do your job for you?  Changing these settings are your job.  Look, \"John,\" I like you, but you need to get a better attitude about your work.  I'll make sure to leave you a good survey score, but I'm going to comment about your attitude.\n\nTech: Was there anything else you need at this time?\n\nUser: Actually, I don't want this monitor here anymore.  Can you swap this monitor with that one? (dual monitor set up).\n\nTech: *Unplug everything, move it, plug it all back in*\n\nUser: Second thought, now that I see it, I want it back where it was earlier.\n\nTech: You're sure?\n\nUser: Yes, swap them back.\n\nTech: *Swaps them back*\n\nUser: *Rocking the monitor back and forward*.I don't know, John.  This monitor still looks smaller than before.\n\nTech: It's the same monitor.\n\nUser: i know that!  You changed something.\n\nTech: Nothing was changed except the resolution settings which we went over together.\n\nUser: No, no.  Something else changed.  It's smaller than before.\n\nTech: It's the exact same size.\n\nUser: I'm going to find something to measure it with later.  Anyway, you're free to go.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd I hope this is the last job like this I have to do at this company.  I deal with a whole bunch of other bull shit here, but I hope this is the end of it.  One of my colleagues knows of this story, and reminded me I only have a few more weeks of this.",

        "text": "Hey everyone! Long time lurker first time poster. Let me tell you a story about the time that introduced me to the worst side of MSPs and the worst of clients. \n\nSo, I had been working at $MSP for some time. About two years or so at this point. It was a small company with 4 of us techs and two bosses. One boss $J who was our COO was one of those \"company guys\" who only really cared about our bottom line. We had a few whale clients, but with the way things were going we were hemorrhaging money since the previous owner left. $J was trying to take advantage of every source of revenue he could to keep the company above water. This was more to keep his six figure paycheck and it was obvious. \n\nOne day we get a call in from a new prospective client. Enter $L, she seemed normal enough. And older woman who didn't know much about computers. She said she had had a falling out with her previous IT provider for her home and she was concerned about some of the equipment he had put in. (This should have been red flag number 1). I schedule a time to drive out to her place and take a look at the equipment in question and see if there is anything that needs to be done. Pretty standard house call stuff right?... Right?\n\nA few days later I drive out to her house. Its a little cottage on a larger estate in a really affluent part of the area. $J probably saw dollar signs as soon as he saw the area code. So I pull up into their parking lot and am greeted by $L: Early 60s, 5 foot nothing, probably less than 100lbs soaking wet, and wrapped in three big shawls. She greeted me and seemed super happy to see me. \"This is gonna be easy\" I thought \"Take a look at the equipment, talk to her for a half hour or so, leave here to go directly home, awesome\". And let me tell ya, thats how this first visit ended up going. She had a computer that was custom built, a nice linksys router, and an HP wireless printer, pretty standard. She said that there was some weird behavior with the PC and that she hasnt turned it on in about two weeks. I ask if she wants me to take a look at it for her while im there. She says \"No i dont want it on in my house until you look at it, take it with you\". I say okay and pack it up in my car to bring back, thinking \"That was a little weird but whatever.\" This should have been red flag number 2. \n\nI get the computer back to the office the next day and get it all set up and boot it up. Runs like a charm. Its a beast too! I do my usual cleanup/diagnosis. Malwarebytes picks up a few adware things and I remove them. Some popups stop coming up when you open IE and I figure this was the weird behavior she was talking about so I wrap it up to bring back over to her so she can sit with me and confirm its working to her liking. (CYCLE OF SERVICE ERRYDAY)\n\nSo I get there and $L is waiting for me with her husband, nice guy, much older probably in his mid 70s. He introduced himself and we BS'ed for a while. This is unrelated but he told me he used to be Jonny Cash's dentist, so thats pretty neat. Anyway $L greets me and goes upstairs to grab a notebook. Her husband pulls me aside and his face suddenly gets very serious. He says \"Today she is going to tell you some things that are going to sound absurd. I understand this is strange but please do your best to be as professionally normal as possible about it.\" red flag 3. \n\n$L comes back downstairs with notebook in hand and a manila folder full of papers. She pulls up a chair next to me where I set up her computer and we turn on the PC to go through it. Here is where things start to get weird. \n\nI turn it on and it hits POST, because its a custom rig the BIOS message pops up due to not being disabled. Suddenly $L goes \"THERE THERE IT IS! ONE OF THE THINGS!\" I ask her what she means. \"CHUCKEY CHEESE! I CALL MY OLD IT GUY THAT, HE PUT THIS ON MY COMPUTER TO WATCH ME\". Im thinking okay this is getting a bit weird but hey shes older and technology can be scary when you dont understand it. I try to do my best with older clients to make them comfortable and happy. I explain that this is just a message the computer spits out when it turns on before it gets to Windows. I even go into the BIOS and turn it off so it just shows the mobo logo at that point. She makes a note of it in her book and we move on to Windows itself. She asks me to set up a new email account for her on gmail. I do so and set it up with her outlook and shes happy. I ask if she forgot her password to her old email or something and if she would like me to try and help recover her account. \"No thank you! Chuckey Cheese already has control of that account!\". \"Okay... did he sign you up for your own address or just use gmail or something?\" I figure perhaps this old IT guy set her up with a custom domain or something and he ran the email infrastructure for it. \"No it was gmail. He hacked my account\". This kinda conversation keeps coming up every now and then as im going through her computer with her. \"Whats that? what are you doing?\" \"Jotting down some notes for me here in notepad\" I say. \"Oh you shouldnt use notepad... Chuckey Cheese used to love that one to spy on me\" (are you seeing where this is going?). I explain everything to her as best I can. I tell her that with the setup she has now she owns everything and there is nothing malicious on her computer. She seems happy, her husband thanks me on the way out and offers me $100 as a tip. I turn it down because I like him and want to build a good client relationship. \n\nA few days goes by and no word from $L. Then one afternoon I get a call from her husband. $L is not happy. She is saying that all the problems have come back and that rather than trying to fix it she just wants a new PC and a new router. I ask what issues have come back and if they are sure they dont want me to try and fix them. He says he just wants to pay for the new computer and setup to make $L happy. I let $J know and he immediately orders the most expensive touch screen all in one Lenovo makes and a Dell Sonicwall firewall (because they will pay for it so $J figures why not). Everything comes in a few days later and I do the configurations at the office, and drive out to $L's to install everything. \n\nI get there and $L seems different. She is angry and argumentative with her husband. He is trying to tell me what she said and she shouts him down and calls him names. I'm starting to get uncomfortable. I set everything up, show her how it all works, she seems fine, and I head out. I kinda understood why she might be in a bad mood, she paid for a service and wasnt satisfied. But oh boy did everything escalate from here. \n\nI'm out sick about a week later and $L calls up the office. My co-worker (and good friend) $A ends up having to go over there. We are hanging out the next day at his place smoking weed and he tells me how he thinks $L is unhinged. We laugh about it and dont think too much. \n\nThat is until next time I have to go back there. ($J wanted us to go on site there as much as they were willing to pay for, they had deep pockets and $J knew this). I get there and $L is out at an appointment. Her husband is there and he tells me that she has been saying her wireless printer has been hacked. I take a look at the setup and diagnostics and i see nothing weird. This printer is disconnected form the internet, and is used via a USB that she unplugs after she is done. I explain this to him and he basically says \"Listen I know there is probably nothing wrong, but her therapist wanted me to get a professional in here to reassure her that noone is watching her.\" oh.... well.... shit. He goes on to say how she keeps taking his phone and deleting his apps saying \"they are used to spy on us you idiot!\" and things like that. He mentions that he hasnt even been able to listen to his music on Pandora because she thinks its a \"backdoor\". Thankfully he had a new car that had an app store built in. I set up pandora on his car for him so at least this poor bastard can have some tunes. We agree that this is gonna be just between us. No problem. So, $L gets back from what i then realized was a therapy appointment. She comes in with the same nice demor that she had the first visit. I show her everything that was set up, and explain to her about her printer not being attacked. \n\nThis kinda thing keeps going on for a few more weeks and I am going out to their place now pretty much every 3 days or so. $J is charging them out the ass for this and thinks its great. I am starting to have problems with it because I realize that we are straight up taking advantage of a mentally ill person. I bring this up to $J at one point and he basically says \"Her husband is willing to pay for it so we are willing to do the work\". \n\nEverything started to go south after 2 or 3 months of this. $L was getting worse. I would go there and she would have stacks of diagnostic printouts from windows and her printer. Having me sit there with her for hours going line by line, asking \"well what about THIS\" pointing to some mundane system call or something. She keeps saying that \"Chuckey Cheese is back in, you said you were good at this? What is he better than you? You have to do something about this guy.\" She also started to tell me over and over that their bank accounts were missing hundreds of thousands of dollars and that she was reporting it to her bank but they too were infiltrated by Chuckey Cheese and they would not help her. Her husband later pulled me aside to tell me that no, no money was missing, he had been checking his accounts regularly. $L was slipping further into her delusions. And I was getting more and more uncomfortable being there. I am a tech nerd, not a therapist, and I strongly felt we were taking advantage of her. But $J's reasoning was, \"she is paying, go there or ill find someone who will\". \n\nAnd then one day I had to go back again. $L was on one of her \"good days\" all smiles, talking about her horses, super cheery. That is until I a said \"$L, I have gone through this with you several times before, these diagnostic reports will not show you anything you need to be concerned about. We have found no evidence of any malicous stuff going on with your equipment and we have put in all our own equipment I configured myself. You can be assured that there is no-one watching you\" This set her off on a tirade. She yelled at me about how \"YOU CLEARLY DONT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING HOW CAN YOU SAY NOONE IS WATCHING ME WHEN YOUR VIRGIN BUDDY $A IS LOGGING INTO MY COMPUTER EVERY NIGHT TO MESS WITH ME NOW ON TOP OF CHUCKEY CHEESE\" ....what? And then the part that you were all waiting for \"AND IF YOUR ASS OF A BOSS $J DOESNT GET SOMEONE IN HERE WHO CAN FIX MY PROBLEMS I AM GONNA GO GET MY GUN AND SHOOT YOU ALL MYSELF\" RED FLAGS ALERT CRAZY WITH FIREARMS IN THE HOUSE. I do my best do defuse the situation without setting her off. Saying that I will do everything in my power to get to the bottom of anything she says is going on and that she can count on me. I lied. Fuck that. I wanted to get out of there and never come back. \n\nSo, I get back to the office and immediately go tell $J what $L said. He says something to the effect of \"Come on man, shes a frail old lady, are you really gonna be scared of her?\" \"yes. She has a mental illness and has said she has guns in the house\". He responds \"Well you have to go tomorrow to drop off this new printer for her. If you really have a problem go and take $A with you.\" I am a very passive person and dont argue well with people in authority above me. So I stupidly say \"okay... ill take care of it\". \n\nThe next day $A and I drive out to their house. Drop off the printer, and $L comes home. She is furious that $A is there. \"HOW DARE YOU BRING THAT MAN INTO MY HOUSE AFTER ALL HE HAS PUT ME THROUGH.\" $A is way more assertive than me and is having none of it \"Listen Lady, I dont know what you think is going on but I have never touched your computer after I came here that one time. I dont care enough about you to mess with you. You arent being attacked, youre therapist wants us here to reassure you but if you aren't going to listen to us we have no more business here.\" and we left. When we got back to the office $J was pissed. He had gotten a call from $L saying that we were horrible to her and she demanded a refund for all the months we had worked with her which had amounted to over $10k. $J said that he was so sorry and that he would be sending me back out if she was okay with it to look at any issues she was having and that we valued her as a client blah blah blah. \n\nAt this point $A is looking out for me and knows how I am. He tells me \"Dude you have to go talk to our other boss right now. Hes a lawyer by trade and there is no way this is okay.\" So I go into our other boss the CFO's office and tell him whats up. He is horrified and hasnt been told anything. Once I got to the part of the story where she threatened to shoot people he cut me off, walked me over to $J's office and said. There is no way we can let this go on. I dont care how much money we are making. Call her and tell her we are terminating her contract. $J was clearly very mad about this but he had to listen to his lawyer because they both knew that at that point I would have a promising OSHA case if i ever wanted to pursue it. \n\nOver the next few months after all this $J clearly had it out for me. He saw it as me loosing the company a whale. But he knew he couldnt do anything about it. It was overall a very hostile work environment after this. One day at lunch after being yelled at by $J for some unrelated thing, I put my resume up on Indeed out of spite. A few weeks later I get a call for an interview. I land it after I get the offer I go into $Js office and quit. I am now a 'nix administrator at a medium sized university and couldn't be happier. As shitty as the situation was I consider it a valuable learning experience. Now I know what to look for in a potential work environment and employer. But yeah, that was the time I thought I was gonna get shot at because a crazy thought some hacker named chuckey cheese was ruining her life. \n",

        "text": "I'm a developer now (was QA at the time), not tech support, but hopefully this still counts. A couple years ago when I was fresh outta college and starting my first job as automation QA at a medical software company, I met a guy that worked there who was genuinely the worst developer I have ever met, and still works there by some miracle.\n\nSo there I was, running a few of our automated test suites, when I saw that there was an icon that should display on a study in the grid when it has a 3D imaging view available throwing a 404. I check the source folder on the server, lo and behold, the image file is no longer there. No big deal, I log a bug in TFS, this should be a super easy fix, right? Oh how I wish it was...\n\n$Dev pings me and asks if he can come to my desk to discuss the bug. Uh, yeah, okay, sure... but why? Just re-add the file for the next build. He comes to my desk. This is the first time I've met the guy, boy was it a trip.\n\n$Dev: \"Hi. I see you logged a bug for 404 on this icon.\"\n\n$Me: \"Yep. You should just need to add the image back to the source folder and it'll be all good.\"\n\n$D: \"OK. What is 404?\"\n\nNo fucking way. This guy doesn't know what a 404 error code is. Who the fuck are we hiring? I show him what a 404 is, spend a few mins explaining it. He doesn't get it, nor does he know how to fix this error.\n\n$M: \"Alright, alright. Here. Let me google search an icon with the same extension.\" I google up a .svg file, save it  to my local and then copy it to the server folder and rename it to the name that the product is looking for. \"See? Now it shows that new icon because it's where the product is searching for. You just need to put the actual icon file it's looking for here\"\n\n$D: \"Ohhhhh okay!\"\n\nI have now spent 20 mins teaching the developer what a 404 HTTP error code is, and shown him how to fix the bug. It ended up getting assigned to another dev cuz this guy didn't fix it. I have more stories of working with this dude if anyone is interested.",

        "text": "Here's another story from my time working offshore. As the offshore systems administrator, I wore many hats and had many responsibilities. I setup and maintained pretty much every PC, workstation, server, switch, router, UPS, data collector, etc. on the boat. I also handled data processing for multibeam, sidescan, subbottom, magnetometer, and seismic data. I worked 12 hour days, typically either from noon to midnight or midnight to noon. On this particular hitch, I was working from noon until midnight. This was a couple hundred miles off the coast of Nigeria in 2009 or so. \n\nCast of characters:\n\n$me: me, myself, and aye\n\n$crewman: random boat crew\n\n$captain: captain of the ship\n\n$support: Norwegian tech support person\n\n\nI am awakened by someone pounding on my cabin door. I've been asleep for almost 4 hours. I open the door to see a somewhat panicked crewman. \n\n\n$me: What's up?\n\n$crewman: Our helicopter lander system is down, you need to come see immediately!\n\n$me: (blinks) What's a helicopter lander system?\n\n$crewman: No time! Come now!\n\n$me: (starts getting dressed while wondering exactly what I'm in for) Ok, give me a minute. \n\n$me: ( Heads up to the bridge )\n\n$captain: Our helicopter lander system is not coming up. We have a helicopter on the way, but he doesn't have enough fuel to loiter more than 30 minutes. He's roughly an hour and a half out. If we can't get the system up in less than two hours, he'll have to return to base for fuel. We need to know as soon as possible if you can get the system up. (points me to a screen displaying a \"Insert system disk\" error and a beige box)\n\nOh boy, this is bad. I open up the box and check connections. When I do so, I see that there are two hard drives. I take both drives out plug them into another machine to see if I can see any data. I discover that the lander system is DOS based. The primary hard drive is toast, it knocks loudly but never fully spins up. The secondary hard drive has a backup copy of the lander system. YAY!! I pull a hard drive from one of our spare PC's, format it, and make it bootable. I don't remember where I managed to find a copy of DOS... I install the new(ish) primary hard drive and copy the backup data from the secondary drive. I now have the lander computer booted and the software running, so I bring it up to the bridge. Roughly 45 minutes have elapsed. I install the lander system and connect the gyro, gps, motion sensor, and weather sensors to it, but it's not showing any data from any of those systems. I tell the captain, and he's very pleased that the computer is up, but worried about the sensor data. The lander system cannot function without that data. He gives me a 10+ year old customer service card with a phone number in Norway. I call and wake someone up...\n\n$me: Hello? \n\n$technican: Yes, hello? How can I help?\n\n$me: We have a helicopter lander system that crashed. I got the machine up and the software installed, but am not getting any data. \n\n$technician: You will need to set up all the inputs. This would be easiest if you had the configuration file. It is named xxxxxx.cfg. Do you have it?\n\n$me: I have one, but it appears to be blank...\n\n$technician: Oh, that's not good. Well, we can set up each input manually.\n\n$me: I have a helicopter inbound. I have about 30 minutes to get this system up. \n\n$technician: That's not enough time to manually configure. What's the name of your ship?\n\n$me: It's the R/V mumblemumble\n\n$technician: Great! We have your configuration file from 10 years ago, assuming nothing changed. Do you have email? \n\n$me: Yes... but it's very slow.\n\n$technician: The file is only a few kilobytes, what is your email address?\n\n$me: (gives email address)\n\nThe technician then walks me through installing and testing the configuration file and we are good to go. I'm able to inform the captain within 15 minutes of the deadline that the lander system was operational. Due to the wind and sea conditions, it took about 15 minutes to get the chopper landed, but it was inside the time window for the helicopter to be able to make it back to its base. \n\nTL;DR: I was woken from a dead sleep to fix a system I'd never even heard of, with a strict deadline of less than 2 hours... and pulled off a miracle.\n",

        "text": "I promised I’d tell the tale of what finally broke the camel’s back and made me quit the job at the sleazy fix-it store. This is only borderline TFTS so if it sways too far from TFTS standards tell me and i'll remove it.\n\n\nAs I have written in previous tales I like to have a spot of femininity when I work in such a male dominated area as IT. The day this happened I was trying out a pretty cool utiliskirt a sewing genius friend of mine made for me, think a kneehigh belted skirt made from tough cargopants material with enough pockets to carry a serious doomsday-prepper’s EDC kit with pockets to spare. I won’t bore you with fashion details so let’s just say it fit in rather well with my goth-y attire I favoured back then (and still do sometimes but thats beside the point). \n\n\nNow, in the fix-it shop we had a baby project. It was simply called The Tower and consisted of a full size tower packed to the brim with the highest spec goodies available at the time. This project was the boss’ lovechild and was supposed to be his present for his son (henceforth Sleazeball McGrabbyhands) who sometimes worked hours at the fix-it shop, when he turned 18. Parts had been bought, shipped, installed, rewired and replaced with newer and better goodies serval times plus done up with enough LED lights to rival the most garish American christmas tree, all to the boss’ very specific orders. \n\n\nNow, to explain why I call my former boss’ son what I do he was the slimiest person I have ever had the misfortune of working with. Any time he was in the same room to me I could almost feel his stare burning a hole through my bust. Add to that trying to bribe any good-looking woman who came to the store with store credit to get a date, trying to cop a feel whenever he thought he could get away with it and dropping not-so-very subtle hints about what he thought women were meant for (let’s just say it didn’t have anything to do with honest work and leave it at that) and you see what I mean.\n\n\nIt was the day before Sleazeball McGrabbyhands’s birthday and besides dealing with a full day of actual paying work I got the dubious honour of putting the yet again torn down and modified Tower back in shape and bring it to my boss’ office for the him to prep for Sleazeball McGrabbyhands' birthday. Of course on the day The Tower absolutely needs to be finished the store was at it's busiest it had been for months. Extras were called in and Sleazeball McGrabbyhands was one of them. \n\n\nAs you can imagine I was stressed out, both by legit work piling up and having to avoid/putting up with Sleazeball McGrabbyhands all day. At the end of the day when I was finally done putting The Tower back together again I picked it up, carefully balancing the heavy thing in my arms and carried it slowly from our build area towards the boss’ office. It was at this time Sleazeball McGrabbyhands came up behind me and, in his best “Tokyo subway molester” impression decided to grab a double handfull of my utiliskirt and backside. This startled me and I instinctively pushed myself away from his hands, shifting my balance enough that I lost my grip on The Tower. Down The Tower went and the horrible sound from it hitting the concrete floor made all the other techs turn to see what the frak just happened. What seconds before had been an expensive and time-consuming gaming rig project was now utter thrash. The case had smashed itself open on the concrete floor and pieces of circuitboard had spread out from it like a halo of fail and misery. I almost broke down and cried there and then. Only thing that stopped me from bawling my eyes out was my burning hate towards Sleazeball McGrabbyhands, who had decided to slink away quietly while I was staring at the remains of The Tower in disbelief. \n\n\nAfter sweeping up the circuitboard breadcrumbs I marched straight to my boss and told him what his good-for-nothing son had done and what it caused. Guess who my boss blamed for wrecking his son’s expensive birthday present? That’s right: Me.  \nAccording to my boss it was all my fault. I got called some very hurtful things, told that I should have put more effort into carrying it and that I should just have let his son grab me, no question asked. \n\n\nThat was it. Namecalling I can take but being told that defending myself from molestation was wrong was so above and beyond morally wrong it could be. I told my boss where he could shove the remains of The Tower and resigned on the spot, effective immediately. Walked out with my head held high and never regretted it.",

It was the first time he had built one so I just wanted to be safe. After taking the board out I could see that there was no thermal paste where it was supposed to be. \n\nBut then I noticed something else wrong, there was  a small amount of paste but it was on the actual chip itself oozing out. I try to open the housing and there is a mixture of broken pins and excessive thermal paste mixed together. I wipe off a little and see that the chip wasn’t put in place correctly and I can only assume was just forced closed.  I take it back to the father and show him that it is broken and the pins are either all bent or broken off completely. \n\nI leave the talking down the angry customer to my boss who heard the whole thing and I put the pieces into some containers we use for loose components. \n\nTLDR: you should never have to force anything into place.

Just try what I've suggested and give me a call if you need further help.\n\nI wish I were as magical as she thinks I am so that I could \"just fix it\" from my end without her needing to be in front of her computer.  I haven't heard anything back from her in a few days, so I'm assuming she either logged into her email or died trying to reset her password.",

This is actually a pretty common call, and GENERALLY the solution is one of the following:\n\n\n1) Make sure the computer is plugged into power\n\n2) Make sure that the power strip or UPS is turned on\n\n3) unplug the power cable, hit the power button a few times, then plug the cable back in. \n\nThis case threw me off my game. \n\nI'll be $me and branch manager shall be $bm. Notice that this is a branch MANAGER.\n\n$me: Helpdesk, this is me, how can I help you?\n\n$bm: My computer won't turn on. \n\n$me: Okay, is this a desktop or laptop?\n\n$bm: Desktop\n\n$me: Okay, is the computer plugged into a power strip?\n\n$bm: No, it's plugged directly into the wall. \n\n$me: Can you verify that the power cable is both firmly plugged into the wall and firmly into the back of the PC? \n\n$bm: Yes, it's plugged in on both sides. It was working fine this morning. \n\n$me: Okay, I'd like for you to unplug the cable from the back of the computer and while that cable is unplugged, go ahead and hit the power button a few times then plug the cable back in. \n\n$bm: I can't do that. \n\n$me: Do you have an injury that prevents you from crawling under the desk?\n\n$bm: No, it's too dark.\n\n$me: ... too dark? \n\n$bm: Yes, the lights are out.\n\n$me: **headdesk** Ma'am? I'm afraid your computer requires electricity to operate. Have you notified facilities maintenance? Is the whole branch without power? \n\n$bm: Yes, the whole branch is dark. \n\n$me: Please stay on the line while I send out notices that your branch is down. \n$bm: You mean we can't work? \n\n$me: ... not without power, no... do you know who your power provider is? \n\n$bm: no\n\n$me: no problem, I can find that information and try to get an ETA from the power company. I see your cell number is xxx-xxx-xxxx?\n\n$bm: That's right. \n\n$me: Okay, I'll let you go for now and call you back when I have an update.\n\n$me: *hangs up* **headdesk** *Starts standard procedure for branch down*\n\nTL;DR: Branch manager doesn't know that a power outage means that her desktop won't turn on.",

        "text": "My mom has been having some tech-confidence issues the past few years, so more and more often I am having to talk her through very basic things that she used to know how to do. I think I've tried teaching her to use the microphone icon to use talk to text literally 100 times and she still forgets. She also calls me to Google traffic updates for her even though I put the Navigation app on her home screen. \n\nSo, the past few years she's been complaining that her gmail address she's had for over a decade doesn't match her married name. She finally started migrating to her new one which likely means I will be in hell for the next 2 years each time she needs to go to a website to update her email address. \n\nA few months ago she calls me in a panic, \n\nMom: ALL MY CONTACTS ARE GONE!!!\n\nMe: It's fine, Mom, they're still stored in your Google account (talks her through importing them)\n\nThis happens every few weeks for months and I finally tell her to give me the phone. I look and her contacts are there, so I do an import just in case she's accidentally updated a contact while logged into her old account and then couldn't figure out why it's not saved to the new one. She's getting more and more frustrated that her contacts keep disappearing. \n\nFinally, yesterday I spend over an hour on the phone with her walking her through how to import contacts. This  takes ridiculously long because she's told me the problem is with her phone so I'm using my phone to describe where icons are. After the third or fourth time of her getting frustrated because she can't find things where I say they are, I think to ask,   \n\n\nMe: Are you on your phone or computer?\n\nMom: I'm on my computer. \n\nMe: I thought you were having issues with the phone?\n\nMom: No, I just want my contacts. \n\nMe: OK, here's how you get to your contacts...\n\nMom: Why aren't they on my phone? \n\nMe: Seriously, they are I restored them to your phone a while ago. Are you accidentally logged into your old account?\n\nMom: No, I'm in the right one, but I can't remember the email address.\n\nI talk her through getting into contacts again and ask if the person she's trying to email is there. Yes, they're in her phone, but she needs them for the computer. So at this point, I have no idea what the issue is. I once again explain how to open a contact. Realizing that we've done various forms of this for over an hour, I finally wise up and ask,   \n\n\nMe: What are you trying to do? \n\nMom: I need to email Beth. \n\nMe: OK, hit compose\n\nMom: I can't remember her email address. \n\nMe: Well you can click on the address in the contact or just start typing her name. \n\nMom: What do you mean? \n\nMe: You're in the email, right? \n\nMom: No, I don't know her address!\n\nMe: Hit compose *(I explain where it is)* \n\nMom: OK, but I don't know her email address.\n\nMe: Just click on To: and type her name, Mom.\n\nMom: OMG, I didn't know you could do that! \n\nSo I just spent 6 months troubleshooting a problem that doesn't exist because it's apparently been years since she's sent an email that wasn't either a reply or something she's typing off of a business card. I've informed my 14 yr old son that he's on Grandma-duty for the next month and I'm currently figuring out how I can remote in to all her devices so I never have to do this again. ",

        "text": "Been working as a IT Support Engineer for a few months for a small IT company with multiple clients dotted around the city. My day-to day job consists 50% remote - 50% onsite support.\n\nThe client in this post are a tight cost-cutting solicitors firm that will save every pence wherever and whenever they can so unsurprisingly they're also notoriously bad end-users. When I mean \"bad\" I'm not just talking IT-illiterate... they're the don't-pay-on-time, don't-apply-common-sense, how-have-you-survived-passed-puberty kind of bad.\n\nCast:\n\n$Me = yours truly\n\n$DU = dumb user\n\nA few weeks ago I was assigned a job at their main office (30-40 users) to help reconnect 4 client PCs that have been moved from their branch office that they've now closed permanently. They had already packed (poorly) all the devices, monitors, cables, peripherals in boxes and plastic shopping bags and everything bundled in the corner of the main office ready for me unpuzzle. Not all the PCs and monitors were the same brand/model and users being users -  they don't like change. So they MUST and INSIST on having the exact same device they were using in their old office.\n\n&gt;$Me: OK I'll setup $DU's computer first, do you know which one's yours? (*Points to the pile of devices in the corner).*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$DU: It should be the one in the box with X mark on it. (*Whilst busily reorganising all the paper files and folders on her desk).*\n\nI find that the monitors and towers (no cables attached) have been boxed up and packed as a set together, anything smaller like keyboards and mice were all jumbled into spaghetti junction elsewhere.\n\nI pull out the box she described and it only contained a monitor.\n\n&gt;$Me: (*Pulls out the monitor and showing the empty box)* Excuse me DU, but where is the rest of your computer?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$DU: What do you mean? That *IS* my computer (*pointing to the monitor I just pulled out).*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: (*Double checks it's not an AIO PC) Erm...* no, this is just your monitor that displays your PC. Your actual computer should look something like that (*points to another monitor-tower set).*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$DU: Oh! of course! It's here, I'm using it as my footrest! (*chin-points down below her desk whilst her hands shuffle more papers*).\n\nI look below and see the tower on the floor on it's side and what made me facepalm was not that she was using it as her footrest but I could see smooth side of the case on top where she rested her feet which could only mean...      dun dun DUNNN : the air vent side was faced down on the carpet.\n\nRealised this is how she had her tower positioned in her old office, I spent the next 15 minutes explaining why this is a no-no and jokingly said\n\n&gt;$Me: Yes, your PC will heat up and explode, blowing your feet apart if it doesn't get proper air-intake.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$DU: I guess I'll have to use something else as a footrest then...\n\nI finish connecting everything for her and login to make sure all the local printers are mapped and double check she can access this and that blah blah - usual checks.\n\nSo about an hour later when I'm just about to finish setting up the 4th user's PC, DU comes back to me...\n\n&gt;$DU: Hey um you there, um excuse me (*doesn't use my name).*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: (*Whilst under the desk weaving cables)* Oh hi, how can I-  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$DU: Yeah, I think there's a problem with my screen. Can you come take a look?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: (Now s*tanding behind her adjusting my junk as she sits back down at her desk)* What seems to be the problem?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$DU: Well, my screen looks funny.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: Umm how so? It looks fine, is it flickering occasionally or are the icons too big, are the texts blurry? (*throw me a goddamn bone dammit!)*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$DU: I think it looks a bit dark... Since you connected everything up it all looks a bit dark now. I dunno... maybe you touched something and now my screen looks funny. Why would you change it?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: (*Getting a bit annoyed)* I can assure you I haven't changed any of your settings, let me check your monitor brightness.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: Your settings seems to be already on max. (*We flick through a few presets if that's the one but ended staying with what she originally had)*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$DU: But it looks different! It's darker than what it used to be! Come sit here and tell me you don't find it a bit dark!\n\nI switch place with her and instantly stood back up before my ass could make full contact with the chair.\n\n&gt;$Me: I know what the problem is... please sit back down.\n\n\\*Tilts monitor down a few degrees\\*\n\nTL;DR User moves into new office, user says her screen has gotten darker, I tilt her screen down a bit for her.",

Naturally, the next thing to do was figure out why he was leaving us and what he meant by \"admin work\". \n \nI work for a company that has made and supports a certain CRM using an (extremely) extensive SQL database. It's pretty standard stuff though. A person has a database  record and in that record they have a name, address, contact details and a bunch of other information. The software can run reports (or just a CSV export) on more or less anything if the right SQL/XML is written, so if you want to get back all the people in your database who live in Kansas and don't have an email address but have had a criminal conviction in the last 3 years and have that emailed to your compliance department, it's more or less just a couple of lines of select/from/if/where/then statements. The software isn't the most intuitive thing in the world to use, but anyone who buys it can call the helpdesk anytime and make feature requests/report design requests.  We thought it might be useful to get in touch with the clients who never called. This guy (Operations Director) was one of them, and he was inches away from dropping our contract because the software apparently didn't meet his business requirements. \n\nIt turns out he had been given a CSV export by a colleague to run that would give him a list of names of people who needed to be contacted every month. Some 1000 people typically. He would then open up the CSV on one monitor, open the database on another monitor and go through each row (those 1000 or so people) and manually type in each person's email address in a new column. He would literally sit there and flick through records on the database and go through retyping their email addresses into the spreadsheet. Every. Month. \n\nTurns out his colleagues had all told him that \"that's just how the software works\", and had all been following the same process *for years.*\n\n",

        "text": "So this happened last night. I work overnights at an ISP and I remembered when I came in reading a \"Emergency Maintenance\" e-mail. Obviously I was not awake enough that it sunk in. Shortly after midnight, all Television services as well as my security cameras died. Of course, I called my On-Call who gently reminded me of maintenance. I internal message the maintenance admin. \n\nMe: Hey, uhhh did you just blow something up on accident?\n\nAdmin: I think I might have.\n\nMe: This was just moving a node from one ring to the other?\n\nAdmin: Yeah.\n\nMe: Well, we have no TV service, no security cameras. I don't know what else is affected.\n\nAdmin: Oh no.\n\nFast forward 35 minutes. E-mail comes in: Door Unlocked at DC - User: Boss Man. 5 minutes later, here comes my instant message. \n\nBoss Man: Hey, I heard and drove as soon as I could up to help. Looks like we overloaded the main router as well as egress. I'm working on it!! It looks like Admin might have made a mistake and made a loop with routing.\n\nAfter an hour and a half, and the 3 main admins and myself sitting in a group IM conversation, I sent out the \"Resolved\" e-mail.  Boss man came down to visit with me in my office. He left at approximately 2:00 - 2:15 AM. About 5:30 I start seeing tickets coming in. Customers from the moved node not having service. I instantly inspected the first ticket. No IPs. \"Well, crud,\" I thought to myself and grabbed my phone and dialed Boss Man. \n\nGroggily he answers, \"Hello?\"\n\nMe: \"Sorry to wake you sir, but I need to pick your brain.\"\n\nHim: \"What's going on?\"\n\nMe: \"Customers on XXX are not getting an IP. XXX  &amp; XXX VLANS are affected.\"\n\nHim: \"Ok, I'll look at it and e-mail you a quick fix, but we should probably have a conversation about what constitutes an emergency.\"\n\n\\*hang up\\*\n\nI was flustered, and embarrassed at this point. My spidey senses were tingling and I knew this was not a singular occurrence. Less than 5 minutes later an e-mail comes in from Boss Man telling me to switch to a different VLAN. I do as asked and instantly the IPs resolve. I respond to him that yes, it was definitely a fix. He e-mails me back saying he had to make a change in a router then. \n\nBy this point, I am seeing the tickets beginning to roll in. 3, 4, 5, I have no idea how many customers are affected and I'm worried that they would have had hundreds before 8 am. He e-mails me back again saying it should be fixed. I check accounts that I knew had already came in and breathe a sigh of relief. I continued to monitor them for a few minutes. I respond back to him \"I'm so sorry to wake you, I was just positive this was a bigger scope issue.\" He e-mails me back, \"I'm so sorry I was short with you, after I woke up and really started thinking I realized this was a bigger issue. We actually could have had a lot of customers without TV or Internet services this morning.\"\n\nWhew. I survived. Bonus? I e-mailed about the tickets and logged out to come home, shift was over. I wished the day shift guy good luck and walked out. ",

My mom still insists that she asked me to install TeamViewer for her, and now she sighs heavily when she has to install TeamViewer again, like it's a very complicated process.\n\n\n&gt;$mrlacpeanut: OK. But can you make a video call so I can show you how to install?\n\n&gt;$Mom: Why do you need a video call?\n\n&gt;$mrlacpeanut: Because I don't remember how to install it.\n\nSidenote, I don't remember how TeamViewer's install wizard look like.\n\n&gt;$Mom: I thought you know a lot about technology. Now you say me you do not know how to install TeamViewer? What a good IT.\n\nTL;DR: Mom is angry that she has to install TeamViewer, and then tells me I am a \"very good\" tech support because I don't remember how to install TeamViewer.\n\nEDIT1: My mom was hurried. She wouldn't have done this if she was not urgent. She called me later and apologized me.\n\n",

So I asked her, if she sewed. She delightfully said yes! She told me about all the things that she had made and about her sewing machine. I then asked if her sewing machine came with a foot pedal, she said yes. I furthered inquired if her computer also came with a foot pedal, she said yes but she needed to get another one because it was too small for her foot. She thought if she moved it around, it made the computer go, since when it moved the computer screen come on. I had to explain about how her \"foot pedal\" was really a mouse, she then said \"Wait! Mouse where?\" I had to mute her to keep from laughing. I spent about an hour going over how to use her mouse and what it was used for. Still one of my favorite stories to tell.",

        "text": "I work with my dad for his consulting company, specifically I am the support for a private K-12 Christian school and have been there for about a year now. I personally am an Atheist but it has not bothered me as most of my coworkers (not all of them) are very nice and our discussions focus on the tech problems they're having, not relating to religion. There are some though that I just know are Evangelicals, and some of them are quite crazy. One older lady is convinced that her computer is possessed by a ghost named Pepe because it asks her to change her password every 3 months to login (Active Directory setting) and sometimes the computer freezes or crashes (Old computers from 2006). That's a story for another time, though.\n\nThis story focuses around someone who we will refer to as **AD**. Last semester, she was an activities director for the students and organized the retreats they took, she also taught some middle school classes and was on a 4-person tech team that is only there to ask us for help and to install certain extensions on the Chromebook devices that the students have. Last semester she was not too involved with our work, this summer she was promoted to the I.T Director and works alongside us now but she has no background in PC repair or Network Administration, her only qualification is using domain apps and teaching other teachers how to use those domain apps. \n\nThe school has a 1:1 Chromebook program, and they did not purchase any accidental repair, is this sounding like a disaster to you guys? Because it is. Anyway, there is no accidental repair warranty so as you can imagine we are left to fix them. I'm only allowed to work 10 hours a week and of course I still had to deal with user issues and changing projector bulbs while fixing the Chromebooks in my office. The students were extremely irresponsible with them, when we first got the account we had to fix 60 that students had broken from the last year and nobody repaired because they thought they had accidental warranty because of a lack of communication between the former I.T director and the administrators of the school\n\nWhen school was in session, we had at least 3 broken chromebooks come in a week usually with broken glass on the screens because they dropped them or did some other stupid thing with them. I fixed them as fast as possible, and never got asked about my progress or anything by the High School tech team leaders, but AD was always pushing for more Chromebooks to the middle school. She would text me or ask me if I had any repaired Chromebooks on the daily, and would invite me into her office and discuss things relating to teachers needing tech help in the middle school. This annoyed me because she always took up my time when I could be fixing things instead of putting in a request like everyone else, but my dad said I was doing what I was supposed to be doing and she would always give me soda when I went into her office.\n\nOne day, AD texted me and asked me to come in her office because of a Chromebook problem she was having. I went over there and let myself in, she was on the phone with someone and talking about something unrelated when I came in. After she hung up the phone, this is the conversation that followed.\n\n**AD:** Okay, I am having a BAD day today.\n\n**Me:** Alright, what's going on?\n\n**AD:** This student was looking at spam advertisements on his computer! We saw them on there, how is he getting them?\n\nWe do not have any filtering software, just a firewall and Google settings to protect kids from seeing anything bad on the internet. They can see anything they want when they bring the Chromebooks home for the day.\n\n**Me:** Okay, well it could be that he got onto a website with advertisements that wasn't filtered through the firewall, or maybe it's a bad extension.\n\n**AD:** Oh my god you have to help me. That's not the only thing, look at this.\n\nShe takes the Chromebook and turns it to face the screen towards me. I see on there a Spotify album that the student had opened and was listening to in class. The album was \"Demon Days\" by Gorillaz.\n\n**AD:** How did he get onto this website!? He is listening to this album called DEMON DAYS by the Gorillaz! It's like.. Satanic!\"\n\nI had trouble keeping my sides from not launching into the next hemisphere. I love Gorillaz and used to listen to them all the time. I decided just to tell her what I was going to tell her originally, that I will fix this.\n\n**Me:** Okay, I will look at it for you. Maybe there is a bad extension or something and I can clean it up.\n\n**AD:** Oh, can you you? Thank you. These students are driving me crazy!\n\n**Me:** I used to listen to this band. It's not Satanic music, it's just electronica rock. \n\n**AD:** Oh, you used to listen to them? It's just very scary to see a child looking at these things. Can you please help me?\n\n**Me:** Sure, hand me the Chromebook and I will take care of it.\n\nNeedless to say, nothing was wrong with the Chromebook, all the student had done was go onto Spotify to listen to music. I took a look at it and uninstalled a few personal extensions that the student had installed, did an operating system wipe, and gave it back to her.\n\n**TL;DR** Student at a private Christian school was listening to the album Demon Days on his laptop. A tech team teacher thought it was satanic music and freaked out and enlisted my aid. I exorcised the Chomebook for her and it is now free of demons.",

        "text": "My company used to use a recruiting agency for finding IT people. (We still do, but we used to too.) As a result, not everybody we hired was capable of keeping up with the rest of the team, to put it nicely. This is a story of one such person. \n\nThis guy, who I’ll call $cable, was hired as a field tech for a remote region. With a very impressive resume professing over 20 years of IT experience, he should have been more than qualified to be a field tech. Sure, he couldn’t spell to save his life, despite claiming to have plenty of tech writing experience, but surely his technical skills were up to par!\n\nAlas, we found otherwise on one fateful day where I had to have him move a firewall from one modem to another. See, we tend to expand through acquisition, and on occasion we acquire a company that shares their office space with another company on certain days. We cannot work with this arrangement, so we tend to install all our own equipment in parallel: we order a dedicated internet circuit, new PCs, printers, phones, the whole shebang, then set it all up alongside existing equipment, using KVMs as necessary. This particular site I had learned of the shared arrangement too late, so I hadn’t had time to order a dedicated circuit quite yet and had to improvise. Being that $cable hadn’t yet been hired when this site needed to be set up, I ended up personally flying out and doing the initial setup. Since $otherCompany had a very basic setup, I ended up recreating their IP scheme on a separate VLAN on our gear and using our gear exclusively for the time being. Once our dedicated circuit was installed, all $cable would need to do is plug our gear into the new circuit, plug $otherCompany’s firewall back into their modem, move their switch back to their firewall, and all would be well. Simple!\n\nAs part of the original setup, each company did already have their own phones— ours were powered by a small 8 port PoE switch sitting on top of the rack, separate from the non-PoE switch for the rest of the gear, and $otherCompany’s were powered by power bricks connected to the individual phones. As part of the transition, we put in our own 48 port PoE switch, so we no longer needed the original PoE switch but I left it in place since it wasn’t technically ours (these split offices can be a bit messy in terms of equipment ownership). So after the transition, we had a 3U rack with the 8 port PoE switch sitting on top, our [very distinctive-looking silver switch that rhymes with $herHockey](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8zl8mr/if_it_sounds_impossible_its_probably_exactly_what/e2k3dee/?context=1) in the top U, our $herHockey firewall sitting right below that, and $otherCompany’s switch on the bottom. The two modems and $otherCompany’s firewall were mounted to the wall. \n\nMy conversation with $cable went something like this: \n\n$huta: so first off, move the WAN cable coming from our firewall into the new modem. \n\n$cable: which is our firewall?\n\n$huta: the silver $herHockey one. \n\n$cable: the one that says $GetNear?\n\n$huta: no, that’s $otherCompany’s, and it’s black. The silver one, in the rack. \n\n$cable: oh, got it. And which cable do I move again?\n\n$huta: the one plugged into the “internet” port. \n\n$cable: I don’t see an “internet” port. \n\n$huta: well, what do you see?\n\n$cable: there’s a whole bunch of cables coming out, and there’s like... 43 ports? Oh no wait, it says 48. \n\n$huta: that’s the switch. Look for the little silver box right under that. It should have 4 ports on it. \n\n$cable: I see a box with 8 ports?\n\n$huta: no, that’s the old PoE switch. We don’t need that. There should be nothing plugged into that. \n\n$cable: so I should unplug the cable I plugged in there?\n\n$huta: wait, what did you plug into that?\n\n$cable: the Internet cable?\n\n$huta: which Internet cable? We didn’t disconnect any internet cable yet. \n\n$cable: the $ISP guys gave me a new Internet cable!\n\n$huta: no, we don’t need that cable. There should be enough cables there already. Please unplug it. \n\n$cable: okay!\n\n$huta: now, do you see the little silver $herHockey box? The cables go in the back of it, not the front. \n\n$cable: oh yeah, I see it! The one mounted to the wall?\n\n$huta, getting frustrated: no, that’s $otherCompany’s firewall. Look on the rack, between the two switches. It’s sitting right on top of $otherCompany’s switch. \n\n$cable: oh yeah, okay, I got it. Now what do I do?\n\n$huta: find the cable going into the “Internet” port, trace it to the modem, and unplug it. \n\n$cable: but it goes to the switch?\n\n$huta: did you trace the one in the Internet port, or port 1? \n\n$cable: oh, I got the port 1. But it goes to port 48 on the switch?\n\n$huta: yes, as it should. Just leave that one alone. \n\n$cable: so I move the Internet cable to the new modem?\n\n$huta: correct. \n\n$cable: okay, done. Hey, it’s not working? It’s just showing a red light?\n\n$huta: give it some time to pick up the new IP address. \n\n$cable: it’s still broken. \n\n$huta: what did you plug it into? \n\n$cable: the modem on top of the rack. \n\n$huta: the modem is on the wall, not the rack. The only thing on top of the rack is the old PoE switch. We don’t need that. \n\n$cable: oh, ok. Done. Okay, now what?\n\n$huta: unplug $otherCompany’s switch from port 3 on our firewall and plug it into their firewall. \n\n$cable: which port should I plug it into?\n\n$huta: the one marked “LAN.”\n\n$cable: there’s none marked “LAN.”\n\n$huta: there should be. What are the ports labeled?\n\n$cable: they’re just labeled 1 through 8.\n\nAt this point, what should have been a 10 minute conversation had turned into an hour and ten minutes, and we were only barely closer to finishing than when we had started. And still, here we were discussing the useless PoE switch yet again! Beyond frustrated, I finally yelled at $cable the title of this post, much to the amusement of my colleagues. \n\nFortunately, that outburst seemed to finally startle him enough to start doing some critical thinking, and we got the 10 minute job done in *only* another 30 minutes. I reprogrammed our gear in 5 minutes, tested, and went home for the day, as at that point it was well past quitting time. \n\nAs for $cable? I’d love to be able to say that I was able to bring this incident, as well as countless others involving both myself and other colleagues, to my boss as reasons he shouldn’t be on our team. And I’d love to say those incidents did ultimately lead to his firing. And I can! He was let go about two weeks after this incident. Sometimes, there is indeed justice in this world. ",

You were right. They've been emailing me for months but I've been deleting the emails as I thought we moved this service to you. I just need to log in and pay the balance. Can you tell me the password?\n\n... Right now I'm just trying to write a pleasant email explaining that I couldn't possibly tell them the password for their account for a service I've never heard of with a company I've never heard of either. Suggestions are welcome!\n",

        "text": "Ok, I work with fairly unique and specialised technology and support a wide range of users but I need to be clear, phones are just not my thing.  I don't know much about them and am not employed to need to.\n\nIt was therefore something of a surprise when my manager decided to boast to the head of our HR that I could change his phone to sync to our company's exchange server - it was a few years ago now and for reasons I don't know our IT hadn't deployed it by default with the company phones leaving staff to sync via cables.  Of course, someone with a work phone could have just asked IT to set them up, another source of surprise when I was told to do so.\n\nAnyway, I popped up to HR and had a look.  It was an old iPhone (the second time I had even touched one) but I fumbled through the basic settings and found where to enter the Exchange server address and such.  The sync worked.\n\nI then gave it back to the manager and said it would sync automatically.  In fact I said it should ONLY be sync'ed remotely.  I said this several times, stressing the importance of the concept and that things could go wrong if he tried sync'ing using the computer.  I don't think I could have been clearer had I tattooed it onto his forehead.\n\nNow, as any of you real support people are already guessing, I got a call the next day that I had broken the phone and needed to fix it.  When I got there to check I found that all the emails and appointments were duplicated.  \n\nI asked when it had happened, and of course the answer was \"Just after I plugged it into the computer and sync'ed\".  \n\n\"But I said not to!\"\n\n\"Well yes, but I'm used to doing it this way so I thought I would try.  Now, since you broke everything how are you going to fix it?\"\n\nNow, the problem was not only duplicates, but as my city had recently experimented with daylight savings one if each appointment was 1 hour out.  And we are talking about a long term senior HR manager of a very large company, there were emails and appointments stretching back years, even months and years into the future, many required for formal records.  Thousands and thousands of them.  And it had gone both ways, the network account also had the duplicates so we couldn't just wipe the phone.\n\nIt was about that time that I remembered that I was not employed to handle such problems, that he had breached IT policy by making me do the job in the first place, and as HR manager he should be very aware of all of this.  He had also gone explicitly against my instructions.  So, in a moment of rare bravado I said \"Sorry, no idea, I'm not a phone guy.  Obviously.  I better get back to my real work.\"\n\nThe one person I feel sorry for was his secretary, who apparently spent the next two weeks manually checking everything and trying to clean the account up.  The manager was too worried about push back from IT to ask them for real help (who I expect could have fixed it in a day).\n\nI say apparently as I never spoke to him again.  My manager also never volunteered my phone services to anyone.  Personally I consider this a win.",

        "text": "Note: I know im not a great writer but every now and then i enjoy stretching that particular muscle, so bare with me and my less than amazing skill with written words.\n\nBackground: I work in a data center, we used to have a problem with customers removing machines from the floor so they stopped having to pay for the space, but leaving cables in place. This caused a lot of congestion and general annoyance for running new plans. From the customers point of view, why bother paying for the cables to be removed when we don't have anything there anymore. So a while back rules changed, now for any machine decommission we have to have a work order to remove all the cables attached to that machine. Generally works great until....\n\nCustomer submits a ticket, no idea why they thought this was a good idea, to remove all the cables from some machines they were decommissioning. So our team immediately spots the problem and goes back and forth with various levels of management and even the customer getting a LOT of CYA emails from various people saying essentially 'Do it'. \n\nInstead of removing the cables as requested it gets turned into a scream test (disconnect everything and see if anyone screams), everyone moves on with their night and all is quiet... for a few hours... then the screaming begins. \n\nThe techs, in their peculiar sense of humor disconnected the cables from the server side. This is relevant because the switch side of the cables are labeled 'port 1' 'port 2' etc with the switch name. While the server side the cable goes into onboard ethernet port 2 but is labeled prod (or something equally unhelpful for correlating to an actual port (for some reason we let customers give their ports fancy names that only ever mean anything to the people that have to log into the servers)). So when the screaming started we gave them an email with the equivalent of a blank look and said in order to reconnect the cables we would need a diagram, much frantic searching and waking up of people on the customers end and no diagram is forthcoming. So we had to brute force it, since nobody knew exactly what had previously been connected where, many techs were on a conference call with the customer and would go out in shifts (coming back to the office to charge their cell phones) and plug a cable into different ports until something came up and started working. \n\nThe ticket was worked around 9pm, the screaming started around 1:30 am, and everything was wrapped up by 5pm the next day.\n\nFor those that have not guessed what happened, the customer was decommissioning several virtual machines, someone saw the mandate for complete cable remove for decommissions and issued the ticket to remove all cables from all of their servers. Effectively bringing down their production network instead of the virtual machines that were being removed. \n\nThe result: we were congratulated, not just for the efficiency with which we brought their network down, but with how professional and how hard we worked with them to bring it back up. Amazingly the person who created the ticket retained their job. ",

        "text": "Hello guys!\n\nThis is my first post here and I'm excited that I finally have a story to share! I'm a long time lurker.\n\nI work for a third party IT company. We get a lot of service calls regarding printers. Mostly laser printers that we sell and install for clients ourselves, but today we got a call from a completely new client about a laser printer that had a \"paper jam\".\n\nOur boss goes on-site expecting to pull out an accordioned piece of paper from the fuser but he gets something ridiculous instead. The user admits he tried printing on to a **transparency film.** You know those things teachers would use on projectors and display onto whiteboards? Yea. That. The user thought he could put **plastic** through a **laser printer**. So the heat from the fuser just melted the plastic and it, well, *fused* itself around the fuser roller.\n\n*sigh*\n\nSo we tell him we don't know if we'll be able to fix it. We take it back to our office and begin taking it apart, but it's one of those cheap HP LaserJets meant for homes, not businesses. We didn't sell this to them.\n\nIt took is a good 20 minutes to take it apart. We had to completely dismantle the damn thing to get to the fuser.\n\nBefore we even started we knew the fuser was trashed and we couldn't find any of the parts online to replace it. So we told the client there wasn't anything we could do, but we'd be more than happy to direct them toward a nice inkjet for their transparencies and a better quality laser printer.\n\ntl;dr User tried printing a transparency film through a laser printer. That's a no-no.\n\nSo that's my first tech support tale!\n\nI took a picture of the fuser once I got it out. I noticed the rules said no image links so I didn't want to post right away. Just let me know if I can without breaking the rules!\n\nEdit: [Pics as requested](https://imgur.com/a/6RmKIns) (really hope this isn't against the rules)",

        "text": "/u/Tech_Witch’s story from earlier today about hot server rooms reminded me of my own ordeal. I worked for a surveillance system integrator as their lead architect, which means that I designed the surveillance systems on paper and then helped during the install. I also was brought in at times for advanced support. Some of our major customers were casinos, which we had 4 under active support contracts.\n\nSome important information for this story:\n\n\\-Casinos here get very large fines and have to shut down if the surveillance system is ever offline or cameras not recording.\n\n\\-By law, the surveillance system has to be on an airgap network to the rest of the casino so there is no remote monitoring or notifications.\n\n\\-Each camera is recorded by two completely different servers in different racks.\n\n\\-Each rack has separate A and B power, which is on different breakers and different UPSs for up time.\n\n\\-The amount of equipment in the server room has just about doubled from the initial install. There were about 30 Dell PowerEdge 2950 servers and about 14 SCSI connected 24 bay SATA storage arrays.\n\n\\-The server room has its own air conditioner, which was way oversized originally, but still sized properly after the new hardware was added.\n\nOne afternoon in 2008/2009, I get a phone call that the surveillance system is popping up errors from some of the servers. Multiple errors simultaneously always means a big problem so I’m in the car within seconds of hearing this, being about 10 minutes away. The director of surveillance then opens the door to the server room to look at the LCD screens on the servers and storage to read errors out to us on the phone, as he has been trained to do before. When he opens the solid door, heat billows out of the server room like he just opened a huge oven door. As soon as I hear this, I floor my car and go as fast as it can go, speed limit be damned, and get there within 5 minutes.\n\nAs soon as I get there, I take charge and start barking orders. I try to open the racks, but the metal racks are too hot touch. Every fan in every server is going full blast and I’ve noticed that I have lost one leg of power on one rack completely. Come to find out, since so much equipment has been added since the initial design, all of the racks are just about at their power maximum and we have already blown one breaker (the added fan power from spinning so fast was pushing it over the top). I send an employee to the power room with the instructions to find the popped breaker, flip it back over, and do the same for any future breakers that pop during this ordeal. I yell for maintenance to bring all of their carpet drying fans and as they are bringing them in, they also find work gloves which lets me get the doors off the front and back of the racks. The servers and storage arrays are all beeping from errors, and the temperature displayed on the front of the storage arrays said 99’C, which I’m guessing is the highest it would go. As I’m removing the doors, I notice one entire rack of servers go out. The guy in the electrical room has now been flipping breakers back on every 1-3 minutes now and it seemed that both the A and B legs blew at the same time before he could flip them back. Looking over, a small sign of relief as it was a rack of backup servers. The servers start powering back up and are reinitializing as we finally have all of the doors off and we have the carpet fans shooting directly into the racks at full speed. The noise of fans and air moving and heat was actually nauseating. I also have some of those carpet drying fans shooting air in and out of the room to try to normalize the temperature with the hallway.\n\nThe main server room for the casino is not too far away, so I yell for maintenance to find air ducting that I knew was being stored from the casino retrofit and pipe half of the AC from the other server room into this one just to get some cool air in there. By this point, I have the director of the casino, the director of surveillance, DBPR (Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation), FDLE (Florida Department of Law Enforcement), and countless other people I didn’t know asking me for status updates every minute. To the best of my knowledge at that point, every camera had been and still was recording on at least one server.\n\nI then sit down at a workstation and start doing a damage report. 3 servers completely offline, not bad considering. I DRAC into each them and they will not post at all. Breakers were still blowing, but at a slower rate. Things were calming down a bit as I started moving record jobs around to handle the 3 dead servers and the AC guys were on site to get the unit going again.\n\nThe final damage was 3 full servers and about 10-12 750GB hard drives. Since the storage arrays were all configured as RAID60 and the servers as RAID6, there was no data loss and we did not have a primary and backup go offline at the same time. The batteries for the RAID controllers in both the servers and storage arrays all had to be replaced as well since they had all swelled up. Overall, though, I really couldn’t have asked for a better outcome.",

My cousin and I are having trouble getting it to play. \n\n&gt;$me: Alright, what’s going on?\n\n&gt;$mother: Well, I’m in the list of voice memos, and I can see the ones that we made last night as well as the one I just made, but when I press the one that I just made it doesn’t play. \n\n&gt;$me: Are you pressing the play button?\n\n&gt;$mother: No, I don’t know how to do that. \n\n&gt;$me: Okay, first you need to tap on the file you want to play, so that it’s highlighted,-\n\n&gt;$mother: Yeah, I did that, but it’s not playing. Do I need to wait for you to come home so you can help me?\n\n&gt;$me: -now, look on the left of that highlighted file. Do you see a blue circle on the left of the file’s name, with a white triangle inside the circle? Looks kind of like a play button?\n\n&gt;$mother: (from the tone of her voice I can tell she doesn’t get it yet) Yeah, I see it. \n\n&gt;$me: Okay, I’m going to have to hang up first, to get it to work, but after I hang up, what I’m going to need you to do is highlight the file that you want to play, and then press that blue circle with the triangle in it. \n\n&gt;$mother: Okay $me, I’ll try that. \n\nI hang up the phone and go back to my textbook. Ten seconds later I get another call\n\n&gt;$me: Hey again.\n\n&gt;$mother: $me! You’re a genius!\n\nThe best part, to me, is the cousin (who was with her this entire time, and also has an iPhone) owns a private business where she works from her home computer, taking in a *lot* of money while doing so, and *she* wasn’t able to figure it out. I understand the older generation’s fear of playing around with (and thus learning about) new technology, but I didn’t realize that extended as far as being afraid to press what was, unmistakably, a play button",

        "text": "So, I used to work for a small MSP, managing small to medium sized networks in the area.  We had this one client whom we all referred to as \"The Dragon Lady\".  Now, DL was the most miserable person on the face of the planet, especially to her employees.  People lived in fear of this beast, and us lowly support technicians were not beyond her wrath.  Her primary form of communication was berating and belittling.  This is but one tale of my constant battle with the Dragon....\n\n::*Phone rings::*\n\n**Me**: \\[IT Company\\], this is Shanxtification, how may I help you.\n\n**DL:** What have you people done to my system, we are completely down!!\n\n*sigh...*\n\n**Me:** What do you mean you guys are down?  What exactly isn't working?  We haven't touched your systems today.\n\n**DL:**  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!  JUST FIX MY @!#@ SYSTEM NOW!\n\n**Me:** DL, I still don't know what exactly is wrong, can you explain to me what's happening?\n\n**DL:** YOU BROKE MY INTERNET!\n\n**Me:** Your internet is down? \n\n**DL:** OF COURSE IT IS, YOU @#$@#@! BROKE IT!  GET SOMEONE HERE NOW AND FIX IT!!\n\n**Me:** Ok, this could very well be an ISP issue, we need to contact them first before we dispatch anyone.\n\n**DL:** WE CANNOT BE DOWN THAT LONG!! GET OUT HERE AND FIX IT NOW!!\n\nAt this point, she was getting to hostile for my blood, and kept demanding onsite service without even trying to work with me over the phone, so I transferred her my boss (owner of the company) to calm her down while I went outside and sucked down a cigarette.  I get back from my much needed nicotine and my boss informs me that he has soothed the savage beast enough that she is will to work with me some more before we dispatch someone.....\n\n**Me:** Ok, so you're internet is down.  Has anything on your network changed today?  Did anyone plug something in that you know of?\n\n**DL:** Of course not!  The only thing that's anyone has done today is \\[ISP Company\\] came and replaced some of their equipment.\n\n**Me:**...........wait, do you know what they replaced?\n\n**DL:** The modem.\n\n**Me:** Did they verify internet access after they replaced the modem?\n\n**DL:**  Yes!  They said internet was working from the modem.  But nothing works on our network now!\n\n**Me:** Are they still there?\n\n**DL:** No, they left after replacing it.\n\n*Ugh......*\n\n**Me:** I think I know what's going on, but I need to contact them, can I call you back in a couple of minutes\n\n**DL:**  NO!  I don't believe you will call me back.  If you need to call them, then put me on hold!\n\n**Me:** Ok, I'll place you on hold.....\n\n*Proceed to put her on hold and call her every nasty thing I ever learned on the playground.....*\n\nA quick call to the ISP verified my suspicion that the new modem did not carry over their static IP address.  The phone call took all of 10 minutes.  I explained what happened to her after we verified her internet had been restored, and she basically just grunted, said \"Thanks\" and hung up.\n\nAhh, the joys of IT........",

        "text": "LTL; FTP\n\nI spent about 15 years of my adult life working for a survey company. A lot of that time was spent riding various boats/ships providing IT support and data processing for geophysical, bathymetric, and seismic surveying offshore. I was reminded of this story by the \"All Hot and Bothered in the Server Room\" story... \n\nI arrived to the ship to prepare for a bathymetric ( multibeam ) survey. We had a few technical problems before we were able to leave the dock. The first among those was that the ships controls were down ( throttle, steering, navigation, etc ), but that's a tale for another time. The 2nd problem was some sort of electrical fault that resulted in a very loud hum coming from the electrical room near the wheelhouse AND a complete lack of air conditioning on the upper deck. \n\nThe rest of the survey team was in a data collection shack on the back deck where geophysical surveys happened and I was in the multibeam lab... on the upper deck... For reasons unknown, the lights were also out, but all of the power outlets in the room had power. We reported the issue to headquarters and were told in no uncertain terms to \"go out and make it work\", so off to work we go. I spent several hours sitting in the multibeam lab running the bathymetric survey and running out to an air conditioned conex during line turns to cool off. The multibeam lab got up to about 115 degrees Fahrenheit. Our data collection computers were old Sun UltraSparc II's and they held up admirably... until they baked at 115 degrees for a couple of hours. After about 6 or 7 hours of work, the data collection machine and the file server both shutdown due to overheating. Somehow, the main office still wanted us to continue working. We eventually managed to convince them that trying to proceed would destroy $$$'s worth of computers and that the upper deck was no longer habitable for any amount of time. \n\nSurprisingly, none of the hardware was damaged in this adventure and we were able to go back to work about 24 hours later with a functional air conditioner.

        "text": "So here begins my story of a company I was at 2 years ago, and how their ignorance and greed almost cost them everything.\n\nSo I was the only on-site IT Support with a housing company for people with low-income or low living conditions. Pretty big office, 3 floors with around 50+ people working here. I'd say about 40 of them were incompetent (I had to teach experienced office workers and admins how to print, save files in network locations and rename files)\n\nYou can imagine the kind of place it is.\n\nAnyway, we have remote sites for the actual buildings we have our clients in (block of 100+ flats or so) and employees who work there, but limit it to 4 people per remote site. We use an external company for our network services, exchange, storage, CCTV, etc. Really good company, had a good relationship with the guys there and we always had transparency - anything to do with network passwords, playing with the server rack we have setup in the building, they'd never mind me touching things. Suffice to say I think they trusted me, but I earned that trust.\n\nThe company I worked for at the time had a really old Oracle virtualisation setup from a previous out-sourced network company that they paid bare minimal for. I was gobsmacked at the fact that they managed to run 37 VM's running Win10x64-Pro on a 128GB memory, 2GHz CPU, poorly-configured server. If we hit 40 VM's shit would start hitting the roof.\n\nI mean, they didn't even setup the email routing from the VM properly. They linked it through IMAP AND THEN to the exchange server publically. Why? don't ask. Don't know how it's possible, but they did. Why not just link it straight to the exchange server? It's all on the same network layer.\n\nSo, after finding this out for the first time I decided to contact our out-sourced company I have a good relationship with, for now I'll call them \"coolguys\". I told them how they were routing the emails on the VM's, and so they told me they'd been in contact with the previous network company about the virtualisation server, and since it was way out of warranty and we weren't their client, coolguys were able to take the  server into their own offices and set it up there (for a small fee, but they didn't mind, you'll see why), this was done on the weekend to prevent work downtime. I receive a call from the CTO of coolguys (yeah, this guy actually does support work too, actually works like a normal employee whilst doing important business sheninigans) How do I know this? I work with him now ;), but I can get into more detail about that in the comments if you have questions.\n\nNonetheless! He said on the phone that this virtualisation setup was horrendous and it needed a complete revamp. The migration wouldn't be hard whatsoever, in fact, the whole process wouldn't be due to the transparency we had and obviously snapshotting. He saw that 95-100% of the memory was constantly being used, the server simply wasn't built for this workload. VM's started to become HEAVILY sluggish. So, first thing we did was fix that email issue and linked it straight to our exchange server. All good on that side.\n\nSo, I was on call with the CTO (we'll call him coolboi), and throughout this whole process he had underlings to do the emails for us whilst he was on the phone with me, breaking down the whole process and how the server needed completely new hardware in order to keep up with the current usage. Since I was the only IT guy in the office, I handled printer cartridges, the finances for all hardware we had, etc. I had direct contact with the MD and FD because of this.\n\nBut boy, were the MD and FD ignorant. I broke down the whole situation for them bit by bit (they weren't too clued up about IT lingo but if said right they'll understand):\n\n&gt;\\&gt; Me: So, I was on the phone to coolboi and we spoke about the current situation with our Virtual Machines and the server running those VM's.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; FD: \\*glares intently\\* (FD is female, financial directors don't really talk until money is involved, you know the drill - also bare in mind our turnover was around 15 mill and RISING)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; MD: Okay, so what is the current situation?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; Me: We currently have 38 VM's running on a very old server which is almost at it's limit since the capacity of VM's on this server is 40. We definitely need to look into upgrading, especially considering we have new sites being built and therefore we'll have more remote users. As you know some people in the office even have VM's since they work at home on weekends or after working hours.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; FD: But we paid money for that server to run those VM's, so why can't we just keep using it as it is?\n\nAt this point I ALREADY wanted to launch a chair in her face or something, I don't condone violence but if you were just listening to me you wouldn't have had to ask me that question.\n\n&gt;\\&gt; Me: \\*repeats the capacity explanation\\*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; FD: Okay so then that means we can just pay for a small upgrade to 50 VM's?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; MD: (makes a good point for once) No but we can't just upgrade for an extra 10, what happens when we get even more employees? We are already over 40+ in this office alone. That's a no-go.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; Me: Considering that, I want to also add if you did upgrade to 50 VM's, you'll keep making payments to upgrade it every now and then and you'll end up spending more. (FD should've thought about that before anything)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; Me (again): I wanted to propose that we have a complete upgrade. Currently we're running on an old Oracle virtualisation setup, we'd need to move over to MS Hyper-V with much higher specs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; MD: Leave it to me, I'll talk to coolboi since this is important.\n\nSo after that interestingly and uncomfortably short conversation (I don't like how easily it was absorbed by them, usually a lot of ifs and buts) about 2 weeks pass by and I hear nothing about it. During this time I also found\n\nout that they are storing files locally on their VM's not on the network locations (which I myself and coolguys ALWAYS advise to do just incase for extra redudancy) and now, this is the part where you should know that MD and FD always use virtual machines; everyday after 6PM, they transfer files from the local office PC's to the VM, go home and continue working. I brushed this off as they don't usually do this, must've had their reasons. Another week passes by and I still haven't heard nothing about this virtualisation upgrade, so I get more focused on it because it's so important otherwise we're going to drop our workload tenfold and potentially lose files.\n\nSo I recieve a call from a remote site with a woman who is using her VM, let's call her mrstootsie (on the spot names, no relevance at all)\n\n&gt;\\&gt; mrstootsie: Hi! &lt;me&gt; I'm having slight issues with my VM, I can't get onto the shared drives, but before getting hit down I noticed that LOADS of accounting folders started appearing inside Z: server\\\\Portfolio  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; Me: Okay that's really odd, I'm going to connect to your VM so you'll be kicked out for a minute just so I can look.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; mrstootsie: Sure thing!\n\nMfw I login to her VM and find everything is corrupted, I literally, mean, everything. Even opening a word shortcut would return a registry error. I instantly call up coolboi's mobile cos this shit's important.\n\n&gt;\\&gt; Me: Hey man, look something weird is--  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\&gt; coolboi: I know what you're about to tell me, you see all data on the VM's corrupting. The only effected shared drive is server\\\\Portfolio\n\nI realised, at this very moment, my FD and MD are about to recieve the biggest shit scare of their life. Data ranging from invoices to bills, to business transactions, investments, shares.\n\ncoolboi actually warned us of this weeks prior in a Skype conversation with my manager:\n\n&gt;\"the delays between the two remote places will never work with opening large or any file, alot of data corruption will start appearing especially since we are way over capacity and need to get this upgraded ASAP.\"\n\nSo to run down before shit hits the fan, server\\\\Portfolio is the most used by everyone in the company and is always active with file changes, renames, new files, etc which is why it's the only one effected.\n\n&gt;Me: Yeah, nice! One thing though, can you check server\\\\Portfolio for any accounting folders?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;coolboi: Don't fuck with me right now &lt;me&gt;, I am seeing the whole of server\\\\Accounting files and folders inside portfolio, that's around 10TB transfer.\n\ncoolboi begins to check the actual accounting drive itself and finds NOTHING since it was MOVED not COPIED. I wonder who did this?\n\nSo he did some digging and found out it was FD. Surprise! I forgot to mention at this point, in those weeks, we had about 15 new employees each with VM's, which puts us to way over 40 VM's and maximum server capacity.\n\nFD decided to move everything from accounts to portfolio, which bang, somehow, don't know how, kicked off the whole corruption. I think the server was handling too much r/W'ing but this wouldn't have happened if she did this in the office with a direct connection to the main network. She did this, on her VM. I still don't know to this day why she did it.\n\nI went upstairs to tell MD and FD the situation, and panic broke loose. They started ordering admins to get every bit of financial paper before I could even mutter the words \"Don't worry though, we have a backup from 2 days ago\".\n\nAt this point there was so much going on I couldn't even get to talk to them, they weren't listening. Baring in mind, they were warned weeks prior of this happening.\n\ncoolboi comes in to our office in a meeting with myself, MD, FD and my manager. He has everything, complete list of every single component for a server that can manage 70+ virtual machines with much higher storage capacity on flash storage, I really pushed on moving away from HDD's for VM's. He gave pricing, dates, future expectations, and on top, the support for the server will remain 100% free. Nonetheless it all came to £8,000 for a whole new virtualisation setup. DEDICATED. Thought that was a steal.\n\nMD and FD, in summary, denied the whole thing. Stupidly enough after that whole experience, didn't feel the price was justified. But then 3 days later spend £20,000 on buying gifts for the guys on the 3rd floor, go on holiday every two weeks and buy themselves the most expensive clothes and brands you'd not even think they'd be buying.\n\n***TL;DR - FD caused all VM's to corrupt and a whole shared drive to completely corrupt which had all finances and important business data that should not be getting lost and shouldn't have been there in the first place. Still won't upgrade the virtual server.***\n\nAfter that I left the company about a month later. Don't know what's going on there.\n\nEdit: Won't let me add a long flair :(",

This is not our first laser cutter but our old epilog was pretty much dead at this point.  \n\nOur previous workflow was corel draw and then print to the epilog using a special print driver. The glowforge on the other hand uses a web interface that accepts several file types but not corel's .cdr filetype. So my current workflow has been corel to .SVG . Well yesterday I found out that trusting the output file was a bad idea. In the web interface most things are drawn kinda small because all you are doing is positioning them.

        "text": "Had a chat with an old colleague yesterday and I was reminded of this tale.   \nThis takes place back in 2013. I had finally had it with the sleazy attitude at the fix-it shop (another tale for another time) and gotten a job at a server monitoring and maintenance firm. Not exactly what I studied at university but at least it beat flipping burgers like some of my former classmates were doing at the time. I was still very much a bumbling greenhorn scrambling to stretch what little of my university education that could be called server knowledge to fit a job description focused exclusively on server knowledge when this happened.   \n\n  \nIt’s mid July and the heat has drivven us unlucky few not on vacation to beg, borrow and steal every fan we can get our hands on to keep the office somewhat bearable. Well there i was, sitting in my fortress of fans when the monitoring software threw up a big ALERT notice. One of the 24/7 uptime servers we monitored for a local client was throwing a hissy fit and not responding to ping. After a quick round of rock, paper, scissors that I lost I had to leave my precious cool office and head out to see what was causing the server to misbehave.   \n\n  \nOne car ride across town later and I found myself at a small building in the business park just outside town. I was met by a security guard that told me he had been called out by the client ITVP to let me in, since everyone working there was on vacation. He let me into the building and after some searching we found the server room, complete with a door that wouldn’t be out of place in a high-security prison.   \n\n  \nWhen the guard opened the server room door it was clear as day why the server was acting up. The wave of heat that billowed out from the server room was like opening an oven on full blast. The cooling system had clearly taken a vacation with the rest of the employees and left the poor server stewing in its own heat.  \nAfter disabling the door alarm and helping me prop up the door with a chair the guard left in search of someplace cool and I dug in to try and coax the cooling system to life again. My very basic troubleshooting of course couldn’t cut it and I resorted to plan B: moving the few portable fans in the foyer to the server room to blow out the heat. \n\n\nThe fans were the kinda expensive (back then) rotating tower type that blew out air in a vertical line instead of the usual circular fan head. First fan in place and I quickly realised this was going to be a uphill battle. The fan didn’t as much blow out the heat as just churn it around. As I was moving in the second fan my hands were already slick with sweat and slipping on the smooth plastic covers. I must have bumped the chair holding the door when I was wrangling in the second fan and trying to not bash it up or drop it, because when I managed to get the fan into the server room I heard the door slam shut and lock behind me. And the only one around able to open was the guard, who was out of earshot somewhere else in the building.  \n\n  \nWell, shucks.   \n\n  \nLuckily enough I had cellphone signal in the server room so I called one of my coworkers at the office and told him what had happened. After the laughter had stopped he promised to head over to find the guard and tell him to let me out. It was only after I ended the call I realised something bad. The heat was building again, slowly but surely. The fans I plugged it wasn’t up to scratch cooling down a open foyer, not to mention a closed server room, and I made a rough guess how long the server would survive in the building heat. The number I came up with was not a not very reassuring number.  \n\n  \n**T MINUS 60 MINUTES TO COMPLETE SERVER MELTDOWN.**  \n\n  \nI shifted the fans to blow directly towards the server and put them on the highest setting. Nothing more I could do now but wait for my coworker to drive over and let me out.   \n\n  \n**T MINUS 30 MINUTES TO COMPLETE SERVER MELTDOWN.**  \n\n  \nI checked my phone. 30 minutes had passed since I spoke to my coworker and he promised to fetch the guard. I was sweating all over now and wished i had brought water with me. In a effort to cool down somewhat I stripped down to my underwear, as my shirt and pants were already soaked enough with sweat that I imagined I could squeeze it out. Bra and panties are pretty much the same as a bikini, right? And bikinis are summerwear, right? So I was still dressed decently for summer, at least in my mind.  \n\n  \n**T MINUS 20 MINUTES TO COMPLETE SERVER MELTDOWN.**    \n\n  \nI felt I couldn’t wait any longer. I called the office and got another coworker on the line. I asked if we could break the 24/7 uptime and shut the server down instead of having it melt itself, and me with it, to slag. He said he would text me the commands I needed to gracefully shut it down and  he would square it with the client later. \n\n  \n**T MINUS 15 MINUTES TO COMPLETE SERVER MELTDOWN.**  \n\n  \n*PLING*  \nI grabbed my phone and hastily read through the message. There was a lot of commands needed to shut everything down without the server loosing its mind completely. I propped my phone up near the keyboard and went to work.\n\n  \n**T MINUS 10 MINUTES TO COMPLETE SERVER MELTDOWN.**  \n\n  \nI must have looked like every teenage nerd’s dream when my coworker and the guard eventually opened the door. There I was, wearing only my underwear, glistening with sweat and smashing in the last commands to gracefully shut down the server before it cooked itself to death. \n\n\n**SERVER SHUTTING DOWN. MELTDOWN AVERTED.**  \n\n\nMy coworker later told it took so long because he had to search for the guard. Apparently he had, after searching for almost 20 minutes, found the guard asleep in one of the few offices that had a ceiling fan installed. I was too wrung out to give him a good earful so I just downed the bottle of water my coworker gave me and got dressed again. Once back at the office I was told to take the rest of the day off to recover from my ordeal (and for my coworkers to laugh at the newbie behind her back I guess).\n\n**Edit**: Fixed some spelling errors.\n\n**Edit 2**: Thanks for the gold!",

        "text": "this happened about an hour ago. I shall be me, and the user will be Edith.\n\nMe: Hi, this is silvryphoenix. \n\nEdith: Hi, i';m having trouble printing from the bypass tray for a will im trying to print onto engrossment paper. It used to be that I could put the paper in either way into the bypass tray and it would print. Now, it will only print if i put it in with the short end first.\n\nMe: ok...so does it print the document ok?\n\nEdith: Yes. It's just really weird that it used to accept the paper no matter which way we put it into the bypass tray. But now i've got to put it into the tray with the short end first.\n\nMe: So there is no problem with the end product. It prints out fine?\n\nEdith: Yes, it prints out fine. It's just really weird how it's changed from accepting the paper both ways to just one now,\n\n\\*Me, internally\\*: why is she ringing up?\n\nMe, externally: Edith, this isn't a technical support issue. you are able to print ok. There is nothing technically wrong with the printer, aside from a minor issue with the bypass tray which you've already worked out. I deal with stuff that doesn't work, and your printing works.\n\nEdith: I know, it's just weird that \\*repeats herself again. i get the impression she was trying to be helpful in reporting something that she thinks may become a problem in the future, and also wanted me to join her in saying it was weird\\*\n\nMe: Edith, again, this is not something I deal with. Everything works. I do not need to get involved.\n\nEdith: Ok, thanks \n\nI'm a bit taken aback that she would try to report an issue that wasn't an issue. ",

        "text": "This was my first IT/tech support job, about 10-11 years ago now. This is also my first actual post here so if you must murder me, be gentle.\n\nI was working night shift for the company next door to Hell. Well, I say working, but I don't think I'd had any actual work in about 45 minutes so I was mostly routing around the company's not very well configured proxies. Which probably meant I was in the perfect mood to receive the one call I can still remember in particular today for its overall general weirdness. I have never had a call like it since. I also may or may not have foregone the booze when I got home.\n\n$Customer: Are your computers offline?  \n$me: Um. No, but it sounds like you might be having an issue. What's wrong?  \n$Customer: Oh, nothing big really. Just my computer hasn't been able to turn on all day and wanted to make sure there wasn't some kind of outage.  \n$Me: Well, I've got good news and I've got bad news. The good news is when we do fix you, you'll be able to rejoin the electronic hivemind. Of course the bad news is we first have to fix you. Now, then. Exactly where am I sending the technician with your new power supply and motherboard?\n\nTo this day I cannot possibly tell you how it is I managed *not* to say something to the effect of \"resistance is futile\".\n\nEdit: I fail at formatting. sorry for the wall of text.",
