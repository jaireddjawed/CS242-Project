        "text": "Has there been any researchbsurrounding Confederate attitudes towards the American Revolution and Founding? Or how Southern attitudes to enslavement changed from 1776 to 1861? I got interested in the subject a few weeks ago, and, honestly, was expecting to see members of the Confederacy government predominately view themselves as a *continuation* of the Founding. Yet, looking at the primary sources, many of the leading Confederates seem to openly *mock* and/or *attack* much of the Declaration of Independence or Constitution. (Particularly the notion that \"all are created equal\")\n\nI'm sure many people here are familar with the \"Cornerstone Speech\" by Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens in terms of the Lost Cause and the mythology that the Confederacy wasn't fighting over slavery.  It's been extensively quoted in terms of this paragraph:\n\n&gt; Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. \n\nYet I haven't seen many comments on the *rest of the speech*... which also makes a significant amount of claims — in a \"history of ideas\" way — that I haven't seen mentioned or analyzed by essentially any political scientists, historians, or commentators, but are in my mind very interesting in terms of current politics and debates surrounding the Founding.\n\nWhile it's often assumed that the Confederates saw themselves as successors to the American Revolution, it appears to me - and I might be wrong here - that many of them *openly* contested both the Declaration of Independence and parts of the Constitution and/or saw their ideals in *contradiction* to it as well.\n\nFor example, the *New York Times* reports Stephens [stating:](https://www.nytimes.com/1861/03/25/archives/the-starvation-humbug-again.html)\n\n&gt; In the fourth place, and this is the principal and most important point of all -- we have settled, and, I trust, settled forever, the great question which was the prime cause of our separation from the United States -- I mean the question of African Slavery. -- ***The old Constitution set out with a wrong idea on this subject; it was based upon an erroneous principle; it was founded upon the idea that African Slavery is wrong, and it looked forward to the ultimate extinction of that institution. But time has proved the error, and we have corrected it in the new Constitution.*** We have based ours upon principle of the inequality of races, and the principle is spreading -- it is becoming appreciated and better understood; ***and though there are many, even in the South, who are still in the shell upon this subject, yet the day is not far distant when it will be generally understood and appreciated -- not only in the South, but everywhere else. The world is rapidly progressing in its views on this subject, and in a very few years we may witness great changes in respect to this institution.***\n\n&gt; The new [Confederate] Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions—African slavery as it exists among us—the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson, in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the \"rock upon which the old Union would split.\" He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted.\n\n&gt; ***The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old Constitution were, that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with; but the general opinion of the men of that day was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away... Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error.*** It was a sandy foundation, and the idea of a Government built upon it—when the \"storm came and the wind blew, it fell.\"\n\n&gt; Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. ***This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth. This truth has been slow in the process of its development, like all other truths in the various departments of science. It is so even amongst us. Many who hear me, perhaps, can recollect well that this truth was not generally admitted, even within their day. The errors of the past generation still clung to many as late as twenty years ago.*** Those at the North who still cling to these errors with a zeal above knowledge, we justly denominate fanatics. All fanaticism springs from an aberration of the mind; from a defect in reasoning. It is a species of insanity. One of the most striking characteristics of insanity, in many instances, is, forming correct conclusions from fancied or erroneous premises; so with the anti-slavery fanatics: their conclusions are right if their premises are. They assume that the negro is equal, and hence conclude that he is entitled to equal privileges and rights, with the white man.... I recollect once of having heard a gentleman from one of the Northern States, of great power and ability, announce in the House of Representatives, with imposing effect, that we of the South would be compelled, ultimately, to yield upon this subject of slavery; that it was as impossible to war successfully against a principle in politics, as it was in physics or mechanics. That the principle would ultimately prevail. That we, in maintaining slavery as it exists with us, were warring against a principle-a principle founded in nature, the principle of the equality of man. The reply I made to him was, that upon his own grounds we should succeed, and that he and his associates in their crusade against our institutions would ultimately fail. The truth announced, that it was as impossible to war successfully against a principle in politics as well as in physics and mechanics, ***I admitted, but told him it was he and those acting with him who were warring against a principle. They were attempting to make things equal which the Creator had made unequal.***\n\nIt's interesting that Stephens is saying here that the \"errors of the past [Founding] generation still clung to many as late as twenty years ago [1841]\". Implying that even many Southerners were aware of the contradictions of continued enslavement at the time of the Founding - and that white Southern attitudes towards slavery apparently transformed from a \"necessary evil\" in 1789 to a positive good by the time of 1861. Notably, even Jefferson, who would seemingly be one of the Founders that would be quotable by the Confederate government, is seemingly seen by Stephens as more of an *enemy* than friend. Other leading quotes from officials in the Confederate administration make similar negative quotes on the Founding - including even a half-hearted wish that they remained in the British Empire - describing the \"old Constitution\" and the \"Declaration\" as \"the Founders mistakes\" and \"rejection of the natural order\". Many even mock figures such as John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, *et al.*.\n\nThis definitely wasn't what I was expecting going into the primary literature.\n\nIs there any good resources on:\n\n* Did Southern attitudes on race and slavery evolve between 1776 and 1861?\n* Did the Confederates view the American Founders and documents positively?  Many seem to criticize the original Founding, and particularly figures such as Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and, strangely enough, Thomas Jefferson. \n\nIs Stephens being hyperbolic here? Or was the \"prevailing view\" at the Founding truly that:\n\n&gt; that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with; but the general opinion of the men of that day was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away.",

Within this podcast the guests describe a very different version of Stalin than what I’ve come to understand through my own research, and of course popular knowledge. \n\nThey present obscure evidence of how the information we have on Stalin as a megalomaniac totalitarian is actually unreliable western propaganda. I understand the truth is always complicated, but I have a hard time coping with this kind of fallacious needle nosing about how this or that is actually propaganda. At the end of the day all accounts of events are to varying degrees propaganda, open to the possibility of corruption and bias. Although the introduction of uncertainty to any particular historical event is a possibility and sometimes necessary, it a dangerous one that can lead self proclaimed “truth seekers” to belief utter nonsense. \n\nWhat I’m asking, specifically, is has anybody heard this podcast that can refute/confirm the claims it makes, or generally refute/confirm the common claims for Stalinist policies and/or the “necessity” of the terror he incited? \n\nAnother problem I have that is more broad and insidious is how to deal with the reality that someone can always provide counter “evidence” to any narrative, and label anything as “propaganda,” and how to get an eye and ear for when a claim seems spurious and unreliable.",

At this point, the damage done to the country and the civilian deaths were relatively low compared to what would come in the following years. It would be fair to say that up until late 2003/early 2004, the operation was a success. Even if the pretext for it was wrong, the US removed a brutal dictator and had an actual opportunity to transform not only Iraq, but also the entire region into more democratic and progressive systems. So what exactly went wrong from there on? Why has the opposite happened? I don't want to argue about whether the war itself was wrong or not, I'm just trying to understand why what the US attempted did not work, even though the opportunity was there at one point.",

        "text": " \n\nJust what the hell is North Korea, exactly? Outsiders have been trying to figure out for many decades just what their deal is. How does the Kim regime and military elites want their own people to view about themselves and the world, and how do they want the outside world to view them? Their actions don't seem to match their records, and their records don't seem to match their actions, either. It's quite bizarre, even to South Koreans.\n\nBefore I take on these questions based on my aforementioned view in the post's title, I would like to give some background information as to how I got to making this post in the first place and why I think this sort of discussion is desperately needed. I am myself quite the history buff and geek ever since my high school years, even though I am not and never was a History major in university. I just have an innate desire to make sense of the world. There's a saying that learning an unbiased and objective history of humankind in all sorts of distant kingdoms, empires, and hegemonic states/republics can help you understand and help you prescribe solutions for the the world in present times. Well, as someone of East Asian descent I just wanted to make sense of the crazy tensions between the 3 great powers of the Asian sphere: the Korean peninsula, China, and Japan. I especially wanted to know why Korea is the way it is now, and how it got to be, tragically, divided in half(much like a caged tiger), for many decades; and just why no one, even South Koreans themselves, seems to really understand the Kim regime and its people. It's kinda like how when you see your neighbor next door trying to arm themselves to the teeth and installing all these military grade security systems in their house in a completely safe neighborhood. The first thing that comes to mind would not be how I should stop this guy from being a nut. It would instead be on \"how this guy thinks.\" The same applies for such an isolated country like North Korea. Knowing this can help the world leaders in South Korea and the United States on how to best reunify the country with the least amount of misery and death.\n\nAnyways, back to the main point of this post. Now, I share the perspective that Korea is actually a hereditary, far right national socialist state with Korean characteristics/traditions. However, I just want to provide an overview of the few school of thoughts out there, with regard to what North Korea actually is, and there are 5 to be exact:\n\n1.) The traditional conservative view is that North Korea is just merely a Stalinist-Communist holdover from the Soviet era. I understand why a lot of casual viewers of mass media may fall into this perspective, because the whole North Korean propaganda schtick with the red and sickle symbolisms, and left-wing style rhetoric like \"Democratic People's Republic\" and \"the masses\" really does make it seem North Korea is like a Stalinist-Communist regime. Actually, many South Koreans who are just casual watchers of their own mass media(KBS, Yonhap News, SBS, etc.) tend to hold this view.\n\n2.) The neoliberal/neoconservative view is that North Korea is a state that has just degraded into a rogue state trying to one day, in their minds, proliferate their nuclear arsenal to the point where they can gain the upper hand over the United States, in order to gain the sovereignty that they desire. The communist style propaganda, the massive military parades, and the like are just a means to an end, in order to shore up support from North Korean citizens over its Songun \"Military first\" policies needed to build more nukes.\n\n3.)The leftist and liberal view is that North Korea is simply just a continuation of Confucian dynastic traditions from way before Japanese occupation, and that it is neither Communist nor Fascist. Their rationale is that all they ever wanted was to be left alone, and that had the United States not carpet-bombed the hell out of the northern part of the peninsula, then the Kim regime might have took a milder form of dictatorship, akin to post-70s North Vietnam's or East Germany's. This may seem like the most logical explanation, but there is a major flaw to this line of thinking, which I will get to after this overview.\n\n4.)The permanent bunker Fascist state view(My View): Not long ago, I have stumbled upon and read B.R Myers' \"The Cleanest Race\" on North Korea actually being an Imperial Japanese fascist holdover from the 30s and 40s. Now, B.R Myers seems to have no leanings in the academic world of Korean history and literature. He just simply told it like it was, in terms of the order of events starting from the Japanese annexation of Korea. His rationale was this: The Japanese Imperial government stationed in Korea at the time deliberately brewed up race-based Korean nationalism, in order to establish a kinship between Koreans and the Japanese. Ironically enough, a lot of the intellectuals that helped out with Kim Il Sung's propaganda machine were actually pro-Japanese collaborators who decided to then turn this pro-Japanese Korean nationalism into a purely Korean version. Much of the iconography meant to glorify the Kim family was actually based on Japan's own propaganda of venerating Emperor Hirohito. Yes, I am not making this shit up. After reading this really groundbreaking and impartial analysis of North Korea, I've had severe cognitive dissonance(for a few days) as someone who is actually of Korean descent. The hard hitting and cold truth is that many literate middle and upper class Koreans at the time all felt this collective shame for supporting Imperial Japan upon their defeat in WW2, so they all felt like they wanted to settle the score, save face, and feel better about themselves as proud Koreans. Out of the 5 perspectives, I would say this holds the most weight and validity, due to B.R Myers' intensive research on what \"actually happened\" all those decades ago from Korea's liberation to the start of the Korean War. As a Korean, I am very much aware that Korean history researched by Korean academics themselves tend to muddy the waters and to steep itself in nationalism. His approach was a way of cutting through all the noise, and focus purely on the truth of the chronology of events that had occurred in the peninsula. It was certainly quite the plot twist in terms of truly changing what we already had believed to be true about North Korea. It's quite fitting, because Korean thrillers and mysteries are also filled with plot twists and irony.\n\n5.) Finally, the bleakest of all perspectives is that North Korea is just a straight up hypocritical racketeering mafia state bent on its own survival. This perspective is mainly held by independent journalists of various political stripes that mainly try to expose corruption in a lot of 3rd world countries(kleptocracies, oligarchies, and the like). All the propaganda the state is trying to spew to the public and to the outside world are merely political manipulations designed to cover up for the corruption of its military elites. Much like the 2nd perspective in that it is a rogue state trying to survive, only this time it manipulates geopolitics in a way that serves their own monetary interests in underground industries. If this is to be true, then this is truly a bleak scenario in which the Kim regime and its military elites are guaranteed its longevity unless it is overtaken violently by inside or outside forces.\n\n...\n\nNow, with all that out of the way, I just want to offer my counter arguments to all of them and to offer further supporting arguments to the 4th view(my view):\n\n1.) Contrary to popular belief, Kim Il Sung was not socialist in the Marxist-Leninist sense. In fact, he wasn't really educated or literate about Marxist-Leninist intellectualism himself. He dropped out of school entirely when he was 16 or 17, in order to involve himself in resistance movements against the Japanese. It wasn't until he was picked by the Soviets to lead the Northern half, after making a name for himself as a guerilla fighter against Japan. He had only implemented the red iconography and leftist style propaganda, in order to provide cover for himself so that his administration can start nation building without the Soviets butting in. The real purpose of his propaganda was purely for fascist, race-based reasons, which I will get into later when I get to B.R Myers' perspective.\n\n2.) It's not necessarily true that North Korea seeks power or hegemony over United States, or that it has the intention of using the nuclear weapons. The Kim regime, unpredictable and irrational as they seem, will not actually use a nuke themselves; because it knows it would spell the end for their regime if they do.\n\n3.) Yes, it is true that Kim Jong Un is a rational actor. He does, indeed, care about the survival of his regime. It's also true that North Koreans do want their sovereignty and they do want to be left alone. However, it is not a Confucian state or a continuation of previous Korean kingdoms, by any means. The fascist style propaganda and iconography of the Kim family intended to portray motherly figures, not fatherly figures, which is the basis for an Confucian based authoritarian state. They are shown to be these really feminine caretaker figures. If paintings showing men around the same age laying their heads on Kim's bosom for comfort and warmth, then I don't know what is a more motherly undertone than that. If that wasn't prove enough, just look at how dozens and dozens of young kids in uniforms rush to feel his embrace every time he goes up to a podium to commence a massive speech.\n\n4.) Now, onto my view. To reiterate from my overview of this perspective, pro-Japanese collaborators were hired by none other than Kim Il Sung himself to create his propaganda machine for him. Koreans, during the Japanese annexation, were actually incentivized to be proud of their own Korean race, in order for the Imperial government to establish a kinship between Koreans and Japanese. A lot of the literate middle and upper class Koreans felt this collective shame for supporting Japan upon their defeat in WW2, so they would often entrench themselves in these intellectual enclaves to create their own unique forms of pure Korean ethno-nationalism, thereby kicking the Japanese out of it. Much of modern day North Korean propaganda comprises of dehumanizing Western adversaries, mainly United States, as these big nosed tainted people conspiring to taint their brethren in the South and to ultimately their own homeland and racial stock. This strongly resembles a lot of the iconography depicted in Nazi German propaganda whereas they depicted Jews as scheming individuals out to taint the German race, traditions. and sovereignty. The difference between North Korean fascism and German fascism is that Korean fascism is more of an inward kind, whereas German fascism was expansionist(e.g.. Lebensraum). The Kim family's version of ethno-fascism is one where because the Korean race is too pure, it had been bullied for its kindness and innocence. Therefore, Koreans need a motherly figure to look out for them. By the way, if anyone is arguing that the Kims are considered as fatherly leaders/generals, they are not. In fact, it's actually a mistranslation of a lot of Western documentaries. The word \" 어머 \" means mother or relating to motherly characteristics.\n\n5.) Now, I don't entirely discredit the mafia state theory; but I do think money is needed anyway to fund their nuclear operations and to just simply feed themselves. By \"they\", I mean a lot of the military elites. I think that their dealings with underground industries are just a means to an end, in order to legitimize their fascist state. The reason why I say \"out of necessity\" is that they lost much of the aid and revenue after the fall of the Soviet empire in the early 90s. They simply are just broke as hell, and need to find ways to fund their state, even if it resorts to dealing with the criminal world. By and large, I don't think that these dealings are truly corrupting military elites(maybe some). If this racketeering corruption theory were really true, then why didn't the Kim regime just collapse during the Great famines in the 90s? Surely, the military elites and common class soldiers would have to put a bullet on them in rebellion out of desperation for better material well being. Plus, a kleptocratic mafia state implies a materialist mindset, which fascism uses does not subscribe to. The difference between fascism and communism is really this. Communism offers improvements in material well being for the \"masses.\" Fascism just straight up offers struggle and strive in both good and bad times, in order to strength the sovereignty and purity of their state and race, respectively.\n\n......\n\nI am curious as to what my fellow Redittors think is the most accurate perspective on North Korea, and why the \"bunker Fascist state\" theory would be wrong.",

I'd guess Yoda and ET were big turning points.\n\nIn *Out of the Silent Planet* (1938), C.S. Lewis has an intelligent Martian species the Hrossa, who are kinda like giant otters, and at times the protagonist finds them as cute as puppies.  (It also has an early description of the uncanny valley:\n\n&gt;[The feelings of discomfort around the hrossa] arose when the rationality of the hross tempted you to think of it as a man.  Then it became abominable - a man seven feet high, with a snaky body, covered, face and all, with thick black animal hair, and whiskered like a cat. But starting from the other end you had an animal with everything an animal ought to have - glossy coat, liquid eye, sweet breath and whitest teeth - and added to all these, as though Paradise had never been lost and earliest dreams were true, the charm of speech and reason. Nothing could be more disgusting than the one impression; nothing more delightful than the other.\n\nMaybe Woola in the John Carter series also might count, although if I remember correctly, Carter always finds Woola kinda gross but he's loveable for his personality, not his looks.",

We take far fewer refugees than other major European countries. This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s\"*.\n\nThis is part of the speech Lineker responded to from UK Home Secretary, Suella Braverman:\n\n&gt;*\"Our asylum system has been overwhelmed. If you come here illegally, you will not be able to stay. You will be removed or detained, sent back to your home country if safe, or a safe third country like Rwanda... It is not fair that people can travel through a string of safe countries and then come to the UK illegally can jump the queue and game our system... Enough is enough. We must stop the boats.\"*\n\nI describe the policy and plans as anti-humanitarian as the bill has been presented as explicitly with the intention of going against the European Convention of Human Rights, the United Nations refugee and asylum laws, and the advice of charities such as Amnesty International and International Rescue Committee UK . As Braverman stated, she was “*unable to make a statement*” that the Illegal Migration Bill’s provisions are “*compatible with the Convention rights.*” I do not believe it is inaccurate to regard the action as in opposition to humanitarian ideas of safeguarding non-nationals from harm, detention without trial, the suspicion of guilt on the basis of ethnic otherness, and so on.\n\nSo I am simply curious of what r/modernhistory and r/DebateHistorians think regarding this subject of controversy.

I mean,  well,  its a series afterall, but still in reality that Mr. Magellan  went from his home country Portugal (which he served very well and loyal  until then) to the king of Spain and that king was quite open to the  idea to give a lot of money to a foreigner, for a discovery of an  alternative passage. So that makes it look quite important in reality as  well.\n\nBut looking at maps the  difference between the Strait of Magellan and Drake Passage doesnt seem  to be all that impressive, especially not if you are already sailing for  multiple months anyway, if not for years.\n\nI  also couldnt find any informations on german and english wikipedia or  even google,  besides obvious facts like \"well the straits connects both  oceans\", aha so does the Drake Passage.\n\nWas  it because of the very strong east winds on drake passage ? Were winds  already so much lower at the end of the magellan strait ?\n\nFrom  what I could read the straits usage after the discovery wasnt so high  anyways, but the search for such an strait rather was, I just wonder  why. Or were they rather on a search for an passage much more north,  with even better weather conditions to sail through ?",
