        "text": "Today the Charleston Church Shooter was sentenced to 9 consecutive life sentences w/o parole at the state level after being sentenced to death federally a few months ago. With this, there is an interesting contrast between the two \"options\" for how a criminal can be sentenced when the crime is that bad. What are the pros and cons of the two? All I ever hear about is the cost of the two, but surely there's solid support for both options beyond just money. Even things like a sense of vengeance.\n\n[Link to story.](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/10/us/dylann-roof-guilty-plea-state-trial/)\n\nSorry if this has been asked before, my search didn't come up with anything.

        "text": "For a long while I've been convinced that \"The Shortest Split-Line\" method of redistricting is the most honest/fair method of drawing district lines, thanks to CJP Grey's Video [\"The Shortest-Splitline Algorithm: a Gerrymandering Solution\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUS9uvYyn3A). (You can read more on this [here](https://redistrictingnow.wordpress.com/2010/04/13/13/))\n\nHowever, in the most recent [\"Last Week Tonight\" segment on Gerrymandering](https://youtu.be/A-4dIImaodQ?t=833)[13:53] John Oliver talks about how one of the more bizarre shaped districts (called [The Earmuff District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois%27s_4th_congressional_district)) is in such an odd shape so representatives can better serve the interests of their specific communities (latino and african american, respectively). Although this isn't a partisan scenario because both districts are Democrat majorities, it is an example of the \"packing\" portion of [Packing &amp; Cracking](https://www.bustle.com/p/how-does-packing-cracking-work-last-week-tonight-tackled-the-intricacies-of-gerrymandering-video-50089) style gerrymandering. To what benefit this is done is what I am curious about. \n\n\nThese two videos bring up valid views on redistricting that are inherently in opposition to one another. After watching both I'm curious if the situation John Oliver brings up is even valid when considering the \"greater good\" of the voter block in the area. The Hazards laid out in CJP Grey's [\"Gerrymandering Explained\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mky11UJb9AY) video show that political representation is more likely to lean towards non-representative representation if oddly shaped districts are allowed. \n\nSo this brings me to my title question: Are districts that are highly competitive for votes (diverse) better for communities or is a community better served when its district is drawn to be monocultural? \n\nedit: resubmitted with typo in title fixed.

While exhaustive, they offer little to any conclusive data about this subject matter.\n\n&gt;Although some recent studies have looked at the impact of regulations on the relationship between government and private business in general, less attention has been directed toward understanding precisely how government regulations have affected small businesses. There is good reason to believe that size matters. Precisely because of their smaller size, small businesses are likely to be less diversified and less able to leverage economies of scale or to access capital markets. As a result, small businesses might be more risk-averse and less able to react to unexpected events compared to larger businesses. In addition, the cost of complying with a particular regulation may be roughly comparable for smaller and larger firms, thus placing a disproportionate burden on the smaller firm.\n\nIt further goes into breaking regulations into four different categories: Corporate and Securities Law, Environmental Protection, Employment Law, and Health Insurance.\n\nAre regulations really negatively impacting smaller businesses?\n\nIs there a better alternative?\n\nDo we have ways to accurately track and quantify the relationship between business regulations (large and small) and their effect on the overall economy?\n\nEditing by: Nosecohn and Ummmbacon.",

Is there evidence?\n\nIf there is evidence, then what potential problems could arise by making it public? \n\nWhat evidence has been presented publicly regarding culpability for the attacks, and who has presented it?\n\nWhat actors in the area would have the capacity to undertake the attack?\n\nWhat strategic or tactical reasons would the Assad regime or others in the area have to undertake the attack?\n\nI remember coming across a comment somewhere today on reddit where the poster claimed that the chemical weapons were traced back to a syrian military facility. Googling found me no evidence except the Americans claiming that it is so. This report here is also ambiguous - http://time.com/4728155/nerve-gas-sarin-chlorine-syria-chemica-attack/\n\nI'd be very grateful if someone could explain/elaborate and/or point me to some sources that I can read up.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Turns out there is a counterpart to this argument called trickle-up economics, that states the cutting taxes for the middle class and poor will lead to economic growth/prosperity. It is very unclear which seems to do what it says it does. Republicans say it helps, Democrats say it doesn't.\n\n\nSo my question is, which one works? Why does the one work best over the other? Do taxes at all affect they path of an economy?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nP.S. Some clarification. What I mean by \"works\" is 1. Does the national average income increase? 2.

To summarize, the EO made companies disclose federal labor violations when bidding on federal contracts worth over $500,000. Sean Spicer commented that [\"The rule simply made it too easy for trial lawyers to go after American companies and American workers who contract with the federal government\"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/27/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-3272017-29). Critics were very harsh on this EO saying that it is [\"impossible to comply with\" and would \"significantly disrupt procurements and impose significant costs and burderns on the contracting community\"](http://hr.blr.com/HR-news/Discrimination/Government-Contractors/Fair-Pay-Safe-Workplaces-heavy-criticism/). Supporters lambasted Trump's decision, citing failures of government contractors to follow federal law: [19% of federal-employed contractors had over 1000 wage violations](https://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/2017-3-6_Warren_Contractor_Report.pdf) over the past three years. Additionally, 66% of federally employed contractors had more than 1 wage violation in the past 3 years. \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1) Do the cons of this EO outweigh the pros? (obviously this administration thinks so, what does NP think?)\n\n2) Is there a way to institute this regulation to protect workers while also not putting unjust burden on companies?\n\n\n*EDIT: added in source for Spicer quote\n",
