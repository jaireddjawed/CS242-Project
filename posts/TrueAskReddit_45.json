I lived in a pretty diverse neighborhood, the cul-de-sac I grew up in consisted of three white three white families, two black families, and one Asian family. At the high school I attended, whites were the minority and 60% of the students were black. As cheesy as it sounds I never really focused on anyone's race growing up, it just wasn't a big deal when you've grown up being used to being surrounded by different races. However when visiting my college roommate's home in Long Island, all I heard were comments and questions about racism in the south. Seriously, you wouldn't believe how many times I got asked by her friends AND adults there if I was racist because I was from the south. The questions didn't really bother me because I understood for the most part they were slightly joking. What did bother me was while they loved to poke fun at the south for being racist towards black people I only meet one black person there during my 8 day visit, and this girl also happened to be the only black person from their school. This whole experience made me extremely frustrated and left me wondering, \"How is the south seen as more racist when up in the north it can be considered normal to go your entire day and not see a black person?\"\n\nedit: And I understand Long Island doesn't represent the North as a whole and not the entire north is segregated.

To use myself as an example, I was involved in a mugging when I was younger, and in the process of defending myself, I stabbed and killed my attacker, who was 16. Apart from the shock of taking a life, I never really had any major issues come of it. But I'm realizing now, years later, that I do take a lot of personal blame for the incedent. And while talking to my SO about it, she urged me to forgive myself. \n\n My issue is that I don't particularly want forgiveness. Not that I want to beat myself up over it either, but to forgive myself is l, in my head at least, disrespectful of the life that I took. It just feels like forgiveness in too much like an emotional get out of jail free card. \n\nIt seems to be a common thing now to forgive others, and yourself, completely, for anything and everything. It feels like people assume that you can't be mentally stable if you feel guilt or remorse. Is it so improbable that sometimes forgiving yourself isnt the right answer?\n\nTLDR: Is it alright to not forgive yourself for all your mistakes?

        "text": "I'm posting this here in hopes to illicit some reasonable discussion.  This is far from my area of expertise, I just want to write my thoughts somewhere where they can be read by others, and where I can get some kind of feedback.\n\nI have previously held fairly right-wing economic and political opinions, and have started drifting further to the left.  I have been thinking a lot about what the point of the economy is, and I think a lot of the popular rhetoric really misses the point.  The economy should exist to bring benefit to society in some way, there is no reason to care about the economy for it's own sake.\n\nI often see or hear people talk about how inefficient the government is, how lazy government workers are, that working for the government is so pointless, etc...  But I think this is maybe a naive opinion.  The government exists mostly to care for the interests of the people and society at large.  If you are working for the government, you are performing some important service to society.  So let's say (just for illustration) that 80% of the work (actual, productive and useful work) a typical government employee does ultimately goes towards improving our measurement of how \"good\" our society is.  I'm assuming here that we judge the \"goodness\" of society in a fairly reasonable way.  e.g. having only moderate inequality, people have access to critical services, etc...  But this is another place where we would need to be careful about the measuring stick.\n\nNow consider working for a large company.  Ultimately, this worker's entire purpose is to serve the interests of a small number of people (the shareholders of the company).  This is especially apparent when we consider that most of the wealth generated in the past decades has gone to the top 1% of society.  Now, this might not necessarily be a bad thing - it is our hope that this work will also benefit society at large (with respect to our measuring stick).  We produce a lot of cheap goods which hopefully makes everyone better off.  So maybe we can say (again just for illustration) that 20% of the work this person does goes towards improving society.\n\nWith my made up numbers, the person working in the large company would need to be 5x more productive to give the same benefit to society as the government worker.  So, is it naive to hold such a negative opinion about government work and workers?  Do we need to be more careful about the \"measuring stick\" we use when we talk about how the economy is doing?",

Victims like Jennifer Lawrence and Erin Andrews could be spared a lot of pain and harassment if nudity was not taboo. I see this as a growing problem.\n* Imbalance of power between men and women. Women's bodies are more valued and this creates an unfair burden on them to guard modesty. \n* Men are encouraged to seek women's bodies as \"prizes\". Men feel like they achieve something when they see a woman's body. This encourages aggressive behavior.\n* A \"boomerang effect\"-like phenomenon. The purpose of hiding nudity is to suppress sexuality, but I believe it encourages the opposite effect by granting the body so much power. Scantily clad Super Bowl performances and sexually suggestive ads are more effective when nudity is taboo. \n* Shame is caused by having private parts exposed for either gender, despite that modesty serving no practical purpose.\n* Body and health awareness. People have warped ideas about what the human body does or should look like. Repressed sexuality leads to higher teenage pregnancy rates.\n* Minor practicality problems in areas like swimming &amp; sports. You need a suit to swim and nudity is part of the hygiene process in sports. \n\nWhat do you think? Is this an outdated concept? Do the taboos actually serve a practical, underappreciated purpose?",

And what do you define as socialism? Would it look as Orwell described in Europe, Spain specifically?\n\n&gt;\"I had dropped more or less by chance into the only community of any size in Western Europe where political consciousness and disbelief in capitalism were more normal than their opposites. Up here in Aragon one was among tens of thousands of people, mainly though not entirely of working-class origin, all living at the same level and mingling on terms of equality. In theory it was perfect equality, and even in practice it was not far from it. There is a sense in which it would be true to say that one was experiencing a foretaste of Socialism, by which I mean that the prevailing mental atmosphere was that of Socialism. Many of the normal motives of civilized life-snobbishness, money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc.-had simply ceased to exist. The ordinary class-division of society had disappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the money-tainted air of England; there was no one there except the peasants and ourselves, and no one owned anyone else as his master...One had breathed the air of equality. I am well aware that it is now the fashion to deny that Socialism has anything to do with equality. In every country in the world a huge tribe of party-hacks and sleek little professors are busy 'proving' that Socialism means no more than a planned state-capitalism with the grab-motive left intact. But fortunately there also exists a vision of Socialism quite different from this.\" George Orwell - Homage to Catalonia \n\nOr will it have its own unique or distinct features here in the U.S.?
