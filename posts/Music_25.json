Bit of a diva sure but man the guy could play.  Over the years I watched as music went from a passion of his to a trade. He had mastered the entire jazz fake book at like 30 but his passion for music died as it became more of a trade for him.\n\nstill.  he had a little jazz combo in a neighborhood bar and man they would let him just go off.  his passion for music would come back in these moments. his favorite player of all time was Errol Garner, which is obivious if you listen to this.  miss you pops. give it 2 minutes. pops was fuego.\n\nRetain your passion for music.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://youtu.be/rFWb\\_Vg4DQA](https://youtu.be/rFWb_Vg4DQA)",
