The list has two different types of items, planes (with #of doors, # of enginers, and manufacturer) and cars (with # of doors, and manufacturer). I'm on the verge of finishing, but in my file to use all of my packages, I'm getting errors. \n\nIs anyone knowledgeable in Ada, who wouldn't mind sending a PM to help with more context? I'm desperate and willing to compensate in return monetarily or however needed!",

In this review, I have to try to find the positives and negatives of the article (for example, did I understand the evidence, do they have enough detail, what would you have liked? find more in the article that is not there, what you found good in the article and who is there, etc ...) and to try to suggest ways to extend the work of the authors.\n\nAs far as it was my first attempt I followed the [wikihow guide to summarize a journal article](https://www.wikihow.com/Summarize-a-Journal-Article) I know I should have rather used the [How to Write an Article Review](https://www.wikihow.com/Write-an-Article-Review) ...\n\n[Here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/jbqpxvqdcybp) is my attempt.

        "text": "Hello r/compsci\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm a bit confused on how this part of shared libraries (.so files) work in Linux. I'll use glibc as an example. I've had times where I try to run a program and it complains that the glibc version used to compile the binary is not the version I have on my system, hence I got to rebuild from source. I run Fedora 27 x86_64 and I've seen glibc get updated when I do 'dnf update'. How come my programs still work even after the update and I don't get problems complaining my glibc version is not the same? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFrom my understanding, the point of having shared libraries is so people can update the libraries without needing the user of those libraries do anything (ie: recompile). That doesn't seem to be the case here. So when does a rebuild become necessary? And don't the need to rebuild programs that depend on those libraries defeat one of the purposes of having shared libraries which is being able to update the library without affect programs that depend on it?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Lets assume all shared libraries discussed here are dynamically linked during runtime.",

Do you have data/plots to support this?\n\n(2) Naturally, I can think of some reasons why some languages would make more \"effective\"/\"dangerous\" viruses than others. But I haven't actually seen any data on this. \n\nAny insights appreciated. Thanks!",
