It’s a “similar” of the biological drug called Humira.\n\nHumira and it’s patent are 20+ years old and currently the best treatment for multiple forms of arthritis and IBD. The patent means one dose is roughly $1,000.\n\nImraldi (the “knock off” or “dupe”) is obviously newer, as it’s a replica of Humira. One dose is roughly $400.\n\nIn essence : we have a great drug that many can’t access, and a less tested drug that more can access. People who can’t get treatment cannot work, or contribute to the economy. \n\nI understand that under capitalism this is fine as it means more money. People pay a lot to take the name brand and not die. Most can’t work, or leave the house, without one of these drugs, so they’ll pay anything.\n\nHowever, surely under capitalism it would be more economically viable to ban these patents, medicate people to the best of our ability, and let them work? Isn’t that the essence of capital: let people create some? \n\nPeople being dead, people being too disabled to work, when there’s a simple treatment, doesn’t help the economy.\n\nIf I put a patent on all menstrual products, which the average woman couldn’t afford, I’d cripple the work force. This would be bad for the economy and capitalism. Why does the same not apply to other healthcare?\n\nCan we claim it’s for economic reasons when it seems to be economically backwards? The only benefit I can see is having less disabled people in the population, as we die from lack of healthcare. If we lived, we could contribute to the economy. Every person with IBD I know is working full time. We want to contribute. But it’s nearly impossible for us to.",
