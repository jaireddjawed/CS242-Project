Work place drama affects me easily and influences who I trust and ultimately is the reason why I leave jobs. I don’t have good resistance to drama, and ppl always want to pull me into it. When I chose to build a wall between myself and others who are involved in the drama, it affects the way they work with me. So I end up feeling like the bad guy. All I want to do is focus on the job but I realized most humans socialize thru drama. I’ve come to realize that perhaps I need to focus on my goals more or maybe even that I’m not 100% on what I want which is true. I teeter a lot on what I want to do with my life. Idk what to do, I can’t necessarily avoid people forever at jobs.",

Corporations track everything to ensure that people are spending their time working on things with the most impact for the good of the company.\n\nBasically we have OKR which have an objective such as \"Reduce the bug count in our product by 15% this quarter\" and then everyone has KPIs like how many bugs they fixed. Based on the OKR these tickets are created in JIRA such as increasing the amount of automated software testing done to reduce bug count. Every task you do relates to an overall OKR.\n\nI am wondering if there is an app like this for personal goals and improvement. I want to run my life by tracking everything, not just calories or what not. Obviously you also need to be adaptable but setting goals and measuring them helps (such as tracking weight/body fat/calories for weight loss).

The only real reason I live with her is because I can at least occasionally use her car. I don’t know what I should do, and im lost and really hopeless. I don’t know what what I should do because I don’t even have the resources to start doing what it is I know I should be doing with my time on Earth. (music)",

I mean maybe i would have been rejected or accepted i don't know that but i could have  been you know what i mean this is so disturbing.You know what the real problem isnt even being her boyfriend or something. The problem is that i didnt do anything when there was something so important to me. The problem is that im a worthless coward.I realy hate myself sometimes i realy want to kill myself now you can call it just a love thing don't exaggerate but it really is a much bigger problem than that. I can't even respect myself, would you respect a coward? I really want to change but I don't know what to do. I've already listened to things like do sports or something, but nothing much has changed.I really don't know what to do. You know what let me tel you something ironic. If that girl broke up with her boyfriend and came to me, nothing would change. Sometimes I even dream of that, but I say to myself,\"Fuck, the things she lived with for 3 years won't go away, even if we're together now, if I wasn't a stupid bastard we could have memories together first, we could experience the firsts together''If there was a portal to the past, I'd give anything for it, my everything, really everything",

I looked at my screen time and had like 8 hours on TikTok for one day and was discussed with myself. I also kept having this feeling that I was sucking in other people negative energy through social media. I thought it would be hard but it surprisingly really wasn’t. The first two days I had to need to keep opening the apps out of habit but after that it was fine. Now that the month is over I thought I would jump back into it but I could really care less. I had like 30 minutes each day on everything soo far. I’d advise everyone to take a break here and there especially if your trying to work on self improvement.\n \nAnyways going to buy myself a switch and some games today because in this time I realized I liked that Zelda game and it seems like a fun way to keep myself occupied when I have downtime instead of watching strangers complain about their life’s.

It sucks cause he was initially interested in dating me and we had some mutual feelings but he stopped texting and calling but continued to be mean to me at work  .\n\nI am feeling a bit like a failure and I almost cried with a few tears . I am now seeing how difficult it is to build yout self esteem and beat toxicity.  I am sure some ppl relate..",

The progress I've made in the past two days is equitable with the progress I made in the past few years, and that was big in it's self. Agoraphobic, Anxious, Depressed - and it's all turning around after full time self-help therapy using ACT, CBT and most recently, for the first actual time in my life, philosophy that is actually changing the way I experience normal, minute by minute life.   \n\n\nI've done philosophy things before, in my thrashing around trying to capture some kind of answer to why my life just wont go the way I'd like it to. But deeper, why my mind, my emotions, my motivations wont go the way I'd choose for them to go in if I could. Why even my desires weren't reflective of me. I didn't want to do anything, even though I literally valued things that have activities attached to them.  \n\n\nSo I want to just say thank you to Socrates, believe it or not. I always kind of just cast him aside as 'an oldy timey philosopher thing', an out of date thinker from an ancient time who couldn't possibly have anything more valuable to my life than modern science. I mean modern science is a result of his legacy! How could it be less good.  \n\n\nBut in recent times, lectures by a professor called  John Vervaeke on 'embodied knowledge', and meaning has absolutely transformed my entire sense of my own will, agency, existence, what I am, what others are. Lecture after lecture, I've sat down and taken notes, and I've tried the practices he's suggested based on his deep philosophical dive into Socratic Dialectic (Dialogos).   \n\n\nNow that I feel such drastic improvements, I feel somehow like I can say ''I am trying really hard''. It is genuinely effort, and it's working, and I'm getting better at everything about being me.   \n\n\nFinally!  \n\n\nand I actually feel as if I've been physically working out.",

I had a very big ego last year, I was always bragging about my scores, talking in a sarcastic/banterish way to other people, and just being annoying overall. But over the past year, I have gone through so many different events that eventually humbled me. Slipping my grades, losing a relationship I actually really cared about, and basically failing everything that I had spent so much time on. All of this made me want to improve on myself and be a better overall person. Over the past year, I have certainly improved myself in a manner that's materialistic(e.g. better grades, and better extracurriculars). But I just basically stayed the same person. Even if I've become less socially outgoing, I still feel like I'm the same old 13 year old a year ago. I have tried to socially distance myself from other people, afraid of hurting them but everything I do doesn't work. It feels like everyone just still hates me, especially the koreans, the group of people with that I feel the most sense of community. But I have a close group of friends that I can always rely on. \n\nThere are certain phrases and actions I know I shouldn't say or do and I make mental notes about them but when I am in a social situation, it just slips out. Sometimes, I even enjoy saying those phrases even if I know the dire consequences. I don't know how to necessarily control myself even if I have gotten better. And no matter how much I try, that image of me is engrained in their mind and I just can't change it. Should I just not give a fuck and try to improve myself in other ways or should I care? If so, how can I improve myself to be a better person? Thanks in advance.",

I had also almost forgotten my suitcase today however my Grandma who was also visiting shouted across the street that I had left it, as I was almost at the car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I also hate how much I struggle to deal with these. I have been super busy so far in 2023 with a million things all happening at once in my life and it has been not easy trying to balance everything, so when I make a silly mistake like forgetting to bring trousers for a hiking trip, I get very angry at myself. I really hated myself when I was unpacking back in my flat an hour ago after seeing my family and realising that I forgot to bring the food they bought specifically for me. It feels like recently my mind has been in a million directions at once as I try to balance uni, work, hobbies, maintaining relationships, a social life and planning to work abroad in the summer so these are probably the main reason why I keep making these dumb mistakes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've never really stumbled across this subreddit before or browsed it but I was wondering if there is anybody who could maybe give advice or tips on how to minimise stupid mistakes like these from happening and how to not hate myself afterwards for it.

My self-esteem has developed some weird healing factor where it almost automatically gets overwhelmed with egotistical thoughts after experiencing rejection or any unflattering situation, as if I've become incapable of feeling humility for more than 10 minutes tops.\n\nNow I haven't gone full egotistical maniac, I have enough self-control to have any of this barely manifest themselves outwardly.\n\nBut it still pisses me off that all I've managed to do is lodge my mind into a different world from the \"real world\". And it feels so unfair that I'm being made to choose between a good relationship with myself and with reality. \n\nLike I still act the same, but instead of being afraid of feeling bad about myself, I'm afraid I'd start egotistically antagonizing people.

They hide their suffering and often the bigger the lifestyle, the crazier the consequences.

Even indirectly like by how they help more important people.\n\nHow to check for repressed trauma and/or repressed emotions:\n\nKeep in mind what you experience might not be real.\n\n1) Imagine someone confessing crimes against you to a third party\n\n2) Do so for up to 15 seconds\n\n3) If you didn’t feel anything, try again with a different person or different crimes\n\n4) If you felt something intense, consider seeking help\n\nHope you find this post useful.\n\nSincerely,\nsomeguy123678",

I feel like I could have become self-sufficient a long time ago. But I kept giving up. Initially after I finished HS I wanted to go to the University to study Informatics Engineering. I went there for a couple of months and then I gave up because it didn't motivate me and I was not putting any interest in it. I dropped out. Then I went and studied a course in Telecommunications for 2 years and eventually dropped out at the end of the course because there were 3 subjects that I hated. Then I went and studied Administration and Accounting. I dropped out after 2 months because I didn't like it at all.\n\nThen last year in May I got an accredited translation diploma from a translation school in Spain. I like translation/writing. I like translating texts. I felt like I finally found something. \n\nHowever, I don't know how to get started in this industry and put that diploma to use. My language pair is English-Spanish. I've sent 13+ CVs recently to different agencies and I got no response yet.\n\nI'd love to work as a translator. But it seems like it's extremely hard to get started.\n\nI'd love to work as a flight attendant. I wish I pursued this when I was younger. Now I can't because my mother wants to go back to my home country because she is starting her own business there. The only way for me to pursue this is if I am self-sufficient or something. But it's so hard for me to get work in something because I literally have 0 experience in anything. The only thing I have some experience in is translation. I tried working as a waiter but again, I have no experience in that. I like serving clients but I am not very good with multitasking. I prefer to focus on doing a few things very well than 10 poorly done.\n\nI'd also love to work in a nursery or something similar because I love plants. But I have no experience in that.\n\nI feel lost in this world. At the same time I do feel like I have the ability to do things. But I lack desire and motivation.\n\nI either give up on my dreams and goals and just go and force myself to work a \"normal\" job that I have no experience in, just to survive, or I don't know what else to do to pursue being a flight attendant, because at this point I really shouldn't expect my mom to help me financially.\n\nI missed my chance when I was younger. I didn't know what I wanted at that age. Now I know what I want but it's so hard because I have to be self-sufficient first and then pursue what I actually really want.",

When i was in highschool (first year) there was a girl i love.I really love her but i don't know for some reason i never talked to her i was afraid i would screw up and i would look weird i couldn't take any steps.I just watched her from behind until she left school like a cowardly bastard.It's my first year at university now and by chance we came to the same school again, and during this 4 year interval, just like today and all other days, I wondered what my life would be if I wasn't a pussy.I don't know why but I don't care about any other woman how this girl got into my head I don't feel anything when I look at other girls it just feels empty.and she has a bf now for 3 years and i think i could have been that man. I mean maybe i would have been rejected or accepted i don't know that but i could have  been you know what i mean this is so disturbing.You know what the real problem isnt even being her boyfriend or something. The problem is that i didnt do anything when there was something so important to me. The problem is that im a worthless coward.I realy hate myself sometimes i realy want to kill myself now you can call it just a love thing don't exaggerate but it really is a much bigger problem than that. I can't even respect myself, would you respect a coward? I really want to change but I don't know what to do. I've already listened to things like do sports or something, but nothing much has changed.I really don't know what to do. You know what let me tel you something ironic. If that girl broke up with her boyfriend and came to me, nothing would change. Sometimes I even dream of that, but I say to myself,\"Fuck, the things she lived with for 3 years won't go away, even if we're together now, if I wasn't a stupid bastard we could have memories together first, we could experience the firsts together''If there was a portal to the past, I'd give anything for it, my everything, really everything",

        "text": "Self-confidence fills our world with joys and abundance that we can’t get without it. However, it’s possible to step over the line where it benefits us and we become too confident. Overconfidence can lead to dangerous situations. It can damage us, both personally and professionally. \n\nSo, what are these dangers?\n\n**Consider these indicators of overconfidence:** \n\n1. **Taking too many risks.** ***Are you taking unnecessary risks because you feel powerful and able to control them?*** These risks might be in your relationships, career, or physical, such as in extreme sports. \n\n· Risks can’t be avoided completely, but overconfidence can convince you to take too many of them. At some point, you won’t be able to control the consequences of your risky behaviour.\n\n2. **Inability to see mistakes.** Mistakes can occur in every aspect of your life, but overconfidence can make you blind to them. If you believe you never make a mistake, then it’s time re-evaluate your confidence levels. \n\n· Mistakes provide important learning opportunities. By ignoring them, you're not getting the full benefit of the mistakes.\n\n3. **Blaming others.** Overconfidence can lead to blaming because you feel like anything that goes wrong can’t be your fault. It always has to be due to someone else’s shortcomings or behaviour.\n\n· However, by blaming others, you’re risking your relationships. You’re also losing the opportunity to grow and learn from the situation. ***Responsibility is an important aspect of success.*** \n\n4. **Refusal to learn.** You may believe that you’re done learning and have nothing new to discover. Overconfidence in your abilities and knowledge may prevent you from learning the very ideas or skills that will bring you success. \n\n· Those who are successful advocate learning more, regardless of how much you already know.\n\n· Learning is a life-long experience that benefits the brain and body. You don’t have to go back to school or take extra classes to learn. You can read, write, or develop new hobbies.\n\n5. **Refusal to listen.** Overconfidence may lead you to ignore the advice of others. You may also have difficulty listening to feedback or criticism. \n\n· ***It’s important to listen to the comments that others make because they may have valuable insight.*** They may see an aspect that you’re missing. They may be able to help you avoid mistakes or formulate a plan that jumps you forward toward achieving a goal. \n\n6. **Cutting it close.** Overconfidence may make you cut things too close. You may arrive late or miss deadlines. \n\n· Your inflated confidence levels may make you believe that everyone will just wait for you. The reality may differ from your expectations, and you may end up losing opportunities or dealing with serious consequences.  \n\n7. **Predicting the future.** Overconfidence can lead to inaccurate predictions. For example, you may believe that a raise will be easy to get or a potential client will instantly engage you.\n\n· Your judgment may not be correct. Your overconfidence can make you ignore important elements of the current situation that affect your future.\n\nIt’s important to have confidence in your abilities and skills, but realistic expectations and ideas contribute to your wisdom and make life easier. Avoid letting overconfidence dim the bright future you can create with your unique talents.\n\n**Check that your confidence is supported by the competence to deliver the goods.**\n\nI have posted more quick reads on my own little corner of Reddit – it would be great to see you there.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND:\n\n4 years ago today I tried to OD on pills. I don't know what stopped me, but I couldn't do it. I just didn't feel like killing myself. It felt so easy to let go and die, then to deal with hell. Nothing major was going on. I had a loving relationship with my parents and I wasn't poor. But socially I was doing horrible. In middle school I had no friends, no girls, and I was very overweight. I had a lot of pent up anger, I tried to get revenge on my bullies and everyone who called me fatass. In 2020 I went to the gym and I quickly lost 40 pounds, I also had almost of a flat stomach and I got some muscle in my arms. Only problem about the weight loss was that my motivation was only anger. After covid hit, I didn't have to worry about getting bullied, punched, picked on, so my motivation let go. I gained all the weight I lost pre Covid and depression hit hard again. 2021 was the worst of it, I never felt so lonely in the pandemic and I would cry every night wishing I was someone else. Some one who had friends, a girlfriend, someone who cared. I grew bitter, I compared myself to other people, and I lost my grandpa to cancer who I loved. Things went on like this until January 2023. There was a lot of lonely days at school, sad days at home, and days were I was bitter about my past.\n\nBut\n\nNothing lasts forever, change is **inevitable**\n\n**Wanna know how to feel better?**\n\nMake **small** changes. Really! It seems small but a habit is like a plant. The roots grow slowly then the sprout rapidly grows. \n\n1. **I learned to forgive.** A few years ago during Covid (my lowest point) I tried meditation and mindfulness. I hated meditation and how you had to breathe deeply but over time it taught me to be in the present. Over time and the more I did it I didn't worry that much about my past, getting bullied, and how I failed losing the weight. You can't control your past. You're never gonna get back there. So why worry about it. Forgive the people who wronged you, you don't have to like them, but it's much better to have closure than to have hatred.\n2. **Make habits that will determine your future.** My new years resolution for 2023 was to finally lose weight. In December 2022 I weighed 93kg(206lbs) and my goal was to weigh 81kg(180lbs). I didn't know how to get there. But on Jan 1st I tried running on the treadmill for 30 mins, I did it once, then twice, then 3 times and now working out is a habit. I've lost 4.9kg(11 lbs) in 2 months and I've been doing cardio for 8 weeks for 3 to 4 days. Some other habits I'm trying is that I'm trying to limit porn usage (watch it less), and I'm studying for tests in high school.\n3.  **Don't be afraid to tell loved ones how you feel.** I used to not trust my parents, I used to tough my emotions out and carry my emotions in a bottle. But carrying a weight can only last so long. I have supporting parents, so I finally reached out to them about how I feel. If you don't have parents who are supportive, then tell a friend. Tell him how you feel. Trust me! You are human. You have emotions. We are not meant to suppress them. You are not weak if you cry. You are not weak if you get help. I never got help, my family doesn't understand mental health that much. I had to help myself from the ground up.\n\nAfter making these 3 changes in my life, my quality of life is getting better. As of March 2023 I no longer have depression and I think I've found happiness. Something I haven't found in a long time. My life isn't perfect. I still struggle with doubt from time to time. But that's the human in YOU! People struggle, but it's so much rewarding if you fight through your demons then to quit. Never give in, never commit suicide. It only causes more pain. You might have to go through a battle like me or have a cakewalk, but more battles eventually wins a war. Keep fighting!",

        "text": "How tf does everyone do it? Have everything under control in life. Do so much stuff and be productive most of the time and not get burnt out. How?\n\nI'm in 11th grade at the moment so school is starting to become a lot more important, so everyone has started working hard and stuff. And around me, literally everyone around me has their life under control. They consistently complete over 90% of homework tasks on time, have their notes all in order for all their subjects, and are prepared and motivated enough to be ready for exams about a week in advance. All of their classwork is completed in class and they are always focused in class, and then after school they work hard and consolidate everything, all on their own accord. A lot of them also do tutoring and manage to complete all their tutoring work. Some of them even accelerate one or two subjects.\n\nAnd it's not as if all they're doing is studying. Half the people around me participate in bands and/or morning sports practice, and some have part-time jobs after school and still have time for socialising and playing video games and social media and stuff. Some kids around me are learning to drive, cook and do like a dozen chores each day, and also consistently train themselves in the gym. Everyone else has so much more of a life than me, and yet still manages to do everything so productively and efficiently. And everyone seems to be so self-motivated to do everything and to challenge and improve themselves.\n\nSo my question to everyone who's really productive and self-motivated is: how on earth do you keep it up?\n\nMeanwhile, I'm about 5 weeks behind on all my schoolwork and keep having to explain to my parents why they keep getting emails from my teachers, I've literally got no notes at all for any of my subjects, I haven't prepared at all for any of my assessments, and don't even do any tutoring or acceleration. I don't do anything in the mornings, am often constantly burned out, have very few co-curriculars, etc.. I have barely any close friends and have like barely ever been out for social occasions. I don't play any video games, don't have any social media apart from Reddit, and don't do much in my spare time apart from occasionally watching some TV. I don't have a job and literally have zero life skills and I'm turning 16 in less than 2 months. I have no idea what I'm going to do once I graduate, and yet everyone else seems well prepared for life while I'm often just at a complete standstill waiting for time to pass.\n\nThe funny thing is, no-one realises my situation. I'm a gifted kid (145+) who probably has undiagnosed ADHD, and I'm still one of the top students in the grade. What others see is that I keep getting A's and not having to do much to get them and envy me for it. In reality, I'm using my strong intuition and my ability to learn things very quickly to scrape by and get A's. I procrastinate heavily on literally everything and manage to do the bare minimum and still get a top mark. I'm near the top of the school for my sport, but it's actually just due to having a good coach rather than me actually working hard. I used to do a ton of co-curriculars but now I don't have time to do any of them. I do maths and science olympiads but there are so many people who do better than me and yet are on top of school and also do a bunch of other stuff.\n\nI used to be the kid who had everything: top grades, success in a bunch of academic competitions and doing extremely well at like 5 different co-curriculars, and doing well in 2 different sports, all without having to try too hard for it. Now I just feel like I'm bouncing from one thing to the next without any form of structure or control in my life. I've literally heard the phrase \"not living up to your potential\" from most of the people I know, and everyone keeps telling me I need to try harder, but in truth I have no idea how you do that. It's not even that I'm too busy; I spend more time staring at a wall contemplating my life than actually being productive. And every time I manage to convince myself to actually start being productive, I burn out way too quickly and end up right back where I started.\n\nSo how on earth do I actually try hard and be productive, like how everyone wants me to be? I am somehow moving forward in life, but I can't find any form of consistency and control. I've tried setting goals for myself, but I pretty much never manage to achieve them. And even when I do, I just end up playing it down and telling myself that I should have higher expectations of myself. I've tried setting up a rigid schedule, but I can't maintain the required discipline (due to undiagnosed ADHD) and just end up procrastinating.",

        "text": "Hello, I’ve been struggling on and off with brain fog for a while but it has gotten pretty intense and constant lately. To put into perspective, I am 24M, diagnosed with treatment resistant depression and anxiety, always been on a rather plain and bad diet (constant fast food, burgers, fried chicken, French fries etc) and never really taken vitamins until recently. I’m not overweight or super fit and don’t workout or get exercise like I should or did growing up. Past few years have been hell for me. Can’t hold a job, push people away and stress family out with my life issues with depression. \n\nI’ve been having really bad and almost completely constant days where I feel groggy, sleep too much and almost feels like what I imagine someone senile to feel like when getting older. I can’t put words together or make sense of things around me and I find it hard to focus and it’s getting scary.  \n\nI’ve finally decided to stop feeling sorry for myself and try to take care of the root of the problem which I believe to be my diet and exercise. I just started a couple days ago and still feeling pretty crappy (yes I know it’s super early to tell a difference) but just wanted to know if anyone else experienced anything else like this and what they may have done to help or fix it. I just want to feel normal again and get a job. Any comments help. Thank you",

        "text": "Hi all! I've been following CPG Grey's \"seasonal themes\" theory of self improvment and breaking my goals down by season. If you haven't seen his video, the summary is new years resolutions fail for a lot of people because they're too long of a timeline, too broad, and/or too overwhelming. He suggests that by breaking your resolutions into S.M.A.R.T goals with time lines that are realistically achievable in chunks of 3-4 months, you have a better chance of successfully improving yourself and achieving your yearly resolutions. \n\nI'm ending \"Financial Stability Winter\" very succesfully with a positive bank account and upward trending credit score! Now I'm starting plans to begin \"mental health spring\" at the end of the month, with the main goals being to swap poor coping mechanisms with healthier ones. Number one being to break my addiction to my phone and social media. \n\nI have two paid apps and additional barriers within social media apps &amp; my phone settings trying to block my access to the offending websites, but it simply isn't enough. No matter what, when I'm overly anxious or depressed or just understimulated and bored, I find a way through. And with trying to be fiscally responsible, I think these unperforming subscription-based (or $100+ lifetime access) apps are next on the chopping block. So I'm starting to think I need to just ditch the smartphone entirely. \n\nI've been lurking on r/dumbphones for a few weeks, and I love the idea of returning to my childhood of flip phones, but honestly... the options are all either too expensive or too difficult to make work to be worth it to me.\n\nI still want the conveniences of Spotify, Google maps, Discord, and the ability to receive texts/calls from my main number (I have a loved one with memory issues and don't want to change numbers for their safety) all with a device that takes a good picture. A smartwatch offers the most of these and I can only assume an EXTREMELY unpleasant social media experience that would be enough to deter me. I can keep my phone on me and turned off (or in a difficult to access container at home) and only turn it on when I need it for a picture, a lengthy text response, answer a call easier, etc. The startup time on it along with my longass passcode is enough to give me time to reconsider any social media urges. Not to mention I can get a slightly older refurbished smartwatch for &lt;$70 and set it up easily.\n\nI was wondering if anyone else here had experience breaking their social media addiction or had used smartwatches at all really lol. I've never met anyone that used anything more than a fit bit, and wanted to see if there were any words of wisdom for someone looking into one! I'm currently considering the Galaxy Watch 4 (ideally the classic, though it's pricier), but I'm fully open to suggestions for anything other than an apple watch!",

In University, I had co-op ever 4 months and I missed that too.

Should it just be a fantasy I leave behind? I feel like it is possible, I've seen so many people out with their friends, so I don't understand why this is so hard for me. I know I will grow and learn a lot from this experience but people just don't seem to want to include me or bring me into their group or form a group with me. I really don't know why because I think I'm friendly, adventurous, and easygoing. I struggle with some mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, codependency, and derealization/depersonalization which I'm working through in therapy. Maybe that has to do with my inability to connect with people. I know the life I want but it just feels impossible to attain it. Is there a secret that I'm missing?",

Understand that you only procrastinate on things that are not really as important to you as you imagine. If it were truly important to you, you would get it done.\r\nYou are designed to procrastinate, hesitate and frustrate on things that are low on your list of values in order to help redirect you back to what is truly most important to you; because what's truly important to you, where your identity is, is where your authenticity is.\r\nWhen you become cognizant of that feedback, align your life's actions with your highest values and begin living by priority again, your self- worth will increase, your self-image will go up, and you will begin feeling inspired, energized and vitalized.\r\nSo in short, understand your values are malleable.

I'd be coughed at in the halls, made fun of on social media, tripped in the cafeteria, have whole group chats made about me. All because my ex best friend got a Friday detention because of me so ofc we had a falling out. And she turned a lot of people against me. Now when I got to seventh grade I was already out of the loop since I missed so many days of sixth grade also due to bullying. Like I could never go to school for a straight week and then I'd sometimes just miss a week at a time. So by the time I got to seventh grade I was just so over it. People started getting suspicious of why I was never at school so I said I was homeschooled. Nobody knew the truth I told my parents that my friends mom was paying for it. And that was fine until I was in court for legal trouble that happened over the summer and they mentioned I hadn't gone to school in a good while. So I enrolled myself in a subscription based home study program that I had no intention of doing just to get the state and CPS off my back. I was still hanging out with my friends, I was still socially relevant, I still talked to a lot of people at school so I didn't feel lonely I was still in the loop. Then the pandemic rolled around no one was in school so I felt no remorse for being in it. And honestly the pandemic was the best few months of my life. But it's been awhile since then things have changed. I've grown to regret my decisions I see my best friend at school hear their stories and I'm so sad that I'm not there. Like I'm missing out wasting my teenage years. Ive been diagnosed with aniexty and have become depressed during these times with suicidal thoughts. My parents still don't know but my four best friends know. I wanna get a job but idk if u can get an ID without being in school. So uh any tips to fixing my life if there is any? (P.S don't need a lecture I already wake up and go to sleep regretting my life choices and hating my life)",

        "text": "I had a migraine this morning.\n\nIt happened before, but rarely, just three times in pass three years. it came with painful headache, my left eye felt like a meat boll burning on the grill, and my right eye was fine. It also made me vomit, I was like a pregnant lady throwed up even I didn’t have any breakfast on that morning. The migraine happened in the morning, and somehow tortured me in an odd way to pain.\n\nI took it seriously, but not seriously enough that I still went to work anyway after taking two pills. While driving, I started wondering why I had the migraine. Maybe because the weather. It has been cold and windy recently in north California. The weather is so weird that it decides to be cold in the end of the winter. But the thought popped up, “The stress”. Yes, it must be. The stress I has been absented the classes in pass one month, the stress so many assignments are pending and overdue time on Canvas, the stress the decision I made so many times to get them done after work at a Starbucks, but I drove to home instead in the end. \n\nAnd why? I asked myself, the way to the work seems too long today and I maybe can figure it out the question. So, why I have done that to make me under the pressure? As the first and half generation immigrant, came with my parents to the USA three years ago, why I gave up the English writing, speaking, reading classes, the opportunities to improve the English for a better life and communication. Why? \n\n28 years old. Female. Had a bachelor degree in my country. Love classic music, opera, movies, reading, draw, adventure, food, news, people, I used to be. Now I have a fulltime job, live with my parents, and attending online ESL classes in a community college. But, most people I can talk with, only my family members. My colleagues don’t really talk that much with me, I work 8 hours a day, only less 30 minutes we would have some small talks. Basically, not social life, no friends, no sparking, fire, flowers in my life. I take most responsibility of my parents, and I live my life like I am a tool. I am a google translate for my family, but I can’t even order food well in the IKEA. I am a windows office software for my family, who fill out all application, emails, documents, tax report. I am a typical Asian daughter, who feel the purpose of my life is honor my family. I am a tool that should improve English to be able to read, writing, speak, and to order food or whatever, to translate the news, and to make the decision of any insurance, medical, or financial plan, and to fill out the job application, and to write a resume. I need to improve my English, even I don’t have a friend to talk with. \n\nI am escaping from the empty in my deeply heart and all disappointment I feel of my life so I absent the classes because I am not learning for myself. Like a robot who doesn’t want to be updated because she suddenly remembers she used to be a human being. I’m funny, but lonely. Loneliness, self-assurance, hopeless, and insecure. Day by Day, I go to work and just go back home. Loneliness, self-assurance, hopeless, and insecure.  \n\nI had a migraine this morning, and I have been absent the classes in pass whole month, but now everything makes sense.",

        "author": "djwegmans",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/11hgcng/behavioral_analysis/",
        "text": "The topic I wish to discuss, the quantitative analysis of human behavior, is one that I have examined for several years. I hope to continue to expand my observations on this topic for many years to come, as I find it captivating and believe that it has many different applications in daily life. I wish to preface this discussion by clarifying that I do not have professional authority in this area, and do not believe that my interest in this topic constitutes science. Despite this, I believe that methodically examining one’s behavior in the way that I describe can approximate some of the utility of science, insofar as I believe that it will provide readers valuable insights into trends and patterns that exist in their lives, and perhaps ways to overcome challenges constructively. The realm of science is the demonstration that empiric observations do not falsify theories about the structure of reality as it presently exists in a general sense and did in the past as well. Analysis of one’s own behavior is intrinsically a much more subjective exercise and not generalizable to others or to the description of a generalized model of behavior. However, I hope by writing about this topic to convince the reader of its usefulness to their own life. I also hope to contend that quantifying behavior in a more formal context may one day have valuable applications within the realms of science and medicine. Perhaps if daily behavior is measured in a relatively objective manner in the longitudinal and quantitative manner, I describe it can begin to be implemented into formal scientific studies as a useful variable.\n\nMy examination of behavior essentially began as an offshoot of my journal, which I keep in the form of an excel spreadsheet titled by the present year (i.e., “2021”). I write entries throughout the year and begin a new spreadsheet each January first. My journal entries are listed by date in one column and entry in the next. I also tag journal entries with different letter abbreviations to describe content, i.e., “w” for writing ideas, “d” for dreams, “t” for thoughts, or “s” for scientific ideas. If one day’s entry discusses multiple topics, I separate these topics with forward slashes (“/“). Although excel began as a convenient way for me to catalogue my thoughts, I have gradually expanded my use of it over many years to record various types of information about my life. Besides a journal I have sections of my spreadsheets that I use to keep track of my calendar (personal and professional), movies I have watched (and with whom I have watched them), books I have read, addresses, and birthdays. At one point I separated these sections into different tabs but have more recently consolidated them onto a single tab entitled “Journal.” \n\nI use a second tab, “Finance,” to keep track of my expenses. I began monitoring my finances in a manual fashion around 2015 to keep track of my spending and with the specific goal in mind of spending less yearly on food. I am not an exceptional cook and eat out too frequently. Keeping a log of my personal finances also afforded me the opportunity to learn more about various topics in finance that interested me, such as simple moving averages. Finally, I used this tab as an excuse to learn more about various excel formulas, which I used to partially automate my record keeping process. One column of my finance tab records expense descriptions, i.e., “Walmart” or “gas,” while adjacent columns list price and date of purchase. Another column to the right records the amount spent per week by category of expense, such as groceries or transportation, with embedded excel formulas used to automatically record these sums based on the week’s various expenses and their descriptions (i.e., this formula ensures that all purchases from “Giant” are added to the “grocery” total). These subtotals are then summed to give the week’s total expenses. Columns across the top of the Finance tab consolidate this information across the entire year, with one row for each week, and various columns for total weekly expenses, total weekly grocery expenses, total weekly transportation expenses, etc. Additional columns keep a running tally of averages and 10-week simple moving averages, and a final row is used to project the likely yearly expenses based on current total expenses and the proportion of the year that has elapsed. \n\nI use a third and final tab of my spreadsheet, “Health,” to keep track of behavior. This third tab initially began as a way for me to keep track of my running, which I enjoy but am decidedly mediocre at. To motivate myself to run more, I would log every run with the time ran in one column and the date in an adjacent column. Eventually I began tracking weightlifting as well, and had one column for date, one column for running, and a third for weightlifting. Subsequently, I expanded the use of this tab beyond exercise and began recording the amount of time that I mediated throughout the week, the amount that I read, and the amount that I cooked to encourage myself to do these activities more often as well. Initially, I would keep track of time using the same watch I took with me when I went running - a very simple black $5 watch that I purchased at Walmart a few years ago. I kept a running total of the amount of each activity I did throughout the year. It was very gratifying to watch the totals slowly rise over the course of the year, and over several years I could compare my habits and determine whether I was becoming healthier (exercising, cooking, and meditating more) and more scholarly (reading more). In this way I have found that monitoring my behavior quantitatively to be intrinsically motivating and fulfilling. I have tried to avoid being too anal retentive and needlessly recording information about all the recurring activities of my daily life. I have restricted myself to those that I wish to do more because I find them particularly gratifying, interesting, or good for my health (running, reading) or those behaviors where performing them more frequently would confer some essential utility to my daily life (cooking, grocery shopping).\n\nI discovered a more concrete, practical application for this tab when I began medical school. As you may know medical school demands students read a very high volume of material (thousands of hours) to pass their classes, pass their board exams, and complete their degrees. These classes encompass a wide variety of topics, from the basic sciences pertinent to medicine (i.e., biochemistry, genetics) to the body’s various organ systems (cardiovascular, gastrointestinal), to the practice of various medical specialties (internal medicine, surgery). Each semester of classes builds on the previous and it is essential for all students to keep up with their readings. There are simply no shortcuts to the accumulation and consolidation of this body of knowledge, which continues to grow larger every year. Keeping track of the amount of time that I spent studying on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis was critical for me to pass my exams. Some students are gifted with incredible memories and only need to go over material once to memorize it and recall it on exams. I am not so fortunate and required what I believe to be somewhat longer than average to receive passing grades. I could not have effectively kept track of the amount of time I spent reading without this spreadsheet tab. It allowed me to establish weekly standards for myself (i.e., study four hours a day) and also helped me to anticipate how much I would need to study for certain classes (i.e., if a certain class required 50 hours of studying for a passing grade, another class known to be similarly challenging would likely require a similar volume of studying). Initially I used my watch to keep track of the amount of time I read. Later, I switched to mainly studying off my iPad and using the “screen time” function available in settings. This allowed me to identify the amount of time I spent specifically on apps dedicated to my studies (i.e., UWorld, Acrobat) without accidentally rewarding myself for distracting myself with social media or the internet.\n\nRecording the time I spent studying methodically in a spreadsheet also allowed me to graph my studying habits throughout the year and observe visual trends. Besides graphing weekly totals of the amount of time I spent studying throughout the year, I eventually also decided to chart running averages and 10-week simple moving averages as I did with my finances. After about two years of tracking these averages, I wholesale converted the format of the “Health” tab to reflect the “Finance” tab. I overall found this format useful for recording quantitative information about different types of behavior and monitoring long term trends. Recording behavior in this manner also allowed me to fluidly vary the specific behaviors I tracked as my interests or goals changed while still tallying totals across a few global categories (i.e., two different study techniques I used often in medical school, Anki and UWorld, as well as the amount of time I spend on research projects, are all tallied in the study column, whereas running and biking are both tallied in the exercise column). In this way I began to scrutinize my behavior in much the same way that I analyze my finances or the prices of stocks and began thinking about their trends in a similar fashion (i.e., what caused them to go up or down at certain points in time, and what they were likely to do in the future if certain conditions presented themselves).\n\nAfter charting my behavior for a few years, several patterns began to emerge. First, I noticed that even if activity trended in a certain direction over the course of the year (i.e., I studied more as classes became more difficult) that weekly totals fluctuated constantly. Some weeks I would study more and some I would study less, and as much as I sought to simply “study more” the reality was that I was not able to improve my habits with robotic efficiency. Secondly, different habits exhibited different trends throughout the year. During some parts of the year, I would exercise more, during other parts I would read for pleasure more, and still other parts I would study more. These periods would sometimes correspond with one another, but sometimes not. With regards to this point, my behavior has exhibited several trends throughout the years - periods of high activity of specific behaviors over the course of many weeks, often in response to certain environmental stressors. One such example: I spent much more time meditating while studying for my board exams (likely to avoid placing too much stress on myself and to take periodic breaks from reading). Another such example: I tend to exercise the most in the spring and late summer when it is most comfortable to run outside. In these examples I cannot demonstrate any level of causation between environment and behavior but only say anecdotally that I seem to observe these trends and am able to identify environmental factors present at those times. Whether there is a link between the two I can only speculate but I can say with some confidence that I believe there is a relationship between the two. If I were to try to establish a more concrete link between behavior and environment, I believe that I would probably try to record variables over time outside of behavior and look for correlations between the two (i.e., record weight at the same time every week and look for a correlation between exercise and weight). Of course, as noted above, if I were to ever desire to demonstrate that relationships existed between behavior as tracked in this manner and environment with any level of scientific accuracy, it would be necessary to conduct a study with many participants and most likely a more objective means of behavioral record keeping than self-reporting. I will conclude this point by noting that although I sought to identify (or perhaps impose) some sort of order on my behavior by charting it, the more precisely I observed it the more organic it appeared, invoking a reflection of the body’s natural circadian rhythm on a longer time scale. However, I have observed a few trends over the course of several years that I believe are not wholly organic but are in fact a direct result of my behavioral analysis to begin with. The first year that I recorded behavior formally, 2019, I logged 108 minutes of activity a day across multiple categories. This number has risen successively over the course of the last four years, and I currently am recording about 7.6 hours of activity a day. Even though I have gotten slightly busier over the course of the past four years, I believe that tracking my behavior and specifically the amount of time dedicated to useful activities, the better my time management has become. This has afforded me more time to spend on the parts of life that are most important to me. I believe that my attention span has also improved, which I would here offer the amount of time I spend weekly reading for pleasure (3 hours in 2019 and 5 in 2022) as an informal proxy. Consequently, at this point I would contend that quantitatively analyzing behavior over a long period of time is not merely a useful way to identify trends but also to condition behavior.\n\nI mentioned meditation above and would like to place more emphasis on the utility of rewarding oneself for recording information about this category of behavior. By meditation I mean a few different activities that I group in the same category of the Health tab, titled “Mindfulness.” First, sitting quietly for a dedicated period and thinking about things that have happened recently in my life without distraction. I permit myself to drink some tea if I am so inclined. Next, going for walks throughout the day, which I always find are able to help me clear my head. Finally, and I cannot stress enough the utility of this choice enough, dedicated blocks of time during the day when I do not check the internet, social media, or my email. To keep up with essential electronic communications, during these blocks of time, I permit myself to check my messages and work email at 8 am, 12 pm, 4 pm, and 8 pm. Otherwise, I avoid electronics completely (except for, for example, my iPad on airplane mode for studying purposes) to remain focused on other activities. Then, when I record this block of time in the Health tab, I subtract the total amount of time I have spent on my computer and phone during the day (again using the “screen time” function) to discourage nonessential use of electronics. I have found that the more effectively I have learned to carve out specific blocks of time away from electronics to focus on various tasks, the more my attention span and memory have improved. I also reward myself if I avoid electronics completely between evening and morning by recording this interval and have found that developing discipline in this realm has greatly improved my sleep hygiene. I would subjectively say that my sleep quality has improved over the past few years, and I also find that I am better rested and more focused during the day. \n\nThese methods may possibly seem excessive, but it is the alternative I have willingly chosen to several (in my opinion) unhealthy coping strategies that society tolerates as ways to get through the day such as smoking, alcohol, and the various distractions available on television and the internet. With regards to the latter, I believe that while the internet is a very powerful, useful, and essential tool in the Information Age, we are fallible as human beings to using it for vice. It is an easy way for us to distract ourselves from our daily, necessary work. However, the more dependent we grow on it, the more damage I believe it has the potential to inflict on our attention spans and mental fortitude. The internet has now become a deeply integrated component of our daily lives: people spend an average of 3 hours and 15 minutes on smartphones and check their phones an average of 58 times a day. Interestingly, this figure varies widely by both country and age, suggesting that there are several cultural factors at work influencing daily smartphone use and likely technology use altogether. This is more time than I generally spend exercising, reading, and cooking altogether on any given day. Currently, per screen time data, I spend about 2.5 hours a day on my iPhone but hope to decrease this figure moving forward to perhaps 1.5 hours if possible. I believe that it is essential that we regulate the use of this tool which has become such an essential (but at the same time, I fear, addictive) element of our daily lives, so that it does not supplant more critical components of our hierarchy of needs. To summarize, mindfulness has received increasing attention over the past several years as an important element of health and I could not agree with this trend more emphatically. Mental health and physical health are intimately interconnected, and it would be a critical error for me to recommend the analysis of behavior relating to one’s physical health while neglecting mental health as well. \n\nRelating to our hierarchy of needs, I have also used my spreadsheets to reward socializing. I started using my Health tab in this manner when I noticed that I was becoming lonelier and more isolated during the middle of medical school after a difficult break up. My studies were quite challenging during this period, and it was very difficult to justify spending my time on almost anything else. Carving out dedicated blocks of time to call my friends on the phone or go to dinner with them helped me to rise above my partially self-imposed isolation and get past the behavioral inertia that was leading me to study at the expense of other, equally important parts of my life. While I keep track of the amount of time that I dedicate to my friends and family to ensure that I do not needlessly isolate myself in my studies, I believe that other individuals could find many other potential applications to this kind of timekeeping. Perhaps individuals with social anxiety disorder could reward themselves for going to parties or on dates, for example. I would further contend that individuals with ASD may find this sort of timekeeping a useful way to understand on a deeper level the amount of time required for activities of daily living (i.e., cooking, grocery shopping) and to manage their time more effectively as adults in particular.\n\nI would say that what I have accomplished with the guidance of my Health spreadsheet is quotidian. I am not an exceptional athlete or student. The furthest I have ever run is a half marathon, and most of my classmates are smarter and more successful than I am. However, I will say that my spreadsheets helped me to accomplish some of my goals, such as passing my medical board exams, and that I might not have accomplished these goals otherwise. I hope for the reader, by applying my thoughts and recommendations to their own lives, to achieve even greater ends themselves. I believe that tracking behavior has value for students and athletes, people struggling with social anxiety, and even individuals who are simply busy and wish to manage their time more effectively. At a few different points, I have sought to convert my spreadsheets into an app with the hopes of making my ideas more accessible to others. However, I continue to regard excel as a very powerful piece of software – easy to use, adaptable to numerous different applications, and conveniently accessible from any computer or phone using google drive. Additionally, the software’s features make it easy to graph longitudinal behavioral data and analyze trends. As a result, I continue to use excel, believing no alternative to be superior.\n\nFinally, if this topic still seems banal to the reader, I will contend that there is perhaps no more valuable resource than time in the Information Age, and no more critical task than its appropriate use or allocation. The global population may continuously rise, and inflation may continuously diminish the value of the dollar, but time remains absolute and unchanging, like the total mass of gold on earth. There will always be seven days in a week, and we will only ever have a finite amount of time in our lives to expend towards our various endeavors. Every day, many different venues of activity and entertainment compete for our time. However, we ultimately have the agency to decide how to spend our time within reason and the constraints of our individual circumstances. I will end this thought with a hypothetical question which inverts my argument: if our free time is not valuable, why do so many forms of entertainment and advertising compete for it on a daily basis? Furthermore, how much money are those companies generating from the amount of time that you spend engaged with their products, digital or physical? My personal response to this hypothetical question is as follows: I believe that the old platitude, “time is money,” is likely true.",

        "text": "I've recently built up the courage to start job searching, though I have not applied for any yet, after years dealing with social anxiety, depression and abuse from my family. I wanted to get at least an entry level job to get away from my abusive family as quickly as possible, but a problem I have been facing is how do I explain never having a job at the age of 24 or not doing anything in the past 5 years (I left school in 2019). Any help would be very much appreciated, and thank you for your time to read this.",

But I find it so hard to forgive myself and to stop being so tough on myself. \n\nI feel all the time that I am a terrible sister. Especially because I used to be mean when I was younger. Also, I felt like my younger sister was ashamed of me for the past 2-3 years for other reasons. \nI do feel like a failure sometimes. I do feel like she look down on me. \n\nMaybe I’m just being a sad sack of self-pity. But these h the info are the truth. And others would say I’m being too harsh even my sister would say the same. But that’s just being nice. \nI do feel like a bad person many times. Idk",

I wana improve myself, not sure where to properly start.\n\nI want to improve my health, physically and mentally.\nI procrastinate most of the morning and I don’t like doing it. I am also having sleep issues for about a year due to anxiety (I sleep at 1~3 am ) which is one thing I started giving proper attention to at the moment. \n\nI have also decided to stop beating meat for this month and I hope to not watch 🟧⬛️ for a very long time cause I am realizing that it’s not for me. L\n\nI have tried gym 3 times and all the times it went the same way ; I see improvement with weight loss and then I get cocky start eating shit and stop seeing improvements, I don’t sleep properly as well.it is likely that there is some form of denial that I am not seeing in my self.\n\nI had a crush which I met like 3 times at a family event,had chance to ask out but I had no confidence and self love to ask her out (I am on the chunky side), I cried the last time I saw her knowing I won’t ever see her and decided I have to change for good. I have to love myself before I love others. I have to improve myself before I get with someone.\n\nSo tldr, I wana improve my health, physically and mentally. Improve self love and learn to not procrastinate . I don’t know where to get going. I have decided for now to fix my sleep and stop 🟧⬛️. Help I am lost.",
