        "text": "This was a few months ago. I had to drive the same 30 minute stretch of turnpike twice a day and it was divided by a toll plaza. There's a pretty distinctive curve to the right before the plaza i recognize very well. This day is sunny, its a normal day i see that curve, go through the toll, give the lady my $1.50 and keep driving. Now theres also a pretty distinctive curve to the right a little ways after, but after that one you can see a few exits and a water tower. So, i approach on the second curve just about a minute or two later and as i come around it i was completely shocked, the toll plaza was there. i felt light headed and fought the urge to pull over, gave the same lady the same $1.50 i had in my cupholder that i handed her before. I hadnt made note of time so i couldnt actually tell, but i have not been able to explain it. Coming around that curve everything felt exceptionally brighter for a few moments and i was overcome with that awful lingering deja vu feeling for the rest of the day.",

        "text": "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is my absolute favorite game.  I have invested hundreds of hours playing it over the years since it was first released.  Unfortunately, I had to sell my Xbox 360 about 6 months ago, and thus lost my access to my favorite game.\n\nAs some of you may know, the remastered special edition of Skyrim was released last month.  I've been dying to get my hands on it for my ps4 so that I could play it again.  Finally, this weekend, I got a copy.  I've only been playing it since yesterday, but I've noticed some.....differences.\n\nI know Bethesda, the studio that made the game, updated a lot of things about the game, but as far as I can find online, they made no changes to the game's actual content.  But folks, this is NOT the game I've spent 300+ hours playing.  Caves I know by heart have subtle differences.  Extra stretches of tunnel or a stack of boxes and crates and sacks where there never was any before.  And NPCs now say little things here and there that I've never heard them say before.  I don't have any detailed examples yet of the NPC speech because when those occurred they caught my attention and I just wrote them off as maybe they added back in bits of speech they had recorded but never added to the original finished game.  Now I'm not so sure.  I do know for certain that Embershard Mine was not the same.\n\nI feel so off kilter about these things.  This is NOT the game I know and love.  This is not my Skyrim.  I don't know what to do or how to feel about this.  Have any of you played the new game and noticed any differences not in the release notes about the special edition??",

        "text": "When I was a kid, my dad was visiting me from Georgia and took me on a ride in the mall. The ride had a screen and the ride tilted and shook based on what was going on in the screen. That night he flew home and realized he had lost $100. He called the mall and spoke to the ride operator, who said they had found it. He told me to tell my mom about it so we could go get the money and he said we could just keep it. So we did. \n\nAs the years passed, every time my mom and I visited the mall and passed by that ride (about once a year, sometimes twice), we'd mention the incident.  Just usually something as simple as \"oh remember when your dad dropped some money here?\" Well we went and visited the mall not too long ago and I brought up the incident when we passed the ride, like normal.  My mom frowned and said \"what? That never happened.\" I was really surprised so I said \"what do you mean?\"  She said \"Something like that never happened. That story makes no sense - he just so happened to call the operator who had it? And why would he tell us to keep the money instead of sending it back?\" \n\nAt that point I was like \"???\" since I wasn't expecting something that was a fairly routine remark to end up getting a reaction like that.  She was getting mad about it too and insisting that I was confused. I asked her how I could be confused and reminded her about the conversations we'd had over the years about it (she said she didn't remember them.) Eventually I told her to just drop it.  I think we were both pretty unsettled after that. \n\n\nShe doesn't have any memory problems that I know of. If she had just forgotten the incident that would be one thing, but to forget all those conversations is weird.",

I had a few notifications from Facebook, but didn't click on them. \n\nI began to think of this girl again. I went on Facebook and typed her name in and clicked on her page. \"Confirm Friend\" was an option. Immediately WTF popped into my mind. I clicked my notifications and she had just added me a few minutes earlier...\n\n\nSo you're telling me this obscure girl from high school just randomly decided to add me on Facebook 5 years later within 24 hours of me thinking about her? Absolutely fucking not. We are definitely in some kind of simulation and are being mocked by shit like this.",

When we got home I played with it for a while on a little toy desk I had. I remember vividly because it had grooves that would allow me to slide my toy cars around it like a little race track. After playing with it this way for a while, I sat it in one of the grooves and went to the couch to watch TV. Some random amount of time later I returned to play with it, and there was an identical orange toy tow truck; same size, color, and everything just sitting there right behind it on the desk. Somehow it just duplicated itself and became two. I still have both of them in a box somewhere. ",

I panicked and started scooting backwards afraid of catching fire, then more small fireworks were shot at me, all the time the girls and my brother were all laughing. I started crying and went home, my mother asked what was wrong I said \"Dawson is stealing my friends.\" Mom just said we can both share friends. My brother comes home an hour later crying because he had a burn on his hand, mom asked where it came from, he sold me out and said we were playing with fireworks, mom was pissed and had us show her where we were playing, we led her to the ally next to the house but nothing was there, no girls, no lighters, no fireworks, not even spent husks. Mom insisted we give her whatever lighters we had, but we had none, neither me or my brother ever saw the girls again, and I had these memories for longer than the \"twin-girls-in-nightgowns\" was a popular ghost.

        "text": "I was 15 at the time and I was couch surfing between my then girlfriends house and some of my friends houses. Now, I'll be clear from the start, I have never dreamt. I know that everyone dreams, however, I have never remembered mine or even been remotely aware that I have dreamt.\n\nAnyway, around this time I was very suicidal. I had a dream, it was horrific. In my dream I was walking across a bridge with all these people, and I decided I was going to dive into it. This was very much like me at the time; random, spontaneous, and generally not giving a fuck about shit.\n\nI walked up to a tall beam on this bridge and for some reason, I took off my shoes, socks, watch, beanie, shirt, and I laid all of my possessions out very neatly transversely from the beam I was planning to jump from. This was fun, I was showing off. I stood there ready to jump, then at the last minute I decided to switch it up a little bit.\n\nI decided to swan dive, but not in an orthodox manner. I figured, \"you know what would be fucking rad? If I swan dived backwards\". This bridge was maybe 15m to 20m(60ft) above the water. So, I lined myself up backwards, one arm with an enclosed fist pointing straight up and the other just hanging beside me. I jumped, trying to pull off some semi-backflip to land in the water. I hit the water so fast, I sank so quickly. It was black. Just... Black. I could feel the bubbles roll up and off my face. I was cold, disoriented. I was dizzy, I couldn't find my way to the surface.\n\nI panicked. Thrashed around, feeling every bit of water resistance. I was still disoriented, however, my panic subsided. Serenity washed over me. Flooded my soul, almost. I was no longer fighting it. I became incredibly warm and my eyes widened. I felt a burning sensation in my chest that rose to my oesophagus, and then was extinguished like that of a candle. \n\nI became so calm and it was so peaceful. I was just floating there, at peace with my situation. My vision started to 'fuzz out' from the outside-in. It was similar to the static we see on the television. Except that fuzzy vision became a fuzzy feeling that consumed my body. I was numb, blind, unable to breathe... But I was so welcoming of this. This was it. My time.\n\nI awoke to my then girlfriend screaming at me and violently shaking me. I woke up so acutely aware of my surroundings and completely in-tune with myself. I remember myself taking a giant gasp of air the moment I awoke. The strange thing was, I was completely covered in water. I was sweating, yes, however, my side of the bed was completely soaked. It was as if someone threw a bucket of water over me. I ended up vomiting and it was so watered down too. It was so strange.\n\nSuddenly, everything dawned on me. Fear overwhelmed me and I became so shaken by this ordeal. I was too scared to go back to sleep. I stayed awake for the rest of the night and I didn't sleep the next night either. My girlfriend said to me the next day that the reason she woke me up was because I stopped breathing and that she couldn't wake me up for around 2 minutes. And let me tell you, when I woke up and gasped for air, it sure damn felt like I hadn't been breathing for 2 minutes. \n\nThis has been the most vivid dream/out of body experience I have ever had. Even to this day I don't remember my dreams. But that one, that one rocked me to my core. It was so real. I am not sur eif this is the right place to post this, but, I'm going to give it a shot.",

I have had a very glitchy life so I'm happy to have found this place. \n\nFirst incident is the nail polish. When I was about 13 or 14 lived in a house where weird things happened all the time but this was the weirdest. I was sitting in my room on the floor with my back against the wall reading. My book was in my lap so I was leaning over, there were no windows behind me and I was facing the door. Out of nowhere I felt something smack me straight in the back of the head, it felt like someone threw it at me. I reached behind me and found nail polish that I didn't own was what hit me. To be clear it didn't hit me on the top of the head, it hit me in the center of the back of my head which was facing the wall. Never been able to explain that one. \n\nThe broken lock,  this one happened earlier this week. The house I'm in now I've lived in for 2 1/2 years and within the first month of moving in I managed to break the lock on our bathroom door. It was around 3 in the morning when I got up to use the bathroom, I wasn't asleep and had yet to go to bed. So when I go to leave the bathroom door has locked from the inside. I turned the lock back and forth a few times and the door knob still wouldn't move. I just stood there for at least 3 minutes turning the lock until the door opened. I told my girlfriend what happened and since then I don't think the bathroom door has been shut. \n\nThe time it wasn't me. This takes place when I was 16, in a different but still weird house than the nail polish story. I was home alone with my mom one afternoon when I heard her talking to someone in the hallway out side of my room. I thought she was talking to the dogs at first but the more I listened the more it sounded like a conversation. Me being an antisocial teenager I cracked my door open to see if someone came over. Instead I saw my mom in the hallway talking to me. I froze for a second and my mom turned her back to do something, then I opened my door and asked my mom who she was talking to. She turned around and asked me how I got to my room so quickly. When I told her I have been in my room all afternoon she just shrugged it off as \"Oh that's weird\" and never spoke of it again. \n\nI've got more stories I'll post later on, they're longer so they'll get their own posts. I'm cool with any theories you guys have, especially about the nail polish because that still fucks me up sometimes. ",

        "text": "Maybe 15 times in the last 5 years,  I've dreamed of this very old house.  The house is haunted and there are horrible things in it,  and since the first dream every time I dream about it,  when I see it I think \"this is the house from my dreams! I can't go in here!\" But I always end up having to for some reason.  The house is always exactly the same,  and I recognize it immediately.  As an example of the bad things in the house,  one room is full of baby dolls that came alive and came after me.  One was in an old 1800's wicker stroller.  Another time,  a dead man ripped my necklace off my neck and said \"Oh you NEED this!\" Then shoved me out the window.  (My necklace has been blessed numerous times and I've never taken it off). Anyway I always make it out and wake up.  So recurrent dreams,  not very glitchy. Here's the fucked up thing. \n\nAbout 3 years ago (2 years after the house dreams began) my mother went on bacon to Maine (we live in ny) and bought me a copy of a book about haunted places in NY. I wasn't really interested So I stuck it on my bookshelf,  and forgot I even had it until last summer.  I decided to netting it with me to read at the pool.  I'm pretty far into the book,  which shows the name and picture of each haunted house,  with a story underneath.  I literally... and I do mean literally... peed in my bathing suit a little when I turned the page and there,  in black and white,  with the wicker carriage from my nightmare with a baby in it,  is the house from my nightmare.  I recognized some of the people in the photo from my dreams.  The story went on to talk about how the baby according to history died, which might explain the room of baby dolls.  It is in a town about 2.5 hours away,  that I've never even heard of much less been to.  \n\nI don't know how to put a picture on here,  or I would share a photo from the book.  I always thought I was just having a recurrent dream,  but the house actually exists and I've never seen it before or knew it existed aside in my dreams. This is a big glitch for me.",

        "text": "After the second instance, I started to wonder if anybody else has had experience(s) similar to mine recently and if so, what their thoughts were regarding it. If not, any comments/thoughts are welcome. \n\nAbout three weeks ago I went to the gym around 11 at night and as I was adjusting my rings (which I probably do about ten times a day unknowingly) I noticed the one on my left index finger was MIA. Note that this ring has been on for over a year and has never fallen off/gone missing. About a week goes by and I still hadn’t found it nor has it popped up anywhere. Later that night (same night as when I ‘lost’ it the week prior) I was laying in bed about to go to sleep, went to adjust my rings (per usual) and the ring I ‘thought’ I had lost was back on the same left index finger! And I’m not crazy...nor was drunk or on drugs (have been sober for some time now). I never found the ring and put it on unknowingly... I never even found the ring in general! When the ring ‘appeared’ back on my finger I laid there for about ten minutes wondering what and how that had just happened...what really makes me wonder is HOW it ended up on the exact same finger so perfectly, with no effort of me putting it back on (or even finding it!!)\n\nSo I thought that was just a bizarre, freak event that happened. But then last weekend, another situation occurred that really makes me wonder if theres some weird physic activity in my aura or something (I know, it sounds silly). \n\nThe second strange instance occurred last Friday at a bar. Went out for a friend’s birthday to a new bar and new place I’ve never been to before. I started talking to this guy sitting at the bar where I was waiting for my drink and right away he reminded me of my cousin (&amp; sort of looked like my cousin’s dad) who passed away when I was a little girl. We were probably 45 seconds into a small-talk conversation when I (word vomited, sort of) randomly asked if his name was Jason (my cousin’s name) and sure enough, he said yes.  He laughed a little and started questioning me how I knew who he was. I didn’t believe him so I asked to see his ID to prove his name is actually Jason, and it was! I told him I really didn’t know...the name Jason just came to me &amp; I had no further explanation.... and still don’t! \n\nAny thoughts?",

        "text": "My glitch experiences have been piling up for awhile because I never knew where to post them -- I didn't even know it was a thing (apart from myself) until fairly recently. Although I have an open mind, I am also very analytical and introspective. I am not liable to believe things unless I have come to a rational conclusion about them on my own. The things I will relate here are true, on my word as an ethical person. The first one is a little long, because I want to make sure I'm clear.\n\nOkay, the most obvious and straightforward glitch was this: I go once a week and help an older friend of mine with various things \naround the house. He is an old radio buff, and he has a mountain of tubes, radios, parts, etc. in his house, basement and garage. So a couple weeks ago, we decided to gather up all the various loose radio speakers and consolidate them in one place. In his basement, he has a cubbyhole that is very deep -- it goes way back into the wall. There was a half-shelf in the top third of it; i.e., there is vertically room for two shelves, but only the back half of the top shelf is there. He wants to cut another half-shelf to put in front of it, and two more half-shelves to make a bottom shelf. He's got two planks that we are going to have to cut the three half-shelves from. They are each about twice as long as we need. I was in the house getting my smokes, and I heard him outside using the table saw. I went down to the basement just as he is coming in with one half-shelf that he had just cut. We go over to the cubby, and he puts the half-shelf in front of the half that's already there, but it doesn't quite fit. He says, \"Oh man, am I gonna have to cut this again?\"\n\nSince we had already done some other work that day and it was around two p.m., he said, \"Fuck it. I'm hungry. Let's eat.\" Mind you, I was right behind him, and had watched him try to fit the cut piece of wood into the cubby, in front of the other shelf. So we left the second half-shelf there wedged in front of the original one, went upstairs and had pizza and talked for awhile. We came back downstairs to get the half-shelf and recut it -- and there was only the one half-shelf that had always been there. No sign of any other cut piece of wood. There was, however, a plank leaning against something, that was not there before. It was the original, uncut plank. The other uncut plank was outside by the saw. No shelf had ever been cut.  But I heard him use the saw, I saw him with the cut shelf, and I saw him leave it in the cubby. We were both acutely aware that this was a clear discontinuity.\n\nThe other two things will be harder to believe, but again, I swear they are true and I was not high or anything when they occurred.\n\nOne: I was riding my bicycle down the street one morning. I looked up at the sky, and I saw what looked like a faded purplish view of a zeppelin off in the distance. It was very large and at an acute slant to the horizon, as if it were crashing. It could not have been an unusual cloud formation, although it was morning cloud colored (faded purples, pinks and yellows) because it was far too detailed. It looked exactly like a picture of the famous Hindenberg disaster. I looked around wildly to find someone to corroborate it, but the \nstreet was empty. I stood there straddling my bike staring at it until finally I really had to be on my way. When I looked up again, it was gone. Naturally I did not have my phone on me.\n\nTwo: One day I was in my room just chilling. I live in a major urban area, and it is never quiet here. There are trucks and cars, sirens at the nearby hospital, dogs barking, people shouting, everything. Suddenly I heard all the ambient sounds, as one, slow down and come to a halt. With that Doppler-shift drop in pitch, like a huge motor or machine slowing down and stopping. Then I heard that sound in reverse as everything started up again. It was as if someone had cut the power to reality for a second. (or cycled the power switch - a hot reboot.)",

I sat down whilst the kettle was on and made some jokes about it being pretentious and tried to google why they would have it dialogue free but keep the actors lips moving in the frame. There was sounds of the street, trains, cars, etc. added in but no dialogue, so imdb the BBC website, nothing. No one had even mentioned it. \n\nThere apparently is vocals on it, and when we went back to check there was totally voice acting in it. It just shut off for only us for about an hour.",

And this isn't just a case of a faulty memory, because as the scene happened and they started saying the lines, I could finish them before they did, I KNEW what they were going to say.\n\nAt first I assumed that maybe the person was an insider or something all along, but when googling, NOTHING has come up about it and you'd think someone else would have noticed.\n\nUnfortunately I don't have any proof to back-up my claim since Doctor Who TV removed the comment sections a few months ago, but this is seriously strange.",

We were standing by some cars waiting for a friend to come out before leaving. At this point I really had to take a piss but there was someone in the bathroom inside so my friend dared me to piss on the car. I don't take lightly to challenges so long story short, I pissed on the car. I notice a huge black man inside the store stand up so I cut off stream, zip up and start to walk away. Him and his whole squad come running out, so me and my friends start booking it across the street through a little forest area. I knew I was the culprit so I pretty much left my friends in the dust. I came out to a little clearing between the forest where there was a gas station. My plan was to run behind the building to get to the other side back in to the woods, but at soon as I jumped over the wall in to the open space, the car pulls in and three guys hop out and start bullying me around. I didn't exactly get jumped but they did push me around a little bit, I admitted I fucked up, apologized, let him take $40 out of my wallet and then I walk about 2 miles home to ponder my mistake. I noticed after a while that my maroon beanie wasn't on my head anymore. It must've fell off at the gas station. I have 7 or 8 other beanies in assorted colors.\nI knew I didn't have that beanie anymore and I never went and bought another one. This was about 2 years ago. Since then, I've moved out of my parents house, and then moved again. I still thought about the missing beanie sometimes when I picked out a certain outfit. I know this for a fact because I would be wearing maroon shoes with a certain shirt and I would wish that I still had that beanie to top off the style.\nWELL... tonight as I was picking out my outfit for tomorrow... what do I find? A fucking maroon colored beanie, right at the bottom of my stack of beanies..",

Many believe in it's existence, many people speculate on it, many people have alleged accounts of there being glitches in it's operation but I've yet to hear about anyone glimpsing *it* itself. \n\nNow I cant say for sure what it is that I perceive but every now and again I perceive *something* stranger than fiction. I see Grid Lines. I can't control it, and I can't stop it when it happens, but when it happens, it happens after I wake up. Usually when it's still dark and not sunny.\n\nIt's not just flat lines in front of my vision either. It's as if the world before me is rendered into a three dimensional grid of perfect cubes that encompass everything, whose colors and lines are a spectral grey or other non color. And they seem to pulse, and thrum with vibrational energy. Sooner or later though, sometimes seconds, sometimes minutes after the onset of the vision, the lines and grid all fade away and \"reality\" becomes solid and unquestionable again.\n\nWhat do you think about this?",

        "text": "Hello all, I've been listening to this Youtube channel for the last month or so, that has stories like the ones here and decided to share something that happened to me quite some years ago and still creeps me out. I start by saying I have no history of mental illness of any kind and live an happy life, no major problems, when this happened I was about 16 to 18, it was a really long time ago :) and back then life was even less stressful, I say this to put aside the explanation of hidden fears or stress manifesting in some way or form.\n\nNow for the story itself.\n\nI live in Portugal and was on vacation on my grandmothers house in a small village in the northern interior of the country, the kind of place where at night, you can hear a pin drop across the street such is the silence. Let me explain the layout of the house, it's relevant, it's a small two story house, on the lower floor there are 3 rooms, one is vacant, on another sleeps my gran and my sister and the third is mine, on the top floor there is a kitchen, a living room and a dinning room that has been temporarily changed to be my parents room. I was deep asleep after a normal day when suddenly I'm awoke by the sound of very loud screaming and sobbing tears, later thinking about it, it reminded me of the description of the sound made by a Banshee, followed by rushed footsteps in the direction of the stairs like someone was coming down from the upper floor and falling down the wooden stairs making an awful noise and then, nothing, I even remember feeling the vibration caused by the impact on the floor (but as I said this was a long time ago and our memory sometimes creates realities that never existed), my first thought was that something terrible had happened to my parents and my sister went up for a glass of water or something and saw whatever had happened, rushed down and feel. My eyes where wide open looking into the darkness of the corridor and I realised there is no light on in the house and no one had been woken by the ruckus. I felt my blood turn to ice in my veins (figuratively), closed my eyes, covered myself as best I could with the blankets and laid in bed for quite a long time running every kind of scenario of what just happened in my mind for what seemed like hours scared out of my wits, there was no way I was the only one hearing that, by the time I fell asleep the sun was already peeking in above the mountain and some birds where singing.\nLater when my parents came to wake us and we where all in the living room I asked if someone had heard some noise or something unusual the past night and the response was no from everyone.\n\nAgain, that thing scared the living crap out of me and I was afraid to go to my room alone for the rest of my vacations, it felt and sounded as real as it could get.\n\nNothing else happened, no tragedies, no special events, nothing worthy of an \"omen\".\n\nWas it just case of hipper active imagination? A ghost or echo of something that happened previously or that will happen? A glimpse into another universe or timeline where something really happened?\nI guess I'll never know and I not actually reaching for some sort of closure, but I decided to share the story and maybe ear some kind of theory or similar story from someone.\n\nThank you for reading.",

Had license plate number of the car I would be driving, what route I was to take, etc. Weird details about things. One thing in particular is it said AVOID AMARILLO. When I looked at it the next day it was back to typical rental contract, full of legalese. Fast forward 3 years later, and my sister had moved to Tennessee, and I was moving there to be closer to her &amp; my 2 nieces. I was driving from the bay area (CA) to Knoxville, and was heading into Texas. I see a sign for Amarillo, and that weird rental contract popped back into my head. I pulled over, looked at my license plate, and realized the car, license, etc was exactly as in that contract. I decided to get through texas as quick as possible, was majorly freaked out. I get pulled over for a cop for speeding, he's convinced I'm on something (I'm not) and arrests me. I'm sitting in a holding cell, in Amarillo TX, there's a TV on just outside the cell... It's playing one of The Matrix movies, the scene where they're getting on an elevator \"Trinity: Maybe we did something wrong.\nNeo: Or didn't do something.\nMorpheus: No, what happened, happened and couldn't have happened any other way.\nNeo: How do you know?\nMorpheus: We are still alive.\"\n\n5 minutes later, the cop that arrested me comes in and opens the cell, says that they don't have any way to care for my cat (who had been in the back of my car), and that I was free to go. Got back in my car and finished the trip with no further issues. \n\nI read my future in a rental contract, failed to heed it's warning, got arrested, saw a ridiculously relevant scene from The Matrix, and was released, saved by a cat.

        "text": "Okay. So I've been a lurker for a while and been reading some stories similar to one of my own experiences from when I was younger. Some background: I have a semi-photographic memory, can lucid dream and never took or done any drugs in my life. I thought this would be the appropriate place to write my story. \n\n\n\n\nWell when I was about 4 or 5, my family used to live in apartments and my mom was making my brothers and I lunch. We all sat at the table waiting for my mom to finish and give us the food. I sat on the inside of the table and where the table was placed is near a window, so being young and curious I would just stare out the window and look at all the people walking around the courtyard. At one point, I saw a neighbor that I would play with walking with her brother and I waved and yelled out her name, as she looked up and wave back I just feel myself fall through the screen of the window and that's when everything was in slow-mo. As I fall, I see an ambulance and fire truck in the distance and then I feel myself getting ripped out of my body and I see myself falling. Then, when I hit the concrete, I just see my body laying there and then I get snapped back to my body and everything went black. \n\n\n\nI remember that while I was falling, that no one was around the courtyard and it just seemed like forever till I reached the ground but I remember falling on my head because of the way I fell out of the window. \nWe lived on the 2nd floor of the apartments and even though to some 2 stories isn't that high I fell on my head and in most cases I should have died. Well, when I woke up, I was in the hospital with a bump on my forehead the size of a golf ball. My mom told that I landed on a guy and he didn't notice me and I crashed down to him, my upper half of my body hit the grass area and my bottom half on him and the concrete. I told her that no one was there when I fell and she freaked out saying how do I know and I just casually tell her that I saw myself fall. \nNow I don't know if she's telling the truth or if I was just dreaming but in my opinion, I shouldn't even be alive right now. To this day, I have constant headaches in the same areas since the fall and every year I get scans to make sure nothing is there and so far I'm still clean from anything but it doesn't explain the headaches, and also since then up until I was 16, I saw people and things that weren't there (well that's what people around me say). Also, sometimes when I dream there's been dreams from my past till now that are what people call *dream deja-vu*, like there was one dream where I'm in high school, and go to this new school and tke this assessment test and get a tour of the school. Then 2 years later, it's like deja-vu and I'm at the school and everything is the same as in my dream. I don't know if that's connected to the fall or not but I thought I should put that in.\n",

When she handed it back to me one of the buttons had come out of the socket and I could not find it anywhere. I asked all my friend and none of them knew I thought it was sabotage. But I gave up and knew that I would never be able to button my neck pillow ever again. Later about 2 hours later into the bus ride I grab my neck pillow out of my backpack and put it around my neck. Did not try and button the neck because I knew there was no connector. I then looked down and there was a connector there, looking brand new. I clearly remember looking at the connector at the start of the bus ride and when it was handed back to me initially. What happened?",

For reference she passed away around 5 years ago (weird story around that which I will mention towards the end aswell). I will also refer to my great nan as my nan from now on.\n\nBack when my nan was allot younger (from what I have gathered 20-30 years old) she was very much superstitious, due to this allot of the family just wrote her off and laughed at the things she used to tell them. \n\nWhen it was getting closer to Christmas my nan started to have weird dreams and \"epiphany's\" about her cousins son, who was around 10 at the time. To start off it was nothing to crazy really, she just had a \"funny\" feeling about something, it was hard to explain. \n\nBy the time we get to Christmas eve my nan had had a \"final epiphany\", this led her to believe her cousins son was going to die if he stayed in her cousins house that night. \n\nNow this is something my mum has told me vividly plenty of times and I want to explain that it is very much a true story (atleast it is what I have been told) and my mum believes it very much, I never asked my nan about this out of respect.\n\nOn Christmas eve she called my cousin begging her to let her son stay at her house that night or else something \"bad\" would happen, obviously my nans cousin basically told her to go away and she was going to wake up with her son on Christmas and to stop being crazy. My nan would *not* let it go and was begging atleast they both stay over, her cousin refused.\n\nWithin 2 hours my nans cousin had gone to take a bath, where carbon monoxide began leaking into the room where he passed out and suffocated under water, he passed away on Christmas eve.\n\nNow I was never told what happened after as I was to creeped out to ask but I wanted to tell you guys as I think it is just a crazy crazy story and almost unbelievable.\n\nTo go back to what I mentioned at the beginning; I hadn't seen my nan in about 6-8 months, however the weekend before she died she asked me and my little brother to go for a meal with her, my mum and my \"real nan\" (her daughter). This was weird but we just thought that seeing family is normal so she probably just missed us. Although now I reflect it was kind of out of nowhere, my mum was raised in her household and was very close to my nan so I personally believe she knew she was going to pass away so wanted to see her daughter and my mother. However she never mentioned that she may die, but maybe she didn't want people to know, I guess we will never know.",

The book I read had a huge impact on me at the young age I was when I read it, and I remember the book fairly clearly. I was discussing the book with a friend, and we were both baffled by the other's version of events. We hadn't read the same book, and I can find no book that matches the description of what I read back then. I'll give a summary of the plot of whatever I read, to see if any of you read anything similar. \n\nThe book started out in what my friend said was the same way-- some dude gets hired to write an aging scientist's biography before he kicks the bucket. The scientist had been involved in nuclear testing in tropical islands in the South Pacific. That's where the similarities end. The biographer travels to the island almost immediately, acquainting himself with the very few residents, all of whom were family members or workers in the scientists guy's home, with perhaps a few natives, but I can't precisely remember how many. So bio guy gets to digging through the mounds of files that science dude has on the island, getting info for the biography, as well as getting to know the scientist's daughter, Kitty, and learning of a case of a feral woman who was once under the care of the scientist, who firmly believed she was a cat. Meanwhile, he starts thinking something fishy is going on because the scientist just kind of disappears a lot, for hours at a time, and a lot in the files that he's researching are posing a lot of questions. So this goes on for a while, before Mr. science lets bioguy know that he didn't actually bring him to the island to do a biography!! Bioguy ends up going down 13 steps after getting the number in a note from Mr. science, finding the secret basement lair where Mr. science has been keeping 5(?) people in secret. They had been hit by a nuclear blast as infants, leaving them with severely reduced mental capacity, deformities, and an intolerance to sunlight. Science man would bring them out for moonlight picnics, I remember. Anyhow, the care of these folks, now in their 20s or 30s but still with the minds of children was to be left in bioguy's hands. Once that happens, though, he has them shipped off the island in special no-sun boxes and put in other no-sun boxes before some sceintists?? Politicians?? This part is a little fuzzy, but he was using their existence to prove a point or strengthen an argument or something. The book wraps up with bioguy wondering  about Kitty and her identity, and if she had anything to do with the feral catwoman. \n\nHas anyone read anything akin to this at all? Is it another book entirely and I'm just remembering the wrong title and author? Did I run across some serious Cat's Cradle fanfiction? Please let me know what you think. ",

        "text": "So we've all experienced deja vu before, but what I just experienced was one of the most intense and baffling thing that I really can't explain. \n\nI was sleeping when I got a long message from my friend, it was about many things about how she feels she is  a screw up, not good at her job, among other things. As I was reading it it hit me like a train. That I had 100% no doubt that we for sure had already had this same exact conversation last week (it may have been two weeks ago, but regardless, I know for a fact that we did.) \n\nI even asked her if she had accidentally sent me the same message from before on accident, she said she had no idea what I was talking about . I was about to say that the only thing that was different was that the last time she sent me this message she face timed me as well, and sure enough before I sent that message, she faced time me. I knew she was about to say that she couldn't talk long because she was sleepy and she didn't want to wake her parents up... she said that too. \n\nI immediately felt this rush of uncomfortable panic and chills. I sent her a response of reassurance but my phone glitched up when I sent it to her and screwed up the format and grammar JUST LIKE THE LAST TIME. And I had to correct it, JUST LIKE THE LAST TIME. \n\nIt's like I had literally slipped back into the past, I even checked to make sure it was the same month, and apologized if I made it about it. I tried scrolling up to older messages in my texts (this time it was on fb messenger) but just tonight, but I had just turned on my phone setting to delete messages 30 days or older earlier today because of course. So it was gone. \n\nIt freaked me out so badly that I woke up my mom nearly in tears because I honestly can't explain it. I looked up waking seizures, or inner ear infections, and found some accounts of deja vu, but nothing to the extent of what I experienced. \n\nI'm still really shaken up and had to take a couple klonopin because of it. Is there some kind of other explanation for this? Has anyone else experienced something like this?\n\nWHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED! ?\n\np.s. Even my response of reassurance I remembered verbatim from the last time, but another difference was that instead of her saying it made her feel better, she just said that she loved me and was passing out. Also when I went to re-read what i sent her, everything had vanished (my message of reassurance to her I mean.) Which has never happened before either. I asked if she had just received messages from me and she said yes. \n\nSeriously, I'm spooked. My mom did say though that now if it happens again I will have proof because I told her. \n\nI can't get over how bizarre this is. ",

        "text": "Background:  My current auto insurance policy ends on October 21st and I've decided not to renew.  I plan to switch companies when that one expires on the 21st.  I had this concretely decided in my head, but hadn't taken any action or told anyone yet.\n\nFrom Sept. 31-Oct. 2 (a couple weeks ago) I was on a remote ranch in another state, with about 20 friends, hanging out for the weekend.  We were miles and miles from any cell service or internet; everyone's phone was totally useless.  We all just turned them off and left them in our cars.\n\nToday I received some mail from my current insurance company confirming that my account has been cancelled, as of October 1st, by phone call.  They will shortly be refunding me $103 (I had paid in advance thru Oct. 21, so this is the difference, in cash, since \"I cancelled\" on Oct. 1).  \n\nBut I didn't.  I couldn't have made a phone call if my life depended on it on October 1st, and I certainly wasn't thinking about insurance that day.  No one else has access to my auto insurance policy, and no one else has enough information to pose as me successfully anyway.  There's no reason or motivation for anyone to do this either.  But the insurance company has paperwork with the date of termination on it, and it's noted that the policy was cancelled by phone, full authorization.  I am (I was QUITE surprised to learn today) uninsured at present.\n\n???????????\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "As I said on the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/57ejn1/something_happened_in_the_sky_above_long_island/), this story is something I've wanted to tell on the internet for a long time, but couldn't quite find the proper venue for it. After posting on /r/Thetruthishere , someone suggested that the readers here might have some ideas/enjoy it. \n\nI am looking for as much feedback as I can get, as my searching throughout the internet has turned up absolutely nothing - no similar stories as far as I can tell. Hopefully, someone will have some suggestions, and can help me understand what the hell I experienced over 2 decades ago now.\n\nEverything you are about to read is 100% true, told as faithfully as I can, and elaborated to the best of my ability.\n\n***\n\nI'm not sure of my exact age at the time, but I can narrow it down to 6 or 7 based on what grade I was in at school, and that I was still an only child. \n\n\n\nAt that age (and embarrassingly, until about age 13) my mom was very strict about my bedtime of 8:30. Because of this, I always woke up very early in the morning without any need of coaxing. On school days, I'd normally get up at 5:30 and eat breakfast while watching old episodes of Thundercats. But, the day in question was a Saturday and Thundercats didn't come on on Saturdays. \n\nSaturday morning was strictly for video games.\n\nI woke up early, just like any other day. I remember sneaking past my mom's room to our kitchen through the hallway. There were no lights on in the house, nor were there windows in the hallway, but the living room just ahead was slightly lit with the grey glow of an early morning. As I passed through the living room, I noticed the curtains on all the windows were closed still, like they usually were at night. (This is a VERY important detail to remember.)\n\nNothing unusual happened as I popped my pop-tarts. Nothing jumped out at me as I returned to my bedroom. I just closed the door quietly and went about my business.\n\nI sat my food on the top bunk for a moment before reaching down to the floor for the Blockbuster copy of \"Donkey Kong\" (that part is vivid to me. memory is strange.) and blew the dust out of it. As the game loaded, I turned away from the TV to grab the pop tarts off my bed. As I felt around on my sheets nonchalantly, I couldn't locate them. I had to take a step up the built-in ladder to get a better look, and saw that I had tossed them to the far side of the mattress, near the wall.\n\nTheir landing place, near the end of the bed, was where the wall ended and the window began. [Much like this,](http://memorabledecor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Splendid-Dinosaur-Bedding-For-Boys-Decorating-Ideas-Images-in-Kids-Eclectic-design-ideas-.jpg) but where the green cloth on the wall to the left is, there is a window.\n\nAnd as I reached out to grab my tiny breakfast squares, I looked out that window. \n\nI remember every detail from here on out with great clarity. \n\nUnlike the windows of the living room, mine were not covered completely. They looked like the [blue curtains here](http://documentsx.celuce.com/content-images-thumbs/0001191_blue_lantern_swags_and_pelmet_valance_curtain_drapes.jpeg), but had dinosaurs on them (my sheets were matching to these too!) - but nothing covering the majority of the window. That said, I don't know how I didn't notice what was going on outside before that moment.\n\n**The entire sky was a sickly yellow, and it was...low to the ground.** It gave off a light of its own, completely unlike the sun. Unlike any sort of light I've seen since. It was all pervading, but gentle too. \n\nI could look right at it, and it didn't hurt my eyes.\n\nThat sounds bizarre, but I don't know how else to put it. When I've told this story in the past, people have said, \"The sky is yellow all the time when the sun comes up.\" It wasn't like that. It was a yellow like the [windows in this photo](http://www.reflectiv.com/_services/media.php?image_id=5244&amp;type=photo&amp;default=). I've described the appearance like this in the past: You know the old projectors that teachers used to use? You know the transparency sheets they'd put on them? It was like THAT, but yellow. A vibrant, though not quite neon, yellow. It *WAS NOT* transparent though. It was opaque, but only about 99% opaque. It was like I could tell there was something beyond the color, beyond the form (whatever it was) even though I couldn't see through it.\n\nThe \"low to the ground\" is even weirder. Have you ever been out on a rainy or cloudy day and felt like the clouds were extremely close? Like you could throw a rock upwards and it might disappear into them? It was like that, and had a similar appearance and perceived texture. But, when you look at a cloudy sky, you can see clear delineations between clouds. Shades of lighter and darker areas, and, especially in storms, movement. They aren't stationary is what I mean. \n\nBut this was. \n\n**It didn't move, or bend, or show any signs of being a cloud.**\n\nAs I looked out that window, I did not immediately feel fear like I would if I saw it again now. I don't know what I felt, to be honest. I was still in that strange in-between. A twilight age where the boundaries of physics are loosely understood, but not clearly defined. The sight I was seeing did not strike me as impossible then. It struck me as marvelous, and dangerous. I was raised a mile from the ocean. It was dangerous in the way I knew a riptide to be dangerous. \n\nRiptides, however, did not stop me from swimming.\n\nAnd that's why I went outside.\n\nI basically ran to the front door, but after stepping out onto the porch - I never left it. I had intended to go out into the grass of the yard, but I just stopped dead in my tracks, my neck craned upwards, jaw probably agape.\n\nThe feeling was so sudden. I went from excitement to...I don't know...terror? That's probably the right way to describe it. It felt the same way it does when you realize the riptide has you. You aren't a strong enough swimmer to get away. \n\nIt felt like going under.\n\n\nThat sky...*fuck*. It seemed like it was just barely above the roof of my house. A single story ranch. The **ENTIRE** sky stopped a foot above my chimney. And it was no longer a dome, or the half-dome that it normally is. It was *flat*, flat as the horizon beyond waves looks from a tall dune. It just went on and on. This wasn't a localized phenomenon, as far as I could tell. Everywhere I looked was uniform and flat and yellow and opaque. \n\nA singular mass that, as far as I knew, or know now, WAS the sky. \n\n***But where was the light coming from?***\n\nRemember earlier when I said that the curtains in the living room being closed was an important detail? Think back on that now. The sun had been coming up then. At least, I think it had. I KNOW the room was illuminated with the dull glow of early morning. It had made the room look grey, like it did every morning. Why didn't the room appear to have a yellow glow, from the yellow sky? I hadn't noticed any strange lighting in my room either - partially the reason I think that I didn't notice it until I looked directly out the window.\n\nSo what was I seeing? Was the light it emanated even yellow, or was ***it*** just yellow?\n\nI couldn't see anything through the flat mass that was now the sky. It could have been noon or midnight and it would have looked exactly the same. I could be wrong, but it just seemed as though the light itself came from *the sky itself*. It lit everything outside up clearly, but faintly. Like the light of a full moon. The light didn't *FEEL* yellow, if that makes sense. And, as I said, the light coming through my windows just seemed like early morning light. Still, EVERYTHING was uniformly illuminated. As uniform as...whatever the fuck it was that I saw that day.\n\nAfter staring for a while, I just went back inside, feeling a little dazed, but scared too. I went to my mom's room, where she was asleep with the man who would soon become my step-father. I remember climbing onto the bed, and I even remember the shirt he was wearing: It was the black T-shirt that came with the \"[Illusion of Gaia](https://www.videogameauctions.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/illusion-of-gaia-tshirt.jpg)\" for [SNES](http://www.gamesniped.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/illusion-of-gaia-snes-t-shirt-sealed.jpg) - we had just gotten it a few weeks before. Anyway, I woke my mom up, and did my best to explain what was going on outside. She probably didn't believe me (or maybe even completely understand what I was saying), of course, and I had to try for a few minutes to get her up. When she finally did wake, she was annoyed, and swore that I'd be in huge trouble if I was waking her up for no good reason.\n\nBut, as she marched up to the living room window, she pulled back the curtains...and saw it too. I remember her saying a few startled things like, \"What is that? Is a storm coming? Oh my god, I think tornado's change the sky's color. Oh my god, do we need to go to the basement? What is that? Are those clouds?\" She seemed panicky, and she ran back to her bedroom with me in tow to wake up the step-dad. \n\nI remember her shaking him awake. I remember him jumping up and acting tough, like he was won't to do. She guided him to the front door, and I watched as she pulled it open.\n\n**It was fucking gone.** \n\nAcross the street, in between my neighbors trees, I could see the sun coming up like a blood orange. The sky was faintly blue, and there were some wispy clouds. But it wasn't overcast. \n\nHe told her she must have been dreaming, and she seemed frustrated. I just stood there, confused, and still kind of scared. I remember he grabbed my moms hand and pulled her back towards the bedroom, and her protesting that she wasn't dreaming. She said she'd just seen some kind of weird storm outside. He picked her up in his arms in a flirting manner, and whisked her down the hall. She made eye contact with me as I stood there at the end of the hall, and her eyes seemed wild. \n\nTheir door closed.\n\nAnd that was it. I went back to my room, and played Donkey Kong most of the morning until we left to go to up-Island to visit some family that afternoon.\n\nI remember it all so clearly. \n\n***\n\nI've asked my mom if she remembers this many times throughout my life. She tells me \"vaguely\", and seems unsure of herself. My now former step-father, however, DOES remember the morning in question. But he didn't see it happen. He just remembers my mom and I waking him up to come look outside at the sky, and seeing nothing there.\n\nI know some will suggest this was a dream, and I've considered it too - but how does my ex-step-father remember the morning? My mom, like I said, only recalls a stormy sky, or something to that effect, if anything at all. I still remember many dreams from childhood - and this WAS NOT one of them.\n\nSo, what did I see in the sky above Long Island? I have no idea, but I hope someone here might. Do I have any theories? Yes and no. I don't know. I just know that I've looked high and low around the internet and NOTHING remotely matches this description. I want to find out if anyone else has ever experienced anything like this.\n\nI'll be around frequently to answer questions, and to clarify anything I have overlooked or was inarticulate about. I welcome all the comments and help you can offer, and will try to respond to as many as I can. \n\n**Thanks for reading this!** And if nothing else, I hope it was entertaining in some way. The unexplained events of life usually are. \n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "About two years ago I was up late in bed on my phone, when a noise that sounded about as loud as a gunshot went off. I panicked of course and hid under the sheets (not my proudest moment). Although it was as loud as a gun going off, the noise sounded somewhat musical.\n\nMy music box, I figured. Maybe something broke inside of it (it's older than me) and caused it to snap and play the music way louder than it should've.. I told myself this repeatedly but still slept very badly that night.\n\nI only realized in the morning that the thing's been broken for years (after I took it apart out of curiosity once and never got it back in the right way).\n\nNot sure if glitch or not, but I believe I may have imagined the noise in my head? What's really terrifying is how loud it was, again it was like a gunshot from maybe 10-15 feet away. I know you can hallucinate sounds, but I've never had hallucinations as vivid as that, only minor things that everyone has sometimes (like hearing your phone go off when it's actually silent). Is there something that might've caused this to happen in my head? Or did my music box suddenly bring itself back to life?",

        "text": "I guess you could say I have a lot of secrets.  I have so many weird things that have happened, that when taken into consideration might make it seem like I'm in a real bad place... I considered posting these stories to or offmychest, and I posted to r/christianity but I figured here as there may be more open minded people here.  \n\nOne more quick caveat... I've told few very selective stories to friends in person, and they begged me to stop because they felt a presence come over them... judging them.  So this is part of what gives me pause in telling you. I need to tell these things because I'm desperate. \n\nI don't know where to start, so I'll start from the beginning.  When I was about 16 I was godless... I didn't care about anything and I listened to very angry satanic music.  I remember one time I was at work.  And I casually agreed to give myself to the devil.  There I said it... I didn't think anything of it really... just thought it was prudent.  why not? After all the devil was kind of like a cool rebel in my mind.   After years of struggling with my identity, depression and hopelessness I ended up giving my life to God due to family influence and prayer.  I felt incredibly hopeful and this could entail an entire book of its own.  \n\nBut anytime I thought about the devil I would get a pang of incredible fear come over me.  So much that I was paralyzed and my mother and sister were fearful for me thinking maybe they shouldn't have converted me.  Anyway over all I had many revelations of joy and comfort.  I learned so many things in such a short span of time that I felt I had lived a thousand years.  I prayed and meditated every day all day and was surrounded by like-minded people who also had amazing spiritual gifts and discernment.  \n\nFor example one time I would prayed and suddenly I sat up and yelled a friends name who I hadn't spoken to in years and right after he would call me.  He told me later that after that it was the best he'd ever felt in his life.  I was in hindsight, after a while, addicted to novelty I think.  I wanted to see something new!  To have a spiritual revelation or to feel something amazing.  So one night I'm praying and impatiently begging God for something! I'm slamming on the mattress over and over in desperation in my brothers bedroom and I feel something start to happen!  My left shoulder feels like it's being sliced open.  It wasn't painful but I definitely felt something going on.  The slice goes deeper and deeper until its half way down my torso.  Then I feel something slither into the gash.  It feels like an octopus or something.  It squishes and squashes further and further into my torso until I feel it fully get inside me... \n\nI think I have too many things to tell and I don't want to make this too long.  Maybe that's a mistake but I want to know if anyone is willing to listen to my story from here....  I'm scared but I feel like it's finally time to get this out there.  I don't think I can tell anyone in person these things.",

I looked around and I found the envelope lying on my bed, I knew I had left it on the counter, anyways I opened the letter and left it on my dresser but when I got to the kitchen, the letter was there, sealed, intact like it was there all along. This has happened with my keys too, I'll leave them on my kitchen table and then I'll find them hanging in a hook, or things in my room will be so subtlety changed that it's almost easy to miss, i lock my room when I leave for work, because I have a puppy who likes to make messes.

        "text": "&gt; So I have only found out about the whole Mandela Effect yesterday. And got absolutely sucked into it after a while. I am a massive Bond fan and I run a James Bond YouTube channel. Yesterday I received a seemingly innocent comment on my Moonraker Review video of someone asking me if I have memories of Dolly having braces. I can't say for certain anymore that I have, but I do always expect her to have them when the scene comes on, since it just seems so much more appropriate for the scene. He pointed me into the direction of the Mandella Effect and once I started reading, I got taken away by it. This one was alright, but the kidney and VW logo one really flabbergasted me! I was astounded with this unexplainable expierence!\n\n&gt;I started reading through the countless Dolly's braces sub reddit and was amazed by the passion behind these hundreds of fans who all share the vivid memory of her having braces. I've seen a lot of proof to back this up so far. (Discussions on old forums of fans discussing her braces, discriptions of her having braces with a picture next it which no longer show that, etc.)\n\n&gt; It got me wondering, the one thing I haven't seen anyone mention so far is the novelization that was made from this movie. (Not the original Moonraker by Ian Fleming written in 1955, but the Christopher Wood one.) I don't happen to own that particular book and I was curious if someone has it and can check how Dolly is discribed in the novelization. Does she have braces there or not?\n\n\n\n\n\nAll my posts to r/MandelaEffect are censored/secretly shadowbanned so I'm mirroring u/DutchBondFan 's post in this sub so others can read my reply.",

I can only wonder how many of my comments have been censored.\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've had at least one \"unusual\" TV broadcast experience. I was maybe 6 years old when my Sesame St. episode cut to scene where a guy was laying on a metal table and being dismembered by another guy. The guy being chopped up was still alive and was just all \"matter of fact\" about the whole ordeal. Also there was no blood coming from the victim. Like the OP's experience it lasted about 20 seconds.\n\nLooking back I figured it must have been some kind of MK ultra/psyop type deal as these psychopaths like to target children.\n\nI might theorize that the technique they use is some kind of brainwave entrainment where the subject is instantly put into a waking dream with a psychotronic TV &amp; programing. The subject would awake after a short period and never know that they had been in an altered state/dreaming.\n\nThis would explain the OP's missing time.\"\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nSource: https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/54vn54/i_think_i_watched_a_football_or_some_kind_of_game/d85cx8z",

        "text": "Anyone ever had experiences which make no sense whilst under the influence of psychedelics? Either with others or alone? I'm not talking at the peak of a trip while experiencing ego death or anything like that.. But more when you think you're pretty grounded and just the most absurd things happen? \n\nLittle info about me before I share a few instances. Fairly switched on. Have a couple degrees. Very in control when under the influence, don't have any 'woah pink elephants mannnnn'  type trips. Don't really trip anymore, so not a huge psychedelic warrior. \n\nFew examples of what in taking about.. \n\n1. Lsd - Had probably the most important/intense experience of my psychedelic life with my best friend. About ten hours after we were kind of debriefing, eating some food and hanging out. Put on an album on my cd player (which had a clock), was an album which wasn't great but wasn't bad. We'd not listened to it before and a fair bit of the lyrical content of some songs could be connected with the same type of thoughts one might have while tripping.. Because it was new to us and we were in the realm of 'I'm not going to be sleeping for at least a few more hours' we listened to the album three times (to lazy to change the cd and we were enjoying it anyways). Clock went from 1:45am putting in the cd and checking the time  to 1:58am and had listened to at least an hour and half plus of music.. Made no sense. Can promise that we were both in a clear enough mind not to have made an error in time keeping (the same Letterman ep was still on in the background and not even close to finishing on the TV. \n\n2. Lsd -  this one's also connected to the first in a way. On that last trip we were living in an apartment which had a regular garden / maintenance dude. He was of African decent and a really nice guy. He was gardening out the front of the apartment complex roughly half way into the trip when we decided to go for a walk to the park which was directly across the road. He said he, we said hi, nothing special. About five years later and living very very far from the old apartments me and my friend tripped together for the first time in years. Went for a walk to our new local park (roughly 500m from our new house) and at the house right across from itwas the gardener, no chance it was anyone else. He locked eyes with us, no one said hi (we were both just shocked to see him). This one can be totally attributed to coincidental and I'm fine with that, it's just that this kind of stuff will most generally happen when under the influence. \n\n3. Dmt - this one was with a different friend. Always interested in communicating with the beings you see on this stuff. So what we decided to do was have separate rooms with a pen and paper each. We were to chat to the beings and ask for a number between 1-60 (not really sure why we made 60 the limit). \n\nAnyways both of us went and tripped, both forgot to talk to the beings about the numbers (was too intense haha),  anyways what happened was I sobered up a little before going into the other room, saw the paper and was like 'oh yeahhh that stupid number thing we were doing. Blah seems so unimportant now but I'l write down a number,. Hmm I'm feeling the number 16'. So I wrote that down and then before going out of the room I felt this feeling in my head 'oh wait.. I'm feeling the number 8 now,but argh this wasn't my first choice.. Il just write a little number 8 under the 16'. So yeah I did that and it kind of looked like a 16 to the power of 8, but the little 8 was at the bottom of the sixteen as opposed to the top if it was really going to be a 'to the power of'.\n\n So then I  walked out grabbed a glass of water in the kitchen and walked into the other room. Chatted about the trip with my mate for a good ten mins (the number thing was of little importance at this stage as I forgot to ask the beings for a number). Got to the point in convo where my mate admitted he forgot as well but still wrote something on the paper. Showed me his copy before I showed him mine. Nearly could not speak.. He had a big 16 with a little 8 under it. Was pretty much the day I gave up on thinking I'd ever understand the world we live in haha. \n\n4. Mushrooms - Me and my two mates from the other stories plus another dude were walking to the park around midnight. Fairly feeling the effects. Was a quiet night and usually in these scenarios we try to keep quiet and calm (half cos we are tripping and don't wanna highlight what were doing and half to keep other people on the streets feeling easy -  three of us are 6 foot plus and seeing us in weird clothes trawling the burbs at midnight can probably intimidate other). We got to the park where my friend lit up a cigarette and then we all heard the most cutesy, fairly like voice which said 'will you be my friendddd?' There was absolutely no one around. We triple checked the whole Park. It didn't make sense.. \n\nAnyway this is just a small handful of these scenarios which have happened. Could list more but I should be working. Would love to hear if anyone else has had this kind of stuff happen to them. I'm very new to reddit so sorry if I'm not doing this right. \n\n\n",

For some reason, I just happened to remember the particular phrase very clearly.  A few days later when the episode aired on another network, a completely different joke/phrase took the place of the original one I had heard.  Fortunately, a friend watching it with me said that he had also watched the original airing, and confirmed that the dialogue had been altered.\n\nFor anyone that's had this experience, is this typical for TV shows and I was just unaware?  Maybe due to network policies or rating, etc.?",

        "text": "I have had several cases of Sleep paralysis over the years but none of them have been as weird as this one. \n\nThis was an early morning plane ride that I had yesterday, early morning because I had to wake up at 4:30 in the morning to get to the airport on time since its pretty far from where I was. The actual flight was at 8:10. \n\nI boarded the plane and kept on reading the book that I had. We took off and had probably climbed at around cloud level when I finished the chapter I was on and felt very very sleepy. So I kept the book down, plugged in the earphones, got a little comfortable, laid my head back and went to sleep. \n\nNow for some context on how sleep paralysis works for me....I usually get them when I sleep in weird curled positions or lay my head at weird angles. This by no means was weird...it was straight back and it wasn't even a bumpy ride that my head could have fallen on either side, something that usually starts it. \n\nEven then, the first thing I remember after sleeping is me losing control of my movement and my head falling on my right side right by the window, exactly where I was actually sitting. The usual signs prevailed, my breathing is a little heavy and fast, I am very anxious, my body is not moving and my tongue is twitching as I am trying hard to move my shoulders which seem to be the only things I can move. \n\nAfter about 3-4 minutes of trying, I am no closer to freedom when suddenly a bright light flashes right onto my face and I instinctively move my face away from it and wake up to reality. I start breathing normally and look to my right and decide to shut the window. The flight attendants have started serving food. Since I had no plans of ordering anything, I immediately decided to go back to sleep.\n\nThis time I get a little more comfortable and try to get a little cosy in the corner so as to have little space to move. I close my eyes and fall asleep again. \n\nAgain I am paralysed, this time my head falling to my left instead of my right. I have better control on my neck though, so I try to get stable by rocking my head slowly. I almost get it right except that my head upon reaching the centre then falls to the right, back in the same old position.\n\nThis time it went on for much longer and was much worse. So long that my mouth was dry and at some point I was drooling and sweating and was way more anxious. \n\nRight up until here it just seems like another bout of sleep paralysis. However it got weirder from here. So now I am just speculating of what might have happened.\n\nUsually after trying a lot to move from sleep paralysis, I sub consciously give in and try to go to sleep, a technique which has worked almost always before. So I did that, I closed my eyes and tried to calm myself and tried to sleep. \n\nThe next thing I remember is walking down the middle of the plane, like one would as they are de boarding it except that there was nobody else to be seen. I get a tap on my shoulder(not sure which one) and I turn around. \n\nRight at that moment I wake up from my sleep and turn to my left    to find one of the flight attendants asking me to raise the shutter as we are getting ready to land. \n\nFrom there it was all normal, until I realised that my neck had no ache at all. That is something that always happens to me when I have a case of sleep paralysis because my head was falling to a side, the neck pain from those are terrible and last for days. But I did not have any kind of pain at all. I only felt a little dodgy as I walked out and things were a little too white which felt weird but it all cleared in a couple of minutes. \n\nDefinitely my weirdest case of Sleep Paralysis. And just as fascinating. \n\ntl;dr Probably, Had a case of sleep paralysis in a dream, and then had a dream while paralysed. ",

        "text": "Aloha all, \n\nBack when I was living in New Jersey, I had a really super weird experience that I have only told a few people about because I figured nobody would believe me anyway and I would end up sounding more weird than I am already.\n\nAnyway, I was watching my aunts house and dog with some friends while her, my uncle and cousins were on vacation. The house is a little older but nothing too spooky or strange, just a few weird design things like oddly low ceilings in some rooms. One night we were drinking (underage so some disgusting ginger ale and flavored vodka drank) but we had just started and nobody was at all intoxicated yet. My friends and I go to head down the steps when my one friend goes barreling down the stairs and her drink falls all over her. It was actually comical but she insisted she had been pushed. Nobody was behind her as we were over the railing watching her head down the steps. Ok... Weird... But still not THAT weird. The house did start to make me wonder however. \n\nIt wasn't until the next day that the true weirdness struck. My boyfriend was over and wearing a flannel shirt. He had cigarettes in his front pocket. I asked him for a cigarette and headed outside. While I don't remember smoking the cigarette or much after asking for it to be honest, I did remember those stupid fucking cigarettes damn well existed in his front pocket that morning! \n\nBut when I asked him for another smoke a couple hours later, he insisted he had never had any cigarettes the whole day. I told him, duh, he had earlier I asked him for one! But he insisted he did not. Come to think of it, he wasn't even wearing a flannel fucking shirt anymore! I know what I saw and I know for a fact I was wide awake when all of this happened. The weird part was the gap after the cigarette that I cannot remember at all. It was like cigarette &gt; gap time period &gt; magically on couch with boyfriend. But I didn't even realize this gap until after confronting him about the cigarette. Wtf!? This was NOT a dream! Then what the fuck? To this day I have not been able to rationalize this \"glitch\". Haunted house fucking with me or matrix glitch?? Probably never know. ",

I did not grab it for some odd reason, I decided to go upstairs and yell at my mom to come down and see what I found. After I got her down there it was gone... I still believed in Santa at the time so i believed that maybe he was just stashing them in our basement and he didn't want me to see them. I did not want coal so I didn't check. Looking back on it, it seems like it would have been my parents mistake but the weird thing is. I did not get it for Christmas and never, and this is on of the clearest memories I have from that time in my life. I have no idea what happened. And the rest of my family does not believe it.

The machine started to spit out coins like there was no tomorrow. Slowly people all around the bar started to gather around me, making jokes about my \"beginner's luck\". That day I went home with my beach blanket full of coins.\n\nThe next day I went for a second, blind run, and the same thing happened again. The usual visitors of the bar got really impressed and I became their mascotte, many of them gave me their cash to play in their stead and I promptly got back to them with mountains of coins -they always let me keep a part of the prize-. I became sort of a legend among the usual customers of the bar, and during the following two years the same thing kept happening over and over, from 1996 to 1998.\n\nWe never came back since then, until I was 18 and decided to get back there on my own. Nobody seemed to recognize me after all that time, I didn't recognize any of the usual customers sitting in the bar either.
