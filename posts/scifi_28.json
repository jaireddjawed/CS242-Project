        "text": "I’m very fascinated by this trope/concept - The Expanse and Foundation come to mind immediately but I know there are other examples (just can’t recall the names…) - because I’ve often thought that technology will outstrip (and maybe already has) our ability to process information coherently. \n\nIs it a fallacy of anthropocentric writing that we consider ways that humans will fly spaceships/lucidly travel through large jumps in spacetime? Would it be necessary  for the brain to be altered in order to do so? \n\nI would love to hear your thoughts.",

At some point she accidentally gets bonded to an alien parasite. I think it was a series with at least 3 books. I think the parasite embedded itself in her wrist, and it learns to talk to her through telepathy. The later 2 books allow her to have powers to fight the enemies of her new friends. The parasite may have been named Remy or Remi. It also implies the existence of ghosts.  It was published somewhere between 2000-2014.\n\nThis is not Amulet, it was a novel.

The creatures are very formidable physically:  extremely thick, tough, armored exoskeleton; very powerful claws; frightfully sharp teeth; and superlative hearing.  However, Species 8472 is no pushover, either:  they can survive the cold vacuum of space; they can poison their enemies through venomous cells delivered by their claws; they have extremely robust immune systems.  Species 8472’s most distinct advantage, though, would have to be their minds.  They have vastly superior intelligence to the creatures, who seem to be just beasts, so Species 8472 wins in a battle of cunning, wits, and strategy.  Also, they are extremely powerful telepaths.  I wouldn’t be surprised if Species 8472 could mind control the creatures and make them jump into a lake, where they would drown.  Alternatively, Species 8472 could probably mess with their minds and make them believe that they weren’t actually hearing anything.  Even if one Species 8472 was surrounded by several creatures, it could probably make them all turn on each other.  The creatures might be more ferocious physically, but in this battle, brains would beat brawn.",

        "text": "Back during that time it seemed like people thought that the only people who enjoyed medieval fantasy themed shows and \"Battlestar Galactica\" were \"People who live in basements\".\n\nI was never into anything space or sci fi until I got tired of playing games like CoD before the start of my first year of college in 2013. During the Summer of 2013 before my first year of college I picked up a cheap copy of \"Mass Effect\" from a local GameStop after remembering hearing a good friend rave about it and what I experienced blew me away. It was unlike any game I had played before. It was like directing a movie but it was also like an interactive novel.\n\nIt gave me a sense of wonder of what might be out there in the universe and made me wish humanity would stop fighting.\n\nFor some strange reason I associate sci fi with lasers, FTL starships, flying cars, and a wide range of aliens with the optimism of the 1990s. During that same time one of the stations on my family's TV was playing \"The Fifth Element\". This was the first time I ever watched that movie and I ended up falling in love with it.\n\nAfter finishing Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 I discovered the ME series was inspired by \"Battlestar Galactica\", \"Firefly\", and \"Babylon 5\". I ended up binge watching those.\n\nI also found out about \"The Expanse\" novels and devouring them.\n\nI also discovered the indie game \"To The Moon\" which got me into a different type of sci fi.\n\nDuring college I became too busy to enjoy most of that stuff. I heard about what happened with \"Andromeda\". I became more interested in \"Greek Life\" and vacations to Disney World.\n\nWhy was there a stigma in the first place? Why was society more conformist regarding that type of stuff?\n\nI remember back in middle school when I first heard of the Mass Effect sex controversy with Fox News. I was an avid reader of \"GamePolitics\" and liked to laugh at Jack Thompson's antics.\n\nI disregarded Mass Effect as childish when I first saw the game cover and I did until I got bored of CoD.\n\nI didn't realize I was missing something so good.\n\nWhere does that cultural mindset come from?",

The deterministic universe and its implications on human agency and free will, the ethical questions about the nature of time, casuality and role of technology in shaping our lives.\n\nWhat I love about it and most of the Garland's work is how they're filmed and contrasted with nature as if nature was swallowing humanity or just humanity encroaching on nature, the greenery is ever present. There's a lot to love about Devs and it certainly deserved a lot more popularity than it got... At least that's my opinion.",

My prime examples are Dune, Heavy Metal, Nausica, Star Wars (to some extent), Alien or 40k. \n\nMy rules are a bit watery but: \n\nFirst: It needs to be detached from our real world, so no „realistic“ near future elements like Elysium, Avatar or Expanse. \nOn the other hand, Blade Runner seems detached enough for me because its clearly another universe to ours, despite the links to real things. \n\nSecond: Style over Substance. Practical, authentic Scifi Tech is cool but in this Genre Stuff first has to look otherworldly and stylish\n\nThird: Magical Aspects. The Force, the Warp, Spice, you name it there has to be some kind of magical element to the verse. \n\nFourth: This one is quite specific, but I feel like this Kind of Art has to have some kind of Psychedelic 70s/ 80s Charm to it. \n\nThe only name I have for this genre is Esoteric Scifi but that doesnt really fit either. But I‘m also not talking about high concept or existential Scifi\nDoes anyone have recommendations?",
