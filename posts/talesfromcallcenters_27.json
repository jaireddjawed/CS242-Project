        "text": "This happened a few years ago. Standard on mobile, sorry about format. I worked in a call center for 4 years; we handled catering and take-out orders for various companies. This was a catering call in NYC (I live in CO).\n\n\nThe call started normally with the guest providing basic info, including delivery address and a date that was about a month in the future. Very common so I proceed with gathering her menu as I entered her information. Our platform for this concept was really buggy and sometimes the closest location wouldn't autopopulate. I tried my usual tricks to make it work (while the guest continued talking about her event). Nothing worked so as she finished giving me all the details, I asked to place her on hold so I could verify the closest location.\n\n\nSometimes, this issue would happen when it was a particularly busy day for the restaurant and they were already booked up. Considering the advanced notice, I was 99% sure that wasn't the case, but I called them just to make sure. The restaurant was not booked so I went back to the guest to tell her that the restaurant could accommodate the order but I was having technical issues getting into my system. I asked to call her back \"within 15 minutes to check in.\"\n\n\nSo I disconnect with her and call my IT dept and they haven't received any error reports on the platform. At this point, I'm running out of ideas to get the issue resolved because nothing makes sense. It'd been buggy before, but there was always a reason, a fix. My next step was to call the NYC regional manager and that's when I heard the line I'll never understand, \"I can't tell you why, but we can't help you.\" I asked what I should tell the guest and he said, \"I don't know; you should talk to your boss.\"\n\n\nColor me confused. I called the guest back to inform her I was still working on the issue (at this point, I honestly thought the RM was misinformed) and told her I'd call her again within an hour. So I called my immediate supervisor (I was a home based agent at the time) and he was confused as well. We contacted the Brand Manager and she had no answers for us. We settled on the idea that I should give the order manually to the restaurant and they could handle payment (This is the only time I was ever told to do this; very against our FCR policy).\n\n\nSo I called the guest again, verified all the details, and told her she'd get a call from the restaurant that day to finalize the order. I called the restaurant and gave the info. Issue resolved, or so I thought. As I disconnected, I got a call on my cell phone (very odd), but I answered and it was the manager of the Brand Managers, Larry, someone I had only seen in passing and we did not know each other. \n\nLarry: \"Hi &lt;agent&gt;, I've heard from the regional manager in NYC that you've been asking questions. How can I help you?\"\n\nMe: Briefed him on the issue and stated I was told to do a manual order.\n\nLarry: \"Oh I see, they shouldn't have told you that.\" (Long pause) \"Okay, here's the deal. We're closing the restaurants in that area but no one knows about it and you can't tell them.\"\n\nMe: \"&lt;specific location&gt; is closing? I just spoke with them and they stated they could accommodate the order.\"\n\nLarry: \"They don't know yet. The locations are closing next week and corporate doesn't want anyone to know. You need to inform the guest and restaurant that we can't do the order.\n\n\nSeems simple right? Just call them and say we can't do it. But then they're going to ask WHY. Larry has no idea how I should inform them, kinda chuckles and says, \"good luck.\" Wtf? Now what?\n\n\nThe restaurant was easy; just told them the guest changed their mind. No sweat off their back. The guest, however, didn't understand and wanted a reason. I should mention that she had been very nice and patient while I worked through the issues. She had even apologised in our last conversation for \"all the frustration\" and \"I'm sure you have better things to do.\"\n\n\nGuest: \"Why can't they do the order?\"\n\nMe: I'm not certain but I was informed they couldn't accomodate.\"\n\nGuest: \"Okay, what about &lt;another location in NYC&gt;?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm sorry, ma'am, but no locations in your area are able to handle this order.\"\n\nGuest (getting confused and rightfully frustrated): \"Why not? Are they too busy?\"\n\nMe: (stupidly says no and repeats that we aren't able to accommodate the order)\n\n\nThis continues for a couple minutes until I'm sick of lying to her (I'm a guest-oriented rep and I always want to help in any way possible). I tell her that the restaurants in the area were closing but that it wasn't announced yet and that's why it took so long to figure out. She accepted this, although was annoyed that her time was wasted. I agreed and apologized profusely.\n\nAll in all, it took slightly more than two hours to get the problem resolved. That's when I learned never to state that we can accommodate a request until I was 100% certain.  Hard lesson and I still feel bad for that lady who got the run-around for two freaking hours!",

I have my ways. So we can still search for it other ways...other...longer...more time consuming ways. Like calling our help desk and having them pull up archives from the year before on a hd that's filled to the max and takes like 10 minutes to log into. And they have the nerve to be annoyed when you come back over to finally get to work on the reservation. Lol. \n\n\n&gt; oh never mind I'll just call back\n\n\nThen they hang up.

        "text": "Cancelling a flight sucks. For everyone. Delaying a flight sucks. For everyone. But safety is the upmost priority and unfortunately you have those calls where you tell people flying on their original schedule just isn't an option. Frustration is understandable, even a slight outburst but...complete unwillingness to respond...\n\n\nSo I just had to tell a guy his flight was cancelled (he lives in the middle of nowhere that has one flight a day and since he's not willing to drive 10 miles to the nearest airport), I have no options for him for the next 24 hours....he stops responding\n\n\"Hello sir...hello...I will be disconnecting the call due to no response in 30 seconds\"\n\n&gt; I'm here\n\n\"I apologize about the circumstances sir. We have nothing. Perhaps standby for the last flight of the night will open something up last minute\"\n\n&gt; . . . .\n\n\"Hello? Sir are you there? Hello...sir can you hear me?....disconnecting call in 30 seconds\"\n\n&gt; no I'm here.

Sir? Hello\"\n\n\nSo he does this two more times and I'm pretty much hip to his game now. So I stop speaking as well. He allows this to go on for 4 minutes. And I hatch a plan: I remembered that I wrote the authorization codes for the airport ticket counter direct lines in my notebook....and I found it.\n\n\nI called over to the ticket counter, told the gate agent to get the guy's attention and to have him either decide to rebook with her RIGHT NOW, or take the rental car and request a refund when he gets home\"\n\nLet's see him completely ignore and be passive to someone standing in his face. \n\n**takes a bow** \n\n\nMy pettiness and resourcefulness knows no bounds\n\n",

        "text": "I work at a mid-sized Fortune 500 life insurance company. We sell Universal Life policies. For those not familiar with life insurance, this is a policy that works similar to a bank account, with the monthly premium being deducted at the same time each month. The cost of this policy increases as the insured person ages. Some agents don't accurately explain how this works but it is all detailed in the policy paper work which is signed for by the owner. We get lots of escalated calls on these because if you don't have a moderate level of involvement with them, they easily fall behind. This particular call was one for the books. \n\nMe: Thank you for calling [company name]. My name is Kevin, how can I help you?\n\nCaller: Why is my policy behind?! I pay every month!\n\nMe: (checks current premium cost and compares it to what she's paying. She's been paying $40/month since 1985. Her premium is now $200/month. I explain this to her and explain how the policy works.)\n\nCaller: Well I was never told that!\n\nMe: I apologize if it wasn't explained accurately but this is outlined in your contract which you signed for. \n\nCaller: Well that's not right!\n\nMe: How is it not right?\n\nCaller: Because I don't want to pay that!\n\nMe: Well the good news is this is a flexible policy. You can decrease the coverage amount and it will in turn lower your premium. \n\nCaller: I don't wanna change anything!!! Leave it as it is!!\n\nMe: Then you will need to increase your payments. \n\nCaller: I'm not paying you anymore!!\n\nMe: Ma'am if you don't make one of those two changes you will lose your policy in 30 days. \n\nShe eventually threatened lawsuit and so on (this is quite common). She was in her 80s and sounded confused in general so I just kind of had to let her rant about it. Moral of the story: if you are signing up for something, REGARDLESS of what the sales person says to you, read and research throughly. They may (or may not) be deceiving you to make a quick sale. Not to say all of our sales people are deceitful but it's an important life lesson most people don't consider ",

        "text": "Hello everyone! \n\nIn terms of tech support I work more on the immediate front line. I am in a retail environment but work at a designated warranty centre so it is my duty to help with a lot of issues in regards to cell phones, from bad firmware to bent sim pins and water damage. \n\nA customer that had purchased his phone from our location stopped in, came up to me and informed me he was having issues installing apps and using his phone. Upon some basic digging in his settings it became apparent that he was an avid photographer. 75% of his phone was full of photos! \n\nWorry not, I thought, his phone was equiped with an expandable slot for an SD card. After giving him some options he decided on a 64Gb card for his phone. I had already bagged the product and was handing it to him when he told me he would need help doing it.\n\nOh.\n\nBecause it was slow I could take the time and couldn't really think of a reason to say no. I take the SD card out and put it into the phone, and proceeded into the file explorer of the LG G4. \n\nDown past the misc. file, through the DCIM, I arrived at images. I prefaced clicking on the file by asking the customer, \"Is it okay for me to go into here?\" \n\nWithout hesitation he assured me it was. \n\nOpening the file.... \n\nNUDES, NUDES EVERYWHERE, Pictures of (Presumably) his wife doing all sorts of horrible things. \n\nI have never seen a 50+ year old man look so embarrassed in his life. I politely locked his phone, handed it back to him saying, \"I think you got the idea...\" \n\nHe thanked me and left. \n\nTLDR; Full phone, needed help, turns out it wasn't the only thing full. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nEDIT: I just realized I posted in call centers and not tech support. Thank you guys for not tearing me a new one over the mistake. You people are awesome. ",

        "text": "I got a call a while back from a guy who was pissed that his bill was so high. OK, no problem, I went over his bill and explained the charges. There might have even been an error that I fixed. That wasn't the real issue. The *real* issue was that his bill was double what it should be, because he had a balance carried from last month.\n\n\nI spent a good half hour minimum explaining to this guy that he had been carrying a balance for *three years*. He missed a payment one month three years prior and never got caught up. He argued that this was ridiculous because he paid his bill every month, which he did, except for that month when he didn't. Somehow this is our fault because he couldn't be arsed to check his bill for a few years. (never mind that by finding out his current balance due by any other method he would have known there was a past due amount... He had some explanation for that but I don't remember what it was.) He said he always paid by check. I told him that we could easily fix the issue, but I needed the check number, amount and date, and he refused before I could get any farther. After explaining again what happened and stating that I can fix the problem only to have him cut me off again, I returned to the tactic I use for stubborn and petulant people who can't grasp that the answer isn't going to change: I repeated the same phrase. \"I can get this fixed and get the missing payment applied, but I need some information in order to do that.\" \n\n\nPeople will usually give up after 5 or 6 repetitions and accept the situation, but he wouldn't. I switched  to another tactic and asked him directly what he was looking to have happen. I knew what he was going to say, and he didn't disappoint - he wanted me to credit back almost $300. My answer was a very tactful and polite version of hell no. It's not our fault that you either a. Didn't pay the bill or b. Never checked your bill (bullshit) to verify that your account is current. I also knew for a fact that this was not something my boss would agree to so I didn't bother to check and he never asked to speak to a manager. Guy said he'd cancel, and my response was \"I'm sorry to hear that\" with another assurance that we can in fact fix the problem. \n\n\nPeople really hate it when I call them out on crap like this. He hadn't paid his bill and knew we would find that out. Just like the guy who claimed he had a lawyer and I told him the best thing to do would be to contact his lawyer for a subpoena to get the information he wanted....he got so pissed, he clearly didn't have a lawyer. It's ridiculous. ",

        "text": "So I make appointments for people to claim welfare. One of the rules of the new welfare system is that it has to be paid into an account in your own name. This is in the actual legislation that introduced the benefit. We do assessment questions before we book the appointment to make sure that people can claim, then this happened -\n\n*Me: Do you have a bank account in your own name?*\n\n*18 year old kid: No, it's in my dad's name.*\n\n*Me: The account is in your dad's name? And you have no other accounts?*\n\n*Kid: No.*\n\n*Me: Sorry, but to claim this benefit you must have an account on your own name. You can go to the government website to find other benefits you may be entitled to (which pay exactly the same, just aren't on the shiny new system).*\n\nAt this point I'm set, I clarified, the answer was unequivocal. Unfortunately the kid's mummy was in the background, and so she dives on the call.\n\n*Mummy: Why can't my son claim benefits?*\n\n*Me: He may be able to claim benefits, just not this one, as he doesn't have a bank account in his own name?*\n\n*Mummy: This is outrageous, who do I speak to about this?*\n\n*Me: This is outlined in legislation that has gone through Parliament, you should see your MP.*\n\n*Mummy: Don't be ridiculous.*\n\n*Me: ... (I mean what the fuck, is she suggesting somebody at my office has the authority to override the law?)*\n\nSo we go around in circles, with me explaining why he's not eligible, and her whining, until we get to the point that I can use our wrap up script in these circumstances:\n\n*Me: I'm afraid I've given you all the information I can, if you have no other queries I will have to terminate the call.*\n\nAnd then she does it, she says the magic words.\n\n*Mummy: I'd like to speak to a manager.*\n\nSo I got a manager. And in the most shameful, pitiful display of cowardice, the manager, rather than sticking up for me and telling her what I'd told her, started talking with her. And talking. And talking. At this point between my manager and myself we'd been talking to this woman for over ten minutes, with no new information being exchanged since I'd told the kid he wasn't eligible. Just as it looks like the call is going to end, the mother pipes up with this beauty.\n\n*Mummy: Oh... you know... he might have a bank account... yes I think he does.*\n\nRather than recoiling at the stench of the bullshit that this lady had just shovelled upon her, the manager accepts this at face value. Never mind that this lady and her son had not been able to think of this account for nearly 15 minutes. Never mind the amazing coincidence that caused her to recall this just as she was about to be cut off. Nah. So she put me back on the call with the kid.\n\nFurther into the call we have to get the claimant to take in evidence to the benefit centre. Standard stuff, passport, ID and the like. They also have to take proof of address, in the form of a bank statement or utility bill. Because the kid lives with mummy of course no utilities were in his name, so I tell him to get a bank statement.\n\n*Kid: I don't have a bank statement.*\n\n*Me: That's okay, you can go into your local bank branch and get them to print one there.*\n\n*Kid: I can't do that.*\n\n*Me: Who's your account with?*\n\n*Kid: &lt;Major high street bank&gt;.*\n\n*Me: And do they have a store in &lt;town where kid will have to go to the benefit office&gt;.*\n\n*Kid: Yes.*\n\n*Me: Okay, so pop along before your appointment please and ask for a statement.*\n\n*Kid: It's not that kind of bank account.*\n\nIt's not that kind of bank account. It's not that kind of bank account that will tell you how much money you have in it.\n\nAt this point I gave in and just went ahead and booked the appointment. The kid probably turned up with his imaginary bank account and was likely told to fuck off. Hopefully mummy took him along.",

I actually posted this back when it happened in TFTS, but I figure it's good enough to retell here, and also I can clean up my writing from last time (was at work shortly after it all went down the first time..).\n\n\nMy previous role was a level 2 CSR in a fairly big Australian ISP. Between a group of us \"trusted\" reps, we used to share duties on a common email inbox. Being that we had offshore support, and overnight coverage, this inbox was mainly used by offshore reps who took a call from a customer related directly to our skillset. Basically the company bought out a small regional ISP a few years ago, and due to the complexity of said ISP's provisioning, billing and support tools the offshore people generally had no idea how to deal with these calls. In result, they'd email sharedinbox@domain.com and one of us would deal with it.\n\n\nAnywho. Part of this small ISP's network footprint was organisations in our nation's capital (and for the Aussie techs playing at home - you now know which company I'm referring to). Lots of private entities and government agencies.\n\n\nThe structure for these larger corporate and government accounts was, they had specific reps assigned to them as account managers. Effectively, these guys were used car salesmen - lying, cheating, lazy bastards. They kissed client's arses and dumped any hard work down to us.\n\n\nFor whatever reason, a new rep had taken over a portfolio of clients and as such, was using the previous rep's company-provided iPhone, complete with the same SIM card and number. He emails the inbox saying basically, deal with this guy please. Name and number, nothing else.\n\n\nI email the guy and ask, can you give us any more info for this? He replies with, and I quote \"no idea mate, I just took over this role and got the previous manager's phone, and this guy called the number so I got him to email me.\"\n\n\nKnowing what to expect from these \"me first\" customers, I get a good friend of mine who works specifically in business support to give this guy a buzz. The customer rants at this poor kid for 45 minutes about how much money he is losing due to the takeover by my company (which happened a few years back, not recently as these bills reflect).\n\n\nThis rep then emails another colleague of ours who deals more closely with these billing queries, who then discovers said client is still on the legacy billing system, which is why we couldn't find him on our main systems. The rep then emails us both back stating this client needs to speak with their account manager.\n\n\nHave a guess who the account manager was.\n\n\nFootnote: the client deleted one of their own products in the legacy client management system (an unused fax line from memory), which caused their bundle discounts to deactivate.",

And if the stars are not aligned in your favor when you go to rebook it may be sold out or more expensive.\n\n\nSo of course I get a lady (always a lady right) who wants to know why we cancelled out her flight \"without honoring the hold she placed on it\"\n\n&gt; me- it appears that you have several reservations all leaving out of Miami at the same time, our system in that case would actually cancel out those flights\n\n&gt; her- I WASNT SURE WHERE I WANTED TO GO FOR VACATION AND YOU JUST CANCEL ME OUT?\n\n&gt; me- I'm afraid so\n\n&gt; her- UNCANCEL ME!

        "text": "New to Reddit;\n\nWhile working for a call centre about a year ago in mid summer roughly, I ran into the weirdest floor chat I had ever read. Before I get into it just some explanation, we had a huge messenger for the entire centre so every employee can group chat  to ask questions, get help, or just to read updates ect. I found it pretty handy for those instant answers when under pressure. \n\nAnyway,\n\nIt was 11:00 pm, and I ended my shift in 30 minutes so I wasn't doing much. The call volume was quite dead at this time as well so I didn't have much to do but read through the floor chat/group chat. I noticed a frantic message stick out of the usual questions or messages, something along the lines of; \n\n\"I just got out of training im not prepared for this!! HELP.\" \n\nInstantly I watched the messages flow in from fellow employees probing the advisor for more information to try and help. Then they elaborated; \n\n\"I think someone got shot over the phone, I'm freaking out I don't know what to do, someone help there's so much screaming.\" \n\nNo more casual messages came through, the chat went dead for a good 10 seconds then just got spammed with all these employees freaking out and trying to asesss the situation. The advisor continued to express how they could not finish the call themselves, that they could not calm the customer down, and that they were not comforatable contacting the police. I was just shocked sitting there reading it, because I was fairly new at the time as well and I wasn't prepared to deal with something like that either. \n\nI think I stayed maybe a good 10 minutes after my shift to see if there was ever a resolution. Although I noticed It was getting later and I was ready to just go home at that point so I don't know if, for one that it even happened. Two, what the advisor did or if someone had to take over the call. It's still a mystery for me to this day, but I always tell it when someone is going for a call centre job for shits and giggles.\n\nBut what I really wanna know is what the hell that person did to get (allegedly) shot, and what the advisor said to push that customers reaction. \n \n ",

        "text": "Hello all!\n\nI was going to post this in TFR, but thought it might be better suited here; let me know if that's wrong.\n\nAnyway, years ago I spent a (very brief) time as a telemarketer; it was the worst job I'd ever had. I lasted a full two weeks before getting let go (I wasn't persistent enough), and managed to break my wrist at the end of my first week (last day of training; stepped on the caster of an office chair of the carrel next to mine as I was getting up so my supervisor could complete a sale, fell backwards on my hands, and fractured a small bone in my wrist). Suffice it to say, I wasn't too broken up about leaving. Something on TFR reminded me of these tales, so I thought I'd share them. With the exception of the Spanish in the first tale (which is the extent of my abilities), the dialogue is more-or-less what transpired.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOur call centre was based in Canada, but we had contracts with both Canadian and American newspaper companies to do cold-calling for sales; these were companies that typically owned several large papers, but would want to improve sales of smaller, local papers in particular regions.\n\nAnyway, one day I'd just finished a block of calls to California. Many of these households were Spanish-speaking; I'd done a couple years of Spanish in high-school, but my abilities were seriously lacking, so I would just ask if they could speak Spanish. Anyway, most of my calls to California were unproductive, but my next block of calls was to Canada, so I assumed it would be better going. I was on autopilot at the time, and my second call in, I get this:\n&gt; **Girl**: \"Hola?\"\n\n&gt; **Me**: \"Hola! Yo no hablo espanol. Hablas anglais?\" *Hello! I don't speak Spanish. Do you speak English?*\n\n&gt; **Girl**: \"Uhh, what?\"\n\n&gt; **Me**: \"Oh I'm sorry, I thought you spoke Spanish. I'm calling from...\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnother time, I called a lady from the US and had convinced her to purchase a subscription for a local paper. I was just waiting for something to come through on my computer so I could finalize the sale, and innocuously asked how the weather was where she was at.\n&gt; **Me**: \"So how's the weather right now in $town?\"\n\n&gt; **Lady**: \"Why are you asking me what the weather is like? Can't you tell?\"\n\n&gt; **Me**: \"No ma'am, I'm not calling from $town, I'm calling from $Canadian-city.\"\n\n&gt; **Lady**: \"Wait, you're not from America?\"\n\n&gt; **Me**: \"No ma'am, I'm in Canada, but I'm calling on behalf of $American-newspaper.\"\n\n&gt; **Lady**: \"So the company is in Canada?\"\n\n&gt; **Me**: \"The call centre is in Canada, ma'am, but $Newspaper-company is American.\"\n\n&gt; **Lady**: \"I changed my mind, I don't want the newspaper any more! I don't want my money going to Canada!\" &lt;hangs up&gt;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOne other time, I apparently called a business line (the computer auto-dialled), and the lady that picked up was polite at first, until I told her what I was calling about; at that point, she flew off the handle and started screaming at me about calling her on her business phone, and how she was a manager and very important and I was keeping her from her job. I tried to apologize, but she just hung up on me. I sat there for a few seconds to process (it was the first time someone had screamed at me, but it couldn't've been more than 3 or 4 seconds), when all of a sudden she picks up the phone again (I think she hadn't actually disconnected the call, just muted it or something) and starts screaming at me again that I'm holding up the line and I need to hang up immediately. Needless to say, we didn't try her again.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe final one I remember was actually my most pleasant call; I was calling another province, and the guy on the other end of the phone was very excited when he picked up.\n&gt; **Guy**: &lt;picks up phone&gt; \"Hey, you're calling from $my-province, right?!\"\n\n&gt; **Me**: \"Yes I am, how are you today?\"\n\n&gt; **Guy**: \"I'm great! How's the weather there?\"\n\n&gt; **Me**: \"It's pretty good, how's it there?\"\n\n&gt; **Guy**: \"Good.\"\n\n&gt; **Me**: \"That's great. So I assume you know why I'm calling, correct?\"\n\n&gt; **Guy**: \"Yeah, you wanna sell me something, right?\"\n\n&gt; **Me**: \"Yes, I've never heard anyone so eager to talk to a telemarketer before. I'm calling from $company about $local-newspaper subscriptions. Are you interested in signing up for a year of $local-newspaper?\"\n\n&gt; **Guy**: \"No, I just wanted to talk to someone from $my-province.\"\n\n&gt; **Me**: \"Makes sense. Thanks for taking my call, enjoy your evening!\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNeedless to say, I didn't last very long with that kind of attitude.",

        "text": "So I work at a call center for a major alarm and home automation company. Normally technician visits are $49, it costs us $300 to send somebody out but we only make the customer pay $49 or even less if we want to apply our goodwill credit to it. However if there was an actual break in we send a tech for free come look over and test the whole system, both for peace of mind for the customer and for liability reasons for us. This was my second or third week on the floor and I get this call from what sounded like an 80 year old, she tells me she heard somebody in her house last night, one of her sensors tripped, but her alarm never went off and that she wants somebody out to check on her system. \n\nAt first I'm all for it but I do have to ask her some specifics so the tech knows what to do. As we get into the details things get interesting, I ask what sensor went off since I can't see anything out of the ordinary from her arming the system to go to bed and disarming it in the morning on her panel's history. She tells me she had called in to get another window sensor and the agent had told her (as is policy) that the sensor would be $60, she didn't like that and had just stacked a bunch of cans on the window and she heard some of them clanging. According to her they didn't steal anything but she did hear them talking. Apparently she thought they were reps from another company planning on taking over her system *(at midnight after breaking into her house!?)*, for reference this is an actual thing in the alarm industry but what happens is somebody from the other company will pretend to be one of our reps performing an unannounced service upgrade and install one of their panels then start billing the customer, it's called a slam, but they don't do it at night and certainly not after breaking into their house, the IVR makes reference to it so that's probably where she heard about it. She also informs me the police won't visit her or answer or calls anymore either. Keep in mind she's been incredibly short with me and super condescending through the whole call.\n\nAt this point I'm thinking this doesn't sound right, she also informs me that the last time she had a tech out he apparently said \"I know you!\" then turned around and left. This is usually against protocol so I go and dig into the work order history, she has had no less then 8 technicians out in the past few months alone all for Actual Events which are not billable, that's a little over $2400. I pull up the most recent 3 and all the notes from the techs read some variation of \"the customer has late stage dementia and has been hallucinating various break-ins, history says nothing, attempted to get in contact with customer's next of kin but unable to get response. Do not schedule future visits\" or \"Customer refused to let me in citing not knowing if I was really from the company, showed customer my badge and let them put badge number into tech verification hotline, customer still refused to let me in after verifying me, unable to complete WO.\" \n\nAt this point I realize what's going on, end up getting a supervisor on the phone and actually bother to follow up rather than just scheduling another pointless tech visit and make sure we get a note on the account about what's going on. Once we both have our tickets submitted supervisor tells me that if the customer still wants a tech visit to tell them we'd have to get a police report sent to us due to the number of events. I relay this to the customer and she just explodes in a ball of angry, tells me \"well if you don't want to do your job then I'll just cancel my system and get competitors system!\" and then hangs up before I can respond.",

They open up Chrome, search for Yahoo.  Click on Yahoo, search for Facebook.  Click on Facebook.  It's asking them to sign in.\n\nI remind the customer that they are able to browse fine, and suggest that maybe, they should try signing in, like it says on the screen.

        "text": "L\n\nSorry for the long post, but this belongs here. Enjoy!\n\nOkay so this was a few years ago so bare with me here. Also obligatory mobile formatting apology.\n\nSo, I used to work for a real estate agency scheduling appointments for other real estate agents to show our listings. Most of the time it wasn't bad, very very monotonous, but not bad. It was a very laid back, relaxed company which was nice as well. Some of these real estate agents though think that they own the whole industry. This is about one of those agents.\n\n   I'm sitting there minding my own business, taking calls and doing my job. I get an inbound coming through onto my line, let's call her LA, or lawless agent. M as usual, will be me. The call starts with her freaking out. Like she's making it sound like the sky is falling.\n\nM: Thanks for calling Generic and Generic Real Estate name Real Estate, this is Lego, how may I assist you today?\n\nLA: I NEED TO MAKE A COMPLAINT. I'M VERY UPSET AND IN A STATE OF SHOCK, AND MY CLIENTS ARE EXTREMELY DISPLEASED.\n\n(Oh really...?)\n\nM: Well I do apologize to hear that ma'am, what seems to be the issue? Does it have to do with one of our list--\n\nLA: YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT IT HAS TO DO WITH ONE OF YOUR LISTINGS. THE OWNER IN FACT, WE WALKED THROUGH THE DOOR AND HE HAD A SHOTGUN POINTED AT OUR FACES AND TOLD US TO SCRAM. \n\n(At this point I'm actually genuinely concerned, like, this doesn't happen often, and there has to be a legitimate reason...Right?)\n\nM: Oh...Wow...Well miss LA, would you mind if I put you on a brief hold and call the owner?\n\nLA: Yeah yeah fine whatever.\n\n(LA gives me address of listing, now the software that we use keeps track of every little detail of each appointment, calls are time stamped, and all calls are recorded. LA's name isn't listed on list of showings for the day, hmmm.)\n\nM: *calls owner* Hello sir, my name is Lego with Real Estate Co., I just received a call from an agent about you pointing a gun at her...?\n\nOwner: Yes hi sir, thanks for calling! I was gonna call you to talk to you about it, I just misplaced your number. I had just hopped out of the shower and was getting dressed when I heard someone pull up to my driveway and walk up my steps. They started messing with the lockbox, and well to be frank I hadn't heard anything from my agent, or your company about an appointment. So I grabbed my gun and waited. I apologize for any confusion or inconvenience.\n\n(Very polite, mild mannered gentleman. Definitely caught me off guard.)\n\nMe: Well sir, it looks like the agent didn't schedule the appointment. So technically, you were within your constitutional right to do that. There's no reason to apologize! I was just following up. We'll let you know of any further appointments!\n\n(Got back on the line with the WONDERFUL LA, who's still whining to her clients about the whole thing like she's the victim.)\n\nMe: Okay ma'am I'm back, I do thank you for waiting.\n\nLA: I'm calling the cops, this is SO STUPID. IN ALL OF MY YEARS WORKING IN REAL ESTATE I HAVE NEVER ETC. ETC.\n\n(As of now I have the cheesiest grin on my face while trying to stifle laughter)\n\nMe: Well ma'am you see, you are more than welcome to do that, however I don't believe you'd like the result. Due to you not contacting us about showing this property, we keep all calls/emails/texts on record, you have technically just committed a very serious crime by breaking and entering into this man's home.\n\nLA: Excuse me...?\n\nMe: Yes ma'am, you never scheduled an appointment. So if you were to call the police, they would come and first off, arrest you for breaking into someone's home. They would then revoke your real estate license, which due to the crime you have commited, you would not be able to renew.\n\n*Silence ensues while I wait for the woman to comprehend what she had just done*\n\nLA: (searching and stumbling over words at this point) we-I-uh, well, if we decide to show this we'll let you know. Thanks for your time. *Click* \n\nAfterwards I proceeded to call the homeowner and blacklist her from showing his house again, then called his agent and explained everything. The owner's agent was LIVID. He thanked me for going above and beyond what I needed to do, and said that he would \"take care of business.\" \n\nTl;dr Real Estate Agent broke into this dude's house while he was there, he pointed a gun at her, she threatened to call police, told agent of her crime and agent may or may not have at least gotten her license revoked.",

I really, really don't like the altright crowd though and as such, eventually, a customer was on the line, whose viewpoints angered me. How I knew them? His email address proclaimed them proudly. I checked the domain to see that it actually was as bad as I thought it was, saw a screed against immigration, which made me want a shower 2 sentences in, rolled my eyes and took the call over from L1.\n\nNow, my name sounds a bit like that of a semi-recently mass-immigrated minority, one which all rightwingers felt really negative about, but given that my family immigrated about 5 generations ago, you'd never hear this. Unless of course, I intentionally imitate that accent. So, I gave the customer the best, most friendly assistance I could, just, you know, with an imitated accent from that certain area. He didn't comment on this and fortunately that call was not QAed and even the customer was happy in the end.

A manager from Zimbabwe had told some stories about how to get service in Harare would require crossing a national border, but that was all I knew about arranging service in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe protagonists: Me: myself, UF: the customer (Uganda fan), L1: a random Level 1\n\nMe: Welcome to $company, my name is Ten, what's the issue?\n\nL1: A customer calls for an exception. She was out of the area where we offer service and her $contract expired before she could return. She is 3 days out of it. Can she get an exception?\n\nMe: We'll see, can you throw her over to me?\n\nL1: Sure, just catch her! Have a nice rest-of-the-shift!\n\nMe: You too!\n\nMe: Welcome to $company, this is Ms Ninetythree, I have heard you were abroad when your $device had $issue and now want service, but are 3 days out of your $contract?\n\nUF: Hello, Ten, yeah, the issue has been ongoing for 2 months but I have been in Uganda and so I could not get it serviced. Now, I know that I am out of the service, but I thought you could maybe make an exception, please.\n\nMe: \\*smiling about the polite customer\\* Ah, good to see you are back in Switzerland. I'm looking into this right now. Where have you been staying in Uganda?\n\nUF: In the capital, Kampala.\n\nMe: Okay, grand, let me see what I can do here! \\*checks internal site. Generally exceptions are okay if the next service location is over 100km away.\\* \\*site chooses that very moment to slow down to dialup speeds\\* One moment, please! \\*dead air filling noises happened, then, I just decide to gamble, as I cannot imagine getting service in Uganda when this can be hard in areas of 1st world countries.\\* I am going to set up an exception here. I will call you back when it's all set up, okay?\n\nUF: Sure!\n\nMe: Can you tell me your phone number?\n\nUF: Sure, it's +41 41 123 456.\n\nMe: Okay, I'll call you back in a few minutes!\n\nSo, I start to write the bureaucratic documents for an exception. Now, I just need the distance to the next place to get service. After threatening the site once again with IE 6.0, it loads. I gasp. 0.1km? Directly in the center of Kampala!? W... T... F...?! But... I had already promised the customer that she'd get an exception! Sheet-in-the-wind! I ended up writing a bogus justification instead. So, I call back the customer.\n\nMe: Hello Ms Ugandafan, here is what you need to know. \\*Explains how to get service in Switzerland\\* And by the way, I am sending you a link about how to get service in Uganda, for the next time you're there! \n\nUF: Thank you so much!\n\nMe: No problem, have a nice day!\n\nUF: You too!\n\nThe moral of the story: Kampala is neither Harare nor Gaborone. It is instead Kampala!",

        "text": "If this post sounds rambly and random, please trust me that it is 1000x better than what I had to endure on this fucked up call. Also keep in mind that I an very, very good at staying calm with angry people and I can usually calm them down and get them to cooperate. \n\nSo I had a call from a lady a while back who had three or four trouble tickets open for poor service. All of them came back as no trouble found, check the device. She refused to believe it was the phone. Mind you, just getting to this point in the convo took about 10 to 15 minutes because she would not shut the fuck up. She also kept bouncing from one topic to another. She didn't get a call back from someone, but couldn't seem to nail down when this happened or who was supposed to call her back.... First she made it sound like the network team was supposed to call her but then said she talked to them for some number of hours. The issue was audio problems and people had repeatedly tried to get her to mark her calls but she refused, saying she called us to tell it when it happened at that should be enough... That's not how it works, the network team does not care when you call us no matter what you say, lady. \n\n\nSo after a great deal of listening to her ramble I figured the best way to get rid of her was to escalate the ticket, (she did have the phone replaced, so this was a valid option) which is usually just a quick note to our liason. She insisted I read it back to her, which was a mistake for me to comply... She complained that there wasn't enough detail and I didn't say this or that... In reality I was telling the liason that she was uncooperative but I could not tell her that. I can type fast enough that I can type what someone is saying verbatim while they are saying it, so I told her to just tell me what you want to say (and I was just going to change it later anyway so again, I thought humoring her would get rid of her faster.) I read it back to her and she claims she didn't say what I put down, which is bullshit because of how fast I type - I put it down exactly.\n\n\nI finally reached a  point where I accepted this will be nothing but a fight and humoring her will not work because she's fucking nuts, so I told her flat out that I'm done taking dictation and I will submit the escalation as I need to. Of course, she exploded in a fireball of crazy. She also claimed she was a teacher and that my grammar sucked, (maybe it does when I don't care, but I'm not writing a term paper here, the liason doesn't care) she worked in customer service and I was horrible at my job (in reality I am one of the best and my metrics proved it) and a couple other industries that I can't remember, but it all sounded like bullshit to me. She said she wanted to talk to my manager. OK, no problem please hold. Keep in mind she has provided me with a bunch of conflicting information that I'm not going into here. At this point it's been about an hour and change. \n\n\nWe had customer escalation reps and Sup point of contacts who took escalations, so one of them got on the line. I was on a Y cord so I could hear everything. The lady immediately said she didn't ask for a supervisor and where was the other girl? More conflicting information! More rambling and complaining ensued, again I will spare you the boring details but suffice it to say she refused to cooperate with anything required to fix her problem and jumped around from one complaint to another so fast it was hard to keep track. After another hour and change of refusing to take dictation for a network escalation (she wanted a bunch of detail in there that frankly no one cares about and is unrelated to a network ticket) the escalations rep actually got permission to hang up on her.... Which just isn't done with us, ever. Only sups can do that and even then it's extremely rare. \n\n\nTl;dr: I had a customer that was either a bucket full of crazy or she had dementia or something, refused to cooperate and had unreasonable demands, and we hung up on her. \n\n\nYesterday was the last day for our center and I have to say, I really loved my job, but there are parts that I will NOT miss.

The previous banker tried to see if we can waive this for you, but unfortunately as per policies and procedures we do require to see your pay slips, just to note the income in your account.\n\n*We go around on circles where he is rephrase the same thing a couple of times and I am rephrasing the same thing I am saying a couple of times*\n\n&gt; CRM - I am a managing director of [company overseas] and I can't believe you are doing this to me over a 3k credit card for my daughter. \n\n*I am internally thinking why can't little princess apply for her own card?*\n\n&gt; Me - Sir I understand your frustration and where you're coming from. It is stringent, I agree, and I apologize. However, it is the way it is and we require the pay slips. But I can definitely put that feedback forward.\n\n&gt; CRM - Well if you agree why don't you do something about it! You say that this call might be recorded, then why don't you tell Mr recorder man that his policies need to be fixed!\n\n*Internally cringing because people that deal with policies are not the people that deal with calls and QA*\n\n&gt; Me - As I said sir, I can put that feedback forward so they can reassess this, but in the interim we do need the pay slips to move forward with the application.\n\n&gt; CRM - But I am the managing director, what - do you want to to do my own pay slips and give them to you! \n\n&gt; Me - well are you self employed or are you an employed managing director?\n\n&gt; CRM - I am a managing director.\n\n&gt; Me - yes I understand that, but you can be a managing director who is managing for someone else, or you can be a managing director who owns the company. Which one? \n\n*The reason I asked this was because if it was his own company, he would need to show us even more docs*\n\n&gt; CRM - well no, I own a few shares but I do not own the company. *you could feel him being sad as he said this*\n\n&gt; Me - OK then sir, you can ask the person you report to, to issue you with pay slips for the periods worked. We need to see if your tax has been paid here or abroad.\n\n&gt; CRM - you're not listening! You're not understanding me! They need to change the policies. Why don't you speak to someone more senior about this!\n\n*At this point I gathered that this idiot wanted me to go to a different building a few miles away, set up a meeting with these people and tell them they need to overhaul the policy just for this man, ALL THE WHILE HE WAS ON THE PHONE WITH ME*\n\n&gt; Me - Sir I am not going to proceed with this call. I have let you know what we need in order for the app to move forward. Thank you for speaking with [bank] and have a lovely day. \n\n*Click*",

        "text": "Greetings. I've had a varied career, but I spent some time a few years ago working for a hotel management company taking reservations.\n\nNow, this particular company wasn't very... fiscally solvent. While there were many clues, perhaps the most memorable was the time they decided to offer a Groupon for a two night stay at one of the hotels.\n\nI'm sure everyone knows Groupon as a consumer, but in business terms, they are basically just payday loans for struggling businesses. From that $99 hotel room you purchased, the hotel itself probably sees $50. The rest goes to Groupon, presumably to hire more writers to compose their humorous descriptions of the products and services offered. Businesses rarely survive when they only collect 50% of their targeted revenue during a promotion.\n\nNow, as a hotel call center rep, having an active Groupon is essentially giving the western hemisphere's stupidest demographic your phone number, and encouraging them to call you. This is where it gets bad.\n\nI'll play \"TCP\", the caller is, well, \"Caller\":\n\nTCP: Good afternoon, reservations line, how may I help today?\n\nCaller: Hey, how longs y'alls Groupon up fer?\n\nTCP: No problem, well ma'am, the Groupon purchasing window actually ends tonight at midnight.\n\nCaller: Yeah, how longs it take fer mah payment to go on mah card?\n\nTCP: I'm not quite sure, but I would suppose that Groupon would charge your card immediately, as the vouchers are valid as soon as you receive them. Did you have some dates in mind where you'd like to visit? (Groupon dates are restricted)\n\nCaller: No, ah mean how longs it take fer mah payment to go on mah card?\n\nTCP: I'm sorry ma'am, I honestly don't know. I'd just assume it would appear immediately. As I said, the Groupon vouchers are valid immediately, now, can I ... (cuts me off)\n\nCaller: No! Ah just paid mah credit card bill so that I can buy the groupon, but it won't let me! How longs it take?\n\nTCP: I'm sorry ma'am; are you asking how long it takes your bill payment to show up on your credit card statement? That would be something handled directly between you and your bank, I honestly have no idea. \n\nCaller: Well then can you hold the Groupon fer meh? Ah wanna go to the bank and ask, but they're closed. \n\nTCP: I'm sorry ma'am, I'm not able to do that. The Groupons have to be purchased in the next four hours. After that, the deal just isn't available.\n\nCaller: (sudden escalation) WELL THAT'S JUST GREAT. I GUESS YOU LOST A CUSTOMER. AHM NEVER BUYING A GROUPON AGAIN!\n\nTCP: That's ok ma'am, I don't work for Groupon, and it doesn't sound like you can afford it anyway.\n\nCaller: SCREEEEE (I disconnected at this point.)\n\nThe one positive of working for a failing hotel? They can't afford to record calls, let alone review them. 😉",

        "text": "Hello everyone!  \nFirst time poster, sry for any mistakes in advance, i do apologize for any wrong grammar. English is not my native language.  \nHope you will enjoy reading this!  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nI work in xTransportCompany for public transport. We only recommend and give information about our tickets, but mostly our annual tickets.  \nTo acquire an annual ticket you need to fill out an application form and hand it in first before anything else. On those application forms there are clear written paragraphs, ToS and other conditions from our company listed that you will agree upon ordering an annual ticket.  \nI will explain step by step in details about the conditions of our contract in the following conversation.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nThis happens once in a while or a few times in a year.  \nMe = yours truly  \nC = Customer  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nMe: \"This is im4niceperson what can i do for you?\"  \nC: \"I'm a customer and i have a annual ticket, you just deducted &lt;insertamount&gt; from my bank account!\"  \nMe: \"Alright, i'll look into it, do you have your customer number?\"  \nC: \"&lt;instertcustomernumber&gt;\"  \nMe: \"Alright you are C am i right?\"  \nC: \"yes\"  \nMe: \"Well i can see you have a monthly/yearly subscription.\"  \n&gt; Explaining: So our contracts goes, you can either choose to pay the entire price either monthly or yearly subscription.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \nC: \"Yes but i don't need the card anymore and you sent me a new one why?!\"  \nMe: \"Oh, that's because of the subscription you have.\"  \n&gt; Explaining: This is clearly written in black and white that if the Customers don't inform us timely before the end of the expiration date, we will take their silence as a consent for receiving a new card, which will be issued in the last month of the expiration date and the contract renews. To make sure that our customers don't forget this, we even go our way and send out letters of notification about their expiration of their cards and we do this X Month/s before the expiration date, reminding them about the contract condition, so that they have enough time left to send us a written letter with their signature to end the contract with the expiration date.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \nMe: *explaining customer our above conditions*  \nC: \"ARE YOU SERIOUS!? ON YOUR CARD IT SAYS IT RUNS FOR 1 YEAR!!!\" *at this point i'm fairly sure he must have received or at least read our letter of notification*  \nMe: \"Yes it runs for the entire 12 Months and as i have stated before since you didn't sent us any written information about cancelling the card, the contract has renewed itself.\"  \nC: \"YOU CAN TELL YOUR UPPER TIER MANAGEMENT THEY ARE RIPPING OFF FROM PEOPLE!!!\"  \n&gt; My Mind:*Are you for real? you signed a CONTRACT with the AGREEMENT of our ToS and etc.*  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \nMe: \"I'm sorry to hear your inconvenience, however this doesn't change-\"  \nC: \"Yes alright, i know. Whatever just tell me what i have to do, i don't want your service anymore!\"  \n&gt; Explaining: Alright so this is how it goes to cancel our annual cards. Our cards can be cancelled either at the end of the expiration date OR EVEN during the year before the expiration date. Now in this situation: Customer received new card = new valid contract, now what happens now is if someone cancels this card at the start or before the expiration date, this is also considered an \"advanced cancellation\". If you cancel the card in advance on X Date, we will not charge you the rest of the valid time that is still left on the card. However we will charge the cardowner &lt;insertamount&gt; fee for cancelling the card in advance before the expiration date.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \nMe: *explaining customer our above conditions to cancel*  \nC: \"ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? NOW YOU CHARGE ME &lt;insertamount&gt; FEE FOR CANCELLING THE CARD!? I'M NOT GOING TO PAY THAT FEE, UNBELIEVABLE WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE!? THIS IS CLEARLY SCAMMING OFF FROM INNOCENT PEOPLE!?\"  \nMe:  o-O  \"Sir/Mam you signed a contract it is written in-\"  \nC: \"I DON'T GIVE A S&amp;%§ ABOUT YOUR CONTRACT I'M NOT PAYING ANYTHING!!! DO YOU REALLY THINK I CAN REMEMBER EVERYTHING ABOUT YOUR STUPID CONTRACT AFTER AN ENTIRE YEAR!? YOU'RE GONA HEAR THIS FROM MY LAWYER AND I'M GOING STRAIGHT TO MY BANK NOW. I WILL TELL MY BANK TO CANCEL ANY DIRECT DEBIT REQUEST FROM YOUR COMPANY!!!\" - *CLICK*  \nMe:   -_-  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nWelp onto my next Customer.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nEDIT: formatting",

Just some background incase you didn't know, when you open a bank account usually banks do what they call the right to offset, so if you are behind on a loan with that bank if funds are available we have the right to pull the money per the agreement you sign when you open the account.\n\nMe- thanks for calling bank, this is supertac3. Can I have your name please?\n\nCustomer- hey supertac3, this is angry moron and I'm f******* pissed.\n\nMe- I'm sorry to hear that sir, what happened?\n\nCustomer- I placed a stop payment on company, company, and bank so that no payments from any of those places don't take a payment and you took a payment!\n\nMe- I do show the stop that you are talking about and I do show we stopped the payment originally but that was overridden by another department because the payment was past due.\n\nI went through this same conversation for 40 minutes before he escalated to manager. In my department we create tickets and when another banker edits your ticket you get an email so I was being nosey each time there was an update. So about an hour later I get a ton of emails and I'm like wtf. He called back about an hour later and did the same to another banker who just happens to sit by me and gets escalated to another manager, they give the same answer. Finally about 3 hours after that he calls in again doing the same crap so he was escalated to a manager above the previous managers. Looking at what that manager wrote on the ticket I couldn't help but smile and laugh. This manager decided to go through our recorded calls and got the call he placed the stop payment on and played it back for the customer to show him saying, \"Yeah I want to place the stop payment because I'm trying to piss off bank by not paying them so they will redo my contract\". We haven't hear back from him since then.",

'N for Nancy', 'M for Molly', 'A for Apple', etc, instead of the more official NATO alphabet. \n\nPoor old A-fer fell foul of this when he tried to explain - in earshot of a dozen of us - to a customer: \"A for Orangutan.\"  \n\nMemorize your phonetic alphabet, people.

No problem, start walking then through getting a password reset email sent and then going to that email and clicking the link inside. Everything is going good, she's PC literate enough to follow directions quickly and she is a pleasant caller.\n\nAfter she clicks the link it brings her to the security question challenge. I take a look at the question she chose to use (you get to pick one of several options when you first register the account) and see she went with the questions asking her what her favorite food is. A standard question. You get to type whatever you want in the answer field when first registering, and thats what you'll need to answer it with later. She's telling me she can't figure out the answer and she is trying multiple options but I'm not listening anymore.\n\nI had to mute my phone because I'm dying of laughter and getting my neighbor to come see the answer she had provided. Her answer, for favorite food, is penis. It's so childish and dumb, but it was toward the end of my shift and I'm tired and I didn't expect it. It took all I had to keep a level voice and finish the call. \n\n...And no we don't give them the answer so I ended up resetting the account and she had to register from the beginning.\n\nTLDR: customer was fan of hotdogs.\n\n\n",

        "text": "FTP so sorry for any formatting issues, and sorry but this one's pretty long.\n\nBackground, I work for a call centre handling car insurance in the UK.  This happened years ago, during a period of extreme weather in the UK, with heavy rains causing flooding, rivers bursting their banks and all that. Because it is so long ago, exact dialogue has long since receded into memory, and since the call took about 40 minutes I've skipped the boring bits for brevity.  Anyway, I get a call from a customer by the side of the road.\n\nMe: Good afternoon thank you for calling Motor Claims, how can I help?\n\nCustomer: Hi, I need some advice on what to do, I've had an, uh, incident.\n\nMe: No problem, but first, I can hear you're outside, do you need your car recovered?\n\nCustomer: Um, if possible, but I don't think you can.\n\nMe: Has it been flooded?\n\nCustomer: Sort of?  Maybe I should just tell you what happened.\n\nAt this point, the customer explains what happened to his car. He was driving down a rural road, and came to an old bridge.  There was a dip in the road immediately prior to the bridge, filled with water, and not realising how deep it was, he drove through it, getting water in the engine.  The car began to cut out halfway across the bridge, and so he pulled over to the side to have a look under the bonnet.  He decides to try revving the engine to clear the water, but accidentally put his automatic car in *drive* when he did so, which led to the car jolting forward, and, because the wheels were turned to the side from his pulling in, caused it to go THROUGH the barrier of the bridge, into the river.\n\nMe: Uh.  Wow.  I'm glad you're OK.  You're right though, I'm not sure how we'll recover the car from the river, at least not until the floods are over.\n\nCustomer: The police officer says I'm just lucky I still had the door open from checking the bonnet, I was thrown out of the car.  I'd probably be dead otherwise...oh, the officer wants to speak to you, can I put him on?\n\nMe: Sure. [I'm thinking, \"I have no idea what we're gonna do so that sounds like a good way to stall while I come up with a plan\"]\n\nOfficer: Hi mate, I just want to be clear cause the gentleman didn't say, the car isn't in the river.  The river's burst its banks and the current is massive. It's washed away.\n\nMe: Now, when you say washed away--\n\nOfficer:  The car is in the ocean.\n\nMe: [Loud enough for people at nearby desks to hear] I'm not sure we can recover cars from the *Atlantic Ocean*.\n\nCue turned heads and me nodding with a \"yeah you heard that right\" face to my colleagues.\n\nOfficer: Well, if it helps at all, it will likely wash back in at high tide, so you might be able to collect it after the tide goes back out.\n\nMe: OK, that sounds like a plan, any idea where it might wash up?\n\nOfficer: It could wash up on the beach, but honestly it's more likely to wash up in the nearby marsh.\n\nMe: I'm not sure we can recover cars from marshes *either*.  But I'll ask the local recovery company.\n\nSo off I go to speak to our local recovery team where the local agent advises me that they *can* recover from the beach, but if the car ends up in the marsh it will be staying there until a future archaeologist digs it up.  We set up the recovery anyway, just in case.\n\nAnd that's the story of the first time I arranged recovery of a car which took a swim in the sea.",

My job is to take the info from people who are broken down about their location, vehicle, amd where they would like it towed, etc. This story happened on my Friday (which was actually Wednesday) before I was supposed to leave work. The next day I was planning on going to the Emerald City Comic Con. The first day of the con. This is important. \n\nThat night, I got a call from an out of state member needing a long distance tow across the pass into Seattle. When I asked where they wanted it towed they said any shop as long as it was close to the convention center. I said, \"Oh! You're going to comic con!\" They were surprised that I knew and said they were vendors with a booth, so I said that our call center for the region was local and I was going the next day. (I don't think they believed me). I managed to get them faster service (nerds of the world unite) because they needed to set up that night (it's a long story which is full of little things peculiar to my job but I went WAY out of my way for these people and they knew it.) I clocked out, and the next day went to the Con. \n\nThe first thing I did was visit their booth. I picked up a really cool necklace they were selling and said I wanted to buy it. As I got out my wallet, I said, \"Well, the real reason is that I wanted to make sure you guys made it here okay.\" They looked at me, and slowly comprehension dawned on their faces. The look on their faces was PRICELESS. \"Oh!! YOU'RE the roadside assistance lady!!! Oh my gosh!\" They got so excited, and they were really really grateful, and tried to give me the necklace free but I insisted on paying. When I wouldn't take it, they gave me a free lanyard instead, and wouldn't let me leave without taking it. It made my year. I now wear my work badge on that lanyard to remind me that not everyone is an ungrateful SOB. Every time I see that lanyard I feel good about myself and my job. ",

To that end, we recently added two additional moderators to the moderation team, bringing the total number of moderators to 4. On average, posts caught in the spam filters or caught out by one of our automod rules are now reviewed within 4 hours (and in some cases within as little as 10 minutes).\n\nSince I took over we have seen a direct improvement in traffic and as a result of that, subscribers. I believe this to be due to A) Promotion of the subreddit to the wider Reddit community. B) The new theme/styling of the sub makes it a lot easier and friendly to navigate around. C) The quality of our content is now much more refined, meaning people want to return for more (in part due to the new rules and additional moderation team members).\n\nBack to subscribers, within the next few days we will tick over the 25,000 mark for the first time in the subs history. This strongly cements our place in the top 5,000 subreddits. Our next “target” is 50,000 and you as a community can help us reach that goal by promoting TFCC within the larger Reddit community (please respect the rules of other subreddits and do not SPAM!). If you come across someone who might enjoy our sub, let them know we exist!\n\nAs usual, this is a chance for you guys to give feedback on the sub. Please let us know if you have any suggestions, things you’d like us to change, things you don’t like or maybe even something you need us to clarify?",

We had to do it at renewal. Now normally there are two rules that apply:\n\n1) If any changes are made at renewal then policy is recalculated and a new amount needed.\n\n2) If someone is removed from a policy mid term via death then they policy holder does not pay any more.\n\n\nSo I have a customer removing a dead partner and a policy being recalculated meaning that the customer has a substantial amount more to pay. There are discounts I can give the customer to match the price but I need authorisation.\n\n The \"manager\" spent half an hour on the phone telling the woman that in no uncertain terms would anything be reduced etc. and so on. This woman was in tears, crying and I had to sit there and listen while pointing out all we could do and he refused.\n\n Now I know for a fact that the client's staff would of matched it, if she complained it would of been matched and so on. She would of been treated with compassion. He refused to.\n\n In the end she gave in and just paid it, crying while I took this payment from her.\n\n\n I felt so bad, but I wasnt giving up on treating the customer right. Now this manager was on his last legs as a manager, he was useless and management knew it but they needed him (outsourcer....) and gave him another chance. I did something that I should not of done, and if it hadnt of been praised by the client I would of been sacked there and then.\n\n I sent an email to the client and my operations manager explaining the situation. Needless to say, he wasnt a manager at the end of that day (but numbers, so he became an agent) and the woman got a massive refund and apology.",

The fine folks at BedCo (not the company's real name, obviously) have been fabulous about accommodating me and my needs and I'm immensely grateful, but I've been some combination of physically weak and emotionally wrecked lately.\n\nSo today I got a call from a woman who would have just annoyed me under other circumstances. The first words out of her mouth were \"I just had a face lift and I bought a $9,000 bed.\"\n\nOh boy. This is gonna be a fun call. She's on the brink of tears because she can't control her bed with her phone right now and it's giving her an error. Bear in mind that the bed comes with a remote control that was working just fine, and that operating it with her smart phone is a bonus, not a requirement. She's on the verge of tears as she explains that she bought this $9,000 bed *for* her face lift and it's not working now and whatever shall she do?! The notes show that this woman has called like five or six times since she got her bed a week ago.\n\nSo I start walking her through some steps. \"Is your bluetooth on?\" \n\n\"Of course it is, why would I ever turn it off!\" \n\nOkay. \"Can you force close out of the app for me? Press the home button on your iPhone twice and then swipe the app upward until it disappears.\" \n\n\"I don't know how to do that! It's just wiggling!\" (This means she pressed and held down on the app's icon.) \"I just had a face lift!\" ...Yes, so you've said.\n\n\"Can you unplug the [control unit] from the wall?\"\n\n\"I JUST HAD A FACE LIFT. I CAN'T GET UP!\"\n\nMeanwhile, I'm sitting here thinking about how she chose to have this face lift, and tomorrow I have to miss an entire day of work and several days thereafter to get poison pumped into my body so I don't die. I can feel myself starting to twitch.\n\nI walk through more troubleshooting with her, and she yells more and more about how she can't *do* any of this because she just had a *face lift* and she's in *soooo* much pain and our customer service is *just awful* because we're *making her do stuff*. Finally I agree to send a technician out--at no charge, normally we make you pay for that--to do something that she could do herself or have a friend or relative or spouse do for absolutely free.\n\nWe can't get a tech out until the end of the month.\n\n\"I can't stay on this phone call *another minute!*\" Click.\n\nI went home after that. The knowledge that this woman exists and can afford a bed that costs more than what I make in three months, while I have to muddle through a disease that would have been fatal if I hadn't gotten lucky and caught it, just drove me to tears. And I hope her stupid face falls off.",

Just got done with work, and had a great one today.\n\nCustomer called up, having problems logging into his bank's website.  I'll call him SpeedyNoReady, or SNR for short.\n\n&gt; Me: I just need to let you know, I do not work for &lt;bank&gt;, nor have any information about their website.  If you'd like, I'm happy to help make sure your computer and browser are working properly, is that okay?\n\n&gt; SNR: Yeah, fine.\n\nI get connected to the customer's computer remotely.  I open the browser, and do a 'standard' validation on it (make sure it can get to Google, a page to test adblockers, search for a few specific keywords).  Everything's fine.  I clear Internet Explorer's cache (of course he's using IE), but leave the cookies alone, and close the browser.\n\n&gt; Me: Okay, sir.  I've verified your browser is working perfectly, and even cleared the cache to be sure nothing could cause problems.  Could you try to bring up a few web pages for me, just to make sure it's working, please?\n\nWith me connected, the customer instantly tries to log into his bank's website, he doesn't read any of it, but it's obviously asking him to do a 2-factor authentication.  He just clicks next over and over and, wonder of wonders, it doesn't work.\n\n&gt; SNR: It's not working!\n\n&gt; Me: As I said, sir, I do not work for &lt;bank&gt;, and have no control over their website.  Also, for obvious legal reasons, I cannot control your use of their webpage for you.  Your browser is working perfectly, and you are able to get to that site.  Perhaps, if you'd like to slow down, I could read the web pages for you?\n&gt; \n&gt; SNR: Okay.\n\nHe instantly brings up his bank's page again, signs in, and...\n\n&gt; Me: Sir, please stop. Please stop. Sir, please stop. Please, sir, stop for a moment...\n&gt; \n&gt; SNR: *click*  It's still not working!\n\n&gt; Me: Again, sir, I was trying to get your attention there to stop.  It said something on the page.  Rather than clicking away from it instantly, I offered to help read that page for you!  Let's click back one time, and stop, please.\n\nHe does so.  I literally start reading the webpage to him.  He scrolls past it to the next button again.\n\n&gt; Me: Okay, sir, you've scrolled past the instructions again, I understand you don't want me to read the page for you.  I suggest you contact your bank for help using their website.\n&gt; \n&gt; SNR: Why won't you help me?\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: I'm trying, but, as I said, sir, you have to slow down so I can read the page to you, that's what I offered to do for you!  Would you like me to do what I can to help?\n&gt; \n&gt; SNR: Yes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: Great, please scroll up to the top, and I will read you what it says on their page.\n\nI proceed, again, to read very, very slowly, exactly what it says on the page.  It's telling him that they'd like to two-factor for this login.\n\n&gt; Me: Now, do you understand what it's saying?\n&gt; \n&gt; SNR: Yes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: Great, what option do you think would be best to choose next?\n&gt; \n&gt; SNR: This one.\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: Sure.  Let's read it.  That will send you an e-mail, containing your code.  Is that what you want?\n&gt; \n&gt; SNR: Yes. *click*\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: Great, please, check your e-mail.\n&gt; \n&gt; SNR: *clicks past the 'enter code' screen* It's not working again!\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: I apologize for not reading that fast enough for you.  Let's scroll up, and read what it says.\n\nI, again, very slowly, read the page, telling him to check his e-mail for the code.\n\n&gt; Me: So, go ahead and go into your e-mail, please.\n&gt; \n&gt; SNR: *Clicks next again instead*\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: Sir, do you remember what I just said?\n&gt; \n&gt; SNR: Yes, to check my e-mail.\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: You don't check your e-mail by clicking the 'next' button on this page, do you?\n&gt; \n&gt; SNR: No.\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: Okay, could you show me how you usually check your e-mail?\n\nThe customer opens his e-mail. Right at the top, there's a link back to the page, and the code he needs to type in.\n\n&gt; Me: Okay, now you'll...\n&gt; \n&gt; SNR: *closes e-mail* What am I supposed to do?\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: I was trying to read that e-mail to you, but you closed it too fast.  I understand you don't want me to read the pages to you anymore.  Is there something else I can help with?\n&gt; \n&gt; SNR: No, help me with this!\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: Okay, but we have to read, rather than just closing things.  Is that okay?\n&gt; \n&gt; SNR: Yes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: Great, go ahead and open that e-mail again, please.\n\nI proceed to read the customer's e-mail to him.\n\n&gt; Me: Now, that one-time code number, do you remember it, or would you like to write it down so it's easy to get to? (hell no, I'm not teaching him copy/paste)\n&gt; \n&gt; SNR: *closes e-mail* What code number?\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: The one I just read to you in your e-mail.  Do you remember it?\n&gt; \n&gt; SNR: No.\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: That's okay.  Let's open up the e-mail again, and re-read that e-mail again.\n\nI proceed to read the customer's e-mail to him again.\n\n&gt; Me: Now, once again, did you do what the e-mail said?  Did you make note of that one-time code number?\n&gt; \n&gt; SNR: Yes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: Great.  Now, go ahead back to your browser.\n&gt; \n&gt; SNR: *back to browser, clicks next, fails again*\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: I apologize, we didn't read again.  Let's slow down and read, okay?\n&gt; \n&gt; SNR: Okay.\n\nI proceed to read the page to him. I get to the spot where it's asking for the 2-factor.\n\n&gt; Me: What do you think you should type in there?\n&gt; \n&gt; SNR: The... the code number?\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: Most likely.\n&gt; \n&gt; SNR: *types in number, and slams next before I can tell him not to so I don't see his bank info, which proceeds to show up on my screen*\n&gt; \n&gt; Me: For your safety, I've disconnected from your computer.  It's not good to show your bank information to other people.  If you have problems using your bank's website in the future, it would probably be best to contact your bank.  Have a good day, sir.\n\nI then notate his account that he has problems using his bank's website, and has been referred, multiple times, to them for help using it.  We're here to repair broken stuff, not change your diapers.",

My son and daughter won't talk to me anymore.\"\n\nMe: \"Certainly, how can I help you?\"\n\n(Over the course of talking to this woman, I realize within the first 20 minutes of the call she has all the red flags for suicide.

I've been saving them up.\"\n\nW: \"I'm thinking, so, if I take these pills, I won't have to deal with this anymore. *I am going to do that when we're done with this phone call.*\"\n\n(An hour and half into the call, my boss logged on to facebook at 5am.

I'm afraid we don't have any in our database sir. I can do a quick google search.\"\n\n(Of course I didn't give him any information from the google search. I spent about half an hour talking with him to assess his mental state. He seemed like a good guy who just wasn't 100% there. He was also probably drunk. Once I was satisfied he would not hurt himself I ended the call.)",
