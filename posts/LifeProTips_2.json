        "text": "I’m not sure what to call this, and I can’t find anything backing it up, but I’ve waking myself up by having my white noise generator turn off about 15minutes prior to my alarm going off, and I haven’t had to hear that alarm for almost three weeks now.\n\nIf you want to test out how it works for you, there are a number of free white noise generators for phones to try out.  You will want one that has a timer function for turning off.  Good features to look for would be a non-looping sound, and the ability to fade out instead of abruptly ending (I’m fine with abrupt, but it’s jarring to my wife).  Just set it up to turn off a bit before your regular alarm goes off.  If it works for you, there are physical white noise generators that could be worthwhile looking into (I’m using the SNOOZ, but it’s too early for me to fully endorse it).\n\nFor me, I seem to become somewhat aware that something has changed, and I wake up but not abruptly.  I’ll wonder for a moment if it’s close to the time to get up, then I’ll realize if the white noise isn’t going it’s close to that time, then I’ll finally notice that the white noise has stopped as the brain fog starts to clear.\n\nPrior to this I made the jump from setting an alarm early enough that I could snooze it several times to setting it at the latest I could get up in time, and this has given me back some of that “I want a moment to wake up before I get up” without falling back into bad habits with the snooze cycle, while still having the peace of mind that an alarm will go off before I’m going to make myself late.\n\nI’ve also used the fancy sunrise simulating clock/lamps in the past, and while they worked they weren’t especially pleasant for me, and I eventually stopped using them.\n\nAn alternative way to do this if you already sleep with white noise (like a fan) would be to get a smart plug for it and schedule an off time.",

My previous job experience was just all part time at a movie theater and at Target in the Electronics section.\n\nI'd like to move back and start a career in HR. I know I have to start at the bottom levels but I was thinking about getting an Online Masters in HR/HR management.\n\nIs that the right thing to do?\n\nI was searching and there was a lot of recommendations on whether getting a Masters in HR management or Masters in Business Administration is better. Which would be better for my background and future endeavors? I know there's an option to get a second bachelor's as well but if I can just go straight into the Master's that would be easier.\n\nI know there's possible certifications that would look good to hire in the entry level HR positions as well through udemy, is that recommended or is there another way to start off?\n\nI know Target has an HR associate's position that I'd try to apply for when I get back to my home country, maybe to work part time in it as I take classes. Are there any other places that are recommended to break into the industry?\n\nIf people could share their stories on how they started in HR, I'd love to hear them as well. Thank you!",

Most of it is one non-moving block, with a couple of metal stems which can be easily removed and put back together. Just make sure to take photos as you do it!\n\nEven something like a circuit board might be fixable if the issue is an obvious one: something became disconnected, a capacitor exploded, etc. Not every issue will be obvious to fix. The great thing about the internet is that there's often someone who has a video on YouTube which describes how to fix a certain issue. \n\nWhether it's a keyboard which won't trigger on a certain key, a hydraulic control valve leaking, your PS5 not powering up, or anything else, just open it up and try to fix it yourself before tossing it (provided it's not under warranty or something)",

Since COVID and the intensifying negativity in the world at large, I have been on a mission to find a way to help the most amount of people regain some semblance of happiness in their worlds. Recently, I came across Barbara Fredrickson's book called Positivity, where I learned that a 3 to 1 positive to negative thought ratio is the tipping point for people to live happier and more resilient lives. The idea is that when we're more positive than negative, our perspectives are broader and we can see more ways to a goal or around an obstacle. Negativity narrows our focus - rightfully so when we are actually in danger. The problem is, we're not in as much danger as we tend to think, but by giving into negative thought patterns, we're limiting ourselves from seeing the various possibilities that are out there. \n\nAccording to Fredrickson, 80% of people fall below the 3:1 positive to negative thought ratio. I'm doing some research in my efforts to develop a program that will help people convert negative thought patterns into positive ones so they can more easily achieve happiness. I am wondering how this sub will score overall. Will you indulge my curiosity and help me on my mission by sharing your results with me? I set up the webform below to gather your results if you are on board - thank you! \n\n[https://podio.com/webforms/28445142/2268973](https://podio.com/webforms/28445142/2268973)",

I trusted the automated systems for cancelled orders or returns and believed those would just 'work'. On the fraud side, my cards have been excellent in alerting me on the rare instance where a card was compromised. With the number of charges per month (itemized) being so high, I never developed the habit of going through them in detail.\n\nThankfully I caught that a 6 night holiday hotel stay I had booked, then cancelled to adjust the dates, was actually double charged on my statement. This was through a major hotel's direct website (not a booking site). When I called them about it, they said that certain charges have to be manually refunded and because I did not call in when I cancelled and switched dates, the system did not know to refund me the money. That is a ridiculous system and there was never a prompt for me to call in. I would have just eaten it without catching it on my statement.\n\nThe only reason I took a closer look was because the monthly amount was out of range with my regular charge amounts. Now I'll be checking things regularly, not just when something seems out of order.\n\nTLDR: Cancelled and rebooked a 6 night hotel stay online through a major hotel's direct website and was not automatically refunded. Was double charged and had to call and request the charge be reversed. Look at your CC statements.",

The paper packet only has 60-70 questions while online easily has 150-200+ questions.

However, I discovered barebones computers, which consist of just a case that is usually as easy to transport as a laptop, but with the ability to upgrade almost every component. Although my barebone computer is restricted to a 2060 mobile gpu, its performance is excellent for such a small box. If you want to use it like a laptop, simply pair it with a mobile monitor and a USB keyboard. If you need to settle down, plug it into a heavy monitor and use it like a desktop computer. The flexibility of these little boxes is wonderful. Pairing a barebone computer with Oculus Air Link (a PC desktop inside VR goggles through Wi-Fi) feels like the most cyberpunk computer one can have today.   \ntl;dr: barebones computers offer the best of both worlds: performance and portability, making them an excellent choice for people who are uncertain about their next job or living situation.",

Along the skirt of the arena they had various stands set up; one of which was a mechanical bull…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend's dad fished us out of the crowd because he really wanted to see me get thrown… I guess since he couldn't legally do it himself this is how he would cope….so…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEager to show him up I got in line…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow a little background on me, I had never gone to a rodeo before, much less ride a bull. But I have been doing resistance training consistently for a little over a year; focusing primarily on grip strength and compound lifts…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I thought I'd have a fighting chance…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I was next in line and nervous as hell, but my girl was beside me so I had to keep that 🗿(while also trying to negotiate with the clearly wasted redneck behind the control panel)...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI handed the guy my money, hopped onto the bull, and held my hand up…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDown at 7 seconds…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you don't know much about bull riding and rodeos, 8 seconds is when the timer goes off and you're done…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, despite that full year of consistent 6 days a week training for 2 hours a day. I was only given 3 extra seconds…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my point in telling you this story is that no matter how good you think you're doing, or how much better you think you are, keep working, and don't take those days off….\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf life is a marathon you'd better be sprinting because your future wife, family, job, and fortune will be stolen by someone only 3 seconds behind you…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're looking for more mindset adaptations that'll lead you to success, here's a video that I believe will help: [https://youtu.be/\\_UbxWH3oXT4](https://youtu.be/_UbxWH3oXT4)\n\nWere all going to make it you guys...\n\nStay on task!",
