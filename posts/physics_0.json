Assume that the only force acting on it is Newtonian gravity from the liquid itself. By symmetry, we can see that if the water is initially arranged in a sphere, with no initial movement, then it should stay a perfect sphere. However, what if we arrange it in some sort of perturbed sphere (like an oblate spheroid, for example)? What would the equations of motion look like for this? My intuition tells me it would be cyclic, but I’ve not worked out any of the math yet. The two dimensional case of a circle might be a logical place to start, but is there a one-dimensional analog? Has anyone seen this problem or a related problem before? Any ideas?",

It's weird that the electron on the right has a specific wave function but then if we consider it as two particle system a new wave function comes about that describes both.

Assume the particles are non interacting but are still identical. (I assume non interacting means not entangled. Please correct me if this a wrong assumption.) Then the state describing them is separable, but how is this state now automatically antisymmetric? Does this mean if I decomposed this state into a set of antisymmetric basis functions it would always be possible, simply by virtue of the two being electrons? Surely both electrons could be in a state whose product was not antisymmetric.\n3. I understand that there being overlap (which we'll assume extends to infinity, exponentially decaying) of the wave functions means that if I find a particle at position 1, I don't know which particle it is. I'm ok with that but then we say that probability of finding particle 1 at 1 and particle 2 at 2 is the same as finding particle 1 at 2 and particle 2 at a 1. Why does this necessarily follow from the particles being indistinguishable?\n4. I don't know how to phrase this last question, but how does indistinguishability not matter in classical limit. It seems like if the particles are identical the same quantum arguments should apply, even if the wavefunction is sharply peaked.\n\nAny answers to any of these questions are much appreciated.",

So, as we know we are the only planet out there that has life. And we happen to have a lot of it. And we all have mass, and are on the earth. So half question is, do we contribute to the earths overall mass?\n\nLet’s say for this question it’s both. So I’ll phrase the question, and answer it with a “if life contributes to earths overall mass” or “life does not contribute to earths overall mass”.\n\nThe actual question:\n\nHow many living organisms would have to exist on the earth for it to turn into a star?\n\n\nEven if it’s not real, theorize on how it could maybe?

        "text": "Get ready for a story. I'll do my best to make this to the point.\n\nChristmas Eve 1995. In my father's cabin I'd just read a magazine article by Stephen Hawking where he theorized that black holes may be creating new particles. The story was short. It left me wondering why had he or anyone else not actually gone to further lengths to explore the limits of this concept? So, in 1 hour I did. I've already educated myself with Buckminster Fuller's Geodesics, and it's foundation; H.S.M.Coxeter's Projective Geometry V2.  This fano plane foundation of all things in compressible space became the building block of 7 boson formats I figured would be the limit to any 2 pole flow system, since the 7th final could only become a new version of the first if it added one more boson. 8 bosons around 1, and as such, would be the most conductive of all boson formats, not specific to electricity but energy in general. Energy being defined as the smaller half of particles in the universe packed full of particles without void. Yes, an infinite universe in this case. And it worked. It shows how a big bang isn't needed to explain redshift, since Stars are consuming the smaller half to make the larger half of all particles. The least recycled particle, the 2nd heaviest K-Meson, is most average in size. It's DeBroglie wave frequency matches that of the thermal constant, so there goes the only other proof of that ridiculous big bang out the window. Now, all I needed was proof.  Well, years and $270million later, the Ice Cube project did just that. My 2003 copyright and web page now sealed in the wayback machine at [www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Lab/6771/magnet.html](https://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Lab/6771/magnet.html) shows this concept of the neutrino wind and boson formatting, even if my atom model was off by 45 degrees. A small mistake corrected in the copyright. Next came Egor Babaev's type 1.5 superconductivity. This holds a pattern identical to my model of 95 when you stack them. It also becomes obvious with the models that 2 electron masses are necessary to explain atoms. This , now a 3rd predictive proof, came in those years. I suppose some other big ones have come by to prove my theory, but not until Azra Wind found the Palindromic Code pattern that matches the forces, did I realize that nobody has any reason to doubt Progressive Kinetics any longer. In fact, you'd be insane to consider any other option. The only physics that could possibly explain how particles could act like a computer, able to relate to the prime sequence, would be one using progressive kinetic reactions. Why? Because the counterflow of poles as particles alone, not Mickey Mouse functions of photons, strings, or any other Euclidian measure, will never explain how matter is the 3rd pole also in a flow yet caught as a disturbance among the others. Much like the last one out in a game of musical chairs, quarks always form in groups of 3 because of the chain of events stemming from the fano plane which can only implode and explode to and from a center intersection among bosons which format space to infinity. Think about it. There really are no other physics theories nor will there be, which could possibly define matter as a pole that flows. It may only flow in and out around the intersection, but nevertheless, it shows also how any attempt at forming a 4th pole will only result in adding a particle to one of the 3 which sprout from the fano plane of creation.\n\nI'm always open to debate, but don't get too rough. Respect the fact I did have this on the web in 96 and nobody else had anything close. My copyrights 2003 \"infinite universe\" and 2016 \"anti-gravity physics\" by Michael E Hanson.  You can find short videos I posted about this on rumble and youtube under the username mikefromspace.",

        "text": "&gt;\t“In the same way that an electron moving in an outer orbit of an atom radiates electromagnetic waves, a planet moving around the sun disturbs the gravitational field, thereby emitting gravitational waves”\n\nThis bit in Leonard Susskinds Book “The Cosmic Landscape” (and the fact that [visually](https://i.imgur.com/LWV38qw.jpg) the planetary model of the atom has been compared to planetary systems) lead me to think about the following question: How does the size of the sun in comparison to the solar system relate to the size of the oxygen nucleus in comparison to the atom? Are they similar not only in appearance but alsoin scale? \n\nOf course atoms don’t “look” like anything because to “see” at that scale has no meaning at all, but there’s other similarities:\n\nThe oxygen atom and the solar system have a similar configuration in that they have a core that contains &gt;99% the mass, and yet is very very much smaller than it’s whole from a volumetric scale. Its also surrounded by eight smaller things, either electrons or planets that are comparatively massless, but needed for the overall stability of the system. So let’s find out! \n\nFirst I calculated the solar system to sun radius ratio:\n\n7.300 x 10^12mm (furthest point of pluto from sun source: nasa.gov)\n\nDivided by\n\n0,7 10^12 mm (sun radius, source: nasa.gov)\n\n= 10.463\n\nNext the oxygen atom to nucleus ratio:\n\n37.000 x 10-12 mm (oxygen atom radius, source: bbc.co.uk)\n\nDivided by\n\n3,15 x 10-12 mm (oxygen nucleus radius, source: mathscareers.org)\n\n= 11.746\n\nIf this is true (fact check me) both ratios are both in the same order of magnitude, is this a coincidence?  Considering the scales are so vastly different (femtometer to billions of Kilometers) thats kinda pretty damn close of a scale. Is there some hidden mathematic principle that causes the relative stability of both systems? Input appreciated. \nAlso are there any other fun coincidences like that? I thought of this one below :)\n\n&gt;\t“The moon is about 2,000 miles in diameter and about 240,000 miles away. Just from that information I can predict that it will occupy an angle of half a degree in the sky. By pure coincidence the sun is four hundred times bigger than the moon but also four hundred times farther away. The result is that the sun and the moon look the same size in the sky, namely half a degree” - Süsskind\n\nTldr: \n📏 solar system/sun = 10000 \n📏 oxygen/nucleus = 10000 \nwhy? 🤔",

During my studies, I was exposed to different scientific fields and each field had a certain approach to study the phenomena of existence.

I know there \\*was\\* a certain amount of perceived (e.g. by administrators) prestige in publishing there. So a young person could say they are just doing what they need to do to survive.
