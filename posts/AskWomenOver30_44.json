I know because I still keep in touch with some of them as platonic friends and we followed each other on social media. It felt as if I am wondering if there is something wrong with me or is there anything that I didn't do right? I only ever had 1 relationship almost 10 years ago. Been on dating apps and meeting people but never felt any sparks towards any one I met. Most conversations with matches online always get fizzled out. I don't see myself as having high expectations and to be honest, I don't think I have any difficult expectation at all, as long as there is chemistry and I feel good about that person. I am wondering if anyone out there is feeling the same way as I do . Do share your stories, tips, opinions etc.",

        "text": "So I (35f) have been dating a guy (43m) for about 2 months, with no talks of exclusivity, *however* he did mention to me at one point that he only likes to date one person at a time, and that right now that person is me. I like him a lot, but I have, admittedly gone on a couple of dates after I met him, none of which I was interested in.\n\nWhen we were first dating, we went on a handful of dates before he told me he had a kid. I immediately thought it was a red flag that he hadn’t told me right out the gate. Turns out he was in a relationship about a year ago, and the girl had his baby, then they broke up because of her being shady / cheating. (Allegedly.) He says he was kind of caught in the situation, but loves his child. The mom has full custody for now. I was a little thrown off by this, especially how recent it all was, and decided to tell him I needed a break from us dating for a while. \n\nFast forward a week or two, I’ve had a little time to process, and we meet up again. Things are fun as always and I just feel that spark between us, so I decide to give it another shot. He says he’s really happy and really wants to be with me. We start regularly seeing each other and texting again. \n\nFast forward another week. We’ve just hung out, had a great evening and I’m at his place. I don’t know why I did it, except that I had a morbid curiosity, but I was in the bathroom and saw a parking stub in his trash. I fished it out and realized it had been from the night before, from around midnight to sometime past 3AM, for some parking lot downtown. Now keep in mind, most bars in our downtown close around 2, so that leaves at least an extra hour of… something. I was immediately thrown off, because I distinctly remembered us texting each other goodnight the night before, and him saying he was tired and going to bed. \n\nNow, keep in mind, I’ve gone on a date or two and not told him anything. But… none that late at night. And now I’m just, wondering what else he hasn’t told me. Our texts and hangouts have been very frequent, and I’ve had every indication that he’s very interested in perusing a relationship with me, and it honestly surprises me that he would lie or omit a late night escapade of some kind…\n\nAt this point the whole thing is just really throwing me off and I feel like I can’t trust him. Every night when we text goodnight I think “you liar…” but I don’t know if I should bring something up because A. We’re not exclusive and even I’ve gone on some dates, and B. Because I looked through his trash like a crazy girl. What should I do? \n\nTLDR: I really like a guy but found a parking stub in his trash saying he was out late at night, when he had told me he was going to bed. It’s early days so we’re not exclusive and I’ve gone on other dates, but this flat out lie just hurts and I’m not sure if it’s a good idea to confront him.",

        "text": "I work in health care and see about 2-4 initial consultations per week. Things have gotten weird and I just need to know other womens thoughts on it. \n\nSo initially I wanted to set my practice up to not treat men but obviously theres discrimination issues with that so I never did it. I did put on my website that my focus is on womens health but still about 40-50% of my client base is male when in my industry we were advised wed be treating about 10% male. \n\nThere have been issues. One guy came in and said to me, \"I saw your photo on your bio and just knew I had to come in\". I have had multiple men I have rejected on OLD seek me out and book in with me professionally. I have had an abundance of inappropriate comments about my appearance or how \"cute\" it is that I knock on the door before entering etc. \n\nIt came to a head today when a male client kept telling me I am a gift to the world and just me being who I am makes the world a better place blah blah blah. After his appointment when I was billing him out he fucking came around behind the front desk and hugged me. What?! So I've been doing the usual woman thing - am I too friendly, am I being unprofessional, should I close myself off more to these men but I literally dont even know what Im doing and frankly I dont think its my problem. No matter how friendly a male doctor has been to me I don't fucking hug him. Ugh. \n\nSo I was talking to a gf about this tonight and somehow it came up about if it was women doing this and my brain exploded. Of the 2-4 initials I see a week, when I send my follow up email the next day at least one every week takes the time to send me an email saying I am a gift, that my compassions is unparalleled, that they are so grateful to have met me.  Women have found my social media to send a note that I'm the easiest person to talk to that they have ever met and they are grateful for my care. And yes, sometimes when we have a session where we discuss powerful things or if they're going away for holiday and I wont see them for 3 weeks or something they give me a hug (Im not a therapist and in my field I have seen others experience this relationship with their clients, its not abnormal though it is such a frequent issue that we are specifically instructed on the best way to manage it in school - if the client is a hugger don't disengage but hug them in the treatment room so your next client doesnt see the relationship and think they are not receiving the same care) and I don't think anything of it. I just feel grateful that I can be a bit of a port in the insanity that is the sea of our current society. \n\nSo! Do you believe I should hold men and women to the same professional standards and just assume every guy telling me Im a gift means it in the same way a woman does or am I right to be a bit wary of that male attention and have the awkward conversation of \"I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression but this is a professional relationship so comments on my appearance or... like how do you even say aggressive appreciation for my quality of care???... are unwelcome and I need to maintain professional boundaries moving forward\" ... it just feels different with men but maybe Im being unfair.",

I took a lot of time off this summer to enjoy the weather, I have been super busy every summer that I can remember so I figured it would be a needed break but I’m not used to having a lot of time to reflect on things. \n\nI work in film and the hours are usually 15+ hours each day and when I’m not on a show I’m shooting smaller productions by myself. Work is unpredictable and it makes it stressful and also hard to plan things in my personal life. I had to cancel things I was looking forward to doing such as my annual Halloween party and my only trip (a cute air bnb 30 mins away) I had booked this year other than one in May. I also work alone a lot when I’m not on set so I don’t see ppl much so I am alone a bit and I think it makes me lonely/isolated.\n\nI just finished a brutally draining show and suddenly I have a ton of free time again and I feel like something is off with me. I feel bored, sad and tired and I’m not excited about much but then it changes and I feel like my normal self again for a while. I think it’s a number of things. I also don’t have a lot of friends that want to do anything other than drink every weekend so I’m feeling a bit unfulfilled in that area too. \n\nI guess I’m feeling a bit like “is this it?” Am I depressed or something?

We dated and now we’re married. \n\nThis morning I saw a text he sent his dad back when we reconnected and started dating. The message said “I’m seeing someone, nothing serious at all. But she serves her purpose”. Talking about having sex with me. \n\nIt hurt me so much to think of how I used to feel for him back then. To me, the relationship was going well, I felt happy and i was falling madly in love with him at that point. He seemed to be on the same page too, or so I thought. \n\nOn top of other issues we’ve been having, this one was so hurtful I feel like I’m shutting off. I’m considering leaving him and I think I will, but I have to wait to get my ducks in a row beforehand. \n\nIm so mad, sad, angry and very disappointed. I feel like an idiot. I wish I could go back in time and never have gotten back in touch. \n\nI’m just venting right now. Thank you for coming to my TEDXTALK",

I want to wait maybe 2 years and have my first at 24-25 but he would be 28-29 and I think when they turn 30 he will be 58-59 which isn’t bad but I want two more kids after that and he will be in his 60s. Is that old? \n\nI look at my parents they are at mid 50s and I’m the oldest with them having me at 30-31 and the youngest at 36 and she’s still in highschool. And my Poor sister when she’s 30 they will be 67-68. I don’t want to be those parents. I want my fiancé to be younger to be able to see his grandkids and form a relationship with them, etc. \n\nAnd then I look at my fiancés parents that had him at 24-25 and they are barley 50 and still thriving. And get to see his grandkids young etc. \n\nWe have a place and pretty financially stable. But I feel influenced by my friends who want kids at late 20s and not now so I just feel like I have no one to relate to.\n\nI honestly don’t mind being a mom i love him a lot I just don’t want to be those people who look back and miss my “old” life. \n\nAm I just overthinking things?

        "text": "It's a bit of a rant, but also I'm curious if this is a common experience.\n\nI was happily living an independent life a 2 hour flight away from my parents. Then got married, had a kid.. So they moved close to us, to help with the baby and have a closer relationship with her as she grows up. In some ways, this has worked out well. I had extra help with childcare, and now my 4 year old adores her grandparents and has lots of fun at their house. My husband gets along with them pretty well, too. We have family get-togethers, and all looks happy judging by the family photographs.\n\nThe big problem is, my mother is really, really into giving unsolicited advice and critiques. She will come over to see her granddaughter and talk to me for maybe 5-10 minutes at most while they play or get ready to take a walk. And literally every time, in that super short timeframe, she manages to criticize something. Usually something small. But OMG, EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.\n\nDuring family get-togethers, everyone socializes fine while my husband is there. But should he step away for a moment, she will quickly say something critical to me. Always in my native language, too, to make sure my husband does not catch on (since he doesn't speak it).\n\nMy daughter says she spent a day at home? We're not taking her outside enough, and she will be unhealthy because of it. \n\nMy daughter is excited to travel and see her cousins? We are making her too excited, setting her up for disappointment (because somehow, inevitably, the cousins will turn out unfriendly - or if they are friendly, the visit will be too short to be happy).\n\nI read an interesting but slightly scary book to the kid? I'm setting her up to have nightmares and anxiety.\n\nThere is a bit of clutter or an unclean spot in the kitchen? Mother will be sure to point it out.\n\nShe asks me for a list of what foods my daughter likes, \"just to make sure she can cook what the kid will enjoy\". Then proceeds to go over the list critiquing the items on it.\n\nThe criticisms used to be tedious discussions that made me feel like a student being scolded for a bad grade. I've stopped acting defensive though, because it only fuels the fire. My mother seemed to realize that when I respond calmly and rationally, most of her criticisms don't hold weight anymore and are easily dismissed.\n\nSo now there's a new tactic. She's started inserting this stuff into conversation in this quick \"oh by the way\" manner, and then goes back to whatever the main discussion topic was. It's so annoying and sneaky, because it makes it harder to follow up on and actually talk about. It's like she has to criticize, but is also conflict-averse. I don't know if passive-aggressive is the right word for it, but it feels like that.\n\nWith all this, I feel peeved after every family visit and interaction. I feel guilty at the same time, because my parents have provided so much help and love their granddaughter so much. I don't want to deprive her of that with my own negativity.\n\nSomething else that I'm resenting is that, before moving here, my mother was crying and angry a lot about how far away I'd moved and how she'd never see the baby. She pressured my dad for the move. Then they asked us if that's what we'd want (them living closer). But after seeing all the tears and the freakouts, was \"No, we don't want you to move here\" really an option? We said yes, they moved, and then we get this,\n\"We left our beloved home to be close to our grandkid, so don't you dare move anywhere else anymore.\"\n\nI feel like I am in chains of filial duty (the culture I was raised in certainly contributes). I'm so tired of this dynamic. I am an only child, so is my daughter. My mother has no job and no engaging hobbies. Her whole life revolves around the grandkid, even if she only sees her once a week. She's constantly worrying, looking up parenting articles, buying stuff my daughter doesn't need... There is just too much. I wish she would start traveling or find some friends or something. :(\n\nIs this normal? Have you guys experienced something similar? Am I overreacting?",

I’m currently visiting our home country for the holidays, and it was kind of difficult to get a hold of him, and when we finally did connect, he casually mentioned a girl, so i asked if he was dating anyone and turns out he is. He says it’s new and he’s happy and he really values the company and home-cooked meals… he also says he’s had a fear of starting a family for a long time but now he thinks he’s almost ready.  A part of me is sad about it.  I guess i just realized i feel so comfortable with him and respect him and now that he’s dating someone (and lives so far away) i feel like the level of intimacy we shared will never be the same. \n\nHe’s made all these promises of showing me around the city while I’m visiting and going on all kinds of adventures with me but I’m starting to feel like that’s unlikely and he’s just saying that because that’s what we used to daydream about. I realize a small part of me had some hope that we’d get together when the time is right (both single and sharing a city) but now i just have to see us as just friends and it hurts. Why does friendship feel so cheap in comparison? Should i mention anything or just let it go? Is my mind just playing tricks on me?",

        "text": "This will be long so I apologize in advance.\n\nI'll be turning 30 this February. Which I'm perfectly fine with leaving my 20s behind me, but I'm feeling lost as far as my career goes.\n\nI've been working as an optician for 7ish years now. I started in a lab when I was going to college, and decided to drop out of college and pursue an apprenticeship in opticianry because it was way more exciting, and I felt like it didn't make sense for me to rack up debt with college when I didn't even know what I wanted to do in the first place.\n\nIn the beginning of last year, I left the practice I had worked in for about 5 years due to an abusive, toxic work environment to take a job at a brand new practice because I thought it would be a better opportunity for me. Having the chance to be the head optician and the opportunity to curate the collection of eyewear as well as build relationships with reps seemed like a career dream come true, and at the time worth the stress of also being this practice's only employee.\n\nBut then, almost immediately after I started working in this new practice my life began to fall apart.\n\n2021 was stressful, but nothing compared to this year. I won't bore you with all the details but here are some highlights - husband got an excessive DUI from a car accident and totaled his car. Then I was in a car accident, someone ran a red light, T-boning me and smashing me into another vehicle. I had multiple fractures that took a few months to heal and still get random pains. Then, we decided to try and help an old friend whom I was stationed with in the Navy by inviting them to live with us, and it turned out to be our worst nightmare as they were incredibly abusive and manipulative and made us feel unsafe in our own home. They tried to break up my marriage too. Thank mother Nuit they left of their own accord right as we were finally getting the courage to tell them to leave.\n\nDespite all of my outside of work life stress, I have still managed to work my butt off running this practice by myself. \n\nAnd man oh man am I starting to feel the burn out. My boss provides me with zero benefits. No PTO or paid holidays, insurance, etc. And no end in sight either to knowing when I'll be getting any of those things, or even another employee to help with the workload and patient care.\n\nI have thought about applying at other practices, but there are some things I just don't agree with and refuse to compromise my ethics such as supporting a global monopoly (EssilorLuxottica) that destroys small and independent businesses. I looked for over a year before I decided to take this job, and I took this job specifically because the doctor/owner supports independent brands.\n\nOne good thing I guess is that I did get some money from the settlement from my car accident. It's not a huge amount, but enough that my husband and I decided we want to take some time off to enjoy some much needed alone time as well as work on some renovations for our house.\n\nI brought up the subject of me taking some time off last week to my boss and the conversation did not go well. He made a big deal out of it, stating running the practice by himself would be too hectic and stressful and not good for patient care, as well as he won't make enough money without me to break even.\n\nThis upset me a lot. It made me feel sub-human and that I don't deserve time off except for when I was hit by a car. He has gone on multiple vacations since I have worked for him and he's not even paying me for the time off, so I'm struggling to understand what the big deal is? I am so depressed right now. I need a break and some time at home will be much cheaper than getting institutionalized because I don't have insurance.\n\nRecently I have started working as a baker on the weekends in the restaurant my husband works in and I LOVE it. Growing up I always wanted to be a baker, until my family shamed me for it so I joined the Navy instead lol.\n\nThe restaurant is paying me the same wage I make in my office, and the head chef told me I can go work for them full time if I want to.\n\nI'm seriously considering it. Since the pandemic my customer service mask has been slipping, and it's been especially difficult since I started in this practice because I have no coworkers for support. I have to handle all patient interactions good and bad and it's starting to really wear me down.\n\nSo do I stick it out, in the hopes that *someday* I will have benefits and peer support again? Or do I take the leap, change my career path and pursue a passion? My husband wants to start his own business someday with food, and I would love to help him with that. I love the idea of us working our own business together someday.\n\nHave any of you made a career change like this before? Did you have any regrets? Experience any shaming from family or friends? Is being happier and less stressed worth the fear at first?\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my woes.",

I’m a pretty outgoing guy, hike, kayak, etc. so I have a neighbor,30+ F, who is also single and has 3 dogs- 2 corgis and 1 border collie. I love those dogs. They are absolutely the cutest floofs in the world. Whenever I come home from work, they are out and about doing their business and I give them scratches and kisses. Their mom, my neighbor, also loves my interaction with them and has told me to text her when I get home from work so she’ll know and let them out to play with me. I usually take her up on this advice. I also walk the three love bugs once or twice a week. So the last couple of times I went over to her apartment to play with the boys, she always asks if I am seeing someone and always offers to cook for us and game with me. I never take her up on that offer however I did take her out to a couple of restaurants and she loved it. We talk about a lot of things, politics, social justice, our values, our families, etc. So before Christmas before I tried to fly back to see my folks, I said good bye to her and played with her babies for like 2+ hours and then we got some Chinese take out. Before I left she gave me a long hug. I take this as a hey she’s a good friend. She just texted me saying that the three boys miss me and asks me when I’ll be back. I responded that my flight got cancelled and even though she was upset she wants me to come over to play with the dogs and she wanted to grab dinner as well. (I pay then she pays). Just fyi, I am no way a hot stud. I’m just an average guy who loves to play with dogs. I think we are just good friends. Am I mis reading this ?",

I have a real need to control my public image and what is out “there” about me because I am scared of rejection, tainted image and really not being in control. \n\nPlease note this isn’t in the narc way. I just had so much pressure as a young girl to be perfect and meet my parents standards and that standard has been placed higher over the years by myself. \n\nI am very selective about who I share my issues with outside of my therapist. I am not a trusting person at all and usually the advisor to most. When my ex and I were dating we kept it a secret from our mutual friendship group because they love to gossip and I am super reserved (my idea). He is more out there. I loved him dearly, he treated me badly and I disappeared. Cut all ties with everyone but 4 people, 2 of which knew I was dating my ex.\n\nWell you know I said people talk? 1 of the 4 friends who didn’t know I was dating my ex shared unsolicited gossip with me that sounded very much like my business. I was hurt because I didn’t know who leaked it and quickly dismissed the convo as I don’t even like gossip anyway. \n\nThis made me panic and change my number temporarily to just get my head straight. Rejection and betrayal have been huge triggers of mine. The reality is I’m embarrassed. I’m embarrassed by how my ex played and used me. I’m too private to reveal how abusive he was and how I had to flee from the relationship so he wouldn’t spark off because I really want him in my past. \n\nBut I’m embarrassed. My ex is a bum (sorry to say this) and just not someone I thought I’d ever date and I’m sure no one from our group would put us together. Let alone have him abuse, cheat and have a baby on me.\n\nI’m too old to hide from gossip and ofc I’ll be mindful of who I share things with but how do I get tough skinned? People will always talk and that in itself makes me anxious. Again, so embarrassed I lowered myself for my ex and for him to totally use and abuse me. It was awful.",

For example, I mentioned that I once was sexually accosted on a bus while abroad. A man firmly pressed himself against me as he was passing behind me. While we were laying in bed, he did this and said “I’m a (insert nationality) man pressing against you!”. I froze up for a moment and got up and left the room. It completely threw me off! I took space and then later asked him if he was trying to hurt me and why he would joke about something so sensitive. He didn’t have much to say but apologized profusely and seemed to feel terrible about it. Is this a red flag? Should this be forgivable?  He otherwise, has very strong values about women’s rights, LGBTQA rights, etc. He was raised by a single mom and has a very sweet and close relationship with his mother.

When I’m off work this isn’t much of a problem because I will just read at night and sleep in later, but usually I have to be up for work around 7. \n\nI’ve been managing this by taking a very small amount of Xanax upon waking and not being able to go back to sleep within 30 minutes- this happens about every other night. My new psychiatrist wants me to try a new med called mirtazapine that is an antidepressant I’d take nightly. I already take Wellbutrin so I hope I could taper off that if I start new one. My dream would be to not take any meds but also not sleeping is the absolute worst thing.\n\nI’ve tried a lot of other meds and behavior modifications.. do you do anything that has helped with this type of insomnia? \n\nThank you!",

It started to devolve. I was still healing from the end of a long term relationship and was very clear that I wasn’t looking for anything serious. It started to become clearer that this man was quite a bit different than how he presented himself. Talked about how open minded and progressive he was, but it slowly became clearer that he is quite conservative, held a lot of resentment towards women who had rejected him in the past, and absolutely does not have his life together. He did a few things that made me increasingly uncomfortable. Even though I was clear we had never been dating, he told me he wanted to become exclusive. I ended it, gently but bluntly. He got mad at our mutual friends for not talking him up enough and told them if *they* had put in more of an effort maybe we would have worked out. They told him to drop it and leave me alone, which I was thankful for.\n\nI am not super into social media because I’ve been bullied online in the past. I’ve worked hard to curate my social media use to remain small, mindful, and enjoyable and I don’t want to totally give it up. My account is private. I have less than 20 followers on Instagram. All very close friends and family that I want to actively share my life with even if I don’t post very often. I added this man at a point in time when it felt fun. My ex had hated when I posted anything on Instagram, and this felt freeing.\n\nI hadn’t spoken to him in months and it felt weird to have to see him on there so I removed him. He texted me a day later asking why. No hi. No asking how I am. Just point blank, “why did you remove me?”. We are both in our 30s. It felt juvenile. I don’t plan on ever seeing him again, why would I keep him as a follower?\n\nWas I rude? Are you just never supposed to remove people on Instagram? Do I owe him an explanation? Should I have given him a heads up? Should I care at all? What is the etiquette here?\n\nI removed my ex/ his family after we broke up but I gave them a heads up that it was for my own mental health and there was never an issue there.\n\nI didn’t mean to hurt any feelings, but I also don’t intend to keep everyone I ever meet on social media, especially people who ultimately made me feel uncomfortable, and it had been months since we last talked.",

        "text": "I think for the most part Gen Z already has an overall different view on this, but it is still SO prevalent in any of the Over 30 subs especially. A long term monogamous partner is the end goal and everything leading up to that is a waste of time, or unfulfilling.\n\nAnd why is that?\n\nWhy can't casual sex be fulfilling for some people? Why is being single what happens \\*to you\\* before you find \"the one\"? What's wrong with finding fun, excitement and yes, even fulfillment in dating multiple people? Why is non-monogamy still taboo? Why are all these things that fall outside of \"long term monogamous relationship\" seen as unethical, even shameful, or immature? Or at the very least, seen as that pitiful thing that \"singles\" do because they can't find a LTR.\n\nThe Over 30 sub is mainly Millennials and Gen Xers and we were all raised with these \"values\" that getting married and having a family is what you \\*do.\\* It's what mature, stable people do. Everything you do relationship/sex-wise before that (and after that in the case of divorce) is ultimately unfulfilling. Ultimately a time waster; singledom a placeholder until you find \"the one\" (again). Why do we insist on perpetuating this narrative? \n\nAgain, I think Gen Z has different views on this now. The marriage rates are going down, \"alternative\" relationship styles/dynamics are becoming more mainstream and accepted (when a 13 year old uses the term \"polysexual\" correctly, you know times are changing), and I think all of this is a good thing and should be encouraged. I think it's time the over 30 crowd stops pushing this narrative, that essentially, you can't be happy or fulfilled unless you're in a LTR, and that everything leading up to it is an unfulfilling waste of time. When you make choices for yourself, and not out of societal pressure or shame or fear of loneliness, etc, that to me is going to lead to a very fulfilling life.",

If I know I don’t have any other plans then I kind of plan out my time in my head and what I’m going to do. This isn’t really far in advance but case in point, on Boxing Day my boyfriend told me he was coming home from his mum’s the next day and would stop in to see me but wouldn’t stay over as he had tentatively made plans with a friend who was only free yesterday. So in my head I’d planned out an evening of Christmas cheese, port, online shopping, girly Netflix and an early night as I haven’t been sleeping well recently. My boyfriend got here and we went for a walk and to the pub, then he told me that his friend hadn’t got back to him that day to confirm so he thought he’d stay over at mine after all. I was completely thrown off because in my head I’d made my plans for the evening which I was looking forward to. He seemed rejected when I told him that, I tried to offer a compromise but it seemed his expectation was that I’d be happy to have him stay over and give him my full attention because I didn’t have any ‘plans’. \n\nI kind of hate the idea that plans with myself don’t count, but I get the sense that maybe other people don’t do this whole making plans with yourself thing. Other examples are where I’ve been invited out last minute but was looking forward to an evening of ‘me time’, or was planning to finish a sewing project or something. I always feel like I ‘should’ do the other thing but don’t always want to. I definitely am a planner and not really spontaneous because I like to know what I’m doing ahead of time. I can be more spontaneous if I’ve had a lot of time to myself and am feeling like I want to socialise, or if I decide to do something in the moment on my own.

I get Christmas cards of all of my cousins and their pets/fiance/kids, and to be honest, I'm not into these cheesy photos (no offense to those that are but to me it is cheesy).\n\nI told my bf of 7 months I wasn't doing Christmas gifts months ago.

I've told him I don't need any more useless stuff (he did get me another semi useless item), and I also told him my favorite stone, which I guess he mixed up. I feel bad because he tried, but he got it wrong (I said jade but he got me a turquoise necklace) and then said \"this is your favorite stone right?\" So I didn't really correct him, but he now thinks turquoise is my favorite stone since I guess he forgot I said jade when it came up a while back.

        "text": "For those who are only children that grew up with single moms, I am wondering if there is someone that can relate and maybe give advice for how they healed or at least knew that they were not seriously messed up by this relationship. Today I (32F) was on vacation with my mom (60) in a small town and she didn't sleep well. We only have one day in this town and it was scheduled to start raining at noon, so I said I wanted to check out a highly recommended preserve area before the rain and also get food - I had looked up a bunch of good restaurants to try.  \nOn the way there she mentions she doesn't have an appetite since she didn't sleep well so I assumed she wasn't hungry, so I took us to the preserve first. It turned out to be a 3 mile flat trail (literally through horse fields), which was longer than we both expected, but she didn't say anything so we hiked it through to the end. We had a traumatic experience with an unexpected river crossing (required taking shoes off and walking through shallow water) which was not in the reviews and I didn't know, and my mom was not happy about this (asian lady, likes to stay clean/warm, not outdoorsy). Then, we went home and cleaned up and went to a restaurant, but it was raining pretty hard now and the line was super long and it was unclear if there were even available tables and the menu was also confusing so I decided to check out another place. The other place was a 5 min drive away so we got there and as we were looking at the menu, she suddenly blew up in public and went on a rant about how food is so important to me and why I always have to eat organic and blah blah blah (the restaurant happened to have organic ingredients, i didn't even know. it was just a highly recommended place in this hippie-ish town). She slams the menu on the counter next to the cashier and attempts to storm out of the restaurant and says she's going back home to the east coast (she's visiting me in california and we were in a california town for vacation a few hours away). She refuses to order and instead buys a banana. I manage to get a hold of her backpack so she doesn't just walk away and eventually she calmed down but still (even now) does not apologize for blowing up in public. She blames it on me for making such a big deal out of food and says if it's raining and we're tired we should just eat whatever (which is a personal choice), but she did not voice any of this and when I ask her to communicate her needs, she says shes afraid I will say no.  \nThis gives me flashbacks to one holiday time she chased me to the bathroom with a knife because i opened my christmas gift early. I was in middle school. When I brought this up today, she says it's because I was crazy and drove her to that limit.  \nI also sometimes have nightmares or flashes of thoughts of my mom doing something crazy. During the pandemic, she threatened suicide at her lowest point ( but a lot of people in the pandemic were suffering) since she lives alone.  \nI feel completely stuck because I don't really have any other family and I'm an only child/no siblings. I absolutely resent her behavior, but also she raised me on her own and when she doesn't blow up like this, she's obviously a very dutiful mother and flew all the way across the US to help me move several times this year. I'd like to know if this is within the realm of normal difficult family dynamics that everyone has but doesn't often talk about or if I should be seriously concerned that this has impacted me in ways I can't even remember (I do not remember a lot of my childhood interactions since the past few years, esp pandemic, have been rough / full of changes). And yes, I've been going to therapy since 2015 (have seen many therapists, have tried many types of therapy/meditation/whathaveyou) but feel stuck in that I kind of know/understand everything but not sure how I can \"move forward\" or how I can tell that Im OK or not?",

When he broke up with me, he said it was because we didn’t have sexual chemistry and everything else in our relationship was great but our sex life. He had made no efforts to work on this and one effort to communicate it. He was very detached from sex. He refused to pleasure me. \n\nI logically know that he has intimacy issues and that he now admits trauma has impacted his emotions. \nEmotionally, I am unable to process this rejection as having nothing to do with my sexual- and self-worth. Sometimes i think the problem is that my intuition and gut says that it was his intimacy issues, but he was telling me our lack of sexual chemistry was the problem and it causes me to feel so confused and insecure. I feel like I would feel validated and okay if he just admitted it was all his fault. I can’t seem to validate myself. \n\nI am already in therapy but I’m wondering if anyone has any practical advice.",

They travel to school each day with him as he’s connected to their school but not actually  in it. Arrangement is convenient for them and him. \n\nHe has a history of depression and has been on meds on and off during his life. He’s currently not happy and hasn’t been for some time. I think this is in part just him and where he is in life at present, having spent the best part of the last 15 years glued to a computer for online gaming, watching movies etc. the kids are old enough now to note this as well and that makes him feel worse. I think he’s also unhappy in the marriage.\n\nThere has been a number of breaches of trust that I personally can’t let go of, but I don’t bring these up generally, nothing can be done. The most recent was him sleeping with a coworker over a period of 6-12 months. She started demanding more and more of him and he eventually told me about it. He felt awful about it. But yeah, I’m kind of done re: trusting him not to do stupid things.\n\nThe thing is, I do love him and he does me. The thought of hurting him in any way is awful to me. I just don’t want to be with him beyond raising the kids.\n\nOnce they graduate in under 3 years, they won’t need to travel daily with him and an opportunity for me to separate will open as the kids could then be more able to spend weekdays where is best and convenient for them.\n\nThey chasm between him and me is just so great now I don’t even want to bridge it, I just want him to be ok and me and the kids too as well. It is such a relief when he is not around and it’s just me and the kids.\n\nUplifting and practical advice anyone?",

We had a 6+ hours long hangout on Christmas Day where we ate, talked, played games at an arcade, walked around the city and enjoyed each other's company; we kissed several times (at his behest). It was lovely and he's wonderful, intelligent and respectful.\n\n\nWhile we were on the train en route to the restaurant, he looked at me and said, \"I can already see that you're really innocent and extremely nice. That's very rare for a woman in her thirties.\" I know it was meant to be a compliment or some shit, but it REALLY bothered me. I don't want to end up dating yet another selfish punk who is only interested in me because of my kindness/generosity. Once a guy blatantly said that the only reason he liked me was because of how I was with him (what I do for him). 😑😑😑\n\n\nDo you think I'm hyper focusing? Perhaps I should have asked him to elaborate on that statement? What would you do?\n\nHe asked to see me again, but I don't know...\nI don't have another one-sided relationship left in me.",

        "text": "I’m coming out of a multi year relationship and am feeling like I’ll eventually (when I’m ready) be entering the dating world differently than when I left it - no fuqbois, no pick-me energy, no filling evenings with dates when I have no plans, and finally placing a high value on shared values. I’ve been looking for podcasts that cover healthy communication in relationships and dating but they’re seemingly nowhere to be found. I end up finding podcasts like Finding Mr. Height (bonus points that the hosts are in NYC like me) and will hate-listen to them as they seem to be in a dating phase I’m trying to move away from. I can’t even begin to find a podcast that’s open about how relationships actually are. Anyone got any good suggestions?",

        "text": "tl;dr - great date/chemistry with a girl that’s leaving the state, should I let it be or try to reach out again/say my peace?\n\nBackground: I’m a single guy who matched with someone on dating app, did the usual pleasantries but for unforeseen reasons she is moving back to her hometown out of state (she’s in her 30s, I’m in my 40s, not a huge gap)\n\nThings started out fun enough and there was a good back and forth fora bit until a week or so in, there’s radio silence. I interpret this as a dating app loss of interest thing (fyi - I’m not the pen pal type, if there’s a connection/rapport, I’m not one to wait on asking a girl out so I didn’t assume that’s what it was). She comes back a week later and says she has to move (not getting too into the details but it’s for family reasons), she gives me the “wish you all the best” message. I understood loud and clear but I enjoyed the back and forth and I always feel for people going thru stuff especially during the holidays, I basically say if she’s interested that I’d up for being friends/chatting, really out of character for me on a dating app but ya the holidays are rough! I get an unexpected response that she would be interested in grabbing a drink…do the logistical dance and there’s a date!\n\nI’ve done a lot of (fruitless and fruitful) dating in ‘22 but usually there’s always jitters but not this time, I felt at ease mainly because I pictured this as a friendly hang out and not a date-date. We meet and it’s pretty chill and we get to know each other…we end up going to another place as the first wasn’t our vibe exactly. Things are all super pleasant and there’s a little playfulness on the way to the other place and more getting to know each other. At the other place we get seated by another couple and at moments I couldn’t help but compare the usual “what do you do for work” first date questions they had to the deep and insightful stuff I was getting to hear from my date, there was just something utterly beautiful about it. There was a lot of presence, vulnerability, openness. This is where I was hooked even though I still hadn’t realized it. End up taking her home cuz her dog needed to be walked, to which I joined. The dog was a bit skittish so it wasn’t ideal and when finished the walk and got to her place, she says she’s still coming back for some stuff before the final move out of state and maybe us getting together again. We kinda rush the goodbye because the dog got off leash and I go to give her a hug (I’m still thinking this is friendly and really isn’t going anywhere), as I’m leaning in my instinct is to kiss her but I divert just for a hug… but I also sense she was leaning my way for a kiss. As I pull back from the hug I realize what just happened and (insert non consequential dialog I said to her here) I go in for a kiss and it’s met agreeably by her, I swear she initiated tongue first but honestly I was just taking it all in, it was simple and I finish with another simple kiss. \n\nOn my drive home I was smiling uncontrollably and the slow burn of catching feelings had begun (at this point I was still just “I’m bummed she’s leaving but glad we had a brief moment”.. I basically text her as much after I got home). Day later got a response saying she’ll see if she has time to get together before she leaves. I left it pretty chill there and pretty much followed up only a week later with a merry Christmas text. I’m trying to give her space to focus on the important things she’s going through but figured the messages would let her know there’s an interest… in what, I’m not sure, maybe just see her once more, maybe to have some capacity in her world (I’ve obviously haven’t thought this out very well!). \n\nSo here I am, I feel a bit silly that I shared a moment with someone and it became my highlight date of the year and feelings ensued… fully knowing she would be moving away. My nerdy Star Trek side remembers a line “just because a girl runs away doesn’t mean you don’t follow”, but this year has taught me that some good dates end up in make out sessions and nothing else, it’s an adjustment in my dating IQ but in this situation I’m at a loss if that was the case or if there was something there. So here I am trying to figure out if: A) Give it space and see what comes of things, B) send her another text (last went unanswered) and let her know the beautiful impact she had aka ‘dare greatly’, C) chalk it off as just a moment and find my own closure/move on and end all contact, or option D that I’m unaware of but you’ll give me in the comments?\n\n-Somewhat dozy in CA",

        "text": "I (35F) do not have much relationship experience. I dated someone for five months almost 8 years ago and that's it. I met a group of people online just before the pandemic and have played video games with them every night since.  One of the guys (34M) and I had some chemistry and we have been talking for the past six months. I don't really know what we are doing since it's long distance, but I am just enjoying it a day at a time for now. We are not official, have not had a conversation about that.\n\nI am a very emotional, big feelings person. My ex told me I am \"too much\" in regards to that, so I have been trying not to be that way with him. He disclosed that he has always struggled with feelings and communication around then in his past relationships. \n\nOn Christmas  my mom fell and was screaming for me to call 911 while I tried to help her up. It was horrible and when I talked to him that night and told him what happened, he didn't say anything. Then I started tearing up and crying a bit and apologizing for crying and he was still silent on the other end.\n\nI just wanted some acknowledgment or \"I'm sorry to hear that, is she okay?\" or \"You don't have to apologize\" or literally anything, but I felt alone and it made me more sad. My ex was the same way, uncomfortable around feelings, and I told myself I never wanted to do this again, yet here I am. Other than this one difference we haven't had any issues; we have very similar interests, core beliefs, political beliefs, values, and he makes me laugh more and harder than anyone I've ever met.  I could really see this going somewhere. \n\nI want to communicate that I need something from him, but I don't want to come across as needy or nagging. I am so scared of pushing him away because I don't get many chances to meet people in life, and I don't want to blow it. Does anyone have a suggedtion on how to best do that?  It probably would have been helpful to say something in the moment but I just.... don't want to ruffle feathers, I guess. Thanks.",

        "text": "I feel like a failure every time I think about retirement. I think it's a mixture of anxiety about future unknowns and my current financial inability to save. I have a government job that will supposedly provide me with a pension - and they take a hefty bit if my paycheck for it -, but I don't hold much hope that it will still exist/be able to deliver in 30 years. Same with social security. If I was saving 20% of my take home pay, like recommended, I would be saving ~$10,000/year. I am lucky if I manage to put 4k in my IRA every year. It just sucks because I feel like I'll be anxious about this for the next 30+ years and in the end I will have failed and be unprepared for retirement. It's stupid because I'm doing the best I can, but this angst about the future is ruining my ability to sleep soundly in the present. Anyone else have similar worries? How do you deal with it?",
