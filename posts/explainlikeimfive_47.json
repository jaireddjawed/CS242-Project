Even though there is congestion and mucus discharge from both sides of my nose, I have absolutely no pain on the right side of my face at any time during the sickness. I cannot think of any reason why my left side experiences this pain- my face is not asymmetrical beyond the norm, my wisdom teeth are removed in both sides, I sleep on my back, there’s no unequal pressure applied to my face (at least that I can think of), etc\n\nUpon looking this up, it seems that one-sided sinus pain like this is the usual case, but there’s no reason given! So I’m left with these lingering questions and any insight into any of this is appreciated:\n\n- Why is sinus pain most often on one side of the face?\n- Why is it always recurring on the same side? (Is this the case for everyone?)\n- Does everyone’s face “choose” a different side to be inflamed or is the left side somehow more prone to this sort of sinus pain in general?\n- Why does the other side of the face have no pain even though it seems to be equally as congested? \n\nAgain, these are general questions, “inspired” by my own sinus pain experience, but looking to get a better understanding of the topic!
