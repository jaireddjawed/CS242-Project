And by safe I’m strictly talking about physical health effects. Because obviously if I’m in the state of wanting to be delirious, mental health is already out the window.\n\nDelirium can be reached by staying awake for 3+ days straight, by withdrawing from alcohol/benzos, or by taking delirium inducing drugs, such as Datura or large doses of Benadryl. At least those are the main methods I know of. But none of these are healthy at all and can cause serious damage to the body and brain. I’ve binged on Benadryl before and it can cause serious short term memory loss for days afterwards, and it has bad urinary retention too.\n\nSo my question, is there any actually somewhat safe way of going delirious and hallucinating? I don’t wanna give myself dementia or liver damage or anything wack like that",
