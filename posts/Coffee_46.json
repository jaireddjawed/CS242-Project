I'm very beginner in all this and for grinding the beans I got a basic blade grinder which I also know isn't ideal. The thing is, the very first time I made it in my ESPRO french press it came out amazing with a bit of a nuttiness and a slightly citrusy aftertaste.   \nnow, I can't get that taste at all. I don't really remember the ratios or whatever I was using that time which makes this extra difficult. I've tried 1:13, 1:12, 1:16 and probably some others with a 4 minute steep but it just keeps getting this very strong, bitter taste without any flavor. Needless to say it tastes terrible lmao.   \n\n\nwhat are some tips I could implement to get a better cup of coffee using a french press and these beans?",

Around Christmas I got myself a Flair Pro 2 with a royal grinder, a temperature controlled kettle, and some chemex papers. The coffee was ridiculously good, but I needed some better beans.\n\nI decided that I wanted to get into single origins, mainly because I want to see what tasting notes I could pick out. That's when I found out about natural Ethiopian Yirgachefe. I went to a local roaster called Deeper Roots and bought a bag and another from Red Bird coffee online. I grinded the beans a little more coarse and brewed at 205°c to extract more fruit taste and holy shit... I had no clue coffee had those notes. The Deeper Roots bag smelled exactly like a strawberry, almost artificial and the Red Bird tasted like a blueberry muffin. The Red Bird beans didn't smell in the bag to me, but when it was brewing I could smell and taste it whereas the local roaster's coffee was more on the smell rather than the taste. The taste of the strawberry turned more into a acidic lime note when brewed.\n\nAnyways I guess that just set off a whole journey for me with coffee tasting notes. I don't know if everyone can taste the notes right off the bat but I have experience brewing beer, so hop smelling and tasting helped me get a feel for tasting and smelling certain notes.\n\nDoes anyone know any other origins that have distinct tasting notes I might enjoy? Any recommendations for what to try next or notes to pick up on? I'm a fan of the weird, distinct out-there notes so I'm open to try anything.",

Previously cafetiere coffee has been our mainstay, with fresh subscription beans and a Hario Skerton Pro hand grinder. \n\nDisclaimer: I'm new to home espresso creation. Over the last week I have been consuming /r/coffee, James Hoffman, and coffee itself, chasing ideal extraction results from our grinder and machine.\n\nWe've homed in on producing some lovely tasting shots that have a good balance of acidity and bitterness. However I'm struggling to get an ideal extraction time and ratio without over-extracting and getting too much astringency. Extraction is happening quite quickly. \n\nAdvice on moving forward, or are we within guidelines here enough to not worry if the shots takes good? I may be guilty of chasing 'perfect'. Curious if any of you have had this same setup. \n\nThe details: \n\nBean: local roasters bean, ~2 weeks old, solid medium roast. Slowly been churning through 500g as we try to dial in. \nGrind: 8 on the Sage Grinder Pro. \nDose: 20g. We've found best results with higher doses - started lower on ~17g. This doesn't overload the basket, it takes 16-22g I believe. I shake the grind in a different vessel for a few seconds before getting it into the basket to try to de-clump the coffee.\n\n**Output**:\n\nTypically I get ~50-55g of espresso out in about 22 seconds. For a ratio of ~2.5. \n\nGoing finer does result in a slower pull, but not overly, i.e. a grind setting of three results in ~23.5s extraction time, for a slightly smaller ratio, but bitterness starts to kick in more. \n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "This might sound like a silly question as the whole point in having a ratio of coffee:water is that you can scale it to any volume you like. However, in practice I've found this not to be the case. I find that when making larger volumes of coffee (2-4 cups), but I stick with the same ratio as I would for a single cup, the resulting brew is considerably stronger.\n\nFor example, for cafetiere coffee I typically use a ratio of 1:12. For 1 cup for me, that gives 25g coffee to 300g water. It therefore follows that for 2 cups I should use 50g coffee and 600g water. However, the coffee made for 2 cups is considerably stronger than the coffee made for 1 cup. I should note that all other variables are kept constant: brew time, grind size etc\n\nHas anyone else found this? If so, do you have a method to compensate? Or is my maths just terrible?",

        "text": "My Crossland CC1 espresso maker has been a problem child from the very beginning.  The steam boiler can't regulate its temperature and it runs away, causing SH errors (steam too hot), and burning up the thermal fuse (216°C / 420°F ), which cuts the power to the steam boiler, resulting in E2 errors (steam boiler not heated up within 3 minutes).\n\nThe first time I emailed Seattle Coffee Gear and BillC about this issue, Bill sent me a new thermal fuse (Thanks, Bill!).  I replaced it, the machine chugged along for a couple more months and then burned the fuse again.  By that time, Seattle Coffee Gear told me the machine was out of warranty, I would have to pay an arm and a leg for their service tech to even look at it, and it would take a few months.   \n Also, BillC completely stopped responding to any emails or calls.  Apparently this is a one-man company, he's doing the best he can, whatever.  Don't expect to get any customer service whatsoever with this machine.  Don't buy this machine.\n\nBut what if you already own a CC1 and it's your only espresso machine and you want to continue to make hot lattes?  What if you don't want to pay hundreds of dollars to ship the machine to Seattle and be without espresso for a few months?  Well then, you're on your own.\n\nReplacing the thermal fuse is pretty easy.  [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/juvqsn/crossland_cc1_sh_e2_error_fix_thermal_fuse/) goes into detail about it.  I replaced the fuse 5 times so far.  But this time is different.  Now, when I turn it on, the steam boiler runs at 100% power and never shuts off.  It will immediately burn the thermal fuse unless I either turn on the water or cut the power.  I checked the resistance of the temperature sensor: \\~100 k-ohm at room temperature, and lower resistance when the boiler heats up.  Seems to be in-spec for what I assume is a [100k thermistor](http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Datasheets/Thermistor-100K-datasheet.pdf).  The controller seems to be receiving a valid temperature reading, but it is not cutting the power to the steam boiler for whatever reason, causing thermal runaway.  Maybe some component on the control board has failed.  SCG would probably replace the entire board (if parts are even available for this thing anymore).\n\nBut I want my latte right now.  It makes espresso just fine.  No issues with the coffee boiler, just the steam.  So I came up with a temporary fix.  I took the power switch out of an old printer and spliced it in to the power connection to the steam boiler.  That way, when I turn on the main power to the machine, I at least have a crude way of controlling the steamer temperature.  As you can see in the picture, I am using a meat thermometer to monitor the temperature of the steam boiler.  When I flip the switch, the temp starts rising rapidly.  At 380°F the front display throws an SH error, and at 420°F the thermal fuse burns up.  So when I see 300°F I flip the switch to off and open the steam valve.\n\nIt's jury-rigged as all get-out, but it kinda works, and I'm enjoying my first warm latte in several weeks.  Eventually I will cut a hole in the side of the machine to mount the switch, and add a more permanent temp sensor.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/WJ8rUpU](https://imgur.com/a/WJ8rUpU)",

        "text": "Hello all,\n\nI see that many coffee experts, including u/kingseven in both v60 recipe videos, suggest using the plastic v60, and virtually every recipe suggests a water temperature over 90 degrees Celsius. Yet I realize that the Hario manual here: [https://www.hario.com/manual\\_pdf/VCND-02B-EX.pdf](https://www.hario.com/manual_pdf/VCND-02B-EX.pdf) lists its plastic dripper, made of \"AS resin,\" as having a heat resistance of only 90 degrees Celsius (pages 8 and 19 of the .pdf). As far as I know, the current literature on the food-safety of plastic materials suggests that even food-grade plastic leaches chemicals, especially at high temperatures. Isn't it odd to be pouring almost boiling water on a plastic resisting only 90 degrees? Even if we were to accept it is resistant against higher temperatures, I feel like the specialty coffee community embraced the plastic drippers like this one, Aeropress, Clever a bit too fast, when we don't yet know of their health effects and have many ways to brew delicious coffee in glass/ceramic/metal. As far as I can see, a discussion of the safety of plastic is totally missing when people are recommending/celebrating these brewers.",

        "text": "Hi Friends, I received my Fellow Ode Gen 2 with SSP Burrs last night and ran some coffee through at a grind size of 6 to see how the grinder worked and to test out the work flow of it. I ran about 40 g through, once an hour for approximately 3 hours. Nothing absurd, and a reasonable thing to expect for someone brewing at home. I immediately noticed a few issues:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, the grinder makes an awful screeching noise  when grinding. At first I thought it was maybe because the burrs need to be broken in but this sounds like something bigger is up. It is incredibly loud. \n\nSecond, the grinder came scratched. \n\nThird, after I ground at 6 I decided I wanted to grind at 5, since that seems to be a reasonable thing to expect a grinder to do. When I went to turn the dial, I was immediately met with resistance and the dial would not turn. Only after I turned the dial to the right, ran it with nothing in it at a size of 11 for 5 seconds and turned it off, was I able to turn it back to the left to 5. I used the knocker after grinding the first time and it appeared all of the grinds fell out so there should not have been any residual grinds left in the grinder. This morning, after I brewed my first cup with this, I tried turning it to the left, again after using the knocker, and it would not turn left to a finer size. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFourth, Fellow advertises that the grinder no longer randomly drops grinds after using the knocker. Well, this morning low and behold, I walk away from my grinder to go and sit and drink my coffee and guess what falls out of it (YES I USED THE KNOCKER), ABOUT 2 GRAMS OF GROUND COFFEE. I take the little brush they provide and clean out the chute and another gram or so falls out, showing the grinder is in fact holding on to grinds. I thought they advertised (and youtube tends to show this is the case), that this should no longer be an issue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a $500 grinder advertised to be an improvement on Gen 1, this does not seem to be much of an improvement if i cant even change grind sizes easily. I reached out to customer service but wanted to see if anyone here had a similar experience. I'm hoping I just got a faulty grinder or something.",
