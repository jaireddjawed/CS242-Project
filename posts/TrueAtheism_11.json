        "text": "This past weekend my aunt was stopped in traffic when a pickup truck hit her going 90mph with no signs of braking. My aunt and her two grandchildren were killed and another one of my cousin's daughter, who my aunt was also babysitting, survived the crash without even a broken bone. She was awake through the entire thing and has been telling everyone that she saw a bright light and angels came down to take the others. Of course this has brought a lot of comfort to the rest of my family but as someone who doesnt believe in angels or god I still feel the same. The only thing holding everyone else together right now is the thought of them in heaven but I don't believe heaven exists and it fucking sucks. \n\nMy aunt was the kindest, most amazing woman in the world. I have nothing to do with most of my family because most of them hate me because I grew up to be a liberal atheist, but my aunt constantly told me that she still loved me. She never once talked about religion around me and just treated me the same as she always did. Her daughter treated me the same and was always one of my favorite cousins and her kids were so incredibly special to me. I'd always said i never wanted kids unless i knew for sure they would be like hers. They were the sweetest, happiest children you'd ever met and the only kids i cared about and really felt like i was watching grow up. The oldest was only 9 and the last time i saw her she told me about a youtube channel she was starting and how much she loved science experiments. The youngest was 5 and he was just starting to get out of his terrible little boy stage and was beginning to be really sweet again. He loved skateboarding and super heros and he had the most gorgeous blue eyes with blonde hair. I've been a fucking wreck since i found out they were gone. I care about maybe 5 people in my family and the 3 purest ones are gone.\n\nThis just further proves to me that gods not real because what the fuck kind of god takes a woman who was the embodiment of what he supposedly preaches and two beautiful children. What \"diving purpose\" does it serve to take away my cousin's mother and both of her children in the same day?..... but at the same time how am i supposed to be comforted be the fact that a wonderful little boy only got to exist for 5 years? How do i move past this without that same comfort that everyone else has, that they're still there in a way and that I'll see them again? I consider myself more agnostic in that I'm open to the idea of a higher being but no religion has proven to me that theirs is right. So i hope that theres some sort of afterlife. I know that if there is a heaven they have to be there. \n\nI'm sorry for the rambling and wall of text. I really just wanted to get all of this out. I feel like now is definitely not the time to tell my family i don't believe in the one thing thats keeping them from falling apart, but in the mean time I'm falling apart.",

So that sounds like an awesome afterlife right? I understand that death is always a sad thing but wouldn't you be more happy for the dead person than sad? It seems to me that even with so much faith, they still for the most part are very unsure about this promise from the Bible. If you question the Bible's validity they have conniption fits and start reading bible verses till your ears bleed like it's damn stigmata. But when one of them dies there's this overwhelming doubt that hits all of them and how could it not? So I'm just saying that seeing how they react even though such a transition should bring more happiness than anything had made clear to me how little faith they have. Of course it will be later shaken off as a \"test from the lord\" who does everything out of love. \n",

        "text": "First, a little about me. I am an 18-year-old college student studying Computer Science. Both of my parents are hardcore Christians. My dad has been a missionary and a pastor for 20+ years and he would take me on missions trips when I was little. My mom is also a hardcore Christian although she works in the insurance industry. I have been going to church literally my whole life and i even went to a private Christian school. I love both of my parents to death. They are great people and have \"blessed\" me with so much that I would never take for granted.\n \nSo, as you have noticed by reading the title of the post, I have a bit of a predicament. I am a recently converted Atheist and am getting really tired of being forced to go to church every Sunday and Wednesday. Being dragged to church makes me more and more resistant to it. I tried to really commit to \"God\" for a while but nothing changed in me. If anything, I became more resilient and eventually just decided to not believe in any God and I have felt much more liberated that i have in my previous 18 years of life. I do not pray anymore or ask God for help. However, this becomes a little difficult at church. I am known by every church member and help my Dad out when he's praying for people etc. I am scared of what everyone might think of me and I know for a fact that they are all going to want to pray for me. I do not want their prayer but i also do not want to make my parents look bad in front of the Church unless they decide to keep this issue to themselves (they are close to a lot of the church members). So do I just fake it till I make it? \"Make it\" being the moment I come out and tell my parents. I am just really confused right now and have no idea what to do. \n\nI have come really close to telling my parents. However, I think I should wait. I am going to be transferring to another college away from home after my sophomore year. (I'm currently in my second semester of my freshman year). I was thinking I could tell them right before I head off to college. I just don't know if I can wait that long as that is quite a bit of church services and prayers.\n\nBasically, I'm just looking for any advice concerning my situation. I would also really enjoy reading about anyone else who has been in a similar situation and what you did to confront it. \n",

Since extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and the theist has the burden of faith, (s)he has a tall mountain to climb in order to convince us that a god exists. \n\nBut I was wondering two things and I'd like your guys' opinion on it: \n\n1) Why is it not a fallacy for us to demand evidence manifested in natural causes / the phenomenal realm? Why can the theist not argue: \"Since we inquire into a supernatural being, it would make sense it has mostly supernatural evidence and no natural traces/clues.\" \n\n2) At the moment we are not aware of any evidence that gives reasonable doubt to the existence of a god. But can there be any natural evidence for a god at all? What (hypothetical) evidence could constitute a convincing clue for god? Or is this a contradictio in terminis?\n\nI think especially the second question might be of interest to people who identify as gnostic atheists.\n\nI look forward to your answers :)",

How valid is this argument? Did he really \"fulfill\" these prophecies? Were there many prophecies that he didn't fulfill?\n\nThey also claim that since the New Testament has a very high number of manuscripts, it must be very reliable and close to the original, and therefore all the gospels that detail Jesus's life are historically accurate. Is this also valid? How do we know if the original was accurate? Are there non-biblical sources that could back up any of the events in the New Testament, like Jesus performing miracles such as bringing people back from the dead and healing diseases? How accurate are the bible's accounts of Jesus's resurrection?\n\nThanks all, and have a good day!",

However, after dealing with doubt and doing my best to follow my conscience and the truth to wherever it led, I have become an atheist. But, I still pretend to believe and still carry out all of these leadership positions. I have informed my mother of my doubts, she is accepting and understanding, but she wants me to fake belief and continue going through the motions. My peers tell me I'm an \"inspiration\" but that's largely because I conform to the Christian standards of godliness such as reading the Bible cover-to-cover each year, going to church, not drinking or having sex, etc. My mother is worried I will hurt the peers who look up to me because of my faith. As a result, I have reached a dilemma. I want to live with integrity and tell the truth about what I believe. I feel immensely guilty every time I teach a lesson or plan an FCA meeting or \"worship\" in church on Sunday. However, I don't want to harm the people I care about and the people who look up to me because of the faith I used to have. I feel more and more like a coward the longer I fake faith. But, I want to minimize the damage that may come as much as possible. Any advice/feedback would be appreciated. Thank you for reading. ",

        "text": "I used to believe in God. To me, there was always something beyond our reality, beyond what we could understand. I felt that something far greater than myself was actively at work in the world. That we are all cogs in God’s magnificent machine; all parts of God’s plan. I had a certain hope. I knew that there would always be someone to look after me. I knew that there was someone in control. I knew that God had put me on this Earth for a reason and that he had a great plan for my life. I knew that I could do anything if I was with God. I knew that when I died, I would see my friends and family again.\nWhen I had my faith, I felt like I was flying. My body would get tired; but my soul would be on fire. \n\nWhen we say “God is dead”, it’s usually triumphant. Celebratory. As though we’ve vanquished him through some great victory. But when I found myself saying it, it wasn’t like that at all. I said it as though I was in mourning. As though I had lost someone dear to me. It’s not something you can easily describe to people. You only know what it’s like if you’ve felt it. It’s like losing someone close to you. You’re just…empty. Your whole foundation, what you’ve built up your life and world around – washed away like a castle in the tide. A lot of people who were indoctrinated as a child felt glad to be finally be free of God. But I didn't.\n\nOver the span of a few days, the creeping doubts and thoughts which I’d tried to repress sprang to the surface. I don’t remember where they came from. But there came a point where they all tumbled out and formed a terrible jigsaw. Different bits of knowledge and ideas which I’d picked up here and there all came together. I realised that I had dedicated myself to a glorious mistake. A beautiful lie. All my praying, reading, thinking – for nothing.\n\nI don’t think many people realise just how terrifying and lonely that moment is. When this started, I prayed and asked for a sign, in the vain hope that I was not waylaid. But none came. I wanted something – anything – which could help me believe again. But there was only silence. I felt myself slipping irrevocably into the chasm of unbelief. \n\nThe more I fell into this cloud of unknowing, the more I despaired. Have you ever felt your whole world collapse before your very eyes? The thing which I had dedicated so much of my life and future to crumbled before me and I couldn’t do anything about it. \nEverything felt so terribly, terribly pointless. There was no purpose or meaning to my existence anymore. I was floating in a meaningless void. Everything felt pointless and life was just going through the motions, with no real idea what I was doing. Some people are liberated by the idea that they can choose and shape their own life meaning. But that’s not much help for me – someone who had shaped their entire life around something that was no longer there. Every time I tried to discover or create a new meaning for myself, it just felt like I was trying to distract myself from my existential dread. \nI was terrified. The idea that we are just one huge cosmic accident, insignificant in the universe and with laughably deluded self-importance – it was frightening. A large part of me which had believed in the invisible guiding hand of the universe was now naked and afraid. I felt empty. I felt betrayed. I now realised that there wasn’t any grand plan. Things didn’t happen for a reason, engineered by the mind of God. That I wasn’t placed upon the Earth for a specific reason, that Providence wasn’t at work in the world.That the world really was as chaotic and evil as we secretly, fearfully thought.\n\nI thought about death a lot. At night, I’d lie awake trying to imagine what it was like to be dead. It’s not darkness, or blackness, because you have nothing to experience that with. You simply…cease to be. Can you imagine that? What it’s like to not exist? It frightened the hell out of me at first. But, come to think of it, the idea of living for eternity scares me just as much.\nI suppose I have a certain acceptance of my death. I mean, I can’t do much about it, can I? It’s one of those things that we’ve struggled with, ever since the beginning – the fact that you, everyone you know, everyone you love – will die. We’ve comforted ourselves with the idea that we’ll see our loved ones in the afterlife. But to the extent of my knowledge, this is just another beautiful little lie. Once we die, it’s over. Lights out. The end. It’s terrifying. Life is so fragile. We’re just transient little blips. We have to be grateful for every single day that we’re alive, and every single day that we have the ones we love. Because you never know the last time you’ll see them. \n\nAs odd as it sounds, I wished I was a blissful ignorant. That I didn’t know all the stuff I did and that I could live my life believing in God and taking strength and comfort from my faith. Most people, when asked between the choice of the red or the blue pill, would choose the red. But I would take the blue. I won’t lie – though I know I should take the red, the truth, I would rather believe a glorious lie and live in peace, than have the truth and spend my time alone and in turmoil. What can I say? The flesh is weak.\n\n- - -\n\nI wrote that sometime in January, and I'm glad to say that now I have found meaning. I have gained an interest in science and the cosmos, and my position in the universe is now comforting, not terrifying. I thought I'd share all of this with you because we tend to forget that losing your faith can sometimes be a truly depressing experience. But now I'm glad that I no longer believe in God.",

Do you really need an ironclad specific definition to think of stuff that might look like a God to you?\n\nI'm an atheist and here's my answer: A booming voice heard throughout the world in all languages tells everyone that it is God, and to prove it, it raises the entirety of Mount everest from its foundation and writes, \"I'm totally real, check out this message\" in the sky with all of the pieces of the mountain. Then that God lets everyone confirm that the message is real, and actually just magically floating there, and no one is hallucinating.\n\nThen it writes messages with stars from our galactic neighborhood, gives the ability to talk to all dogs, and cures aging and disease all over the world instantly, with amputees spontaneously growing limbs. With personalized daily vocal and visual reminders that it is real. Continuing for the rest of human existence.\n\nI'd think that was a God. \n\nYou won't win any sympathy by being so damn argumentative.\n\nEDIT: I knew I would regret that capital G in 'God', since a few of you took that to mean the Christian God.

Tons of special pleading, appealing to authority(Check out this really smart professor who converted to my religion He was an atheist too!\") and more fallacious arguments.\n\nI don't want to be convinced into worshiping. That's just not my shtick. But I would like to hear a good solid argument for a case for god. Even if I don't believe in one, but I never have heard of a good one. ",

Coal, from what I was reading, started forming over 300 million years ago and is the result of tremendous heat and pressure on peat.  300 million years.... in a state where they give tax credits to a museum espousing a 5000 year old earth view and want to make the bible the official state book.\n\nSimilarly - oil - and when I think oil I think Texas - is a 'fossil' fuel.  A non-renewable resource that formed roughly 370 million  years ago.  The other thing I think of when I think Texas is fundamentalism.  Again - a world view with a young earth creation bent.\n\nMade me laugh that in two of the states where religion is most prevalent and fundamental their economies are firmly built on resources whose origins run 180 degrees in contradiction to the beliefs of those harvesting and benefitting from them.\n\n",

I could most comfortably see the sunset when I couldn't see the sun.\n\nIt got me thinking about possible justifications for God to \"be hidden\" such that most people aren't sure whether God exists or not. I think most Christians are \"agnostic Christians\": They haven't experienced a miracle or private revelation. They don't *know* that God exists. ('know' = true, justified, certain belief) Likewise, atheists don't have proof that God doesn't exist. It seems to me agnosticism is 'the baseline', both sides having arguments in their favor but with an incomplete understanding of reality.\n\nAs it currently stands -- it not being clear whether God exists -- we are free to live our lives as we see fit. According to the Catholic Church, this life is our formative period, our spiritual womb, where our choices shape our will and our personality, before we're born to eternal life: Like driving on the highway with no cop in sight, we can choose to go the speed limit or speed.\n\nIf God's existence were obvious, would it not radically alter our freedom and the power of our actions? It seems our lives would be reduced to something like a football game with God as constant referee; we couldn't \"steal from the cookie jar\" because God would obviously be right there watching us; instead of expecting God to ultimately serve justice at the end (i.e. when we're born to eternal life at the General Judgment), we should expect God to right every problem *now*, ruining our character formation.\n\n**So is it not better for society that God be hidden? If not, why not?**\n\nTo address a possible objection:\n\n\"Less people would go to hell if God were obvious.\" We don't know how many people actually go to hell, and the Catholic Church teaches that God doesn't punish people for what they don't know.",

        "text": "Hello everyone,   \n\nThe majority of atheists on discussion boards like reddit, and famous atheist youtubers that I often come across, hold the agnostic atheist position. This seems to be the standard position that a rational person should hold.  \n\nI've seen people who hold a harder atheist stance (gnostic) being bashed by agnostic atheists as being \"irrational, committing the same mistake as religious people\", i.e belief without evidence, blind faith, which is against the concept of skepticism and science. (Not mentioning they get even more hate from the religious people).   \n\nLet's discuss whether this is really an irrational position, and the arguments that are often made against the gnostic position. I'll try to play the devil advocate here.  \n\n**1/\"You can't know anything for certain**. Skepticism is the basic of science\".  \nThis argument says that gnostic position claims to know things for certain, but there is nothing that could be known for certain. Therefore we should refrain from making such claims.  \n  \n**Skepticism is necessary to a certain degree, however not in every cases and over everything**. Like for instant, I don't think anyone is trying to question or disprove Pythagoras theorem (duh).   \nTo claim nothing is certain is also incorrect, **we do know several things with the absolute of certainty.** I can list a few categories:   \n\na/ Logic.  \nA = B.  \nB = C.  \nTherefore, A = C.  \n\n\nb/ True by definition.   \nIf you add 1 to a integer, you get the next bigger integer.  \n2 is the next bigger integer that follow 1 in base 10   \nTherefore, 1+1=2 in base 10  \n\nc/ Some facts  \nNow a lot will disagree with me over this category, but I'll just list  examples of what I think is true with absolute certainty:  \nThe earth is a sphere.  \nI had a sandwich for breakfast today.  \n\nMy final point on this: **The whole argument \"You can't know anything for certain\" contradicts itself**. How are you 100% certain that \"You can't know anything for certain\"? I think the most correct way about this is to accept that there are things that are certain: \"You can know some things for certain and can't know some other things for certain\".  \n\n**2/ \"No evidence is not an evidence\"**  \nThis argument says that the gnostic position claims absence of evidence=evidence of absence, which is a fallacy.  \n\nI think we can agree that no evidence is not an evidence of absence. However there is a few point I want to make here:  \n\na/ The flying spaghetti monster  \nI think we're all familiar with the flying spaghetti monster argument, initially created to make the point that religious people cannot disprove him, to prove how crazy the idea of believing in something without evidence is.  \nDid it strike you that if you are certain that the flying spaghetti monster does not exist (because it was made up in the first place), you can be certain the God can not exist, with the same reasoning?  \nIf you tell me you are actually agnostic about the flying spaghetti monster, believe we should be skeptic about it, sorry but I will be more likely to have a good laugh.  \n\nb/ Evidence against God.  \nI would argue that gnostic atheist does not claim absence of evidence as equal to evidence of absence. Instead, the gnostic postion is held because of the **overwhelming evidence against God**. Not just the evolutionary evidence, but also philosophical evidence (if God made us then who made him, etc). And when two claims are contradictory, you know that the Earth cannot be 6000 years old and 4.5 billion years old at the same time. And gnostic just happen to pick the one that are proven, tested and reviewed. Essentially, I'm gnostic that the Earth is not 6000 years old, and agnostic (skeptic) that the Earth is 4.5 billion years old. You can be gnostic against religion and still agnostic (skeptic) towards science. Who say gnostic atheist is gnostic about everything else?\n\n**3/ Your definition of \"God\"**?  \n\nBefore asking me what kind of atheist I am, let me ask you about your definition of God. **If by God you mean if God of a specific religion exists (God of the Bible, or the Quran, etc), I can say that I'm gnostic against that God**, because of the sheer contradictory, bad historical evidence and outright cruelty, false morality, etc..within their own holy scripture.  \n\nThe only concept of God that I can give an \"agnostic\" pass is a God that have no contradictory to our scientific knowledge. The most plausible God is the God who created the universe then went hiding somewhere else, letting everything evolving on its own (you can say he makes the Big Bang), not the God of morality, not the God who create Earth and human, and certainly not the God who answers prayers and punishes sins.    \n\nSorry for the long post. Disclaimer: I'm not a gnostic atheist, but I think I'm always open minded on the discussion of everything, even on the concept of atheism, and we all should do.",

        "text": "Hello all,\n\nAfter a long time of research and study, this is what I have come to believe when it comes to faith, gods and religion. \n\nI belive either one of these two statements is true. \n\n1) There is no such thing as higher power/s or deity/ies or divine force/s. This is the standard definition of an atheist. \n\n2) There is a possibility that higher power/s, deity/ies, divine force/s exist, but if they do or ever did, they would not give a damn about us. \n\nTo me, the notion that the creator/s of reality care about the everyday happenings of human apes (they care about what we eat, how we have sex, our clothing, etc) and that they demand humans to perform activities such as reads ancient fictional books or praying facing a certain direction or praying for certain amount of times a day or chanting certain phrases in return for acceptance is just incredibly silly. \n\nA brief study of astronomy would reveal that the universe is incredibly vast and complex. You think praying 5 times a day facing the direction of a meteorite rock or going to a special building in Sunday to read a book or showing fire to statues or burning incense is going to get this supposed creator to take notice of you and grant you or desires - Especially when there's an entire universe (and possibly multiverse) to manage ? You might as well appreciate their supposed existence and graciousness while talking a walk or taking a dump or masturbating or drinking beer - They will hear you out because of their supposed omnipresence and omniscience. Also, having sex and consuming alcohol is a lot more interesting as a praying method. \n\nThe conclusion I can make from these two statements is that I am indifferent towards the possibility of the existence of god/s (Some religious people have asked me how I would react if I came face to face with a god to which I said I would tell god that god has better things and more important things to do than supervising my life in minute detail - Essentially, leave me be, go manage reality) but I find organized religion to be something that is truly silly. The thing is, I don't know if there is a term to describe all this - Because it takes quite a while to explain this someone if they ask me what I believe in. Is this agnosticism ? Or apatheism ? Or deism ? Or something else ?\n\nThanks.",

        "text": "Hey everyone. I've been think about this for sometime and I wanted to bounce this thought off of some intelligent people before I use it and make a fool of myself. I know it may be technically possible that a god or any one god may exist but I've been pondering how incredibly low the probability of it is. Both we and most theists admit that it is impossible for us to put up a test that can verify or falsify the existence of any one god or that there is even a god at all. Given that we have no usable data I wonder if we can consider the probability of any one god existing to be a function of 1/x where x is the total number of unfalsifiable possible causes of the universe. I think it is reasonable to consider the number of possible unfalsifiable causes of the universe to be infinite. For example, it is possible that a god with 3 fingers created the universe and it's also possible that he will only send people to heaven if they believe he has only three fingers. Since there is an infinite amount of numbers there could be an infinite number of possible gods with a different numbers  of fingers. So without data that would help us narrow the search down, the chances of a god or any one particular god existing is 1 chance in infinity. \n\nIn calculus they look at limits of values as they approach infinity. One chance in infinity is not a zero percent chance but the limit of 1/x as x--&gt; infinity does equal zero. So although we can't say there is a zero percent chance that god or any one god is real, it is reasonable to treat the probability that god exists as the limit of 1/x as x--&gt; infinity, which does equal zero. \n\nIf we can look at it this way it may still not be reasonable to positively say there is no god but just as in calculus we treat 1/x like zero by taking the limit as x approaches infinity, it is reasonable to treat the probability of a god being real to be zero. Could this be a justification for some kind of semi-strong atheism where we say god is possible but the chances are infinitesimally small and might as well be zero. \n\nTell me what you think. I'm not afraid of criticism. I appreciate feedback and have an open mind. \n\n",

This group keeps on asking if I believe in anything at all - they are very quick to say \"of course rituals and other things are silly, but you believe in god, right? Then the soul? How can't you believe in those?\" Basically they hit a wall here. They can't seem to process my non-belief. \n\n2. The second group basically responds by saying that they 'feel' there is some mystical universal force at work which we can't discern and therefore can't deny. \n\nI was wondering, how does my experience compare to the daily experiences of atheists in other areas? Also how do you act in these situations? I always try to be very calm, polite and logical. And I never debate unless asked. ",

It's more than a belief you hold that others simply acknowledge, and they let you live your life however you want; unfortunately, it's a way of life where I'm from.\n\nMy parents are convinced that if their kids turn non-Muslim - and God forbid, an *atheist* - they will go to hell no matter how hard they try to redeem theirselves. They're good people with a sense of duty aside from the occasional crazy 'logic' that comes with being hell-religious. I know that when I come out to them they'd eventually accept me, but I'll be breaking their hearts. Unfortunately keeping up the charade is not an option for much longer as I can't keep up with the obligations that come with being Muslim (praying five times a day, fasting, going on pilgrimage).\n\nSo I want to find a way to reassure them that 1) it's not their fault at all that I'm not Muslim (not even close to a lack of education about Islam); 2) atheists can be good people too; and 3) \"if God is all-forgiving, he'd understand it's not your fault and you won't be going to hell.\" It would be especially handy if anyone can link me to Qur'an verses that can help them reconcile my atheism with their beliefs, like what this guy did [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/lvbcc/advice_for_telling_parents_from_a_christian/) with bible verses.\n\nAnyone have any experiences, suggestion, advice?

        "text": "Back in the day, I was ushered into secularism from fundamental Christianity by the likes of Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, etc. I was moved by their arguments, but I eventually came to realize something else about the crowd of people who follow these guys. \n\nThe other day, I was watching a Q&amp;A of sorts with Dawkins and Harris. It was about an hour and a half long, give or take, but I swear that like half of it was taken up by audience applause. Not that the talk was that profound, it's just that these people would clap at anything. Any statement that these men have already made a million times before for some reason warranted a 10 second round of applause. For me, it almost became a game of anticipation and guessing when I would have to wait for the audience to start clapping. \n\nMoreover, when I'm on YouTube, I'll occasionally get talks and the like from the aforementioned speakers. About half the time, it's some cringey, click bait title like \"Christopher Hitchens SLAMS the Christians!!!\" It bugs me to no end, and I'm sure there is no shortage of people who use this as reassurance that atheists are arrogant douche bags and that the movement is led by a bunch of snooty man-children. I can't really say I blame them. I'm a little embarrassed to say that this is the most prominent force for secularism right now, and it's being led by a bunch of fan boys who almost treat it like a sporting event.\n\nEdit: Many of you have defended those cheering in the crowds. I have to admit, it probably isn't the best example of what I'm trying to get across. I understand their sentiments, but it was bordering on cartoonish how often these people interrupted Harris or Dawkins to applaud. The reason I included it to get my point across is that to me, it's approaching \"fan boyism,\" which I think is inherently contradictory to secularism. If we as secularists want to stand up against dogmatism, I think we ought to practice more sobriety so that we don't become dogmatic ourselves. ",

If you want to know the philosophy, epistemology, biology, cosmology, or neuroscience of a topic, just ask.  These are important, and in some cases, very difficult questions.  The person, the source of them, has little to no meaning in such a context.\n\nSecondly, most of us no longer believe because we've seen the religious answers for the lies and uninformed falsehoods that they are.  For many of us, it really, really bothered us to be lied to like that, myself included.\n\nSo, if you have a question, from yourself or someone else, just state the question without preamble.\n\nExamples:\n\n* \"What happens after someone dies?\"\n* \"What is the meaning of life, and stop answering 42!\"\n* \"What the heck is up with all these teapots?!?\"\n* \"Did Eli Bosnick really lick Ray Comfort?\"\n\nAnd, for the answers:\n\n* Nuthin'.\n* 42.\n* Let me tell you about Jibbers Crabst next!\n* Yes, yes he did.\n\nJust because we no longer have time for religion, and because some of us get a touch mad about 'pass the buck' questioning, doesn't mean we're incapable of having fun :)",

        "text": "I recently posted about this on my facebook, and was curious to know what you all think:\n\nSo tomorrow is \"Hijab Day,\" where certain people plan to wear the Hijab in solidarity with Muslims and to reduce stigma of the garment, while other people view it as a problematic symbol at best, and not one they encourage non-Muslim women to adopt in \"solidarity.\"\n\nBecause alienating allies (and fear of being alienated) is a significant issue that liberals tend to have, I think this is a legitimate point where people can not know what the right answer is. I don't claim to be an authority on Islam, not being at any point Muslim myself, or women's rights, for a similar reason.\n\nBut I will say that there should be ways to stand in solidarity with Muslims facing discrimination, without supporting symbols of Islamic oppression. My parents came to this country from Iran, where to this day the theocratic dictatorship still mandates that all women in public wear a head covering, regardless of their nationality or faith.\n\nI tend to be anti-theistic in general, and often struggle with my desire to call out Islam for its oppressive practices and beliefs while distancing myself from Islamophobic rhetoric that attacks Muslims as people. I know other liberals who feel similarly. I don't want to dissuade anyone that was planning for sure to participate in Hijab Day, but I do want to make sure people who might be on the fence know that it's okay to be, and not to feel pressured to if you're torn on the issue.\n\nA couple articles that go into it more:\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/12/21/as-muslim-women-we-actually-ask-you-not-to-wear-the-hijab-in-the-name-of-interfaith-solidarity/\n\nhttps://theestablishment.co/wearing-a-hijab-isnt-the-way-you-should-show-support-for-muslim-women-today-or-ever-15ca055d866d#.eqd1q3jh1",

        "text": "My roommate is very religious and the concept of someone not believing in God is very foreign to her even after I tried my hardest to explain it simply. I'm not atheist either (Not as religious as she is though), so I am not as good as explaining it since I don't have the perspective. So what she wants to ask is....How do you have a purpose in life if you don't believe in God? What's the point of you being here then? How can you believe in other things or anything, but view God as an abstract or not real? She does not want you to answer \"science\" because she says science cannot explain everything. She wants an answer that doesn't involve science I guess. It's apparent she has not grown up around a lot of atheists, while like 75-80% of my friends from school were atheists or just not religious when I was living in my hometown in Ohio (In the south for college now), so her questions might sound a little sheltered to you. Please be gentle. She is a really nice girl and she does not mean any harm with these questions. That's why I went here instead of r/atheism. She is just curious. I would appreciate some insight for her. Maybe y'all can help her think by asking her some similar questions back if you want.\n\n\nEdit: 1:14am Thanks for your answers so far. She wanted to see how y'all thought and now she has a better understanding already. She has some disagreements to these responses, but I can't write them here because she doesn't want me to (Lol). So just PM me if you are curious. I will still read future responses to her as she wants to hear them.\n\nEdit 2: Wow! She will suprised at the amount of reponses. Thanks guys. The more answers, the more diversity in opinion.\n\nEdit 3: Breaking her wishes, but basically she said a lot of your responses regarding a purpose sounds like, \"Moralism\".\n\nEdit 4: This is what she said. This is only for some of the answers I guess because she feels they perceived it wrong.\n\n\"Firstly, I am not religious (Yes you are...lol) nor I am trying to make a point politically. I am not by any means trying to guide my questions to a receive a certain answer (ex. saying you can't answer science). I will admit that the questions I have originally asked were worded incorrectly and therefore, have caused some unease. What I am trying to understand is your beliefs/viewpoints on life. Do you believe you have a purpose in life and how do you believe it came to be? How do you perceive abstract concepts such as love and faith? Are you moralists? Please don't take the questions as an offensive!\"\n\nPersonally, I thought most of these answers were sufficient and well thought out, but for some reason some of them are not enough for her, so she wants me to put what she wrote above here cause she thinks some y'all didn't understand what she meant.\n\nEdit 5: I will read to her the new responses later and tell you what she said.\n\nEdit 6: This is will be my last edit. Thank you to everybody who answered all of her questions. These were some very thoughtful answers and I appreciate this nice discussion here. She was happy to be exposed to this new viewpoint and she understands much more.",
