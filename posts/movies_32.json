        "text": " \n\n* Luke was a complete waste. He was doesn't get to kill Vader or Emperor or Jabba or Boba Fett. He is supposed to be the hero of this trilogy.\n* The Emperor dies by falling down a well after someone sneaks up behind him? You know the ruler of the universe, the ultimate threat in the galaxy and the driving villain of the trilogy and this is how the writers have him killed? Also with no backstory. What about the various fan theories I came up with?\n* Why would the Head of State of THE GALACTIC EMPIRE have an open pit leading straight to the Reactor RIGHT in the middle of his throne room? That'd be like having a massive open pit leading all the way down to the core of the Earth in the Oval Office. This is RIDICULOUS!\n* Laws of Physics like Newton's Laws of motion, Newton's Gravitation laws, Conservation of momentum aren't followed in any of the films. There's no sound in space so why do we keep hearing explosions? All the planets conveniently have the same gravity and breathable atmosphere even for different species?\n* To travel from Earth to nearest Star System Alpha Centauri A it would take a few years at lightspeed. But in this universe it takes just a couple of seconds?\n* So Leia always knew somehow that Luke was her brother? Then why’d she make out with him in front of her future love interest? And we’re just supposed to just forget that in the next couple of scenes. SCREEN WRITING 101!\n* Another Death Star in RoTJ? Why did they repeat a major plot point of A New Hope? So lazy of the writers. I REALLY hope that there are no death stars in the future films. Excited to watch TFA today.\n* Why did the empire only unleash a half a dozen tie fighters during the x-wing raid? It's moon sized space station stockpiled with weaponry and vehicles, why didn't they just release a armada and carpet bombed the shit out of yavin 4 instead approaching it at a snails pace?\n* Who are hans parents? Who are Chewbacca’s parents? Who are yoda's parents? Who is the emporers parents? Who are Vader’s parents? Who are tarkins parents? Who are landos parents? Who is boba fetts parents? Who is wickets parents? Who are Java’s parents? Who are admiral ackbars parents? Who are wedges parents? Who are obi wans parents? Who are greedos parents? Who are Mom Mothmas parents? Surely they are all tied to someone else in the films right?\n* The highly trained, advanced, technologically superior and experienced army of the Galactic Empire gets defeated by a bunch of cute teddy bears? I get what George was going for with this(primitive culture defeating an advanced army trope) but it's too much.",

And I mean, from the beginning to the end it seems almost everyone is drinking. Not just in their free time, not just at a bar or restaurant, but it seemed like all the time. In the Russia scenes, the UK scenes, the USA scenes. And not just the same people drinking, it was quite a bit of the cast, and almost constantly.\n\nI always thought movies set and/or made in the 20's to the 70's were the booziest, or maybe movies where alcohol consumption are part of the story line like Barfly. Now, I think \"The Russia House\" may be the booziest movie of all time.\n\nThoughts anyone? What's the booziest movie of all time? Has anyone else seen this movie, what where your thoughts of the movie overall?

When the trailer first aired in 98’ showing the ‘rain shootout scene’ I knew it was a must see. This is definitely a movie where all the characters felt like a family, and has all the ingredients of a “Golden-Era” movie.",

        "text": "So, I'm 100% sure that I saw a movie in my childhood and I was utterly obsessed with it. However, apparently no one has ever heard of this movie and not even my mom remembers it (which is weird, because I was a little kid at the time and she normally remembers everything I saw when I was a kid). So now I'm questioning my own memory and I need to know if a movie with the elements below exists or if it was just a very creative fruit of my imagination:  \n\n\n\\- The movie was centered around a species that had some powers which they activated through whistles. Because of that, it was essential that everyone knew how to whistle. It was an animal-like species and the two main characters, a boy and a girl, belonged to that species (the girl being a pink one and the boy being an orange one)  \n\n\n\\- The boy didn't know how to whisper, though, and it was essential for some reason that he learned how to do it. That was part of the main plot.  \n\n\n\\- One of the other parts of the main plot was that they needed to protect something (I guess it was an egg) from the villain, which was a guy that had a goofy sidekick (which I THINK was like a little ball creature or something) and wore a black toppat (he was also not human btw). The MCs needed to take it somewhere to hatch safely (and the egg hatching had something to do with the boy learning how to whistle).  \n\n\n\\- In the end, the orange boy does learn how to whistle and the egg hatches. Then the final song of the movie (yes, it had songs) starts and at some point it's shown that the villain's blimp actually fell from the sky and him and his sidekick ended up in a desert. At this point they sing a verse of the song saying that even if their plan had gone wrong they're never leaving each other's side and etc.\n\n\\- It was a pretty colorful movie also.  \n\n\nThose are literally the only things I can remember. If someone has ever heard about this or at least has a guess, please let me know, I'm desperate for an answer as I am now questioning how many people in the world (if it even existed) saw this movie.",

Epic, yet still very personal. \n\n2) The Banshees of Inisherin\nBest ensemble acting and story best described Ireland’s attitude about itself. \n\n3) Top Gun Maverick\nBest popcorn movie and Tom Cruise sold his aging persona. Movie I’ll probably most watch several times in future. \n\n4) Avatar: The Way of Water\nA total spectacle and some of the best action sequences of the year. It was also too long. \n\n5) Tar\nBest individual acting of year by Cate Blanchet. \n\n6) Women Talking\nGood, but less talking and more doing would have been better. \n\n7) Everything Everywhere All at Once\nI didn’t get it. Very schizophrenic. \n\n8.) Elvis\nMore a series of vignettes than a cohesive story. Tom Hanks?\n\n9) Fablemans\nSeemed more contrived than sincere. \n\n10) Triangle of Sadness \nNot one of ten best pictures of year. Movie couldn’t end soon enough for me. \n\n1 - 4 pretty set in stone and all very good. 5 - 8 could go in any order.",

I loved Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan and The Wrestler, but even the lesser acclaimed The Fountain. (His first movie though, Pi, was definitely not for me, but I think he was still just experimenting there.)\n\nAnyway, today I watched The Whale and I can't really put it anywhere. His signature was all over it, it was definitely a very Aronofsky movie, which I have loved so far. And The Whale was good but to my surprise I wasn't as crazy about it as about the rest of his movies. Maybe it was just my mood today and the cinema experience, or maybe it was actually not as good as the rest... I really can't put this anywhere. Everything about the movie tells me that I should have absolutely loved it, but I don't think I did. So what did you think? I'm specifically curious about other Aronofsky fans' opinions, please, PLEASE spare me the Brendan Frasure comments. Yes he is great, but this post is not about his comeback.\n\nP.S: I was definitely missing Clint Mansell, that I am sure of at least.",

Now, I watched \"Elvis\" and the pace of the movie is quite slow and it doesn't help to keep the person interested. Beside they missed a big part of his life, the drug addict, fat Elvis. Austin Butler is the only thing that keep you hang in the movie but for me and this is just critic without any fundament, didn't see in Butler a great acting, just in the part where he is singing on a TV studio. I didn't include the others cause I haven't watch them.\nWhat do you think? This is my honest and humble appreciation",

(This is obviously super subjective, and my own opinion. Also, exceptions exist on both sides, of course, notably Evanna Lynch's Luna Lovegood and Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall I thought were great). \n\nI hadn't watched the series in a long time. I've been on a kick of \"GrOwN uP\" movies so maybe the transition back to something made for children and adults alike got me tripped up. Overall I found the performances from the adults way over the top and distracting. \n\nI realize my snobbery is getting away from just enjoying the movie for what they are. But, I'm also interested to know people's thoughts on the acting in the series.",

She has very little experience with Star Trek history, but the movie has such a solid plot and great storytelling that any knowledge about Kirk, Spock, et. al. is merely icing on the cake.    What really stood out to both of us were the spot-on acting decisions by some of the legendary cast including Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub, and Sam Rockwell.   The story makes a grand arc with clever plot twists and a satisfying classic finish, back at the start never to be the same.   Even through I had seen it plenty of times, I still laughed, still cried.    \n\nFor an extra treat, search for the cut scenes on YouTube.  They are quite good and I'm surprised they didn't make it into a film with such a short run time.   \n\nFavorite quote:  \"That was a hell of a thing.\"",
