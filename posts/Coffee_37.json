I do place some importance on the looks, but the main thing is that it’s appropriate for espresso. Bonus if it’s not a huge drag to clean up. Would you recommend one of these three or something else?

        "text": "I recently bought a bag of washed, light roasted columbian beans in a bag boasting flavors of apricot, mango and peach. I've been to this specific roaster before and have had great results with their light roasts, reliably getting the notes they put on their bags, but not this time.\n\nThe coffee tastes acidic, there is not much in terms of roast flavor as one would expect, but also not much else. I've tried brewing it at the roaster recommended 95°C, I've varied my grind sizes, I've ventured above and below with temps, getting up to boiling and down to 85°C, but apart from introducing some bitterness and muddiness when going finer, nothing much has changed.\n\nI use an aeropress, a Kinu M47 Phoenix grinder, soft water that works great with other beans, and a 60g/l ratio of coffee to water. Maybe someone in this community has an idea what I could try to further troubleshoot this coffee, because I really want those fruity notes. I would be very grateful if anyone has an idea or two.",

Is it worth it in 2023?\n\nI want to use it mainly on the weekdays so I do not need to take as much time and prepare at least two (good!) cups of coffee so I can continue working without having to prepare myself a cup each time.\n\nI just want a \\*really\\* good cup of coffee and a workhorse machine without having to be really involved with it. On the weekends I can prepare other methods with more time.",

We have tried grinds 7- 15 usually about 18-19 grams and just cannot get a good shot. We maybe get half of the shot to actually come through. The rest just sits on top of the portafilter and gets pushed into the waste tray. When we buy pre ground espresso we can do 18-20 grams with no issues. Are we not grinding it fine enough or is it too fine? I keep finding conflicting things online.",
