I'm seriously struggling, and it's affecting me greatly. \n\nI recently realized how...bad things have gotten which was a huge eye opener for me and I really want to change but I'm unsure where to start. \n\n1. My health - I'm a super picky eater (specifically veggies), and although I'm not obese, I am overweight. I really want to get into shape and start taking care of myself, but I am struggling to stay motivated and to figure out how to help myself eat better. We're pretty sure my aversion to certain foods may be related to a certain possible diagnosis (work in progress) but I'm determined to make this work as much as possible. Would smoothies be a good option with fruit (love fruit)? Or new ways to put them in food? I have been trying to work out regularly but struggling because I get so tired after working 10hr shifts 5x a week. \n\n2. Money- I used to be very frugal with money and then it was legit like a switch was flicked on and now I feel like I'm awful at saving money and controlling my impulses. I would love tips on both of those things possible. \n\nAnd 3- My relationship. My partner recently let me know he feels that he puts in a lot more effort into our relationship when it comes to dates and it often feels one sided. I never realized I was doing this and it's certainly not something I want to continue. I am actively trying to plan more and be more present but I want to continue to be a better partner even beyond this. We've been together almost 6 years and he feels like this a long term issue. I want to make permanent, substantial change. \n\nBefore anyone asks, yes, I am seeing a therapist! But due to money and time, I don't get to see him as often as I'd like and we have lots of other issues we are working on. 60minuts isn't enough time to touch on everything apparently.",

My dream was a manifestation of a my newfound fear that I'll die old, lonely, unhappy, and broke. \n\n I've always believed that I could accomplish my goals, and by the time I was 30-35, I'd be a mother and wife with a fulfilling career and a good circle of friends.  However,  I'll be 30 this year, and I have no friends and no kids. I have a boyfriend and a decent job, but I'm not sure where either of those things are heading, and my job is not fulfilling.  I'm close to my family, but they have their own lives and their own circles. My younger siblings have a better social life than I do. \n\nIt's Super Bowl Sunday, and I'm at home alone. My siblings my age had plans that  they didn't invite me to. I had plans with my boyfriend, but he got too drunk with his friends, and I would've done the same if I had them. My mom invited me over, but I was too melancholy to go. \n\nI've given up on the idea of making friends, but I'd still like a stronger relationship and to still get married and have kids one day. However, I'd rather figure myself out and have a fulfilling career or multiple streams of income first. \n\nHowever, many thoughts and actions keep me stuck--the state of the world, other people have it worse, not believing in myself, low accountability, blaming the universe, putting my current job first and so on. The biggest  is that I talk a lot about what I will do, but then I don't. I let work consume me, even though I don't get paid enough to. Then, I stress about it, waste time, and go to bed. \n\nI understand we can change at any point in our lives, but I wasted most of my 20s on a toxic relationship. So, it feels like now or never.",

        "text": " Time management is an art that not everyone can master. It requires skill and discipline, but once you do it will be your best friend. With the proper use of this skill, you’ll find yourself getting more done in less time. You’ll also experience improved productivity, better work-life balance, and a general sense of control over your life. In this article, we’ll discuss why time management matters and how to develop the skills necessary for success.\n\nWe all have 24 hours in a day – how much of those precious hours are wasted? All too often, people feel like they never have enough time to finish their to-do lists or even relax and enjoy themselves. This can lead to stress and anxiety as deadlines approach faster than progress can be made. But what if there was a way to maximize our time so that every minute counts? That’s where learning effective time management techniques come into play!\n\nBy understanding the value of managing your time properly, you can begin making positive changes toward improving your overall well-being. Not only will it help boost efficiency at work, but it will also free up space in your personal schedule for activities that bring joy and happiness. So let’s explore some actionable strategies on how to get started with mastering the art of time management!\n\n### The Benefits Of Time Management\n\nTime management is an increasingly important skill for many of us in today’s world. According to a recent survey, the average person spends nearly 4 hours on their phone every single day. With this statistic in mind, it’s easy to see how beneficial time management can be.\n\nThe benefits of effective time management are far-reaching and wide-ranging. Firstly, by becoming better at managing our own time we become more organized and productive with both everyday tasks like grocery shopping or cleaning up around the house and also bigger projects such as work assignments or studying for exams. Additionally, having good strategies for utilizing our days efficiently leads to less stress during crunch times when there seems to be too much going on all at once. Lastly, making efficient use of our time allows us to make room for activities that help us relax and recharge such as exercising or reading a book — something that can have huge impacts on overall physical and mental health in the long run.\n\nImplementing these habits into practice requires understanding one’s needs and desires while still prioritizing productivity which will ultimately lead to greater success down the road.\n\n### Tips For Improving Time Management Skills\n\nTime management is a crucial skill for any successful person. One of the best ways to improve this ability is to practice and develop tips specifically tailored toward one’s own lifestyle. For example, one college student found success by setting aside 30 minutes every morning before class to plan their day and prioritize tasks. This routine allowed them to identify which activities were most important, allowing them to focus on those first while avoiding distractions that come with procrastination.\n\nIn addition, making lists can be extremely helpful in ensuring nothing gets forgotten or overlooked when trying to stay organized and productive. After jotting down all goals for the week ahead, it’s recommended to break bigger tasks into smaller chunks that are easier to tackle one at a time. Not only does this make completing each task feel more manageable; it also prevents feeling overwhelmed as well as helps keep the momentum going throughout the working process.\n\nTaking regular breaks from work is just as necessary as planning out what needs doing in order to maximize efficiency. Allowing yourself some downtime throughout the day will help you remain focused and energized during longer periods of concentration — leading to better quality results overall due to increased productivity levels! To further ensure total commitment towards accomplishing set objectives, creating rewards for oneself after crossing off items from a list can assist in staying motivated along your journey towards achieving self-improvement through improved time management skills. Without these simple but effective techniques, committing fully to managing time wisely may become much more difficult than it has to be!\n\n### Common Challenges In Time Management\n\nTime management is a skill that many of us struggle with, yet it’s absolutely essential to living an organized and productive life. Could there be something more than just lack of discipline behind our struggles? According to scientific research, the answer may very well be yes! Our brains are wired in such a way that certain tasks take longer to complete than others. This means that our natural inclination toward procrastination can’t always be attributed to laziness or lack of motivation – sometimes we’re simply working against our own biology.\n\nVarious external factors can also contribute to difficulties managing time effectively. Having too much on your plate at once often leads to feeling overwhelmed when trying to prioritize tasks, as does having too little information about what needs to be done and when it needs to be completed by. Additionally, attempting to multitask between different activities can lead us down a rabbit hole of distraction, where we end up spending far too long on one task while neglecting another altogether.\n\nNavigating these obstacles requires some effort – but with the right strategies, you’ll find yourself back on track before you know it.\n\n### Strategies For Overcoming Time Management Struggles\n\nTime management is a skill that many of us struggle with, but it doesn’t have to be. There are strategies available for overcoming the common challenges associated with managing your time wisely and effectively. The following are some tips for getting started:\n\nFirst, break down complex tasks into smaller chunks that you can tackle in manageable pieces over an extended period of time. This will help prevent procrastination from setting in as well as ensure that you’re making progress towards completing the task even if it takes longer than expected. Additionally, prioritize tasks based on their importance or urgency to make sure that more pressing matters get done first.\n\nSecond, create a timeline so that you know when deadlines are approaching and plan ahead accordingly. It’s also important to set realistic expectations and give yourself enough leeway should any unexpected situations arise. Finally, build in breaks throughout your day so that you don’t burn out or become overwhelmed by back-to-back activities. Breaks allow our minds and bodies to reset and refocus before moving onto the next item on our list.\n\nBy utilizing these strategies, we can start developing better habits surrounding our use of time and increase productivity overall. Without further ado, let’s take a look at some tools and resources available for time management success!\n\n### Tools And Resources For Time Management\n\nTime management is a challenge that many of us face daily. We all want to make the best use of our time but, more often than not, we find ourselves struggling to keep up with the tasks at hand. Finding effective tools and resources for time management can ensure that you are able to manage your day-to-day activities without feeling overwhelmed or stressed out.\n\nThe secret to successfully managing your time lies in having the right set of tools and resources at your disposal. But where do you start looking? Here are some helpful tips:\n\nStart by assessing how you currently spend your days – look closely at what takes up most of your time and consider if there’s anything you could be doing differently.  \nIdentify which areas need help when it comes to organization and efficiency – this will give you an idea of the type of tools and resources you should be looking for.  \nMake sure any tool or resource fits into your lifestyle – don’t try something new just because everyone else is using it!\n\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to finding the perfect tools and resources for time management; however, there are plenty of options available online that can help get you started on the road to success. Consider digital calendars, productivity apps such as Trello or Asana, task lists like Wunderlist or Todoist, scheduling software like Google Calendar, reminder services such as Slackbot or DoNotDisturbMe, habit-tracking apps like Momentum or HabitBull, goal-setting platforms such as GoalsOnTrack and much more! All these types of applications have been designed specifically with time management in mind so they’re great starting points if you’re looking for ways to better organize yourself.\n\nIt’s important to remember that while having access to useful tools and resources can certainly help improve overall productivity levels, ultimately it’s up to each individual person to decide how they use their own time effectively. With careful planning and commitment, anyone can become an expert in managing their own schedule —no matter how busy life gets!\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n\nTime management is like a game of tug-of-war. You’re constantly being pulled in every direction, and it’s up to you to decide which rope will pull the hardest. The goal is to balance your time so that you can be productive and accomplish what needs to be done without feeling exhausted or overwhelmed. It’s like walking a tightrope between two sides–the side of structure and discipline versus the side of flexibility and spontaneity.\n\nIt might sound daunting at first, but if you break down your tasks into manageable pieces, it becomes much easier to keep track of them all. Start by creating an organized list with everything that needs to get done that day. Prioritize items on the list from most important to least important, then set aside specific amounts of time for each task accordingly. Make sure you give yourself plenty of breaks throughout the day; these moments allow us to step back and take stock of our progress before we move onto the next item on our list.\n\nBy taking control over how we spend our days, weeks, and months, we can free ourselves from stress while still accomplishing great things! Having a plan helps make sense out of chaos – though sometimes life throws curveballs our way that require us to readjust our strategy — ultimately leading us closer to achieving our goals faster than ever before.\n\n### What Is The Best Way To Stay Motivated When It Comes To Managing Time?\n\nTime management skills can be like a maze: it’s easy to get lost, and if you don’t have the right tools, then it’s probably not worth trying. Staying motivated while managing time is one of the biggest challenges we face in life today. It requires discipline, focus, and an ability to prioritize tasks; but with the proper strategy and dedication, anyone can become a master at time management.\n\nGetting started on your journey toward mastering time management starts with breaking down large projects into smaller chunks that are more manageable. This will help keep motivation levels high as each mini-task accomplished creates momentum for further progress. A great way to stay focused is by setting realistic goals and deadlines that work within our own schedule. For example, if I’m working on a project due in two weeks, I’ll set aside certain days or hours throughout the week dedicated solely to completing this task – no exceptions!\n\n### To maintain enthusiasm when tackling long-term projects over several months, there are three key elements to consider:\n\nBreaking up big tasks: When faced with a daunting task ahead of us, it helps to break them into achievable steps so we can celebrate small successes along the way.\n\n• Planning ahead: Taking some extra time out before starting a major project allows us to prepare for any possible roadblocks ahead of time which could save precious minutes later on .\n\n• Rewarding ourselves: Celebrating milestones achieved during lengthy assignments gives us something tangible to look forward to other than just crossing off another item from our never-ending list of things to do.\n\nManaging our time effectively is essential for success both professionally and personally. With practice and patience anyone can learn how best to use their allotted hours each day — whether that means studying for upcoming exams or finding ways to relax after a stressful meeting. Ultimately, having control over our schedules leads us closer towards achieving our goals without feeling overwhelmed in the process.\n\n### How Can I Prioritize Tasks To Make Sure I Am Focusing On The Most Important Ones First?\n\nWith the average person spending three hours and fifteen minutes on their phones each day, it is clear that proper time management is more important than ever. Prioritizing tasks can be daunting task for many people; however, there are techniques you can use to help make sure your most important tasks get done first.\n\nFirst and foremost, creating a list of everything you need to do in order of importance can help you stay focused and organized. Make sure to check off items as they are completed so that nothing gets overlooked. Additionally, breaking down larger projects into smaller chunks will make them easier to manage and keep track of. For example, if you have an essay due at the end of the week, break it up by completing one section per day instead of trying to write it all in one sitting.\n\n### Here are some other tips for prioritizing tasks:\n\n* **Set achievable goals** – Being realistic about what needs to be accomplished during certain times helps prevent overwhelm and procrastination when managing multiple tasks.\n* **Take breaks** – Taking short breaks throughout the day allows your mind to rest and refocus before jumping back into work mode.\n* **Delegate or outsource** – If possible, delegation or outsourcing can free up valuable time spent doing mundane activities like filing paperwork or scheduling meetings so you can focus on more pressing matters.\n\nIt’s also ok not to try and tackle every single thing on your plate. Knowing when to say “no” or ask for help from others is key in maintaining a balance between personal commitments and professional objectives without sacrificing too much sleep!\n\n### How Can I Avoid Procrastination?\n\nIt can be tempting to procrastinate on tasks that seem unpleasant, tedious or difficult. However, this behavior often leads to stress and poor time management skills. How do we avoid giving in to the urge? By following a few simple steps!\n\nTo start with, it’s important to break down any task into smaller chunks – if you look at something too big all at once, you may feel overwhelmed and unable to get started. Breaking up an intimidating project into manageable pieces is key for success – like eating an elephant (as they say) one bite at a time!\n\nNext up is creating a timeline for yourself. Set realistic goals and deadlines as well as rewards along the way so that you have motivation to keep going. For example, after finishing your first section of work, take 5 minutes off and enjoy a cup of coffee before moving onto the next part. This will help prevent burnout from working on projects for long stretches without breaks.\n\nThirdly, hold yourself accountable by asking someone else – such as a friend or family member – to check in with you about progress periodically during your deadline period. Having another person there helps increase productivity twofold: not only are you more motivated knowing someone else is tracking your progress but also letting them know what you plan on accomplishing holds us accountable for actually doing it!\n\nFinally, don’t forget why you wanted to complete this task in the first place; remind yourself regularly of the end goal benefits of getting through it quickly and effectively! Keeping sight of our purpose gives us valuable perspective when faced with challenging tasks ahead– use these moments as opportunities for growth both mentally and professionally\n\nand to increase resilience.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTime management is an invaluable skill to have in order to be successful and productive. Once we understand the benefits, tips, challenges, and strategies for time management, we can begin to implement them into our lives. By taking small steps towards becoming better at managing our time, such as setting realistic goals and using tools like calendars or planners, it’s possible to become more efficient with how we spend our days. It’s like a domino effect – by improving your own personal efficiency you’ll ‘knock down’ barriers that used to stand in your way of achieving what you want!\n\nUltimately, good time management requires self-discipline and proactive decision-making. You need to decide what tasks are most important so they get done first; this will give you a sense of accomplishment throughout the day which helps create motivation. With some practice and perseverance, you’ll find yourself able to accomplish more than ever before! As the saying goes: “time is of the essence” – make sure yours is being spent wisely!\n\nThe key takeaway here is that time management isn’t about doing everything perfectly right away but rather understanding where improvements can be made and gradually implementing those changes over time. So don’t wait another minute – start getting organized today and take control of your life!",

So I started to hide things I bought for myself or I lied about the price. And here I am now at 25y, having my own salary and yet I still have this inner fear that I would be judged by my parents, gf or friends that I spend money on things that they think are unnessesary. I'm not saying that I can't control myself but for example I collect books and recently I bought 2 for my collection but a new one came out today and I got very excited that I can get that one too. So I am determinded to go get it but I plan to hide it till next month and then show it. I feel guilty for \"disrespecting\" their views and don't know how to overcome it. Thanks.",

        "text": "Time management is an art that not everyone can master. It requires skill and discipline, but once you do it will be your best friend. With the proper use of this skill, you’ll find yourself getting more done in less time. You’ll also experience improved productivity, better work-life balance, and a general sense of control over your life. In this article, we’ll discuss why time management matters and how to develop the skills necessary for success.\n\nWe all have 24 hours in a day – how much of those precious hours are wasted? All too often, people feel like they never have enough time to finish their to-do lists or even relax and enjoy themselves. This can lead to stress and anxiety as deadlines approach faster than progress can be made. But what if there was a way to maximize our time so that every minute counts? That’s where learning effective time management techniques come into play!\n\nBy understanding the value of managing your time properly, you can begin making positive changes toward improving your overall well-being. Not only will it help boost efficiency at work, but it will also free up space in your personal schedule for activities that bring joy and happiness. So let’s explore some actionable strategies on how to get started with mastering the art of time management!\n\n### The Benefits Of Time Management\n\nTime management is an increasingly important skill for many of us in today’s world. According to a recent survey, the average person spends nearly 4 hours on their phone every single day. With this statistic in mind, it’s easy to see how beneficial time management can be.\n\nThe benefits of effective time management are far-reaching and wide-ranging. Firstly, by becoming better at managing our own time we become more organized and productive with both everyday tasks like grocery shopping or cleaning up around the house and also bigger projects such as work assignments or studying for exams. Additionally, having good strategies for utilizing our days efficiently leads to less stress during crunch times when there seems to be too much going on all at once. Lastly, making efficient use of our time allows us to make room for activities that help us relax and recharge such as exercising or reading a book — something that can have huge impacts on overall physical and mental health in the long run.\n\nImplementing these habits into practice requires understanding one’s needs and desires while still prioritizing productivity which will ultimately lead to greater success down the road.\n\n### Tips For Improving Time Management Skills\n\nTime management is a crucial skill for any successful person. One of the best ways to improve this ability is to practice and develop tips specifically tailored toward one’s own lifestyle. For example, one college student found success by setting aside 30 minutes every morning before class to plan their day and prioritize tasks. This routine allowed them to identify which activities were most important, allowing them to focus on those first while avoiding distractions that come with procrastination.\n\nIn addition, making lists can be extremely helpful in ensuring nothing gets forgotten or overlooked when trying to stay organized and productive. After jotting down all goals for the week ahead, it’s recommended to break bigger tasks into smaller chunks that are easier to tackle one at a time. Not only does this make completing each task feel more manageable; it also prevents feeling overwhelmed as well as helps keep the momentum going throughout the working process.\n\nTaking regular breaks from work is just as necessary as planning out what needs doing in order to maximize efficiency. Allowing yourself some downtime throughout the day will help you remain focused and energized during longer periods of concentration — leading to better quality results overall due to increased productivity levels! To further ensure total commitment towards accomplishing set objectives, creating rewards for oneself after crossing off items from a list can assist in staying motivated along your journey towards achieving self-improvement through improved time management skills. Without these simple but effective techniques, committing fully to managing time wisely may become much more difficult than it has to be!\n\n### Common Challenges In Time Management\n\nTime management is a skill that many of us struggle with, yet it’s absolutely essential to living an organized and productive life. Could there be something more than just lack of discipline behind our struggles? According to scientific research, the answer may very well be yes! Our brains are wired in such a way that certain tasks take longer to complete than others. This means that our natural inclination toward procrastination can’t always be attributed to laziness or lack of motivation – sometimes we’re simply working against our own biology.\n\nVarious external factors can also contribute to difficulties managing time effectively. Having too much on your plate at once often leads to feeling overwhelmed when trying to prioritize tasks, as does having too little information about what needs to be done and when it needs to be completed by. Additionally, attempting to multitask between different activities can lead us down a rabbit hole of distraction, where we end up spending far too long on one task while neglecting another altogether.\n\nNavigating these obstacles requires some effort – but with the right strategies, you’ll find yourself back on track before you know it.\n\n### Strategies For Overcoming Time Management Struggles\n\nTime management is a skill that many of us struggle with, but it doesn’t have to be.

        "text": "I’ve done it, most of us have, shit lot of us in our 20s fall victim to it. Spending time by yourself &amp; going bck to the normal habits u were used to outside of a relationship etc is not working on yourself. I’ve heard the tale of “do your best to reflect when you start dating or looking for a job again”. Terrible advice, do you start studying for a test the day that it’s on when you failed the last 3 exams? Or do you study consistently over the course of weeks/days BEFORE the test? \n\n\nThis is a relationship example, but I just hate the idea &amp; lack of accountability I had when all I did the first month from being broken up with was spend time with my friends &amp; get bck into old hobbies. Don’t get me wrong, it helped, but it was just a bandaid. Many will argue(ur doing it for urself) but if I do all that &amp; im still let’s say “emotionally unavailable or anxious avoidant” am I not fking my future self &amp; the women he will one day date? A short term fix breaks everything else. Please take the time to reflect on your past behaviors, habits, &amp; what you can do to remedy/improve etc. Getting bck into habits &amp; finding new ones is great, but it’s easy to forget making a habit of self-reflection &amp; actionable change. We all failed tests, figured out what we could’ve done better, studied &amp; did better for future tests right? Let’s do that with self improvement!",

        "text": "I kinda don't have a choice about being on the perma self improvement arc. My life dealt me a poor set of cards so I want to do the best with them. I convince myself that I like to suffer so it is not bad anymore, but it is never a good thing to lie to yourself and rationalize it on a regular basis. The question is how long I will be able to keep this up. But until it works I am not fixing it... Hoping for the best.\n\nI would like to get some clarity and maybe some feedback from you. I am considering doing some series of posts to remind me on what I have to improve and somewhat commit to it with posting the post on here with improvements.\n\nI was until recently very depressed, fat and generally unhealthy. I also had a very low paying job. My social life is generally terrible and my confidence + independence almost non existant. Some of you might see the text below as bragging, but I guarantee you I am still in a terrible spot, and that is the reason why I post. I really just don't want to be where I am currently at.\n\nRecent events kind of harmed me(parent died), but I have a pretty awesome few months on the basis of self improvement:  \n\\- started a reading habit and learning increased in general  \n\\- survived a burnout which opened my eyes about my limits  \n\\- started fasting and lost almost 30 kg of which I regained less than 5 kg  \n\\- started doing daily walks and almost got a 4M steps last year(which I will top this year for sure)  \n\\- got employed again and am excelling in my job very well  \n\\- am starting to open up to the world and seeking contacts to get out of my shell with talks and calls on a regular\n\nThere are some real problems on the way for me personally:  \n\\- still living with my family, so dating(which I would like to start doing) might be a problem  \n\\- on the front of dating I am not sure what I want, and indecision is really prevalent in my life  \n\\- I really want to have kids some day, but my time is running out with my mid 30-s  \n\\- I don't almost take any risks and with it I am knowingly always living below my potential  \n\\- I have zero confidence and I don't really have a drive to get me forward. Everything I do are just habits I cultivated enough for them to become part of me  \n\\- even tho I walk over 10k steps every day, I really can't bring myself to get into fitness and the gym  \n\\- I am overthinking constantly, even this post I rewrote like 3 times  \n\\- I tend to learn instead of doing too often  \n\\- I could lose another 20 kg  \n\\- I don't care about my appearance\n\nMy currently countable achievements are:  \n\\- half a year worth of savings in the bank  \n\\- increased salary by 50% from previous job  \n\\- almost 4M steps a year  \n\\- over 400 leetcode problems solved with over 250 daily streak(if you don't know what that is, just ignore it, it means something to me)  \n\\- losing 30 kg\n\nMy wants are:  \n\\- lose 10 kg more  \n\\- get to 4.5M steps a year  \n\\- increase my salary by another 33% in the next 3 years  \n\\- get a meaningful long term relationship  \n\\- get more hobbies\n\nFeel free to give advices and suggestions. I am currently really struggling. I have some improvement to show, but I know for a fact that I am not utilizing myself properly and it is getting me depressed.\n\nMy priority right now is my job. I want to make my manager not only approve me as a valuable part of the company, but to be astonished of how good I actually am. I am however still mourning over my parent, and can't really pick myself up properly. I am dealing with it by thinking and caring about others. Therapy is not an option. I am a lunatic and I am fully aware of it, but my parents death made me also aware of how short life is, that is why I don't want to waste it anymore than I have to.\n\nI will come back if you let me, hopefully with progress. In the meantime give me anything you think might help me, whatever it is. If you think calling me a moron works, do that to. I would prefer not, but  a kick in the butt is a step forward as well.\n\nHave a nice week!",

        "text": "It feels good to exist as potential, whether you're a kid with a \"bright future\" or you're just entering the workforce.\n\nWhat nobody tells you is that the process of converting your potential into reality is always disappointing. Possibilities are always infinite while reality is finite. You're going to struggle walking down any road you choose, and choosing a road means you sacrifice all your other possibilities.\n\nThis is why it's tempting to not try, to not commit to anything. It feels good to be full of potential rather than to engage in the grinding, discouraging, sometimes-straight-up-depressing work of turning your potential into something tangible.\n\nBut there's an expiration date. Potential doesn't last forever. It has a short shelf life. And when it goes bad, you're stuck with nothing. So you might as well embrace the suck, might as well do what you can with what you have, right now.\n\nConvert your comforting dreams of potential into reality and you shall receive the tangible, real rewards of the world.",

I struggle severely with self-esteem and self-confidence, I always see myself as the 'ugly-friend' or just someone who could never realistically be the object of someone's attention as I am not conventionally attractive. This unfortunately hasn't stopped even after I got into a relationship and instead I feel has maybe gotten worse in a way. Today for example, my bf and I were walking around a clothing store and I wanted to look at some jeans, well I prefer high-waisted jeans because of my body shape and never really liked mid-rise or low-rise (I personally think low-rise look trashy, but that's just my opinion) well, my bf made a comment saying: \"I love low-rise jeans on women because they look sexy\" I said: \"well, maybe I am not the right girl for you, because it seems that I am the opposite of what you typically go for.\" Which, I am. He didn't really say anything to that. Well when we got home, he said \"Are you okay?\" I said \"well, you never really commented on what I said.\" He said \"I really can't say anything around you can I?\" \n\nSo, all this to say, how can I work to improve my self-image to avoid feeling this way all the time? I'm so tired of not even being able to compliment my own looks without physically gagging, or taking it back. Any advice is welcome. Thank you for reading.",

It allows you more time to concentrate on your objectives, exercise, practice meditation, or just relax before the day becomes busy.\n\nWrite Down Your Objectives: Putting your goals in writing makes them more real and makes you more accountable for achieving them. Make sure to put your desired outcomes in writing and make them both clear and quantifiable. Check back on your list frequently to keep yourself inspired and on course.\n\nPractice Thankfulness: Practicing gratitude for a little period of time each day may make a significant difference in your life. You may feel more upbeat and inspired to work toward your objectives if you concentrate on what you do have rather than what you lack.\n\nRead Daily: Reading is a fantastic method to learn and advance. Make sure to block out time each day to read and learn something new, whether it's from a book about your job or a book about personal growth.\n\nExercise often: Exercise frequently benefits both your physical and mental wellbeing. Exercise may help you feel better emotionally, have more energy, and lower stress, all of which can make it easier and more focused for you to accomplish your goals.",

I had a lot of bad habits. \n\n\\- Drinking 3-4 large cans of beer 5x a week\n\n\\- Didnt go doctors (which was the worst mistake) \n\n**The beginning:** \n\nThe first thing I did was quit drinking alone. I drink but once a month or so few beers. What I notice was my sleep improved and I can start much faster my mornings. Im currently looking for a new job and usualy I didnt start to write my first  application before 11:30. Now I wake up at 8:00-8:30 and start writing. I work full day and hit the gym and go home and either game or read some books. \n\nOne problem I still had was that my body was falling me. I had cramps, I was always in pain and felt very slugish. \n\n**Middle part:** \n\nSo the next project was visting a doctor. I decided to visit a specialst and it took a while to gather all resuluts and suprise suprise I have a lot stuff going on. I felt relieved that it was just \"lazyness\" .\n\n**Now:** \n\nknow I take a ton of meds for few weeks and these make \"sloppy\" but I my health improved and I feel great. I get so much stuff done. My mind is super sharp again and I get shit done. I missed this! I can compherant complex stuff fairly easy again. \n\nAnd the crazyiest part is: I have so much energy and freetime its insane. I dont know what I have to do with myself. I need to find new hobbys etc. \n\nI work 50+ hours a week on application, I hit the gym 5x a week. I read books and I work in a small start up and I still feel not tired at all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy health is still not 100% but when it will be it must be like having super powers ! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll the best !",

        "text": "The problem: [F]rom being a mess to having my life in place through discipline, I had developed a decent relationship with my body by 25 last year but something happened that broke this discipline and I am again a mess. I feel like I am back to zero, back to that pit I had pulled myself out of in the last few years. I feel I have lost all progress just when life demanded it the most out of me. And only I am to be blamed. I failed to establish boundaries. I was complacent. I failed to stand up for myself. I failed myself. I let people get to my head and I am suffering every moment because of it. I feel stuck. I wake up with panic attacks. I was so proud that I had fought for sleep and fought against insomnia but what's the point now? Also this is the first time ever in life that I am feeling...sad. Extremely sad. I dont know if this is depression. I couldnt cry before but now I do. I can cry while climbing the stairs or hitting the bed or while trying to get out of home. It is like my body responding to me for forcing myself to get out of home or doing something I did not want to do in the first place. I want to hate, I want to scream in anger, yet I cant. It's like life is giving me lemons and I am choking on it.\n\nSolution: I want to get better. Starting tomorrow, I will practice discipline again and stay true to myself and not let anyone get in that space where they can f*ck with my mental health. I wont let people capitalise on my low self-worth. I dont have to please anyone and I dont need anyone. I am strong, I dont have to feel shitty for saying 'no' or repeat something multiple times to establish boundaries. And if people fail to respect that, I dont have to be consumed with guilt. Self-preservation should be of utmost importance and you cant be happy in others' happiness. You choose your happiness even in hard times. Prioritise your needs. You dont have to comply simply because something isn't causing you harm. From tomorrow, I will look into the mirror, see myself through my own eyes, remember who I am and what I have achieved so far and what I aspire to achieve and I will try to be better. I will reclaim my own self-worth so that others do not get to define my self-worth. I will see reality for what it is, instead of being told what it is.",

We both go to therapy - I go for my 'bending over backwards' tendencies and OCD, and my boyfriend goes for social and car anxiety (fear of being 'stuck' someplace for too long). \n\nAdditionally, I'm the eldest daughter in my family and my mom is currently experiencing a post-op complication that has left her spirits low. It's painful to see her the way she is. She's ordered to stay at home until April. I find myself ruminating about her situation and taking responsibility to move her recovery forward in terms of finding the best next steps. It's exhausting and helpless. \n\nI am really sensitive to mood changes and have lately 'lost' myself in these two worlds. I get down when my boyfriend is anxious. I feel the negativity and mood shift when I'm excited about an event, and he's dreading it. With my mom, it's pretty self-explanatory. I feel guilt when I have live my own life instead of being there to support her and my dad with her doctor visits (which would entail me commuting 1.5 hours each way to see her). \n\nOn top of it all - I'm overworked at work with my entry-level job. \n\nI had a mental breakdown on Thursday and sobbed for 20 minutes. I hit my peak after speaking to my mom about some bad news she got at the doctor's office. I contemplated breaking up with my boyfriend because his anxiety is sometimes all-consuming and I have doubts about building a family together. I've been detached from things since Thursday. I'm slowly feeling grounded. \n\nANYWAYS: **tl;dr I've lost myself in other people's problems. How do I get out of this and not lose myself for good? (Besides therapy which in it of itself if triggering).**",

I've also neglected my health for the past 5 years which made me physically very weak. \n\nI realize time seems to be going faster and I need to wake up, get out of this slump, set my emotions aside and work my ass off. \n\nAny advice on how not to get distracted and stay focused is appreciated",

        "text": "Context: I’m a 19 year old male about to turn 20 in a few weeks. I have never been in a serious relationship/ had sex. I just started a new university in January and there’s like 40,000 students. I don’t typically go out downtown to bars a lot because I don’t have many friends that go. I also embarrassed myself by fighting blacked out off alcohol in public or in front of friends throughout high school like 3 times. So now I try to be extremely careful whenever drinking in public and should probably just not drink unless it’s social. The thing is I know going out is an easy way to meet girls but I really don’t like going by myself because it’s not as fun. I’ve also had better luck talking with girls when in bars compared to in class. The few girls that I text through Snapchat I met off tinder and they all seem not that interested because I’ll be on delivered for a while. I also think I could improve my texting skills because it feels like I’m interviewing them questions and not making the convo engaging. I have really only had a decent conversation with like 2 girls at my school because we were in a group project but I wasn’t really attracted to either. And I went on like 2 dates with a girl from tinder but she basically said I was a red-flag and it felt pretty uncomfortable. I walk past hundreds if not thousands of attractive girls every day and I know I won’t have this opportunity the rest of my life. I would say I’m in decent shape but could get more muscle. I have confidence that I’m decently attractive. I have a height advantage, 6’2 180lbs but definitely have hella flaws. I smoke way too much weed every day(3/4 times), drink too much alcohol (4/5 times a week), hit my vape everyday even though I know I look like a douchebag. I also have hyperhidrosis so I sweat like crazy just about everywhere. I didn’t meet a lot of people at a different college last year and I want to make a big change. I live off campus with 3 people who are not in college because of cheap rent. I take a bus to campus but that doesn’t seem like the best place to talk to girls/ people in general. Especially when the entire bus is listening to you talk. I usually just keep my AirPods in on the bus and when walking around campus. I stay on campus a few hours a week to study and there’s always cute girls but it’s dead silent usually. Should I start going out to bars by myself? I’ve been asking matches on tinder through Snapchat if they want to go out but I don’t think they do. This weekend I had the house to myself and couldn’t get anyone over. I’m ready to change my lifestyle any advice helps.",

        "text": "I struggle with motivation, but I know habit is often more effective. The thing is that I end up having trouble building a proper routine because I freak out and get derailed without it. I also tend to freak out when I feel calm because I'm not used to it, I guess? \n\nI've heard of the phrase \"fuck it, we ball\" for making decisions and it's really helped me with stuff. Like if I think \"I'm not gonna pass this test anyways \" I can stay \"fuck it we ball\" and study hard anyways. It's quick and snapy and I like it. It's very effective. \n\nBut now I feel like i need something more to tell myself! I've thought about \"I'm gonna move out and live alone!\" But that feels to broad and at times scary. I really want to go caving though. \"I want to do caving\" is also broad but at the end of the day it's a cave and I'm not gonna freak out about what wall colour I'll paint it. \n\nIt feels great when I think about it. \"Exercise to go caving\" \"save money to go caving\" \"lose wight for caving\" \"improve your memory for caving\" \"learn how to drive (to get to a national park) for caving\" \" get outside more for caving\" \" get organized for caving\" \"learn to remain calm for caving\" \"get better sleep for caving\" \"get over your fear of heights for caving\" \"learn how to deal with unpleasant clothes for caving\" \"see professionals to help me with mental and physical issues so i can go caving\" \" finally learn rock climbing for caving\" \"maintain your body well so I can go caving for many years\" ect.. \n\nI haven't even been caving! Now that i think about it I don't know if I've ever actually been in a real cave. I'm very interested in going one day though but for that to happen I will need to be in a good financial situation and ideally a good physical and mental condition as well. I understand that there are different difficulty ranked so I would love to be able to work my way up to at Least a level 3. \n\nI live in Canada so there are many spots I've been looking at online. Unfortunately I can't get to any foot and I don't know if I can get there via public transit. I don't think my parents would be interested in taking me. I also don't want to go with my parents. However, a guide would be good because I have a terrible sense of direction. \n\nI fantasize about being in caves a lot. I love the dark and I also l Iove the woods. The problem is that I don't go our as much as I'd like. I find myself often feeling over or under whemed without earphones (mine are broken). Ontop of that, I've been dealing with mild paranoia and heavier \"zoning out\". I really need to help ground myself by doing things like going out and looking after my physical and mental well-being. This will help me mental \n\nDespite asking for help, it's a massive challenge to get anything done with professionals. I suspect i have adhd and/or autism as well as PCOs, but I haven't seen anyone specific for it. My doctor wouldn't even let me get screened for adhd because my teachers didn't bring it up. The same doctors office messed up my auto birth control perception, so I went without it for two months. I (politely) marched my ass in after school one day and managed to talk to the pharmacy ladies. I made them realize the mistake and got my stuff! Turns out my mother, who called eariler to scream and cursed at them, then hung up, wasn't the best help. \n\nSince then, I've realized that my actions actually do have power and that I'm not trapped in the same cycle. I've been more \"brave\" lately because of it, and I communicate more by myself directly to teachers and speak more. I've even joined the chess club despite not being well experienced (it's going well). I also participate in more Hobbies and take my dogs out more. \n\nI think that's why caving interests me so much. I must actively seek out to do it. It's really helped me become a more proactive person. I still struggle sometimes, though! \n\nI'm mainly worried that \"do [insert thing] to go caving\" might be a bad motivation.I've seen people critique the idea of doing something to get a girlfriend so I'm not sure if doing something to do eventually do a different thing will be okay.\n\n I've heard so many people say, \"Do it for yourself.\" But I struggle with myself and feel like doing it for a goal would be better. I just want to go in a cave, In doing this, I hope to improve myself along the way.\n\n But if that's my motivation, will it become the only thing I think about? Will this idea stop me from living in the moment? Should i just ignore the cave thing for now and focus more on developing good habits? Do I need to do things for myself instead of external reward? Would caving count as an external or internal reward? How can I prevent the idea of \" do [insert thing] for caving\" from getting out of hand? Is it a bad thing if I  eventually do go caving, and then my whole thing is just caving? Like job, savings, time management all towards caving? Is feeling this passion for something I've never done going to impact me negatively? Both sides of my family have health issues. What happens if I try my best to prevent those issues, but I still get them, and it impacts my ability to go caving? \n\nEven if doing things just to go caving is a \"bad\" motivation, do you think it will be worth it if it still improves my life and wellbeing. I saw videos the other day of men talking about how their pets improved their lives, and my feelings towards caving remind me of that. \n\nI would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you!",
