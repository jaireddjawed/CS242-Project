If you're wrong, you die.\n\nSome of your friends protested they are put in an unfair position, so Death relented: \n\n &gt; If no more than 3 of you get it correctly, you may have another guess.\n\nDeath then goes to Friend A, who guessed correctly in the first try and is revived.  His guess was not made public to the others, but Death made it known it is correct.\nDeath then asks Friend H, and then Friend C.  Both of which did not take a guess.  \n\nNow it's your turn, [and you're in position (F).  Facing you is Friend A (revived) who is wearing Green, Friend C wearing Red, and Friend E wearing Yellow.](http://imgur.com/OxSULoP)\n\n**Can you guess your colour correctly?**\n\n##Bonus Question: \n\nDeath taunted, \n&gt; If you can guess the colour of the masks on all of your friends correctly during this turn, you may all live.\n\n**Can you save all of your friends?**",

        "text": "I remember reading this in a riddle book as a child, not sure of the source. Sorry for the length, there's a TLDR version at the end.\n\nA young couple eloped to a beautiful seaside town and, on their wedding night, the man decided to pick his wife a rose from a nearby garden. Unknown to him, the garden belonged to a witch.\n\nWhen he picked the rose, the entire rosebush wilted. The witch appeared, furious, and told him he would pay for his crime as soon as the sun rose. He returned to his wife and they spent a wonderful night together, but at sunrise he awoke to find she was gone, the rose lying in her still-warm spot next to him.\n\nHe dashed through the chilly morning air to the garden. In the twilight he searched for the spot near the wilted rosebush where he had met the witch, but found only fifteen perfect rosebushes and no sign of his meeting last night.\n\nThe witch then appeared, telling the man that in return for the rose he stole from her, she now claimed his precious rose as her own, a bush to replace the one she'd lost.\n\nWith a grin the witch added a caveat. Pick out which bush was his wife, and she would be turned back. Guess wrong, and he would also be added to her collection.\n\nThe man agreed but, as he gazed about him at the bushes, realized they had been magicked to be indistinguishable from one another, down to the last thorn and petal. Tears streamed from his face as he made the decision to spend the rest of eternity in this garden, as a bush, with his wife. He moved towards a random bush to make his choice.\n\nThen suddenly, he stopped. As the witch watched, he then hurriedly inspected several bushes, and stopped at one.\n\n\"This is my beloved\" shouted the man \"we agreed, now turn her back at once!\"\n\nDefeated, she turned his wife back into a human.\n\n\"You are free to go, man, but tell me, how did you know?\"\n\n\"Truly\" said the man \"I was stumped until my despair guided me. You who have never know great joy nor great sorrow could not have hoped for the same!\"\n\nTears of happiness in their eyes, the young couple left the garden, tight in one another's embrace. The witch looked after them, puzzled.\n\nHow did the man know which bush was his wife?\n\n[TLDR/Hint](#s \"A man wakes up in the morning to find his wife missing, and was turned into a rosebush in a nearby rose garden. Despite the bushes being identical, he's able to pick out which one is her. How?\")",

        "text": "Hello, guys!\n\nWe‚Äôve created an [animated video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MSZQekJWFE) on one of the variations of the **Prisoner Hat Riddle**. It‚Äôs not a hard riddle but it‚Äôs an interesting one.\n\n‚ÄúFour men are arrested for a crime, but the jail is full and the warden has nowhere to put them. He eventually comes up with the solution of giving them a puzzle so if they solve it they can go free but if they fail they will be executed. \nThe warden arranges three of the criminals into a line. The fourth man is put behind a wall and can‚Äôt see any of the other fellows. Man 3 can only see the wall, man 2 can only see man 3 and man 1 can see both men 2 and men 3. The warden gives each of the criminals a hat and explains that there are two red hats and two blue hats [from left to right - man 1 is given a red hat, man 2 - also a red hat, man 3 and man 4 (man 4 is the one behind the wall) are both wearing blue hats]. The rules are simple: \nIf ANY of the criminals can figure out what‚Äôs the color of his hat with 100% certainty and shouts it out, all four men will be set free. But if any of them suggests an incorrect answer, all four men will be executed. They are not allowed to turn round or move, to talk to each other or to take their hats off.\nIf we presume that all 4 fellows think quite logically, **who will be the first person to shout out and why?**‚Äù\n\nYou can find the answer and an explanation in the [video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MSZQekJWFE). Hope you enjoy it!\n\nP.S.: We‚Äôve read the community‚Äôs guidelines but we are new here and we apologize if the post is breaking any rules.\n",

Victors are allowed to submit puzzles or riddles to be added to the Enigma (the name of the game). \n\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The game is designed to be confusing and not very straight forward. Some puzzles will not be 100% fair, you will sometimes need to think outside of the box. \n\n**MORE IMPORTANT:** I apologize for this not being clear, but in order to fully solve the Enigma you must NOT use any skips in solving it. The skips are implemented in order to help you make progress without getting stuck at a question. If you do use skips and get to the end, hit the restart button and try again!\n\nThere is supposed to be minimal help/explanation. It is meant for the player to figure out both the game and the puzzles.\n\n\nPlease enjoy!\n\n\nhttps://elliothume.github.io/enigma.html\n\n\nP.S. One mechanic can be confusing, so I will explain one thing. You are allowed to use Google if the puzzle has a green check mark on the page. This may be because either Google will not help or the puzzle is too hard that the puzzle itself is in the action of looking it up.\n\nP.P.S. This is my first Reddit post, I apologize if I break any rules.",

        "text": "#Escape the Mansion  \n  \nWelcome to my evil little puzzle!   \nFor your amusement, I have trapped 6 people in a mansion with their work tools scattered around randomly.  \nTo escape, they must reach the room with the secret exit alone, using the tool that matches their occupation to break the lock.  \nThere are exactly 5 rooms each in the Main Floor and Basement.  It's in your best interest to figure out the \"Floor Plan\" ASAP.  \nIn a period of 4 hours, each person searches a new room and didn't return to a room they've visited.  \nIf a room has been visited by 3 different persons, it becomes inaccessible to everyone.  \nOnly at most 2 persons were together in the same room in the same hour.  \nEach room has 1 tool at most; the 1st person who visited the room alone always takes the tool with them.  \nIf 2 persons met in a room, the person with a lethal tool (i.e. Lock Pick and Calculator are not lethal) will kill the other person without a lethal tool.  \n  \nBelow are the events that unfolded:  \n1.) For the first 3 hours, there were exactly 3 person on each Floor.  \n2.) The Police has never been to the Main Floor, where The Firefighter has visited the Dining Room and the Billiard Room.  \n3.) Nobody searched the Pool, Billiard Room, or the Gym until the 3rd hour.  \n4.) Nobody searched the Dining Room and the Living Room after the 2nd hour.  \n5.) The Storage was searched by Oswald, the Police, and Garrett in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd hour respectively, each person alone.  \n6.) The Chef stayed on the Main Floor but never visited the Billiard Room, and was never alone except in the Pool at the 3rd hour.  \n7.) Tina and the Plumber ran into each other at the Billiard Room at the 3rd hour.  Nobody else has visited the Room.  \n8.) The Chef and Mallory both started at the Living Room which doesn't have any tool.  \n9.) The Firefighter and Garrett has never been to the Living Room and the Kitchen.  \n10.) Walter and the Plumber both searched the Theatre and the Storage alone in the first 2 hours. Both of them found the wrong tool, one of which was a Pistol.  \n11.) The Plumber spent the last 2 hours in the Main Floor.  \n12.) The Teacher spent 3 hours in the Main Floor searching the Pool, Kitchen, and the Living Room, but has searched the Basement once in between.  \n13.) Oswald has ran into someone in the Billiard Room right before he ran into the Knife wielding Florence in the Kitchen.  \n14.) Garrett has never been to the Laundry but picked up the Calculator in the 1st hour, but the Teacher did not pick up a tool until the 2nd hour.  \n15.) Both Tina and the Petty Thief switches Floor each hour.  \n16.) They've been to the Dining Room but haven't met each other.  \n17.) They've never searched the Gym, Kitchen, or the Living Room.  The Wrench is in one of these 3 rooms.  \n18.) Only the Laundry and the Study were visited exactly once, alone.  \n19.) The Axe was either at the Storage, Laundry or the Kitchen.  \n20.) The person who found the Lockpick at the Theatre was murdered at the 3rd hour in the Gym, where nobody visited afterwards.  \n21.) Only 1 person escaped successfully, and it happened at the 4th hour.  \n  \nQuestions:  \n1.) Who got murdered?  \n2.) Who was the murderer?  \n3.) Who escaped and in what room?  \n4.) Given the circumstances, who will be killed in the 4th hour?  \n5.) Given 1 more hour, who is most likely to escape next?  \n  \n[Here is a coloured text version for readability (updated from feedback)](http://imgur.com/FCXMGq9)\n\nHope you guys enjoy this as much I did creating it!

He was working a late night, and called me to let me know that he'd pick something up on the way home. Thought he sounded...strange.\n\nI: Strange?\n\nE: Yeah. It's hard to describe, but it sounded like he was...preoccupied with something. Like he was already busy when he called. \n\nI: Did he enjoy his job? Was he well liked?\n\nE: Yeah, he loved his job. Got him free seats to plays whenever he was off work. There was this one guy, Kane. He was always at odds with Joe, but I never thought something might happen. \n\nI: What is Kane's full name?\n\nE: I think it's...Kane Powers. Dunno his last name. But he was always a creepy looking guy. Had a scar on his left hand, like it had been shot. And it never healed.\n\nI: What do you mean?\n\nE: It never healed. Joe always told me that it always looked like the wound was made less than a week ago. It's odd, ain't it?\n\nI: (after a pause) Yes. Odd. What was Joseph like at home?\n\nE: Oh, he was a sweet guy. Always thinking about me. Though he'd get into these blue periods sometimes...never was quite the same after that accident in '09.\n\nI: The accident in '09? What was that? (Eliza looked visibly nervous.)\n\nE: Well...in any case, he was always a little depressed after that. He had some anti-depression medications. Duloxetine, I think. \n\nI: And how long ago was this?\n\nE: A year ago. He just got prescribed for a greater dose two weeks ago.\n\nI: One last question. Has Joseph ever been known to have suicidal tendencies?\n\nE: What?!\n\nI: We can't rule out any possibilities.\n\nE: No, of course he didn't!\n\nI: (after shuffling papers) Thank you for your time, Mrs. Howard.

If you can't figure it out give me another number and I'll do it a progression for it. \n\nEDIT: Fixed a mistake.",
