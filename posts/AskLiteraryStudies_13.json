        "text": "I'm currently writing an essay for a literature subject in which I must defend my own reading practice in light of the core critical debates of the past century. I personally lead toward more of a contextual reading in which the form of a text isn't the only factor worth considering in its analysis, but also the intention/role of the author in their own  historical context, and the affect upon the reader in theirs (perhaps more of a new historical perspective, with a bit of reader response?). However, I feel like critical theory is less black and white today, and I don't fully identify with any one critical practice. Is this how most people feel? Could anyone defend their own reading practice to me (however briefly, but preferably in regards to theories you have studied)? ",

        "text": "Hey /r/AskLiteraryStudies. Since it's inception, there's been a LOT of posts asking something along the lines of \"what do I need to read before I read ______,\" and the answer you're almost always going to get from just about everyone with flair on here is \"Just read it.\" You'll miss stuff. You won't catch references. You won't understand everything, and that's fine. The wide world of thinking and writing is complicated, and there is no \"right\" answer. More importantly, whatever you're reading won't go away once you're done reading – whether that means you finish or you quit. It'll still be there, and in an ideal world, you'll loop back around to it (or at least the ideas in it) again and again, and the way you think about it will change. That's the nature of thought, and less dramatically, the nature of reading. We can give you tips about what might be more or less accessible at different levels of experience and expertise, but that doesn't mean you don't have the baseline capacity to read whatever it is you want to read (given, of course, you can literally read whatever language it's in. I can't read French. So I'm not going to pick up untranslated Baudelaire). \n\nThere's no right path. There's no correct strategy. Everyone who has flair here started by stumbling across something that sparked their mind and got them thinking, and none of us have read everything – because that's impossible. Just read it. Whatever it is, just read it. If it doesn't make sense, read some other stuff. Maybe it'll make more sense, but it doesn't matter.\n\nThere are too many things to read out there to worry about whether or not you should read something – it's a useless proposition, because none of us will ever read everything. So until you yourself can formulate an answer to the question of \"should I read this,\" the answer will always be yes. Get some skin in the game. Just read it. ",

Meanwhile, and also very recently, the short story \"Seasons of Glass and Iron\" by the relatively unknown Amal El-Mohtar managed to win the Hugo, Locus, AND Nebula, as well as being short-listed for three other major prizes. I don't even know if a story has ever done that before, though I'm certainly going to check.\n\nIn the meantime: can you think of any other works (in any genre, of any form) that have received numerous awards of this sort?

I wanted to post this in AskLiteraryStudies for those of you who are unable to post in the literature subreddit.\n\n\n\nFirst off, here are some links:\n\nHere is a link to the Oxford University Press edition of the text: \n\nhttps://libcom.org/files/Franz%20Kafka-The%20Castle%20(Oxford%20World%27s%20Classics)%20(2009).pdf\n\nHere are two websites that list secondary sources, although this discussion should mainly revolve round close reading of the text itself in conjunction with discussions that do not require secondary sources:\n\nhttp://faculty.law.lsu.edu/ccorcos/lawhum/kafkabibliography.htm      (Focuses on the Kafka's work as it relates to the law)\n\nhttps://thespace.lrb.co.uk/bibliography/\n\nAlso, /u/Hickory_54 suggested the incredibly valuable book, K. by Roberto Calasso and translated by Geoffrey Brock in order to explore the protagonist of The Castle as well as the protagonist, Josef K. of Kafka's other unfinished novel, The Trial.\n\n\n\nThis is the introductory thread, so feel free to introduce yourself to others or give any background you would wish. \n\nI am an English professor based in Connecticut, someone who is incredibly passionate about literature, and I am new to the Reddit format so please forgive any errors that are bound to occur. I am also someone who suffers from anxiety/depression issues, which is why I immediately gravitated toward Kafka's writing. However, I am more interested in hearing the various perspectives of Kafka, K., The Castle, and any impending theoretical discussions. After reading several posts in this subreddit, I am thoroughly impressed with the conversations happening, and I am excited to hear what everyone has to say as we move through this work. I want to act as a facilitator rather than a professor during this discussion, and I am willing to answer any questions, but I think that this thread would be way more interesting if we made it a discussion or conversation rather than imposing a classroom structure.\n\nI am suggesting that, in order for people to have ample time to read, we break the novel into manageable chunks per week. If anyone has a better suggestion that can be put up to a vote, please feel free to comment your outline. My suggestion is as follows:\n\n\nWeek One (10/23-10/30) Preface, Intro, and Chapter 1-5\n\nWeek Two (10/31-11/06) Chapters 6-10\n\nWeek Three (11/07-11/14) Chapters 11-15\n\nWeek Four (11/15-11/22) Chapters 16-20\n\nWeek Five (11/23-11/30) Chapter 20-End \n\n\n\nI will make separate threads for each week so that we can break down the information in an easy manner.\n\n\nThank you for stopping by this thread. Happy reading!\n",

You don't need to have read the novel to grasp my idea, essentially I am arguing that, in this passage, time seems compressed and unsegmented (in a linear sense). This, I believe, is illustrated by the close proximity of the nouns (which, in the context of the sentence, denote a long period of time, ie. life, dream) and the verbs (which denote the ending of a passage of time ie, lived, dreamed). Put simply, I was wondering whether a literary term exists for this kind of noun/verb combination (life/lived, dream/dreamed), sorry to have gone on a bit.",

I cannot tell you how many times I was forced to read their most famous works for a school assignment. \n\nSo I was incredibly shocked that none of their books are even on the Bestselling Lists of all time on wikipedia and other respected literature magazine and studies. Instead the one French literary work is The Little Prince, a children's story. \n\nNot only that, but The Little Prince is often recorded on many list including wikipedia's as being the 3RD BESTSELLING BOOK of all time PERIOD! And right after A Tale of Two Cities and The Lord of the Rings, two of the most beloved and respected classics of literature ever. \n\nFurthermore the fact its a children story and a incredibly short one (just a little over 100 pages) also shocked me as hell. Sure Harry Potter may be the bestselling book series of all time but at least the individual books are over 300 pages and the series is considerably lengthy (7 books plus many expanded universe books). \n\nHowever the biggest shock I had was not that its a children's story that rules book sales of French origin and is the most beloved book in France....... \n\nBut the fact I NEVER heard of it before. Before I saw wikipedia's list, as I mentioned earlier I thought Hugo and Dumas would have the bestselling French books of all time. I mean seriously not just high school essays, but even in college they made us do projects on them.\n\nI cannot tell you how many literary professors and critics always shower universal phrase in the American universities I attended on Dumas and Hugo (specifically Count of Monte Cristo and Les Miserables). \n\nNot once did I ever get a recommendation from my literature professors on The Little Prince. \n\nFurthermore even anti-French Americans and Brits at least have respect for France's literary classics and most of all for DUmas and Hugo.\n\nSo I have to wonder why The Little Prince never took the English-speaking world by storm the way Dumas and Hugo did and why its not studied across colleges and universities in United States, United Kingdom, and Australia?\n\nAs I chat with people all over the world on Skype, I am shocked outside of English speaking world and France, The Little Prince is the one book non-French and non-English speaking people are familiar with. I seen people from as remote as Kenya and Vietnam to other Euro nations like Italy and Hungary all shower love towards The Little Prince. \n\nAbout the only non-English speaking area I can think of where The Little Prince didn't sell well is East Asia where Dumas and Hugo are commonly read.",

        "text": "When I research the novel *\"Lolita*\" by Vladimir Nabokov, it seems to be almost universally described as having an \"unreliable narrator\", but I didn't get that feeling from the book.  Maybe my definition is off, but I always thought that the defining characteristic of an \"unreliable narrator\" is that he is not telling the whole truth about the concrete events that occurred in the story.  Obviously this can include outright, intentional lies from the narrator, but it doesn't necessarily have to.  To clarify my personal definition, here are some unusual examples of unreliable narrators:  **(WARNING, SPOILERS)**\n\n* In *\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\"*, the narrator deliberately leaves out crucial information in order to mislead the reader (specifically, that he is the killer).  He doesn't explicitly lie at any point, but he is still unreliable because he omits information that would completely change the reader's perspective.\n\n* In *\"The Repairer of Reputations\"*, in becomes increasingly clear that the narrator is mentally unhinged, and his bizarre descriptions in the story appear to be warped versions of mundane sites.  The narrator is presenting the facts as he sees them, from the point of view of his insane mind - but he is still unreliable because those facts are clearly not at all what is occurring in real life.\n\nHopefully that helps clarify my point of view.  I bring this up, because I'm not sure that I see any clear examples of Humbert (the narrator in \"Lolita\") being unreliable about concrete facts.  People seem to classify him as an unreliable narrator simply because of his sick, warped mind, and his frequent attempts to justify his actions.  Yes, he's an unarguably bad person, and his overall point of view comes from an extremely foreign and repulsive place to the average person - and yes, his does a bizarrely, chillingly good job of getting readers to sympathize with him at points.  However, I just don't see the evidence of him being a proper \"unreliable narrator\" when it comes to the facts of what happened.  The only parts that raised suspicions for me were a couple of sudden convenient coincidences - for instance, the death of Lolita's mother in a sudden car crash, immediately after she learns about Humbert's attractions - but there was no other evidence to suggest that he was lying about it.\n\nIs there something I'm missing here?",

        "text": "I just wondering, what's a good way to find literary devices to use on essays. Like for this passage from Frankenstein: “I read of men concerned in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should have been imbued with different sensations. ‘But Paradise Lost excited different and far deeper emotions. I read it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone. Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me.” \nShould I just try to memorize the top 30 most common literary devices.",

        "text": "I am writing an undergraduate thesis on WWI British poets and shell shock within their writing. I am an English major and History minor, thus my thesis is a humanities work. I have many ideas on how to write this work, but I need a bit of help. I want to go out of my comfort zone for this paper, and do something I have never done: how I can meld creative writing and research into a thesis? My thesis goal, currently, is to show through my eyes and experiences an understanding of their shell shock shown in their work and demonstrate this to others.\nContext: My program had sent me abroad for archival study as well as to study the culture, so I wanted to use my experiences in this work. I was thinking about mixing ethnography, scholarly sources, literature, archival work, and my experiences (visiting their hometowns, landmarks, England, museums, etc.) together. I have an outline so far, but I am struggling on how to organize it since this is a very new concept for me.\n\n[Also, I've had many conversations with my program heads and advisor about all this (I'm in the clear), and am just looking for more advice, tips, example, comments, or criticism!]",

From my reading, the only section of the book that indicates that Bon is not completely white is the section in which Quentin and Shreve are completely making things up. And I only recall Sutpen saying to General Compson that he stopped with his first wife, but never providing a reason. Can someone point me to a place in the text where it is clear, as fact, that Bon is of mixed racial descent?",

        "text": "I am an 11th grade student. This is a quote from the Book III of Rousseau's Emile. Can someone please explain to me what he is saying in this passage?\n\n\n“At first our pupil had merely sensations, now he has ideas; he could only feel, now he reasons. For from the comparison of many successive or simultaneous sensations and the judgment arrived at with regard to them, there springs a sort of mixed or complex sensation which I call an idea. The way in which ideas are formed gives a character to the human mind. The mind which derives its ideas from real relations is thorough; the mind which relies on apparent relations is superficial. He who sees relations as they are has an exact mind; he who fails to estimate them aright has an inaccurate mind; he who concocts imaginary relations, which have no real existence, is a madman; he who does not perceive any relation at all is an imbecile. Clever men are distinguished from others by their greater or less aptitude for the comparison of ideas and the discovery of relations between them. Simple ideas consist merely of sensations compared one with another. Simple sensations involve judgments, as do the complex sensations which I call simple ideas. In the sensation the judgment is purely passive; it affirms that I feel what I feel. In the percept or idea the judgment is active; it connects, compares, it discriminates between relations not perceived by the senses. That is the whole difference; but it is a great difference. Nature never deceives us; we deceive ourselves.”",
