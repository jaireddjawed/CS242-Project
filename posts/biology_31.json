I have always loved studying anatomy, and being a TA for my anatomy class, and I excelled at learnign the body structures, and memorization techniques. \n\nI was wondering how I could go from here as a BS in Biology to perhaps an anatomy/bio educator. Do I have the ability to teach at a community college? \n\nAny insight on this is greatly appreciated!",

I posted about my YouTube channel a few months ago and wanted to do a follow-up especially with the start of the Spring Semester. It has been officially 1 year since I started and I have made videos covering O Chem 1 and 2, Gen Chem 1 and 2, Biology, Physics, Thermodynamics, Physical Chemistry, Biochemistry and MCAT prep. I now have over 160 videos!! Every video comes with free notes and a transcript. I have grown to over 2100 subscribers (a big thank you to this reddit page for that). I just want to share my channel in case anyone is taking those courses and needs help! I just want to make education accessible and I am willing to help anyone who needs it (message me here or email me)!! Here it is and if you like what you see, please share &lt;333 ALSO more content coming and I am happy to work on any playlist recommendations \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/@professoreman2289](https://www.youtube.com/@professoreman2289)",

But somehow they're able to maintain the strength of an average/above average male. How? Wouldn't a man without testicles lack testosterone and ultimately be weaker?\n\nSo let's use an average 17 year old, 5'10 &amp; 150lbs male as an example. If his testicles were cut off, and he didn't receive any hormone injections, would he lose muscle mass and become physically weaker and less athletic, falling short of the strength of an adult? Would he perhaps become weaker than the average woman over a couple of months or years?\n\nAgain, I know it's a weird question, but I'm being serious.",

I have no idea how to use the microscope, and am embarrassed to ask at this point. I feel like dumb and like a burden to my lab partners.\nAnyways, I have a lab where I’m supposed to be looking at human tissue slides under a microscope, drawing, and then labeling the type of epithelial,connective, and muscle tissue of various body parts. The different types of tissues are so much easier to identify in images online, but when I’m staring into a microscope I just blank. How can I improve at identifying things in a microscope? My professor said that’s what most of the labs are and I really want to be a better lab partner. Are there any resources that I can use to prepare me for this lab and upcoming labs? Any advice is appreciated, studying tips, note taking tips, etc. 🙌🏻💞 i need all the help I can get😮‍💨",

So I'm trying to wrap my mind around  the logic behind encouraging/convincing a child to go through with this and justifying it by saying they should express who they really are. Yet also encouraging them to suppress expressing this newly found freedom of expression of self. Perhaps I'm simple missing something  but is there a single bit of logic to this?",

        "text": "My friend and I are both biology majors and we came to seek answers from those who are experienced or experts in Biology to help clarify this debate. This issue is whether there are only two sexes or multiple.\n\nI argue there are multiple because sex chromosomes can go beyond just XX and XY, some people are born with both sex characteristics (for example, a vagina and testes) proves that sex is not as binary (simply male or female) as people want it to seem (unfortunately, there is always going to be a \"but\"). Some people can be born with XXY, XXX, etc. so it's not as simple as just \"XX\" or \"XY\".\n\nMy friend argues there are only two sexes and intersex should not count as the third sex for two reasons:\n\n1. **Intersex is an abnormality of chromosomes**. This means humans are not supposed to be born outside the male or female category but there's no denying that it happens. When a baby is born, the doctor will look at their genitals to determine their sex. Obviously, a penis and testes mean the baby is a boy, while a vagina means a girl, but if a person is born intersex, it can become complicated. However, doctors will usually offer the mother and father a choice to make the baby a boy or girl by performing surgery on the genitals and providing the child with hormones.\n2. **There has never been a third species evolving**. As far as reproduction is concerned, there have only been two identified gametes that evolved which are male and female. Intersex being a third sex would require them to have their own gametes but they are using a *combination* of male and female gametes but not necessarily having their own so it doesn't count likely because it would create an inconvenience for adults trying to have a baby since they will require 3 (male, female, and intersex), not 2 (male and female), people of the opposite sexes to conceive a baby.\n\nSo we're looking to see if perhaps an expert who has additional knowledge can step in and tell us which of the two is correct and explain using their expertise.",

        "text": "I find extremophilic organisms fascinating due to the versatility of their uniqueness. Specifically pertaining to the medical field (bio-products useful for antibiotics, anti-tumor, etc...) The reason I ask about the prevalence of extremophilic PhD programs is because my goal is to pursue an MD/PhD, but I am not sure this would be possible if these PhD programs are only found at select universities. I understand that Microbiology would be available to me anywhere I went, but would this specific subsection of microbiology be available to pursue further? I guess I'm just asking how common is this subspecialty in the microbiology arena of PhD programs, and would it be feasible to undertake as an MD/PhD student?\n\nThank You!!",
