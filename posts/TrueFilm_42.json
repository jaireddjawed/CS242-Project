        "text": "First of all, this movie aged terribly. Its supposedly \"progressive\" politics are a bit laughable now, especially the way they made Sydney Poitier's character so successful and made it a big point in the plot. So what, if he would be a regular Joe instead of Henry Ford of medicine, he wouldn't deserve white people's approval? He's supposed to do meaningful work that helps humanity, but what about her? We never learn anything about her personality or interests, what she pursues or studies, she's just a liberal pretty girl in a dress. The preaching with a message of hope for the end of racial segregation is also kinda comical: everyone is crying because of how powerful and true the white guy's big final speech is.\n\nBut what I would also like to note is how its aesthetic completely betrays the content. The themes of the movie are very current, it catches the wave of the American Civil Rights Movement, it's real, it's political, it's about the now, the then-now. Yet the movie released in 1967 is shot like any studio movie in the 50s - no real sets, just decorations with matte paintings of the city and sunsets, high stylization sometimes, almost like a Douglas Sirk movie, the camerawork is stilted and the whole feel of it is theatrical. I think this subject matter required something less old-fashioned, more radical and alive. The conflict of ideas, of generations, of Americas should be felt in every aspect of the film. \"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf\" would be my go-to reference: it's from the same era, its powerful style supports the story and the emotions are swirling in the filmmaking as a whole, not just in the lines actors are reading. Shooting a social, political drama like a melodrama was simply absurd.",

        "text": "I'm talking about films like Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, Annihilation and everything in between: films that are touted as contributing to a new renaissance of thoughtful and intelligence science fiction films, whose box-office failures are a fault of dumb audiences who are only interesting in action films. These are films made for a more sensitive and college-educated 20-something crowd who read an excerpt from something by Nietzsche once. Real \"slow-burn\" (hate that term now) explorations of human nature bullshit. Blah blah blah. \n\nI realize I sound like pretentious ass but I really just never seem to understand the critical praise for this string of recent \"intelligent\" sci-fi films. \n\nI just saw Annihilation so I'll talk briefly about that but all these recent sci-fi films have similar problems. \n\nThe dialogue is just awful: uninteresting, unrealistic, overly expository of the most basic things (this is how cell division works, this one cuts herself to feel alive, etc). \n\nThe characters are dull as shit: overly moody and morose, kind of one-note. And the acting is lacking any depth. But with such amateurish dialogue, it's hard to blame them for that. \n\nA story involving a bunch of dumb scientists making dumb decisions and ignoring all possibly safety protocols or even basic logic (yeah I get that they're all losing their minds but Apocalypse Now did that, too, better, and those characters weren't even scientists). A story about a strange phenomenon that's been kept secret for years, somehow, even though countless people have been sacrificed into this thing and nothing was learned from it. A story that tries so hard to not actually be about the science fiction elements because it's too good for that, right? The sci-fi is just a backdrop to explore themes of identify, self, relationships, self-destruction, etc. Who cares that any attempt at an explanation is so childish. It's a bit insulting to the genre, frankly. And it undermines the entire film. \n\nI could go on. Seriously, so many of these \"masterpiece gems\" of sci-fi films to come out in the last few years have just been disappointing, try-hard, amateurish, nonsensical, or just straight up overrated just because they're different and \"slow-burn.\" I guess the opposite also happens when films like Fury Road are praised to high heaven for anything other than the set pieces. I don't know, this came off as more ranty than I wanted but something needs to be said about these sci-fi films that everyone thinks are so clever and deep because they present interesting ideas wrapped around a shitty narrative and just a bad execution of those ideas.

        "text": "**MINOR SPOILERS**\n\nWell after almost 4 years, i finally got to see Xavier Dolan's Mommy. It was not easy to find here in the US, plus i thought the copies i had which were not widescreen were not correct.  I did not know this was intentional by Dolan.\n  \nI later learn this is his unique method of breaking the 4th wall i guess? (when it first happens, Steve literally widens the screen with his hands). When things go well, it expands to wide screen, and then back when things are not so well. Interesting addition. Anyways, i think Dolan is amazing, the standard he has set at his age is remarkable IMO. Some of his subject matter may not be for everyone but i highly anticipate each of his films.\n\nThe two actresses are wonderful and Antoine-Olivier Pilon is superb....such a young actor. Dolan seems to always have some powerful montage/music scenes and this does not lack those. Some of the songs chosen are a little questionable IMO lol but still quality. The dancing scene in the kitchen was very enjoyable, brings a smile to your face.  \n   \n\nAll the characters obviously experienced turmoil and you could see it even though you may not know the details. For example Kayla clearly had issues with her husband and family though these were not specified.  Perhaps it was from her moving all the time and not feeling at home. Also the scene with her necklace and Steve showed she had experienced loss. However, she found her escape with the dysfunctional mother and son, even if it was just for a brief time. The \"dream\" sequence the mother has is also very powerful. Something that will probably never be. Overall, it was worth the wait. Next i need to see is Juste la fin du monde. Thanks for reading.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/80phvf/food_in_the_films_of_haneke_spoilers/",
        "text": "A quick preface - I've been a fan of Michael Haneke for a while now, least not of all because in each of his films that I have watched, he delivers at least one jaw-dropping moment. So far I have watched these:\n\n*Benny's Video* (1992)\n\n*Funny Games* (1997)\n\n*Hidden (Cache)* (2005)\n\n*Amour* (2012)\n\nWhat stood out to me in *Benny's Video* was a particular scene involving food. From then on I began to notice a pattern appearing in each film that I watched. Here I will briefly outline what I have identified. \n\nHaneke frequently uses food in two ways - directly after something traumatic or as a precursor to something traumatic.\n\n\n**After Traumatic Events**\n\nAs I said, I first noticed this in *Benny's Video*, in the scene immediately after Benny has killed the girl with the bolt gun. He goes to the kitchen and he eats yoghurt. He goes back to bedroom, removes bloodied bedsheets and then returns to the kitchen. He continues to eat yoghurt and drinks milk. I found this particular scene very powerful, more so than the murder itself. It unsettled me greatly and watching Benny eat dairy after what he had done made me feel incredibly nauseous.\n\nI'm sure many people have noticed that the actor who plays a young Benny, then appears as an adult, Paul, in *Funny Games*. Note: I'm certain now that *Funny Games* is in fact a sequel to *Benny's Video*. Played by the same actor, the characters are both indifferently cold and maybe most importantly, they both have an appetite after murder. \n\nIn *Funny Games* both Paul and Peter/Tom mention food and hunger numerous times during the home invasion. Most notably, moments before the living room execution (with the infamous lingering wide shot) where Paul goes to the kitchen to make some food. At the end of the film, Paul pushes Anna off of the boat to drown. When asked why he did it, he says that he is getting hungry. \n\nThese two examples stand out, the juxtaposition of murder with something so routine as eating is stomach turning. The murders are gruesome and the fact these characters can eat immediately after makes everything so much worse.\n\nIn *Funny Games*, after the son is murdered, Anna vomits in the hall way. Interestingly, Georg does not. Minutes later as he attempts to dry the kitchen phone he begins eating bread. This didn't fit with what was happening around him.\n\nSimilarly in *Hidden (Cache)* when Pierrot has gone missing, Georges attempts to eat. The food looks very similar to what is prepared and eaten in *Funny Games*, yet this time the character breaks down in tears.\n\nWhile the normality of eating for the murderers exacerbates their actions demonstrating a complete lack of remorse, of emotion, of humanity, for Georg and Georges it is a semblance of normality or routine they seem to be desperately trying to grasp. \n\n**Before Traumatic Events**\n\nIn *Benny's Video* we have the images of a pig being killed on a European farm, presumably for meat, which inspires the girl’s death.\n\nIn *Hidden (Cache)* we see the images of chickens being decapitated, nothing out of place really on a farm where animals are used for meat, which mirrors Majid later in the film cutting his own throat. The family are often eating before receiving a video.\n\nIn *Funny Games* eggs are featured at 2 key moments in the film. Ultimately, the eggs are how the men are getting their foot in the door. They do it at the beginning and then at the end as we see them approach their new victims.\n\nIn *Amour* it is at breakfast with boiled eggs where Anne suffers her silent stroke and once she has come to, can no longer pour tea. The eggs in both *Amour* and *Funny Games* seem symbolic of life and death, how quickly it can be taken away, how fragile it is; as Georges cracks his egg and cuts off the top for breakfast, Peter drops all 6 and they crack on the floor.\n\nIn fact in *Amour* food is featured during or just before well over half of the scenes where something distressing or traumatic happens. A few examples: Georges is eating moments before Anne has a fall - this is also the first time he begins to lose patience with her. The uneasy scenes of cutting her food, followed by feeding her in bed - showing her gradual deterioration and eventually being cared for like a child. Drinking coffee while hearing Anne's agitated groans. Attempting to feed her water, before losing his temper and hitting her. Drinking tea while the daughter is crying.\n\nAgain, we repeatedly see the normality of eating, the mundane routine of everyday life contrasted against the horror of these people's stories. For me these scenes were all the more powerful for it.\n\n\nIs anyone able to say whether similar themes or scenes appear in Haneke's other films (like *White Ribbon* for example)?\n\nAre there any other directors who have used food to powerful effect in their own films?\n\nEDIT: formatting\n",

        "text": "*''My only regret, Anna - but is it only one? - is to not have finished anything. I left all as a draft, shattered words here and there.''*\n\n\nDuring my birthday i decided to watch this film that i had watched when i was a very young lad but didn't quite understand. I read the title of this film on a weekly thread and various pictures crossed my mind. This is the 3rd film from the trilogy of our director(Theo Angelopoulos) called \"Borders\". Winner of Palm d 'Or in a difficult year, with *Life is beautiful* as competition.\n\nThis film presents the last and final border of a man's life, that between life and death. Alexander(Bruno Ganz), is an old writer who is working on an unfinished poem called \"The Free Beleaguered\". He is looking for a linguistic and existential identity and tries to find the words to fill what is missing. He pays people for each word, like the original poet, called \"Dionisios Solomos\" used to do. In his final day of his life, he reminisces his past, a past full of regrets and unfinished work. He thinks about his loved ones that are gone and understands how others will feel when he dies as well.\n\nIn his way to the hospital, he will rescue a young Albanian immigrant, but is it really him that needs to be rescued? The boy, in fact, rescues Alexander. He unveiled all the good that was hidden behind Alexander's bad choices. The child acts like a mirror, reflecting Alexander's life. He completely changes his final moments. Alexander clings to his young friend and delays his departure for a bit. With this random encounter he extends eternity for a day and conveys some of his experience and knowledge to the young immigrant. He leaves his own traces to the kid and through his young gaze he finds redemption. \n\nIt's impossible to understand every detail in this movie. There is an actual border crossing scene where the fences are full of hanged people. The unseen neighbor that answers back with the same music Alexander just played. Three men dressed in yellow cycling in the rain.\n\nThis movie contains one of the most moving scenes i ve ever seen. A long busride where people come and go. You see Alexander and the boy observing a communist(?) that falls asleep, a couple where the man is filled with jealously, three musicians and a ticket collector. Somehow it's trully moving. I was personally stunned.\n\nThe camera is slow, in fact, it is barely moving. The scenes are long and the cinematography beautiful. Bruno Ganz(Alexander),  Isabelle Renauld(his wife) and Achileas Skevis(the young boy) are all having excellent performances.\n\nA true masterpiece, a legacy that this wonderful director left us. Theo, due to his nationality was doomed to never become popular. Although, one of the most influential directors, he died relatively unknown.\n\n*Why, mother, nothing happens as we wish? Why? Why does one have to rot in silence torn between pain and desire? Why did I live my life in exile. Tell me mother, why can't one learn to love?*",

        "text": "Intro\n\n2017 ended with such a bang, so many good titles coming out toward the end of the year, I was in the theaters constantly. There was so much to keep track of, with certain 2017 foreign films just now hitting theaters here in L.A., it was tough to keep track of what films were coming up in 2018. There have been a few exceptions that had early trailer buzz, most notably for me is Wes Anderson’s Isle of Dogs, which comes out in a month and I could not be more excited for it, the other major one being Annihilation. \n\nAnnihilation is Alex Garland’s second film, proceeding what was probably my favorite film of 2014, Ex Machina. What made Ex Machina so amazing to me was its balance of heady science fiction themes and technology with great characters interacting with small-scale set leading to some really intense scenes. So my love of his debut film, mixed with my positive feelings toward the trailer with its promise of a really interesting and grand yet tense and grounded world made me really excited. Not to mention that really bizarre piece of score they used for it, I couldn’t get enough of that. \n\nClearly, Paramount was a fan too because they more than doubled Garland’s budget for this second film, meaning a hard transition away from the close-quarters minimal sci-fi and stepping into the large-scale world building sci-fi. The big question going into this film was could Garland make such a huge change in style while still retaining the sophistication of themes and the intensity of his more active scenes. \n\nBroad Strokes (Spoiler Free)\n\nThe concept and visuals of The Shimmer, despite initially coming from the novel source material, is really conducive to the film medium. It just has mystery to boot. You, as an audience member, want to know what’s at the center of The Shimmer almost as bad as the characters do within the film. Not to mention the conceptual science backing The Shimmer gives the effects and production design team a great jumping off point with unlimited potential. I think in a lot of ways, Annihilation delivers on The Shimmers potential. I was certainly engaged in the mystery up until the end, and there are some wonderful visual ideas at work. When it comes to the world-building aspects, I think Alex Garland transitioned into big(ger) budget sci-fi pretty well, and I think these aspects will make the ticket price worth it for major sci-fi fans. \n\nHowever, I think Annihilation comes up short in many other areas. My biggest issues with the film are basically that despite it being a Suspense Sci-fi Thriller, The suspenseful moments are poorly executed, and the sci-fi themes and ideas are rather shallow and feel well-trodden by the midpoint of the movie. If you have seen the trailers for the film, you have basically seen everything the film has to offer as far as suspense is concerned, which is to say “jump scares” that are either cheesy or jarringly edited. Annihilation usually forgoes the build up these scenes, hoping instead to just catch the audience off guard with a scream or a loud sound effect. The rules this universe operates on are revealed within the hour mark and are not really expanded upon. I will say, the final act of the film is more interesting than the rest, but I think that is largely because it abandons the really tired suspense tropes and the shallow characters and instead goes for something more left field.\n\nWhich leads me to my next issue, the acting and the characters are just really questionable. I'm not sure if it's the way the film is editing or the way it's written, but it keeps cutting between what is happening with the past and the end of the film, which might be what makes it so tough to get behind the characters. Characters behave to strangely and I don't think the film allows for the development of these characters to be rich enough to allow for it. \n\nUltimately, I would not recommend Annihilation. There are admirable aspects of the film, mainly in the world, the Shimmer creates that I like, but the base story and characters make me wish they were part of a better film. Throughout the film, I kept getting tastes of other films, such as Alien, Arrival, Solaris, 2001, and even Prometheus, but I don’t think it’s nearly as good as these films when it came to the ways I found them to be similar. If you are really craving something more in that area of Science Fiction this film will probably have something for you, but I think the film is largely forgettable. \n\n\nNitty Gritty (SPOILERS)\n\nThe major theme I was able to get out of Annihilation was that personality and ego are a product of nature, and like everything else in nature, it is meant to survive as long as possible before returning to the matter that created us. Our self-destructive tendencies are not flaws, but simply accelerate the inevitable final return to where we came from. When characters die in Annihilation, their cells a broken apart and fractured, repurposed for nature. This, of course, is already what happens to us now. When we die, we decompose. We, as we identify ourselves, cease to exist, but the cells that physically make us continue on in a myriad of ways.  The Shimmer allows for this very familiar concept to feel foreign and scary, a strength of the science fiction and fantasy genres.  \n\nTo expand upon the visual ideas I liked, I thought the bear was an interesting application of the splitting cells, particularly how it took on the screams of its prey. Not only was the sound incredibly eerie, but the implications of fusing with that which kills you work so well with what I thought was the major theme of the film. I liked the practical set piece that the women find of the soldier who was cut open on the tape. The way his body was “naturally” spread apart like a fungus or mold was both beautiful to look at, but obviously horrifying if we don’t look at it objectively and instead relate to him as a fellow person. \n\nThe last 20 minutes or so when she actually makes it to the lighthouse are just so bizarre and off the wall that it’s hard not to be allured by it. I like the lack of answers the film’s conclusion provides, it was a brave choice especially since it apparently led to Paramount limiting Annihilation to domestic release only. This was probably when the films feel most original and allow the audience to observe what is going on in a quiet, meditative way, instead of forcing itself upon the audience like I feel like it did for the rest of the film. \n\nAnd as for the rest of the film, I found much of the suspense and character moments forced and lacking any sort of subtilty or nuance. The alligator and bear attack comes out of nowhere with no build-up or tension. The alligator attack is a cheap jump scare, and the bear attack is poorly edited. Everyone is looking around in the dark and then... oops, cut to a woman already grabbed by a bear. People complain about this kind of thing all the time in modern horror movies, I’m not sure why people felt more suspense for Annihilation. I did like the moment where the bear uses the scream of its victim to presumably lure more prey, but the scene leading up to that moment was just too much for me. Are we to believe that Anya just went one by one booping the women in the face with her gun and successfully tied them all to chairs? This scene just felt so damn inevitable, just like… of course, this has to happen. The scene on the canoes where Cass goes one by one and explains these two-dimensional characters to us feels so weak. Yes, I understand how self-destruction plays into the larger theme of the film, but think about how this was presented in the film. It was either explained to us plainly or in Lena’s case, it’s shown in flashbacks. It barely presents itself within the “present” action of the film or in character moments we can see for ourselves.\n\nWhich leads me to my last huge issue, what was the deal with the flash forwards and flashbacks? Was the interrogation scene really that important that we had to stop everything for it multiple times? It feels as if it served no purpose, and often times explained something that we were about to see for ourselves anyway. I feel similarly about the flashback scenes to Lena cheating on her husband, but at least something was happening then. It feels as if they weren’t confident in how the “present” scenes edited together, so these were cut in as an afterthought. The result of which kills the pacing and understanding of how character motivations progress. \n\nLoose, Nitpicky Thoughts (SPOILERS)\n\n-Who, under 40, still has the lockets with the picture in them? This comes up twice in the film. \n\n-I liked when Lena jokes about not “pining” for her husband while he’s gone, it seemed like the film was poking fun at how Lena acts for the first 20 minutes or so. For what purpose? I’m not so sure.\n\n-There are like two separate moments in this film where they watch the footage back on a camcorder, and the footage seems to be edited or something? That’s not how camcorders work. \n\n-I really liked when the first entered The Shimmer and they wake up having forgotten the last few days. This was the first moment where I felt engaged in the film, a very mysterious idea. However, for whatever reason, this never ever comes up again. It seems to be in the film purely for plot convenience sake. \n\n-How did Kane get home? Why does he have that accent? \n\n-The Shimmer fracturing and reflecting cells is an interesting idea, but it feels most fully explored by the time Lena and Josie make the discovery.\n\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nThere are ideas and visuals I liked in Annihilation, but the execution prevented me from relishing in them whatsoever. Clearly, this film is a hit with critics but I myself could not get into it. I’d be curious to hear your thoughts, particularly if you DID like Annihilation because there are a lot of major portions of the film that I think are generally viewed as poor filmmaking. I currently have it at a 5/10, which is to say that I would say that I didn’t enjoy it for the most part, despite there being some admirable qualities.   ",

        "text": "There are 5 short films nominated for this year's live action short film Oscar.  4 are quite similar in their subject matter. They range from: a deaf child struggling with an unsympathetic family, a Christian woman taking a risky journey through a land occupied by Muslim terrorists that aim to do her harm, an active school shooter who finds a compassionate voice in a school secretary, and a retelling of Emmett Till's uncle in the last day of Emmett's life.  \n\nEach of these movies sound distinct in their content, but when viewed together, they stick together to form a clear impression of the preoccupations of the selection panel.  Each of these films tells an unabashed story dealing with a current political or social issue often from the prospective of a marginalized (i.e., deaf, Christian, black, and mentally troubled) protagonist.  This is not a new trend.  In 2016, the winner of the live action short Oscar was a film titled \"Stutterer,\"  which told the story of a young man dealing with a speech impediment while nervously planning his first meeting with an online acquaintance.  \n\nThe first problem with Stutterer, and the problem with four of this year's Oscar nominees, is that since the protagonist is dealing with an disability or is a marginalized member of society, they are treated with white gloves.  The characters have no apparent flaws and, as a result, they lack the dimensions of real people.  Secondly, with characters like this, pity and empathy are the primary engines for forming a connection with the audience.  This effectively lets the screenwriters off the hook for characterizing their protagonists with any admirable or interesting qualities.  As an audience member, you have to care about a protagonist like those shown in many of the Oscar-favorite short films, or else you risk feeling like an asshole. \n\nThe second problem with films like this, is that it seems that the story content alone is the basis for their favor with critical bodies.  Very few of the recently nominated shorts have unique cinematic qualities to fall back on.  For instance, the cinematography for the Silent Child, the aforementioned story of a deaf child struggling with her unsympathetic family, feels inappropriate for the material with aerial shots reminiscent of a luxury car commercial.  Stutterer was also problematic, with an entire sequence composed wholesale of trademark Wes Anderson camera movement. \n\nThe glimmer of hope in all of this is this year's wildcard nominee, The Eleven O'Clock, a comedy of convincing performances, sharp costume design and a very unique visual look.  This film has a snowball's chance in hell at collecting this year's Oscar, (I personally don't see any film other than My Nephew Emmett winning) and that's a shame.  It's a very compelling film because it's a complete package.  It's an engaging story that uses performance and dialogue to win the audience and wraps it all in a package composed of unique cinematic elements.  \n\nI cannot say the same for the remaining nominees.  I fear their selection was due far less because of their cinematic virtues and more because those who selected them felt better about themselves for choosing stories about disadvantaged people and topical subjects.\n\nWhether you agree or disagree, I would love to hear your thoughts on this topic.

        "text": "So, to preface this, I am not a film scholar, nor am I a native english speaker. Please do excuse my terminology, and feel free to correct me when needed. I am writing this because I had a media class recently where the topic of genre was considered, and how it extends beyond a single medium, but what caught my interest was how genre is socially defined, rather than following strict definitions. \n\nNow, genre is kind of a strange subject, because while we as a society has our definitions, it is still quite subjective. Genres are expectations, frameworks, but it is ever changing and may vary from person to person. \n\nI came across a discussion in /r/movies, where people were arguing over whether Star Wars was science fiction or not. I recalled a quote by Ray Bradbury, an author commonly known as a sci-fi writer, stating that the only science fiction book he ever wrote was Fahrenheit 451. His argument was, that it was the only book that was feasible - it was the only book that could potentially happen. This is interesting to me, because in all honesty, I always considered the Martian Chronicles science fiction, and it is my understanding that this is generally the idea. I do not, however, consider Star Wars fantasy. This post is not meant to cement my idea of what science fiction is, but rather to consider expectations. If someone asked me to go see Star Wars, and told me it was a science fiction movie, I think I would be annoyed. Not because they are bad movies, but because beyond the immediate subject material, they do not *feel* like science fiction movies. \n\nThis is not a bad thing. This has to do with my expectations. In my opinion, one of the greatest science fiction directors is Tarkovsky. Solaris (1972) and Stalker (1979) *feel* like science fiction, because of the pondering of humanity, the pacing, the philosophical considerations. Science fiction does not have to be bleak, but in my opinion, it has to ask questions that are difficult to answer in contemporary movies. \n\nAnother example, something that I find a tad annoying, is the term \"slice of life\". It is not that it is wrong - in fact, I oftentimes struggle to sufficiently describe the genre of movies such as Boyhood (2014), Florida Project (2017), Frances Ha (2012) beyond that description. The term \"slice of life\" has in my opinion, however, become meaningless. To paraphrase a user on /r/movies, \"All coming of age movies are slice of life\". This made no sense to me. Still I struggled to define the genre myself, beyond the wikipedia definition, and I realized, that genre to me is more than a set of rules, but rather a mood I put myself into when watching a movie. \n\nWhen I watch a science fiction movie, I am ready for a slow burn of wonder. When I watch a fantasy movie, I am ready for an adventure. When I watch a slice of life movie (see, now I'm doing it), I am ready to be dropped into someone else's life, without necessarily feeling the need for it to go anywhere specific. \n\nSo we land back a subjectivity. Is it wrong for the user over on /r/movies to consider coming of age, slice of life movies? Or is that just the mood he wants to be in when watching them?\n\nSorry this became so long, but honestly I could continue from here. I will let you guys go now though. What does genre mean to you? Does it even matter?",

        "text": "I just watched Loveless by the director Andrey Zvyaginstev and wanted to create a discussion thread since there is little talk of this movie on Reddit. Here is my opinion:\n\n“Loveless” presents us with a cold and cruel environment, where its characters seem to have lost all accounts of civility. It depicts humans and relationships at their worst and how that negativity and hate impacts not only themselves, but also those around them. \n\nThis is my first Zvyaginstev film, or my first Russian film for that matter. It’s been a while since I’ve watched a Fincher movie, but this movie reminded me of him and Gone girl specifically in terms of form but also in terms of athomsphere and plot(a lot of it is probably due to the forest scenes and also the cold winter that both movies takes place during). \n\nI quickly realize that this movie was indeed not about the child, at least not directly. It feels more like a “commentary” or intrusive look into a modern day relationships and marriages than it does anything else. And while never personal or anything more than observing, the ultimate content of the film is very pessimistic, portraying a relationship that is ultimately without any redeeming quality. In the end, we are left with a couple scenes that to me seem to suggest that the same cycle might just get repeated again, not the running away child necessarily but the loveless environment that Boris’ new child seems to find himself in. A horrifying look into the nature of separation and divorce that no doubt many children go through.\n\nWhat did you think of it? Personally, I really liked it but I would love to hear people's opinion on it. Also, I can't help but notice the amount of screen time that technology and Russian politics gets, the latter of which I am completely unfamiliar with, unfortunately, what was Zvyaginstev trying to say here?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/80bn01/black_panther_similarities_with_novel_home_front/",
        "text": "I will discuss surprising thematic resemblances between the movie **Black Panther** and a 1986 book, **Home Front**, written by Patti Davis. The book is about the daughter (Beth Canfield) of a successful politician who is Governor of California (Robert Canfield) and supports the Vietnam War. The daughter opposes the war, and falls in love with a Vietnam veteran (Greg).\n\n**The Powerful, Conservative Leader confronts Foreign Policy Dilemma**\n\nBoth stories feature an up and coming conservative leader of the world's most powerful country who confronts a foreign policy dilemma involving a powerless group far away. In Black Panther, it's T'Challa, who wants nothing other than to be a great King like his father, T'Chaka. The foreign policy dilemma is that Wakanda's isolationism is being challenged by outside forces, particularly Killmonger, who is angry that Wakanda abandoned him because he was an African American. In Home Front, it's Robert Canfield, a thinly veiled allusion to Patti's father, Ronald Reagan, who is on the verge of becoming president. The foreign policy dilemma is whether or not Governor Re--err Canfield, will support the Vietnam War or the protestors against it.\n\n**The Progressive Female Activist Who the Leader Loves Tries to convince him to Change Course**\n\nIn Black Panther, Nakia is first seen rescuing kidnapped women/children from warlords and pushes T'Challa to share Wakanda's resources and technology with the outside world. She is the ex of T'Challa but he still loves her. In Home Front, Beth joins an anti-Vietnam War group and uses her status as the Governor's daughter to speak out against the war. She is the daughter of Governor Canfield and he still loves her.\n\n**The Broken, Damaged Solider Who Represents the Impact of the Policy**\n\nIn Black Panther, it's Killmonger, who is out for revenge because \"the world took everything away from me.\" In the end he is broken, with no mission except to destroy and dominate. In Home Front, it's Greg, Beth's lover, who is shown as normal at first but after six months in combat in Vietnam he becomes very invested in getting revenge for his comrades who have been killed. After signing up for a second tour of duty, he comes home traumatized from all he has seen, and goes into hiding in the woods, unable to deal with society or love Beth any more. Both of them are portrayed as having legitimate grievances.\n\n**The Broken Soldier is Used to Illustrate the Moral of the Tale**\n\nIn Black Panther, Killmonger's destruction is used to convince T'Challa to end Wakanda's isolation and adopt Nakia's viewpoint. In Home Front, Greg's psychological unravelling is used to validate Beth's opposition to the Vietnam War.\n\nThere are, of course, key differences-- Killmonger dies while Greg lives and starts to recover, becoming an activist himself. T'Challa changes while \"Governor/President Canfield\" never does. But the thematic arc of the two stories is the same. And T'Challa is the main character in Black Panther not Nakia; whereas Beth is the main character in Home Front, although arguably the book would not have been written without the real life version of her father, President Reagan.\n\nWhile the writers of Black Panther probably weren't cribbing from Home Front, the thematic arcs of the two stories are essentially (and surprisingly) similar.",

His films have become creatively redundant and somewhat lazy, yet his directing has strangely somewhat improved. In Wonder Wheel, for example, there is wonderful use of color, not only as eye candy, but symbolically (A Single Man by Tom Ford also comes to mind). Maybe it's because of Vittorio Storaro and not Allen, but the change is too obvious for me. The films also feel much more fluid than his other efforts at the beginning of the century, the editing is tighter and doesn't allow much 'empty space'. Maybe it's just me, but I think Allen at 80 years old is still evolving.",

The director could somehow manage, control, and capture these three bratty children whose acting seemed so natural, at times it felt almost like observational cinema (or even documentary style). BUT, at the same time, every piece of the directing felt completely planned out, executed carefully, and shot visually similar to a Wes Anderson film. There's this weird duality of conventional and art-house filmmaking.\n\nIn the story there is also this duality between reality and fantasy. The story is about a young abusive mother trying to care for her daughter, and right off the bat we see the effects of bad/neglected parenting. In the end (((spoiler))) the mother loses custody of her daughter. The kids are free to run around their picturesque fantasy land unsupervised, and (((spoiler))) they accidentally burn down a house; there are very real consequences. \n\nThe setting is very important to this effect. The family stays at a motel called The Magic Castle, painted bright purple and yellow, right down the street from Disney World. The state of Florida itself is green, sunny, overrun with lively vegetation and popping with colors. The kids see it as a magical land of no consequences, while their mother has to live in poverty and deal with the --very real-- consequences. \n\nThis was such a well done film, and it holds up to its name - this really does feel like a *project* on Florida. My only criticism is that there was not ONE alligator, but that's really it. The ending shot was a done a little weirdly, but they were choosing to run TO the castle, embracing fantasy, rejecting reality. I'm kind of upset this isn't a nominee at the Oscars this year. This was one of the most unique films I've seen in a long time.",

Even if I disagree with him on a review, I don't find myself thinking he is in any way condescending or arrogant towards film audiences or other critics. He has great insights into movies and he is also someone who is clearly very intellectual AND emotionally invested in movies. I like (not love) the reviews of Dan Schneider for different reasons. For the movies he thinks are great, he has insight that other critics don't have. But he seems to like movies on a purely intellectual basis. When I read his reviews, I sometimes get the feeling he has some kind of checklist he has to grade movies. He tends to dismiss any critic who has a different opinion than him--he dismisses movies like Mulholland Drive as being \"silly\", doesn't like Luis Bunuel, Godard, etc. If a critic disagrees with his reviews, they are a \"bad critic\". For those of you who have read him, what are your thoughts?\n\nhttp://www.cosmoetica.com/Cinegreatfilms.htm",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI run the subreddit /r/AfricanCinema and am also Africa Editor for a website called Cinema Escapist, which publishes analysis of the geopoliticals, culture and history of films not in the English language.\n\nI've most recently written a long thinkpiece about the impact \"Black Panther\" might have on the cinema of the African Continent and Diaspora. I think I've pretty reasonably justified writing about a commercial mainstream film in the english language, and would love if anyone interested would read it over at: https://www.cinemaescapist.com/2018/02/black-panthers-success-means-african-cinema/\n\nThis subreddit was so helpful when I started up /r/africancinema and I'd love to hear people's thoughts on the subject. To sum up my argument:\n\n- Black Panther's incredible success is the most significant demonstration that films and creative talent need diversity if the film industry is to flourish financially and maintain cultural impact\n- African Cinema has so much to offer but is severely hampered by poor exhibition and distribution models\n- Black Panther is not a perfect film but its effort to present a forward-thinking portrayal of Africa is admirable; African filmmakers can do better, but until they have enough critical and commercial clout across the world to do so, they have to learn from others.\n- African filmmakers and film industries need to learn from their African American counterparts in order to achieve financial success outside of the continent and diaspora, but from my personal experience they have actively refused to do this in the past\n- Black Panther is a piece of genre filmmaking, but on a big-budget scale; one of the best ways for African films to start to break out into international markets is to create more Sci-Fi and Horror films that are distinctly and authentically African. These genres have rabid niche audiences and this would be a good start.\n- Many African films and film industries are self-sustaining and inward-looking. This is not necessarily something I am criticising, but Black Panther has exposed people on a surface level to the storytelling potential of Africa like no other mainstream film perhaps ever, and now is the perfect opportunity for African Cinema to capitalize on its popularity and the cultural conversations it has incited. There is always going to be a place for the likes of Nollywood films, and independent, sophisticated, complex arthouse films that will do well on the festivals and awards circuits, but to do that on a more successful scale, Continental African filmmakers, executives and film industries need to think about how to achieve crossover appeal and transcend cultural boundaries in order to introduce more of the world's audiences to what they have to offer.\n\nI imagine some of the statements I've made in my article will be inaccurate, or generalizations, and are ripe for criticism and feedback which I welcome.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/804agf/they_live_john_carpenter_1988_beyond_carpenters/",
        "text": "I just re-watched the cult movie \"They Live\". I think that, beyond the first layer of interpretation (literal), and the second layer (metaphor for a socialist fight), there is a third *unintended* layer (a criticism of ideological goggles).\n\nOn a surface, literal interpretation, the movie is about an alien attempt to take over humanity by infiltrating it and corrupting it. The attempt is foiled when drifter John Nada sacrifices his own life to destroy the special signal which the aliens used to influence the humans and to disguise themselves among them.\n\nHowever, there is a (very obvious) second layer of interpretation, according to which the movie is a metaphor for the rebellion of the working classes against exploitation by the forces of greed. The special truth-glasses (using which the wearer can view hidden messages in advertisements: OBEY, MARRY AND REPRODUCE, CONSUME, etc.; and can spot aliens) grant knowledge of good and evil: of social injustice. And these glasses are, to the movie-world, what the movie itself is supposed to be to the real-world. This is how Carpenter talks about his movie in interviews.\n\nBut there is a third layer, I believe, which is not intended by Carpenter, but which is made possible by Carpenter's own naive approach to his subject. Indeed, Carpenter was so focused on his own ideological view that he did not realize that his own movie functions as a metaphor for other revolutionary movements. Recently, neo-nazis claimed the movie was about the aryan fight against the international Jewish-conspiracy. This is not what Carpenter intended, but... it actually is a good match (the aliens represent the neo-nazi stereotype of the jew, greedy, sneaky, controlling the media, etc). When watching the movie, I thought of radical islamic terrorism. And this, too, is an excellent match: the glasses are the Quran, etc.\n\nSo the movie functions equally well as a socialist propaganda piece, as a nazi propaganda piece, as an islamist propaganda piece. I think one may find yet more interpretations. For instance in a communist country, with a few cosmetic changes, the movie could serve as propaganda for a *liberal* or even a *capitalistic* revolution: free the media from the apparatchiks etc. The plot and the symbolism of the movie are overall not specific to any revolutionary ideology. That's not intended; rather, it is a result of Carpenter taking a simplistic, uncritical, manichean, ideologically extremist view, and failing to realize his own ideological glasses were just one pair among many. And thus he made a movie that captures the essential characteristics of such glasses:\n\n* A division of the world into the good guys (=humans, working classes, aryans, muslims, the alt-right, the alt-left...; \"the victim group\") and the bad guys (=aliens, greedy capitalists, jews, the west, the liberals, the neoliberals...; \"the oppressive group\").\n* An external explanation for any personal problems. If Nada is struggling, it is not due to any flaw in character or abilities, but because of the foreign invasion of media-controlling aliens.\n* The acceptation of strong peer pressure as a substitute for reasoned discourse. Sure, this is in part because Carpenter is a talented *action* director, who finds it easier to film a (famously) long fight between friends than an equivalent discussion. But it's not just that.\n* In the end, the justification of extreme violence. John Nada visibly finds much pleasure in perpetrating mass-murder -- after all, his victims are all aliens, not humans! He begins killing them within minutes of putting on the glasses, taking no time whatsoever for critical reflexion; whereas the organized resistance is implicitly criticized for being too slow in doing the same.\n\nI suppose my point is: stop thinking of \"They Live\" as a masterpiece of political cinema. It should be seen at best as an unintended warning against ideological brainwashing.\n\nedit- typos.",

        "text": "Just finished reading [*Robert Altman:  The Oral Biography*](https://www.amazon.com/Robert-Altman-Biography-Mitchell-Zuckoff/dp/0307267687/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1519529720&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=robert+altman+mitchell+zuckoff) assembled by Mitchell Zuckoff.  It's a fascinating collection of (500 pages of) comments by professional acquaintances, friends and family (especially illuminating what he was and wasn't responsible for in nearly each film) - but one of the more interesting tidbits I thought I'd share is the last working project he had going on:  \n\n&gt;At the end we were working on *Hands on a Hard Body*, based on this competition where people try to win a truck by keeping a hand on it longer than anybody else.  A documentary had been made about the real event, but this would have been Bob's take on it.  That would have been something, just having a bunch of disparate characters thrown together in an environment in a prescribed period of time and just seeing how it all shook out.  It was going to be a part revisionist faux documentary but also a commentary on the twenty-four-hour news cycle.  Ultimately I think he would have ended up going into the impact of everyone getting their fifteen minutes of fame.  - David Levy (producer)\n\n&gt;I spoke to him about casting *Hands on a Hard Body* two days before he passed away... We had Chris Rock, Dwayne Johnson, Steve Buscemi, Tommy Lee Jones, Jack White from the White Stripes, Jack Black, Salma Hayek, Billy Bob Thornton, John C. Reilly, Hilary Swank.  Others, too.  And we weren't finished.  - Pam Dixon Mickelson (casting director)\n\n&gt;The story that fits inside of *Hands on a Hard Body* - and what Bob kept going back to - was to watch these people fall apart and what they do when they fall apart.  One person turns on another person, one person is an angel.  It's the theme of all his movies, every single one of them.  He deals with us at our very basic nature.  The good, the bad, and the ugly.  - Wren Arthur\n\n\n&gt;The way Bob described making *Hands on a Hard Body* was sly, original, and sprung from the specific possibilities and problems of making that particular film and that particular story.  The movie was going to be a three-ring circus - at least three rings.  Contests around the car would be the center ring.  But there was also the ring around the truck dealership, its owner, the owner's lieutenant - a woman who ran the contest with an iron hand, to be played by Meryl Streep.  There was a ring of journalists to cover the event, the center of which was the embittered alcoholic toiling for a Texas television news crew, played by Billy Bob Thornton.  There were boyfriends and girlfriends and wives and angry husbands and a contestant who is mistakenly arrested for murder and hauled off the truck by cops.  And there'd be bands playing, hot dogs, cotton candy - Bob's favorite foods.  All these people, over three or four days, would grow almost as tired as the contestants themselves.  A perfect Altman film.  - John Astrachan (producer)\n\nBy all accounts it looks like it would've been another big ensemble project like *Short Cuts*, *Gosford Park*, and *Nashville*.  The real contest it references (I know it's been repeated hundreds of times in every western country, but I mean the original one) in one incarnation ended with a guy taking his hand off the car, walking into a gun shop, and shooting himself in the head.  There was certainly plenty of real life drama around this concept for inspiration.  The themes about amateur fame and reality television would have been very interesting to see from a master filmmaker in general and Altman in particular.  \n\nI wouldn't mind if someone took it up even now, though maybe it would be slightly less prophetic.  I'm not sure how it would be adapted for the Youtube era, or who would do it, but I still like the idea.  \n\nDoes anyone have any more information on the project, or can anyone think of similar films about reality television that have been made since?  Other than the original *Hands on a Hard Body* documentary.  \n\n*Ingrid Goes West* comes to mind for some of the themes, but it's pretty removed from the material.  ",

In fact, it sounds kinda like contemporary music from the time the movie was made, usually with some very heavy-handed 'electronic flourishes'. Because it's the future, after all.\n\n(Recent examples include Mute and Altered Carbon)\n\nThis is a pet peeve of mine that always takes me out of the film, but it's also a challenge I understand is nearly insurmountable for the filmmakers. \n\nBecause how do you create **believable** popular, in-world music from the future? It has to feel alien to us, while still feeling like a natural continuation of what came before it. Could anyone in the 1960s have foreseen dub-step? Or EDM? Or even just rap, a few decades later?\n\nIt's a question I find endlessly intriguing, because I think it's really overlooked part of sci-fi world building that can add so much texture and scope to your film's future. Some films get somewhat elegantly around this problem by having the characters listen to \"20th century classical music\" as part of some motif of retro-nostalgia, but at the end of the day it's a cheat.\n\nEven though it doesn't count since it's not diegetic music that exists inside the film world, Johann Johannson's score for Arrival was one of those moments for me where I genuinely felt like I was listening to something not even close to anything I'd heard before.\n\nDoes something similar exist for in-world music design? I'd love to know which films you think were most successful in creating diegetic music in a future world **and why**?\n\n\n",

And oh boy was that movie a trip, stylistically quite the unique film. I was a bit disappointed that the movie didn't delve into deeper, more classic sci-fi elements and questions. However it did raise some interesting questions such as the humanity of Hari the guest and the validity of the scientific quest for knowledge versus the ancient more emotional, cosmic as Snaut puts it, view of the world.T he movie seemed to be primarily focused instead on the mind and conscience of our protagonist Kris Kelvin and the authenticity of his love for Hari the guest. Kris seemed to represent the more emotional view as he couldn't help but care for and love Hari despite the damage it was doing to the both of them and the logical understanding that Hari was a materialization of his memory created by Solaris. Kris' view is juxtaposed by that of the analytically cold Sartorius who seeks the advancement of scientific knowledge regardless of emotion or morality despite the use of radiation in that vein creating the problems they face in the first pmace. Ultimately the film seems to suggest that total adherence to either view  is damaging and perhaps a more nuanced combination of the two as Snaut seems to suggest would do humanity better. \n\nThe thing that most struck me about this film was Tarkovsky's unique use of visuals to create the emotion and atmosphere for the film. Despite the slow pace and my initial desire for more of a classic Sci-fi Tarkovsky's use of imagery and slow, meditative shots helps to create a surreal, dream like atmosphere thay gradually puts us deeper into Kelvin's mind culminating in the final act which is essentially an unsettling psychedelic trip through Kris' eyes. One of the coolest things about this film to me is that Tarkovsky's meditative style creates an ambiguity that could lead to different  interpretation and feelings unique to the viewer in the same way that Solaris creates unique guests and introspection for the characters of the film. My analysis is largely a surface level analysis of the narrative but I'm sure with more time to unpack the visuals and feelings created by the movie and repeat viewings could lead to various different interpretations. I'm definitely going to have to rewatch this film at some point and look forward to checking out more of Tarkovsky's work, I think I'll watch Mirror or Stalker today.",

The film captures a lot of revelations, and displays perhaps 2 of the greatest performances in the modern era.\n\nAlthough I could follow the subtle emotional and philosophical dynamics between the two characters (disciple and master), I felt like their final scene together left me very unclear about how they feel about each other and what they want from each other.\n\nParticularly near the very end of their conversation, The Master sings a song *\"I want to get you on a slow boat to China, all by yourself, alone.\"* Philip Seymour Hoffman gets visibly worked up, passionate, and maybe even angry while singing this song. It must impact Joaquin Phoenix on some level too, because he sheds a tear for only the second time in the film.\n\nCan any one comment on what may be going on in this last scene emotionally?\n",

        "author": "Elementaryfan",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7zx8qr/lets_discuss_cabaret_balkan/",
        "text": "*Minor spoilers*\n\n\n\"Cabaret Balkan\" is a 1998 Serbian movie. [Not to be mistaken with a Serbian (exploitational horror) movie actually titled \"A Serbian Film\", which, personally, I wouldn't recommend to anyone, and it has nothing to do with this movie.] The original title of \"Cabaret Balkan\" is \"Bure baruta\", which literally translates to \"Powder Keg\" (\"Barrel of gunpowder\"). It doesn't appear to be that well known, but it is a really well made movie; powerful and realistic, really well acted and directed, and it definitely makes for some interesting observations and theories.\n\n\nSome historical context is needed to really understand the movie. It takes place in Belgrade, Serbia, in 1998, the year the movie was made. That is a time period near the end of Yugoslav wars, a series of ethnically-based wars and insurgencies fought from 1999 to 2001, though the deadliest one was Croatian War for Independence, fought from 1991 to 1995. Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia were all involved and suffered large casualties and destruction. As a result, the situation in Serbia (as well as other countries from former Yugoslavia), as portrayed in this 1998 movie, is very bleak, and people are mostly fed up, angry, pessimistic, frustrated, and, often, violent, which leads to numerous conflicts featured in the film. \"Cabaret Balkan\" is a period piece, and it captures that state of affairs extremely well.\n\n\nYou can find it on here, with subtitles (not officially rated, but it is definitely NC-17):\n\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?t=3694s&amp;v=kf6XsreEfmI\n\n\nThe translation is actually pretty good.\n\n\nNow that I got that out of the way, I'd just like to add my thoughts and observations. I've done my best to avoid major spoilers, in case someone decides to see it, but there will be minor ones, of course.\n\n\nWhile watching the movie, you will probably notice is that the most intense and disturbing scenes are the ones where something bad is about to happen (threats, attempted rapes), while actual murders and beatings are often pretty quick, or even take place off-screen. Though that was a great way to mantain a tense, uncomfortable atmosphere that defines the movie, I think that element, too, is supposed to represent the mindset of Serbs at the time. The war is over, but the uncertain future is the next horror. People know what happened to them, and they know that it can happen again. They're on the edge. Hence the original title; they are like a powder keg, the tiniest spark is enough to ignite them and cause a large explosion. Eerily, a year after this movie was made, Serbia was bombed by NATO.\n\n\nThe \"hijacked bus story\" (from 54:20 to 1:08:10) may seem like the most preposterous one, but in my opinion, it is the most poignant and thought-provoking part of the movie. The unnamed \"villain\" of the tale makes a good point; people have to stand up for themselves, make a change, but nobody is brave enough to do that, and that is why they're all in the shitty situation they're in, that is why nothing works out. They just sit around and take it, which is why everything is going to shit. In turn, he makes his victims stand up to him, and, in a way, he succeeds. However, his cruel and disturbing methods instantly made him their enemy, and that \"enlightement\" eventually doesn't end well for him. But he proved his point, either way.\n\n\nOne thing that may bother some viewers is that pretty much all female character in this movie are helpless victims, one way or another, and I'm pretty sure that is supposed to be a criticism of certain prejudices and mentality integrated in Balkan society and culture; only increased by poverty, war traumas, high crime rate, and all the other issues. You can read about it in this pretty good review of the movie, written by late Roger Ebert (warning: major spoilers):\n\n\nhttps://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/cabaret-balkan-1999\n\n\nIt is also worthy to note that none of the main characters just stumble into certain situations that move the plot long; they directly cause them with their actions. The only innocent people in the movie are several collateral victims. The phrase \"Da smo živi i zdravi\" (\"In good health\"), said numerous times throughout the movie, is obviously used irronically. It is a somewhat common sentiment that, no matter how bad things are, there is still hope, as long one is \"alive and healthy\". This movie seems to suggest that, sadly, often times, that isn't enough.\n\n\nVery interesting and disturbing foreign movie, really well acted and directed, and quite thought provoking too. Great period piece that captured the bleak, pessimistic situation in Serbia from mid to late 90s. Unlike \"A Serbian Film\", which is famous due to its gore and explicit violence, \"Cabaret Balkan\" isn't gory nor exploitational, and instead makes an impact with its terrifying realism, disturbing atmosphere and sharp dialogues. \n\n\nAnother pretty good foreign movie dealing with similar themes and issues is 1998 French drama \"I Stand Alone\" (\"Seul Contre Tous\"), written and directed by Gaspar Noe. That movie features and explores struggles of a deeply flawed protagonist (The Butcher), while also studying the end of industrialism and old moral principles in modern France. Gaspar Noe later went on to write and direct a psychological horror drama \"Irreversible\".\n\n\nLet me know if you agree with my observations, what do you think about the movie, and do you have different theories and observations that you'd like to share.",

Upon first watch, one might think that this is just an excuse for Tarantino to get back in his dialogue-writing element. However, the true purpose is eventually made clear: the French-speaking family hiding underneath the floorboards does not understand English, so they are clueless as to what is happening when Landa forces a confession (in English) from the farmer that he is, in fact, hiding and sheltering them.\n\nPerhaps this is a superficial example of the trope that I want to see more of, but I would be lying if I said that I didn’t find Landa’s mastery of multiple languages throughout the film somewhat thought-provoking.\n\nSo, what are some other films that feature language barriers between its characters? Whether it be in just a scene or throughout an entire film as a major thematic element, language barriers is a subject that I would like to see more of in movies.\n\nThank you for your suggestions!",

OP was complaining about how blockbuster movies are downvoted systematically here:\n\n\n&gt;I've noticed a clear trend on this sub to downvote en masse any discussion on a film with mass appeal that is not critically acclaimed or seen as a thoughtpiece. I think this kind of bandwagonning is not healthy for this sub, which encourages in depth discussion on film...\n\n\nI thought it was a really unfair comparison since that kind of movies have plenty of room for discussion in other subs, but just to make myself sure I checked a few posts in order have a more accurate picture.\n\n\nThe numbers are staggering. The top (indeed by far) r/TrueFilm post *of all time* is [YouTube channel \"Every Frame a Painting\" announces its ending](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7h9j5k/youtube_channel_every_frame_a_painting_announces/) with *3367 votes* and *163 comments*. Now compare this with the top post on r/Movies (which is not even a discussion but anyway), [The Senate. Upvote this so that people see it when they Google \"The Senate\"] (http://i.imgur.com/ChYwfMq.jpg), that has *over 349.000 votes* and *4668 comments*, or the top Star Wars post on the same sub, [Official Discussion - Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7jwxnd/official_discussion_star_wars_episode_viii_the), with *over 15.000 votes*, and *more than 103.000 comments*\n\n\nI mean if you think your post about your superhero movie is not well received here you can go definitely somewhere else.  In fact it will receive plenty of attention if you chose the right sub.\n\n\nIt is also interesting looking at the numbers in the same sub, r/Movies, when it comes to relevant and imo interesting directors, those the kind you expect to pop up here in R/TrueFilm. Les't see what happens with three examples:\n\n* Top Dreyer post on r/Movies: [How a Film Made in 1928 is Still Revolutionary: Carl Dreyer’s “The Passion of Joan of Arc”] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1x6omv/how_a_film_made_in_1928_is_still_revolutionary), 58 votes, 17 comments\n\n\n* Bela Tarr, [Director of the Moment: Bela Tarr](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hzi93/director_of_the_moment_bela_tarr), 82 votes, 89 comments\n\n\n* Agnes Varda, [Agnès Varda, acclaimed French filmmaker and oldest Oscar nominee (at 89 years) says her Oscar nomination is nice, but \"nothing to be proud of\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7w47oz/agn%C3%A8s_varda_acclaimed_french_filmmaker_and_oldest), 140 votes, 24 comments\n\n\nObviously Tarr, Varda or Dreyer don't receive the same attention as the last superhero flick post regardless of its “depth” or quality, and yet you have people complaining because mainstream movies are being downvoted in *this* sub which is devoted to in-depth film discussion...\n\n\nWhat is not healthy is to pretend that a sub like this should behave just like those other popular subs that in fact are totally different and have a totally different outlook on films. Claiming that just because a post about Back Panther does not receive the same attention as a post about gender issues in modern filmmaking for example is r/TrueFilm users being unfair, is not only misleading but utterly outrageous considering the situation.\n\n\nThe problem is not that there's not enough discussion about mainstream movies on r/TrueFilm, actually I'd say that there's too much discussion about them here and to pretend otherwise shows a lack of sensitivity. If you want to complain try at least to think about the situation on reddit in general and about the idiosyncrasy of this particular sub.\n\n\nr/TrueFilm is a very interesting place on reddit and is one the few places where you can discuss small little known films or classic filmmakers for example. To try to make it behave and act just like those other popular movie subs is to completely miss the point.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7zvkwo/mother_was_it_a_completely_trashy_attempt_at_a/",
        "text": "I must agree that \"mother!\" is a pretty chaotic film. Aronofsky wanted to include so much in one feature, tell such a huge, immense tale that it basically overwhelmed him.\n\nNonetheless, I took the liberty of cracking down the rich symbolism of the film.\n\nIn “mother!”, it’s not God, who creates – it’s his loving wife, played by Jennifer Lawrence. She’s the one, who piece-by-piece rebuilds the house, ergo creates the world from scratch. Even Javier Bardem’ character emphasizes that by saying “she breathes life into this place”.\n\nFurthermore, God is a writer – he spends days on sweating his mind in order to create a revolutionary poem. It does ring a bell, as it sounds a lot like he’s working on the Ten Amendments, even though we never hear those words in the film. Such theory is backed by the cult following “the writer” and how his words changed people in a very direct manner. Whilst he is trying to focus, it’s his wife who slowly builds the house and takes care of the everyday routine to remain ongoing.\n\nI also liked using fire is a symbol of chaos. It destroys everything, turning it into ash and smoke. When we see riots in the streets, there’s always fire included. And all this mess leads to the final act of burning down the house, God’s house. From chaos, the world is reborn.\n\nBut even more interesting is who rebuilds it. Lawrence’s character is blindly in love with her husband, obeying his orders, however firmly she tries to stand by her opinions. He decides to invite people to his kingdom, although it creates distance between the two of them. He wants attention, he needs to “be” for his followers and not for him. In a way, it is a very disturbing contradiction to the Christian values, which are built on the grounds of family ties. In “mother!”, God could be understood as duplicitous, as if he himself craves the spotlight at all costs. Furthermore, he hurts his wife – even if doing it subconsciously. She’s often left to struggle on her own, faltering among strangers in her own house.\n\nEven more compelling is the answer to the most unimaginable part of the Holy Bible. Why would a father allow his son to be a martyr, patiently observing his slow and painful death? As to my understanding, Aronofsky claims that God never had love for the child in the first place (contradicting the words of the Holy Bible). It’s portrayed in the scene when he allows the crowd to hold the newborn, but also even earlier. He doesn’t want to take care of his wife, because he is more interested in people bringing gifts for them. And her instinct – to protect the child at all costs – is much more human than Bardem’s misplaced sense of higher values. It’s most powerful in one of the last scenes, where the perpetum mobile is revealed – God needs to create and allow it to be destroyed in order to make the circle of life close itself. At the cost of a loving wife and his child.\n\nThis is a shortened version of my analysis.

I was surprised that this movie was actually well under two hours.  It's thought-provoking and sparse in dialogue.  The combination of wonder, beauty, bewilderment, terror, and utter horror, works.\n\nProbably the best movie I can compare this to is the Fountain, one of my favorites.  This movie feels like the Fountain had the goal been to burn the Tree of Life down and to destroy it forever.  At the core of the Fountain was an endearing relationship that, upon the man finishing his quest, lasts forever (so goes my interpretation).  At the core of Annihilation is a relationship that was falling apart and...ended up changing?  Became self-destructive?  It's difficult for me to say.  It would require several more viewings, especially to ensure I heard the dialogue correctly.\n\n\n#Evolution, Life, Death\n\n\nThis movie begins with the standard Darwinian explanation of life, and by the end of the movie, makes you question whether or not the shimmer and everything surrounding it, to include whatever the locus of the shimmer was and the main character herself, was/is actually alive.  What is life?  It's an important question for this movie, as by the end, the interrogator asks if it's a carbon-based lifeform, and doesn't get any answers.  The beginning of the movie notes that the main character does not remember eating, and indeed they don't ingest anything throughout the movie.  I think this is the main point of the movie...a complete and utter deconstruction of life, and to get people to question whether or not anything alive is any more significant than anything that isn't.\n\nThere are several deaths littered throughout the movie, but for some of them, it's difficult to describe as death, especially the Tessa Thompson character, who becomes part of the landscape.  The movie suggests that the shimmer reflects, or perhaps as the movie describes, refracts, the thoughts and feelings of the characters.  This is perhaps most prevalent in the 'death' of the psychologist...we discover she had terminal cancer, and her 'death' ends up in a microcosm of...the big bang?  Eternal recurrence?  Whatever it was, it did not look biological.\n\nAnyway, as a final thought, I just wanted to describe what I did immediately afterward...I went into a Dunkin Donuts, scanned over their selection, and ended up buying a 'Baker's Choice', which was a donut (?) that didn't have a hole, was smothered in white frosting that was still somewhat fluid, and had rainbow sprinkles on it.  It looked like a weird abomination of a donut, like it wanted to be a cupcake or something but no, donut.  I ate this donut, and it was delicious.",

        "text": "I would like to preface by saying I have not read the book so I am judging this movie on its own merit. Also, this is my first post here I don't know if this is nit-picky stuff, I just have been reading a lot of raves about this movie and am looking to discuss some issues that I noticed because I'm certain there will be many discussions of this film's merits, which are certainly there. Overall, I enjoyed it but I couldn't help but feel like I was slightly let down relative to the hype. I look forward to seeing it again and maybe liking it more on the second go.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this film was unsure of what it was trying to be, almost like it was originally going to be more cerebral but the studio told them to make it more marketable? It seems strange to me that a movie so bold and ambitious could also feel unsure of itself. This film has a visual stunning and enigmatic finale that is really quite out there by blockbuster sci-fi standards. You can almost hear Alex Garland begging us to compare him to Kubrick and Tarkovsky through the last act. Yet through the first 2/3 of movie we get kind of a James Cameron/John Carpenter style horror film. Obviously both these forms can be brilliant on their own, but it seems like they had two different ideas for a movie and they got their DNA scrambled and came out a very interesting but deformed creature, not as God intended. \n\nA lot of the dialogue felt clunky, like they didn't trust the audience would understand what was going on unless someone stated it out loud. They find a memory card and a camera, and some says something along the lines of \"We can put it in the camera to watch it\" as if we would be totally lost on what was going on if they didn't tell us they were going to put the memory card in the camera, turn it on and watch the video. At the very beginning a professor is teaching what is apparently a med school oncology course, and she is explaining the basics of cell mitosis like it's the first day of freshman bio.  In terms of the main theme, we are treated to a scene where one character basically says \"We all have trauma that leads us to self destructive impulses\" and then it cuts to each character while the dialogue tells you the background on each character. This was not subtle at all. These early scenes don't seem to match up with the ending that leaves nothing explicitly explained and is masterfully executed in a purely visual way.\n\nOn a different note, I don't want to seem like I'm on a \"modern blockbusters are for idiots with no attention span\" spiel, but I really would have liked for them to have taken their time more letting the mystery unravel. Maybe this is a matter of personal taste because I'm aware of people who complained about the length and pace of Blade Runner 2049, which I never once was thought was slow. Inside The Shimmer is really gorgeous and I wish we would have gotten a chance to soak up the scenery and set pieces here. \n\nI know this is kind of all over the place in terms of content, but I thought there was a lot to discuss. Thanks for reading. What are your thoughts?",

        "text": "For some reason I've been thinking about the 2008 film starring Hilary Swank, Freedom Writers, recently, and I'm not exactly sure why. I saw it in theaters 11 years ago, and I really liked it then, though of course I was in the 8th grade and what you liked in middle school doesn't really count for much. \nI know I've seen it at least once since then, maybe even twice, but I know it's been at least 8 or 9 years since I last saw it. Sometimes things that I liked from years ago creep back up into my thoughts, and I revise what I think of them now based on what I remember from them. \n\nEspecially now more than ever, I'm not a fan of inspirational movies, and I never really think about other inspirational movies I saw from years ago around that same time (such as Gridiron Gang, We Are Marshal, or Pride), so I find it somewhat odd my thoughts will linger for a minute every now and then on Freedom Writers, years after I've seen it. And I also find it odd that to this day, it hasn't really diminished in my initial thoughts, I still think it's a really solid film. \n\nMaybe I've started thinking about it again because I often see it alongside The Blind Side, Radio, The Help, and Dangerous Minds, on [lists about lame \"white savior\" films.](https://amp.www.complex.com/pop-culture/2011/09/the-10-lamest-white-savior-movies/)\n\nThere are some issues I take with Freedom Writers, and it's not a masterpiece, but I find it somewhat unfair that the only reason anybody still remembers it, is because it's being derogatorily compared to The Blind Side or Radio in lists about formulaic white savior movies. Chief among the issues I take with that comparison, is the fact that this white lady savior figure, Erin Gruwell, learns very quickly that she isn't going to save anybody, which is something typical white savior movies never acknowledge. \n\nWhen Freedom Writers begins, we see Erin start out as a stereotypical white savior, a wide eyed white lady who thinks she's going to help all these kids in an inner city school turn their lives around through the power of education, and then, of course, we see her endure discouraging obstacles, there's an embarrassing scene where she tries to relate to them by breaking down some lyrics from a Tupac song, and they all immediately see through her bullshit, she almost gives up, she hits a breaking point that leads into one of those \"white person gets real on those disrespectful inner city school kids' asses\" moments, and then things begin to turn around. \n\nThe second act of typical inspirational movies are always kicked off by a \"turning point\" moment, such as the scene where Erin goes off about how a holocaust happens in her big \"get real\" moment, but, instead of going straight to the stuff where the white lady fixes all their troubles with the power of white culture, and these lazy, undisciplined, disrespectful inner-city kids finally buckle down and apply themselves with the help of their white savior, instead, Freedom Writers starts revealing more details from her student's life stories, and Erin quickly realizes she's not going to save anybody.\n\nWhite Savior movies, throughout all three acts, center the entire movie around the white savior, and their selfless struggle to fix the lives of the colored people around them through the awe inspiring power of white culture, but Freedom Writers, instead, directly acknowledges white culture is the reason these kids deal with the bullshit and the abuse they endure, shifts its focus away from Erin, and primarily focuses on the challenges her students face, and let's them be the center of their personal struggles. Erin's entire developmental arch is resolved in the first act: she realizes she can't fix her students, and the only thing she's able to do is introduce them to people in history and in literature that will help them understand their own situations. And that's all she does throughout most of the rest of the movie, which is the only thing a teacher of abused students really can do. \n\nMost of the rest of the movie is centered around her students relating to other characters and historical figures in the books Erin introduces them to, and it is through relating to those fictional and non-fictional characters, and learning to articulate their own stories through writing, that her students are able to find refuge, and work out the shit life has put them through. But even as the work out and attempt to overcome their own shit, their is no point where anybody is \"redeemed\" or \"saved,\" because by the end they are still surrounded by poverty, abuse, and violence, by the end they just have a few more tools to help them deal with it. \n\nAll that being said, it still is formulaic, it still hits the all of the typical \"inspirational\" beats, it still does have quite a few \"white lady gets real on some inner city school kids\" moments, it is flawed, but I don't think it derogatorily belongs in the \"white savior complex\" category of inspirational movies. If anything, I think it does the \"white savior\" narrative right, in that it isn't about some selfless white person fixing the lives of inner city kids, but instead it's a privileged white woman seeking to use her privilege to introduce underprivileged kids to the stories of other people who can help them understand and articulate their own stories. In other words, it's less a expose of how white culture, white people, and white privilege can save colored students, which is the entire premise of films like The Blind Side, but instead it celebrates the vitality of literature and the power of writing. How reading about other people can help you put your own story into words, and understand the world you are living in. \n\nThis was probably overlong and repetitious, since I'm writing this on a bus from my phone, but thank you for reading it anyways.

        "text": "I saw Annihilation last night and I cannot get this movie out of my head. Nor do I want to. Garland’s newest film is his most challenging yet. The world created in “The Shimmer” is not only a feast for thine eyes, but is also extremely thought provoking. I wanted to generate some thoughts on the themes presented in the movie. Theorizing on the meaning of any subject is welcome as well as tying themes together. I’m planning to see this again as soon as I can, but in the meantime I’d love some input to help digest this dense film.\n\nThe most outward stated theme is that of self-destruction. Ventress outright asks Lena if it’s coded within us to self-destruct. \n\n•\tThe mission they are on should be deemed a suicide mission, but none of them are committing suicide, just self-destructing for various reasons. \n\n•\tLena is having an affair with her co-worker, destroying her marriage. Consequently, causing Kane to accept a mission he knows will probably bring death.\n\n•\tLena ignites the “Alien” on fire, instead of leaving the lighthouse, it goes into the tunnel, the center of the shimmer, causing it’s destruction. Did it self-destruct because it was mirroring Lena, someone who is coded to?\n\nNext is refraction.\n\n•\tJosie states that signals from inside the shimmer weren’t getting out because they were being refracted.\n\n•\tThis leads you to find out that is how DNA is crossing between species, it’s being divided and refracted.\n\n•\tThe design of the shimmer itself is rainbow in color and always flowing. The rainbow coming from the refraction of light. It’s fluidity mirrors what happens to living beings inside.\n\n•\tI’m not sure if there is any meaning behind this, but it’s an amazing shot. When Kane first comes back to Lena they are discussing his disappearance at the kitchen table. On the table is a glass of water, when looking through it, every movement of Lena’s looks like it’s coming from Kane and vice-versa.\n\nThis could be two themes, but they’re so similar it could be viewed as one. The depiction of biology, cell division &amp; cancer in particular.\n\n•\tWe eventually learn Ventress has cancer and is part of the reason she is on the mission.\n\n•\tThe shimmer mirrors exactly what a tumor does to the human body. Mutating as it goes, it grows until the host is dead. (If the being is sentient, was this it’s intention for earth?”\n\n•\tEven after being removed and treated, cancer can come back. Is Kane’s replica able to spread this genetic modification? This leads to another question, if the shimmer is destroyed do all things still living remain the same?  Lena looks at her blood and sees her cells acting different. Does this explain the ending with her eyes, or was that spread to her? I've also heard she could be a duplicate, but we see her killing the duplicate in the lighthouse.\n\nThe book might reveal and explain more, but this is strictly based off of one viewing of the film. If there are more connections or themes bring them up below in the comments. \n",

        "text": "Video Form: https://youtu.be/AsFJvPbG7fI\n\nJohn Wick: Chapter 2 — The Art of Crafting Action\n\nRemember how simple, gritty and awesome classic 80’s action movies were? The first John Wick is a good old revenge flick that reminds us of a simpler time. One of the best action movies of the decade, it felt like a film that was pulled straight out of the Golden Age of Action Movies. Most of the action is in camera and the stunts were pretty well coordinated, as well as having a pretty motivated badass main character played by Keanu Reeves. The movie was a small box office success but the mysterious universe presented in the film left newly spawned fans anxious to learn more. So how did they follow this up in the sequel?\n\nBefore Chapter Two came out, some pretty awesome footage of Keanu’s training with guns was released and left fans anticipating the film even more. And when it finally hit theatres, it definitely didn’t disappoint. It was paradise for action and stunt lovers, hinted at by the opening shot featuring Buster Keaton, the granddaddy of stunt work in film. We already know that John Wick 2 did exactly what it was supposed to do as a sequel: Take what fans loved and expand upon it. But what else did the filmmakers do that made the movie as awesome as it was? \n\nIt’s safe to say that John Wick Chapter 2 was bigger in every way possible. The scope of the universe was expanded, the body count was surpassed and even the length of the movie was longer. But the execution of the action alone makes it stand out as a sequel and feel different enough to not be a rehash of the same ideas. So how did they achieve this? You see, we can separate action movies into three different categories. Let’s call them: \nRealistic\nSemi-Realistic\nUnrealistic or Over the Top\nWe’ll see that every single action movie ever made, from Lethal Weapon to Aliens fits into one of these three categories. Let’s explore them one by one and learn why John Wick Chapter 2 worked so well.\n\nDie Hard, Casino Royale, First Blood and even Aliens fit into the category of Realistic Action. Wait a minute, space marines killing Xenomorphs on an alien planet is realistic? Let us explain. Realistic action doesn’t have to follow objective reality in a strict fashion. Once the rules of the universe where the movie takes place have been established, this type of action only has to follow the rules of that universe. During the first few minutes of all of these movies, we learn the rules of the game. We learn in Aliens, for example, that the story takes place in the future, there are colonial marines and xenomorphs. But the execution of the action never gets to a point where the audience is left in disbelief. Realistic action plays by the rules of the game.\n\nSemi-realistic action refers to movies where the set pieces don’t necessarily break the rules of the game, but they do bend them sometimes. Two great examples of this type of action are The Raid: Redemption and the first John Wick movie. The action in this type of films is just a notch over the top to still feel relatively grounded in reality. Films like these can show just how effective small scale hand to hand combat can be by bending the rules a little bit. However, there is a catch in these types of films. If you’re going to make a semi-realistic action movie, make sure the intention is clear, that you don’t go too far in making your audience raise their eyebrows too high in disbelief. An example of this: The worst rated movie by critics in the Fast and the Furious Franchise is Fast &amp; Furious 4. Why? This is the first movie in the franchise that doesn’t focus primarily on street racing. They introduce a handful action set pieces that aren’t grounded in reality, but since most of the movie IS relatively realistic, it feels uneven. This is key, we’re not saying unrealistic action is bad, what we’re saying is that if you’re going to try, go all the way.\n\nEnter the Over the Top action movie. While we’re already talking about the Fast and the Furious movies, they serve as a pretty good example. The worst rated in the franchise is Fast &amp; Furious 4, because it’s undecisive and isn’t sure of what it is. Coincidentally, the best rated movies in the franchise are Fast Five and Furious 7, because they went all the way. These movies know exactly what they are and they aren’t ashamed to show it: They’re cheesy, over the top action movies that don’t care if they break the rules. Break them more often, and you’ll gain a huge advantage over those too afraid to risk it, like Fast and Furious 4. John Wick: Chapter 2 is never shy or afraid to let us know that it doesn’t care that it’s unrealistic. So how does this work? You see if you break the rules enough in your movie, the audience goes along with it, but you have to stay consistent. This is why we still like cheesy action like Commando and Con Air, because they stay consistent in not giving a shit. Cheesy and unrealistic can definitely be fun, as long as you don’t hold back. \n\nSo if you want to make a successful action movie, from sci-fi to martial arts, make sure that you choose only one of these categories and you stick with it. John Wick Chapter 2 decided to be an Over the Top action movie, where Keanu Reeves kills 128 people, 51 more than in the original (Yeah, we counted.). This works because it gets to the point where a trained viewer will realize that they went for it and accepts from the start that’s it’s just not going to be realistic. Once the movie establishes that it won’t play by the rules, it can become pure escapism. It’s cheesy and fantastic and it’s one of the main reasons why John Wick: Chapter 2 worked incredibly well. They went all the way. But there’s another big reason.\n\nWhen moviegoers walked out of the original John Wick, the fans agreed that other than the fantastic action set pieces, the most compelling thing was this little universe this action flick had. The potential to expand upon it was huge and everyone wanted to know more about it. And the entire sequel is very much about expanding this universe in every way possible. Markers, new killers, Continental Hotels all over the globe, John Wick’s past, etc. It feels a lot more like a real universe here and it’s pretty great.\n\nSo, what’s in store for John Wick Chapter 3? Of course it could always be bigger and better just like the second one. But we really hope they don’t do that. Why not? While it worked for Chapter Two, it would be the same gimmick they already used. It’s tricky to do nail a trilogy, especially an action one. But we hope they’ll do something different and here are a few things that could happen: \nIt returns to being a semi-realistic action movie like the original. They probably won’t do this though, because it would feel like going in reverse.\nThey make it bigger and more over the top than Chapter Two. Like we said, we also hope they don’t do this, but maybe it works since it did for Furious 7. But there the story was pretty different than the previous entries in the franchise, so they would need a brand new story that feels fresh. But considering how Chapter Two ended, it’s probably going to be a direct continuation.\nThey make a simpler, more grounded in reality action movie. This idea may seem weird on the surface, like why would you make a John Wick movie realistic if you already established that this universe is an ultra heightened reality? This is true, but it would be a way to make the third movie different and not the same things that we’ve already seen. There can be a way to make this work. Maybe John Wick is seriously injured because he was shot and stabbed like a hundred times in Chapter Two? Maybe he’s so wounded he’s at the level of John Maclane or something. A regular guy trying to get out of a shitty situation. But maybe this idea would be too weird, I don’t know. We’re just two guys on youtube making videos but it would be interesting to see.\n\nSo whatever they choose to do, what John Wick: Chapter Three absolutely needs to do is to be different than the first two, regardless of the category they choose. Two examples of trilogies that managed to do this while maintaining the same style throughout all movies, are the Indiana Jones and Back to the Future Trilogies. While the Indiana Jones films didn’t really change it up much in terms of category of action, the stories are vastly different, but with the same beats. John Wick 3 could do this, by creating a very different story, but it requires a lot of creative talent. As for the Back to the Future, the same beats and style is seen in all three movies, but the setting is different. Three movies, same but different location, as it’s Hill Valley at different points in time. This change in setting makes the movies different enough to work.\n\nThe point is that while both trilogies have pretty much the same structure in their movies, they feel like different adventures. We hope they do something that feels new and fresh with John Wick Chapter 3 and not a rehash of the same old things. Maybe it’s a new category of action, a completely new setting or maybe even a completely different adventure with the hitman we have come to love. We’re very interested to see where they go with this and we’re actually strangely optimistic. Because if they nail this, this would be one of the best action trilogies of all time. But we’ll just have to  wait and see...\n\nVideo Form: https://youtu.be/AsFJvPbG7fI\n",

        "text": " Another Greek film brought to you by the creator of Attenberg and good friend of Giorgos Lanthimos, Athina Tsangari. The scenario is written by Efthymis Filippoy, another familiar face... or pen.\n\n In the middle of a cloudy Aegean sea, a group of men are enjoying the sea and the fish that they hit with their spreaguns. A breakdown of the yatch's engine forces the group to play a game. For the rest of the trip they have to grade each other. From the way they sleep, to their hair and the size of their penises. At the start, the game seems interesting, but as the time flees it becomes obsessive and the will of every man to win will lead to extreme behaviors.\n\nAlthough, the director's previous works are very similar to all the Greek movies that followed Dogtooth, this film is different. People are not robots, they are moving like human beings despite their defiant dialogues. While they are having an extreme behavior, they are basically acting like middle aged men. \n\nWith this film, Athina, is trying to translate fluid concepts. The concept of the best, of validation, of insecurity. The illusion that the other people are inferior, which in the context of the male gender, it can really become a competition. And yes, for that group, the person with the bigger penis has more chances of winning. The characters are judging each other like they came out of a reality show. They are willing to build spurious friendships or cause harm just to be the \"best\". **The films is really a satire of male friendships**. This satire can cause laughter at times, but like all movies Efthymis has written(Dogtooth, The Lobster, Alps, The Killing of A Sacred Deer), comedy is not the main theme. Every character represents a strand of being a man or a person in general. The movie is not misandric and you know that if you remove the cinematic exaggeration, everything you see is more or less true. \n\nThe feeling i am getting is that the idea didn't reach its potential. I would like to see even more extreme behaviors, in a different universe. The Greek New Weird Wave(or whatever people call it) is missing from this movie. Maybe, the previous movie of Athina spoiled me and i was expecting something similar. \n\n\n70/100\n\n[Imdb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3526706/)\n\n[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxAkbc2_vds)",

        "text": "I enjoy watching movies but I'm not an expert cinephile. Can people help me out a bit here? I'd love to hear various different opinions anyway on this.\n\n\n\nToday, many critics consider it not only the highest accomplishment of Chaplin's career, but **one of the greatest films of all time, period**.\n\nOn the original list of AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies, 1998, it placed #76.\n\nNearly a decade later it really shot up high, now placing #11.\n\nThe same organization considers it to be the greatest Romantic Comedy Film ever made too, beating the likes of Annie Hall, When Harry Met Sally, and It Happened One Night.\n\nNot only do many casual viewers like it, as it so happens it's also highly beloved by many of the top auteurs. It's not an art film (I think?), it's not an uber complex or complicated layered von Trier or Kubrick type of outing lol, but many of the really acclaimed serious directors absolutely adore it.\n\n\nOrson Welles said it was his **favorite film**.\n\nIn a 1963 interview in the American magazine Cinema, Stanley Kubrick rated City Lights as fifth among his top ten films.\n\nIn 1972, none other than the renowned Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky himself placed City Lights as fifth among his top ten and said of Chaplin, \"He is the only person to have gone down into cinematic history without any shadow of a doubt. The films he left behind can never grow old.\"\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw called Chaplin \"the only genius to come out of the movie industry\" (ok he wasn't a director but still)\n\nWoody Allen said it was Chaplin's best picture.\n\nThese are only some examples. \n\nSo....\n\n\n**What elements of 'City Lights' make it so beloved by just about everyone professional or not?**\n\n**Not only a critic's darling (in 1952, Sight and Sound magazine revealed the results of its first poll for \"The Best Films of All Time\"; City Lights was voted #2, after Vittorio DeSica's Bicycle Thieves; in 2002, City Lights ranked 45th on the critics' list, and that same year, directors were polled separately and ranked the film as 19th overall) but also an admired work of art by many of the top directors and filmmakers?**\n\n**On a technical AND artistic level?**\n\n**The story and the messages it conveys?**\n\n**I don't buy that it's just the ending but what about the ending anyway makes it so endearing that it almost single-handedly makes the movie?**\n\n**What lessons could anyone interested in or working in the film industry take from viewing this legendary piece of cinema, whether it be a screenwriter, actor, or director?**\n\n\n**I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts and engage in some enlightening discussion! Anyone wanna do an analysis of the film is welcome to do so.**\n",

        "text": "I'll preface by saying I love artsy films, even those that sometimes are criticized for having little plot or \"substance\". Sometimes it's about atmosphere and wonderful imagery, rather than a drum-tight thrill ride of a plot or razor sharp dialogue. Sometimes I just want to be engulfed in beautiful colors or a feeling that a scene gives me, and as long as I enjoy the experience then I'm happy. \n\nThat being said, I feel like there's been a trend of indie films being released that, while they have a few awesome scenes or a few beautiful shots, they lack anything else of substance. Like I said, I don't mind minimal dialogue or plot but the film has to be at least somewhat engaging. I'll admit I mention it way too often, but Only God Forgives was badly criticized for being slow and having almost no dialogue on top of a very thin plot. I love that movie, one of my favorite theater experiences. And I'll admit, it doesn't have much to it, but it's got some amazing atmosphere that just pulls me in, and the soundtrack and few action scenes are awesome. \n\nI've seen a few films lately that fall into the artsy bare bones category, but there's no reward. I'll list a few that I can recall off the top of my head: \n\nLike Me (2018)\n\nI had hopes for this one, it seemed really zany and artsy but outside of the first twenty minutes of awesome editing and eerie feels, it's a meandering mess of nothing. It tries to be somewhat emotional, but ends up boring and pointless. I was disappointed. \n\nBeach Rats (2017) \n\nBeach Rats is beautifully shot, I loved the use of 16mm and the night shots in it are some of the most interesting I've ever seen. The way the light is captured, the skin tones, the dreamy yet depressing way that scenes unfold. Lovely. But there was hardly any dialogue, and while the plot is straight forward and more reliant on the main character's emotional turmoil, it was a little lacking. Really enjoyed the movie, but it falls into the territory I'm speaking of. \n\nDark Night (2017)\n\nThis film was based off the Aurora theater shooting. It looked like it would be a minimalistic yet punching film, but it fell super flat. Almost no dialogue, no meaningful characters, and almost literally no plot. If I hadn't read about it before seeing it, I would have thought someone just shot random footage around a small town. Dark Night really tried to be what Elephant was for Columbine, but has none of the grace or discipline. Very disappointing. \n\nI had more examples when I was thinking about this last night, but I can't recall them. \n\nI'm rambling and I apologize but the point I guess I'm trying to make is that there are a bunch of films coming out that, while being artful and indie, seem to be made by people who went from shooting music videos or uploading pretty footage samples on Vimeo, to directing a feature film. I'm all for minimal filmmaking that relies on atmosphere and imagery, but it has to be engaging and these kinds of films aren't doing that. Obviously someone somewhere liked the idea and okay'd the film, but I don't even understand how some of these looked good on paper. \n\nI apologize for not being able to organize my thoughts well, hopefully I at least somewhat got my point across. Any thoughts?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7zjm0d/a_case_for_the_gargoyles_in_the_hunchback_of/",
        "text": "Hunchback is a bit of a sleeper classic- reception was mixed on it's release, and I think a lot of kids who viewed it when it came out weren't quite able to appreciate some of it's more subtle themes and elements. Nowadays it's getting a lot more attention, notably as one of the darkest forays a Disney feature film has ever taken, and the original child audience from the 90's are taking a closer look at it. Most agree that it was underrated in it's time, with it's beautiful animation, soundtrack, and complex characters. One thing that almost every critic brings up as a weak point of a film is the gargoyles. I mean, get rid of those and we have a real grown-up, mature movie right? And haven't we all wanted to see that from Disney? Well.... I take exception. \n\nFirst of all, this is *Disney*; they exclusively make films for children and families. They have no desire to make films for adults. While I can sympathise with the wistfulness for them to use their beautiful animation for something more PG-13, I don't think we can ever really expect that of them. As such, we can't really blame them for balancing out the dark tone of the film with some lighthearted comic relief. \n\nSecondly, Disney did make a pretty blatant attempt to nod to the adult audience that the gargoyles were never really alive; that they were projections of Quasimodo, a way for him to cope with being lonely his entire life. Think of Wilson in Cast Away. Complete isolation can lead to people to project personalities onto inanimate objects. There are two scenes in the film where Disney nods to the more discerning viewer, the first being [the first time that Frollo and Quasimodo interact.](https://youtu.be/P_TTo0zCUsg) Reading Quasimodo's reaction at being caught speaking to stone gargoyles makes me feel as though he is embarassed to be caught by Frollo; it's not simply glossed over or brushed off, or not commented on at all. The scene serves a purpose, and since Frollo doesn't humiliate or punish Quasimodo for this action, we can assume it isn't character development, it's plot development. Quasimodo accepts the gargoyles are merely stone, and the story moves on. Subtle enough for kids to miss, but with enough plausible deniability that adults can assume that the gargoyles are imaginary friends of a lonely person. The second scene that gives away the gargoyles is [this one ](https://youtu.be/jVwGyccdFzM), where Esmerelda brings Phoebus to Quasimodo at the end of a musical number. Just prior we saw the gargoyles pulling red banners over Quasimodo with all the symbols of romantic love; the very next frame shows some old fabric and storage items. Clearly all the fanfare was in Quasimodo's head; if none of the other objects were real, then the gargoyles must not truly be alive either. Quasimodo must have a great imagination to help him cope with his very sad existence. \n\nSpeaking of which... I feel as though the absence of any friends or anyone to talk to aside from Frollo would have significantly altered the mood of the film. What child wouldn't find it upsetting that Quasimodo has never had a friend in his life? Again, Hunchback is a family picture. Which almost never go the \"dark and tortured\" route. Disney gives the children some solace that at least Quasimodo has had some happiness and company in his lonely life while still nodding to adults that he had to invent them to cope with the situation. I think this is very cleverly done, personally, as most Disney comic relief is blatantly only that. \n\nAnd finally... The gargoyles are just not that bad of characters. They even have some genuinely comedic moments. Like [this one](https://youtu.be/mlo0cQKEHWM), which happens immediately after Frollo tries to murder an innocent family by burning them alive in their own home and one of our leads gets shot up with arrows and falls into a river. Pretty dark stuff by Disney standards! So how do they break up the tension? By having some of their comic relief be more concerned with losing a poker game with a pigeon than the tragedy unfolding before them. It's an incredibly quick and absurd joke and every time I see it it makes me laugh. It's also surprisingly self-aware; it knows after the dark scene we just witnessed, the kids probably could use something light and silly. This point is far more opinion based than my others, and I may be in the minority for enjoying the gargoyles for what they are. But there have been far worse Disney sidekicks in other films that add little or NOTHING to the story. These characters provide comedic balance for the kids, but they are also a reflection of how Quasimodo thinks and feels, how he gets through his day, how he despairs, how he motivates himself and cheers himself up. They're the only friends he's ever had and hell, how much worse off would he have been without them? Personally, I find them necessary, funny, and quite honestly an intelligent addition for Disney. If you look at them as just Quasimodo's imaginary friends, they're quite alright. ",
