        "text": "Outbursts… Jumping from 0 to 100 in a millisecond… I (28F) find it almost impossible to regulate my emotions in those moments. Everything goes so fast and when I realise what I’ve just said it’s already out of my mouth and the harm is done. Some periods are better, but when being under stress I can have outbursts multiple times a week. I know I can be rational when it comes to friends and work. I can get mad sometimes but I don’t lose my shit ever and can calmly discuss what has been bothering me. But then there’s my partner: the most amazing and loveable man. It’s a red tread apparently to dump it all on the person who stands closest to me since I recognise this behaviour from previous relationships. I can’t seem to bite my tongue, take a step back and think of the consequences of the destructive behaviour I’m about to perform. No. I am “myself”, no filter - and the beast gets unleashed real quick. I always feel regret right after - and sooooo much guilt. He really doesn’t deserve it. I even scare myself with the things I’ve said. Things that don’t even have to be the truth. In the heat of the moment I think I just want to hurt because I’m hurt. My partner has forgiven me time after time although he doesn’t understand ADHD to the slightest but he does understand I don’t really wanna act this way, my apologies are sincere and that I really do try to change. But what actually works? Like what to do in that one millisecond where time moves faster than light? I don’t want to accept “I am just this way” but I haven’t found the solution for me yet. I was hoping you guys who have want to share their tactics so hopefully I and maybe others can learn to get better at regulating emotions. Thanks a lot in advance!",

For example like 10 minutes ago within the space of like a minute I saw 1 tiktok video about aftershaves and ended up buying one for £60 about a minute later without much thought to it whatsoever.

She's known friends who's personality/brain were subsequently \"fucked up\" after getting on Adderall, and said friends regret starting the medication.\n\nAt the same time, I know that there's also a lot of good that can come from medication and how it affects your mood and productivity.\n\nThe both of us are worried that my personality may change as well with starting medication.\n\nHow worried should we be?

For example, the 9-5 work schedule often doesn't work for those of us who have comorbid sleep disorders. Lecture-style classes often don't work for those of us with inattentive issues. The typical system used for scheduling appointments is difficult for most of us, as there are tons of things we have to do often in order to schedule the appointments (like fill out paperwork, call ahead, mark a calendar, etc.).\n\nAll of this has made me think about what having ADHD would be like in a world that was designed with ADHD in mind.\n\n**So I'm curious: what kinds of changes would you make in the way the world works? What kinds of structural changes do y'all think would help manage ADHD or make living with ADHD easier?**",

Or should I try change psychiatrists in hope that others would be more willing to prescribe meds along with something to keep my heart in check?\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on the whole matter? I really hope to stay on Atomoxetine so any advice would be really appreciated.",

I'm sick of the fact that I'll always fuck up somehow, and people will think I'm a bad person or that I don't care, or even that I'm not trying, but what I'm most tired of is the fact that I have to act like its alright, and that I'm not exhausted by the time I leave my house to go to work. I'm sick of the fact that I need to pretend like the tasks I'm being trusted with aren't massively overwhelming or knowing that, despite their kind words, nobody thinks I'm reliable. I hate that I have to spend every day pretending that being spacey and forgetful is just some fun personality quirk and not an exhausting well of frustration and a source of self-hatred. There is so much more that I hate about my brain in my day-to-day life that I don't want to dump on you all, so I'll stop that here.  \n\nI know that the world won't change for me, but I wish it would for others. I had a kid come up to me at my work today because they had hurt themselves and needed some medical care, and while we talked, he paused and said, \"I'm sorry, I'm being really annoying right now,\" so naturally (and truthfully) I told them that they weren't and that I really enjoy their style of conversation.  They then straight up asked me if I was ADHD, which was fine because I'd known this kid since well before I started working at their school, and I told them I did. They said they did as well, and it was a nice moment because he clearly felt seen in some sense. What fucks with me is that he felt the need to apologize for being himself and that he saw it as annoying. Even if it was said in a sort of nonchalant way, that isn't something folks just say without kind of believing it. It makes me incredibly sad to see young ADHD people internalizing the same shame that I'm still battling through today. \n\nLike, why the fuck should we feel like we're annoying? It isn't like we made a choice to deal with this. It isn't our fault, but it is our problem, and I just find myself in this state of existential dread because I know that nobody will ever think as highly of me as I want, and it's all because of the way my brain is wired.  I'm never going to be on equal footing with my peers, and that's an exhausting thought. It doesn't matter how much effort I put in. Nothing I do is ever going to be on par. \n\nI don't really know what I can do. I'm so tired of it. I don't want to do it anymore, but I will because I don't have any choice. \n\nThanks to those of you who listened, and I hope you are doing well. And to those who may have identified with some of the things I said, just know that we will make it. I guess it doesn't have to be this miserable if we don't let it. Love yall.",

I've had a few times in the past where my anxiety wasn't nearly as bad sometimes, and I had no idea why. Am I going insane from sleep deprivation, or is that a thing? Usually, social interaction is something that I hate doing, but sometimes, when I get up really early to study or am up really late studying, it seems to come way easier to me.\n\n Same with ADHD, when I'm doing ADHD stuff around people like losing focus or fidgeting it doesnt stress me out nearly as much when Im sleep deprived/tired, and as a result I'm not making myself quiet to avoid saying something impulsively that nobody would even remember. Also, when something needs to get done I swear I'm able to plan out what needs to get done much better, which would mean that my ADHD just wasn't getting in the way how it usually does. As stupid as this sounds my 4 am study sessions usually go pretty well.\n\nThis doesn’t seem to make any sense,  and I'm \ntrying to find other factors that would be concurrent to sleep deprivation, but I'm not really sure. Anxiety and ADHD are both massive problems, so I'm trying to figure out what the possible reason for this is in case it is useful. Obviously I can't go around sleep deprived 24/7, but if I'm doing something different somehow because of sleep deprivation, I would like to figure it out.",

        "text": "So I felt this would be a good place to discuss this as our stress often comes from a similar place and manifests in similar ways.\n\nThis is as falling behind in school or work, working more slow than average, time-blindness, forgetfulness, obsessively adapting  schedules because they never seem to work out and several more do really easily cause stress.\n\nAnd further the search for motivation, daydream, interest, reassurance and whatnot that is exasperated in us I feel like can make it harder to live in the moment and not stress over mid to near future events so saying just live in the moment is difficult to make happen even without being a particularly anxious person.\n\nThis then can be really distracting in the present which then causes stress which then further distracts you and becomes a vicious cycle.\n\nIt's also hard to disguss with neurotypicals sometimes because it isn’t an irrational anxiety situation but rather a very real cycle of frustration and things \"accidentally falling apart\" over the course of our lives.\n\nSo I'm looking to discuss tips, tricks and support in dealing with this and open up a conversation about this as I figured that this could be experienced regularly to high levels between people with adhd, I find it does with me at least haha.\n\nAnyway here are the ideas I have had or found (they arent great necessarily but I tried) but would love some more :) \n\n- Imagining your thoughts and stress as a song or TV show you dislike, changing the channel or turning down the volume - they’re still there, but you don’t have to listen to them. \n\n- the app \"habitica\" to break down tasks focus back on instant reward instead (gamifies any tasks you need to do so you can break down tasks as much as you want)\n\n- take a break from overly emotional music\n\n- take a break to focus on something light hearted from the *past* (eg discuss a funny moment or something you watched with a friend for 5 minutes or write down what you liked about that moment or why it was funny)\n\n- finding people (if you can) who can reassure that you are ok and can give you a hug\n\n- take a break and go throw something (idk like a paper scrunched up ball or something lol)",

        "text": "hey guys i’ve never really posted on reddit before. i’ve been struggling for a long time now. i was just wondering if any of you guys had any strategies you use to regulate your mindset, motivation and focus (excuse the grammar)\n\nEveryday is a mental struggle for me - it’s like fighting a war in my head for a glimpse of feeling fulfilled and happy. i feel like there’s a million things i have to do and want to do and write so many things down over and over to do, that i don’t get around to and start the next day writing the same things down. \n\nI can’t start anything and when I do, I can never finish it. Things that take 2 minutes that would make me happy, I end up thinking about for ages and take no action. I can’t commit to school, a job, myself or my responsibilities. I feel overwhelmed and stressed out almost all day, everyday and have for the last half decade now. \n\nI waste time doing simple things like scrolling and playing games I don’t even want to play. I have so much ambition and it makes me sad I can’t take action on any of it when it’s all i think about and want to do. I’m in the worst rut of my life and can’t get out. I can’t start anything unless I know I can start and finish it - to a perfect degree, which furthers the inaction paralysis. I overthink everything and have made so many notes to look at to encourage certain mindsets, motivation etc. I am prescribed adderall and it helps a little, but not enough. \n\nI just want to live my life and be proud and happy. I feel like i’m letting myself and everyone in my life down everyday.\n\nThank you so much for taking time out of your day to read this. I would treasure any advice you could give me. Thank you :)\n\ntldr: please help me fight back against mental despair with any tips or advice :)",

I want to get medicated if possible as well and go off my antidepressant if possible. I take Wellbutrin and it's been making me really dumb. And my working memory is almost non existent.

So I have my prescription changed to one of those, and called that location. This lady was NOT nice (bad day, tired of answering questions about it, idk). Proceeds to tell me that there's a shortage (I am aware), and there's none within 20 miles, just deal with it. So I'm starting to panic, and just have my doctor switch it to another CVS that the first pharmacist said would be the most likely, hoping for the best, prepared for the worst. It was ready in 30 minutes 🙃\n I understand that the pharmacists are tired of the same questions, and the verbal abuse (that I have witnessed before), but if I'm being patient and polite, a little bit of empathy would be great. I know they're stressed, but we are too! We don't get to just clock out and forget about it. \n I hope the shortage ends soon, I hate this :( \n I had a friend recommend Amazon's pharmacy, has anyone here tried it before?",

I did love that really quiet feeling that 7.5mg (2x a day) of instant release gave me, I scheduled my mentally intensive work tasks around that 1 / 2 hour window. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA downside I noted to my doctor last week during our second meeting (after 30 days of adderral IR) that after the 4 hour window is up my inattentiveness SKYROCKETS, and I've had a few dangerous situations (fireplace incident) and a bunch more \"silly mistakes,\" such as accidentally wearing sandles to the gym. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe're trying 20MG XR now, so essentially i went from 15MG total a day to 20MG total a day, plus the slow drip delivery system of XR. I've noticed I'm missing that \"on\" feeling, which doc mentioned to me before hand that some people do prefer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne positive note about XR is that I'm not making absurdly inattentive mistakes after 6PM, which is really nice, because I was scared I was going to accidentally get hurt if I kept that up. In terms of motivation, or ability to do things that I know I need to do, it's not as strong as IR. Also, as noted in the title of the post, my head is once again a total chatterbox. I've practiced meditation prior to my diganosis and relied on it to function on days where my internal thoughts are very chaotic, so I'm utilizing this skill again, but damn do I miss not needing to mentally think endlessly about everything 24/7. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot sure if that is my seeking a high or a legitimate symptom that is shown to be treatable via medication. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI personally don't think I need to risk addiction or severe dependence just to maximize all possible benefits of medication, as I definitely value stability, even if my appartment is messy again haha. I'll just clean whenever I can't stand it anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI appreciate the thoughts and advice! This community has been so understanding and supportive.",

Lecture-style classes often don't work for those of us with inattentive issues. The typical system used for scheduling appointments is difficult for most of us, as there are tons of things we have to do often in order to schedule the appointments (like fill out paperwork, call ahead, mark a calendar, etc.).\n\nAll of this has made me think about what having ADHD would be like in a world that was designed with ADHD in mind.\n\n**So I'm curious: what kinds of changes would you make in the way the world works?

The whole story about that she never thinks a thought also just seems like another lie. \n\nIve offered her many times to try my meds to see how it felt but she doesnt want to and she says she doesnt want medication for her adhd.",

I can't take meds cause I'm a teenager so I can't get meds myself and my parents refuse to acknowledge it because it doesn't fit into their ideals\n\nTldr:need help finding out how to get along with people in school.",

Since it's a water soluble medication, if this shows improvement, I'm going to ask the doc for a 70mg and split it 50/50 in water and make two doses. That will cut the costs. Also read taking it with protein is important so I'll add an additional whey shake in the morning. Wish me luck!",

In this way I was mostly absorbing the audio and I would glance at the picture every so often. \n\nI am re-experiencing a lot of shows and movies and it's great to be able to actually focus on the cinematography! \n\nIt really makes me wonder how much of life I missed growing up because my brain was always in two places at once!",

        "text": "Honestly just want to know if anybody else who is working (especially in corporate retail) struggles with this.\nI have a lot of ideas. Not to hype myself up but a lot of the time they are really good and unique ideas. \nI also don’t like doing nothing on shift because I get too far in my head, so I don’t mind taking initiative to implement my ideas, and I’m not necessarily looking for credit by doing more than I’m asked, or even acknowledgement, but I can’t stop myself from talking about it anyway and for some reason there’s always managers that find something wrong with everything I do. \n\nHere is a non conclusive list of various things I have experienced regarding the above:\n1. I’ll bring an idea to the manager and they will misinterpret everything I’ve said and tell me why my misinterpreted idea doesn’t work. I’ll show up at work one day to find that they implemented the idea I *tried* to communicate a long time prior. \n\n2. My shift will be slow and I’ll work on something new that nobody asked me to do. When I present it to get an opinion, instead of getting praise or feedback for working on something that could improve the workplace I am asked why I am not working on other menial or trivial tasks that are usually a waste of time to begin with. \n\n3. When I notice a mistake my coworkers have made, or a mistake with current systems, by trying to fix them and point them out I am blamed for the mistakes themselves instead of praised for my attention to detail.\n\n4. After busting ass for an entire day, while taking a 30 second break to speak with a coworker management always tends to walk in at that particular moment and ask why I am not doing my job. \n\nI have some decent managers that make work bearable, and who give me recognition sometimes. I cannot stand others in particular for the reasons I’ve listed above. \nMost people will say to just sit back and do the bare minimum, and my response to that is I have tried, I just forget honestly. \nIn school having unique ideas is praised (sometimes lol), but it seems like when you become an adult all of that goes out the window, and it makes me feel subhuman. \n\nHow does this relate to adhd? Idk it seems like an adhd trait to take unique approaches to troubleshooting problems so I thought I might find some familiars in this thread.\nCan anyone here give me advice to keep going and not quit my job?",

        "text": "Hi, I was unmedicated for almost 3 years, during this time I racked up over $2,500 in traffic tickets. I am appealing to a judge to get the cost down given that I don't have that much money.\n\nI am a much better driver when I am on my meds and am on them currently now for 2 months (no tickets), and now able to deal with the tickets. Without meds, I dont even think about paying them as I am so impulsive and absent minded, I want to pay them just dont have that much money. \n\nWhen appealing to the judge and writing a letter, should I mention my ADHD and being unmedicated when I got the tickets and even a letter from a psychiatrist saying that I am now better? Or would that not be wise give the stigma of this illness?\n\nThe tickets were mostly for forgetting to have my drivers license on me, or other ADHD like mistakes which I do not make when I am on my meds. \n\nLet me know your thoughts\n\nThank you!!",
