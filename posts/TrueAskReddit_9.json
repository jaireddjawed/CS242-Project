However, [the comment below](https://np.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/8yyhvc/should_christians_support_proper_sex_education/e2flfs7/?context=3&amp;utm_content=context&amp;utm_medium=message&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage) caught my attention because it had a very different message from the rest:\n\n&gt;You know, for modern people who laugh at ancient goat herders, it's funny that they need schools for sex ed. Why has it become necessary to have sex education in school? Did sex fundamentally change after 1960? No it didn't, people just learned to forget what sex is about as contraceptives became normalized.\n\nDid people really forget what sex is about due to the invention of contraceptives which allow us to escape the consequences of sex? If not, how come earlier generations didn't need comprehensive sex education?",

        "text": "I was watching [this video](https://youtu.be/cXTjL-f-msU) where Dave Rubin is speaking with someone who appears to try to attack him all the time but what really interested me is when they started to mention about freedom such as when he mentioned that he believes that people should be allowed to hate others like Jews and gays (Dave Rubin is Jewish and gay) even though he does not  condone it.\n\nThat is where I am very curious about this becuase while there are quite a lot of debates about giving freedom and a voice to the oppressed and the minorities like women (yes, females managed to improve a lot but there are still some issues like internalized gender roles and so on. Suffice to say that even men experience this kind of taboo), the LGBT+ community, blacks, and other ethnic minorities and so on (even though these changes started to take shape since the 60s)\n\nSo to a certain level, this limits certain behaviours like hate speech, hate crimes and so on but at the same time it makes me wonder, should we be allowed to NOT hate these people? If not, hate certain people at all?\n\nYes, there is someone who really hates blacks, or a black person really hating white people becuase of a personal trauma. \n\nThis may easily turn into hate speech but at the same time, it is also understandable so should this person be censored to not express the personal frustration becuase of a personal incident, even though this internalized bias may not be rational or may not represent to the entire population?\n\nThis goes to a lot about what people say or cannot say on the media, or on social media and so on.\n\nOn one hand, there were instances where people made some humiliating remarks like in the recent incident where [Papa John's founder said the N-word in a meeting](https://www.google.com.mt/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/business-44823852) but at the same time, plenty of people saying derogatory terms all the time, whether online or not, whether intentation or not or where it was meant to be a joke, a sarcastic comment and so on\n\n(This also comes to mind about the [AIDS tweet by a woman a couple of years ago which literally ruined her life](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html?nytmobile=0) which is ironic becuase this is just one comment out of possible millions of others like it)\n\nThis is very puzzling because on one hand, everyone wants to have that freedom of expression, whatever kind that exists, while at the same time, there are people out there who think that their freedom of expression is not represented enough, or which to express their own freedom of expression by suppressing the freedom of expression of others, or feel that they get attacked for certain comments that they may or may not make even though they are protected by the First Amendament",

When you are feeling angry or annoyed, you have to learn how to maintain it or control it or perhaps even use it to your advantage without hurting the client. When you are feeling sad or down or tired, you have to learn how to continue to keep going without letting these affect your cognitive judgement.\n\n*(and in many situations, whatever word you say, or whatever approach you take, it may be a conseuqence of some kind. Could be a geniune approach for one person but at the same time, it could a micro-aggression for another person. Or whatever you say, someone can be insulted but able to brush it off, or someone considers it as a very serious issue as they feel that such an approach will unconsciously reinforce internalised schemas or biases towards certain people and reinforce certain mental categorisations in certain ways)*\n\nA therapist or any kind of helper or professional in the health care department must be self-aware and cautious about how they behave and react to other's people's behaviours and problems, whether it is because of a certain issue that they have such as depression or anxiety or schizophrenia, or whether it is because of a certain behaviour or attitude that they have such as arrogance or apathy which can challenge your tolerance.\n\nThat being said, I have been increasingly aware lately of the sheer coverage about political correctness in the media \n\n__________________________________________________________\n\n**NOTE** - I am **NOT** saying that I am against political correctness because it is way more complicated than it sounds and I do not want this to turn into a political war. Plus, you cannot trust the media either because certain coverage may make a certain phenomenon to appear as something drastic when in reality, it may be a small one or sensationalised. Bear in mind that I am not saying that I either pro-PC and anti-PC and I just saying that the amount of coverage about it lately is making me self-aware of my own behaviours\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nI have been following some of the news involving Jordan Peterson and his criticisms against a certain bill (feel free to research it because it is way too complicated to explain it in short but in simple terms - he is defending free speech and does not want that the pronounciation of certain pronouns of transgender people becomes compelled speech as this may be abused or used with the wrong intentions) and have been going through other accounts where political correctness or behaviours that are similar to that of political correctness have caused more harm than good \n\n(for example - I learned about the [colour-blind approach](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/colorblind/201112/colorblind-ideology-is-form-racismhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/colorblind/201112/colorblind-ideology-is-form-racism) that is also more harmful than one might think which honestly, I was not aware of this despite my intentions to avoid thinking in manners that influenced my sub-consciously internalised beliefs about certain minorities; there was [an incident in the UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal) that existed for years and even though there were warnings made by a [certain person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Champion_(politician)), there were little actions made because of the fear that such actions would trigger allegations of racism and damage community relations)\n\nI am starting to think and wonder that if I continue to behave in more considerate manners (at least the certain level of what you would define as \"considerate\" in a more extreme form), I would be protecting my clients from even developing the resilience or the courage to expose themselves that the phenomena that they need to confront in their lives\n\n*(And no, I am not asking them to \"toughen up\" because - a) It depends on the individual. b) That straight-forward approach, although very blunt and straight-forward, may not be the most effective approach especially for certain individuals and it will make the helper appear unprofessional. c) Teaching clients how to be resilence takes time and requires a lot of trust but it is the client that has to do it. So just bluntly telling them what to do or not to do is not helpful and will make the client dependent and not empowered which goes against of what therapy mostly focuses on)*\n\n(I am not an expert or a therapist but in the hopes that if I ever become one, this makes me more cautious about my approaches in the future as it makes me think that I will doing more damage than good if I behave in such ways to my clients)\n\nIt gives me the impression that instead of being tactful and considerate in order to trigger my clients the feeling of understanding and empathy (or sympathy in case it is very hard to understand their perspectives) and the feeling of safety and attachment, I am actually beginning to feel afraid that if I do not tell them that they might have to have to courage and the resilience or the self-awareness to face these undesired phenomena in a more effective manner, I fear that they will run away from the problems forever and will eventually put them in a spiral of slowly increasing list of problems to themselves and to others in the future\n\nSo in all, at what level can being empathetic and considerate in your approaches become considered as too much?",

Both of these countries/cultures went through incredible changes in the 20th century, yet it always feels like the system never actually changed, rather just the factions who assumed control over a system with similar principle.\n\n\nHere in Hungary, the previous era of Communist-socialist regime is romanticized by many, as if the balance was a lot more akin to our nationality. It is almost comically halfway between the Eastern(russian) and Western world in every sense. Our current laws seem like a Democracy, but they are full of exploitable holes and a lot more witch-hunt-like publicity stunts that a westerner would bear (anti-Soros campaign) as if a straight up westerner way was not alright with the people deep down. \n\nI have a strong opinion that it is very hard to change this tendency even if we wanted to do so, yet I am asking you, whether you have a different opinion on it?",

        "text": "It is pretty clear that humans are very diverse in their ways of living. They have different philosophies, ideas, interests and biases and even occupations and cultures that influence their beliefs like politics, religion, shared social values and norms and so on.\n\nAnd in many cases, people also argue. Sometimes in a non-aggressive manner like conversation, sometimes in manners that are more aggressive and provoke conflict like warfare, political arguments and propoganda, or perhaps different pursuits of interest like a philosopher trying to prove something or make an argument.\n\nAnd it is also a bit obvious that logic and reason, even though they are highly praised and supported in many cultures of today, logic is not a direction with only one road.\n\nPeople reason differently and their reasonings are influenced by many factors that they may not be aware of like cognitive biases, certain patterns in their thinking, heuristics (which may also be influenced by possible biases) and so on.\n\nThere were times that people wanted to make something new or support some revolutionary ideas which were not exactly of sound mind or the big reasoning like Communism and the USSR, or different philosophies or sciences that were later proven to be false or pseudosciences like N-Rays or polywater \n\nThere were times that people defended their arguments rigorously and want to keep things the way they are like in political arguments for example.\n\nAnd obviously, in many cases, no person is completely 100% correct, perhaps not even the most brilliant or respected intellectually capable individuals like scientists, statisticians or historians or philosophers and so on.\n\nIn many cases, you have to defend your position because you will encounter plenty of people who will or may do anything to shake your beliefs into nothing but dust or make you look like a complete fool, whether it is because of trolls, or whether it is because of they are not exactly aware that they hate simply because your opinions or statements are not the same as theirs, or simply because they will do anything to make their arguments the only ones that sound out, and so on.\n\nOn the other hand, you must also be very aware of your own arguments as well and be self-aware enough of whether you are making the sound arguments because most of how we think and perceive the world are influenced by unconscious factors and most of these happen sometimes very quickly within our own brains, or happen silently without even being aware of them.\n\nThis is something that often makes me very puzzled because there are probably countless of factors that influence how we think, sometimes factors that support our reasoning, sometimes factors that oppose our reasoning and may eventually respond on different ways (like projections or transference for example, instead of thinking before acting) and I am not sure which behaviour or action is appropriate for which for which time or position that we may be in\n\n",
