Then I moved on to own a restaurant and catering company.  For the rest of my career I was an Executive Chef and Brand Ambassador for a German knife company. I traveled around the country teaching knife skill classes, cooking classes and did demos on stage at food and wine festivals. \n\nNow I am so happy to be using my knowledge to connect with people to find the cutlery and cookware that is just right for them as an expert at Curated.com.  I'll be hosting an AMA today, November 15th @ 11am CST and we can hone in on all of your cutlery and cookware questions.\n\nMy favorite part of my job is sharing my knowledge so that people understand how to use the different tools of the kitchen, so the time they spend cooking goes from boohoo üò± to YAHOO üôåüèº\n\nAsk me anything about...finding the perfect knife, cookware materials, chopping techniques, home kitchens, commercial kitchens, what it's like to work in a restaurant, catering, hotel, BBQ, brisket, and ribs! \n\nTalk to you at 11 AM CST! You can check out my profile here in the meantime - [https://www.curated.com/e/michael.garaghty?utm\\_source=reddit](https://www.curated.com/e/michael.garaghty?utm_source=reddit) \n\nProof: [https://imgur.com/a/enA5eSW](https://imgur.com/a/enA5eSW)",

For the past few years, I've been writing a Stereogum column called The Number Ones, where I'm reviewing every #1 hit in the history of the Billboard Hot 100. I've written almost 900 of those columns so far, and I'm only up to 2003. In the book, I'm focusing on a bunch of #1 hits that marked moments of big change on the pop charts and, in some cases, popular culture in general.\n\nI've been a full-time music critic since 2005, and I've worked for places like Pitchfork and the Village Voice. For the past decade-plus, I've been the senior editor at Stereogum. I'm seven feet tall. If you feel like asking me questions about #1 hits, or being tall, or whatever else, then this is your day. Let's party.\n\nPROOF: https://i.redd.it/jr8rit0czez91.jpg",

Kaj Larsen has 13 years in the Global War on Terror as a SEAL officer with multiple deployments to the Middle East, Africa, and Asia theaters. Sean Bonner is a 20 year Wall St. veteran who after 9/11 joined the Navy Reserve Intelligence officer corp at 32 years old. \n\nWe teamed up exactly a year ago to build a financial platform for veterans called [Guild](https://guild.financial/). What we saw was that Wall street and the private wealth community had left the military behind. Most of the financial services for military and veterans were just bad. The result: a lack of financial literacy in the military community and service members being taken advantage of. But we thought that was fixable, hence Guild.\n\nHappy to talk about all things veterans, financial, SEALs, why Navy will win the Army/Navy game, or anything else in our world. In March and April, both of us were on the ground in Ukraine, doing our part. In our non-\nservice lives, Sean spent a career as a fund manager and trader. Kaj was a journalist and filmmaker with shows on HBO and Netflix.\n\nAsk us anything!\n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://imgur.com/a/MC0gSR0 (Kaj); https://imgur.com/a/w661H1p (Sean))!",

        "text": "PROOF: https://i.redd.it/vzoj3bda5hx91.jpg\n\nHi again Reddit!  Our [last engineering AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/hiw8qt/im_david_aldridge_the_director_of_engineering_for/) was super fun and I‚Äôm back for more.  I‚Äôm joined today by our Senior Engineering Manager, Ylan Salsbury [(/u/BNG-ylan)](https://www.reddit.com/user/BNG-ylan). \n\nLast year I took on a new role here ‚Äì Head of Engineering.  One of my responsibilities is defining What Good Looks Like for engineering at Bungie.  Historically we‚Äôve conveyed that mostly by example, implicitly handing down culture to new hires one interaction at a time.  That worked ok because of our moderate size, very long average tenure, and heavy in-person collaboration.  However, with our commitment to [digital-first](https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1514000368421814282) and continuing rapid growth (125-&gt;175 engineers over the last 2 years and many [open roles](https://careers.bungie.com/jobs)!), we needed a better way.\n\nSo we built a Values Handbook and recently [published it on our Tech Blog](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/51421).  It‚Äôs not short or punchy.  It‚Äôs not slogans or buzzwords.  It‚Äôs not even particularly technical ‚Äì with the tremendous diversity of our tech challenges, there are very few tech principles that apply across the whole of Bungie.  We don‚Äôt think the magic of how we engineer is found in brilliant top-down technical guidance - we hire excellent engineers and we empower them to make their own tech decisions as much as possible.  No, we think the magic of our engineering is in how we work together in ways that build trust, generate opportunities, and make Bungie a joyful and satisfying place to be for decades.\n\nSo yea, I‚Äôm curious to hear what you think of our [Values Handbook](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/51421) and what questions it makes you think of.  Also happy to answer other questions.  Just like last AMA, I want to shout out to friends from [r/destinythegame](https://www.reddit.com/r/destinythegame/) with a reminder that Ylan and I aren‚Äôt the right folks to answer questions about current game design hot topics or future Destiny releases, so you can expect us to dodge those.  Other than that, please AMA!  We'll be answering as many questions as we can from at least 2-4pm pacific.",

        "text": "Hey Reddit, this is my 2nd try at this as my first post got taken down for being too spammy.\n\nPorndora was something I wanted to build for a long time. I was an early engineer at Tinder and I thought, \"Why can't we apply simple swipe mechanics (like/disliked) with a recommendation engine to other things besides people? Could we apply them to porn?\"\n\nAt the time, the domain porndora.com, was parked, but I put a watch on it, and in 2018 acquired it at auction for about $2500. I was building another company, [Safara.Travel](https://Safara.Travel), at the time, but started to tinker away at Porndora when I had time. \n\nWhen Covid hit in 2020, all of the sudden I had a lot more time, so I dove in, raised some money from friends and family, and went at it full time.\n\nSince then, I've built up a 7 person remote-first team with people all over the world , we've scaled our user base to the thousands monthly, we started making some money, and we've built some really cool shit, including an adult NFT marketplace and PornDJ, which is a true expression of my original vision for Porndora.\n\nWe've also tried to raise money from institutional investors / VCs and been unsuccessful. I knew it would be hard raising money in a sinful industry, but it was even harder than I imagined. So now I'm bootstrapping the company.\n\nWe've been in business for a couple years now and are NOT affiliated with the old [porndora.sexy](https://porndora.sexy/).\n\nSite: [porndora.com](https://porndora.com/)\n\nTwitter: [twitter.com/porndoracom](https://twitter.com/porndoracom)\n\nProof: [https://twitter.com/porndoracom/status/1589408666909900800](https://twitter.com/porndoracom/status/1589408666909900800)",
