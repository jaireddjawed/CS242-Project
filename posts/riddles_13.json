        "text": "Hello dear **riddler** fellows.  I want to ask for your support to unearth this forgotten subreddit about **Lateral Thinking**.  \n\n\n# What is lateral thinking?\n\n&gt;**Lateral thinking** is solving problems through an indirect and creative approach, using reasoning that is not immediately  obvious and involving ideas that may not be obtainable by using only traditional step-by-step logic. The term was promulgated in 1967 by Edward de Bono. He cites as an example the Judgment of Solomon,  where King Solomon resolves a dispute over the parentage of a child by  calling for the child to be cut in half, and making his judgment  according to the reactions that this order receives. [Edward de Bono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_de_Bono) also links lateral thinking with humour, arguing  there's a switchover from a familiar pattern to a new, unexpected one.   It is in this moment of surprise that generates laughter and new insight  which demonstrates an ability to see a different thought pattern that  initially was not obvious.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;According to de Bono, lateral thinking deliberately distances  itself from the standard perception of creativity as \"vertical\" logic  (the classic method for problem solving).\n\n# How lateral thinking can help us find better ideas\n\nThe whole purpose of lateral thinking is to allow us to cut across  patterns and to find new ideas. As with all creativity, the ideas must  be valuable and logical in hindsight. This is what occurs in an  asymmetric system. Something might be invisible in foresight, but  obvious and logical in hindsight. This fact was never observed by  traditional philosophers, who were busy playing around with words rather  than understanding the behaviour of self-organising information  systems. \\[[Read more...](https://www.management-issues.com/opinion/5643/how-lateral-thinking-can-help-us-find-better-ideas/)\\]\n\n  \nIf you are still interested after reading this short intro feel free to subscribe to and try to solve the first riddles posted: [/r/lateralthinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/lateralthinking)  \n",
