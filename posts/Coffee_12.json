That being said I don't know everything, so I wanted to ask y'all!\n\nThe other day I had a guy come in and ask my coworker for an caf√© ameicano, and she asked if he wanted any room for cream (half and half). He said, no americanos come with whole milk. She tried to tell him that americanos are a water based espresso drink (she wasn't being sassy, just wanted to make sure he knew what he would be getting). He then got frustrated and rudely told he that \"No, I promise you the -o in americano means whole milk. An americana means with breve.\"\n\nI was annoyed with his tone but I  didn't want to press the situation so I made him his drink (an americano with steamed milk). I did some googling after and the name for what he ordered was an americano au lait (which makes sense). Is a caf√© americano/a a thing? Or was he just being rude?",

I followed the directions of the video online, removed the four screws, pulled out the auger key, pressed in the auger so it popped back and pulled it out, then removed the spring. Everything super easy and the same as the video. \n\nThen I cleaned out the burrs and went back to reassemble, put back in the spring, put back on the auger, but I don't understand how the auger key system works. There is nothing preventing the spring from pushing back the auger and the auger key? If I push the auger in and line up the auger key and insert the spring just pushes them both away from the shaft. Is the goal for the dial/faceplate to hold the auger and auger key in place? That is what I did, but it sounds like the motor is struggling slightly since I reassembled it this way and now I am afraid to use the machine.\n\nAny insight appreciated.",

I've had a cheaper machine with a thermal carafe and found it much harder to clean, so I'm hesitant. I sense that the general consensus is to avoid hotplates like the plague, and I'm 50/50 on them: I had a Mr. Coffee in college that destroyed the coffee as fast as it brewed, but my family has had a cheap machine with a hotplate for years that, as far as I can tell, never greatly affected the flavor.\n\nAnybody have experience with the glass Moccamaster?",

        "text": "I was in the market for a cheaper option for a hand grinder that can handle a wide range of brews. Because I'm on a tight budget, I spend a lot of time searching the internet for the most affordable grinder that can provide me with good pour-overs, aeropress, and can work on my flair signature bottomless. I must say the market has evolved a lot in the last 2-3 years, with a lot more options to choose from.\nAnyways, I stumble on a brand called MHW-3BOMBER. The name is a bit confusing, but it turns out they are doing quite well, with great reviews on AE and their Instagram activity being quite impressive.\n\nSo after much research, I pulled the trigger on the M1 Racer Grinder.  For $54, it is said to be capable of espresso to french press with hexagonal stainless steel 38mm burrs.\n\n\n*M1 Racer Grinder Initial impression:*\n\n*Looks* are fantastic, with a compact, sleek design.\n\n\n*Feel:* Very sturdy, I must say; I don't feel that any cheap material has been used anywhere in the grinder. A double-barreled shaft gives a really smooth and enjoyable grinding experience.\n\n\n*Grind:* 9-12 for Turkish, 14-17 for espresso (I use 15 for bottomless shots), 24-30 for pour over; I haven't tried French press so far.\n\n\n*Time:* It takes about a minute to grind 14 gm for espresso, and 45 seconds to grind 16 gm for a pourover.\n\n\n*Static:* some static on the adjustment dial.\n\n\n*Cup:* syrupy, full-bodied textures, good overall flavour profile.\n\n\n*Knob:* stepped grind adjustment which go for multiple full rotations\n\n\n*Cleaning:* multiple full rotations of the adjustment knob will unlock the burrs, and have access to a deep clean.\n\n\n*Overall impression:*\n\nI'm quite happy with the grinder. It checks all the boxes for me. It's compact, build quality is awesome, easy to grind, and allows me to grind for multiple brew types.\nFor the price, I think it's perfect. I'll give it a 9/10.\n\nDo I recommend this grinder? Yes, for travel and to students or who are looking for something budget friendly.\n\n\nCheers from a rambling coffee noob!\n\n*Some Pics:*\n\nhttps://ibb.co/wBkXznz\n\nhttps://ibb.co/nbKwdsb\n\nhttps://ibb.co/dLTJf1j\n\nhttps://ibb.co/SnVfMCb\n\nhttps://ibb.co/n3CNN41\n\nhttps://ibb.co/Q86fCM4\n\n\nResult:\nhttps://streamable.com/b2lano\n\n\nStore link: \naliexpress.com/item/1005005072712522.html",

        "text": "Hi folks,\n\nfinally found &amp; solved an issue we had with our coffee machine Barista Express BES875 (which should be the same for different models Sage / Breville / Stollar when it comes to how they work)\n\nour coffee machine stopped pouring hot water from filter/ group head. steam and hot water had no issue at all. but once you brewed coffee - all the water went into the dip tray. I had to look up many different sources online and the most useful was from someone who figured how the water flows in the system [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lMw6ooiqPI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lMw6ooiqPI)\n\nwhile many people online suggested to change the solenoid, I took it apart and found that it had some scale on the coil/ valve. I cleaned it up with vinegar and it turns out that was the issue. apparently the scale affects the coil to pull the valve it has on the inside and to switch between hot water/ steam to group head\n\n(although I still don't get it why the water tray was full - maybe it went through steam/hot water passage instead of solenoid drain)\n\n!!! once the coffee machine was ok, I could hear the click sound when pressing 1/2 cup for brewing (which disappeared when it was faulty)\n\nanyway I will add some photos and sources, maybe some of you will find useful:\n\n1. water flow scheme photo ([https://wiki.jmehan.com/display/KNOW/Breville+Barista+Repair](https://wiki.jmehan.com/display/KNOW/Breville+Barista+Repair))\n2. how to disassemble coffee machine [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96IuKiuIB5A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96IuKiuIB5A)\n3. solenoid parts [https://www.espressoparts.com/blogs/barista-basics-tutorials/solenoids](https://www.espressoparts.com/blogs/barista-basics-tutorials/solenoids)\n4. replacement parts just in case [https://www.ereplacementparts.com/breville-bes870xl-the-barista-express-parts-c-116052\\_116055\\_290179.html](https://www.ereplacementparts.com/breville-bes870xl-the-barista-express-parts-c-116052_116055_290179.html)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vn7lcjr4mvja1.jpg?width=1183&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1f680b79674d36810769e140d992d4a7806ae438\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q6bbvqs4mvja1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=85afc0f475273cde8aec11fa99287faa85c16977\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9t4vqjr4mvja1.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4d9e0c4a2494ba0dafde4367b6a01c4b4682047d",
