When I scrolled through the comment section I noticed tons of similar comments from seemingly different accounts giving testimonials about how [leader of mentioned group] is their hero and how much he’s positively influenced their lives, how the leader isn’t a racist, how vice is misrepresenting the group, etc. There’s over 2k of these comments. Many of them are racist. \n\nSeems like it could be bots spamming the comments, people paid to comment or the member’s themselves commenting, but I can’t tell. It’s also worth mentioning Vice has done nothing about it. Most of these comments are 2 days old, but there’s still some being posted within the last few hours. \n\nAny ideas what’s going on here?\n\nLink: https://youtu.be/BGTlAE0dVnA",

Why does this seem to be happening all of the sudden post pandemic and to such a dramatic degree? Like yes, the pandemic stopped live music and it makes sense that the industry would want to recoop losses, but I don’t get how it makes sense to hold the average consumer accountable for a global pandemic outside of anyone’s control, and I certainly don’t understand why it’s not a more normal price increase per ticket, like 10 bucks or something. \n\n2.  Piggybacking off the first question. Why such huge dollar amounts?! I saw a pair of nosebleed Metallica tickets for $1500. What average person can pay this? Just doesn’t seem sustainable to me. And yes, I know some people can and will, but there are more regular folk than there are rich folk, so what’s the goal?\n\nMake it make sense.",
