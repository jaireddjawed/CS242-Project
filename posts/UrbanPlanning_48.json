Why is this?\nI have about a years worth of relevant transportation planning experience from my internship but I have no idea how they expect an entry level applicant to get that much experience.

        "text": "I'm conducting research on the flow of money into active transportation to get a better idea of which factors are most important to private and municipal organizations that allocate money to cycling transportation projects in the urban environment.\n\n\nI'd like to reach out to urban, community, and transportation planners to hear - which factors related to cycling will get the most funding attention in the next decade? Do you think it will be safety, infrastructure, social programming, or something else that will get the most attention? Do you feel there exists a priority at the local or national level for funding, i.e. will projects framed as \"improvements to safety\" get more money that projects framed as \"infrastructure\" or \"research\"?\n\n\nGiven the recent budget cuts to various programs (TIGER/LWCF) from the executive office, I'd like to hear where you think the major investments into cycling will be made at the local, regional, and federal level. The Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, signed in 2015 will continue to benefit active transportation at all levels in the United States. Programs like Transportation Alternatives, Highway Saftey Improvement Program, and the Surface Transportation Block Grant Program will continue to provide flexible funding to improve the safety, quality, and environment of active transportation. On top of this, many states, cities, and local communities will continue to invest their own resources into cycling.\n\n\nAlthough funding is available across the US for many kinds of projects, there exist major differences in how cities spend money (if at all) on cycling.\n\n\nWhat do you think the flow of money into and around cycling will look like in the next decade or so?\n\n",

I am a civil engineering student (concentrating within transportation engineering and minoring in urban design) who is contemplating two masters programs, both within my state's university system (yay, instate tuition!). \n\nThe first program is the [Masters of Regional Planning](https://www.umass.edu/larp/graduate/regional-planning-mrp) at my current university and the flagship, the University of Massachusetts Amherst. They offer the following concentrations: Community and Equity Planning, Land Use and Environmental Planning, Economic and Regional Development Planning or a Student Designed Concentration. The program is well established and accredited, although it is in a very rural part of the state and is a traditional program in that students are generally full-time and classes are taught throughout the day. This program would be a bit more expensive for me as I would have to continue paying for housing for two years, not to mention how boring it is in the western part of the state.\n\nThe second program is the [MS in Urban Planning and Community Development](https://www.umb.edu/academics/environment/grad/urban_planning_and_community_development_ms) at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. They offer the following concentrations: Environmental Planning, Community Development and Rebuilding Communites Post-Disaster. UMB is the urban, mostly commuter campus within the system. The program is only two years old and I do not think it is accredited yet, although I am not sure. As for pros of this mostly evening option, I would be able to live at home as I reside in the area, as well as work within the larger Boston economy. During this time, I would be able to pay back my 20k in student loans and progress my career.\n\nRight now, I am leaning towards the UMass Boston option, although I would love to hear from all of you. I just have a few questions.\n\n* How important is accreditation? How much longer does it take to become AICP certified?\n* How important would you say it is to be within a growing urban environment like Boston while studying Urban Planning?\n* How demanding are masters programs in Urban Planning? Is working a full-time job unrealistic?\n\nThank you everyone!  \n",

Perhaps replaced with some sort of \"social impact permits\" to prevent the odd case of say, industrial being built in a residential area.\n\n* Local Police could be replaced with a model similar to the territorial police in England &amp; Wales\n\n* Schools are generally already the prerogative of school districts in almost all of the US.\n\n* Parks could managed either directly by states, or directly by neighborhoods, as is already the case with many local parks.\n\n* Roads could be done through road districts\n\nOverall, I believe this would be a great way to reduce drag caused by city governments that can very often be corrupt, subject to the influence of NIMBY's and [rent seekers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking).

        "text": "My 2 year MA in Urban Planning at University at Buffalo (http://ap.buffalo.edu/academics/graduate-degrees/mup.html) begins next Monday. I'm excited to immerse myself in the planning world. My undergrad is in English, so I expect to have a bit of a learning curve. We have a few different specializations to choose from and I'm torn between \"Environmental and Land Use Planning\", \"Urban Design and Physical Planning\", \"Historic Preservation\", and \"Neighborhood Planning and Community Development\". I know that I'll get more insight into which of these may be the best fit for me once I actually start my core classes, but any recommendations/insight/advice on this matter would be much appreciated!",

Our streets, homes, power grids, and infrastructure just don't appear to be designed with a natural disaster in mind. As I talk to people around the country, this seems to come up quite often, their schools get shut down for the smallest amount of snow even if it happens every year. \n\nI'm curious if there are any books about how to plan a city so that it can continue to operate, and mitigate any problems, during a natural disaster. I'm sure that every location has their own issues, but it seems as though we are working from an old playbook that thinks of these things as \"acts of god\" rather than just weather events that we can overcome through proper engineering.",
