        "text": "I don't know if this fits or is too heavy (or cheesy!) for this sub, but I wanted to share. I'd suffered from anorexia most of my life, and it was especially bad when I was in my late teens-early twenties. What helped me get better was discovering a love of cooking mostly based on Kenji's recipes on Serious Eats. I developed skills and knowledge in the kitchen and came to be known among my friends and family as a very good cook. It made me very proud! I also reached a healthy weight.\n\nThen, about four years ago I got divorced and began living by myself. And the pandemic happened. And depression settled in. Once I was only cooking for myself, I just didn't have much motivation anymore. The ED came roaring back and for the past year or so, I've been struggling to get myself to eat. \n\nA few days ago, I was talking to my therapist and mentioned I enjoyed the involved, informed nature of his recipes, how I would feel so relaxed when cooking, and how it made me realize the joy of food. So I pulled out my copy of *The Food Lab* and decided to make biscuits and gravy, one of my favorite recipes from the book. For the first time in a very long time, I actually ate a whole portion of food. Then I made the easy weeknight chili and have been eating it for lunches at work (which I usually skip). Tonight, I'm tackling the meatballs and red sauce. \n\nI'm feeling so much better already and just more excited about life in general. Cooking is pulling me out of my ED and deep depression. I'm so thankful.\n\nI plan to get *The Wok* maybe next month when I have the money to do so. I just wanted to send a thank you out into the universe to Kenji and Serious Eats.",

I’ve noticed, however, in videos and the two preps I’ve done, that the resultant ragu bolognese sauce doesn’t stick to the egg based noodles as well, no matter how thick or velvety the sauce is. Delicious, but I think a better mouthfeel can be achieved:\n\nWas thinking of proceeding with the 3-4 hour braise and reduction as normal, but on the side, doing a hot skillet tomato paste, shallot, olive oil, and light cream “pink sauce” to lightly coat the noodles and then top them with the ragu. This would create a sharp yet light base layer on top of which the heavy ragu would sit, thus achieving greater sauce traction and a desirable dimensionality. \n\nThank you in advance for sense checking me here",

I tried to skim all of it out but I couldn’t get it all.

        "text": "Hey all! I’ve made these a few times, and think they’re a great weeknight meal. Tasty, healthy, very quick, reheat well, what more can you want! \n\nHOWEVER, the one thing that has stuck out to me is how adaptable these could be to other flavors, but I’m not fully sure what to add to accomplish these flavors. And I’d love to know if anyone has had success with other variations! My ideas so far:\n\n-\t“Bahn Mi” burgers. I would add cilantro, fish sauce, and top with shredded carrot/cucumber. Any other seasonings I could add to the burger? \n-\t“Greek” burgers. I was basically aiming for a chicken gyro type of situation. Really not sure what seasonings to add here, but it still sounds good! \n-\t“Buffalo Chicken” burger. Obviously you’d top with Buffalo sauce and blue cheese or pepper Jack, maybe some ranch on top too, but I’m still at a loss for seasonings! Celery salt? \n\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions here, or any other creative ideas? I’m planning to make this tonight and go the “Greek” route, but I might go the traditional route that Ethan Chlebowski has done, where you just mix in diced onions, chili powder, and paprika. Has a mild “middle eastern” type of flavor to me, very tasty!",

I stupidly used it on high heat and a bunch of the coating came off pretty quickly. Is this wok savable, if I just wipe off all of the non-stick coating? It is supposed to be a carbon-steel wok. \n\nI wish I hadn't bought it, and I only spent $20 thankfully. I'd rather try and salvage this if possible though. I'd like to be able to properly season it after removing the coating.",
