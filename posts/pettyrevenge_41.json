        "text": "I drive a city bus. This particular route has two different destinations. A longer one that terminates in a station at a mall, and a shorter one that goes to a college. Both mostly travel the same route, but the school trip deviates eventually by turning right and heading about a kilometer down a different road.\n\nOur buses have an electronic number board on the back, side, and front of the vehicle, the rear board only displays the number, and not the final destination like the other two. \n\nWe also have long accordion-style buses that we can open all 3 sets of doors on to allow large groups to board faster. Each door set has an electronic pass reader for those getting on there, and everyone is supposed to tap their pass as they board. \n\nSo I'm in an area of town known for a high number of scammers coming in the back doors without paying. We don't say anything, to avoid getting into confrontations that would stop the run or get us injured, plus they have Transit Police and fare inspectors who keep tabs on that sort of thing. Customers know that coming across a fare inspector is rare, though.\n\nSo one day at a stop, somebody gets off at the back door and I see a guy run from a nearby doorway and jump in the back door before it closes, and take a seat without paying. \nNow he's stolen a ride from me, and I'm forced to drive him to his destination which he thinks is going to be the mall station because all he could see from the back sign is the routing number, but not the destination. \n\nNormally just before I turn down the side street where this route deviates I make a courtesy announcement to all the customers letting them know that they are not on the right bus to go to the station, but rather on the bus to go to the college. \nOccasionally, I'll get the odd person who didn't hear the announcement, and at the end of the line I'll take them to the station while out of service, since I go there to begin my next trip anyway.\n\n Today, it was the regular few college students, and this one guy at the back. I decided not to make the announcement.\n\nWe turn, and begin heading down the street and I see him in the mirror start to perk up a bit and look around wondering where we're going. \nFinally the bus announces last stop and everybody gets off and he comes up and asks if I'm going to the station. I tell him No, this is the last stop and that he'll need to walk back up the main street to catch the other bus to the station. I hear him muttering curse words to himself as he exit, and I leave, heading right to the very station he wanted.\n\nI hope he enjoyed his long walk and took that time to consider paying his fare next time.",

Timmy has some sort of mental delay and is the sweetest dude to work with, if a little quiet. His dad would come in every day he worked to pick him up and buy something to go through the checkout. \n\nOf course on the day I’m off something exciting happens. This lady is going through the checkout and for whatever reason decides to start ripping the poor cashier a new one. Cashier is upset but continues to check her out because she doesn’t have much of a choice. Timmy happened to be bagging her groceries and oopsied the package of cupcakes the lady was buying into the bag upside down.   \nLady doesn’t notice immediately and winds up coming back to the customer service desk screaming for blood. The manager calls Timmy over and he has the most perfect look of blank innocence on his face as he ambles over.  \n\nTl;dr: lady was rude to the cashier and the bagger ruined her cupcakes by bagging them upside down",

        "text": "TD;DR: Customer tried to cheat me out of EUR40 hoping I would waive it. I didn't offer to and customer demanded a refund instead of admitting she wanted it as a discount. Refund would have costed more than EUR40 due to currency changes and bank charges.\n\nI sell pre-owned watches on a well-known watch webmarket. Recently the webmarket started charging a 2% commission for each sale in their own currency on top of a listing fee so my margins are slim as it is after converting EUR back to my own currency. Due to this, I have been selling my watches at nett price.\n\nI usually have plenty of customers try to pull a fast one, usually I straight up do not respond because of the sheer volume of scammers or people just being plain unreasonable. Things like \"ship the watch to me first since it is used. I need to see the condition first hand\" or \"Please bring to me in person, I am in Paris\" etc so I've pretty much seen all kinds of things people try to pull.\n\nAnyway, my customer, Susan*, has been very polite all the way with me throughout the transaction. We agreed on the price including shipping and currency conversion fee as my bank automatically exchanges any other currency transferred into my own, following their rates. Usually I never get the exact amount because rates go up and down daily, so sometimes I make a little more, but more often times I get less than my asking price, sometimes up to four digit numbers which is painful because I do not mark up my prices to stay competitive. Anyway, Susan agrees to my price and says please proceed and we make payment arrangements and now I'm just waiting for her payment proof.\n\nLo and behold when I received the payment slip she sent me less than what we have agreed. Granted it is a small amount but she caught me on a bad day and I just absolutely hate cheap customers who pulls these kind of tricks (not the first time) banking on the chance that I might not be calculative with her because it's a small amount (about EUR40) but that was almost half of the shipping fee and I am already making a lean profit. I thought perhaps it could be an honest mistake and I tried to ask for the balance. Typically I would just waive it. I mean, I just want her to say it that she wanted it waived to prove my point that she did it on purpose. Instead, she went all huffy and told me \"OK, then return the money to me when you receive it.\" perhaps thinking that would scare me into waiving it for her but not today. If you want it, you have to ask for it.\n\nSo I told her OK, I can do that. However, I will send it in my currency as that is how I will be receiving it, and also minus any other bank service charges incurred. That would mean a typical loss converting EUR to my currency + telegraphic transfer and service charge by my bank + converting my currency back to EUR + whatever charges that could be on her end if any. So in trying to save EUR40, she has lost lots more by asking for a refund. Oh the satisfaction I got as I saw her typing and typing away wording her respond to me. After what felt like 20 minutes, she finally sent \"You want to break the deal over EUR40?\" So I told her \"oh no. I definitely don't. It's just that you asked for a refund, so I had to comply. If you wanted me to waive it, you could have just asked; I asked for the balance because we both agreed on the price and your payment was not complete yet.\"\n\nIn the end she said \"OK, Can't you waive the EUR40 as a little discount? I am also interested in buying a few more watches from you\" (they hardly do) which I responded with \"Yes I would be happy to\". Non-climactic ending. I always put up with customers like these so it was nice to just comply maliciously for once. It's petty but that felt good!",

While waiting for the train to arrive, people would gather where we all knew the train doors would be when the train stopped, and that way the people who got there early could get on the train first and have their choice of seats. There was a yellow line on the pavement to warn people no to stand too close to the tracks, and people dutifully lined up behind this line.  \n\nThis all works well until some entitled bitch decides that when she shows up, she will just walk in front of everyone and stand in the lead spot. In order to do so, she needs to stand in front of the yellow line. For weeks, I saw her push back behind the line as the train approached, and the other commuters, being nice people, let her in despite her antics. \n\nWell the day finally came when she decided to cut in front of me. As the train got closer and closer to the station, she tried to back up, but I wasn't having it; I stayed put. I could tell she was getting nervous, as she kept pressing back harder and harder. Finally as the train started to pass us, I press forward and push her within about 8 inches of the passing train. Not extremely dangerous, but enough to freak her out somewhat.     \n\nI can't say if she ever pulled her trick again, but she certainly didn't do it to me again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Its not quite a revenge story, more of a failed revenge, but I'd still love to share it. - \n\nSo my Grandfather was a banker back in his day, British but worked for some time at the Bank of India. With the economies back then, he was much better off in the country than the majorities, so he had servants and the like.\n\nHe always liked his whiskey, but he often thought the servants would drink some and he began to get suspicious, so he decided to mark the bottle. He knew if he drew a line at the water-level it would be obvious, so he turned the bottle upside down and drew a line where the whiskey came up to instead. \n\nThe next day, he turned the bottle over and the level had dropped. He was furious, and decided to teach the servant a lesson. He poured half the bottle out and filled it back up with piss. When he arrived home from work the next day, low and behold, the level and dropped. He sniggered as he knew it served him right and decided he would show him up that night at dinner when he had guests there. \n\nDinner comes and my Grandfather tells his guests about his scheme and they await eagerly for the roasting. As the suspected servant clear away desert, a trifle, layers upon layers of sponge, jam and cream and topped with an assortment of fruits, my Grandfather takes his as his opportunity. \n\nGrandfather: \"So I see you've been stealing my whiskey then, what do you have to say for yourself?\" \n\nServant: \"No sir, I promise I haven't!\" \n\nGrandfather: \"Don't lie to me, I marked the level and its dropped, nobody else could have had any but you\" \n\nServant: \"Oh, no sir, I didn't drink any, I put it in the trifle\"",

        "text": "Edit: TL;DR: The checkout lady at a store rang my small order out in slow motion while internally laughing at me. So when she was done having her fun, I paid in slow motion. She did not find that funny. \n\n\nI was standing in a checkout line at a department store and the woman working the cash register was taking care of the customer in front of me. \n\nThe cashier suddenly noticed that the previous customer had left a bag behind so she shouted out, grabbed the bag, and ran after her. I only mention this so anyone reading this knows that this woman did not have a disability or anything that made her move slowly. \n\nAnyway, it comes my turn to check out and I had a thing in my cart that I just decided at the last second I wasn’t going to get. I very politely asked her if she had a bin under her register for things going back to the shelves. I asked her nicely if she wouldn’t mind putting he item in there for me cause I decided not to get it. She seemed outwardly OK, but something on her face told me that I had just really annoyed her. Just like, this weird prolonged eye contact as she reached for my other things. It was then that she started her petty passive aggressive revenge on me. \n\nIt’s hard to really put into words how slowly and robotically she began to move. She reached in slow motion for each item on the belt as if she were covering a great distance with her arm. She would pick it up in front of her, pause, then run it slowly across the sensor. Then crush it up slowly and firmly into a tiny little ball (clothing) and place it in the bag. I bought about seven items, and it took her several agonizing minutes to ring these things up. \n\nAnd the whole time she was doing it she was clearly trying to stop herself from laughing. This ridiculous shit eating grin was on her face the whole time as if it was all she could do to keep herself from bursting out laughing. It took me a few moments of watching this to realize, “What the heck, this lady is doing this on purpose to troll me.” I just waited patiently because I knew how ridiculous I would look if I told her to hurry up. But my face burned with embarrassment as I tried to understand why she was acting like this. (I know this sounds really stupid, but it kinda hurt my feelings? I was nothing but nice to her, and she was really taking delight in my discomfort and confusion.) I knew she was doing it on purpose and it was totally getting my goat. \n\nI worked in customer service for about a half a dozen years, and I was a waitress for about 10 years. I know exactly how all these games work. \n\nSo now comes my petty revenge... I’m a pretty fast mover, walker etc. So when the transaction is nearing completion at a store, I punch in my code, slide my card, tuck it back in my wallet, get my receipt, thank the person, and get out of their way. Always quickly. Never rudely, I just want to get out of their hair and I usually have somewhere to be.\n\nBut this time, I stared at the number pad as if it was a foreign language, I took about eight times longer than I normally would to punch in my code, then let the little machine ding at me for a few rounds before I slowly pulled my card out. \n\nAt this point, she’s standing there with a receipt in her hand holding it out in front of my face, kind of shaking it at me. I slooooowly tuck my card back in my wallet and secured that. At this point she says, “Here..” to try to get me to take the receipt. And I turn and reach out my hand to her in very... slow... motion... to get the receipt. \n\nI thanked her, and continued to move in slow motion as I pick my bags up and slowly waddled away.\n\nI’m not even 100% sure that she noticed what I was doing. (Though I certainly hope so.) I could’ve gone much, much slower. However, there were people waiting in line behind me, and I just couldn’t be that rude to them. And if I go back to that store and find myself in her line again, I will move even slower.",

I proceeded to stand as tight up against the table so she couldn't get access to her purse to put her phone away.  When she walked away I would back off and just watch waiting for her to come back and pretend like I needed to adjust my songs and playlist every time she came back to put her phone away.  She finally just left her phone on the table but shortly after came back to grab it and kept waiting for me to move which, I didn't need to dance or anything so I stayed put.

I'd never been happier.\n\nI don't keep my deafness a secret, all my coworkers know about it and whenever they need to talk to me they move to my left side, and even asked me to teach them some sign so they could say basic things to me without having to move far, I mean extremely basic single words like pepperoni, help etc. This became an important dynamic in work that she refused to co-opt into because it was hard, and instead decided to stay on my deaf side and yell at me until I figured out what she wanted, often calling it a time waster to my coworkers thinking I wouldn't find out, I did. This was strike one.\n\nStrike two was when I was on the phone to a customer (obviously the phone was in my good ear) and Assface tried speaking to me when I COULDN'T hear because 1) hey I'm talking to a customer and 2) I am DEAF. I made a vague hand signal asking her to wait and instead of waiting 2 minutes, she huffed and I thought I heard her say 'deaf bitch' behind me, but put it to my annoyance, but it was confirmed by a coworker, if I could hear it, she didn't whisper it.\n\nThe third and final strike was when I was serving a friend over the counter, who is fully deaf, I was signing to take her order which obviously took a little longer than if it was verbal, but that literally doesn't matter. It took about 5 minutes to take her order which isn't even that long, when I'm done Assface turns to a coworker and says loud enough for me to hear 'what a waste of time why couldn't she just try to say her order we have things to do.' Exactly that. I was furious, making fun of my deafness was fine but making fun of someone who was fully deaf and literally could not 'say' their order, I wanted to scream.\n\nThis is where I take my revenge. At the end of the night we usually throw our hairnets away, I wait till she does and I dig it out from the trash and take it home. The next day before I go to work I take a handful of her hairs from the hairnet and put them in my pocket, gross I know. Then when it gets to the rush I put some of her hairs in various pizzas (I made sure no one was going to eat these) and put them in the oven, when I went to cut those pizzas I put them to the side and told the delivery drivers not to take them because something was wrong with them. Cut to the end of the rush I take the ruined pizzas to my manager and open them showing him the hair, and then I leave.\n\nThe next day I come in I hear Assface has been suspended because of multiple complaints and inadequate hygiene. To top it all off she asks me to be her reference for a different job, I say sure and when they phone me asking me about her work ethic I tell them all about audism. Good luck trying to get that Subway job, Assface.\n\n**Tl;dr**: Girl made fun of my deafness so I put her hair in the food and got her fired.\n\nEdit: Assface didn't need the job, her parents are rich she just worked there so the college would allow her more time off.",

        "text": "It was way back in 6th grade. It was at the point where my parents were starting to leave me home alone. They wanted me to have some life skills to use while fending for myself in those hours, i.e. answering the phone, basic electronic troubleshooting, and cooking, so they encouraged me to take Home Economics as an elective. Agreeing, I did.\n\nI was especially excited to learn about cooking--I could use a microwave, get snacks, and mix ingredients to bake, but I had little clue about how to cook with a stove or oven. We went over emergency plans, laundry, etc., until we finally got to the cooking unit.\n\nNow, due to the actual amount of stoves in the room, we were each assigned into groups of five or six. Due to my shy nature, I was constantly overlooked by my group. Each of us would have to perform a task in the recipe, with the idea being that each of us would have a turn with everything. I never got to use the oven, or the stove, or even hold a pan. Due to my shy nature, I didn't speak up.\n\nUntil the last day. We were making scrambled eggs. I tried to convince my group to let me use the stove, but they resisted, pointing to my inexperience. They instead forced me to get the salt and pepper.\n\nI was livid. I took this class for one damn reason, and they stripped me of my opportunity. But unbeknownst to them, they had placed Godlike power in my hands, more so than if they had just let me use the stove. Plotting my revenge even as I was lamenting, I stepped up to the desk where every group measured their salt and pepper. I knew that we got to eat our group's finished recipe. I knew what I had to do.\n\nAs I returned, I quickly threw the spices into the pan before my group could protest. \"That...looks like a bit too much pepper,\" the lucky kid who forced me out of using the stove said as he gazed down in his pan. \"Is it?\" I responded, \"I'm pretty sure I measured it correctly.\"\n\nWhen we plated our scrambled eggs, everyone stared in disgust at the blackened mass of flat, unappetizing eggs. We took our plates and ate. It was bitter; so bitter, that everyone dejectedly and disappointingly threw their plates away within a couple of bites. That is, except for me. I hecking love pepper, and the taste that danced on my tongue was the sweet, sweet taste of revenge.",

I usually call ahead to let them know that I'm coming, I always try to be friendly, and get there pretty fast.\n\nMalia or whatever her name is has ordered a whopping 6 XL pizzas with a shit ton of toppings. I have to deliver these pizzas to her party at a hotel that's 5 minutes away. Her total came to about $150, and because she ordered online she already gave me my tip, which I can see. You probably can guess why I'm writing this by just that. *FOUR FUCKING DOLLARS*\nFor you math nerds that's a whole 2.67% on a big ass order.\n\nSo I get to the party and find Malia and ask where she wants them, and has me go all the way around to the back where I can unload them. Now, if you have never had our pizza delivered, we carry the pizzas in an insulated bag so that the pizza remains hot. In order to take them out, we usually slide them out horizontally so as to not lose any toppings or make the cheese all go to one side. Well, Malia doesn't know that and I take all the pizzas out vertically and add a little shake to get the bag completely off. I lay each box on a table and promptly walk out before I hear any cries of anguish. \n\n",

Being the individual to exit first, I used my most polite voice and allow everyone else to get off the bus first. Every single person. At one point she attempts to get my attention, to no avail.

        "text": "It'll look like a rant, and it is, a bit. But revenge was fun.\n\nThis summer I organized a week out with some friends. We were looking for something cheap, as they study and don't have money for camping or b&amp;b, so our dad offered to host us in his vacation house in Trentino, 8 hours drive from our city, in the region where I was born and where I lived until 6 and spent like all summers of my life until 16. I told him we were 5(4 boys, one girl), he hesitated a bit at first, as he was alone there for like 3 months, but then condescended.\n\nThe house have 2 rooms upstairs and a large living room downstairs, 2 bathrooms, not so big for 6 people but well, it's a vacation, you're doing your son a favor, you can live up to it for 6 days.\n\nWe get there by Sunday evening, we meet our dad, he's smiling and happy to meet my friends, as they all are chill and fun people, we all smoke joints, even my dad, so there was this easy and laid back atmosphere, everything was fine.\n\nHe already knew one of my friends(AM), who is a little absent-minded, so he started making puns on him, friendly at first, a bit offensive later, starting to criticise what he studies, saying that he's demented and not so nice things, but we laughed a bit on that, thinking that he was acting.\n\nWhen he's in vacation in Trentino, he likes to go hiking in the morning, we agreed on it, so on Tuesday morning we woke up early, got ready and went hiking. We got back by 4pm as it was getting cloudy and rainy, we cooked, relaxed and my dad went to dine at a friend's restaurant in the evening.\n\nHe came back and went upstairs to read and sleep, so we stayed a bit downstairs quietly chatting and playing Yahtzee.At about 00.30 he rushes downstairs saying with a super-rude tone something like \"If you came here to do what the fuck you want, leave the fuck out and go back home\", and rushed out to smoke.\n\nWe were astonished, no one got why he did this, it was clearly an overreaction for us chatting too loud, so there must have been something behind... After a minute of stun by his outburst I go out at him to figure out what was wrong, but even though I repeatedly asked him for an explanation, if something was wrong with our behaviour, of course it's your house, yours are the rules, but all he can say is \"Your friends are all morons, pack your things and leave tomorrow morning. \"He goes upstairs to sleep, I get back at my friends, talk a couple of minutes of what happened, and we all go to sleep.\n\nIn the morning after we wake early with the intention of going hiking with him again, thinking that the night before was an ultimatum, \"behave good or leave\". I go downstairs for breakfast and as AM gets downstairs my dad gets back home and start insulting him, getting personal. He repeatedly told us to leave, I faced him with the fact that this week was the only one I had as vacation from work, but he didn't bat an eye. He said one last time to leave and to \"take the onions away\" (we bought some onions, he doesn't like onions). I started crying of rage after that, as I couldn't face with the fact that he behaves like that in front of my friends, ruining my vacation without even giving us the chance to fix it, without an explanation more that \"I don't like your friends\" (to be said, some of his youth friends died of heroin, he got his law degree in like 8 years out of 5 needed, so he showed the most hypocrite side of himself).\n\nAfter that fight, he leaves home, and we start packing our stuff. I get on phone with my mother, as I needed some support on that. She tells me that he's like that, \"He gets mad when you move the air around him\", meaning that he's bound to his habits and gets mad when something changes.\n\n'nuff said, revenge is planned in my mind.\n\nI get back inside, and went fully autistic. I methodically start opening every pantry, every closet, and gently put everything on the ground, dismantling it if possible, making the ground FULL of stuff, clothes, sealed food, opened bottles, jars and PLATES. A lot of plates. Ground floor is filled with plates from right behind the door, his room is filled with his clothes, bathroom is filled with bottles, razors, towels.   \nThen I thought of his last words \"take the onions away\", so I start peeling them, putting one right next to each soap bar, scrubbing it inside his shoes, on his toothbrush, and putting a couple inside his pillow. I finish by putting a note on the table, \"Thank your for your hospitality, I'm going back home, hope you have fun here, enjoy your stay\". What I hope with the revenge is that in the hours he spent tidying up, he question himself on WHY I reacted like that, and if maybe, perhaps, there was another way to send us away without having to fight with your son in front of his friends.\n\n​\n\nTL;DR: My dad invites me and friends to vacation, we stay a couple days, he kicks us out with no explanation insulting my friends, I rub onion all over his stuff and get his place turned over.\n\na friend took a photo after i emptied the first cupboard:[https://imgur.com/sFmhNxD](https://imgur.com/sFmhNxD)",

        "text": "This happened about 15 years ago, when I was a Naval Officer. My fellow officer “Amy” and I were tasked with arranging an Change of Command ceremony for an 0-6, with less than two weeks’ notice. For those who don’t know, an 0-6 is a fairly high ranking officer (Colonel in Army/AF/USMC, Captain in the Navy), and a CoC is a fairly large deal that usually takes a couple of months to plan. We had to secure a venue, invite all the out-of-town VIPs, arrange lodging for said VIPs, arrange for catering, the works.\n\nSo, we immediately go to the on-base printing center to get the programs done. They write down the work order, give us a copy, and tell us to call in a few days. Amy and I are busy with the other arrangements, so we task an Admin Petty Officer to check back with them daily. Every day we get “not done yet”. \n\nFinally it’s the morning before the ceremony and no programs in sight. Amy and I head down to the printing center, work order in hand, to ask WTF is going on? The lazy civilian bitch behind the counter (sorry, but civvies working for the military can be some of the laziest fucks out there) pulls out a pile of work orders, looks through it, and says “Uh, it looks like we lost your work order.”  \nI ask, “So, now that you know about it, you can get it done by the end of today, right?”  The LCB goes “Sorry, there’s a lot of orders before yours, we can’t do that.”\n\nI’m sorry, WHAT? Wrong answer. My order was in two weeks ago, it damn well better jump to the front of the line. But, like I said, these are civilians working for the military, and they’re both lazy and untouchable. Mostly…\n\n“So, what’s your name?” LCB gives her name. “And the phone number here?” She tells me, I write it down. “And the manager’s name?” She gives it to me, and then asks why I need it. \n\n“Because tomorrow, at the Change of Command, which will involve several 0-6s and at least one Admiral, I’m going to put something on the seats. It can be our program, or a sheet of paper saying ‘For programs, contact LCB and her manager at the printing office’. Your choice.”\n\nLCB damn near has a heart attack, and finally calls her manager up. He tries to play it off and make excuses about how long it will take them, and I’m like “Dude, it’s an 8-page bifold saddle-stitch, from a Microsoft Office template that’s already filled in. You have to press one button on your machine, and it will dispense them, collated and bound, in about 20 minutes. We’ve wasted more time arguing about it.” As it happened, I was a journalism major, and knew just enough printing lingo to shut him up.\n\nAt that point my Petty Officer shows up, and I let her handle the rest. She comes back to the office about 30 minutes later asking “What did you DO??? They were all asking me how I could work with such a heinous bitch!”  Funnily enough, I was known as one of the more laid-back officers in the command, so she was totally confused. \n\nThe next morning, each seat had a shiny new program on it. I still have my copy. :)\n\nEdit: To clarify, I didn't go off because just because they lost the work order. I went off because they made ZERO effort to fix it. If she'd just said \"we're really sorry, we'll put that at the top of the list\", things would have been fine. To contrast, earlier that day we dealt with a venue that suddenly decided to redo the floors the day before the ceremony. We talked to the workers, they met us halfway by agreeing to do the critical portions that morning so we could rehearse that evening, and we bought them lunch. :)",

        "text": "I tried submitting this to the main website but there are a lot of submissions there before they get posted, so I decided I would tell my tale here. \n\nWarning, this is long. \n\nThere was this guy in my church, he seemed to be in his mid 20s. Let's call him Nitwit. He treated the church lunch as an all-you-can-eat buffet, and this pissed off everyone who spent a part of their Saturday cooking for the post-service lunch. It was a 'bring a plate' lunch and he brought nothing. Although people who didn't bring anything were welcome to take some food, they had to be considerate to leave some for others as there was a limited amount. But not Nitwit, not ever. He piled his plate to high heaven and even DARED to come back for seconds. There wasn't enough food for even the members of our church who let the visitors go first. Taking a lot more food than necessary was common in other visitors as well, but what made Nitwit that much more special was that he did not even attend the morning service anymore like he used to. I guessed he went to another church that taught what he liked to hear (he was a super sensitive piece of sh\\*t) and came to our church for 'free lunch.' Showing up at exactly lunchtime at 11, he couldn't be ruder to us. He had a stable job and could provide for himself, so you would wonder why he couldn't just make his own food or eat out, because the church lunch was only for attendees. He was a total ass, and whenever we went to rest home services, he'd say something along the lines of, 'These people are senile, its a blessing we were given the opportunity to visit them.' This was absolute BS because not all people in a rest home are senile and I was annoyed at this. \n\nI said to him, \"How can you know that?\"\n\nHe then challenged me, \"All mental old people are put in a rest home, right?\"\n\n\"It's not that way,\" I replied. \n\n\"How do you know that? Prove it.\" \n\n\"Mental people are put in the local sanitorium, not here. If you don't believe me, you can find out when you get put in one. You're older so you can find it out sooner than me.\" \n\nHe shut up. No one heard me because I said the last quote quietly. \n\nHe smelled like Jabba's asshole, and honestly sometimes the odor suffocated those nearby, but he didn't try to fix it. He made homophobic remarks that made me quite angry. I'm Christian and have a few friends in the LGBTQI+ community who I'm all cool with, and what he said was wrong and unjustified. He thought his interpretations of the Bible were right and was very sensitive to correction. He forced his opinions on everyone else, and when I brought my lesbian friend to church (she was curious about what made me get along with homosexuals), I overheard him say some snarky comment, something like, \"Why did she bring that &lt;not nice words&gt; here?\" No one else had a problem with her, they were all generally friendly. My lesbian friend heard it as well and was pissed. \n\nThis was the last straw. My friend and I planned a revenge to bring him down worse than he brought down himself. \n\nWe found out where he worked, and found a video on his work website. After some video editing, we made the masterpiece of destruction. The first 10 or so seconds on the video showed a bird's eye view of the construction site he was doing, and that part would play very quietly. The only way he would be able to hear it was if he played it on high volume. After the ten seconds, we inserted a clip of two humans making sounds in sexual pleasure. Specifically, two males. The second part was edited so it could be played on really high volume. \n\nWe sent a fake text from his manager's number (which was on the website) and it said that it was an emergency. This was on one of the rare Sundays he decided to attend our morning service. He opened it and bent down so no one would see he was on his phone, and we saw him press the + volume button for about 5 seconds. Then, \"F\\*\\*\\* me harder\" and the sound of other things filled the hall. He was shocked and speechless as he tried to get the volume lower, but not before everyone in the building heard. The preacher was speechless, and so was everyone. My friend and I tried to look sombre. Nitwit was offered counselling, and tried to refuse, but the would seem fishy if he didn't, so he had to. \n\nMy friend high-fived me in class and we told the story to our other friends. \n\nThis was when I was a new Christian and I would think twice, even three times, before doing that kind of thing. But I'm not regretful of that because felt like it gave me ten years. Whenever me and my friend think about it, we just giggle. ",

        "text": "Today, I went on a date with my boyfriend in NYC. We're not locals but we're not dumbasses either. On our way back to Penn station, we had to go through thick pedestrian traffic. The sidewalk was crowded and crossing it was like walking through a herd of sheep. Then I realize why it was dense. There was a group of 5 or 6 people right in the middle of the sidewalk. They seriously did not realize there was a crowd of people trying to walk around them. They just leisurely stood their, talking and not even making room for people to pass. \n\nI got mildly annoyed, but just mildly. I decided to lightly bump the closest person from the group. Not enough to shove them, enough to slightly annoy them. The closest one was the scrawny ginger guy. Couldn't have been more than 17 yrs. I lightly bumped his arm and I swear his arm only moved about an inch. But his ass decided to drop his can of diet dr pepper. He spilled like 5 sips of it. I honestly did moot mean to do that so I said sorry. As I walked away he was like, \"Are you serious?\" Like dude, do you still not see the crowd of people trying to pass through. It's not like I can get on my knees and apologize and buy pay for your diet dr pepper. \n\nI walked on and when I was about 5 feet away he said, louder in his nasal voice, \"ARE YOU SERIOUS?\" Um, yes my apology was serious. Not anymore though. His sister also started to say something but I dont know if it was directed to him or me. I didn't care anyway. If you're gonna stand in the middle of a crowded sidewalk, you can at least hold your shit tight enough. \n\nTL;DR: Some guy stood in the middle of a busy sidewalk and dropped his drink when I lightly bumped him.

        "text": "So some background. At the school I went to from 6th-11th grade, concert band was for kids grade 8 and up. The concert band met Monday-Thursday in the early morning, and we were required to play at least twice for basketball games as the pep band. I had very few friends the entire time I was at the school, most of them were way older and graduated long before me. I was also one of 10 girls in the 60 person concert band, and played the flute, which was considered one of the worst instruments to play for some reason.\n\nThere was this kid that played percussion, let's call him M. He had perfect/absolute pitch, which is when you can tell what pitch anything is without using a tuner. And it annoyed the crap out of him if someone was out of tune. He'd be constantly correcting us all throughout class. I don't have perfect pitch, but I've got some pretty good general pitch so I was luckily saved for the most part from his comments. My friend Bob sat next to me and played the flugelhorn, and we'd constantly complain about M to each other.\n\nSo. When I was in 8th grade, we played pep band for a varsity boys home basketball game. I made friends with some of the away team before the game, so I was rooting for their team rather than the home team. Unfortunately, M noticed this and proceeded to call me a Nazi, slut, moron, traitor, etc. As you can probably guess, I didn't take too kindly to that. Neither did Bob. For the rest of the year, we both played slightly out of tune during morning classes. If the conductor went through everyone one by one to see who was out of tune, we played just fine. But as soon as everyone was playing together, we were slightly flat or slightly sharp. It drove M insane.",

        "text": "In high school i only had 5 good friends, the same 5 since 1st grade. One year i only shared a lunch period with 1 friend (Lets call her M). M was a good friend but she was super social and desperately trying to climb the social ladder. So she was constantly trading friend groups (we always stuck together though). Since she was the only person i knew i had no choice but to sit with her or alone. BUT she sat with 3 bitches. So i chose to sit with them.\n\nThe biggest bitch, who i will refer to as BB, absolutely hated me. They all sucked, except M, and did not like me. They were all mean to each other because they didnt know how to make friends or keep them. BB was terribly spoiled. Nothing was her fault. She failed math because the teacher sucked, she forgot her homework because her mom didnt pack it and the like. They talked mad shit on their own friends as soon as they were out of ear shot so i am sure they talked about me too. 2 of them were as polite to me as they knew how to be but it was still obvious that they didnt like me, which was fair (not everyone likes everyone at least they were cordial and respectful to my face). \n\nBut BB suuuuucked. She would pretend to not hear me. She wouldnt talk to me and turn her head if i spoke to her. She was rude to me to my face, would not so subtly make fun of me and got the others to ignore me too by making sure the conversations always had something to do with things i knew nothing about, like certain people I'd never met, shows i didnt watch, classes i didnt have, topics i kbew nothing about.\n\nM's birthday came up so i made chocolate cupcakes and i baked dirt into one of them. I decorated each differently so i had an excuse to make sure that each girl got a specific cupcake to ensure that it wouldnt be weird when i told BB she had to eat a certain one. (She wanted a different ons and fought me on it for a minute, which i thought was rude, i custom made you a gift l, take it and say thank you). She then complained that hers was dry (also rude, bitch i gave you a gift be grateful), everyone else was like, \"oh, really? Mine was pretty moist\". Then after lunch i told EVERYONE what i did. She continued being the same level of bitch all year but she never told on me to the principal (there was no way that she didnt know l, i told too many people for it to not get back to her.)",

He picked up poop with his bare hands, only ate food if it was named after harry potter things, was going blind, wore harry potter glasses, had a middle part, practiced a religion that his mom made up, and so much more. Looking back i regret treating him like a burden and giving in to treating him like a freak. But everyone universally hated him. He had no idea, he would just talk non stop and was oblivious to those around him. Telling him that you didnt like him and that you wanted him gone was only an invitation to him to turn your oppinion around.\n\nI waited until he walked in and said, \"here, have my seat, i was just getting up to get my lunch\" he was very grateful and started talking immediately to everyone.

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year of High School, Brazil 2015.\n\n​\n\nI met this girl in my class and we dated for 6 months, after that she tried to betray me with my best friend, during those 6 months she was always trying to hook up with him and I was too blinded and naive to see. Hell, even him told me that he wasant feeling confortable around her but I did not listen, I was dumb. One day he came to me, showed me her texts trying to put him against me, asking him to date him and ditch me and he said that she tried to kiss him when we and a feel friends decided to go watch a movie, he was begging that I believed him before I thought that he was the one trying to take her from me. The evidence was too big and I realized what she was doing on my back. I was devastated, depressed and above all, vengefull.\n\n​\n\nI didnt confront her about it, I kept my head cool and carefully planned my revenge. It was november and she just had gotten the news, she was about to flunk and if she were not to be able to get a 60% score on her final Math exam. That also meant that even tho she wanted to go to a Literature College (that requires 0 knowledge on Math), she would have to get that Math grade to get a High School Degree to be able to enroll. Soo my 2 step plan was set in motion.\n\n​\n\nFirst, she still was with me while we studied in December for her final math test, btw for context in the South Hemisphere Winter happens during July and Summer during December soo the school year starts in February and ends in December, anyway I basically teached her a bunch of wrong math formulas and generaly told her she was doing great while she wasant learning anything. Came the test and she got a big and round 0! (Well, actually 0,3 ou of 10 but shhhh).\n\n​\n\nAfter that all she wanted to do was cry on my arms, and thats when I ghosted her. I figured that she would suffer more if she never knew what caused myself to vanish. And soo me and my friend blocked her on all social media, and since we both were done with High School, we would never cross her path again, since she would be doing that last high school year again while we were to be studying in university. That was the end of step 1.\n\n​\n\nNow, In my country Brazil university is \"free\", all you gotta do is pass on their entrance exam \"ENEM\". I managed to get aproved on a History Bachelor on one of the best universities of Brasil (if not Latin America), and my school (One of the many Catholic Private Schools from the La Salle brotherhood) called me asking if It would be ok for them to take my pictures and put my face on outdoors across the city to advertize the school. Basically my face, alongside me name and my aproval on one of the best universities of the country on big outdoors for everyone to see. Everyone including her that would have to walk from home to school everyday seeing my face and reminding her of where I am and where she is for the rest of the year. That was Step 2, my school always did this with students that got aproved on the top universities like UFF, UERJ, USP and UNICAMP, soo I studied extra hard to not only get a good education, but also to get myself on those outdoors.",

Some girl, we’ll call her Petty Bitch, comes up screaming in our faces how this was a private party...no one she didn’t invite was allowed, and how we owed her money for the three sips of jungle juice we had had between Mel and myself. \n\nMel and I leave because well we didn’t exactly feel welcome but I was PISSED. There was a ton of underage drinking happening at the party and they were located in a residential house (so off campus) in a pretty affluent part of town. \n\nI called the cops and reported all the underage drinking and got the party broken up. \n\nIt was quite satisfactory watching the cops show up and send everyone home from my car like a creeper!",

        "text": "**A little background before I start:** Late last year my family helped out some friends of their by letting them move in. They wound up staying permanently instead of leaving when they were supposed to. The people's children (10f + 8m) are absolutely the most disrespectful little shits I've ever met. They lie about everything, start drama in the house with these lies, steal, and they're mean to my retardedly sweet german shepherd. Despite this, family says \"be patient with them, dovahbah. They're just kids. Speak with the parents.\" I always speak with the parents, and they always enable the child's behavior.\n\n​\n\n**What happened:**\n\nEarly this morning I caught the boy doing something a family member asked them not to do, so I said (very politely, might I add) \"Hey, kiddo! Didn't (family member) ask you not to do that?\" Left it at that and went about my business. In the next room, plain as day, I hear him mocking me, then insulting me. Being that today was already a day of high stress due to a certain happening, I couldn't let this go unpunished.\n\nI noticed the kids were both watching the Roku, and unfortunately for them I have the Roku app on my phone. I opened it and started changing the app being used, sending the volume to my phone, going to the homescreen, etc. The boy believes the girl is messing with him as it's \"his turn\" (no one gave them permission to use my television today, nor family member's Roku), so he begins screaming at her. Her, having done nothing, screams at him. They begin fighting, tell their parents on one another, get yelled at by their parents, then go back into the living room crying.\n\nOnce the boy realizes girl isn't lying about messing with the Roku, they're now both worried they broke it. They turn it off and switch it to cable. Again, unfortunately for them, I have the DirecTV remote on my phone as well. About 45 minutes of changing channels, turning the box off, going to the menu, and etc, they get up and tell me that the cable box is acting up. I assure them the cable box is fine because \"I don't see anything wrong. Everything looks good. If you guys broke my TV though, since you said Roku was doing it too, imagine how mad your parents are going to be when I give them the bill for my TV....\"\n\nNot too bright, they go into the room and tell on each other that they broke the TV. Arguing ensues about who used it last, what they did, and what \"broke it\", and eventually they're yelled at, spanked, and grounded.\n\nNow, the living room is free, there's no screaming in there like there always is, and revenge was served.\n\nPart of me feels like \"way to be an adult about it\", but overall, I'm sick of these disrespectful little shits, and their horrible parents. If I had the money to move, I would, but til then... that Hulu and DirecTV app is going to keep making appearances.\n\n​**EDIT:** Said kids were watching Hulu when I meant to say they were using the Roku box. I kept switching it to Hulu, so I mean, yeah, *they kinda were watching Hulu*, but whatever. The error was bugging me when my husband was reading what I put, so I had to go back and fix it.",

I don't really remember why she decided to come up to me in the hallway to tell me she didn't like me but things happen - even for no reason. Okay cool, I've never talked to her anyways (which also made me confused on why she'd tell me that). I kind of enjoy the fact that the layout of all the students emails at our school are the same because it makes it easy for someone to get/place unwanted/inappropriate emails in others' school emails. I got home that day and was hanging out with one of my friends and again, don't know why I thought of this but I decided to sign up her school email address to a few old British granny porn websites which ended up sending her pretty explicit emails. The computer teacher has access to all students computers even w/out actually having their laptops in front of her so she ended up seeing these explicit emails on this girl's email address. She ended up getting a couple detentions for it and some other kid got in trouble for it somehow.\n\nWe're friends now :)",

        "text": "I live in Michigan, so we have a system that allows your state issued ID to let you across the border. I need this service as I’m going to Toronto soon. So, I go to the ninth circle of he- I mean... the DMV to get a state ID. (I don’t drive.) \n\nMy only other ID is my old learner’s license from Florida, but it’s a Real ID and has never given me problems when it comes to any sort of paperwork. Immediately the woman at the document check tells me my permit won’t do because it’s not an actual ID. \n\nIn Florida, learners permits are actually just Licenses with a ‘class E’ restriction that’s lifted after three months and logged driving during the day, during the night, and on the highway. It had all the security features of a true state issued ID, and even had my organ donor designation on it. It had the gold star indicating it was federally approved for the REAL ID system. (The only reason I hadn’t switched yet was because I fly domestically so often and Michigan hadn’t added the star to their ID’s yet.) So, by all accounts, it was a state ID. I also had a school ID, my social, my birth cert, and a ton of other documentation. \n\nI asked to speak to a manager who told me to ‘get out of her face’ and they left me crying in the DMV, concerned I would have to cancel my trip. \n\nI went home and called The Secretary of State help line, and every time someone told me no, I politely asked to be escalated to a higher up. Finally I reached somebody who had the sense to ask me to send them a photo or fax of my ID, and they said that not only could they use that, they could give me a bona fide driver’s license with it. I was ecstatic. I don’t drive but if I ever need to, I’m set now. She gives me a ref number and a phone number to give to the clerks if they try to pull the same thing again. \n\nI gather all my documents the next day and go back to the DMV. I wait for what seems like hours and FINALLY go up to try and get an enhanced license. Everybody I had spoken to the day before gave me dirty looks, but I presented all my documents and once again the question comes up of if it’s an actual ID or not. The clerk chastises me about wasting time when there’s so many people in line, and I whip out the reference number. The supervisor comes over and explains to her clerk that I had pitched a fit all the way to Lansing (the capitol) and they needed to give me the license. \n\nThey pussyfoot around for a few hours, making calls trying to find some sort of contradiction, and wasting time when finally I’m called to take my picture. The supervisor is visibly LIVID and the clerk is way frustrated. The woman who checked my documents the day before is watching in absolute disbelief. I grinned for my photo, and took my temporary ID with a smile and thanked everyone for being SO HELPFUL. \n\nTL;DR; DMV wastes my time and makes me cry, I make some calls and kill them with kindness. \n\nEDIT/UPDATE: Toronto was lovely and, ironically enough, it was getting back into the US that they didn’t want to let me back across the border lmfao.",

        "text": "Honestly not looking for attention or traction on this, kinda just want to vent about it. \n\nI worked for a luxury makeup line under a department store similar to Dillard’s.  There were 3 of these chains in my area, but I worked at the largest store (3rd largest in the company) in the richest area of the metropolitan.  \n\nThe shit I dealt with. \n\nNot only were the customers god awful, management was an absolute train wreck.  They paid me under starting wage for 10 months, and every time I’d bring it up, they’d encourage me to make up the difference with commission (3%) and the store card incentive ($2 for every card opened).  The makeup company I worked for was great.  But the store itself was terrible.  Constant clopening, holiday hours were from 7 am to midnight, including Thanksgiving/Black Friday in which it was mandatory that all employees work 18 hours in 2 days with only an 8 hour break in between, refused to close during life-threatening blizzards and counted those call-ins against you, and they would ride your ass over the smallest things.  There are many more that still piss me off to this day, but thats another story.  \n\nRight before the holidays, I learned that this guy who harassed and stalked both me and my best friend throughout high school would be coming back to work there.  I knew he worked there before, but he moved out of state for college months before I started so I figured it’d be fine.  Turns out he decided to drop out and move back.  When I heard about this, I sat down with my managers and told them everything— he threatened her many times and me (vaguely) a few times too.  He was also racist.  They said this raised a few red flags and they most likely weren’t going to hire him back.  Come a few weeks out, guess who’s training in a manager position! \n\nI was irate.  I put up with a lot of bullshit before that, then I started to catch onto the little things.  For one example, my managers would be shitty with me if I wasn’t “dressed well enough” although on the salary they were paying me as a young adult on my own I had absolutely no money for designer clothes like they were insinuating.  My boss recommended Calvin Klein to me. I made nine-fucking-fifty.  I promised myself I’d stick it out through the holidays and then through the spring since those are the two best seasons for commission.  \n\nFinally in April after the biggest storewide event ended I applied somewhere else (still working there, absolutely love it).  It was $4 more per hour and I wouldn’t do nearly as much work.  After I got the job I immediately went to work to hand in my two weeks notice and had never felt more relieved in my life.  About a week into it the store had announced all the chains were closing and we’d be out of a job by August.  The customers were even worse than normal.  Yelling and throwing full on adult fits to employees who just learned they need to find a new job.  The company sent out notices the day after the announcement to customers to use up their merch and gift cards because we cannot guarantee they’ll be able to use them past a 2 or 3 day span.  They scheduled me my last 6 days in a row.  I showed up to one of them after the announcement had been made and by the end of a 5 hour shift I was completely beat down.  The next day I called an hour before my shift and told them I’m done.  One of my favorite coworkers called me and asked if I was okay, because management had called her and asked her to work more and come in early because “they had been hit pretty hard,” then she quit and moved across the country not too long after. \n\nTLDR: Fuck department stores, fuck commission jobs, you treat me like shit for months and act like i’m replaceable, and ill wait until you can’t replace me anymore.  They’re closing for good in 6 days and i’m just glad no one has to be subjected to donate their life to a company who gives NO shits about their employees.  ",

        "text": "A few years ago, my mother and I went to the cinema to see *Snabba cash*, a swedish film, as part of the Scandinavian Film Festival. \nWe were eyeing which rows to pick when she decided to go back to the bar to buy a glass of wine for the movie, and I went on ahead to find choice seats (first come, first serve basis). \n\nEveryone was pretty spread out in the theatre but there was a fairly empty row in the middle back. Perfect. I made my way there and asked a greying man, who was sitting just off-centre, if anyone was sitting next to him (I was planning to keep a seat empty between us, but would leave more seats between us if he was saving a seat for someone who was perhaps at the candy bar, like my mum was). Just a courtesy.\n\nHis response was quite strange. Strained and sickly sweet with condescension,\n\n\"In Australia, we like to sit with space between us,\" he motioned around the room, patrons dotted here and there.\n\nBecause of his tone, I initially thought he was joking in an awkward way. \"Haha yeah, I am Australian, I love getting in early for a good seat,\" I said genially, sitting down with one seat between us.\n\nHe more or less repeated himself but growled more insistently with a hostile, toothy smile. I was taken aback. \"Huh? I was born here. I just wanted to know if you were saving a seat so I could leave more space. Why are you being rude?\"\n\nWell, this then quickly escalated to his angry words I don't remember precisely, punctuated with \"Go back where you came from.\" Classic.\n\nI've only rarely experienced overt racism before and I felt light-headed with this unexpected confrontation. I responded, \"Where would I go? Unless you're Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander, *everyone* in Australia came from an immigrant family at some point over the past 200-odd years. You're as much an immigrant as I am\". My point being, nearly everyone is from somewhere else, you meanie, and also don't be mean.\n\nHe flapped his hand dismissively, cutting me off.\n\nAt this point, a couple of other greying cinema goers were telling him to leave the theatre, or asked sarcastically if meanie was having a bad day. \n\nHe remained steadfastly his seat and simmered down. \n\nA few minutes passed and my mum arrived with sauv blanc in hand, completely unaware of what had transpired. The theatre was much more populated now, our row two thirds full. I patted the seat between the mean man and I. \"Hi mum! Come sit here,\" I said cheerfully. She did without question and we had some light banter before the adverts and film came on. He sat rather woodenly. No companion came to join him after all.\n\nThe revenge is that he had to sit next to my mum instead of an empty seat :) \n\nThe reason mum and I were interested in the film festival was because of learning more about our ancestry, and I'd started attending language classes. Our diverse family line has roots and branches in various non-englishy countries but has been in Australia for 6 generations. I am half Nigerian but my mum looks pale Scandinavian. I hope that gave him some pause.\n\nTL;DR: No apologies for length, it's been something that I only brought up the once on the drive home.\n\nIt just puzzles me that someone like him, caught up over seating, would attend an event that exists to celebrate and showcase art from different cultures.

        "text": "So about 2 years ago I work for a Tech company in Tech Support.  Most of the people are pretty cool, but the guy I work closest with (lets call him P) is a total asshole.   The kind of guy who will look you in the eye when you're asking him for help and then just look back at his screen like you don't even exist.  \n\nMe and P never really got on from the get go, he had been with the company a long time (15 years+) and I came along and he resented me from the start. He's good buddies (and neighbours) with our manager, so I could never really say much in my own defense in the early days. I think it was also down to the fact I didn't have any real experience at the time and he just wasn't the kind of person that was used to having to help people, either way he treated me like shit all day every day.\n\nAnyway, fast forward 18 months into this job and it's March 2017.  In March every year there is a big horse racing event in a town near to where I work, and P, being a big gambler and actually working a second job at the race course, wants to take some time  off the same 3 days as he does every year to go to this event.\nHe usually does this only a month or so in advance, couldn't tell you why.  \n\nRight around the time I knew he would be wanting to book this time off, P decides to take his shithousery up a notch and calls me out in front of the whole team for texting my girlfriend when im in work.  The day before, he spent almost 2 hours watching horseracing on his phone.  Needless to say, I told him to go fuck himself and called him out on his crap.\n\nLater that day I checked the holiday rota and realised P hadn't actually booked off his annual horserace event.  You can bet your ass I took the opportunity to take those days for myself, and as we weren't both allowed to take leave at the same time, he had to work those days while I sat around my house for 3 days eating, drinking and playing video games.  I made sure everyone knew that's why I did it too.",

I'm more than used to standing so I just grab a hanging handle and zone out on my phone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 3 stops later, this older lady gets on and stands next to me. This train usually gets pretty packed (almost sardine packed) during commute times so standing shoulder to shoulder and bumping to the person next to you happens quite a bit. There were quite a few handles free as many of the passengers held a seat handle or leaning against the side. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't think much of anything until I felt someone grab my hand. Looking up, I noticed that it was the lady, she was stretching over to grab onto the handle I was already holding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just said \"Excuse me ma'am, there's a free handle right above you. It'd be easier for you to grab.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe kind of just looked up at the handle, shrugged and ignored me. She kept grabbing many handle, letting go to make a move on her phone for Candy Crush, and then grabbing my hand. I'm not letting go of my handle as I have terrible balance on a moving train. Definitely got awkward really quick. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemembering some stories that I have read on petty revenge, a slightly evil-licious idea hatched. I didn't want a scene or trouble, just wanted her to stop touching me and grab the free handle above her own head (instead of reaching over for mine). There were people behind and in front of us so I couldn't scoot away. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stayed quiet for a bit , browsed my phone and waited till it was almost to the stop I get off at. Suddenly looked up acting shocked, I whispered loudly just enough for her to hear\"\n\n\"Oh god, ew gross\" and let go of the handle really quick like I noticed something disgusting on it. \n\nI pulled my hand sanitizer out of my pocket and rubbed my hands vigorously with it. I always have it in my pocket since the trains are know to be fairly gross.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was freaked out because she thought she also touched something gross and looked around for a napkin or something. Just as she turned to me saying \"Sorry, can I get some hand sanitizer from you?\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I made my way over to the opening doors, I said \"No, sorry! This is my stop!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I also had been going to school to better my career, the company knew this and worked with me if scheduling needed to be changed.

So one day, a friend of mine who used to work there, has mentioned she would like to work there again, and i thought, \"hey, maybe during my last 6 months while you are a driver, and can sort of train you on how my position works, and when i do end up finding another job, it would probably be a sure thing you would get my position.\" Lets call my dumbass manager DB, friend F, and me, as CopperKlicks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCopperKlicks: \"hey DB, before you had started working here, F used to work here, and she kind of helped me out with dispatching if need be, if you are short drivers, we should consider hiring her.\"\n\nDB: \"thats a good idea actually, tell her to come in and fill out an application\"\n\nCopperKlicks: \" well she doesn't own a car at the moment, but tomorrow morning before i come into work, i can pick her up and bring her here\"\n\nDB: yea why don't you do that.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo next day, i am happily picking up my friend as it would be great to work with someone i actually like again, we worked really well together, she is a hard worker. She fills out her application, done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1 week goes by and DM wants to have a talk with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDM: \"so we( he spoke as if this was a corporate decision, its him and him) thought about this and we want her to come aboard and for you to teach her how to dispatch since she will be dispatching next week.\"\n\nCopperKlicks: \"oh really?, i didnt know we were allowed to have two dispatchers, is she like my assistant or something?\n\nDM: \"no, see, she is going to be the dispatcher. I kind have put some thought into this, and i think you make too much money being a dispatcher, and i want to hire a cheaper dispatcher. Also you are almost done with school so its not like you were going to be staying here much longer, lets be honest. So i'm going to be demoting you to part-time driver, with that pay, and from time to time, teach F what she needs to do.\"\n\n(YES, DM did say exactly that, i make too much, and im almost done with school so who cares)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was beyond livid, i wanted to tell him all the places he could fuck off, but, at the same time, i have a kid, and rent, and other bills, i couldn't just quit right there. So, i swallowed my pride, and sadly accepted the offer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring my last two weeks of dispatching before F got hired, i desperately went EVERYWHERE to find a dispatching position, but could not find one, however, after a couple interviews , i was able to land a job with a well known auto store with some red shirts, it was slightly less then what i made, but i got to keep my pride.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 1 of F starting out, 15 minutes before i was to clock in, i called the dispatch line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nF: \"dispatch\"\n\nCopperKlicks: \"hello F, how is the dispatching going?\"\n\nF: oh hey CopperKlicks, good good, its a little crazy, this system is slightly different, DM is kind of showing me some stuff, but he said you will show me the system a little better.\"\n\nCopperKlicks: \"yea yea, anyways, i want to say i really think you will do great dispatching, it's not incredibly hard, and you did help me out so you sorta know the ins and outs. But anyways, do me a favor and tell DM that i fucking quit.\"\n\nF: \"I... um... ok.... i'll let him know\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really wished i had done it to him in person, just walk in, not punch in, and tell him fucking see ya, but i asked what he said and i guess he had a stupid shock look on his face and bad named me on how i could do this too him. That part, did feel good\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
