        "text": "Tales of Lucky Dice a Savage Worlds Compilation\n\nTale #1: He used to have a mech.\nSci-fi game with a friend running who hadn’t really run anything before. Pregen characters. For this tale we will only need to know about one.\nMurder-bot (MB): While not originally intended to be is effectively HK-47, slightly less sarcastic. Armed with sniper rifle. \nLooting “abandoned” space station, find out it is filled with soldiers in cryo sleep. Fail to be sneaky. Run and gun. Get to final fight. Lots of little robots, several soldiers, and the captain is in a mech.\nInitiative cards are dealt MB gets highest card. “I shoot the mech”. Rolls damage causes one wound. DM must now roll on the critical hits table. He rolls 2d6 and gets 12. Vehicle is Wrecked and no longer will function it also may start exploding if it is that kind of vehicle. First attack of the round and the boss is down now it is just time to do a little clean up. \n\nTale #2: I only need one shot\nCyberpunk game group is playing a team that is supposed to stop a rival corporation’s weapon demonstration. Was playing as a sniper only other character to make it out okay was my spotter.\nLost one character to gang war that was entirely unrelated to the mission. Infiltration of opposing corporation’s facilities went poorly. 2 players were found out and had to fight their way in and out. My spotter and her bodyguard forgot they weren’t actually there to make a deal and got taken out to a bar. Sniper who went solo was only successful infiltrator. I had only infiltrated the demonstration site. So day of test we have to ruin the demonstration. Bodyguard and melee man are going to try and shut down the power, fail. Sniper and spotter get into position to cover everyone else. Street samurai drives gas truck towards armored bunker, gets shot at, crashes, and unleashes the weapons. Man sized killer Gummy Bears spill out of container and start eating him.\nWe have one last shot. The helicopter is coming in to drop off the military observers. Why not let’s shoot at their helicopter. Extreme range lot of negatives on the shot. It hits. 3 wounds to the helicopter. Shot destroys all of the helicopters steering and it is flying into a major city.\n\nTale #3: Hey want a job\nMass effect pseudo campaign. Kor the Wonder Krogan.\nKor’s merry band of mercenaries took on Cerberus without him. Cerberus took one of the crew captive. This will not stand attack on Cerberus is in progress. Follow ship that took crew member. Took over the ship. Take shuttle down to the planet to a secret Cerberus base. Firefight starts when Krogan jumps from moving shuttle. Every Cerberus member on the platform dies Kor and his mercenaries are unscathed.\nInside base get pinned between Cerberus troops and engineers with deployable turrets. Kor biotic charges the engineer who is visible. As he appears in a flash of light, blood, and scrap metal he asks the engineers “So do you want a job”. Persuasion role time. 36 after negatives, only needed a 4. They are instantly loyal. Kor has more crew now.\n\nTale #4: You blew up my balls\n2 separate occasions. One cyberpunk and one supers game. \nCyberpunk: Playing large augmented melee man. Infiltration went poorly. Swat is attacking us. They are coming through the security doo we are using as a choke point. Teammate thinks “you know I know most of my team is in melee right now but I haven’t used this grenade launcher”. She fired a grenade launcher into melee. I took a wound. Because of a setting rule you can receive a permanent injury when you take a wound. I roll the 2d6 on the injury table and get a 2. This is the unmentionable entry which means that my character can never breed again.\nSupers: Attacking crime den. Lucky for me I can regenerate because I guy on the roof decides to pull out a rocket launcher and shoots me. Another injury roll later and my balls got blown up again.\nSide note: Ever since the cyberpunk game if my character takes an injury it always seems to be to the balls. \n\n",

        "text": "The following story takes place in a home brew session that was played extremely fast and easy. If it was plausible and/or entertaining, it slid. \n\nThe story was basically that we had fallen into some random dimensional hole and ended up in fantasy world #4396. The characters involved consisted of an antisocial rogue, an even more antisocial archer, and a mage played by yours truly. It's probably also worth mentioning that my mage was the best melee fighter of the group (it's slightly less pathetic than it sounds) and the main perpetrator of this story.\n\nSo we're all chilling in the main city after a rather unpleasant tromp through some cursed woods. The others were doing their bow and sneaks stuff while I picked up some new spells. One of them was a flight spell that I promptly used to levitate a few inches above the ground and slowly do flips until the guards told me  to stop because I was making everyone super jealous. Suddenly, a letter falls from the sky into our hands. Someone calling himself the Phoenix King had a job for us to raid some weird cyclops cult and retrieve a phoenix that they had imprisoned. Since we had nothing better to do, we accepted the strange quest from some dude we never met before and went to do what we did best, indiscriminate murder in the name of great justice and profit.\n\nSo we rock up to the cyclops cult and introduce ourselves with a hail of exploding arrows and arcane fire. Rogue is doing his stealth thing, archer is doing his archer thing and I'm doing a combination of chucking wheels of  burning death and cutting people in half with energy waves from my sword that also destroys the soul of the victim. Some might have called us overpowered but those people don't have soul destroying swords or arrows that can melt your face off from a mile away. We kick down the door of where the phoenix is being held and turn the guards into chunky salsa. The excitement of the battle seems to get to the phoenix as it suffers what seemed to be a spontaneous heart attack and burnt to ash instantly. We weren't worried as we knew how phoenixes worked and waited until it would rise again.\n\n10 minutes passed.\n\n20 minutes passed.\n\nWe figured that it was just really tired and needed some more time.\n\n30 minutes passed.\n\nWe thought maybe it was shy about the whole process in front of others and we should just take the ashes and bring them to the client. As we were leaving, we were suddenly jumped by a few dozen cultists who had magical countermeasures like crazy because the GM was getting a little sick of our shenanigans. Pressed for time and options, I decided that we needed this phoenix on our side right now and decided, in my infinite wisdom, to cast a dark resurrection spell on the ashes. Things went downhill very quickly.\n\nIn a gout of black flame, a dark phoenix rose from the ashes and incinerated everyone nearby, the party included. Fortunately, we had received one \"get out of fuck up free\" card from an earlier quest and revived a few seconds later as the dark phoenix took off towards the nearest town. The Phoenix King, who turned out to actually be the king of phoenixes and not just some dude who wanted a cool name like we had expected, ported in originally to thank us for a job well done but was now here to tell us what a bunch of morons we were. Since we screwed up, we had to make things right before the whole country got glassed. Our plan was for Super Archer to peg the thing in the wings while it flew by and then me and the rogue would slam it with everything we had until it was weak enough for Phoenix King to hold down and purify its soul of my dark magic. This plan actually worked out pretty well aside from a few burnt villages as collateral damage and the rogue eating black fire and burning to a crisp. Since my resurrection spell had already done enough for one day, we put his ashes in a bottle next to the archer's collection of zombie parts and spider venom (he was weird like that) to give to a priest in town for a proper revival. The Phoenix King took the newly uncorrupted phoenix, tossed us a sack of money and magic stuff, told us the he was never going to ask for our help ever again and peaced out.\n\nI have no idea what the moral of this story is. Think before you act? Don't use dark revival magic on a symbol of eternal life? Awesome mages be awesome? Doesn't really matter. Point is, it was a silly adventure and we all had fun. ",

        "text": "So, this happened in my group's pathfinder session last night. We were fighting a group of demons who ambushed me (slayer) while I was hunting near our camp for food for the night. The thing about slayers is, they have a pretty poor will save, especially when wisdom is somewhat of a dump stat. So, when one of these demons popped me with confusion, I was somewhat confused. Anyway, it gets to my round and whadayaknow, I roll a 13 on my confusion roll, I get to act normally, my next round I was less lucky, I decided that in my mind addled state, that I would drop my weapon, draw a random item from my handy haversack and bop myself on the noggin with it (Decanter of everflowing water). Ouch. Anywho, by this time my party have emerged from our camp and come to investigate, one of them just happens to be in position for flanking with my now mildly insane slayer, some damage is done to the other demons and now back to my turn. Confusion roll, 21-act normally. I'm standing here with a Decanter of everflowing water in one hand, a kukri in the other, and a flanking buddy. Cue full round of attacks with as an improvised weapon, here's where it gets awesome, I'm flanking, sneak damage ensues, I expertly and precisely cave in the head of a demon with a jug, everyone laughs.

        "text": "I'm playing Silhastas Starwhisper, a noble high elf assassin, for Adventurers' League right now, and the character is generally polite, charming, and easy-going. It was the first session, everyone was meshing well, and Silhastas seemed to be accepting and kind-hearted, if a killer shot with a longbow. She bought a wagon and draft horse for the other characters while she rode her fine steed, and payed a local half-orc handsomely to watch her mount overnight. She treated everyone in town with respect, and even paid for drinks!\n\nThen we go out and find a dungeon, and capture the necromancer who dwelled within. He'd been killing people and reanimating their bodies. We questioned him about any connections he might have, and he wasn't talking - or, at least, wasn't saying anything useful, just babbling about how he was a powerful necromancer and how the Elder Eye will kill as all or some tripe. So I say to the DM, \"I [as Silhastas] stand up and I approach the necromancer, and I gentley take his hand in mine.  Then I drive my knife through his hand into the table.\"\n\nEveryone suddenly got really quiet. I leaned over towards the DM and we have this exchange:\n\n\"Do you know who I am?\"\n\n\"N-no...\"\n\n\"I am a scion of the Galastacia, the Starwhisper family. They call us 'sthel-kalin' - the elvish word for 'nightmares'. The name's not entirely accurate - you see, we're more like the ones the Lord's Alliance pays to kill nightmares. My eldest brother is particularly terrifying. I once had the pleasure of watching him work, when he killed thirty men in a bar... with an ink-pen. A gods-damned *ink-pen*.\n\n\"At one point, my father was working with a client who was rather particular about the methods used for the commission. I quote: 'The Duchess must die through strangulation, smothering, or any way you can devise to cease her breathing'.\n\n\"So my father killed her by surgically removing her lungs as she slept.\n\n\"Now, here you have a very crucial choice. You can answer our questions and provide us with useful information, or I will cut out your lungs, right here, right now, with you awake and screaming on this table. My father can do that with his eyes closed, but I have not yet received the necessary training. It will be messy. And it is entirely your choice.\"\n\nAnd after that, you could have heard a pin drop in the room. The necromancer talked, no check required. Everyone is slightly more wary of my character now. Lawful Evil alignments are the best.\n\n(As a side note, I don't usually play characters that do awful things on a regular basis, and my group knows that and they know me. I would NOT recommend playing a character like this the first time you play with a group.)",

        "text": "Here's the second installment in my Warhammer Fantasy campaign write up. First, a quick refresher on the story. They're all part of a trade caravan traveling through the Border Princes, a series of small human kingdoms and city-states, with the ultimate goal of heading to Araby, which is the setting's Arabian Nights expy. I noticed that the last story was pretty light on explaining setting details, so I'm gonna try and put some setting stuff and meta-commentary on this one. And before I forget, here's the cast(more detail can be found in Part 1):\n\nVebur Skullhammer, Dwarf Troll Slayer\n\nSwearing the slayer oath to die in battle after breaking the dwarven code of honor, Vebur is with the caravan following the path of his ancestor, who traveled to Araby centuries ago. And he might find some terrible monster to slay him along the way - unfortunately for him, dwarves are psychologically incapable of fighting to lose.\n\nAxel Muffins, Halfling Fieldwarden\n\nAxel was formerly part of a tight-knit group of scouts in the halfling homeland. His group was nearly destroyed by an encounter with the necromancer Dramesh. Axel, the only survivor, joined the caravan in search of new beginnings.\n\nRigg D'Elvagar, Human Tradesman\n\nRigg is a middle-aged man who grew up in a small village in the northern human Empire. Realizing he had reached his life's halfway point with nothing to show for it, Rigg apprenticed to an engineer by the name of Gregor Friemann, the caravan's resident technical expert.\n\nHelden Rommstagg, Human Apprentice Wizard\n\nHelden is a wizard who channels one of the eight winds of magic. His wind of choice is Shyish, the wind of death. As the senior apprentice of the Amethyst College, he was sent to investigate the disappearance of another Amethyst Magister by the name of Ludevicus, who vanished hunting down Dramesh.\n\nNikkel Roklept, Human Grave Robber\n\nBorn a peasant in the Empire, Nikkel's life was changed forever when his father abandoned the Roklept family, leaving behind a chest containing a stack of encrypted maps and a decoding tool, encoded in an unknown language. Nikkel was able to figure out that his father had headed in the direction of Araby, and joined the caravan to pursue the mystery.\n\n**Adventure 2: Secrets Beneath the Stone City**\n\nSeveral relatively uneventful days passed after the exploits in Greenarrow. The party got to know the other dramatis personae in the caravan while they traveled to the next location, a trading city called Pentus. Axel got to know Anastasia, the former Kislevite mercenary turned cook, and they helped cook meals for the caravan. In return for his help, Anastasia promised Axel her old suit of mail to repurpose for his own needs and smaller stature. Vebur shared several drunken conversations with the lunatic jester, Julius Quak from the trading city of Marienburg. Julius and his dog, Ronald, had been exiled from Marienburg for reasons unknown and now traveled with the caravan. Rigg worked with Gregor Friemann, who continued to teach Rigg the ways of engineering. Gregor promised Rigg he would help him look for gun parts in Pentus. Rigg also used some casks owned by Ronald Ultrecht(not the dog) of the Wissenberg Trade Fraternity to start brewing. Helden, for the most part, kept to himself. Nikkel began speaking to Hadir al’Firq, a priest of Araby’s One True God traveling with the caravan. Hadir took quite an interest in Nikkel’s encrypted maps and the strange tool used to decipher them. He was able to tell Nikkel that the mysterious language was the dead tongue of the Mourkain Empire, but unfortunately hardly anyone alive today spoke it.\n\nThe group arrived at Pentus, a sprawling city on the edge of a cliff built almost entirely out of stone. Pentus, situated on the main overland trade route between the Empire and the Dwarven seaport of Barak Varr, was a nexus of trade. It used the Lift, an ancient piece of Arabyan technology, essentially a huge stone elevator, to facilitate the transport of wagons and the like over the cliff face. However, Pentus had a problem. A belligerent, stinking,green problem. An Orc Waaagh! had slaughtered and pillaged its way out of the Badlands, stopping at the cliffs below Pentus with no way of getting up. There they stayed, hoping to starve the stone city out. They had been there for several weeks and would likely stay for another one or two before they got bored. Fortunately, the Orcs were too stupid to realize that a city like Pentus necessitated stores of food that would last longer than greenskin attention spans.\n\n*I love the Warhammer orcs. Cockney monsters with an addiction to violence, who group up in a Waaagh! - one part holy crusade, one part roving band of hooligans, one part force of nature. A GM's best friend for keeping their party in one place, hehehe.*\n\nWith the expedition's southward progress halted for the time being, the party opted to explore the city. Vebur entertained himself harassing the orcs below the cliff before the party opted to watch one of the gladiatorial games in the arena. They were suitably impressed by the martial skill of Liana Savelli, Pentus' martial champion. Helden, however, saw something else. The energies of blood and Chaos shrouded her and her witch-blade, and he impulsively reached out with magic to sabotage her bout. He was stopped by a swift counterspell delivered by Erica Jung, a scholar with the expedition. After the game, Helden and the revealed magistra of Hysh had a heated discussion. She claimed superior rank and implored him not to strike at Chaos before scoping out the extent of the threat. He tentatively agreed.\n\n*Helden has a bit more of a gung-ho attitude than most wizards, especially Erica. Not too gung-ho to hide his magic, though. Outside of the Empire, he and Erica have no protection from overzealous commoners likely to hang them for witchcraft.*\n\nMeanwhile, Nikkel opted to scope out the graveyard with the intention of assessing where best to gather income. There, he encountered a man of tremendous stature, cloaked entirely in black. After a brief conversation, and a glance at the cypher around his neck, the Black-Cloaked Man appeared to realize who Nikkel was, calling him by his full name. He cryptically reassured Nikkel that they would meet again soon before departing. Returning from the graveyard, Nikkel cut through the Strigany shantytown outside the city, where he was waylaid by a gang of thugs and kidnapped. The leader of the Strigany attempted to take his father's maps, but Nikkel was able to snatch them back and escape the shanty. \n\n*The Strigany are Warhammer's version of Romani/\"gypsies\". They are also the descendants of the Mourkain Empire*\n\nHelden, returning to the caravan, was overcome by a vision delivered through his witchsight; a point of light buried in the cliff that shined black and spread its roots up to the city above. The fading afterimage of the vision led Helden to a ruined stone tower in the graveyard. One of five Arabyan - built towers, this one had partially crumbled long ago, inhabited solely by an aging groundskeeper who showed Helden the way under Pentus. Traveling deep into the catacombs carved through the cliff, Helden followed the tendrils of dark magic before being ambushed by a foul, slavering creature - a ghoul. The ghoul rapidly overpowered the apprentice, imparting several vicious slashes before the apprentice unleashed a wild burst of light, scaring off the nocturnal creature. Helden, badly wounded, dragged his bleeding form out of the catacombs before the ghoul could return with the rest of its pack.\n\n*Witchsight is another handy GM tool in Warhammer, the ability of magic users to see the winds of magic around them. It isn't an exact science, coming in the form of strange omens and vague impressions that don't correlate with the reality of the senses. Also, first Fate Point down in the second session, which is basically an extra life.* \n\nReconvening at the expedition camp outside the walls of Pentus, the party discussed the day's findings. Agreeing that there was something bizarre going on, likely associated with the chaos cult encountered in Greenarrow, the party fortified their tentative alliance and resolved to investigate further. The next day, they gathered at what Helden identified as the point he sensed the most dark magic-the mines below the city. They encountered the leader of the Pentus Mining Guild, Jurgen Halstred, and while initially wary he revealed to the party his finding-a massive chunk of warpstone, having fallen from the sky and bored through the cliff many ages ago. He also imparted his suspicions that the other members of Pentus' ruling elite, particularly the regent Francis Petronus, were chaos worshipers. \n\nTurning to scholarly resources, the party determined that the warpstone deposit was directly below one of Pentus' five Arabyan towers, built to contain some sort of dark energy with charms carved into the stone. This malevolent influence had been responsible for the fall of Pentus while it was under Remean (*Warhammer Rome*) rule, and then again when it was an independent city. Only the coming of the Arabyans halted the pattern. The Gatekeeper's tower, over the warpstone, had been badly damaged by a freak lightning strike decades ago, and the disrupted bindings were failing to hold back the warpstone's corrupting influence. Helden and Erica deduced that there was not one, but five warpstone lodes inside the cliff tunnels, and the patterns of magic woven through the air seemed to suggest they were to be used to power a ritual, and soon.\n\nBefore they continued their investigation, Vebur, unwillingly followed by Axel, set off into the small Dwarven area of the city to investigate the path of his ancestor Verrick. While the dwarves did have records of Verrick's coming through Pentus, they were unfortunately scarce on further information, having suffered great damage during a fire years ago. With heavy hearts, the dwarves of Pentus informed Vebur and Axel that the elves of the city had undamaged records, and could perhaps help them more, assuming there was no elven treachery. Venturing to the halls of the elven merchant family local to Pentus, the dwarf and the halfling narrowly avoided being turned away at the door, as the leader of the clan was apparently expecting them. He informed Axel that he and Helden should seek an oracle living outside the city, who had come from far Araby.  Regretfully, he had little more info to give Vebur, as his ancestor loathed elves even more than he, and had kept his lips tight shut. However, the elves had their own writings associating a \"forge of the gods\" with the city of Bel-Aliad, coincidentally-or perhaps not-located deep in the Arabyan desert.  \n\nAxel, fueled by curiosity, gathered Helden and set out into the woods north of Pentus, guided by a peculiar charm given to him by the elves. They stumbled upon an overgrown ruin, and were greeted by the wizened elf oracle, who entered a prophetic trance. He spoke cryptically of the party overcoming great evil only through unity, of a reunion with the necromancer Dramesh that they both sought, and of their fates being interwoven with a great destiny stretching from the past and into the future. Reassured little by the elf's riddles, the two made their way back to Pentus.  \n\nNikkel opted to investigate whether or not the Regent was truly tainted by chaos, and stole into the central government complex disguised as a guard. He found the Regent's bedchambers empty, and set to opening a great oaken chest at the foot of the bed. He found it full of the trappings of dark sorcery, charms of crow feathers and a bound grimoire. However, the devious Regent had set a trap of sorts on the chest, and it set to an unearthly wailing that could be heard across the city. Nikkel fled unseen after putting the bedroom to the torch, but he had already unwittingly set the events of what would later be known as the Night of Damnation into motion. The Regent, the local head of the chaos cult of a minor dark god known as the Morrigan, planned to summon an aspect of her, and upon the chest being breached and the alarm being set, he rushed to begin the ritual. As he gathered the final components, the party regrouped outside the walls, Nikkel and Helden troubled by a sense of foreboding. Unknown to either side, Dramesh himself had come to Pentus that very night, and set about raising the hordes of dead interred in the cemetery.  \n\nThe expedition's camp was disrupted by a crack of thunder, and a swirling black tornado descending from the clouds overhead, its funnel bound for the center of the city. The party set out to stop whatever was creating the witch-storm, battling through hordes of undead and struggling through blood rising up through the cobbles of Pentus. Axel caught a glimpse of Dramesh invoking his necromantic magicks in the far distance, but the party persuaded him to face the threats to Pentus one at a time. The party made it to the center square moments too late, as the tornado touched down while the regent howled his triumph. The black winds dispersed to reveal an inhumanly tall figure, draped in a cloak of crow feathers that swirled and strived to be wings. The daemon raised its hand and chanted foul words in the Dark Tongue, and it dispersed into a cloud of feathers twisting into a vortex of malevolent energy- heading straight for Rigg. Axel moved to jump in the way of the daemon's spell, but Vebur held him back. Rigg, frozen in fear, was struck by the blast and thrown from his feet in a flurry of black feathers. His last sight before losing consciousness was a patch of the feathers burrowing point-first into his chest. \n\n",

Teams of adventurers would compete in this contest set up by a crazy wizard. \n\nMy Dwarf was named Throm, unfortunately I can't remember the other characters names, but there was a cowardly thief, a VERY evil cleric, a ranger, and a fey something I can't remember.\n\n Anyway,  the first event was a stone dungeon maze we had to navigate, made incredibly easy by my stone sense. In fact, the GM was not happy that we so easily breezed through the maze, the last trap ( indiana jones style dart wall) got me right in my junk, and cursed it off.  I accepted my fate, (1 insanity point) and our team moved on to the next challenge, kill a Vorpal Dragon.\n\nThe dragon started off in the air, so I tried to taunt it down by waving my bone in the air. Well I caught its attention,  and I failed a 10 up reflex check, and he used his once a day vorpal strike  to cut my head off... then eat my dick while my head watched  (1 insanity point).\n\nZap\n\nI'm transported to the lobby where the other teams are waiting their turn, watching our progress on enchanted mirrors.  In there I meet a monk, I try to chat with him, he whispers one word and I get knocked out for a turn, turns out this guy is like 300 years old, and has some wicked voice powers. \n\nmy team manages to kill the dragon, the stadium was enchanted to where the more they cheered the more powerful our attacks were. The dragon exploded and my dick lay there in the dirt, so I picked it up and cleaned it off... with my mouth (1 insanity point).\n\nThe monks team was up to fight the dragon, and it was over in 2 seconds, the monk said one word aloud and the dragon and the entire crowd died.\n\nSo we got a 1 day rest period while the wizard drummed up a new crowd, and added protective spells to his stadium. So I went to the only temple in town, a temple of Yolanda (halfling females) to get my dick un-cursed and healed back on.  \n\nWhile I laid in the bed recovering a priestess decided she liked the look of my vaguely off-color dick, and wanted it in her... being a male, I jumped at the chance to have imaginary sex with a halfling...\n\nAt the moment of climax my dick (which had just spent some time inside a Vorpal Dragon) instantly grew 3 feet long, shot through the halfling, and exploded her head. I had just learned of my new ability, once a day vorpal dick strike. I covered the unfortunate priestess with my blanket, snuck out of my room in the temple, hit up the head priestess for carriage money and went my merry way. (2 insanity points) \n\nThe third challenge was a fight between the only two teams to kill the dragon, mine and the 300 year old monks team. I told my team about the monk and we were able to get some beeswax to stuff in our ears before the match. \n\nThe fight was pretty touch and go there for a bit,  but we managed to kill everyone but the monk. I signaled to my team that \"this one's mine\" and I jumped in the air, matrix style,  and used my special ability, exploding the monks head with my vorpal dick. The prize was one \"wish\" spell scroll and 10,000 gold. I didn't use the wish spell to turn my dick back to normal.\n\nI should say that Throm started out Chaotic Good, (the rest of the party was evil) but because of all the insanity points I took for the fucked up things that happened to me, I was chaotic evil by the end of the night. \n\nBest session ever.",

        "text": "Disclaimer: I am a new DM, and this was only my third time running a game. Also, all of the players are 14 year old boys, hyped up on sugar. I was running the Lost Mine of Phandelver, like many beginners. \n\nOur story begins outside a little village. A dwarven cleric, a halfling rouge, and an elvish wizard are all recruited to deliver much needed goods to a local town. Traveling merrily along their way, they suddenly encounter two dead horses, black arrows stuck in their necks and hides.\n\nThe dwarf decides that he's hungry and wishes to carve the meat off of the horses. He succeeds, and manages to get a decent amount (see: 50 lbs) of horse meat fit for humanoid consumption. \n\nI, foolishly of course, expect things to get underway. However, the halfling and the dwarf began bickering over the horse meat, and a brawl occurred between the two of them.\n\nSeveral stab wounds and ignored goblin ambushes later, the party finally arrives at the small town in which the goods were to be delivered. However, upon finding out that small children reside in this town, the party decided to enjoy a nice post-horse dinner.\n\nCornering a small child in an alleyway, the dwarf uses all his might and pounds him to death with his hammer. Leaving little more than meat and bones, the party decided to re-arm themselves with rather unorthodox weapons. \n\nFully equipped with child femer clubs, the party leaves the alleyway and runs into a handful of town guards.\n\nThe Mage, fearing for his life and his new bone-staff, pushes the party back into the alley, all the while casting magic missiles at the guards.\n\nIt was at this time, I was sure the dice were loaded. Every single thing they wanted to do, they rolled successfully for it. I was astounded, but went along with it.\n\nAfter finishing off the last of the town guard and becoming the most fearsome 'monsters' in town, the dwarf suddenly becomes overwhelmed with prejudice, and vows to see that the town's temple is burned to the ground, \"for the glory of Satan.\"\n\nArriving at the temple, the halfling manages to subdue the town priest and they begin bickering again. They want to eat the priest's flesh.\n\nAt this point, I really wanted to end the story, so I through a plot twist in there as soon as they had a bad roll (finally).\n\nAttempting to both kill and cook the priest at the same time, the Mage attempts to magic missile him. Rolling low, he instead cooks and kills the dwarf. The mage, wrought with guilt (because killing those kids and the guards was okay, but not this), attempts to use black magic to summon who he believes can bring back their dwarfish companion. \n\nYes, he summons the lord of the underworld, Beelzebub himself. Making a deal, and offering roast priest and a freshly burned temple, the devil accepts. He brings the dwarf back to life, where the dwarf promptly kills everyone in the party, including himself. The devil laughs, and condemns them to the underworld for eternity.\n\nI got up and decided to not play with these guys ever again. I left out the parts where I tried to steer the story back to Phandelver, but I eventually just gave up after a while and let them do whatever the shit they wanted. It was...\n\nWell, it was certainly a game. Maybe one day I can play a serious one.",

        "text": "Pathfinder campaign. I play a Halfling Rogue who has recently started picking up levels in a homebrew class, Shadow Knife. This class eventually gets the ability to use shadows as a means of travelling short distances, but at the time I was only able to call my two chosen weapons (attuned) to my side at any time if I concentrated hard enough. My two weapons are a shortsword and a needle, because needles are cool and I like shooting poisons at people. That's pretty much all the motivation right there.\n\nOur party was sneaking into a village that was taken over by an invading army to gather intel, and after splitting up, I had found my way onto the roof of the town hall. I had tried and failed to pull the two people having a strategy meeting out with distractions so I could grab the map and note, so I decided on a different approach. Namely, to stab my needle into the roof to hold a rope in place while I climb down the chimney and surprise them (it's a really good needle). DM has me make an attack check on the roof.\n\nNatural 20.\n\nDM tells me to confirm.\n\nNatural 20.\n\nThe way the DM does it, this means I've rolled something more powerful than your average critical. One more time?\n\nNatural 20.\n\nOkay, this doesn't exactly happen often - no one in the party had ever seen a triple critical before, and the group uses that setup for confirming crits pretty often.\n\nAnd I had just used it on a building.\n\nDM take a few minutes to decide what he wants to happen here. Eventually, he decides that he's going to take some liberties with the Shadow Knife class - As I stab into the roof, I become so attuned with my weapon that I become one with my weapon and end up accidentally using it as sort of a transmitter, and I phase right through the roof and start falling 30 feet, without making a hole larger than my needle.\n\nWell, my character is surprised, but he has a general idea of what happened and why it did, so I tuck and roll as I hit the ground. I land with a thump, but manage to scurry under a pew before anyone turns their head to see me. When they come to investigate the sound, I dash out, grab the map and the note, take some spears of ice to the chest for my efforts, crash out of a window and book it to the meeting spot, where I'm teleported out by the current quest's contractor.\n\nAnd that's the story of how I unlocked a new power by hitting a roof *really* well.",

        "text": "Something that I find vital to portraying a good story is looking at your characters as *characters*. This sounds like common knowledge, but it's very easy to look at the numbers on their sheet and simply quantify their worth or challenge, and a lot of newer GMs (myself included, 3+ years back) fall into the trap of just making their challengers bigger and stronger and faster than the players. It's also extremely important that if they do something, there are *always* consequences. You make sure not to have murderhobos by letting them know that they *will* be thrown in jail, for instance. This is a good example for both points that I didn't see coming at all, and I'm incredibly impressed with everyone involved.\n\n**Characters**\n\nRoborn: A woodsman who worships the goddess of nature, his martial skills were honed to a fine point before his temple was destroyed in a raid five years ago and he gained powers from his deity. Though he is one of the party's best combatants, he is pacifistic by nature, never wanting to engage if he can avoid it, and is loyal to a fault. When around fires, he starts experiencing flashbacks to his his burning home and cannot stand to be around anything larger than a small campfire or torch for that reason.\n\nLore: An ex-mercenary that is indebted to Roborn due to a scuffle a month or so back. Another fighter, he uses what remains of his father's scythe (the weapon was broken in a fight with trolls some weeks ago) to dispatch his enemies. He's large and faster than a man his size ought to be, but tends to have horrible luck. Between this and his (admittedly less-than-stellar) flute, his relationship with the party is being designated as the butt-monkey. In good nature, of course.\n\nGota: A priest of the god of the earth, Gota is a steadfast and lighthearted dwarf, chosen by his god to wield earthen energies and to bear a set of magical gauntlets that can make even the weakest man more than a match for much larger creatures. He can be a little bit clumsy, but is a mortifying opponent if he has to bring his hands to bare, pummeling men into submission with or without the gauntlets. He is deathly afraid of larger bodies of water as his brother perished when their mine sprung a leak and quickly flooded, and has the false notion that all metals belong to the earth and must return to it. Including, among other things, weapons. And gold.\n\nDrystan: The heir to a fallen kingdom, this prince is struggling to rebuild his lands after they were invaded by an unknown enemy, with his wife-to-be having been taken from him. He is handsome and charismatic, with an odd sense that let's him know when danger is near, but as a master of words he is able to empower his fellow teammates to fight harder, giving them tactical advice and support in battle. While not a fighter himself, the man can never let a soul suffer and is willing to do *anything* to make things right for even those he doesn't know. In working to rebuild his kingdom, he jumped to kick-start the commerce by gaining a ship and a crew. After a little bit of talking, I ruled that he could build some of the characters himself, and one of the characters he built was a kid that stowed away on the ship, but when they found him, he was given the option of joining the crew over being reprimanded and tossed back to shore, and obviously he took the offer. Specifically built to be very overconfident and insubordinate.\n\nDue to several technical and scheduling issues, this was the first pair of sessions we were able to have in months. We decided for a timeskip, where Drystan would meet back up with the other members of the party at a port city that was being blockaded by pirates for a few weeks. Drystan sailed in, paying the *large* extortion the pirates forced upon him, but the other members—Lore, Gota, and Roborn—refused to pay on the path into the town and decided to wipe this patrol off the map (these pirates were dressed and posing as town guards). After quickly dispatching them and entering the town *without hiding the bodies*, they found Drystan and sought out the town's mayor to try and understand what exactly was going on.\n\nAs they discussed things (they mayor being infuriated and scared for his people at the news of the dead pirates), the pirate captain, Barger, strolled into the street outside the town hall. The heroes looked on as he yelled that he had just found the bodies of his men and wouldn't tolerate this kind of thing, then had a child dragged out in front of him and pulled the trigger on the flintlock.\n\nDrystan got *pissed*. He charged straight into the group of nearly 20 pirates, getting pelted with crossbow bolts and swords, only barely being pulled away (and he was most certainly pulled away) with the help of his teammates and in the wake of almost 15 more dead pirates. The mayor was furious, insisting that they were going to bring Barger's wrath down onto them, and indeed more of the town was beginning to be burned in retaliation to their unwilling resistance.\n\nAll this having happened, they sneak back to their ship and start discussing ways to actually strike back at the pirates *without* endangering more of the general populace. (Gota stayed behind because water isn't his thing, yo). They (correctly) conclude that these pirates have zero regards for citizens and start planning for ways to evacuate as many as they can when the young crewmember is spotted eavesdropping. He's ordered to be evacuated with the rest of the town, but the kid gets pissy about it and storms off. Drystan and the other characters write it off (though Drystan's player figured that was going to come back to bite him).\n\nFast forward to the battle they instigate after evacuating a good portion of the town. Lore, while creating distractions (large gunpowder stores and torches) was caught by surprise when a band of pirates figured out what was going on and started looking for the one responsible for the damages. Roborn and Gota leave with the citizens to make sure they can be brought to a safe location and making sure to keep the pirates off their backs. As the pirates started to smash into the town hall, the Drystan finally convinced the mayor to collaborate (as he happens to be an old soldier) and they begin thin the pirates' numbers with sound tactics and traps. Eventually, the pirates were called off, and on the opposite building Barger was holding the crew's kid at the end of a flintlock and demanded that the captain and mayor walk outside, and—I'm so proud of my players—they both threw their arms down, walked out, and were taken, beaten, tortured, and brought aboard the ships.\n\nWhen Gota and Roborn returned, they spoke with the crew and sent a raven and offered to barter with the pirates. All of the money in their ships stores (upwards of 6000 gold), and when the pirates came, I looked hard at the situation. These might be pirates, but they aren't just after money. They want reputation. This is the greatest pirate alive, and he's not going to let someone else win for a pile of gold, but he doesn't want to give up the pile of gold either. So all four captives were laid out: Lore, who was fast becoming Roborn's friend, Drystan, who is needed to lead of the ship's crew and Roborn's close friend, the mayor, the only person with the know-how and connections to rebuild this shattered town and help its citizens, and the kid that ran off in the first place. Roborn arrives at the docks, chest of gold with him, and is put up front as the negotiator of these lives.\n\nThe pirates will only let two go. Any funny business and they kill all four. He was given ten minutes to decide which two, and he used all those minutes debating who's life was worth more than the others, and all combinations led to a loss in some respect. Taking Drystan at all meant that his captain would feel guilty for months or years for being the one that was saved, taking the kid or the mayor meant that he would have to leave one of his party members to be tortured for who knows how long, leaving the mayor meant that the citizens would have no leader. After a lot of thought, Roborn chose to save his party members (and it was real, out of character thought between the two; we stayed up for a few hours last night just talking about the options he really had) and Drystan was *pissed* at him, storming off with his wounds as the child and the mayor were taken back to the pirates' vessel.\n\nAnd they're still talking about how that shit went down. Even though they succeeded at their rolls (except when Drystan almost died in that first combat), their *really* good roleplaying and leaving out a few bodies put them into a situation where every one of their weaknesses were slammed into and hard choices had to be made. Barger himself was not that intimidating of a combatant either, instead relying on his (extremely expensive) pistols and messing with his opponents' heads. And *that* is not something you can put numbers to.\n\nTL;DR shit got fucked, yo. Hide the bodies.",

        "text": "This is the story of my first time as a DM running the lost mines of phandelver. The players being my little brother and one of his friends. My brother chooses the dwarf cleric and his friend the elf wizard.\n\nDisclaimer: this is the first time I ever played the game and as such I winged it when I couldn't figure the rules out quickly.\n\nAfter clearing the first encounter they enter a goblin cave to look for an NPC that has been captured by the goblins. The cave is pitch black and I ask them if either of them have any light. Both of them say no, but the wizard has burning hands as a cantrip. He decides to continually spray the spell to create light. I find nothing in the rules against it and so he starts spreading fire. They round a corner and he unwittingly incinerates a sleeping goblin. \n\nCleric now realizes that hes actually had 10 torches in his inventory and lights one of them instead. They move up through a cave tunnel and into a larger cave. They see a large goblin and four normal ones as well as the NPC they are supposed to save about 60 feet away. Rather than strategize the mage just screams MAGIC MISSILE and lets fly on the bugbear. He rolls poorly on his attack roll but well on his damage roll and I decide he hits one of the other goblins instead. The goblin rolls a natural 1 on his saving throw and explodes in a cloud of pink goo. The Cleric uses one of his light spells but it gas no effect. The combat starts and everyone rolls shitty rolls. No spells hit and no arrows hit. The goblins that are charging the party are closing in and the wizard attempts burning hands. He fails miserably and sprays flame into the air. One goblin attacks him, natural 1 attack roll. Wizard makes saving throw, natural 20. I decide he evades gracefully, trips the goblin and the so it falls and smashes its face into the wall and is knocked unconscious.\n\nThe rest of the combat proceeds with the party rolling well and the enemies rolling shit. Just as the party is about to win the big goblin takes the NPC to a small cliff in the cave and threatens to throw him off. The cleric decides that he is James Bond and throws his handaxe at the big goblin. He doesn't roll well and I decide that he grazes the NPC and cuts off his ear. I do this as a warning as the NPC is valuable to the story. Both of them are rolling in tears after all the crazy misses and now the loss of an ear. Big goblin screams at them, threatening to throw the NPC off the cliff. The wizard now uses his bow to attempt to shoot the goblin. He fails miserably and the arrow hits the NPC in the foot. The big goblin now throws the NPC off the cliff and charges the party. Sadly his face meets the Cleric's warhammer. \n\nThey loot the room, not even bothering to check on the NPC and decide to leave the cave as they don't see any more value in staying. They set up camp just outside the cave and rest. What they didn't know or bother to check is that lower down in the cave there's a miniboss. A bugbear, a wolf and two goblins.\n\nI decide it's natural that the miniboss would know if half of his goblin forces and his hostage were dead and he goes outside to investigate, finding the party sleeping. Both fail their perception checks and the bugbear makes short notice of the cleric's head. The wizard follows suit with the wolf ripping out his throat. No one is left to tell the tale.\n\nLesson: clear enemy lairs or camp somewhere that's not right outside.",

        "text": "To understand this story, it's important that you understand how our game's magic system works. Basically, each spell has a target number that you are attempting to reach by rolling a certain number of dice (the number and type of dice rolled is determined by how you've invested your magic points). \n\nIf any two of the dice rolled are the same number (if you roll doubles), then something mildly bad happens (ghostly voices fill the air, hair stands on end, food spoils, etc.). If you roll triples, then something worse happens (an imp appears and attacks you, you are paralyzed for 1d4 rounds, etc.). If you roll quadruples, something catastrophic happens (1d100 dretches appear, you are sucked into the void and lost forever, etc.)\n\nI don't really remember what was happening in the larger campaign, but our party was in between major quests when we stumbled on a pride of lions. Our magic user then tries to cast a spell (I don't remember what it was, and it failed anyway). \n\nShe rolls doubles. Our DM says, that since nothing on the doubles table is actually consequential, she doesn't have to roll on the table, and we'll just assume nothing happened. However, she insists on rolling on the table.\n\nShe rolls on the doubles table and gets \"roll again on the triples table\". This involves rolling a 95 or above on a d100. \n\nShe rolls on the triples table, and gets \"roll again on the quadruples table\". Like before, this is 95 and above on a d100.\n\nShe rolls on the quadruples table and gets \"You are sucked into the void and lost forever\".\n\nShe then brings up the fact that, at one point while leveling up her character, she rolled a 100 on the level up table, which got her \"you may escape death one time\".\n\nOur DM decides, that since her character went to the void and came back, she's going to get some arcane knowledge. He tells her that she will get one demonic power for free, and she can take as many as she wants after that, but for every power she takes after the first one, she'll get an insanity.\n\nShe replies \"I'll take all of them.\"\n\nWe then spend the better part of an hour rolling demonic powers for her. During this process, she got:\n\n* 1.5 times regular size (meaning she was about eight or nine feet tall)\n* A Sword of Banishment (can banish demons once per day, dispels magical auras, will return after being thrown, no saving throws against it)\n* invulnerable to normal weapons\n* ability to fill target with bliss by touching forehead (50% chance to immobilize)\n* Pavane of Slaanesh (A single enemy within 24 spaces and in line of sight must roll equal to or under his Intelligence on 2d12 or be overcome with emotion, leaping and cavorting uncontrollably. The victim cannot take any action, even to fight back in combat, for the remainder of the expedition, or until the caster is slain or ends the spell.)\n* Fleshy curse (powerful mutagenic spell)\n* Beam of Slaanesh (a beam which fills the target with bliss and renders them immobile until they pass an intelligence check)\n* Goat face\n* Crab claw\n* Set of wings (non-functional)\n* Set of wings (functional)\n* Can cause fear\n* A large, bipedal demonic steed\n* Hermaphroditic (left/right male/female split)\n* Powerful legs (can jump 40 feet)\n* Status of Demon Prince\n\nAs a demon prince, she got a new, randomly-generated name: Taintquiver Ashrip.\n\nFor her insanities she got:\n\n* Foolishness (very) (she may have rolled this more than once)\n* Sadism\n* Psychopathy\n* Quixoticism\n* Amnesia\n* Antipathy\n* Schizophrenia\n* Delusions\n* Kleptomania\n* Instability (subject to lose control every 10 rounds)\n\nAfter all this was done, her stats looked like this (we use the standard 3d6 for stat rolls):\n\n* STR: 22 (+5 modifier)\n* DEX: 11 (+0)\n* CON: 15 (+1)\n* INT: 36 (+12)\n* WIS: 22 (+5)\n* CHA: 11 (+0)\n\nKeep in mind, this all happened in an instant. From the perspective of our characters, she tried to cast a spell, and was replaced by this horrible insane demon who we didn't recognize, and who didn't recognize us (amnesia). She decided to keep playing as the Demon Prince Taintquiver Ashrip, and marched us back into town to begin subjugating the villagers.\n\nOne of the members of the party swore allegiance to her, and she turned him into a two-headed monster with a crab claw and skin dark as the night sky to act as her herald.\n\nAt this point, I asked the DM if I could kill myself. He said yes, but I didn't do it right away.\n\nI remembered that my character (the fighter) had a perk where I could disarm an enemy on a successful hit. Knowing that she had the banishing sword, I decided to challenge her to a fight.\n\nI take a swing at her, and manage to successfully hit her. I take the sword from her and am now wielding it myself. Now, all I have to do is land a hit, and she will be banished to the abyss without a saving throw.\n\nOf course, I miss. She kills me in one hit.\n\nAnother one of our party members picks up the sword. He is Andrew Jackson, seventh president of the United States, who has the ambition \"to become famous\". He takes a swing at Taintquiver Ashrip, and by some miracle, lands a blow. Ashrip and her demonic steed are banished back to the abyss from whence they came, the herald swears his loyalty to Jackson.\n\nFrom that day forward, Andrew Jackson was known as Andrew Jackson the Famous, or Andrew \"the Famous\" Jackson, or The Andrew the Famous The Jackson, or Famous the Andrew the Jackson...",

        "text": "Preface: this was a brief summary of a single session game I played with some folks at a local gaming meetup. Enjoy.\n\nThe setting is that we are a party of three full delta green agents (G-cell) with three friendlies on a mission from A-cell to investigate some missing artifacts and strange behavior from the leader of F-cell, Francis. We were to retire him if necessary.\n\nSo we start to investigate Francis and end up in Chicago. Group splits to check F-cell's greenbox and case his house. House team goes to the house, stumbles through the hedges, talks to the neighbors and shows their real ID's, then are greeted by Francis himself when they stumble over the correct wall, in broad daylight. Suffice to say, the element of surprise was lost.\n\nMeanwhile the artifacts are being found at the greenbox, along with a bunch of random junk and heavy ordance from our grandfather's era. The group meets at their most excellent secret hideout, the hotel's conference room, to make a report to A-cell. The order comes down to retire him anyway.\n\nSo a crafty plan is made. We cut his power, kick the door, shoot him, and run away. Nice. Simple. Nothing could go wrong with a plan like that.\n\nExcept the door is open when we arrive. Nothing is on the first or second floors, but a basement door is discovered and we navigate down into a basement filled with preserved human skins. A trap door is found, but when opened lights and smoke emerge, to which I respond with a grenade. It doesn't explode. The door is opened again and Francis is down there smiling at us, \"Are you coming down or do I need to come up there?\"\n\nNow would be a good time to run, or at least focus fire from our vantage point. What happens is the policewoman jumps down the ladder to kick Francis. The nerdy ufologist, not to be outdone, dives down in a flying headbutt. The leader of G-cell climbs down with his shotgun, and me and two friendlies remain at the top watching in befuddled horror.\n\nThe policewoman shoots Francis in the head, but a Shan starts crawling out of his skull. A round of buckshot phases right through it. Thinking his head a better weapon, the ufologist headbutts the Shan and becomes possessed. Cell leader blows him away with the shotgun and policewoman tries to climb the ladder. Shan phases into the Cell leader and shoots policewoman at the top of the ladder, spraying me with gore. \n\nI tell the friendlies to go to the car, but I forget to give them the keys as i attempt to roll another grenade and slam the door shut. That doesn't work, so I bug out after the friendlies. Cell leader catches up and shotguns me in the yard. Dead. The IRS agent at the car didn't see the Shan phase into Cell leader, so Shan/Cell Leader shows up, unlocks the door, and they drive off into the night to the serenade of approaching sirens.\n\nAnd that folks, is how aliens from Shaggai infiltrated delta green, for the second time.",

        "text": "There isn't really a lot of context for this story. Our GM doesn't pull punches with regards to difficult riddles, and I'd like to see how well you guys can solve this one.\n\nAn impossibly old man sits at a table, his left eye black and shriveled. He has in front of him a wooden board, divided into squares, with twenty-four glass spheres, each about an inch across, arranged like so:\n\n\n\n• | • | • | •  |• \n---|---|----|----|----\n**•**  | **•** | **•** | **•** | **•**\n**•** | **•** |  | **•** | **•**\n**•** | **•** | **•** | **•**| **•**\n**•** | **•** | **•** | **•** | **•**\n\nHe tells you: \"This is a simple game. You may bring only yourself to the table, and if you cannot solve the problem, I will kill you. On each move, you must jump one of the spheres over another sphere and into an unoccupied space. The sphere that was jumped is then removed from the board. you many jump horizontally or veritcally, but you may not jump diagonally. Should you jump a sphere outside of the five by five starting area, I have several more boards with which to expand the field of play, so there is no limit to how far you can move. A sphere may not move without jumping another, and the jumped sphere must always be removed. You win when only one sphere remains on the board. As an added bonus, you may move the blank space in the starting configuration anywhere in the five by five area you like. You may start like this:\"\n\n• | • | • | •  |• \n---|---|----|----|----\n  | **•** | **•** | **•** | **•**\n**•** | **•** | **•** | **•** | **•**\n**•** | **•** | **•** | **•**| **•**\n**•** | **•** | **•** | **•** | **•**\n\n\"Or like this:\"\n\n• | • | • | •  |• \n---|---|----|----|----\n **•** | **•** | **•** | **•** | **•**\n**•** | **•** | **•** | **•** | **•**\n**•** | **•** | **•** | **•**| **•**\n**•** | **•** | **•** | **•** |\n\n\"and so on. You have as much time as you like. Good luck.\"\n\nWe couldn't solve this without hints, but I'd like to see if /r/gametales  can do any better.\n\nEdit: It's come to my attention that it may be possible to solve the puzzle in a way the DM did not intend. The intended solution revolves around the old man's [shriveled, black eye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Vecna). The idea, once you have only two spheres left, is that you have to remove your eye and use it as a sphere to solve the puzzle.",

        "text": "[Pratena Orc](http://imgur.com/Cey1N6l) [was back home](http://redd.it/32cbx6).\n\nIt was kind of odd, though. She never remembered being this small, or seeing all of these weapons strewn about the place, and the skull of thrones was definitely new. It was like a throne of skulls, except that it was a skull made up of tiny thrones. Maybe someone had been renovating.\n\nAnd there was Momorc! Who was dead. Except that she obviously wasn't. And she was smiling! Man, it was good to see her.\n\nMomorc perched upon the skull of thrones and pulled out a storybook. Yeah, storytime! Pratena was going to hear all about the orc heroes of old! Well, maybe not heroes, but certainly warlords. Like Face Puncher, Mace Swinger, Axe Cleaver and Ted. But Momorc looked like she didn't want to tell any of those stories. She had a new book, that looked like someone had skinned an animal and haphazardly stuffed some pages into the resulting mess. Cool.\n\nThis was a story about orcs who tried to conquer a magical society, but kept failing because of magic. So they had to find magic of their own, but all orcs are terrible at figuring out anything more complicated than a broadsword, so it didn't go well. But the orcs didn't give up, because orcs never back down, so they conquered somewhere else... the underplace! With those weird, black-skinned elf things. And then they punched them until they gave up their magic. It made perfect sense, from the orcs' perspective.\n\nAt this point, some massive archangel-thing burst through the front doors and started slamming momorc's face into the wall. Momorc didn't seem to notice, and kept reading. Pratena was getting weirded out.\n\nMomorc (in between deafening crashes and a verbal triade about how monstrous orcs were unclean and must be purged) continued telling the story of the witchorcs, who bound their power into terrifying battle masks, made from the bones of enemies. This only seemed to infuriate the angel-thing, who started flailing around a comically oversized sword made of sunlight. Pratena was throwing dinky little punches at the angel's ankles.\n\nFinally, when momorc was held aloft by her neck, she finally seemed to actually notice the valkyrie-god-thing that was assaulting her, and expressed dull surprise. Then she slammed the animal-skin storybook onto her face, and stabbed herself in her own hand, which somehow made the angel-thing bleed golden fire and start screaming. Then Dadorc showed up, dressed as batman, told Pratena that it was all a dream, and slapped her in the face with a rubber chicken.\n\nPratena woke up, back to her usual size, and utterly confused as to what had just happened. But one thought was stuck in her mind... witchorcs. [Witching](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch). She had to find out about witchcraft. So she promptly leapt out of bed and demanded the secrets of witchcraft out of the resident bard. At three in the morning. After bodily hurling the bard out of bed. Strangely, this did not unlock the secrets of arcane mastery, so she went down into the basement instead. The basement that was filled with a small society of drow.\n\nPratena promptly hunted down the resident drow witch, and politely demanded the secrets of witchcraft over some delightful tea. The drow witch took in Pratena's stature (eight feet tall, built like a truck duct taped to another, bigger truck) and politely asked if Pratena had the right idea (\"Seriously? You're taking on a THIRD character class?\"). Pratena was sure. She was going to punch the secrets of magic out the face of the world, or her name was not Pratena Orc. But unfortunately, [the orc flavor of witchcraft](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-orc/scarred-witch-doctor-witch-orc) required a magical focus- a mask with deep connection to the caster. Pratena set off to find one.\n\nWhat she found was a [bulette](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/magical-beasts/bulette) on her doorstep, tunneling around and mucking up the stonework. She promptly put her foot down on the business (which, coincidentally, launched the bulette out of the ground and put it in striking range), but lost initiative. The bulette mauled Pratena's face with a lucky crit, so Pratena responded with one of her own... in the flavor of [Pummeling Style](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/pummeling-style-combat-style). A gobsmacking 230 damage later, the bulette's skull was traveling upwards at 50kph while its body remained rather stationary.\n\nThat bulette skull was going to make a great mask.",

        "text": "Alright lads gather round I got a tale for ya. Remember if ye find yerself in Hegemony space you didn't hear this from me. Would like to keep my good reputation over there.\n\nSo there I was, working as a freelance bounty hunter in Corvus. Now if'n ye've ever been to the Corvus system ye know they have a hell of a pirate and smuggler problem, and in case ye don't know the Hegemony pays ridiculous sums to bounty hunters who help them deal with it. So I had me a pair of Medusa destroyers and a bunch of Lasher frigates, top of the line weapons and crews that had seen more action than some navies, we had our shop set up in the asteroid belt near Barad A. We kept a rock between us and the pirate base so they couldn't just chase us off, and we'd sit there and wait, then we'd find ourselves a smuggler or some raiders heading out for a run, and we'd run them down as soon as they were clear of the station.\n\n Anyways we'd just found ourselves a big group of smugglers, the rich bastards even had a yacht sailing with them...well those yachts are built like the best of them but we had organization and numbers behind us and we brought it down. So then we start picking through the wreckage, I tell my second to round up anything we might be able to sell and I'll go over it later, and after we got underway I checked the manifest and found we'd picked up enough narcotics and hallucinogenics to hide our shuttle under.\n\nNow it doesn't take a lawyer to tell ya that any amount of those things is highly illegal, so I was a bit concerned for my safety and reputation, the Hegemony trusted me so much for my work as a pirate hunter that I had access codes to their secure comms! I know a payday when I see it though, and I'm no stranger to the black market, so I headed for Jangala, the sector capital!\n\nMy fleet came up on Jangala so casually I was afraid we'd look suspicious, now if'n ye never been there the Jangala starport is a mess even on a slow day. Ye can't tell where the merchants end and the customs officers begin, hell it's not unheard of to be allowed to dock without an inspection, but I swear the whole approach I was afraid one of those picket fleets was gonna come out from behind a superfreighter and flag us down and it would be all over. I swear on my life though they never came, and when we touched down the docking officials even just waved us off to market as we carried off our cargo containers, drugs inside.\n\nI offloaded the drugs on market for SIXTY-EIGHT THOUSAND credits! For nothing more than a quick ambush! So after that I decided to leave quick before anyone could try and arrest me, the docking control lad even wished us farewell and good luck when my second reported that we were heading back out! I got my nerve back pretty soon though and the very next day I came back and bought a full size strike carrier straight from the Hegemony military, with drug money!\n\nAnyways that's the tale of how I flooded the safest market in the sector with hundreds of tons of contraband, and got a carrier for my troubles. Remember now, if anyone asks this is all just a legend!",

        "text": "So, I've been intermittently running a Warhammer Fantasy 2nd Edition campaign for the last couple of years, and thought I'd start writing out a quick recap so the players(and I!) come in with fresh memories when we start again. The basic premise is that the characters joined a trade caravan, the 2nd Kraus Expedition, heading south from the Empire to Araby. They're a fairly diverse lot of characters as Warhammer Fantasy goes, all with their own reasons for joining up. They are:\n\n**Vebur Skullhammer**, Dwarf Troll Slayer\n\nVowing to die in glorious battle, Vebur is chasing a family relic to fulfill his grudge duty to the clan and to himself. He may be young for a dwarf, but he has a dark secret that has made him choose his path of fate; vowing to die in battle is not something dwarfs do lightly. Vebur’s clan name has a root in his family relic, an ancient warhammer of legendary craftsmanship created by the patriarch of clan Skullhammer. Clan legends also tell of an ancient “forge of the gods”, located far to the south in the deserts of Araby. Centuries ago, Vebur’s great-great-uncle, Verrick Skullhammer, also a slayer, took the hammer and ventured south in search of the forge. He was ashamed at the clan’s diminishing importance and loss of respect for their past. Verrick was never to be seen again. Vebur now seeks the Skullhammer and the truth about what happened to his great-great uncle to restore his clan to the greatness and respect it had mere centuries ago.\n\n **Axel Muffins**, Halfling Fieldwarden\n \nQuick, cunning, and always ready to get a word in edgewise, this halfling's cheerful and positive demeanor hides a more morbid past. The loss of his expedition party to the necromancer Dramesh drove him from his once proud life in the moot. Left with nowhere to turn, Axel led the survivors on a journey of survival across the highways and byways of the empire and its surrounding territories. When his ragtag group was ambushed, Axel was seperated and many of his friends taken captive by bandits. Left only with a simple sling and the skills he learned in his time as a fieldwarden, Axel tries his best to live, thrive, and survive in a world that is unforgiving to humans, and even more so to halflings. Looking only for place to rest his head and fill his belly, Axel joined up with Marcus Kraus' caravan with aspirations of finding a new, better life in the lands south of the empire. He still hopes to one day reunite with his friends, kill the bandits that took them, and take revenge on the necromancer that tore him from the carefree life he once knew.\n\n**Rigg D’Elvegar**, Human Tradesman\n\nRigg grew up the youngest of four brothers. His father died when he was 7, leaving his mother and three elder brothers to tend the house. Rigg, being the youngest, was often left without work to do and thus grew up resenting responsibility. His mother owned a curiosity shop in Hergig, the capital of Hochland, which sold the trinkets and antiques from all over the world that made their way to Hergig. He would often rummage through the antiques in the shop, eventually finding a fascination with the few early firearms that had made their way to the shop. In his adult years, Rigg became a tradesman and brewer, always aspiring to greater but stymied by his own aversion to responsibility and lowly beginnings. Realizing he had become middle aged with not much to show of it, Rigg packed up shop and headed south to make something of his life, where he found a role as apprentice under Gregor Friemann in the 2nd Kraus Expedition. \n\n**Helden Rommstagg**, Human Apprentice Wizard \n\nHelden was born on a cattle farm in Wissenland with no idea that he would grow to become a wizard of Shyish. However, his peculiar amethyst eyes marked him from birth as touched by magic, and as a result he grew up an outcast. It was only by chance that a passing Amethyst Magister, looking for a tribe of ghouls rumored to be in the area, passed through the farm and took Helden to Altdorf to be trained as a wizard. Helden’s path through the college was hindered by circumstance and his lack of a work ethic, despite his aptitude for magic, and he was still an apprentice at the age of thirty. After the Storm of Chaos and with Amethyst resources stretched paper-thin, Helden, the most senior and talented apprentice, was sent south to find aa Magister named Ludevicus, vanished hunting the necromancer Dramesh, who had long been an enemy of the College. And Helden has been having recollections of a half-forgotten childhood, spent under the tutelage of someone calling himself the Ghoul King... \n\n**Nikkel Roklept**, Human Grave Robber\n\nA simple, lower class boy in a city near the borders of the empire. Originally having the goal of being an artist, his life was relatively average until all went to hell at the age of 12, when his father unexpectedly left, bringing his families wealth with him.He was left to fend for himself and his little brother, their mother now too depressed and drunk to be of any use. The next few years were spent on the brink of survival. He took work wherever he could find it, growing cold and bitter towards the world. His brother grew ill, his mother insane. When he was about 16, they could no longer afford to keep their home. Ironically, this is where his luck took a turn. While packing and preparing to leave, he discovered a sealed chest formerly belonging to his father. The contents included a spade, some odd trinkets, and a set of encrypted maps. One map detailed the whereabouts of his great grandfather’s grave, the others seemed to lead all over the world, but are yet to be decoded. The map of his grandfather’s grave detailed a vast amount of wealth hidden within. This being possibly the only way to save his family, he headed out, spade in hand, to find this fortune. The quest proved fruitful, and he now supports his brothers schooling and his mother’s treatment from afar. He found he had a skill when it came to reaping from the dead, thus his current occupation. But the mysteries of his father’s disappearance, the chest, and the encrypted maps remain, and he seeks to one day solve them. \n\nAnd here's their first adventure. I'm sure this will make more sense to Warhammer nerds like myself, but you should be able to get the broad strokes of the story without knowing the setting info.\n\n**Adventure 1: Big Trouble in Little Greenarrow**\n\nThe Second Kraus Expedition set off from Wissenland, heading south through the Border Princes. Having been turned away from all settlements so far on account of the many refugees the expedition brought with it, the group made camp in an unassuming stretch of woods in the southern Border Princes. Hearing tell of a Roadwarden station just up the road, the restless party set out to find something to do, little knowing what they were about to get into. There, the sole Roadwarden in the station told them of a bounty on mutants and Beastmen in the woods, focusing around the small town of Greenarrow two days travel away. The party decided to investigate in search of coin and adventure, and solicited the help of two mercenaries traveling with the caravan, Otto and Halberd. The next night, the party was awakened by something moving in the woods nearby, but when they investigated they found only the tracks of cloven hooves. The party and the mercenaries took a detour from the rest of the caravan to reach Greenarrow, so named for the massive tree rising above the rest of the forest. They found an isolated, xenophobic town terrified of the recent abductions by mutants. Having found from the relatively friendly innkeeper that the mutants came at night, the party decided to wait until nightfall. In the interim, they negotiated with the bedridden mayor about their reward. This kind of thing would quickly become a running trend.  \n\nAfter finding rooms in the local tavern, they were awakened by the screams of the innkeeper’s wife-her son had been abducted by the mutants. The party gave chase into the woods and towards the gargantuan tree, finding a circle of mutants, their warped forms illuminated by a flickering fire, circling and chanting around the boy, performing some kind of dark ritual. The party’s forward scouts saw the boy’s flesh twist and change, wracked by the energies of Chaos, before they entered battle and disrupted the ritual. After defeating the mutated fiends, the party recovered the boy, who was seemingly fine albeit comatose. Helden, however, saw signs of dark energies still lingering and decided to keep a careful eye on the child and try to cure him. They returned in the early hours of the morning and decided to get what sleep they could before leaving. The next day was a cold and rainy one, with the boy showing no signs of improving. Helden managed to perform a ritual to remove most of the taint and bind what was left. However, his ritual and the party’s breakfast were interrupted by an angry mob seeking to kill the boy for his taint-word travels fast in small towns.  \n\nFortunately, Axel, taking to the top of a barrel to address the crowd, was able to talk the mob down. They sullenly retired to their homes as the rain grew even heavier. Helden, on the second floor, tried to return to his work only to interrupted again, this time by his Witchsight. He detected a strong dark energy moving towards the town. The rest of the group, with their mortal vision, saw a very large shape silhouetted by the rain, advancing out of the forest. As it got closer they realized what it was-a hideous Ogre, mutated by Chaos, with cloven hooves for legs and wielding a huge tree branch fashioned into a crude axe. Clearly it was what had made the tracks they saw earlier. Steeling themselves, the party charged into battle. Fortunately, the ogre was slow and dumb, and despite absorbing an unnatural amount of damage it began to fall under the party’s assault without landing a decisive hit. During the fight, the supposedly bedridden mayor approached Rigg. Before he comprehend what was truly happening, the mayor revealed an arm twisted into a black spur from beneath the folds of his cloak and grievously injured Rigg. As Vebur finished off the mutant with a crushing blow from his hammer, Otto rushed forwards and impaled the mayor, killing the mutant and saving Rigg.  \n\nWith the ogre’s corpse still cooling in the rain, the party collected their meager recompense, bandaged their wounds and set off to rejoin the caravan, after a brief stop at a Roadwarden station to collect the bounty.  \n  ",

The next few years were spent on the brink of survival. He took work wherever he could find it, growing cold and bitter towards the world. His brother grew ill, his mother insane. When he was about 16, they could no longer afford to keep their home. Ironically, this is where his luck took a turn. While packing and preparing to leave, he discovered a sealed chest formerly belonging to his father. The contents included a spade, some odd trinkets, and a set of encrypted maps. One map detailed the whereabouts of his great grandfather’s grave, the others seemed to lead all over the world, but are yet to be decoded. The map of his grandfather’s grave detailed a vast amount of wealth hidden within. This being possibly the only way to save his family, he headed out, spade in hand, to find this fortune. The quest proved fruitful, and he now supports his brothers schooling and his mother’s treatment from afar. He found he had a skill when it came to reaping from the dead, thus his current occupation. But the mysteries of his father’s disappearance, the chest, and the encrypted maps remain, and he seeks to one day solve them.\n\nThe premise of the campaign is that they all joined a trade caravan traveling to Araby through the Border Princes to accomplish their goals, the 2nd Kraus Expedition. \n\n**Adventure 1: Big Trouble in Little Greenarrow**\n\nThe Second Kraus Expedition set off from Wissenland, heading south through the Border Princes. Having been turned away from all settlements so far on account of the many refugees the expedition brought with it, the group made camp in an unassuming stretch of woods in the southern Border Princes. Hearing tell of a Roadwarden station just up the road, the restless party set out to find something to do, little knowing what they were about to get into. There, the sole Roadwarden in the station told them of a bounty on mutants and Beastmen in the woods, focusing around the small town of Greenarrow two days travel away. The party decided to investigate in search of coin and adventure, and solicited the help of two mercenaries traveling with the caravan, Otto and Halberd. The next night, the party was awakened by something moving in the woods nearby, but when they investigated they found only the tracks of cloven hooves. The party and the mercenaries took a detour from the rest of the caravan to reach Greenarrow, so named for the massive tree rising above the rest of the forest. They found an isolated, xenophobic town terrified of the recent abductions by mutants. Having found from the relatively friendly innkeeper that the mutants came at night, the party decided to wait until nightfall. In the interim, they negotiated with the bedridden mayor about their reward. This kind of thing would quickly become a running trend.\n\nAfter finding rooms in the local tavern, they were awakened by the screams of the innkeeper’s wife-her son had been abducted by the mutants. The party gave chase into the woods and towards the gargantuan tree, finding a circle of mutants, their warped forms illuminated by a flickering fire, circling and chanting around the boy, performing some kind of dark ritual. The party’s forward scouts saw the boy’s flesh twist and change, wracked by the energies of Chaos, before they entered battle and disrupted the ritual. After defeating the mutated fiends, the party recovered the boy, who was seemingly fine albeit comatose. Helden, however, saw signs of dark energies still lingering and decided to keep a careful eye on the child and try to cure him. They returned in the early hours of the morning and decided to get what sleep they could before leaving. The next day was a cold and rainy one, with the boy showing no signs of improving. Helden managed to perform a ritual to remove most of the taint and bind what was left. However, his ritual and the party’s breakfast were interrupted by an angry mob seeking to kill the boy for his taint-word travels fast in small towns.\n\nFortunately, Axel, taking to the top of a barrel to address the crowd, was able to talk the mob down. They sullenly retired to their homes as the rain grew even heavier. Helden, on the second floor, tried to return to his work only to interrupted again, this time by his Witchsight. He detected a strong dark energy moving towards the town. The rest of the group, with their mortal vision, saw a very large shape silhouetted by the rain, advancing out of the forest. As it got closer they realized what it was-a hideous Ogre, mutated by Chaos, with cloven hooves for legs and wielding a huge tree branch fashioned into a crude axe. Clearly it was what had made the tracks they saw earlier. Steeling themselves, the party charged into battle. Fortunately, the ogre was slow and dumb, and despite absorbing an unnatural amount of damage it began to fall under the party’s assault without landing a decisive hit. During the fight, the supposedly bedridden mayor approached Rigg. Before he comprehend what was truly happening, the mayor revealed an arm twisted into a black spur from beneath the folds of his cloak and grievously injured Rigg. As Vebur finished off the ogre with a crushing blow from his warhammer, Otto the mercenary rushed forwards and impaled the mayor, killing the mutant and saving Rigg.\n\nWith the ogre’s corpse still cooling in the rain, the party collected their meager recompense, bandaged their wounds, and set off to rejoin the caravan, after a brief stop at a Roadwarden station to collect the bounty. \n\nSo yeah, that's part one. If you have any questions about the characters or what happened in the story, feel free to ask. I'll probably post the next one of these tomorrow or the day after.       ",

        "text": "So, I have undertaken the ridiculous task of taking the Demigods greentext and making it into a game. Here is my tale, which is still being written.\n\nAs an avid member of my High School's TG club, I decided to undertake in creating this game after reading the Greentext. After spreading word of it to my friends, they quickly wanted to join.\n\nFirst is my friend D, playing \"Doc Holiday\" (I kid you not). He follows Hermiena, goddess of Fate, Knowledge, Memory, and Dreams. His divine power is the ability to determine somethings luck with the flip of a coin, be it a mortal or an object.\n\nNext is B, playing Mohammed (yeah). Of course, B decided he wanted to be a demigod of Camorah, the goddess of Revelry, Debauchery, Emotions, and Indulgences. (\"Well, Mohammed isn't in this world, so it doesn't mean anything!\" sigh.) He is a sadist, a masochist, a murderer, and his power is that he is a \"self voodoo doll.\"\n\nThen, there's J, playing Relos, a demigod of Kyrayne, the goddess of nature, the heavens, and the elements. He has a slight pyrokinetic habit.\n\nNext is H, playing a demigod of Belor, the god of War, Strength, and Heroes. He took the role of a key combatant, and is proficient with every weapon he handles.\n\nLastly in this first session is I, playing a demigod of Nyr, the god of Destruction, Change, and Reconstruction. His power is to be able to touch anything and destroy it (to an extent).\n\nThese demigods did enough pleasing to their god that they Ascended to demigods, be it during life or after death. They started after exiting the Hall of the Divines, a hall on a different plane of existence, and coming out on the Shizdushol Highlands.\n\n(Here is the map for reference: http://i.imgur.com/K0Cdpwn.jpg)\n\nThey made the \"decision\" to team up, as it would be easier to play with their newfound divinity together. They then started going south, and eventually stumbled upon a mining camp. Doc Holiday stays true to his name, and instantly finds someone to play games and gamble with in the mining camp's rest area. He does this while Relos is busy making mortals think he is a witch (magic is REALLY taboo in this world. There are only 3 major safe havens) and almost dying. Inside the rest area, while the gambling occurs, one NPC is gambling way more than he should. When Doc asks about this, and why he's gambling everything instead of spending it on his family, (roll) he replies: \"They died in a mine collapse.\"\n\nAaaaaand Mohammed laughs.\n\n    \"B. Roll.\"\n\nWe do an opposed roll (this was before I refined the system a bit). He loses, and gets a pickaxe to the head.\n\nHe woke up in the Hall of the Gods, and felt the strong urge to go to Camorah's hall. Quite simply, it is a sex dungeon.\n\n    \"What the hell? I give you divinity, and you die in less than a week?\"\n\nThose two chat for a bit, and then she sends him on his way, resulting in a two day journey back to the camp.\n\nMeanwhile, Doc has been \"losing\" (he cursed his own die, and blessed the owner's die) to the owner of the mine. The owner was getting very confident, and decided to bet the mine. This was when the gears started turning in D's head. He puts his game chest in the pool, then swaps the curse/blessing on the dice.\n\nThe owner had no chance.\n\nWithin a week of divinity, they now owned a mine.\n\nBy the time B (Mohammed) returns, Doc has already taken things into his own hands. He has calmed the miners about Relos, found barbarians for H to go recruit into his army, and generally gathered information. He also somehow managed to convince everyone that Mohammed was really still alive after a pickaxe to the head, so by the time he returned, Doc pulled him into and subsequently out of a tent, exclaiming \"He's okay!\"\n\nYeah. This is the way this is going.\n\nSo Mohammed goes on his little path of vengeance against this miner, and self voodoos the shit out of himself. The miner is bleeding profusely from his arm, and his tounge.\n\nAnd Mohammed, being the masochist he is, is \"rock hard.\"\n\nI, who has not done much this session, decides to ask about the mines and what they do.\n\n    \"Oh, not much. We just generally mine iron and ship it around. We think we were about to run into a cave, but there was a collapse in the tunnel.\"\n\nI was very curious, and went into the mines, followed by Doc. Upon reaching the collapse, he used his power on the rocks, and discovered a cavern. It was no ordinary cavern, though, as it contained an alter to Kyrayne.\n\nRelos was instantly grabbed, and was overjoyed at this altar. He started praying rather quickly, and asked if he was doing well.\n\n    \"Yes. You have not strayed from me, my child.\"\n\nHe gets up and says:\n\n    \"Let's build loads of mini statues and put them everywhere.\"\n\n    The party: \"Lol no.\"\n\nAnd then, that's really where the first session ends. Most of it was really unrefined and experimental. Apologies for my awful storytelling. To be continued when I'm not lazy.",

        "text": "This tale comes from a game one of my friends DM'ed. The campaign had been going on for a while and through various circumstances we'd lost players and gained others but I was the only player who had been consistently coming to sessions.\n\nI was playing a silly damage spell wizard who spent a large portion of his gold on a rod of lesser maximize earlier in the campaign.\n\nThe main reason I bought the damn rod was that normally when it comes to rolling in combat, be it to hit, initiative, for saves or for damage, I would usually roll pretty badly.\n\nIt got so bad at one point that in one combat I had 3 separate spells backfire on me with natural 1s. My reasoning was that with the rod, at least when I managed to hit something the damage would be good.\n\nThen came the session of destiny. In this session the party was investigating the arctic lair of an arch-mage. This mage had been causing problems for our party for a long time and was the boss of this part of the campaign.\n\nSo we enter his ice lair, and do the standard dungeon crawling thing until we come across a pitfall spike trap. We detect it in time and my wizard flies a rope across the gap. After the party gets across we get attacked by some sort of magically enhanced magic yeti. *Roll Initiative*\n\nI roll higher than normal (18), and go first in the combat. I try to cast a spell but the DM tells me that my wizard feels the presence of a silence field all around him. So I turn around and see the old Arch-mage flanking us from behind.\n\nThe next round my wizard pulls out a Wand of Enfeeblement from his pouch and zaps the Arch-mage with it while he's over the pit of spikes.\nI connect with the attack and roll Max on the STR damage.\n\nThe Arch-mage being an old man, has a very low STR score and this puts him at 0 STR. The DM interprets 0 STR as not even having the strength to stay conscious so he tells us that the Arch-mage falls 50ft into the pit of spikes and dies. \n\nI think the DM was a little peeved that I killed the boss of the last 2-3 months of the campaign with one shot of a wand of enfeeblement, because after we easily dispatched the yeti and made it outside the mage's lair, he told us that we saw a Frost dragon attacking us.\n\nI think he only sent that dragon at us because he wanted there to be an actual boss fight that lasts more than a couple rounds, but the dice did not have this in mind today.\n\nSo we roll initiative and I go first again (which is nearly unheard of in our group). On my first action my wizard casts fly on himself and flies up to the frost dragon to prevent it from just bombarding the party from midair. The party ranger gets a couple arrows in on the first round too.\n\nThen on the second round I use my lesser rod of maximize to attack the frost dragon with a scorching ray.\n\nRoll to hit:   20\nRoll to confirm crit:   20\n\n12d6 maximized scorching ray x 2 x Frost dragon's fire weakness = 2 dead bosses in 2 attacks in one session.\n\n... and one exasperated DM describing how badass my wizard was for the rest of the session.",

        "text": "At then end of the last part, shit had been wrecked and another god damn triple twenty had been rolled. The party had explored nearly every room of the dungeon, but they had yet to find Griffith, the Big Boss who had imprisoned them earlier and was their whole reason for being in this dungeon.\n\nAfter looting the magical mineral storage and finding a mysterious magical key on a 100 loot roll (it opens a secret plot point later on), the PCs discover a dark hall filled with glass cases, their contents obscured by illusion magic. Each case has a name plate on the bottom, and the fighter reads the closest one to him: \"The Crown of the Damned King.\" The players immediately begin to argue over whether they should try to open the case, this goes nowhere for some time. Then He Who Gets Shit Done declares that he has an idea, and casts Scrying. In the reflection on the glass he scrys Griffith, who fails the check to notice that he is being observed. The PCs see him exerting extraordinary amounts of power from his Win Button amulet in an attempt to subdue a captive Demon Lord. I give them enough details about their surroundings to give them the means to find him in the dungeon, but then someone suggests that the sorcerer (whose player was not there and whose character, thus, was being played as an NPC follower for the session) use Teleport. He has the spell slot available. I remain smug, however, because there's a high chance he'll fuck up the spell with a target location he's never been to. Then I notice that the Very Familiar condition includes if the user is looking at the target location when they cast the spell. Pass Without A Trace is used, and then the sorcerer rolls to teleport them right behind Griffith.\n\nIt works.\n\nGriffith fails to notice the PCs as they warp into existence directly behind him. They stand, silent and nearly invisible, and there is a momentary pause. I know what is about to happen. Griffith does not, and all the infinite power of his amulet cannot save him if he doesn't get a chance to use it. Six simultaneous turns are taken, and six high-level characters simultaneously unleash their most overpowered bullshit in Attacks of Opportunity into the back of this unsuspecting boss. I don't need to tell you what they did. Only that the end result was 909 damage and a fine red mist where my boss once stood.\n\nMotherfucking sigh.\n\nShortly afterward, the imprisoned Demon Lord and his army begin to wake up and get a little salty about the whole situation, so the party wisely decides to GTFO, abandoning the mysterious Crown and whatever other treasures may have been hidden in the dungeon. As the whole place was located inside a pocket dimension that had been sustained by Griffith, it is a simple matter once they all escape to collapse the whole thing behind them, eradicating the demons in the process. All that's left to do is address Griffith's amulet. Upon inspection, it is discovered that the relic actually contains the soul of one of their former companions (he pulled the \"soul sucked out of your body and imprisoned elsewhere\" card from the Deck of Many Things), named Blake. The amulet he'd been imprisoned in had been found by Griffith, and Blake had been providing him his unlimited power against his will. \n\nI had decided back when this character was with us that he was a Fount, someone within my homebrew setting whose soul produces an infinite amount of magical energy. Mortals can't harness the power of a Fount without burning up their souls in the process, so it wouldn't have given the player any unfair advantages. Griffith, however, had possessed the Eye and Hand of Veccna, allowing him to safely channel the power of the Fount's soul, with disastrous results.\n\nThe PCs were initially thrilled to be reunited with their old friend, but the mood quickly sobered when Blake revealed that Griffith had left his soul corrupted and in agony, and he begged the PCs to end his suffering. The secretly LE character was the one to pick him up initially, so it was looking like Blake wasn't getting his peace. Knowing that he can't use Blake's power himself, however, he gives the amulet to the paladin to see if his corruption can be fixed. Being all kinds of good, the paladin grants Blake's request to let him speak to the sorcerer, who was Blake's close friend for many years before the two joined the current party. Much passes between them telepathically, and the other PCs see a tear roll down the goliath's cheek. I know the player of the sorcerer and the character he's been building pretty well, so I feel confident that I know what he would do. The sorcerer crushes the amulet in his hand, and frees his friend's soul at long last. Wisps of pure white float up from the dust of the artifact, and a gentle breeze flows past the group. The characters fancy for a moment that it sounds almost like a sigh of relief.\n\nHaving achieved a rare emotional response from my players, I end the session happily. There was cheese, there were lols, and there were feels by the end, and that to me marks a successful session. Bizarre? Yes. But it's business as usual for these chucklefucks.",

        "text": "When I left off last, the party was heading to a jungle temple to scout out what was causing so much distress in the ape population, or at least they would have had they not been knocked out cold.\n\n After the party woke up and the drugs have been mostly purged from their bodies they headed out with Taggert. Vay Hek stayed on the trail with Kerroe and Taggert while Grimross and numb-nuts (Connery) trailed them in the foliage.\n\n  They ran into a couple of random encounters, nothing special, just a band of Lizardmen, a velociraptor type Dinosaur, and a Tiger. They breezed through the encounters with no issues and Connery doing absolutely nothing in any of the fights, except the last one. I suppose that Connery got tired of doing nothing and decided that he wanted to be 'useful'. Connery stealthed around the Tiger and last hit it, by shoving his sap up the Tiger's ass. I really did not like this character.\n\n Connery did nothing but say how he wanted to kill shit with his sap and fought tooth and nail about getting fish hooks to accessorize his sap. He also complained about getting sunglasses but we'll get to that later.\n\n  Anyways, they reach the temple and find it to be over run with raging apes. The party rolls initiative and ends the fight shortly afterwards because Gunslingers are strong as shit and one hit almost anything I throw at them. When the fight ends Taggert senses a horde of Lizardmen mobilizing on their location and tells the party to enter the temple and blockade it while he holds them off. Of course the group doesn't listen because they want to see him turn into a werewolf and murder about a hundred Lizardmen. Taggert wasn't a werewolf and they were wasting time so Taggert forced them into the temple but the party wasn't having it.\n\n I should probably explain that no one in the party knew of the Goblin's existence besides Vay Hek. The party had to roll perception anytime the Goblin did anything but no one rolled high enough. The party almost wiped each other out because they really wanted to know what was in Vay Hek's chest, in character anyways. Also, if you didn't know, Alchemists have a potion that lets them shapeshift into monsters and such with the right ingredients, this is extremely important to note. The Goblin also talks like Yoda, not that important but I forgot to mention it earlier.\n\n  The Goblin was just as curious as the rest of the party and decided that he would sneak out of the temple and see what was going on. The rest of the party was too distracted with trying to peek through the blockade to notice the Goblin sneak away through a smaller crack in the temple wall. To keep his existence a mystery, he chugged a potion he made earlier to change himself into a lizardman. So the Goblin now had front row seats to the fight but instead of watching Taggert change into a horrible slobbering Wolf-Man, Taggert kept fighting with his sword, cleaving Lizardmen apart one after another. When all the Lizardmen were dead, Taggert collapsed into the corpses and took a nap. By this point the Goblin was completely caught up in the moment and forgot two things.\n1.The potion wore off\n2. That the party didn't know of his existence\nSo, the Goblin crawls back into the temple and walks right up to the party and \"Crazy it is, out there do not go\". Needless to say, the party was stunned and the room was enveloped in silence. Playing in character, Kerroe stepped forward believing the Goblin to be an enemy, and literally punted the little bastard into a wall, almost killing him.\n\n Vay Hek wasn't too pleased  about this development and attacked Kerroe. Ending part 2.\n\nIf you guys are still interested, I'll post part 3 as soon as I can.",

        "text": "I am lucky enough to have a group of players who are willing to test out a game that my friend and I made and they had a session that was arguably the best action scene I have ever been part of in a game.\n\nBackground: This game is based around giant monsters, robots, superheroes, etc. It's set in an alternate history where these things have been around since the 50's and the world has adjusted accordingly. \n\nA force had invaded the city of Dubai, burying the city under a mutant plant. All attempts to make it into the city were pushed back by ground forces comprised of giants and their trained monsters. Air strikes were thwarted by a special giant, named Watchtower, standing on the top of the Burj Khalifa the tallest building in the world, who was shooting down all incoming planes before they could reach the city limits.\n\nThe players' characters:\n\n*Ace!: A young man who moonlighted as a size-changing superhero.\n*Poncho: A crazy man who likes to whip himself around giants and hit them with a sword.\n*Ajay: A slightly-less crazy man who takes a more sensible approach to hitting giants with a sword.\n*Alice Marlow: A former pilot who picked up mercenary work piloting a mech she got second-hand from a staged monster fighting show from Japan. The OS is in Japanese and causes the mech, JetMax, to sporadically scream Japanese catch-phrases and blast its theme song.\n\nPlayers all had active communication devices to know what each-other was doing.\n\nPoncho, Ace, and Ajay used scuba gear to approach the city from the Gulf of Oman, hoping their human forms would allow them to sneak past the giants patrolling the streets. They were spotted.\n\nAce transformed and engaged multiple giants with Ajay while Poncho made a bee-line for the tower.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice geared-up JetMax with explosives she procured from a military base-camp trying to re-take the city and blasted off to aid her comrades (JetMax was the only member of the party capable of flight).\n\nJetMax routed some of the giants converging on Ace and Ajay, dropping bombs on their adversaries. Alice landed JetMax to finish-off the wounded giants with her beam-gun while the mech's peppy theme music blared.\n\nPoncho, on his way to the tower, ran into one of the last friendly mechs in the city, North Guard, one of the four mechs that protects the city. Poncho used his grappling hook to slash at the head of one of the attacking enemy giants while North Guard finished off the other, Poncho quickly resumed his trek to the tower.\n\nJetMax, having finished its work, flew to the top of the Bruj Khalifa and began an aerial battle with Watchtower. \n\nPoncho arrived next, furiously shooting his grappling hook in order to reach the top of the building and join the fight. \n\nIt should be noted that a giant stands at 150ft average in this game. The Bruj Khalifa is 2,717ft.\n\nAce and Ajay, having dealt with their enemies, arrived at the foot of the tower where they fought off a few of the remaining enemies.\n\nPoncho managed to make it close enough to JetMax and Watchtower's fight that he took a leap of faith and fired his grappling hook. He latched onto Watchtower and pulled himself in to strike at the creature's head, only to miss and cut his own grappling cord.\n\nPoncho plummeted from the battle, too far from the tower to slow himself from terminal velocity.\n\nLuckily, Ace had begun to scale the tower not long before, carrying Ajay with him as they tried to join the battle. \n\nThe battle between Alice/JetMax and Watchtower was evenly matched. They met each other blow for blow and would not give ground.\n\nThe stalemate was broken by Ajay, taking a page from Poncho's playbook, who got Ace to throw him at the dogfight. Ajay landed squarely between the shoulder-blades of Watchtower, distracting him enough for Alice/JetMax to break his defense.\n\nWatchtower fell from the sky with Ajay attached. Alice cut JetMax's thrusters and dove at her enemy with her mech's sword, skewering it.\n\nAce, thinking of his friend, dove from the tower to grab Ajay. Ace, holding Ajay and Poncho, was lucky enough to have his fall broken by Watchtower's corpse while Alice safely landed JetMax nearby.\n\n\nTL;DR: My players put together a brilliant action set-piece that I couldn't see coming. Complete with battles in war-torn cities, guys with grappling hooks and swords fighting giant monsters, aerial dogfights, and a man being thrown over a thousand feet into the air to strike an enemy exponentially larger than them.

There's not an innocent in the whole damn city.\n\n----\n\nJohnson called us up for a job. Some high-up research type had been kidnapped and Charlie wanted a ransom. The guy wasn't worth enough to pay the ransom, but Johnson figured he was worth enough to pay a few poor saps to run in there with guns, maybe get him back, maybe get killed. Payment on delivery; package must be breathing.\n\nOur team's light on Astral, so we hired a friendly mage named Squid to help us search and provide backup. A day of working with Sparky, our decker engineer, plus yours truly doing the legwork, and we'd found the target - forty floors up in the middle of downtown. Squid said the target was tied up on a chair in a small room. Two guards in the room, another twenty outside the room, another thirty on the floor above, another fifteen on the floor below. See, turned out Charlie owned two and a half floors in this place and was treating it like a fortress; guns, security, guns, armor, guns. Plus a hell of a conjurer hanging around just in case. Squid decided she didn't want to be within five blocks of him when things went down, so we had an involved discussion, then got half our money back and decided to tackle it on our own.\n\nGood news for us, the place wasn't built as a fortress. They'd stashed our target in a soundproof closet, sure, but right below that was a legal firm. The firm's owner was friends with the building owner and Charlie wasn't paying enough to encourage an eviction. Blasting our way through their front door would have been suicide, but if we could get in that firm, we could get right next to our target.\n\nWe found the firm's owner hanging out in a seedy bar and asked him what he wanted for the keys to the place. He wanted sex and money. We interpreted this as money and money. One cheap whore and one credstick later, we were heading back home with his keyring, grabbing our guns, and making tracks for the building.\n\nWheels brought his car into the parking garage, right next to the elevator and aimed straight at the exit. Easy enough to hack the building security from there; anyone watching the monitors would just see a parked car. Wheels stayed there \"to make evac faster and keep an eye on things\", which sounded like a good idea as long as you forgot his part in that incident last year. But frag it, good idea regardless, and he'd use his drones to watch the building.\n\nWhat do you call an elf, a dwarf, a troll, and a duffel bag in an office elevator? Crowded. That's what you call it. Brick hefted the bag up to his waist just to give Sparky enough room to work, and in the meantime I'm squished up in the corner like a pointy-eared green bean trying to guess which wall is most likely to explode in bullets. Just when we're about to call the whole thing Sparky says the cameras are off, the hall's empty, and now's our chance to get in position. We take it.\n\nSo there we are, hiding in a legal firm's conference room, ten feet from the target, separated by a flimsy office ceiling, with an entire security force waiting to kill us.\n\nTime for Plan A.\n\nThe duffel held a few fancy toys, courtesy Sparky's contacts and machine shop. Brick and I pull out a pair of silenced rifles with ultrasound sights, Sparky got the laser cutting torch. Two quick shots aimed up and there's no more living guards in the closet, so Sparky gets on Brick's shoulders and starts carving a circle in the ceiling.\n\nHe almost finishes.\n\nWheels says there's action. Lots of action. His camera drone's too far away to see detail, but where there were a few lights in the windows, now there's a lot of lights and a lot of movement. Maybe they heard the ultrasound, maybe they heard the torch, maybe Sparky botched the hack; whatever. Cover's blown.\n\nTime for Plan B.\n\nBrick punches the ceiling, which shatters, as expected. He leaps up, grabs the target and chair, and dives for the hole in the floor as the closet door explodes in splinters and shotgun pellets.\n\nSparky and Brick run for the elevator. The conference room dissolves in gunfire, but for some reason none of their guards seem eager to jump down into a room with an angry wounded troll, so they have a tough time hitting anything. I head for the elevator along with them, but running's kinda my thing, so I get there while they're still dodging desks. Bad news for me, a few guards from our floor are there as well; bad news for them, shooting's kinda my thing too. I hunker down in the hallway and make sure we're the only living things in it. Sparky dives into the elevator while Brick unloads his shotgun at a guard who opens the fire escape door at the wrong moment. Sparky and I cover the hall while Brick rips the target right out of his chair - you don't need intact bones to breathe - and we somehow jam ourselves in the elevator and get it started.\n\nTurns out an office elevator isn't any larger when you add a fourth person. We reload anyway, yours truly dodging a troll elbow in the process. Brick blasts the elevator's ceiling out to look for targets, finds some, blasts them. With all the noise, I barely hear the sound of breaking metal beneath us, accompanied by Wheels yelling for us to *shoot straight down right now*.\n\nFrag it, Wheels is a reliable guy. I mean, besides that incident last year, but can't fault a guy for saving his own skin. I flip my SMG to full auto and unload it, straight down, as requested.\n\nI see flames through every hole in the elevator floor.\n\nSeconds later, a fireball with a screaming face plows through the floor, rebounds off the wall, rockets through what's left of the ceiling, melts straight through the elevator cable, and keeps on going.\n\nWe fall five stories. Brick later said he saved our target by cushioning the fall. I think Brick lost his balance and accidentally fell the right way. I don't know which one of us pulled the inner elevator door open, but that fire elemental had melted the outer one into a puddle. We piled into Wheels' slightly scorched car - the damn spirit had raced straight for the elevator, hadn't even gone around the vehicles - and left patches of melted rubber as we got the drek out of there.\n\nWent home, got paid. I hear the target's going to be healing for a month but at least he's alive.\n\nSo anyway, that was last weekend. What've you been up to?",

        "text": "As an elf approached the entrance to the Adventurer's Guild, a guardsman held his palm towards him.\n\n\"Halt! I do not recognise you. State your name and business!\"\n\n\"I am Izkrael, an elf ranger seeking to find adventure and slay a powerful dragon so that my name shall be etched in the Hall of Heroes! I've just finished my paperwork and I am going to hand it in right now.\" Izkrael reached into his bag and took out his character sheet. The guard took 10 at the paper.\n\n\"Alright, you may enter. The reception is straight ahead.\"\n\nAs Izkrael walked towards the reception, he saw many other creatures and races sitting together, talking with one another and having a good time. As he approached the reception, he was greeted by an old dwarf wearing glasses. \"Hello there! I'm Flint! I hope that Gordon the guardsman didn't give you so much trouble. How may I help you?\"\n\n\"I've come to get my adventurer's licence! Here is my paperwork!\" Izkrael handed his character sheet to Flint.\n\nThe old dwarf took 10, checked that the elf did not have an attribute lower than 7, checked that the numbers add up, recorded his wealth, wrote something on the sheet and then handed the sheet back to the elf. \"Yep. Looks good to me. You're now officially an adventurer!\"\n\n\"Wait! Don't I get anything to prove that I am an adventurer?\" \n\n\"Look at yourself carefully.\"\n\nIzkrael noticed that in his inventory he now has a Guild card.\n\n\"Sweet! Now I can go out and kill stuff!\"\n\n\"Not so fast!\" retorted Flint. \"You surely know the rules that you must follow? You cannot just go out and simply slay everything that moves!\"\n\n\"I know, I know. So what requests have you got for me?!\"\n\nFlint pulled up a binder and took a glance at the pages. They were blank. Uh oh. He must have misplaced his notes somewhere else. Then again, Flint never really wrote anything since he never expected anyone to do a quest. Flint tried his hardest to come up with anything that Izkrael could do. Then he remembered something.\n\n\"Ah! Here we are! This would be perfect for someone who is starting out. A dwarf fighter and a human wizard wants someone to perform a reconnaissance of a small village.\"\n\nIzkrael's spirit lowered. He wanted to slay large beasts and take down dragons, not perform such little tasks such as scouting. But he shrugged. After all, everyone has to start somewhere. \"All right. I'll do it. Where do I go?\"\n\n\"Hang on one moment. Let me perform a few things.\" Flint started writing down a few notes on his binder and opened some reference books to look at a few things to refresh his memory. \"Okay, simply follow those train tracks and you will meet your clients.\"\n\nAfter about a minute of following the train track he saw a dwarf and a human looking around. As they saw Izkrael approaching them while waving, they waved back.\n\n\"Well, helloo deere! Yoo mus' be the elf that took our request!\" The dwarf spoke with his thick North Mountain accent. \"I'm Rogan, an' this he-\"\n\n\"I'll introduce myself by myself, thanks\" interrupted the human. \"Greetings, elf. I am Gallus, a wizard who travels with my friend here. Now, what's your name?\"\n\n\"I am Izkrael.\"\n\n\"Izku, no. Izkeel. No.\" Rogan was finding it difficult to pronounce Izkrael's name. \"Bah! I'll call yoo Izzy! Elves and their names!\"\n\nGallus looked at Izkrael and shrugged. \"Oh well. Now that we have introduced themselves, let us be on our way.\" And so, the three people walked out of a gate of the city and went on their way towards their destination. ~~Following the train tracks.~~\n\nWhen they were a mile from their destination, they saw smoke in the direction that they were headed.\n\n\"That's not a good sign. Izkrael, find a place to scout where the smoke is coming from,\" commanded Gallus.\n\nIzkrael found a tall tree nearby. He climbed it up easily ~~because he is an elf~~ and used his Perception check. A natural 20. He saw a village with smoke on the rooftops, and a few humans going into the buildings. They were not wearing typical villager gear. ~~He also saw a group of halflings being dragged by large hulking armoured figures. The shields on the back of their armour were black with a white hand on top.~~\n\n\"What do ~~your elf eyes~~ you see?\" shouted Gallus.\n\n\"~~They're taking the halfings to the Iron Fortress!~~ The village has been attacked by bandits!\"\n\n\"We must hurry then! Quick! Let's go, Roga-\" Gallus paused as he saw his partner charging towards the village. \"Oh, not again!\"\n\nRogan ran towards the village as fast as his legs could go. ~~He was a dwarf so it wasn't really fast.~~ When he had arrived, Izzy and Gallus were a quarter of a mile away. \"Oi! Yoo lot better get oot of here or yoo'll suffer my wrath!\"\n\nThe 3 bandits in the village looked towards Rogan and walked out of the buildings. \"Get out of here! We're just \"recovering\" some supplies!\"\n\nRogan did not believe them and charged for a swing. He swung, but #1 was ready and managed to dodge the blow. #2 and #3 threw knives that managed to sink into Rogan's armour. Rogan was still standing. #1 got his longsword out  and just as he was about to swing, an arrow followed by an arcane bolt struck him down and he fell to the floor.\n\n\"You should really learn not to split up from the party, Rogan. Or else you get hurt like so.\" Gallus spoke after shooting the arcane bolt.\n\n\"There's more?!\" \" Let's scram!\" #2 and #3 looked at each other and ran towards the hills. Gallus and Izzy tried their best to take down the runners. #2 got shot in the back by an arrow from Izzy, but #3 managed to get away.Fortunately for the party, the last bandit left footprints so he was easily tracked towards a cave in a hill. As they approached the cave Rogan pointed out that he can see four bandits in the cave. As they were entering the cave, arrows flew out and Rogan got hit by one of them.\n\n\"Ow! Why yoo! RAAAAAAAAAAA!!\" Rogan ran into the cave to take a swing at the first bandit he saw. The bandit was not ready for such a direct attack and took a gruesome wound from the swing. He fell unconscious in one swing. Gallus stood outside the cave and , being a human, cannot see inside the cave and so he created a light source inside the cave to help him see. Izzy took a shot and he managed to rupture a major artery with a true strike. ~~There was no heart to pierce, since they're bandits.~~ The two remaining bandits dropped their weapons and held their hands up. Looking at what happened to their two comrades, they realised that they were no match for the party.\n\nAfter binding the two bandits with rope, they proceeded to ask questions. \"Why did you attack a village?!\" Rogan asked angrily.\n\n\"I don't know! We were just created to act as a bad guys in this scenario since the GM didn't plan anything in advance!\"\n\n\"... I know that feeling.\" Rogan responded.\n\nAt this point, the player was laughing for about a minute and it was getting late so I decided to summarise what happened afterwards.\n\nEpilogue of a prologue:\nThe bandits were detained but they swore that they did not pillage the village. They said that when they saw smoke in the village they thought they could wait until the culprits leave and then try and obtain a few scraps here and there. That was when Rogan came and fought with them. They did not know who the culprits are, but they did notice that they were riding horses.\n\nAfter that mission, Rogan and Gallus thanked Izzy and rewarded him with his pay. It was a good day. Looks like even small adventures could be fun!\n\nLooking at the time, Izzy decided to restock on his equipment and booked a room at an inn. What new challenges would tomorrow hold? Who will he meet? Will he become a legend?\n\nThe next morning, Izzy was woken up to the sound of horses, carts and wagons filled with boxes and barrels. He asked the innkeeper what is up with all of those wagons. The innkeeper said, \"Why simple! Everyone's getting supplies ready for next week's Dragon Ward festival!\"\n\nIzzy was shocked that he had forgotten about the Dragon Ward festival! He then smiled and ran towards the Adventurer's Guild. Flint was surrounded by a large group of adventurers and clients, jotting down as fast as he could. Looks like there is plenty of adventure to be had.\n\nThe End?",

        "text": "Where I left off last time, He Who Gets Shit Done had just used Banishing Smite (entirely ignoring the rules for how that spell actually works, but I didn't catch it in time and now it's canon) to send a miniboss to the realm of madness and super-daemons. Shortly afterwards, however, they heard the rumbling of giant footsteps approaching, signalling the arrival of the second miniboss: a giant motherfucker named Oleg and his three surviving minions.\n\nInitiative is rolled, first goes the fighter. He charges in and hits Oleg for some decent damage, sets him on fire. Then one of the minions attacks, hits the fighter for some light damage, and now the halfling monk (who is still invisible at this point after his previous stealthing) gets to go. Now, there are two things about this character which are important to note: when players create new characters in my group, I let them choose a minor magic item to have in their possession. This item is something they come up with and which I have to approve, but I figure since the party is so high-level, new people coming into the group at this point would have been adventuring long enough to have picked up something. The monk's was a pair of gnomish rocket boots- once a day, he can fire them off to get about 6-9 feet of vertical lift. Secondly, he is a were-goat. He made this choice when writing up his backstory because he thought it would be funny, and because our sorcerer is the King of the Goats and he hopes to one day seize his crown. I agreed that this would be funny and allowed it. Now, given this information, it makes sense that the monk wanted to headbutt Oleg in the dick.\n\nInvisible, he shifts into goat form and runs between the miniboss's legs. I have him roll Move Silently to determine if Oleg hears him running up to him, and the monk passes the roll. He stands beneath the giant's crotch and jumps, then activates the rocket boots. I pause. The group laughs. I sigh, and more laughter ensues. Monk asks me what damage he deals. That moment when you have to calculate rocket-powered dick-headbutt damage. Finally determine that it is the normal damage of his headbutt attack, doubled because it is a surprise attack, then that doubled because rocket boots. I also roll a D6 to determine by how many octaves his voice rises, unfortunately only getting a 1. Oleg is lifted into the air a few feet, then falls back down...with the goat horns still buried in his taint. I roll to see if he lands on his feet, and he fails. Lands on the goat, driving the monk further into his abdomen. At this point, it's time for the monk's second attack.\n\nGiven that his head and shoulders are now fully lodged in this fucker's lower body, the monk decides to start burrowing up. He rolls. He rolls well. Reaches the miniboss's heart and crushes that shit. I don't even think about damage, the son of a bitch just fucking dies. Minions are undead and bound to Oleg, so they dissolve into dust when he goes. Blood-and-gut-soaked weregoat bursts out of the dead fucker's chest like Alien and bleats in triumph.\n\nThat wasn't even the fucking end of it though. Afterwards the party goes searching the rest of the dungeon in search of the Big Boss, stumbles upon a storage room for magical minerals. There's shit tons, but the fighter wants to take it all. I inform him that he can't fucking do that, so he says \"I roll to know what's valuable.\" Natural 20. Confirm?\n\nAnother 20. One more time for shits and giggles?\n\n20.\n\nOH BABY A TRIPLE...AGAIN. Motherfucking madness, panic at the D&amp;Disco. Everyone loses their shit so thoroughly that a thousand bloodhounds could not find it again. Incidentally, this is also around the time the fighter discovers that his pockets are full of shit, which the halfling had previously reverse-pickpocketed in there after discovering the latrine. That aside, however, I had to come up with a way to handle the second triple 20 I had witnessed in my history of tabletop gaming. Going with the exact wording of his roll, I decide that the fighter has become a Master Appraiser, capable of knowing the exact value of anything on sight. In addition, he can tell if something is magical on sight and, if so, what its exact magical properties are. Finally, he can tell what value a given object will have to Bazzracath, my setting's friendly neighborhood bargain demon. He is so fucking smug about this shit, I doubt he would have been more pleased with himself if he'd been receiving a blow job as he rolled the dice. But I suppose he has every right to be. He won, definitely going to be no negative consequences for this at all...\n\nThis isn't even the end of that fucking session, so be on the lookout for Part 3 soon.",

The only room left in the house was the partial second floor, but there were no stairs.  The only way the party could see was to go back outside, go around the outer deck surrounding the first floor, and climb on to the roof of the first floor, which would give them access to a second floor door and window.\n\nReta eagerly climbs up and turns to help pull the others up with some rope, but leaving Squealy Nord to wait below.  That done, the four goblins pull up their final passenger, Guffy, up by her “leash”.  As they’re just completing the task, the party hears the subtle whistling of a wooden shaft piercing its way through the air, and a javelin suddenly appears protruding from Poog’s abdomen.  The rest of them turn to the second floor that they had neglected to check, and there was Pa Munchmeat, eyes filled with rage at seeing the condition of his daughter.\n\nOut of instinctive reflex, Mogmurch throws the first thing he can grab at the ogre, only it’s not a bomb.  Instead, it’s the bead of force he had picked up earlier.  The bead explodes on impact with Munchmeat and does massive damage to everything in a 10 foot radius.  The goblins themselves luckily were just outside this radius, and avoid any damage themselves besides the odd piece of wood from the explosion of force bouncing off their bodies.\n\nAs the dust began to settle, the party waited eagerly to see if they had already accomplished their goal and killed the horrible ogre.  Well, three of them did.  Poog was still screaming over the sudden introduction of a javelin to his insides.  Once the dust clears enough to see, the bead’s secondary effect is revealed: Everything damaged by the explosion of force is now trapped in an impenetrable shield except to allow those inside to breathe, and Pa Munchmeat was indeed still breathing.\n\nOnce all five of them understood the stalemate that their battle had so swiftly become, both sides quickly began preparations, not knowing how long it would last.  Pa Munchmeat immediately began healing himself of the damage the bead of force had dealt, while the goblins removed the javelin from Poog and he too healed himself.  \n\nNow seeking revenge, Poog began to form a plan, and the other goblins were eager to listen with the promise of more explosions.  After Poog explains, the goblins part, and Reta distracts Munchmeat by flamboyantly dancing with the blind, quadriplegic body of his daughter, Guffy.  Pa Munchmeat becomes enraged, and doesn’t notice as Chuffy disappears by drinking a potion of invisibility.  Poog meanwhile finishes his plans with Mogmurch and they prepare for the shield to drop.\n\nThe shield stays up for 10 minutes, after which the ogre opens the battle by summoning a swarm of bats.  The swarm isn’t enough to break line of sight though, and the plan comes together with the following hitting Pa Munchmeat:\n\n* A spiritual weapon summoned by Poog the previous round to the back\n* 3 Alchemist’s Fires and the Necklace of Fireball all tied together and thrown by Mogmurch, unleashing three massive fireballs on impact from the necklace on top of the massive amount of alchemical fire.\n* Poog casting Channel Negative Energy\n* A surprise bow attack from the invisible Chuffy with a poison-tipped arrow\n* A normal bow attack from Reta for good measure\n\nThrough the power of this sudden onslaught, Pa Munchmeat staggers, tries to remain conscious, and fails.  His body tumbles backwards into the pile of wood that is the center of his house now, and the swarm of bat is swiftly taken care of.  The goblins have won.\n\nAs the rest of the party jumps and yells in celebration, Reta runs up to the ogre’s body, and rips out his heart and eats it before bathing her owlbear egg in his blood.  The jubilation continues as the party storms into what’s left of Munchmeat’s room to see what loot can be had.  Inside, they find a badly taxidermied dire corby.  They decide to rip the claws from the corpsified corby, and Mogmurch runs back to Squealy Nord to glue the claws onto his back to give him spikes.\n\nOther than that, the only other thing of interest that the party finds is a sack of straw, which they eagerly rip apart.  As they do, Chuffy notices the brief glint of metal, and miraculously manages to pluck a single golden needle from the pile.  He shouts with joy, and runs after Mogmurch to glue it on to Squealy Nord’s forehead like a charm.  As the group gathers back around the pig, they look at the total of their handiwork and decide to rename him to Spiky Nord.\n\nHaving completed their herculean task, the party begins the trip back to the Birdcruncher tribe with their new piggy mascot, and with Reta still dragging Guffy along.  Once they return, the entire tribe comes out to witness the returning heroes.  Reta announces that Pa Munchmeat is dead, and the tribe erupts with ecstatic joy, jumping and screaming and yelling to hear the full story.  \n\nBefore Reta will continue; however, she says that she has one more announcement.  Reta props Guffy up against a nearby thick stick, and proclaims that this is the tribe’s new oracle.  Sending the nearest goblin off to fetch some tea leaves, she gets ready to demonstrate how this oracle will work.  Upon the goblins return, Reta shoves the tea leaves into the finally conscious Guffy’s mouth, then forces her to chew for a bit before Guffy spits them back out.  Reta then “reads” the spit up leaves, and announces that the future is bright and ogre-less for the Birdcruncher tribe.  The tribe bursts into jubilation once again, and hail their new chief and three sub-chiefs.\n\nA few days into her reign, Reta reveals another way that Guffy can act as an oracle.  She stands a giant piece of wood in front of Guffy, and force feeds her one of the many gourds of fire burping they now have.  Guffy then breathes fire onto the wood, and Reta “reads” the burn marks.  After a brief pause, Reta announces to the tribe that it’s time to go burn something down, and they all go on a gleeful raid to the nearest human settlement with their new heroic leaders leading the way.",

        "text": "Another several-part series, because the most recent session of The Glorious Chucklefucks produced enough material, once again, for a fuckload of tales all on its own. Every time these dickheads pull off some crazy bullshit, I worry that we won't be able to top it. Every time I put a challenge in front of them, harder than the one before it, I worry that they won't be able to cheese through it effortlessly. But then, this shit happens.\n\nSession begins with the party opening a door and encountering the big boss of the dungeon. The boss is wearing an amulet which produces an unlimited amount of Aether (raw magical power produced by living souls in my homebrew setting), essentially granting the big boss infinite power. This entitles him to press The Win Button and immobilize the party immediately, at which point he begins to villain monologue. Before he can begin enthralling the PCs, however, his trusty lieutenant appears and whispers something to him. Vowing to deal with the PCs later, he disarms and locks them away in his dungeon before teleporting to parts unknown. The group escapes by way of two lycanthropes and a Performance check, and in searching the dungeon encounters a halfling monk, AKA the new character of Vice Blackbard's former player. He joins the party, and the group moves on after dropping their non-functioning Warforged companion into the paladin's extradimensional storage space (his player was absent that day).\n\nAfter a bit of exploring, the party discovers the barracks were the big boss's thralls are housed. There's about a dozen of them in the room, asleep, with a miniboss at the end opposite the PCs. The dumbass fighter wants to charge in and fight them all, but the monk informs them that he has a plan. Because Way of the Shadow monks are fucking broken, this guy gets to turn invisible and stride into the room, making no noise as a halfling with high dexterity. I assume he's going to punch them all in the throat (six times) in their sleep, but no. He goes up to the first door in the room other than the one through which they entered and checks it for traps. There is a trap, designed to deal damage and seal the door if the lock on the door is broken or picked, and he tampers with it so that it will go off regardless of whether a key is used. Then he goes to the next door and discovers it to be untrapped, to which he responds by rigging it with a trap he'd disarmed on a previous door, a small explosive. Finally he goes to the last door in the room, which is armed with a spike trap of some sort, and rigs that similarly to the way he rigged the first, then withdraws from the room. He moves a table in front of the door through which he entered, then has the fighter use his spooky Eldritch Knight bullshit to cast Fire Bolt into the room.\n\nWell I'll be fucked. The fire catches and quickly spreads to the wooden bunk beds. The fearless undead thralls calmly get up and begin to fight the fire, but they make a series of shit rolls and fail to contain it. As the blaze spreads, the miniboss orders his thralls to fall back from the room...through the first door, wounding the bastard who tries to open it before sealing itself. Again, they roll to fight the fire. Again, they fail. Access to the third door is cut off by the expanding inferno, so the thralls flee toward the second, positioned in the back of the room. The explosive catches the miniboss square in the face when he tries to open it, knocking him back and sending two of his goons careening into the flames. The two thralls die, but those remaining manage to bust through the damaged door into the study beyond, where two guards help them fight back and finally contain the fire. That is, until the Eldritch fighter uses Gust of Wind. \n\nButwaitthere'smore.avi.\n\nFlames get blasted into the next room full of books and motherfuckers who think they're safe. Guards and all but three of the thralls get incinerated, miniboss takes his remaining goons and flees to a stone room with nothing flammable in it. After a few more turns, the PCs hear what sounds like an arctic wind in the burning room beyond, and the flames start to recede. The group sneaks around to find the lieutenant fellow from earlier, entirely preoccupied by attempting to magically extinguish the inferno. Had he rolled better, his spell would have successfully put it out in time for him to notice the PCs sneaking up on him. As it was, however, the paladin shot him with a blunderbuss and then attacked with his sword, using Banishing Smite. The guy (set up as another miniboss, by the way) rolled horribly on his save and was banished, as laid out by the description of Banishing Smite, to an alternate dimension of the paladin's choice. He chose the Warp, Warhammer 40K's realm of madness and super demons (of which his character was, actually, aware due to some convoluted shit), which essentially meant that that miniboss was fucking dead. In one attack.\n\nFuck.\n\nThe players' celebration was short-lived, however, as they soon heard a great rumbling shaking the chamber around them. It quickly became apparent that the rumbling was being caused by the running footsteps of the other miniboss, a motherfucking giant of a man, fast approaching. They cheesed him too, but that is another story...",

        "text": "Before I begin my tale I should introduce the characters,\n-The Half-Orc paladin, Vay Hek (He's a big fan of warframe)\n-The Goblin Alchemist, I can't remember his name\n-The Tengu Samurai, Kerroe\n-The Sylph Rogue, Connery the jack-ass (Not his actual title)\n-And finally a Dhampir Gunslinger named Grimross\n-All of them were neutral, or supposed to be anyways.\n\n This was my first time being GM and the party's first time playing an RPG so don't judge to harshly. Anyways,The party started out as mercenaries hired by the kingdom to explore the new world, along with a hundred other sell-swords. Of course when they near the newly discovered continent a storm hits and the ship crashes. They all awaken on a beach to behold a band of Lizardmen clubbing the survivors like baby seals and taking their belongings. I should probably mention the symbiotic relationship between two of the players before I continue. Vay Hek was a dirt stupid paladin, he was so dumb in fact that he had negatives to his Religion rolls. A paladin so dumb, he barely knew anything of his god, other than the fact that he was a god. So to make up for his lack of intelligence, The Goblin decided to take advantage of the Half-Orc's brawn. The goblin's AC was complete trash and his HP was worse off, so the goblin lived in a Treasure chest on Vay Hek's back. The Goblin was the mind, Vay Hek was the body and together they made Master Blaster. So the party wakes up along the wreckage and we roll up initiative. It was a pretty smooth fight, Kerroe was slicing through Lizardmen like they were made of paper and Grimross was blasting heads off left and right. Vay Hek charged a party of three and began tanking damage while the Goblin on his back was chucking Alchemist's fire into the Lizardmen's ranks. The damage caught up with Vay Hek however and he was becoming dangerously low. The Lizardman was almost full health and Vay Hek was almost dead, and if he died, the Goblin was dead too. Vay Hek rolled his final attack and of course got a natural 20. His warhammer whistled through the air and taco'd the Lizardman's head apart. The party triumphed with Connery doing absolutely nothing in the fight what so ever. The party headed off the beach and ran into a scout party lead by an important NPC named Taggert. Taggert was a drunken, bald, horribly scarred, and bearded man that the party pissed off to no end because they thought he was a werewolf and wanted him to turn to prove them right. That wasn't the case but I let them think it anyways. After the meet-up they headed to Taggert's camp and accepted Taggert's job offer. They were to check out a jungle temple that was causing his scouts a load of trouble and see what was irritating the local ape population. That night however, they partied hard with scout team's alcohol and women. Connery got so wasted in fact that he relieved himself, in every way possible, on the Goblin's treasure chest and fell asleep in a tree on the outskirts of the camp. The Goblin was understandably angry and decided to use his alchemist skills to whip up some drugs using the ingredients he found near the camp. The concoction was a vile batch of some bojack ass LSD and since he didn't know who desecrated his treasure chest, he used it on the whole party. When they woke up, they were out of their damn minds. Butt-naked and going apeshit in Taggert's camp. When Taggert caught them violating equipment he punched out the entire party and let them sleep off the drugs before they headed out on their quest. That was Taggert's strike one.\n\nIf anyone is interested in the continuation of the story I will gladly post part 2.",

        "text": "Last night's session went differently than I expected to say the least and included a player death to boot.\n\nPathfinder with a Homebrew setting and the only relevant details you need to know are that the party is a scratch team put together by nobles trying to win fame for themselves by impressing a King.  The party patron has a family full of useless mouths, idiots, inbreds and incompetents.  In desperation he builds a party to represent his house out of a Disgraced human Noble (Rogue), a disturbed human child and runaway slave (Witch) a Kitsune Gunslinger (Who's minor nobility in her own right) and a Catfolk Monk (Who has a last survivor of her tradition angle going).  Aside from the harem jokes about the Rogue being the only male in a party with a Kungfu Catgirl, a shapeshifting pistol girl and Sadako from the Ring the party has done well enough for now despite the Rogue having to cover for the rest of the party.\n\n\nMinor plot point is that this homebrew world is modeled on one where parties of adventures are a historical fact and their effect can be seen on both culture and tradition.  Thus a \"High King\" who united an entire continent under his rule by his own strength and his four companions.  The session starts with the party descending into the unlooted tomb of one of said companions (Who's modeled on generic murder hobo some players enjoy playing as, all combat and not a social or secondary skill to be found).\n\nThe tomb in question is directly under the Companions old house/fort that their patron was to taken.   Having cleared the Fort they naturally want to check out this Tomb after clearing out the constructs and clockwork soldiers who were defending the fort itself.  After clearing the last of the constructs they go into the tomb proper and things start going pear shaped.\n\nI had set up a specific challenge in mind with designing this tomb.  A combination of obvious dire warning glyphs, very easy to find traps and very hard to see traps that could be a nasty surprise combined with lots of twists, turns and a dividing set of paths all of which lead to the tomb chamber itself.   The warnings all threaten punishment to those who would defile the Companions body. One path said \"We will defend him\" the other said \"I will defend him\". Right away things start going south as they read the warnings and decide to split up. \n\nThankfully I had tossed in some backup features like helpful NPC's and a DMNPC who existed to be their second chance skill monkey or handle negotiations if they did not want to be arsed to do so during one session with the understanding said DMNPC was greedy, shortsighted and ignored things like \"Do not open\" or \"No not push\" making him a double edged sword.  But instead of using any of said NPC they decided the Gunslinger would go down one path while the Monk walked the other.\n\nThey had an easy time of it since the traps that were easy to see were not that damaging but all designed to slow someone down.  The hard to see traps were all also seen as they were mostly false floor pit traps but their damage was nothing to sneeze at... but the Monk saw every single one.  And both paths meet up, the Gunslinger and the Monk are studying the entrance to the tomb chamber which has a permanent darkness cast across it and a giant spell glyph traced across every inch of the floor, walls and ceiling directly across from the darkness covered entrance.  \n\nSeeing the very obvious trap the two decided to go back and get the Witch so she can study the trap and see if she can bypass it (The DC is nuts so only a 20 would have done it and missing it by 10 or more would have set it off, so 5% chance to break it, 50% chance to set it off it was designed to be nasty)\n\nNaturally the Rogue is busy schmoozing with the NPC's talking about bars he and the NPC's have visited in the capital, I'm enjoying RPing this out on the side but they are still waiting in the entrance because for some reason the two of them only grab the witch and not the Rogue or the accompning NPC's, maybe they wanted loot who knows... I already told them that taking anything out of here was the equivalent of robbing Mikhail Kalashnikov tomb, it would not earn them any love anywhere.  Even the it \"belongs in a museum\" argument would not fly if they tried taking the Companions personal items.\n\nSkipping a few things of RP the Witch screws it up on her second try and triggers the (Summoning) trap and now the real trap becomes evident.  As several positive energy elemental are summoned bellowing that the party would not defile the Companions body.  These things were great as they hit for 9-20 damage per hit VS 2nd level characters but said damage was positive energy meaning it healed them.  But along with that damage the hits tended to toss people like rag dolls dealing Impact (House roled as falling damage) of 1d10 or 2d10 depending on how much room there is for someone to fly back after being punched.\n\nSo the fight is on and it's what I expected, the players are like \"Oh I got healed for 5?  And it's temporary hit points? Nice!  Then I drop the temporary hitpoints positive energy rules.  Specifically if your healed to twice your max total HP you must make a DC fortitude saving throw or explode in a burst of positive energy... and die.  These Positive energy elemental were meant to ruin the day of any undead who tried to defile the body of the Companion and have a AOE blind, an AOE slam (No movement) and a grab attack channel energy for 4d6 and again as these are 2nd level characters they are in a bad spot.\n\nThe witch books it first and gets a decent distance away while the Gunslinger is saving or dieing.  The Witch's familiar successfully summons the Rogue and his NPC backup to fight one by an excellent Lassie imitation.  The way back is winding and the Positive Energy elemental can phase through the tomb walls at will so the party is constantly getting cut off and being punched around, triggering opportunity attacks as the large creatures fill entire hallways.  \n\nThen our player death occures as the Witch fails to notice a trap the monk saw and jumped and gets 2d10 of pit trap + roof falling in after her.  And between being a witch, having a con hit and not getting hit often in the fight she gets her entire HP bar gone in one hit as I role max damage and drops her so far into the negatives she's going to bleed out in two turns.  As she's the healer the four stabilization attempts tried all fail.  They need a 15 and they give me an 4,6,9,11 and none of it is good enough and she dies.\n\nBut the fight is still ongoing and while the Gunslinger, Witch and Monk have been Scooby do run away from these things the Rogue and his two NPC backup have chewed through the other one, none of them get close enough to exploding because my rolls are terrible and their rolls are amazing, this fight featured FOUR crits on their side including two crits from thrown weapons (One of which was a Battleaxe, the other a shoe) and when the blinding attack goes off they all mostly attack each other that round eating away at the temporary hitpoints only to finish it off the next turn.\n\nCombat is pretty much over at this point, both of the NPC's who entered the fight are healed up as is the Rogue, the witch is dead the Gunslinger threw her gun rather than reload it and the Monk spent the rest of the battle running away with the Witch's body only to trigger yet more traps as a corpse was dragging through the wards all designed to prevent the Companions body from being removed.\n\nWe ended the session with the last positive energy elemental being poofed and the living all leveled as a result but I had thought bad party tactics were going to result in a TPK.  Still while the fight went the way I had imagined it it was fun to start tossing tokens around and watching players freak out as that secondary HP climbed to max.  I had planned this to be a race away from the Positive Energy Elementals as they jumped over or set off traps as they were alternatively punched or blinded as they tried to escape the maze like corridors of the tomb.  Instead the Rogue figured he could take them with his backup while the other three alternated between fighting and running away.  All in all it was interesting and the concept worked.  I have another group I DM I think I'll try the concept in a different form in just a few months.\n\nI know two of them read Gametales so I don't elaborate further.  :)   \n\n\n",

        "text": "[A track map of the Monaco F1 circuit for reference.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Circuit_Monaco.png)\n\nIn the wet qualifying session after two dry practice sessions (where I ran mid-field), I could *not* get my Minardi set up properly, and ended up dead last.\n\nThe race was dry thankfully, so I figured I was in with a shot at some points.\n\nI normally aim for a one-stop race at Monaco, where track position is king, but I decided on a two stop, hoping a lighter fuel load could get me some places early on.\n\nBy my first stop on lap 22, I was up into 12th; I was hoping to be higher, but one of the Williams cars had dropped through the field early and I couldn't get past him.\n\nAfter the stop I was only back to 16th which was good, and caught back up to the main pack in four or five laps.\n\nA bit more pottering around ensued, until the cars that were one-stopping started coming around lap 36.\n\nI got enough free air that, when the leader (Barrichello) stopped, he came out only a second or two in front, and there was clear air between me and him, though I had to watch Coulthard's McLaren in my mirrors.\n\nAnd I put my foot down.\n\nI caught Barrichello after a lap, and passed him through turn 3.\n\nHe was slowed down by our fight sufficiently that Coulthard ended up all over him, and this allowed me to build a buffer of ~10 seconds by my second stop around lap 50.\n\nI was starting to get excited.\n\nOn fresh tyres, I made my way up from 4th to be on Barrichello again by lap 58, and passed him by lap 60.\n\nI threw down fastest laps - all about two-tenths faster than Barrichello's best, - and had got about 12 seconds by lap 70.\n\nThen I got a puncture coming out of the tunnel.\n\nPutting it mildly, there are better places to get a puncture.\n\nHit the brakes for the chicane, locking up something fierce and sliding around.\n\nI pushed far harder than I knew was sensible, and managed to still have a lead of ~7 seconds when I got back to the pits.\n\nThe entire time I was flicking an eye to the minimap, and saw the two icons representing Barrichello and Coulthard come to a stop through Rascasse.\n\nThere wasn't any damage apparently because they both started moving, but it had cost them a handful a seconds.\n\nI came out of the pits in 6th place, with 8 laps to go, 16 seconds off the leaders.\n\nTwo seconds a lap, with traffic to contend with.\n\nAt the start of the race, I would have been content with 6th.\n\nBut not now.\n\nI'd driven pretty damn well the whole race, and I wanted to win.\n\nFirst car up was the Jordan of Jean Aleisi; Passed him through the tunnel after he got a poor exit out Portier, and my fresh tyres paid for themselves.\n\nEnd of 71, I was 5th and 15 seconds off the leaders.\n\nNot fast enough.\n\nOn lap 72, I got Montoya through Massenet.\n\nPushing beyond where I thought the limit was, I made some good time.\n\nEnd of 72, I was 4th, 12 seconds off the leaders.\n\nHäkkinen was next up......9 seconds down the road.\n\nOver the next three laps, I took full advantage of my tyres, and was on Häkkinen's gearbox at the start of lap 76.\n\nA quick pass at turn 1, and I was third, with free air.\n\nAt the start of lap 77, I was on Coulthard, who was, in turn, on Barrichello.\n\nCoulthard and I ran two wide all the way between turn 1 and turn 5.\n\nI got better drive out of 5, took up the line for the hairpin, and Coulthard dived up the inside, all locked up.\n\nHe hit the wall hard, and bounced back, missing my car I don't even know how.\n\nOur scuffle had given Barrichello a lead of 2 seconds, but he lost time through the swimming pool section and I was on him through Rascasse.\n\nFinal lap, nobody behind us, no traffic in front.\n\nIt was on.\n\nWe traded places at nearly every turn, with him leading again with a dive at the Nouvelle Chicane.\n\nWe flew through 13 and 14, both of us sliding something fierce, and were side by side through 15 and 16.\n\nAgain, I reminded myself that, at the start of the race, finishing this high up was a fantasy; I could settle for 2nd, and hold my head high.\n\nBut I didn't care.\n\nWe were side by side when we hit the brakes for Rascasse for the last time.\n\nWe both locked up, and started modulating the brakes to avoid the wall.\n\nThe intensity of the last few laps had ruined both of our tyre sets.\n\nBut his were more ruined.\n\nHe was still locked up as we got to the turn in point, and his back end wobbled.\n\nNot much, but enough.\n\nI saw the hesitation and the second bite of the wheel, and threw the car in there.\n\nIf I don't know how Coulthard's car missed me earlier, then I doubly don't know how I made the gap here.\n\nI was out of position for the short run to 18, and Barrichello had recovered enough to be right on me as we hit the little kink that was 19.\n\n(Which is not labelled on that map strangely.)\n\nBut I was still ahead.\n\nMy finish time: 1:48:25.781\n\nBarrichello: 1:48:25.791",

        "text": "Earlier today, a scheduled game wasn't going to be able to be run due to absences, so I offered to run a D&amp;D 5E one shot that had been in the back of my mind for a while.\n\nIt ended up only being two players, whose characters didn't strike me as amazing at first. Both of them were Level 4.\n\nAnkar, the Human Ranger, with pretty OP ability scores and a pet Giant Wolf Spider. This is great for me since I have horrific arachnophobia, which he found out shortly after we began.\n\nThe other character was Jaet (I figured out it was pronounced \"Jet\" or something along those lines), who was, while not a powerful character, an interesting character. Jaet was a Human Monk, but the most important thing is that he's blind. Yeah, I know. With certain feats and 18 wisdom, his Passive Perception was *21*. Basically Daredevil.\n\nAnyways, this couple found themselves awaking in a dark cell, chained to the wall, alongside the people of a caravan they were travelling with. After breaking free and killing/incapacitating three fully armed  drow guards with a chain and a piton, without taking any hits, they interrogated one, and discovered where the armoury was.\n\nUpon promising not to kill the drow, and then slitting his throat, they followed his directions to the armoury, only to find the Warden's office. A few rounds of combat later, and the Warden is face down on the floor with a spider nibbling at his throat. *Eesh.*\n\nThe party continued searching around, and freed the fellow captives, as well as the people's pets and children, also recovering their equipment in the process.\n\nEventually they came to a double door leading into a large corridor stretching left and right. Ankar spots a woman rounding a corner, and they decide to follow. *Roll stealth checks.* Ankar gets an 18, Jaet... natural 1. His axe screeches along the metal siding of the door as he passes it and the sound echoes down the corridor. Both of them freeze, and a few moments later seemingly the same drow woman, flanked by two guards of the same race, round the corner. *Roll initiative.*\n\nThey soon discovered she was a high level spellcaster, and after some rounds of combat were slightly panicking. Ankar was shooting from afar, and Jaet was up close. As Jaet turned to flee, he was hit in the back by magic missile, and fell, unconscious. Seconds later Ankar was hit by a crossbow bolt and went down too.\n\nCue mass salt. Mostly from Ankar's player. The salt was mostly from the fact that the spellcaster was a way higher level than them, but I genuinely hadn't expected them to encounter her in combat so suddenly, and so they got destroyed pretty quick.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes of silence and slight talk, I say:\n\n\"Well roll your death saves anyway, just to see.\"\n\n\"Why? It's not like the drow will let us live.\"\n\n\"Just go on.\"\n\nJaet gets 2 fails and 3 successes; stable.\n\n*Ankar gets a natural 20.*\n\nIn awe, I tell him that the approaching guard has just reached him, and the other guard and mage have not noticed his return to the world. *Roll to hit.* In one hit, he kills the guard. The other two, about to finish off Jaet, now turn to Ankar, who is on 1 hit point. The guard begins to come over, but has to dash. The mage hits Ankar, and he goes down again.\n\n\"Roll your death save, you have a turn before the guard gets there.\"\n\n*Natural 20.*\n\nThe guard misses on his turn, as does the mage, who is now coming over.\n\nAnkar rolls to hit. One hit kill on the other guard, exactly the amount of damage he needed. He has another attack, uses it to throw a dagger at the mage. Hit, pretty good damage.\n\nThe mage misses another spell, and is still moving towards him. He begins to retreat, and over the course of the next two rounds they both miss twice. Then, he hits.\n\n*My god does he hit.*\n\nAnd he kills her.\n\nAnd we're all sitting there, not able to believe this.\n\nThe Level 4 PC with 1 HP managed to kill the Level 9 Wizard with almost full health.\n\nThe ONLY thing that I think can be said at this point, [is](https://i.imgur.com/dgBojcq.jpg)",

        "text": "So my first long-running character was a Divine Gorilla in Gamma World. It was decided that he was a gorilla sent into space during the 60's who gained god-like abilities due to space radiation (as you do).\n\nI named him Gordon and he was the first character I really developed. Nothing serious, but he was enough of a party-favorite that the DM put in a Deus ex Machina that resurrected him after a memorable encounter. Gordon was known for boasting, saying things like \"GORDON HAS F*CKED A MOON!,\" but was actually relatively weak compared to the rest of the party.\n\nAnyway, I brought my friend in the campaign and it was his first experience with RPG's. He made a time-distorting ratman for his character. I can't recall the name. \n\nHe was cautious, as we all are when we first start playing, but eventually found the character. Things were going great.\n\nUntil combat started.\n\nWe were surrounded by giant birds and dog-men. I can't recall if I suggested it or if he took the initiative, but he elected to use his Alpha Mutation: Self-Destruct.\n\nAn Alpha Mutation is a random power assigned to a player at the beginning of the game and swapped out whenever there is a critical fail or other event that causes reality to warp.\n\nThis would have been fine, if he had read the rules for the power, which stated that all *beings* caught in the radius would be harmed, not all *enemies* as we had assumed.\n\nThe blast did more than enough damage to take Gordon out permanently. The DM thought it was hilarious (and in retrospect, it was) so this death stuck. \n\nMy friend apologized profusely and the rest of the party mourned. I rolled a new character (A plauge carrier with black holes instead for boils. I called him Star Pox) but no one has ever lived up to Gordon.\n\nThat friend and I are still friends. We still enjoy RPG's. But I love to remind him of this story every chance I get.",

        "text": "I'm very glad to be off of the road and back in Malamar. We traveled through a storm to get here today so Calorossa can pick up the plate armor she ordered. \n\nAs for myself, I'm rather irritated. The fort King Aias sent us to reclaim was overrun by people. They were outlaws, but not bad people. At odds with the notion of the royal crown of Aramal, but not with any specific king. Their grievances had long roots. Centuries long. I don't know how to fix such prejudices. \n\nWe might have been able to chase them off, but there was no justification for it. \n\nThe fort was falling apart, anyway. It would have been months of work with lots of hired help to get it up to even my lowest standards.\n\nPerhaps that old dwarven outpost we found would make a better base of operations. \n\nMy soggy boots are not helping my mood. Time to dry off and make our plans. That message Calorossa received from her deity, Levias, was most worrisome. The quest for The Procellen Eye has had it's priority upgraded. We leave for the dwarven city of Orfarleega as soon as possible. \n---\n\nOrianna went off to to get Thalen scrubbed and clothed. He really seemed to ... embrace the wilderness. Juniper, Avea, and I are accompanying Calorossa to check up on her armor. \n----\n\nI've learned that Maramal has an interesting tradition. Any time there is a large summer storm they hold a tourny in the wind, rain, and thunder. \n\nCalorossa has decided to buy a horse and enter a few of the events. Thalen and Avea will likely enter some as well.\n---- \n\nThe three of them entered the king of the hill finale as a team. Orianna, Juniper, and I are sitting this one out. I've had enough personal excitement the past week. Time to let someone else risk their neck for my amusement. \n\n----\n\nMy companions all saw great victories through their feats of strength and dexterity, which I'll write about in more detail later. \n\nI wish I could revel longer in the joy of my companions victories, but this stormy night has taken a terrible turn.\n\nWhile we were enjoying ourselves participating in and betting on the tourny, the king approached me, rather poorly disguised. We discussed his daughter, who was participating in a couple of the events. \n\nAs I watched the events Orianna noticed some suspicious fellows sitting silently together. They were making weird hand gestures. She assumed that these were some sort of discreet communication. \n\nShe brought me over to get my assessment of the men. We decided that a distraction was needed to see what they're up to. I pushed Orianna and she landed in the lap of the man seated in the center. She managed to swipe the contents of his pocket before making her exit. \n\nA piccolo, a map of the tourny grounds, and a ring. \n\nWhile we waited for the king of the hill event to be set up, I investigated the items Orianna acquired. \n\nThe piccolo seemed normal, but was much louder than expected when I blew into it. \n\nThe ring was magical, and produces a modest light when the keyword, Azul, is spoken. \n\nThe map was most interesting, and most worrisome. At first, I saw nothing but the layout of the grounds. Upon closer inspection I noticed something else was hidden. Holding it up to the light I saw fuzzy markings. Using the ring to illuminate the map revealed notes about guard placements and the king's disguise. \n\nI rush to find the king just as the last event is starting. I tell him that he is in danger. I suggest he leaves, but he'll have none of it. \"I trust you to keep me safe.\" I hesitate, but sit with him. \n\nAs the event begins I notice one of the groups is the three men Orianna bumped into and stole the map from. The event begins and one of them runs to the hill, pulls an un-blunted arrow from his quiver and shouts, \"Long live the king!\" \n\nHe looses his arrow. I jump to block the missile with my own body. I fail and the arrow finds the king's neck. \n\nThalen and Avea kill one of the three men, then subdue the other two, including the would be assassin. Calorossa rushes to the king at my urging. She is blocked by several people in the crowd, but makes it time to revive the king with her divine magicks. \n\nWe rush the king back to his castle and retire for now. This knife of tragedy cut too close tonight. I hope to interrogate the man responsible tomorrow. \n\nWhy does it always seem that something like this happens just as we're about to go looking for The Eye in earnest? \n----\nPart 1 -- END",

        "text": "SO IT BEGINS:\nJoining us for this tale will be Martin Luter the halfing Bard, Ethac the Bearded the human Wizard, Elfred the elven Ranger, and Abbey Redriver the halfing Rogue. They don't know that yet though...\n\nThe party awakes in a field, lying on their backs.They have no recollection of who they are, why they are here, or who these other strangers are.\n\nThey are lying around a lit campfire. There is light projecting from the location of the campfire, out to 20 feet. After that point there is only darkness, and there are no stars or moon in the sky.\n\nThey immediately start arguing with each other.\nThe wizard does a spot check and discovers two large crystals embedded in the ground (the wizard does not yet realise that they are large, or that they are embedded in the ground). There is a blue pyrimidal crystal, and a red trapezoidal crystal.\n\nThe wizard decides to keep this information to himself for now, after discovering that he cannot steal the crystals and put them in his pockets.\n\nThere is still an ongoing argument.\n\nThe rogue suggests that the party investigate the crystals (we're not very good with in character/out of character separation right now).\n\nThe wizard casts Light on his hat.\n\nThe light does not help penetrate the surrounding darkness, but the crystals reflect the magic light in an unusual and plot advancing way.\n\nThe wizard does an arcana knowledge check, and discovers that the blue crystal will (somehow) lead them upwards, and the red crystal will lead them downwards.\n\nThe wizard puts his hat on the blue crystal.\n\nA rope descends out of the darkness.\n\nThe wizard climbs onto the rope and does not inform the party of this new development.\n\nThe wizard removes his (light enchanted) hat from the blue crystal, and the rope disappears. The wizard does not fall far enough to roll for falling damage. The party is now suggesting things to do with the hat and the blue and red crystal (like I said, we're not so good at keeping player knowledge and character knowledge separate) and the hat ends up on the red crystal.\n\nThe fire goes out, and the ground in the middle melts away to reveal a torch lit spiral stairway downwards.\n\nThe hat is almost immediately removed from the red crystal, and placed back on the blue crystal. There is some more arguing.\n\nEveryone climbs onto the rope successfully, and the last one on removes the hat from the crystal. The ground and the fire disappear.\n\nThe party begins passing the hat up and down the rope to each other looking for things. They see nothing but the rope and each other. They notice that they hear a large bat-like creature flying around them and begin to climb very fast. This does not improve the situation.\n\nThere is some debate about what to do about the bat-like creature, and they decide to climb down. The rope becomes slippery.\n\nElfred (the elven ranger) decides that this is a good time to bite the rope. The rope disappears.\nEveryone begins falling, and regains their equipment and memories.\nThey land (safely!) In the elemental plane of thought, because I am the DM and I say there's an elemental plane of thought, and that is that.\n\nEthac the wizard does a planes knowledge check, discovers this, and decides to keep this information to himself.\n\nThey look around and discover that they are standing in a thought field near a thought steam and there are some thought hills and thought mountains in the distance. Thought thought thought.\n\nEthac tries to imagine a way home, but fails his concentration check. The party goes to the stream and they fill their water skins and flasks. Elfred decides it's a good idea to dump some of the thought steam water on Martin Luter's guard dog. \n\nThe dog begins to glow, but is not a light source.\n\nLike a good scientist, Elfred splashes the rest of the thought river water on Martin Luter's lute, just to see if the effects will repeat themselves. Martin Luter's lute begins to glow, but is also not a light source. Elfred asks Martin to borrow his water flask, and Martin agrees.\n\nEthac imagines home, and passes his concentration check.\n\nA thought house appears. Abbey goes in to investigate, and sees a somewhat normal (if rather Spartan) living room.\n\nElfred attempts to set the house on fire with his flint and tinder. He does not succeed.\n\nThe rest of the party goes inside. Elfred attempts to set the couch on fire. He succeeds.\n\nEveryone quickly exits the house.\n\nThey decide to follow the river for a while, and come upon a deserted village. They agree to scout the village. Abbey goes west while Elfred goes east. They each stop and look around. \n\nAbbey finds a cache of food and strange magical glowing dust. Elfred spies a glowing dagger. He goes to pick it up and triggers a sonic trap, taking three damage. For those of you still paying attention, yes, they just split the party into not two, but THREE parts.\n\nI decide not to punish them for this because I am so shocked that I cannot think of an appropriate punishment.\n\nThey meet up again.\n\nElfred attempts to set the MAGICAL GLOWING DUST on fire.\n\nHe succeeds. It explodes.\nElfred takes four damage, leaving him with 1hp.\n\nEthac attempts to imagine a *way* home, and succeeds. A red door appears.\n\nEthac studies the door, and determines that it will return them to the material plane, but not to anywhere any of them actually desire to be on the material plane.\n\nThe party decides that this is a good time to rest. Yep.\nThe rest is uneventful, but when they awaken, the door has become purple.\n\nElfred goes right in, triggering a (rearming) daze trap, and deftly evades it. He loses consciousness amidst a swirl of light.\n\nThe rest of the party argues for a while.\n\nMartin goes in, again triggering the trap, and again deftly evading it. He loses consciousness amidst a swirl of light.\n\nEthac attempts to push Abbey into the door, but fails his grapple check (I'm a new DM, pushing is just a grapple check for now, and that is that).\n\nFlummoxed by his failure, Ethac decides there is no other option remaining, and runs around Abbey and into the door. \n\nHe expertly evades the rearming daze trap, and losses consciousness amidst a swirl of light.\n\nAbbey is rightly confused by all of this nonsense, and runs into the door, expertly evading the daze trap and losing consciousness amidst a swirl of light.\n\nThey awaken in a field somewhere on the material plane, memories and equipment intact. To their north are some hills, a forest, and some mountains. To their south is an orc village in a valley.\n\nAfter ruling out attacking an entire orc village, they head north towards the forest, and encounter a 10 strong orc patrol coming out from behind a hill.\n\nAbbey, Martin, and Elfred hide. The wizard tries to hide and fails miserably. The still glowing guard dog sits there glowing and wagging his tail, because no one has told him to do otherwise.\n\nRealising the patrol will definitely find them, Martin calls out in orcish, asking them who they are and what their business here is.\n\nThe patrol, clearly having no purpose patrolling the area - it's not like there's an entire orc village just down the way or anything - is momentarily baffled into silence. They then immediately demand the same information from the party, in common.\n\nThe party (rightly) explains that they have no idea what so ever as to what is going on. Amazingly, the orcs believe them.\n\nThe party explains that they want to go north, into the forest, and the orcs tell them that they are insane, because no one returns from the dark forest. The party insists. Backing away from the clearly insane people, the orc patrol heads back to the village.\n\nThe party continues on towards the forest. Which they are only heading to because they are worried about fighting the village of orcs. The demonstrably level headed and peaceful orcs, who even warned them about the dangers about. The dark forest is clearly a better idea.\n\nWhen they reach the edge of the forest, they just charge in, forcing their way through the dense underbrush into the near nigh time darkness under the deep forest canopy. Elfred the elf skips about merrily because he is an elf, and that is what elves do in forests, as they aren't encumbered by forest things.\n\nElfred scouts ahead (because splitting the party worked so well last time) and catches sight of a road to the east. Shouting this news, everyone eventually gets to the road, and they head north.\n\nThey come across a boat. On further inspection, they find a dead body in the boat, notice that it is weather worn and partly buried, and that it is dripping blood.\n\nElfred fills his other water skin with the dripping boat-blood.\n\nHe then takes an arrow, sticks it into the ground, and pours some of his thought-river water on it. It starts to glow (but is still not a light source).\n\nThe party continues north on the road, and comes across a boat and a glowing arrow. Elfred exclaims \"I knew it\" and the party begins to argue internally again. They decided to turn around.\n\nThe winding road quickly starts heading downhill again, and as they continue north (yes, they're still going north, none of them notice this quirk) they come to a large tree in the middle of the road.\n\nElfred dumps his skin of boat blood on the tree. Because why not.\nThe tree bursts into flames, which quickly become jet black.\n\nEthac carefully studies the tree and discovers that the flames are an illusion. He keeps this information to himself. He decided to touch the tree. Because why not. His right hand goes numb.\n\nThe party hurries onward in silence, then they hear a rustling of bushes and such.\n\nMartin fails his listen check, and just guesses that it is coming from behind him. Abbey passes her listen check, and determines that it is ten metres directly behind her. Elfred passes his listen check, and determines that it is exactly ten metres directly behind him.\n\nThe party attempts to continue on, but finds vines are blocking the path. The vines are moving.\n\nThe party is fighting a 4 hd vine monster. Everyone passes their initiative, and the first two people to attack both successfully hit... they do 7 and then 8 damage, each on a d8 roll. The vine monster is already dead. Elfred loots the corpse and finds a top hat. He decided not to equip it, because it's probably cursed.\n\nDeciding it is time to scout around, Martin orders his glowing guard dog Foofy into the forest. It happily runs off into the underbrush.\n\nAt this point, Abbey has to go, so we put the rogue on auto-pilot. She will simply follow Martin everywhere with a dazed expression on her face, doing skill checks if the party actually remembers she's there and to ask her to do them, and Bad Things will generally not befall her.\n\nThe party waits for a bit, decides the dog is lost forever, and continues on.\nThey come to a dark black river.\n\nElfred takes his empty water skin, ties it to a stick, and dunks it in the river. Because it might come in handy some day I guess. It and the stick come out jet black. He decided to not touch the black parts.\n\nElfred and Martin try to throw their grappling hooks across the river to make a rope bridge. Both of them fail and the hooks and the end of the ropes they are attached to fall into the river and also become jet back. They pull them back and try again. On the second try, they both succeed.\n\nThe party decides to send Martin the halfling bard across first. They tie a rope around him so they can pull him back to shore if he falls in. He crosses successfully up to the point where the ropes turn black, and decides to jump the last three feet to the shore. He is successful.\n\nElfred and Abbey go next, they both cross and jump successfully. Ethac crosses successfully, but fails his jump, and lands in the river. He quickly scrabbles out of the river, because it is freezing cold, and very spooky. His legs up to just below his knees and the bottom of his robes are now jet black. Ethac must now make occasional will checks when moving to avoid losing one dexterity (cumulative).\n\nThey continue along the winding road and Ethac immediately fails his first will check. He now has a -1 penalty to his dexterity.\n\nThe trees part and the road opens up into a small clearing, ringed by the forest, with another road at the far side and a three story dilapidated looking house in the middle of the clearing. The party decides to investigate the house.\nMartin walks up to the front door and triggers a daze trap, but deftly avoids the effect. Martin opens the door (which was not locked!) and sees a room that is empty except for a single painting of mountains.\n\nMartin decides to steal the painting. As the bard steps into the room, his feet sink 5 cm into the floor, which is thick and soupy, spreading ripples across the room. Martin immediately does an about face and \"gets out of dodge.\"\n\nElfred decides to whack at the window with his quarterstaff. It sinks into the window and becomes stuck. In an attempt to rescue his quarterstaff, Elfred tries to set the house on fire. The entire house catches fire instantly and produces a whirling column of flames 500 feet high.\n\nThe party debates whether or not to flee in terror. Elfred wants his quarterstaff back, everyone else wants to flee in terror. The party manages to convince Elfred to also flee in terror. \n\nThey reach the far road leading back into the forest. The whirling flames is causing the shadows in the trees to produce meanacing shapes. Worried about another vine monster, Elfred dumps the black-river water skin onto one of the trees at the edge of the forest.\n\nThe tree turns black, it's branches twist and gnarl, and the leaves fall off. This effect spreads out to all the other trees in sight like a plague.\n\nIntrigued by this effect, Elfred attempts to set the tree on fire.\nHe succeeds.\nThe entire forest bursts into flame.\n\nThe party flees down the road between the burning trees through the burning forest, because there are no rules governing thermal radiation in my reference, therefore it does not exist.\n\nThey manage to escape the burning forest and come to a dry riverbed. The road leads up to a bridge over it, there is a fence on the near side, and a sign beside the bridge which reads \"Beware: DO NOT CROSS\".\n\nElfred shoots the sign with his bow and arrow. \nThere is now an arrow sticking out of the sign.\n\n-- To be continued, because character limit",

        "text": "Co-written by both /u/thestartrekkerdude and I, this story chronicles the events of a game I DM'd where we went through the module We Be Goblins Too.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/33mxel/pathfinder_tales_from_the_vestofholding_we_be/)\n\n[Part 2: Heart of the Owlbear](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/342mk0/pathfinder_we_be_goblins_part_2_heart_of_the/)\n\nOur goblin party consists of:\n\nReta the female fighter (Chief of the Birdcruncher tribe, leader of the group, and eater of hearts)\n\nChuffy Lickwound the male rogue\n\nPoog the male cleric of Zarongel\n\nMogmurch the male alchemist (Keeper of the glue)\n\nNow on to our story!\n\nNow accompanied by their piggy friend, the goblin party decides to investigate the three hen-houses which lie just north of the main building. Chuffy begins to enter the closest one out of a desire for chicken meat; however, this idea is shattered when Chuffy trips over his own feet and crashes violently into the hen house. The hens within cluck wildly from fear, and this awakens a feral Rottweiler who just-so-happened to be fast asleep out of sight nearby. The hound growls, an earthquake of sound that erupts from his throat like fire licking the molten gates of hell itself. The goblins are understandably intimidated by this fearsome beast, and they retreat as the hound charges directly at them. All except for Reta, that is. \n\nReta draws her flaming dogslicer, staring with determination at the foul beast before her. Time seems to slow to a stop in the heat of the moment, when the dog leaps, mere feet from Reta’s face. Reta slashes low with all her might in desperation against the horrible dog. Her blade strikes true; the dogslicer earns its name as it cleaves through three of the dog’s legs, sending the beast flying past her in a catatonic state of shock, surprise, and disgrace.^1\n\nNaturally,  Reta takes advantage of the downed animal’s state to rip out the poor hound's heart, and immediately eats it while it still convulses in a pitiful quasi-rhythm. She then proceeds to flay the hound's skin from its still-warm body, and wraps her precious owlbear egg in the fruits of her labors. The discerning reader may begin to question at this point what was going through Reta's mind during these actions, since clearly she finds some value in playing with her food. The answer, if ever there was one, is: not much.\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the party quickly loses interest in Reta's activities, and they set their gaze on their final obstacle: Pa Munchmeat’s house. Mustering up their courage, they make their way up to the front door. Reta trails somewhat further behind, distracted by her interests.\n\nChuffy, our intrepid rogue, decides to look inside the house before entering it. He climbs up the ramp to the house, and peers in through a nearby window. His efforts are greeted by the sight of an angry, gigantic ferret. The man-sized beast lies poised in an alert state with senses heightened, body quivering with excitement, and ferocious jaws tasting the air in eager anticipation of goblin-scent on the breeze. Seeing this long, savage beast, Chuffy sees an opportunity; he prepares his bow and stealthily loosens an arrow at the offending ferret. His aim is true, and the shaft flies clean through the ferret's neck, ignoring those pesky laws of physics as it explodes through the ferret and into the wall behind it.\n\nSmelling blood, Reta immediately charges up the ramp, barrelling past her compatriots in a frenzy. The front door is large and soggy after years of neglect and abuse from the elements; Despite that, Reta quickly manages to break it down. She enters the house, ignoring the pain from slamming through the thick wood.\nRejoicing at seeing yet another carcass for her to desecrate, Reta eagerly pounces upon the dying beast and begins her (now routine) ritual. As she removes the heart and clutches it greedily in her fist, her trance is broken by a large, female ogrekin who bursts down a door across the room and yells in despair and anger: \"\"SPIKE!!!\" Pa Munchmeat’s daughter, Guffy, now stands in horror and rage at the goblin standing over her dear pet ferret, now a limp heap on the ground in a puddle of its own blood.\n\nReta locks eyes with the raging Guffy. Determined to play beta to no one, she eats the heart while staring down the ogrekin before her. Inexplicably, a deluge of rhythmic, carnal music rains down upon them from everywhere and nowhere. Every beat mocks the absence of any from the heart that so recently pumped life through the ferret.  Every beat marks the absence of another piece of the heart as Reta devours it.  Poog praises Zarongel in the belief that it is him who has sent down this beautiful music.^2\n\nGuffy is dumbstruck by the desecration of her dear Spike, and doesn't know how to react.  As the music fades away, Guffy finally recovers from her shock, and begins to charge Reta with a roar, savage morningstar in the air.\n\nMogmurch reacts quickly and throws one of his fire bombs at Guffy. He misses, however, and the bomb sails past her before exploding against the wall just a foot or two behind her. The explosion sends Guffy stumbling forward, throwing off the charge that she was beginning to make upon these evil, evil goblins.\nReta charges in herself, slashing ferociously at Guffy with her sword and taking a significant chunk of the creature's abdomen out with the fiery stroke. Guffy roars in anger and retaliates with her morningstar, but she misses in the midst of her blinding rage and pain. Chuffy fires an arrow at Guffy which hits successfully, but the ogre is unphased by it, distracted by her seething rage at Reta.\n\nIt is at this moment that Poog experiences his moment of glory. Brain boiling in the blood-lust of battle, Poog opens up his mind to the heavens in praise of the god of most-holy mounted combat. Pleased by the worship of his follower, Zarongel heeds the plea of his disciple and sends forth divine power of unimaginable proportions. As a result, Poog lets loose the most powerful Channel Negative Energy spell that he has ever casted in his life. The spell blasts into Guffy full-force, forcing itself upon her mind with the full strength of goblin religion. Guffy is knocked out cold.  \n\nPoog raises his weapon to strike the killing blow, but is stopped by Reta's interjecting arm. Reta commands Poog to stabilize Guffy in a state of unconsciousness. Poog is offended by this blasphemy, for such mercy is surely an affront to any respectable and decent goblin.  After much coercion (and a swift reminder of who is chief), he obeys. \n\nNot wanting to waste the good chain mail armor that Guffy had, the goblins removed it from Guffy’s unconscious body.  Unfortunately it was too big for any of the goblins to wear, so they elected to put it on Squealy Nord.  It didn’t quite fit since it was made for a humanoid, but they made it work by gluing it directly to Squealy Nord’s body.\n\nWith that important task out of the way, Reta set about implementing her plan for Guffy.  Reta ordered Poog to watch Guffy carefull, and took her flaming weapon and chopped off Guffy’s arms and legs, making sure the wounds were properly cauterized.^3  Poog liked where this was going and dutifully performed any necessary healing to ensure that this process would not kill Guffy.  Not quite satisfied with her work, Reta cut out Guffy’s eyes and glued them to the top of Squealy Nord’s head.  Her work on Guffy complete, Reta took the dead, long body of Spike the giant ferret, and tied it around Guffy in order to drag Guffy’s unconscious body around with the party.\n\nReta's plan for the Birdcruncher tribe is coming together nicely.\n\n^1 Allowed something that awesome because the attack did a staggering amount of damage compared to the dog’s rather pitiful health.  Plus, the dogslicer might as well earn its name.\n\n^2 What happened in real life almost makes this worse.  Reta’s player locked eyes with me as if I were Guffy and mimed grotesquely tonguing the heart in Reta/the player’s hand, while Poog’s player pulled out his phone and began playing trap music and dancing along.  The result is an experience that is easily the most bizarre, surreal, and I think horrifying experience I have ever had playing any role playing game.  I think I’m a different person now.\n\n^3 And that is apparently how you nugget a creature\n\n[Part 4: Killing the Final Boss From Full Health in One Round](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/34z2ej/pathfinder_we_be_goblins_too_part_4_killing_the/)",

We don't have much time.\n\nChase em down to a cave. Very first room: fork in the path. Left or right.\n\nLet's split the party!!\n\nThe end result of that decision was ... an owlbear attacks. While everyone runs around trying to meet back up, the owlbear murders the Lawful Good Paladin and the Chaotic Evil Warlock. And severely wounds everyone else. Terrible rolls all around. Took like 7 rounds to kill this thing. We're a 5-person party.\n\nAt this point, we're like:\n\n*Fuck*, man.\n\nWe *almost* killed one monster without losing anyone. But not quite. Restart campaign with new characters?\n\nWarlock says no, hold on, not done yet. Talks to Asmodeus, whom she has a pact with. \"Damn dude, you send me to do evil deeds in this city and then make me fight an owl-bear in a cave and die. What gives?\"\n\nAsmodeus feels generous. And also kinda miffed at this fucking owlbear because it murdered his follower for no reason and kinda spoiled his grand plan.\n\nBut he doesn't feel *that* generous. 36% generosity, precisely.\n\nWarlock doesn't get a full resurrect. Gotta be an undead.\n\nAsmodeus sends down an imp to plant the Warlock's soul gem back in her body. Adds some effects to it to allow the Warlock to use her soul gem to control her corpse.\n\nWarlock begins to rise.\n\nBut wait!\n\nSorcerer has a personality trait: \"will go to any length to obtain items she decides are valuable.\" Rolls an Arcana check on that soul gem: *critical fail.*\n\n\"Look at the size of that ruby!\"\n\nSnatches it out of the Warlock's mouth. Warlock collapses. Sorcerer pockets the soul gem.\n\nAsmodeus is all like, *fuck*, man. Alright, what do I do now? How evil am I today? (rolls) I am precisely 94% evil.\n\nWhile the Bard explains to the Sorcerer the finer details of a soul gem, *come on girl, you should know this, you like magic don't you?* ... another Imp comes down with:\n\nThe Paladin's soul gem!\n\nThe imp places the gem in the Warlock's mouth.\n\nLawful Good Paladin (male) is now in the body of a Chaotic Evil Tiefling Warlock (female). Who is *undead.*\n\nAs soon as he realizes:\n\n\"I AM AN ABOMINATION UNTO GOD.\"\n\nTakes the sword off his own dead body and runs himself through.\n\nThe DM stops laughing long enough to say: \"You deal yourself 5 damage. You now have a sword in your chest. You are otherwise unaffected.\"\n\nSorcerer looks at the soul shard in her hand. Looks at the undead Warlock with the mind of a Paladin trying to kill himself.\n\nJams the soul shard into the hole the sword made. Gets the gem right up there in its guts.\n\nDM can't breathe.\n\n\"Okay, Warlock and Paladin: to control the body, you must beat the CHA roll of the other player.\"\n\nPaladin rolls to yank the sword out to stab himself again.\n\nWarlock rolls to keep the sword in.\n\nReanimated dead Tiefling body is just playing tug of war with a sword jammed through its own ribcage.\n\nWarlock says \"Fuck it, the Paladin's soul gem is in my mouth. I spit out the Paladin's soul gem.\"\n\nPaladin protests. Rolls a CHA save. Fails.\n\nWarlock has full control over her undead body.\n\nGoes to stomp on the Paladin's soul gem but the Rogue snatches it up first. Pockets it.\n\nEveryone's hurting pretty bad, so they say \"Fuck, man, Jesus Christ, this was fucking brutal. Let's go back to town and rest up. This is getting fucking crazy and this zombie Tiefling chick is freaking me the fuck out.\"\n\nRogue and Bard leave, but the Sorcerer wants to do some experimentation first. Warlock agrees wholeheartedly.\n\nWarlock and Sorcerer make a friendship pact and agree to wreak the *choicest* of havoc together if their crazy schemes work out.\n\n#Experiment 1\n\nDoes the Warlock's soul gem have to be in her body to work?\n\nWarlock digs in her own guts and pulls out the soul gem. Collapses. Just holding it does nothing. It's gotta be \"inside\" her.\n\n#Experiment 2\n\nDoes the soul gem work regardless of where it is located in the body?\n\nShort answer: yes. Long answer: Sorcerer washed her hands pretty vigorously afterwards.\n\n#Experiment 3\n\nCan the Warlock take over live bodies?\n\nNope. Sorcerer held the Soul Gem in her mouth (after washing it and purifying it for well over an hour) but there was no effect.\n\n#Experiment 4\n\nWhat about dead bodies?\n\nPaladin's body: yes.\n\nOwlbear's body: DM could barely keep it together before squeaking out: \"Yyyyyyyyyyep, looks like it.\"\n\nFucking sweet. Undead owlbear.\n\n#Experiment 5\n\nDoes it stack Inception-style between creatures?\n\nWarlock gets back in her body and carves a hole in the owlbear's side like the Wampa from Empire Strikes Back. Gets right up in there. She's undead anyway, she doesn't give a shit.\n\nNope, that didn't work.\n\nHold on, Sorcerer's got an idea.\n\nShe skewers the Warlock pretty damn hard into the owlbear's guts using the sword still stuck in the Warlock's chest.\n\nTakes out the soul gem and jams it right down the owlbear's throat. Digs around in there and carves a path on the inside from the owlbear's throat to the Tiefling stabbed into its stomach.\n\nNow the Warlock controls the owlbear, and her body is skewered to its guts for safe-keeping.\n\nIt is a Tiefling Owlbear Shish Kebab.\n\nThey immediately agree that the Sorcerer will ride this undead owlbear into battle. And if things get too hectic, she'll use Mage Hands to push the soul gem through the owlbear and into the Warlock skewered inside. And the Warlock will burst out Alien-style from the owlbear's stomach with Thaumaturgy effects blazing at full strength, flames everywhere, +2 to intimidation, plus another +2 because shiiiiiit, you guys are fucked up, *yo.* Damn.\n\n#End result\n\nA sorcerer rides into battle on the back of an undead owlbear, flinging endless fireballs and scorching rays while dashing at 240 feet a minute. Owlbear mauls anything that moves for ridiculous damage. It collapses lifeless just as a Tiefling Warlock bursts out its stomach spraying poison gas and hexes. Nothing survives.\n\nAnyway yeah, they storm the dungeon and murder the baby dragon before it has a chance to attack. Saving a grand total of two villagers!\n\nThey gallop off into the sunset to live happily ever after. The end.",

        "text": "Yet another old story from the way-back days of my campaign, this one taking place more than a year ago in real time, back before 5th Edition was out. The party was completely different than it is now, and only one person from that time is still with me today: our paladin, He Who Gets Shit Done. This is the story of how he and his comrades met and allied with an owlbear who took a particular interest in forest fires.\n\nAt the time, the players had been exploring an underground tunnel system looking for some plot-related documents. The paladin had gotten to said documents by critically succeeding on a roll to headbutt open a locked and booby trapped steel safe. Y'know, as you do. Upon exiting the tunnels, the group finds itself in a forest, and it isn't long before they encounter goons of some sort. Time has blurred the specifics of the fight, but I believe the fighter (fellow who disbanded that cult in [a previous tale](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2zkvlc/dd_5e_how_one_dwarf_disbanded_an_entire_cult/)) critically succeeds using some highly OP ability against an enemy with a scant handful of HP left, and the paladin jokingly rolls to help. It isn't his turn, but at that point in the fight it really doesn't matter anymore and I let him roll. He also crits, so I determine that the two combine their power in a grand bullshit attack which causes the enemy to explode in a massive fireball. The surrounding area becomes a smoking crater, and the nearby forest catches fire. The fighter and paladin are pretty fucking pleased with themselves, and the whole group is fairly smug, so I decide to mess with them a bit. Suddenly, I say, the fire goes out, and from within the depths of the forest lumbers a massive owlbear. He surveys the area and speaks, his voice deep and resonant. \"My name is Smokey the Owlbear. Who here's gone and set this forest fire?\"\n\nMix of confusion, amusement and fear ensues. Notsurewhattofeel.jpg.\n\nSeveral moments of silence follow, then the paladin steps up and, as he tends to do, Gets Shit Done. He produces from his pack one of the distinctive cloaks worn by the cult whose members had been serving as the campaign's primary antagonists and rolls to convince Smokey that they had started the fire. He rolls very fucking well, and Smokey believes him. \"Thank you, sir. Remember, only you can prevent forest fires.\" I modified the quote slightly so it wasn't a *blatant* ripoff. Anyway, Smokey lumbered away to go decapitate some cultists, and that was that. A joke had been had, the game went on. Or so I thought.\n\nA few sessions later, shit has escalated significantly and the Secondary Big Bad has reanimated an ancient dragon which had been buried beneath a city and is wrecking shit. The party is forced to flee into the forest, to which the dragon begins to set fire in addition to the city. I'm making shit up at this point, no idea yet how the party is supposed to defeat this thing. But then I get an idea. From within the forest, Smokey the Owlbear lumbers forth. \"Hello, friends,\" he says, \"I need your help. Only you can prevent this forest fire.\" He goes on to explain that in order to defeat this dragon, he needs to perform a ritual to infuse himself with the power of nature. This ritual requires several rare reagents, which he sends the party to retrieve, fighting with them as an NPC for the duration of their search. When the materials have been gathered, Smokey performs the ritual and takes on the form of a massive green dragon. He fucking wrecks the big bad dracolich, then flies off into the sunset, ever vigilant against the forces of arboreal combustion.\n\nAnd that is how a joke begot another joke which ultimately became a plot-important NPC. Bizarre? Yes. But it's just business as usual for these chucklefucks.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/34d4it/how_to_kill_a_lich_like_a_luchedor/",
        "text": "I'll skip most of the plot leading up to the battle so I can just get to the juicy bits of the story.\n\nA lich was tasked by its master with poisoning a river at a point that was upriver of a major town.  Our heroes (being mostly noble...according to a very loose definition of the word) decided to step in and prevent this.  Now, this lich was not a very powerful lich by lich standards.  It was probably the lich that other liches picked on and maybe even killed once in a while so they could draw mean things on him while he slowly re-formed near his phylactery.  But he was still a *lich* and therefore the heroes were in for a fight.\n\nThe heroes approach the tiny island (the \"island\" was probably 50ft by 20ft and mostly just mud with a few trees) in the river where the lich had set up shop to do his poisinin'.  The lich sees them and battle is joined.\n\nThe party, still in their boat, launch an impressive volley of magic and arrows at the lich.  Or rather, at the illusion of the lich.  Oops.  He responds by casting a Freezing Sphere at their vessel, effectively trapping their boat in a thin layer of ice a fair distance from the mud island he was on and frosting the heroes in the process.\n\nThe next round begins and the party ninja uses some ninja tricks and skips, invisible, across the ice to the island where the lich is gloating over his prowess.  The other heroes busy themselves either trying to break apart the ice in front of the boat or casting Fly upon themselves.  The lich hurls a lightning bolt and rattles some more teeth.  So far things are going pretty well for him.\n\nThe ninja is able to zero in on the lich's location by observing where the lightning bolt originated and paying attention the the footprints in the mud.  He manages to sling mud onto the lich so the other PC's can see him and whack him a couple of times with his magical wakizashi.  The lich falls back on some defensive magic as he moves to submerge himself in the river...because not having to breath is a nice advantage in this instance.  About this time some of his good-for-nothing ghouls and wraiths show up.\n\nBlah blah blah.  Spells are cast, swords are swung, and as his minions are cut down the lich realizes that the odds of him winning this fight are getting slimmer.  Especially when the paladin pimp-slaps him with a smite that takes him below 10% health and triggers his contingency.  In this case, the contingency was simply a dimension door that ported him a short distance down the river (at the bottom of the river, where he *thought* he'd be safe).\n\nThe heroes are still salty about the whole \"trying to poison the river\" thing, though.  They manage to home in on his location by flying around and using detection spells.  The lich decides that bravery is overrated and steadfastly refuses to leave the safety of the river bottom to engage the party, even though the PC's are pretty beat up at this point, too.\n\nThe sorcerer then has an idea.  The kind of stupid, moronic idea that is perfect for ending Mexican standoffs.  \n\n\"Dive into the water and try to grapple him.\"  The sorcerer tells the cleric of Gorum flying next to him.\n\n\"...You're plan is for him to paralyze me with his touch attack and watch me drown, then?\"  The cleric responds.\n\n\"I'm willing to risk it.  But ideally I'm going to use telekinesis on you once you're grappled to pull you both out of the water.  Then we can just light him up with arrows once he's airborne.\"  The sorcerer responds.  The bow-wielding paladin nods eagerly.  The other party members seem cool with this, too.\n\n\"Okay, that sounds legit.\"  The cleric agrees.  He figures the worst case scenario is that he dies but can tell Gorum that he bit the dust trying to do something that was really metal.  Without further ado, he shoots down into the water at top speed.  His momentum (and his full adamantium plate) propels him to the bottom where he meets with the shocked lich.\n\nA brief tussle ensues and the cleric passes his save vs paralysis and locks the very upset lich in a full-nelson.  A moment later, they are both being yanked up out of the water and into the sky.\n\nAny of the PC's with ranged weapons fire them off like they're shooting at a clay pigeon (nevermind the fact that one of their comrades was basically wrapped around their target...they don't let those kinds of details bog them down too much).\n\nSome hit, some miss.  Unfortunately the paladin rolls like garbage and the lich survives the volley just barely.  Eager to gtfo, the lich activates his magical cape by saying the trigger word....\"CURSES!\"\n\nUpon uttering the trigger word, he is Dimension Door'd yet again.  Only this time he takes the armor-clad cleric of Gorum with him.\n\nThey appear roughly 400ft away and 30ft up in the air.  \n\n\"What do you do?  Your flight spell is gone and you're about to fall.\"  The GM asks the cleric.\n\n\"I guess I pile drive him and use my adamantium plate like a weapon.\"\n\nHe rolls. Natural 20.  The lich is smashed to dust via flying piledriver.  \n\nThe rest of the party finally catches up and moves to the small crater in the ground where the cleric landed on top of the lich.  They inquire if he is okay.  \n\nIn response, the cleric throws up the horns.  And Gorum is proud of his servant.",

        "text": "I lost D&amp;D today.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nThe edition: 5th.\n\nThe story: a heavily modified and shortened Lost Mine of Phandelver. In this one, wild-magic-stuff plants called Cornberries, wrought from goblin \"genetic material,\" wreaked havoc by causing wild magic effects, turning everyone into rat-dogs, and transforming Sildar Hallwinter into a dwarf tarrasque (that could only be damaged by rat-dogs), among other things.\n\nThe party: All chaotic (I picked an alignment without looking at theirs because it fit my concept and... I'll stop now.). My CN barbarian, whose hatred for cornberries is only matched by his friendship with his similarly-aligned partner in crime, a rogue (she also dipped a level in fighter). A CG druid with unclear goals. A seafaring wizard, whose MO is \"punishing the wicked\" through extreme means, like burning down taphouses after nailing bandits to the door. After going insane by growing an all-seeing third eye for a short time, he became CE. A CG ranger and his bird companion. A CG (sort of) warlock of not-Cthulhu (as I dubbed it).\n\nThe scene: We have defeated a certain drow and found a magic stone. The wizard retrieves the magic stone and plants it in his forehead a la Diablo. The party proceeds to fight amongst itself for possession of it.\n\nMy character, determined to destroy what he perceived as the source of all cornberries (its power pervaded the waters of the mines, mixing with the goblin stuff to make cornberries), even if it cost him his life, wanted to destroy \"the cursed rock.\" The rogue wanted to escape with the stone sell it (the DM admitted that this would end very badly), but the player said that she would agree to destroy the stone if offered enough in payment. The wizard wanted to get revenge and basically become a demigod. The ranger wanted to destroy the stone, but didn't get a chance due to being strangled while submerged in cornberry-based healing water by the wizard. The druid aimed to rule as the queen of the goblins (who love those who consume cornberries, but hate those who refuse). The warlock wanted the rock for unknown reasons, but clearly bad ones: he was commanding the goblins to get it to him, even if it meant killing the other party members.\n\nDuring the struggle, my barbarian finds himself at the bottom of a 50-ft pit (\"the Thunderdome\") with a bugbear, the warlock, and the stone. The barbarian managed to attack the stone a few times, leaving a couple of cracks. The wizard had just fallen to his death in an attempt to get the rock.\n\nOnly having 1 HP left and knowing that my character wouldn't make it out alive under any circumstances, I announce a Reckless Attack. I roll a natural 20.\n\nHere's where it gets bad.\n\n**I forgot to roll the extra critical damage die.**\n\nI only remembered after my turn had ended.\n\n**The rock needed to take 1 more point of damage.**\n\n*One point.*\n\nAnd I forgot to roll the extra die.\n\nTrue, destroying the stone would have sent the whole place up in what amounts to a **glorious nuclear explosion**, but that's what I was going for: one last blaze of glory. The journey would have meant something.\n\nMy character promptly falls unconscious and gets ingloriously stabbed to death. The rogue dies around this time as well. At least they died together in the \"Thunderdome,\" right? Right?... Sigh.\n\nThe druid cuts her losses and leaves, setting up fires around the mine's entrances. The ranger gets the rock off of his chest, dashes through the flames, and escapes. The warlock gets possession of the stone via goblin proxy.\n\nHe takes it to an underground lake and sends it into the water with a bugbear minion.\n\nAn eldritch abomination sealed by the gods appears and makes the warlock into his CE undead-eldritch-horror right hand.\n\nThe world is corrupted. The druid tries to help people out, but dies. The ranger flees, but is killed years later for backstory-related reasons. The corrupted warlock goes insane and eats his own entrails, then dies.\n\nThe bad guys win. I sulk about it for the rest of the day and post about it on Reddit. The end.\n\nAll because I forgot to roll my critical damage die.\n\nFM(gaming)L\n\n**tl;dr: Because I forgot to roll my critical damage die, an eldritch horror awakens and everyone dies, as opposed to everyone dying in a nuclear blast or something.**\n\n~~**tl;dr tl:dr: X-MEN! WELCOME TO DIE!**~~\n\nIncidentally, if you happen to be the DM reading this, I do honestly and without sarcasm recommend the Call of Cthulhu RPG. It's right up your alley.\n\nEDIT: I guess I'm just venting. It must make for poor reading. I'll leave it up, though, because, you know... *One die.*",

        "text": "We're playing a custom world that's being fleshed out as we go along (using 4.5e Dnd). Sorry about length, I need to give a little back story, but it will lead to our last session that was fucking ridiculous. So here we go...\n\nMy friend's character started out as a berserker from a nomad elf tribe. He hates Civilization and has a staunch Warrior's code. Turns out he's a bastard son of a king who spent his younger days traveling. Turns out their bloodline is important for preventing a volcano from erupting (imprisoned primordial involved). King dies, Bastard takes throne reluctantly after succession shenanigans. His character and mine always got along well, and we always had each others back in a fight.\n\nSo new king leaves the party to rule, player becomes DM, and a new campaign begins. I should have known something was up when he started a bloody war over what turned out to be a misunderstanding and sent our party in as special forces. After this war he appoints an advisor, rejoins the party, and we head to the next campaign. \n\nI made a dwarf, and was basically told that they live on a series of archipelagos off the mainland, and was allowed to do what I wanted from there. I mashed together Japan and Norway. Each Island is basically an independent fortress ruled by a lord, kinda like daimyo. It's impossible to assault the fortresses, but they are connected by tunnels made from lava flow, and are heavily controlled and taxed by the lords. Only thing the separate islands have in common are the raiding parties that attack the coast in longboats. \n\nI fed all my ideas to the current DM, Who has done an amazing job fleshing the islands out and creating all sorts of intrigue and drama that would need an entire post in and of itself but here are the necessary highlights. \n\nMy character was a former raider who left to find his fortune, doing all sorts of odd jobs at sea but basically becoming a pirate captain with his own ship. After being away from a long time I was invited back in what turned out to be a trap, and I was now involved in a brewing civil war for the unification of the islands into a single nation.\n\nSo two major npcs concerning the earth shattering session are cousins; two noble, dwarven ladies related to someone very close to winning the game of thrones (one's a niece and the other's his daughter). \n\nThe niece marries our old friend the elf berserker king because of a duel. The other becomes engaged to a commoner in control of a large faction of raiding parties, who also happens to be my brother (she needs soldiers and both want to improve the terrible lives of the common people).\n\nWe have this huge checklist of things we have to do to ultimately unite the kingdom and expel invaders that have shown up during the chaos, so the party decides to help my brother and his fiancée because they seem like good candidates. The two of them had originally faked her kidnapping (which we didn't know about at first) and her father, the almost-king sent us to get her.\n\nA group of religious fanatics who want a dwarf pope in charge do not like the idea of a foreign elf berserker king being close to the throne and decide to kill the niece. I fight tooth and nail to save her during an ambush where the party is separated and I take an arrow for her.\n\nSo next session we're uniting daughter and father, who has gone a little crazy with his daughter missing, and we're attacked by mercenaries who want them dead. The father is super confused and out of it, and the Berserker elf king attacks him. I'm pissed. Our striker duelist rogue goes next, and the berserker elf king is like \"take him out.\" Rogue is like, \"Wait why? isn't he our patron or whatever?\" He then proceeds to one-hit kill the poor, senile man with all of his dailies. \n\nThe guards start going after the Berserker and Rogue, who tries to pull off a bluff to convince the daughter she doesn't know him, forgetting they've meet multiple times.  The berserker then proceeds to cut a hand off the daughter, and I try to stop him from killing her. The rogue sides with him (but avoids attacking players), and our gnome rune-priest sides with me, and now the party is split in half.\n\nThe berserker-king kills the girl, I grab him to keep him from escaping and eventually the gnome lands the hit that knocks him unconscious. I try to get the rogue to calm down, but we both know I'm killing the Berserker for this. he'd do the same to me. Turns out he's been behind a bunch of the bullshit we went through, including falling out of a god damn airship. Our rogue casts some darkness ability and tries to move Berserker-king but ultimately fails. He takes some of his items and flees, swearing to kill me and take revenge.\n\nSo then the berserker and I talk. about how the crown changes people. visions of possible futures and unfinished business. There will be more elves coming to kill my brother because of nomad, blood-fued culture and his kingdom will come after me for killing their king. Then there's the primordial under the mountain. We said out goodbyes and I dropped my axe into him.\n\nThat's basically it. Now the berserker and rogue have to roll new characters to rejoin the party and the gnome rune-priest and I have to deal with the aftermath. Can't wait! \n\nEdit: Should probably add a TL;DR\n\n-Civil war in campaign leads to civil war in the party. One of the players was working against us and fucked us over, ultimately killing an important npc. I had to kill the player on principle and another player has sworn revenge.\n\nEdit: posted in /r/gametales on suggestion. Hope you like it! oh and apparently 4.5e is what my friend called essentials, which I don't even think we're using. ",

However this does mean that rather than having to only flair one story a day in a casual manner, when I arrive I'm sometimes seeing multiple stories unflaired, due to having to participate in things like life and sleep.\n\nWe've also recently launched TelltaleBot, who only adds his poster history after a story is flaired, so getting a post flaired promptly is very useful for that reason too.\n\nSo is there anyone reading this who visits here multiple times in the day, and would like to assist us in doing some story flairing?\n\nIf you're interested, comment or PM. I'll write up a quick guide, and if your post history isn't that of a madman, I'll make you a mod.\n\nThanks, folks!",

The players choose from a giant robot, monster, or size-changing superhero for their character. They were tasked with investigating the disappearance of ships in the Pacific Ocean. \n\nThe freighter they were on came under attack from a colossal, undead whale that dwarfed them and their ship. \n\nThe man and the older nephew were experienced at role playing and eagerly jumped into describing their characters and actions. The younger nephew, though, was very reserved and needed some egging on from his family. I should mention the younger nephew played a giant saber-tooth tiger. \n\n\nDuring his first turn during combat, this changed. He whispered: I want to jump off the ship, burrow into the whale's back and sever its spinal column. \n\nAfter some impressive rolls, he managed to pretty much cut the thing in half. \n\nTL;DR: a wallflower new to RPG's managed to win the day through a spectacular act of violence.

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/347qui/dd_5e_how_my_players_cheesed_around_a_moral/",
        "text": "This one's a story from a while back that my players have been bugging me to post for a long time. Haven't gotten around to it until now due to the volume of new shenanigans, but we haven't had a session for a couple of weeks and so the well of fresh tales has gone dry. Therefore, here's how they dethroned an emperor and freed a nation of slaves without spilling a single drop of blood.\n\nSo, a few months ago real time and a year or so game time, the group was in the Han Empire, a nation dominating a subcontinent in the southern hemisphere, inspired by a blend of Japanese and Mongol cultures with a little Slavers' Bay from Game of Thrones tossed in. They'd traveled there because their home kingdom was being invaded by a powerful empire from the south, and the players hoped to convince the Hans to lend their legendary military might to the vastly outmatched kingdom. To do that, they needed to resolve an ongoing slave uprising, lead by an NPC (originally a PC whose player departed for college) named Echo.\n\nThe Hans were a very xenophobic nation, to the extent that the only foreigners permitted in the country were merchants and diplomats, and they were not allowed to travel beyond a small section of the Hans' single open port city. The party tagged along on a merchant ship and snuck off when it docked to enter the city. As none of them were particularly stealth-oriented, the guards quickly apprehended them and demanded that they surrender their weapons. Vastly outnumbered, the group agreed, and the guards then went around confiscating magical items on the characters' persons. This led to one of the guards touching the Luck Amulet. I don't recall if the Luck Amulet has come up in any of the tales so far, so allow me to explain: Every time anyone touches it, excluding the passive contact of the wearer's clothes and skin, a random thing happens. Unlike the Wabbajack and the Jakkawab, the Luck Amulet has no tables. No targets or wielders, not even a hard and fast DC for determining if the effect is positive or negative. It is an instrument of my whim as a DM. As such, the players have learned to almost never touch the thing, as my whims are rarely benevolent.\n\nThis time, the amulet blew out the walls on either side of the gathered guards and PCs in the alley they were standing in, showering them in rubble. Everyone takes a metric shit ton of damage and nearly all the guards die, with the PCs taking very serious wounds. This appears to be good news, until reinforcements arrive. The surviving guardsmen explain the situation, and the party is clapped in manacles and hauled off (carefully) to the city magistrate for judgement. Once there, the ever-diplomatic paladin manages to convince the magistrate that, given that he traveled with Echo in the past, he would be able to get close to her and negotiate an end to her uprising. The magistrate, unsurprisingly, tells him to assassinate her instead, and sends one of his slaves with them to ensure they comply. The party travels to the city Echo has liberated and is currently using as the base for her rebellion, passing Daenreys-style crucified slave masters beside the road on their way there. Upon entering the city, the group is shortly taken to see Echo, who is delighted to see her old friends again and holds a feast to honor the occasion. The slave sent to keep tabs on the group is relieved of his means of contacting his master, but is otherwise unharmed and declared a free man. After the meal Echo implores the players to help her overthrow the Han emperor and free the nation's slaves. She promises the party all the military aid their kingdom requires once she takes the throne, and presents a plan to make it happen.\n\nThe Han Empire was an absolute monarchy, with the emperor holding all power. He almost never appeared in public personally, however, and the majority of day-to-day tasks and interactions with the people were assigned to the Hand of the Emperor, a powerful adviser appointed by the emperor personally and who stood to inherit the throne in the event of the emperor's death. Below him was a council of five people, known as the Fingers of the Emperor, who advised the emperor and administrated certain aspects of the government. Echo's plan was to murder the emperor and the Hand, leaving the Fingers to quarrel over who would claim the throne, hopefully leading to a war of succession. This unrest would give Echo the opportunity to sweep in with her army of freed slaves and topple the empire.\n\nThe players were pretty divided about this. We actually stopped playing as the guys engaged in a long, involved, serious debate about the matter. It was pretty fucking rad for me to watch, as I love it when my game manages to have a real impact on the players. The issue was that Echo's approach would entail the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of slave owners and innocent civilians, as tends to happen in the process of sacking a city. She would be freeing the slaves, but in doing so plunging the empire into bloody chaos. On the other hand, Echo was their friend, and betraying her to preserve a corrupt and brutal regime was not exactly the right thing to do either. They weren't able to reach any kind of agreement, and ultimately decided to travel to the capital and gain more information before choosing a course of action. Once there, the city guard, having heard of the group's quest to kill Echo and end the rebellion, demand to know if the deed is done. A quick bluff gets them escorted to the palace and brought before the Hand of the Emperor himself to present evidence of the job's completion. Once again, time in-game stops while everyone argues back and forth about what to do. Several hare-brained schemes and rounds of circular reasoning later, the paladin (whom I like to call He Who Gets Shit Done) steps up and makes a decision. He pulls the Deck of Many Things from his pack and asks the second most powerful man in the Han Empire a question. \"Would you like to play a game?\"\n\nI have him roll Persuasion. He rolls very fucking well. The Hand draws a card. He picks the card that gives him the answer to his next dilemma, which he used to solve some bullshit problem involving administration of the empire. Delighted, the Hand draws again. This time, his soul is removed from his body and imprisoned. The Hand of the Emperor collapses like a rag doll in the middle of the throne room, and only a couple frantic Persuasion checks prevent the palace guards from slaughtering the whole party. The paladin manages to convince the guards that fainting is a side effect of the Deck's power, nothing to worry about, and the group accompanies the doctors who carry the Hand out of the room. In the next room, once everyone is distracted caring for the Hand, the sorcerer discreetly casts Animate Object. He reasons that, since the Hand's body lacks a soul, it is literally inanimate and thus qualifies as a target for the spell. I allow it. The Hand gets up and declares all is well, then strides back into the throne room with his attendants in tow, leaving the party alone. With the clock ticking until the spell wore off, the group uses Wandering Eye to find the emperor's quarters and make the risky decision to try to teleport there. Fortune favors them, and they arrive at their intended destination unscathed, leaving the emperor understandably distressed.\n\nBluff and Geas checks are failed, and the emperor flips shit. He screams for his guards before bum rushing the paladin. The paladin headbutts the most powerful man in the Han Empire and knocks him the fuck out. Sorcerer quickly uses Dominate Person, automatically succeeding since his target is unconscious, then everyone hides as the guards enter. The dominated emperor assures them that it was actually just a spider, and amazingly this works. With the all-powerful ruler, revered almost as a god by his people, at their mercy, the party comes up with an idea. This time, the players all agree to the plan.\n\nSoon after, it is announced that the emperor will appear in person on his balcony to address the people. This shit never fucking happens, so the entire city gathers in a massive crowd before his palace to hear their beloved ruler speak. The emperor emerges and the people go fucking wild. He begins to speak, and they all fall silent. With the sorcerer pulling the mental strings, the emperor delivers a long, impassioned speech to his people, announcing that he has had a revelation about the evils of slavery and the shortcomings of his own rule. He declares that, for the good of the empire, he will step down and abdicate his throne to Echo, the hero who has opened his eyes to the value of freedom and individual human rights. This pisses off a lot of people (myself included), but their plan was solid; the sorcerer's last command to the emperor was that he board a ship and go into exile, and the Hand conveniently fell down some stairs and broke his neck before the animation wore off. Echo ascended to the throne and freed the slaves, and the former masters couldn't do shit about it without their slave soldiers. Her first action as empress was to open the borders and orchestrate a formal alliance with the party's home kingdom, sending troops to push back the invaders. The PCs were all granted land and titles by Echo for their role in bringing her to power, after which she set about implementing far-reaching reforms within the empire.\n\nThere would be unrest in the Han Empire for many years to come, and Echo would face many challenges to her rule. No fucks were given at the time, though, because the players were all too busy celebrating having overthrown a whole god damn empire without having to actually make a difficult moral choice and without any bloodshed whatsoever. Needless to say, they were pretty fucking pleased with themselves.",

        "text": "Disclaimer: posted in another subreddit, just trying to get as many eyes on it as possible.\n\nFor anyone who has read the wheel of time series Hinderstap is a memorable piece of the story. None of my players have read the wheel of time so I am going to use that to my advantage.\n\nI really like the idea of Hinderstap and want to use it in my campaign. The idea of the villagers all going berserk and fighting each other and the PCs will make for a shocking and memorable game I hope. Especially if the PCs die and then wake up stuck in the town. Cursed to live their with the villagers repeating the nightly massacres.\n\nThis is where I need help. From a mechanic standpoint I will not give the PC's experience for the villagers or each other that they kill. Their memories of the night will be extremely fuzzy and sporadic. They don't gain EXPERIENCE because they don't really remember the experience and thus it doesn't help them to better themselves. This will keep the PCs from \"grinding\" levels by just staying around.\n\nNow to the point that I need your lovely help. There is an immediate chokepoint right at the start. If they are not in town after sunset then nothing happens. i need a hook to keep them there. Especially because the townsfolk will try to get them to leave. I have a few ideas but they all seem to be very strongarm tactics and I want to avoid that if possible.\n\nMy next hurdle is I need the PCs to be able to solve the problem. Right now I am thinking a curse that can be broken, I don't want it to be an item. I was thinking more like a ghost's curse. I am racking my brain for ideas on how to bring clues together that get the PCs to the right conclusions and then to a solution.\n\nright now I was thinking of doing a forbidden love angle that resulted in deaths that lead to the ghost curse. This however feels cliched as hell and I want to avoid being that cliche DM. Some item of evil also feels really cliched too. I could also go an angry spirit ( nature, fiendish, even celestial doesn't matter) Yes I know I am stealing the idea from a story in the first place but I would love to put a personal spin on it without it being so many cliches.\n\nIf I did either of those angles then it;'s a matter of searching and talking to people till they learn the truth.\n\nHowever I know there are creative people out there, Help me out please!\n\nWhat are your ideas on how to bring this to DnD? what is the cause, how would the PC learn the truth and what is your solution?\n\nThis is a long ways off in the game. I expect the PCs to be level 4 or so before they encounter the town. Perhaps lvl 3. We are finishing up a different campaign at the moment before we start this one and I already have a story to bring them to lvl3 or 4 before this begins.\n",

        "text": "Hey folks! Hope everyone had a great weekend!\n\nSo last time we left off the GM had just given Grethor the ability to pick what he wanted to have as Omegas extended backstory. Which I thought was awesome. The Dragonkin was also still asleep so the door remained open!\n\n---start---\nThe wizard followed the path down to another chamber, the air was cooler here and the stench of decay was masked by the smell of moisture and salt. The wizard peered over his shoulder at the knight and construct as they continued to talk about the prospect of Omega finding his family and the creators of his kind. He wanted to tell Omega about his brothers but knew it would have to wait till they were out of the passageway again.\n\nTitus smiled underneath his visor at the construct. Omega had questioned the knight about his family for a while and Titus was more than proud to describe in great detail about his family and how their nobility was renowned across the far lands.\n\"So Titus is rich?\" Omega asked excitedly.\n\"Sadly far from it Omega.\" Titus began, \"Although we are a rich house and we are able to afford most luxuries I do not own any part of it until it has been left to me.\" he explained. \"My father owns all of it and we do not believe in giving to those without earning.\" he continued.\nOmega nodded, \"So Titus got a job and began saving?\" he asked confidently sure of his understanding of human culture.\nTitus laughed, \"Something like that lad.\" he said cheerfully.\n\nGrethor waved at the party advancing towards him as he took a seat on a ruined section of an altar. \"Looks like we've found the habitat area lads.\" he pointed to the end of the cavern, \"These tombs were often loaded with areas like this so the occupants could have lifestock or people staying for an extended amount of time.\" he chuckled, \"Sorta like a guest room in a castle.\" he finished getting to his feet.\nTitus looked to the section covered in darkness that the wizard had pointed to. \"What's that sound?\" he asked the wizard.\nGrethor cleared his throat, \"Fresh water my lad.\" he smiled, \"An artificial waterfall designed to give a more homely feel as well as supplying the air with moisture so that life can be sustained.\" he breathed heavily, \"Also means you won't die of dehydration.\" he finished with a smile.\n\nTitus looked around the room, \"So where are we meant to be looking for this treasure?\" he questioned.\nGrethor scratched his beard, \"The waterfall was brought up by our employer.\" he began, \"It hides the final cavern that we need to go into.\" he finished motioning to the area the noise was coming from.\nOmega looked over the edge of the cavern to the waterfall. \"We go down there?\" he asked.\nTitus nodded, \"Looks like it lad.\" he replied as he caught up to the construct.\nOmega began to climb down and approached the waterfall, the closer he got to the water the wider the stream became before a neat archway of water formed allowing him to walk in without the water touching him. He waved the all clear as the rest of the party joined him. Titus looked at the archway of water in awe as Grethor chuckled, \"Your kind were artists in their own ways lad.\" he said with a smile to Omega. \"Shall we take a look inside?\" he said with a smile motioning to the archway.\n\nOmega and Titus nodded and entered before the wizard. The party climbed the stone staircase in relative silence as they reached the room that contained the treasure they had been seeking. Titus paused as they entered the doorway. The room was illuminated with bright emerald candles and the walls draped with fine silk... all warning signs to the experienced knight who proceeded to withdraw his weapon and shield. Grethor nodded as he raised his staff motioning for Preeta to take a step back and the bard to check for reinforcements on the stairs. Omega silently removed his sword and raised it in a combat stance.\n\nA voice called out in a whisper, \"You have returned our forsaken son.\" it began. The party tightened their grouping, Grethor smiled and lowered his staff.\n\"It's ok lads.\" he began, \"We're safe.\" he finished as he motioned for the party to lower their weapons.\nThe voice seemed to approve of their choice, \"Friends.\" it began, \"Come into our chamber.\" it added. \"We want to see our son again.\" it finished gently.\nGrethor smiled and took a step forward, he placed his fist over his chest and looked at the most prominent wall. \"I am grethor and these are my band of travellers.\" he introduced himself with pride, \"We seek the key of grey iron.\" he added, \"Do you have what we seek?\" he finished.\n\nThe voice called out once more, \"Our son. We have the key. Bring us the son.\" it said slowly. \"We have waited for him so long.\" the voice spoke eerily.\nOmega paused, \"Am I son?\" he asked meekly.\nThe voice replied, \"Once there were many now there are few.\" it replied, \"Our son has come home at our time of need.\" it finished.\nOmega held his hand out and removed the gauntlet, the mark shone brightly and illuminated the dark sections of the room.\nThe voice called gently, \"Our son is home.\" it finished in a almost powerful tone before the wall slid down slowly and a blinding light filled the room. As the light dimmed a figure walked towards the party blocking out the remaining light from blinding them.\nGrethor turned to the construct with a smile, \"Lad.\" he began before pointing to the source of the light, \"Welcome home.\"\n---end---",

        "text": "I posted this elsewhere, but I thought you guys may like this story of a D&amp;D session from a while back. Feedback is appreciated. This is an excerpt from the travels of the elven rogue Sigil (yes I know of the city, no I didn't at creation)\n\n\nSo we meet our hero on a ship with his companions. They had just restored order to the government of a city and sailed off to find new lands. Their journey was not an easy one (as journeys tend to be in D&amp;D) they were beset by many a ravenous beast and dangerous weather patterns. It turns out that their troubles were due to a rift in the plane opening up. It released several hideous monstrosities that attacked the crew of the ship. Sigil and company leaped to defend the ship and her crew. Sigil noticed that an elf woman had also appeared and hurried to her rescue. After the party had cleared off the last monster the woman \"attached\" herself to Sigil, never leaving his side. It had been months since Sigil had seen another of his kind, and being the egotistical bastard he was, he didn't mind Merrill (the elf woman) hanging around.\n\nAs they journeyed on, Sigil noticed several of his other companions becoming irritable and short tempered. Usually only characteristic of Wuzalaan (the lizardman). What he didn't notice was that Merrill, who was incredibly frail and weak only a few days before, had become much healthier. When they reached port the party was at the boiling point and everyone split up to go drink away their frustrations\n\n\nSigil and Merrill found themselves exploring the countryside as he regaled her with tales of heroism and danger. They were ambushed by bandits (because that's what happens when you split up) and Sigil was severely wounded defending Merrill. She exhibited a hither to unknown power seemingly draining the energy from their assailants, to the surprise of Sigil.\n\n\nThis was about the same time the wizard (Alhazrhed) came running down the path. He had done what he does best and figured out just what Merrill was (everyone else had been suspicious of her from the get go). Following behind him was the still very pissed off Wuzalaan with the slightly less pissed off monk and druid in tow. Alhazrhed explained that Merrill was no elf, but a creature called a joystealer (not exactly the one from the monster manual). She had been feeding off the party since she arrived and now they were out for blood. Sigil, still injured, stood up to defend her. This led to a massive argument. Insults where thrown, threats made, and intentions were assumed. Eventually Sigil was able to convince them that Merrill wasn't a monster and Merrill agreed to not feed off the party.\n\n\nTime moved on and the party eventually accepted Merrill...mostly. They experimented with \"feeding\" her enemies and monsters they fought so she could survive and it worked well enough. Sigil and Merrill had a blossoming romance (most of which took place in my head because romance in dnd can get incredibly awkward to put it lightly) which only grew as they saved the world together. Sigil and Wuzalaan taught her how to fight, and she became a great NPC sidekick.\n\n\nEventually, the party delved into Baator for they needed the help of a particular devil. As they made their way down through the hells, they found a magical bow that did bonus damage based on charisma. This was not a particularly charismatic party so the bow fell the the most social of the bunch, Sigil. Sigil had a better idea though, he gave the bow to Merrill who's charisma had to be astronomical at this point. Then then continued to talk and fight their way down until they met the archfiend they needed.\n\n\nTheir talks broke down and it became clear that there would be no bargain with this fiend. In the ensuing battle Sigil gets blasted to another plane (but it looked like he was just blasted) and Merrill went a bit off the deep end. She succeeded in draining this incredibly powerful devil and ran off.\n\n\nSigil awoke to find himself at the foot of Olympus mons. There seemed to be the aftermath of a massive battle and smoke was rising from the summit. He scrambled his way up the peak and at the summit found Merrill, sitting on a throne, with the floor strewn with dead gods. He looked up at her, aghast, and saw nothing in her eyes. The Merrill he knew and love was gone. She called out to him but he simply shook his head and left her there, sitting alone in what was now a celestial mausoleum. Eventually, his friends retrieved him and they returned to the material plane to rest.\n\n\nIt wasn't too long until Merrill returned to the material plane, this time with intent on conquest. Sigil ventured to her fortress in order to plead for her to stop and go back to who she was. He was thrown out. The council of kings was convened to address this threat as Merrill prepared to take the material plane as her own. Sigil returned to them having failed and agreed to a plan hatched by the council. They were going to use him to bait a trap to imprison Merrill before she could do more damage to the universe.\n\n\nSigil brought Merrill to neutral ground to one last time beg for peace. Instead it was a trap, a final betrayal by Sigil, to stop her. They sprung their trap to bind her soul to a gem. The gem spewed forth brilliant light. Sigil watched with a heavy heart and Alhazrhed, his closest friend, stabbed him in the back. Sigil's blood was the last thing they needed to seal the spell. As the two former lovers gave their last breaths, the gem flashed brighter than the sun and then all was deathly quiet. The blood red gem sat, lying on the ground, next to the lifeless corpse of Sigil. It had been done. The group somberly collected their friend, another job well done.",

They play live on Twitch every Thursday from 7-10 pm (PST) if you are a subscriber you can watch the VOD's afterward(kinda sucks) or wait until they post the video on the above page. They are a group of voice actors and they play their roles beautifully, they have been playing the same characters from 2 years now(I think?) and they have that \"thing\" that happens when you have a wonderful group of friends who enjoy each others company and work well together.\n\nI highly recommend these two things and I enjoy reading everyone tales so much I just wanted to share something that i thoroughly enjoy with y'all here.\n\nI hope you like them!!",

        "text": "So, I started a campaign in Eberron to get used to using modules for an upcoming game I'll be running this summer. I used the adventure in the campaign setting and brought in a few players to have some fun. 5 players, and 1-2 npcs. The character that this story is about is named Graver Glaive. A shifter barbarian who refers to himself in the third person, and is a little impulsive.\n\nImpulsive is an understatement. Reckless, and oblivious, would be better descriptors. In the first session the party encountered a swarm, and got fairly beat up. Glaive rages to attempt extra damage with a torch, does a little damage and the swarm gets killed the next round. The Healer takes a moment to heal a couple of hurt characters and turns to Glaive. \n\nThe player asks, \"Is it my turn in initiative?\"\n\n\"Ummm, sure?\"\n\n\"Graver Glaive Going in!\" And Glaive rushes off into the next area, to get ambushed by the dire rats in the next area, to fall to his wounds, prompting everyone to rush forward and save him.\n\nThat's the kind of character Glaive is.\n\nSo at the end of the first adventure Glaive takes the arm of a fallen warforged, with the intent of melting it down or otherwise getting the adamantine components from it. Sure, why not? It was more reasonable than trying to drag the metal door up a 50 ft shaft. And then they get into the town proper, get rewarded for the quest, and I ask if anyone wants to do anything.\n\n\"I want to go to a smith.\" - Glaive\n\n\"Okay.\" Makes perfect sense, he wants to go buy something with his loot.\n\n\"I go into the smith and take out the arm and ask him if he can melt it down for me.\" - Glaive\n\n&lt;blink&gt; &lt;blink&gt; \"Roll your diplomacy.\"\n\n\"I got a 9.\"\n\n\"The smith tells you to leave right now.\"\n\n\"What? Why?\" - Glaive\n\nAs the smith, \"Because That's a PERSON'S ARM!! LEAVE BEFORE I CALL THE WATCH!!\"\n\nI want to take a moment to note that in Eberron Warforged are distinctly mentioned to be people, following the *Treaty of Thronehold*. So our reckless barbarian just walked into a smith and asked them to tear apart someone's arm. SMH\n\nGlaive takes the arm, hides it in his pack, and leaves. But information is now out there that he has a warforged arm. And that was where I was planning on leaving it. There was about a month's downtime in the city, and each of the characters made money and used their professions. Glaive wanted to get into wrestling, so our NPC rogue gets him into an underground event. It was Legal-ish. Generally not lethal combat, great way to gain some fame. But I run random encounters as a d6 chance. On a 1, there's an encounter, on anything else, nothing. \n\nGlaive rolled a one.\n\nAn encounter.\n\nSo I gave him the only thing that made sense. An agent (warforged) of the Lord of Blades heard about the wrestler with the warforged arm, and vowed revenge. I picked the character up right from the beginning of the next planned campaign, named him Scimitar, and they get ready to fight.\n\nThe other players place bets on the fight (I had an entire odds table set up), and they get started. The odds are in the warforged's favor, and it is a close match. The warforged gets rocked down to 1 hp, and he counters with a blow that knocks Glaive to 0 hp. Another attack from Glaive and he's bleeding out. He can attempt to give up, flee, or attack. And he attacks.....\n\n.....And Misses.\n\nGlaive goes down. -1, bleeding, and helpless. Before anyone else can act, Scimitar grabs Glaive by the arm, lifts, and removes it at the shoulder. Glaive's rage is gone, his arm is gone, and he is D-E-D, dead. Scimitar leaves with Glaive's arm before anyone can stop him (or even really thinks about stopping him).\n\nWhen Scimitar ambushes the party later on (as part of the module) he is proudly wearing Glaive's arm at his waist.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/343i4j/delta_green_how_my_players_explored_the_theme_of/",
        "text": "Over the past few weeks I did a follow up to an Easter themed Delta Green one shot, which you can read about [here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/23m21w/how_my_players_burned_down_the_garden_of_eden/) - [We stopped someone from making Jesus clones but also released Beelzebub from his prison by burning down the Garden of Eden] \n\nI wanted to stick with the wacky holiday centric setting so I set up a St. Patrick's Day mini campaign. Four Delta Green agents spend the holiday in a quaint Irish town where tourists were claiming occult occurrences or just straight up dying in awful ways. \n\nA quick rundown on the player characters!\n\nJoe Black. A veteran marine and model IRS Agent. The brains of the operation. He is disguising himself as an American priest on holiday to get inside information on the local parish.  \n\nClara Lavigne. A French diplomat/ retired guns dealer. Pretty much YOLO incarnate. She also carries a strong hatred for Joe. She is in town to give a cram course in French to one of the town locals. \n\nClaus Shmidt. An ex-Neo Nazi trying to atone for his past mistakes through devotion to his work at a Holocaust Memorial Museum. He is the eccentric player. His cover is as a film maker documenting holiday traditions of the Irish people. \n\nEdith. Just Edith. An elderly postal service-woman, who was introduced as an NPC in the last game. I find her very similar to Roz from ‘Monsters Inc.’. Edith is visiting an old senile woman in the hospital and she plans to convince her that they are good friends.\n\nEdith is played by the GM of the Easter game. We decided to switch up GMs so my character, the Austin Powers inspired Ai Putoutski, a bad-ass muscle headed West Point teacher, is not in this game. \n\nThe characters begin their day at a local B&amp;B a few days before St. Patrick’s Day.  \n\nKlaus and Joe get up early to attend Sunday mass, Klaus with his film equipment and Joe in his religious garb. Joe is offered to do a sermon by the local priest. He nopes out of it to avoid suspicion that he isn’t a priest. After mass, Joe goes to the parochial house and attempts to go through the financial records of the parish, rolling a critical failure. A radical Catholic woman catches him and accuses him of being a bad representative of the church and threatens to report him. Meanwhile Klaus is spending time meeting the people in town and gets offered to sit in on Sunday school.\n\nEdith and Clara enjoy breakfast until they hear painful moaning from the B&amp;B owner’s bedroom. They come to her aid but realize too late she was having sex with unarguably the hottest man they have ever seen. Hottie McHotterson flee’s the building half naked and embarrassed. Edith rolls a critical failure to resist his charming looks and is compelled to chase after him. She attempts to hide her lust by scolding the young man for engaging in pre-marital sex. The man disappears before she catches him. \n\nAfterwards Clara goes off to meet her French student who is a balding heavy set 40 year old man. Clara fails some rolls that would hint that some supernatural stuff is happening at her student’s house. Clara would continue to be plagued with bad rolls the entire game. I honestly didn’t know what to do. \n\nAround noon, Klaus films a lesson at the school about the Irish legend of The Salmon of Knowledge which gives knowledge to those who feast on it. The teacher is very stern in addressing that it is just a fairy tale. Klaus leaves the school after stealing a bunch of paperwork from the principal’s office not bothering to read any of it. \n\nEdith visits the police station where a cop is trying to profit selling confiscated goods to tourists in St Patrick’s Day “Boxes O’ Green”. Edith buys two boxes. She gets a beautiful Ren. Faire style Celtic dress and a crystal drinking glass that compelled her to drink. She decides to buy some whiskey at the convenience store to enjoy with her ‘old friend’ in the hospital. The store clerk mentions the woman in the hospital is his dearest mother. He begs of Edith to deliver some of his newest poetry to mother and read it to her. \n\nOn her way there Edith reads the poem to herself. Hmm, this poem reads like an accurate account of Edith’s deepest sexual fantasy. Safe to say Edith never ends up delivering the magic granny porn. When she gets to the hospital Edith bonds with the old woman and convinces her that they are buddies from the war time. The old woman mentions how much she hates her son and his creepy poetry. \n\nJoe decides to break into the home of the radical Christian woman. In her basement he finds a large stockpile of religiously themed weapons. Oh. He leaves with some hand grenades with celtic motifs on them. \n\nJoe then visits the police station to buy a Box O’ Green. He unboxes what he would find out is an enchanted drag queen wig. He goes to the inn, puts on the wig, and becomes filled with a need to look as glamorous as possible . He rummages through the B&amp;B for the right outfit, eventually finding the celtic dress Edith got in one of her Boxes O’ Green. \n\nClara continues her day with the creepy French student. They go study by the local river as the sun sets. Clara encounters a strange vaginal looking monument in the river with water flowing out of it. Clara sadly continues to fail rolls and doesn’t notice that the tree’s near the river are making the sounds of crying infants or that her student is acting very suspicious. He convinces her they should go study in the pub instead.\n\nAnyone of importance in town except Joe has already made it to the pub. Clara’s finds out that her student has ditched her. What a jerk. Meanwhile Klaus recognizes the principal from the school and begins to interview him about his influence on the town. \n\nJoe is now in full drag but decides to keep the clerical collar on as a fashion statement. On his way to the pub a little boy comes up to him in a sports jersey with a hurling stick and asks if she would like his autograph. Joe agrees and it is autographed as CuChulainn. As the boy begins to walk away, a man in dark robes hits the kid over the head with an iron pipe and steals his hurling stick and runs away. Joe shoots the man in the leg but he escapes. The boy is gone when Joe returns.\n\nIn the meantime Edith examines the poetry and puts together that the local salmon is filling people with sexual knowledge. She orders some salmon stew from the pub and waits for the fish to kick in. \n\nJoe makes a grand entrance at the bar and the room goes dead silent. The radical Christian woman comes up to Joe and says that this is proof that they are no man of God. Joe rolls to tell her off, succeeds and everyone in the bar cheers. The woman leaves the bar in anger.\n\nKlaus asks the principal if they can talk in private. He agrees and offers to drive to his place for an interview. Both the principal and Klaus are shitfaced. On the way, they hear gunshots go off and manage to get into a car accident with the town nurse and the elderly hospital woman. The principal tries to flee the scene as the nurse’s car catches on fire. Klaus only has enough time to either chase down the principal or save the people in the car. Klaus chases and stops the principal. Principal panics. Klaus and the principal barter information in a their panicked states and agree to investigate the town together.\n\nClara and Edith before going to bed once again interrupt the B&amp;B owner and McGoodButt from having sex. B&amp;B owner is furious. Player characters don’t care. Handsome man flirts with Clara before fleeing again. \n\nEdith goes to sleep and the fish kicks in. I end the session with having all my players write out their characters deepest sexual fantasies and giving them to Edith’s player. \n\nHope you all enjoyed this! I’ll be writing up part II soon :) \n",

        "text": "Co-written by both /u/thestartrekkerdude and I, this story chronicles the events of a game I DM'd where we went through the module We Be Goblins Too.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/33mxel/pathfinder_tales_from_the_vestofholding_we_be/)\n\nOur goblin party consists of:\n\nReta the female fighter (now also the chief of the Birdcruncher tribe and leader of the group)\n\nChuffy Lickwound the male rogue\n\nPoog the male cleric of Zarongel\n\nMogmurch the male alchemist\n\nNow on to our story!  We last left our adventurers recovering from a fight with a giant boar.\n\nOnce rested, the party casually continues on their mission (as you do after one of you has eaten the still-beating heart of your enemy), and our party makes it to the farm to find it surrounded by a large, yet obviously fragile, fence.  At the unlocked front gate, Pa Munchmeat has decorated the gate with the severed heads of the three chieftains who so pitifully challenged him mere days before.\n \nUndeterred, the four goblins head inside and go straight for the central house.  The house is up on nine foot stilts, and the gap underneath the house has been filled with straw, branches, and uprooted underbrush.  Something big appears to have made a nest. Unsurprisingly, as the goblins approach, a huge, roaring owlbear suddenly leaps out and begins to charge the party.\n \nChuffy bounces back and lets loose an arrow that lands with a solid thunk into the owlbear’s shoulder.  At the same time Poog releases a fire bolt spell that hits its target dead center.  The owlbear roars with rage in response.  Mogmurch then follows with a bomb, blowing the enemy back a little.  Undeterred, it launches forward with a vicious strike against Reta, giving Reta massive cuts across her torso.  Given that Reta was already having a rather unpleasant day before this turn of events, it’s understandable how she now screams and angrily slashes her flaming dogslicer around, cleanly slicing off the owlbear’s arm.  The owlbear staggers, but it refuses to back down.  Mogmurch then cackles madly at an idea that impulsively makes its way into his brain, and throws a vial of acid directly the owlbear’s face.  His aim is true, and the owlbear howls in pain as its face is covered in shattered glass and begins to burn and melt.  Finally the owlbear can take no more, and it collapses into the pale sleep of languorous unconscious.\n \nReta sees her chance and swiftly takes the only sensible action for this moment. Namely, she slices the owlbear’s head from its shoulders, reaches down into its enormous chest cavity, and rips out the creature’s heart.  Covered in blood, she screams in triumph and eats the heart.  It appears Reta has found a new hobby; a new-found taste for blood; an effort that clearly is not in vain.\n \nAfter the fall of the owlbear, the rest of the nesting material is investigated for further hazards.  Instead, the party discovers why the owlbear fought with such ferocity; they find six owlbear eggs that are clearly just a few days short of hatching.  It’s decided that each of the goblins would take an egg for personal use, with the last two eggs being part of the party loot for Reta to deal with later.\n\nIt was also decided that rather than fighting Pa Munchmeat in the confines of his own home, these goblins would simply burn the place down.  Unfortunately, they discovered that the entire area was far too damp for anything to burn properly.  The wooden structure of the house was even visibly swollen from all of the absorbed moisture.  They discovered this fact repeatedly, despite their best efforts to the contrary.  Science can be a bit of a wet blanket that way.\n \nAfter Poog heals Reta’s gaping wounds for the second time that day through the myriad miracles of goblin spirituality, the party goes veering away from the house in order to explore an overturned boat that is built into the western part of the surrounding fence.  As they drew near the boat, they see that there is one good-sized opening in the side that they can use to enter. Naturally, that hole is completely blocked by the massive hide of a slowly breathing animal.  Mogmurch slowly creeps up as close as he can, and peers around the edges of the entrance to try and determine what the party is up against.  There’s just enough room for him to tell that this is another massive boar, sound asleep underneath the boat.\n \nNot wanting a repeat of the last few battles, the party carefully prepares their assault against this defenseless animal.  Chuffy bravely sneaks up on the unconscious beast and launches a mighty arrow that shreds through the side of the boar.  Not that anyone notices, though, because this daring strike is quickly followed by a fire bolt from Poog and a bomb from the ever-resourceful Mogmurch. This bomb is so effective, in fact, that it blows the boar into violently exploding pieces, leaving only a smoking pile of gore and a blackened, red-stained pit of filth as a result.  Reta wails as she realized that her precious heart-to-be is gone, and begins looking around for any pieces that might remain to eat.\n\nDriven mad by grief, Reta promptly turns to her own owlbear egg and proceeds to lather it in the gore of the exploded boar. Ignoring the confused stares of her party members, she caresses the egg, hugging it tightly to her chest as she bathes it in steamy blood. She lovingly whispers to it, “you will be strong.” Clearly Reta has adapted well to her newfound motherly role.\n\nVenturing further inside the overturned ship, the party finds a grown adult pig chained up against the wall. It squeals at them, and Mogmurch prepares yet another of his lovely bombs. Poog stops them suddenly, though, for he has recognized this very special swine: this is none other than Squealy Nord, a pig who escaped from the Licktoad tribe several weeks ago. Squealy is much bigger now, oddly enough, but Poog could never mistake the animal that they once feared as an eater of goblins (though Squealy Nord would retort that he only ate the dead goblins that were thrown into his pit). Once Poog explains, the party celebrates that another piece of their tribe has survived and frees the pig.  Reta then gives Squealy Nord one of the leftover owlbear eggs to eat. Though at first hesitant, Squealy Nord ate the egg; a rather gruesome sight to behold due to how close the egg was to hatching.\n\nReta continues to mother her own owlbear egg, and takes some of the shell fragments leftover from Squealy Nord’s gluttonous orgy and sprinkles them over her own egg, letting them solidify in the congealing blood that adorns the shell in all its terrible splendor. Not yet satisfied, Reta looks around and sees the lonely tusks of the newly-exploded boar several feet away. She makes the only obvious choice: she commands Mogmurch to use his sovereign glue to attach these tusks to Squealy Nord’s distinctly tusk-less visage. Poog uses his affinity with animals to comfort Squealy, convincing him to allow the tusks to be attached.  With this new addition, Squealy Nord has not become the party's official mascot.\n\nContinued in [Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/34f8zr/pathfinder_we_be_goblins_too_part_3_how_i_learned/)",

He then began drawing everything out on our game mat, and setting it all up. As soon as the boats got close, our sorcerer threw a couple fire spells on each of the three ships. The GM was *very* upset we handled it so well. So he decided to give us hell. Very large sharks came, to feed on the dozens of drowning pirates. These sharks then began to pester our small boat, and we killed them. Then something called a shark *eating* crab showed up, and that started messing with our boat. Upon killing **that** we learned it was just the goddamn baby, and the momma came. It climbed onto our fucking boat, and we eventually killed it by cutting its guts open. That wasn't the last of it though. Out of its wounds fell a sack, this sack then ruptured releasing *hundreds* of goddamn fetus crabs. The babies flood onto our boat, we are forced to jump ship.

We told our children stories of them to keep them obedient and to warn them should they ever run across them. We saw the signs that were told of in the stories and i made my own story. I set out to find them. I would offer myself as tribute to save the rest of my tribe. They wore garbs of cloth and horn dyed black with skin painted black with charcoal. My presence surprised them. They spoke to me in a heavily accented version of the language of trade.\n\n“what are you doing here?” He asked me.\n\nI told him “You take people. And you seek to take one now. I would protect my tribe by going in the stead of one who is more important. Take me, and leave my tribe.”\n\nThe men conversed in a strange language then one approached me. “You would die so that others may live?”\n\n“Yes”\n\n“You offer yourself for sacrifice? Many consider our ways vile. Perhaps rightly so. You would willingly submit to this?”\n\n“If I let you take someone else i may as well be dead. If we fight we will certainly die. But if I offer myself I may save many more of my people. Yes.”\n\n“It will be painful” \n\n“I am ready”\n\nHe laughed “Hardly”. One of the other men hit me with the blunt end of a spear and knocked me out. \n\nCold, and a sickly sweet smell are the next things I remembered. it was a clear moonlit night. My bare chest had dew dripping on it from the tilted stone pillar to which i was bound. In the center of a large circle of stones was a large stone basin filled with a wispy black substance. There were men with red robs dragging bodies of in various stages of decay and dropping them into the basin; the bodies seemed to be consumed by the blackness. I went to call out but found that my mouth was gagged. \n    The robed men seemed to notice that i was awake and beckoned to somewhere beyond my sight. 2 men approached me and underneath their hoods i saw that they were also gagged. They pulled out large intricate knives and began to carve intricate runes into my chest and arms. Near dawn they finished. The brough some nature of liquid and poured it on my blood soaked body. It seared the burnt area like i once seared meat. Everything went dark.\n    When i awoke again i was on my back on a slab of stone. I could feel the warmth of the dawning sun on my body. Chanting filled the air; Foul rhythmic chanting that was only overshadowed by the sound of unintelligible whisperings in my ears. I tilted my head back; I was mere feet from the basin filled with writhing tendrils of wispy black nothingness. The slab was tilted toward the basin    such that the dew ran down towards the basin. A man approached the slab among the chanting and hefted a large sword and set it on my throat. There was a moment and then the man dragged the swords across my neck. The chanting stopped or perhaps I stopped listening. The whispers got louder as I felt my blood rush over my face and down my shoulders. Through the wound and the carvings I felt bitter cold seep into me and grasp my heart. Darkness took me.\n\nI gasped awake in a foreign location. I felt a dagger in my chest. I reached for it and pulled it out to find no wound. No trace of the carvings or my cut throat . The dagger had no blood on the blade.\n\nEDIT: Formatting \n\n",

        "text": "Ever screw over the DM so bad he makes the group change game systems? It's not easy to do. Fun, though.\n\n\nSo our adventuring group, aside from having [one of the most moronic sorcerers to ever walk the planet,](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/32nznm/dd_35korvis_the_idiotic_sorcerer_and_the_virtue/) A Spanish dual-wielding fighter with a suspiciously lower-class London accent, a Pacifist mage whose ability to turtle single-handedly required save-or-die monsters to appear before any tangible threat was felt, and a cleric who committed friendly fire with her crossbow so often that the front-line players took to wearing a shield on their backs because it prevented more damage if it was between their vital bits and her bow… aside from all THAT, we had good bluffing and diplomacy skills, which anybody knows is basically cheating your way through life. We were playing on the Natural 20 = critical success rule, and on several occasions, the party defused, mitigated, or entirely sidestepped massive encounters by making a lucky roll. Which is part and parcel of a tabletop RPG. But perhaps we were a bit cheeky about it.\n\nScenario 1: We've infiltrated the mountain keep of an order of militant religious zealots that are threatening war on the people down in the plains. We managed to find a hay cart driver who lives by the one universal truth of merchants: Money is good, and more money is more good than that. So we bounced gold coins off his forehead until he finally stopped arguing, picked up the not inconsiderable yellow pile at his feet, and loaded us into his delivery cart. Once we were dropped in the stable, we just had to wait for nightfall so we could “slink around, stealthy-like,” as our rogue so eloquently put it. The nice thing about religious zealots – they spend a lot of time wondering after their eternal well-being. Getting good with Pelor, or whatever lawful anal deity they knuckle their foreheads at. What this means is that earthly concerns, stuff like bathing, cleaning, feeding horses and such falls by the wayside. Which was handy, as we didn't feel like jumping out of a haystack suddenly and explaining why we were there while a pitchfork was stuck in our guts. So we crept out.\n\nThanks to the guidance and skill of our thief, we managed to move silently and unseen through the keep (he scouted ahead and when he found a patrolling guard, batted them on the head and rifled through their pockets, then told us we could move up while unfortunately forgetting to mention if and when he found anything on them). So we get to a particular hallway, and the thief says for us to wait while he scouts ahead. We were getting a bit bored at this point, and he usually took a few minutes, so we decided to poke around some nearby doors. The fighter drew the cosmic short straw and managed to open a door to a bunch of guardsmen just getting ready to bed down for the night.\n\nEver been eyed up by a platoon of drowsy guardsmen? It ain't fun. To your average guardsman, sleep is the only thing they care more about than their pay or their booze. Then the guardsman in the nicest nightshirt (well, the least-stained one - we assumed this meant he was the captain or somesuch) piped up.\n\n“'Ere now… what's all this, then? You ain't s'posed to be here, this wing is for guardsmen.” He sounds like he should sound, he sounds suspicious. We're about two seconds from getting rushed by a bunch of half-naked men for whom the concept of bathing is an annual event. The fighter pipes up, probably because he was the worst liar in the group and subconsciously he wanted to fail and then to stab them a lot.\n\n“We ARE guardsmen! We started last week. That's why you don't know us.” This was a natural 20. The DM insisted that given the nature of the situation, this wouldn't get us out of trouble entirely, but would buy us a few more seconds to think of a plan. The guardsman captain spoke again.\n\n“Huh… s'funny… We been walking the keep every day this week, and we ain't even run into one of you yet. I would fink we'd have seen one of yas….”\n\nThe fighter spoke again, mostly because we didn't have the time to explain what the phrase “[pressing your luck” means:\n\n“Well, we're the NIGHT guard! We don't walk in the day. Explains the whole thing.” Oh, we laughed. The DM laughed. It was funny. Then the fighter said he was serious, he was gonna try the bluff. The DM informed him, very sternly, that with no skill in bluffing, and no charisma, he would need another twenty.\n\nWell fuck me if he didn't roll another twenty. And we laughed again. The DM didn't laugh this time. He called a recess to get a drink. Then he came back and informed us that we were greeted as friends and comrades and we got games of dice going and drank with the guardsmen a lot, “Because why the fuck not.” I guess this encounter was supposed to be a big deal, requiring tactics, moving battles, keeping alarms form being raised… sounded really great. But not as good as the no-risk approach. So we got the guardsmen good and loaded, and only got a bit tipsy ourselves. Then we went to the Hierophant's room and decided that he wasn't such a bad chap, and wouldn't it be nice of us to let him meet his god quicker than he anticipated  and to ensure he had no valuables in the room that might make it look like he didn't take hos vow of poverty seriously.\n\nThen as the cherry on top, we had the guard captain, who was still technically conscious, walk us out the front gate and have the gatemen wave us off with friendly aplomb.\n\nWe were not gracious winners when we defeated the DM's plans.\n\nScenario 2: The hall of the mountain addict.\n\nWe were trekking through an underground mountain pass that wasn't QUITE the underdark, but close enough for comfort, in an effort to sidestep an army of religious zealots that were looking for us (including one very betrayed-feeling captain). We'd fought our way through a whole city of giant ant-men and were getting into some really complex tunnel systems. We hadn't seen the sun in a week or so. At one point we start to hear and feel probably the last thing you want to hear or feel in this situation – the earth moving. From the ground in front of us bursts [a giant, slug-like, slimy, brown thing.](http://spriggans-den.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/mm_delver.jpg)\n\nLuckily it wasn't looking for a fight and simply to greet us.\n\n“Wwwwellcommmmeeee, trrravellerrrsss. Wwwwwwhhhaaaaat bussssinessssss do youuu have heeeeerre?” His voice sounded like shifting earth, crashing boulders, and dropping pebbles. Luckily our wizard spoke Terran.\n\n“Hello! We were hoping to pass through the mountains to get to the northern foothills. Would you be able to help us?”\n\n“Peeeerrrhaaappsss… Thee ellldeerrrr willl wannnt to speeak with youuu… follllooowwww….”\n\nHe rock-slug thing turned and we followed, without asking further questions, mostly because we lost about five minutes of time listening to it answer. At length, we were brought to something resembling a settlement of giant rock-slug things, and led to the one they called elder (we couldn't see that he was much older than the rest, but maybe if we had a geologist in the group he could have verified). The elder informed us that he would help us through the mountains, if we would do something for him. This perked the group up. This was familiar territory for an adventurer. You do a thing, you get a thing. It's very simple calculus, and we were very simple people.\n\nSo the story, as it went, was the rock-slug things were called “delvers” and the mostly lived lives of quiet plenty, eating rocks, marrying other rocks, and making little tiny baby rocks. But one of them, several years ago, had left the village. This Delver was named Rrrrrrrrrrrrrr'ghatttttttttttttttt (Delver names are odd and don't translate well to common, but basically it sounded like a small rock slide with one small pebble bouncing down the stilled slide at the end about twelve or thirteen times before finally coming to rest in a small pile of dirt. It took about a minute and a half to pronounce correctly, and we all agreed to just call him “Argy” for short), and while out one day digging tunnels and eating rocks, he ranged a bit far and found some very special rocks, shiny and purple. Argy decided to taste one and found that while the taste was foul, the effect was… euphoric. Argy had discovered the first Delver drug. And he did what most people who make such discoveries do, he became the first delver addict. Then the first Delver drug dealer. He was eventually exiled from the village.\n\n In recent months, however, he had gone crazy digging more tunnels and decreasing the stability of the whole cavern system as a result. The Delvers knew they needed to take steps, but they had grown up with Argy, so they couldn't bring themselves to ace him themselves. Luckily, we had some experience acing people that lots of people liked (just ask one particularly betrayed-feeling captain on the surface) so we agreed to do the job for safe passage and a few smallish sized gemstones for our trouble. Just the size of our heads or so, nothing ostentatious. The elder agreed and we all set off to kill Argy, cheerfully debating whether or not we'd be better to use a sword, a chisel, or a shovel. The sorcerer suggested fire, because we could make puns about 'scorched earth.' We all agreed this was funny, but that the earth might be scorched, but it was still THERE. The GRASS was what was gone. We agreed to at least try the fire and see how it went from there.\n\nSo finally after wandering around a bit, we find a tunnel several hours away from the village and decide to set a little bait for our friend. It would take all of our cunning, but we knew we could do it. We had the rogue stand in the middle of the cavern, and yell:\n\n“Look here, fellows, here's a giant, purple, shiny rock! I believe I shall lick it! ...Mind you, chaps, that makes me feel quite nice!” The rogue had grows up in The Bad Part Of Town, and the group trusted him when he said he knew how to attract an addict. It turned out to be a well-placed trust, because the earth began to move and we all formed a circle. When at last, a Delver dropped form the ceiling to right in front of us, the wizard quickly cast Hold Monster while we got ready to end Argy's addiction, very very quickly. \n\nArgy was not pretty, even by rock-slug standards. His claws were all chipped and battered, his eyes were lined with rubble, and his coat of corrosive mucus was probably, strictly speaking, more mucus-y than it needed to be. The wizard asked to talk to Argy real quick. He HAD single-handedly paralyzed the bugger for us, and as he was a pacifist that would likely be his only contribution to the fight, so we threw him a bone and let him talk while we quietly debated what would get the first crack, the shovel or the fireball. Both sides had good merit. The wizard spoke to Argy (who couldn't talk back, being paralyzed as he was):\n\n“Rrrrrrrrrrrrrr'ghatttttttttttttttt… we have never met, but we have been to the village. We have met with your friends, neighbours and family, and they are of one mind. They are concerned about you. They worry that your need for the purple rocks has clouded your mind. They see you hurting yourself… look at you. You're ill. You could die if you continue. And you're endangering the whole network of tunnels. Yet none of them could come here to stop you because they love you and would not see you further harmed. We want you to come back to the village with us, and to work with the villagers to get over your addiction. It's time for your pain to stop. But you need to WANT to get better.”\n\nWe were stunned. Not only had the wizard not discussed this plan of action with us, it was also the hugest whopper of a lie we had ever heard. The wizard informed us and the DM that it wasn't a lie. Every word as such was true, and the sentiment was genuine. The wizard didn't want to kill anyone. He was a pacifist, after all. That saved him from having to make the bluff check. The DM calmly informed him that this was a pretty ludicrous plan, but he was free to try. The wizard rolled his diplomacy, which at this point he had considerable ranks in. He rolled a natural 20. The wizard freed Argy from his paralysis. \n\nEver seen a Delver cry? It's unsettling. They have tears, but they're all thick and greasy, and their wails of despair sound much like a pair of boulders falling onto a flock of cooing doves.\n\nArgy began to cry like a broken child, insisting he wanted to get better and that he as tired of being hungry and scared and alone. He came back to us with the village peacefully and met with the elder and cried and begged forgiveness ad help, and every rock-slug thing told him how much they loved him and in short the wizard talked the giant rock-slug man into going to fucking rehab. We thought it was hilarious. The DM was on his third drink by the time we all got head-sized emeralds and a friendly delver dug us a personal tunnel to the northern foothills, saying we could always return to the Delver caves.\n\n\nA few days later, the DM informed us that it was time to change game engines. We'd been running D&amp;D 3.5 for a while, resisting 4E like any sane person would. We were thinking of pathfinder, but the DM told us we would be switching to GURPS 4E, because the chances of getting a crit success or pass were lower. We didn't HAVE to switch, but he was only gonna run campaigns in that engine. So we switched. Which is not to say we didn't screw up his plans any more. Just we had to be more clever about it.",

        "text": "(This is a short tale from my Mongoose Traveler group, a tabletop game set in sci-fi space. I apologise if my writing style is jarring, I'm only slightly an idiot, I promise.)\n\nThe cuddleable, yet bearded man sat in the cafeteria of a low-tech spaceport, eating his spacey, sci-fi curds and whey and contemplating the unfortunate events that got him and his partner to this arsehole of the galaxy. Buckaroo, as he liked to call himself, was a genius. Genius is an understatement, Buckaroo was a fucking miracle of intelligence. But instead of using his incalculable IQ to help others and further technology, he used it to build robots and to grow the most potent weed ever. He was destined for greatness, but all he wanted to do was cruise the galaxy, taking names and smoking his coat grown greens and drinking his very expensive ~~stolen~~ grog. No wait, pillaged is a better word... Yeah, pillaged grog. From the zealous religious planet that grew the most delicious grapes in the galaxy, that were absolutely forbidden from being made into wine. Well somebody made those into wine because that's what this guy was drinking.\n\nBut unfortunately, for Buckaroo, this was not the case. After being hired to liberate a psion from a high security prison and keep him alive, Buckaroo's weed smoking and grog drinking days got a lot busier. \n\nThe psion, \"Corban Ross\" to be specific, was a pretty lax, inconspicuous dude. Emphasis on the inconspicuous.\n\nLike:\n\nMan 1: \"Greetings, have you seen [description of Corban Ross] around?\"\n\nMan 2: \"Dude, I think you just described the three hundred people down the road at the markets.\" \n\nThat kind of inconspicuous. Anyway, Corban and Buckaroo had hired an almost uncanny Crocodile Dundee impersonator to assist them in making some money, just to survive. This Crocodile Dundee impersonator (He really would have insisted otherwise, but he's 2 sectors away so screw that guy,) named Jackal was not your usual competent mercenary. In fact you could almost say he was incompetent. Entirely incompetent. Oh my lord, he's so incompetent. \n\nOnto the story at hand. The three vagabonds were hired by the scouts, a for-hire military company that wanted them to do... Uh... They weren't actually sure what they were meant to be doing, they were all coming down from the narcotics they had been vigorously abusing the night before on the very Rasta-esque spaceship they were travelling on. But they had the orders written down on a piece of paper somewhere...\n\nThe scouts graciously loaned a ship to the unlikely heroes (I'm not sure why I wrote that, these guys were just arseholes, really) to take them to their mission. \n\nWell they packed their belongings onto the ship and sat down on the bridge of the ship, took their seats and readied their departure. \n\n\"Just a heads up mates, I'm not sure if I can bloody remember how to pilot a ship, but I'll give it me tops.\" Jackal blurted out, kicking the ship into speed.\n\nBuckaroo's eyes widened, \"Wait what do you mean by--,\" he was cut off suddenly by an ear splitting scraping sound as the spaceship grinded against the side of the space station.\n\n\"It's hunky dory, I got this,\" Jackal claimed as he chucked the ship into reverse, followed by another grinding sound, this one accompanied by a CRUNCH sound. \"No, still got this, I promise.\" CRUNCH. \"Nope still fine mattes,\" SCRAPE. \"We're all okay,\" CRUNCH. The ship groaned painfully and then there was a snap sound as something probably important fell off and the ship suddenly burst away from the space station.\n\"There we go. Just needed a bit of a push, right fellas?\" Jackal laughed as he swerved the ship around away from the station and into space. Buckaroo wiped some sweat from his brow and took a long sip from his bottle of wine.\n\nFinally, on course. The location was quite a distance away, so the crew would have to use the Jump-drive to get there. A Jump-Drive was some special space technology that allowed ships to travel across large distances in short periods of time. A jump usually took about a week. Jackal started to plot the jump to the mining colony where the group needed to go (they read that piece of paper) to protect a very expensive meteor. Plotting a jump required many calculations and precise planning, which of course wasn't on Jackal's skill list.\n\n\"Whoops, I think I might have mis-plotted the jump,\" he sung moments after he had started the jump, as Buckaroo and Corban both rubbed their brow in disappointment. Yet what should've they expected from the amount of money they paid Jackal. \n\nBuckaroo un-belted himself and stood up, heading towards the Engine room to realign the jump.\n\n\"I think I might be able to fix this, man.\" He claimed as he left.\n\n...\n\n...\n\n... \n\n...\n\nHe couldn't. Well, he could have. But he didn't. Because Buckaroo was the smartest moron on the ship. He sat back down next to Corban on the bridge and strapped himself in.\n\n\"All should be in check. Your miscalculations were pretty outrageous, but I did my best to fix them.\" He lied, as he reported his efforts. He leaned close to Corban and whispered \"It's ALL Jackal's fault. How could be possibly calculate a jump so badly?\"\nCorban had believed him completely. Then he leaned back into his seat and pushed the memories of going into the Engine room, stumbling around and breaking things and spilling wine into the electrical panel on the jump drive and then attempting to put out the fire with more wine. Yeah... Those memories are best left forgotten. \n\nThe ship entered jump-space. They wouldn't know whether Buckaroo's realignment would save them until they exited jump space. As stated previously, a jump usually takes around 7 days and covers a distance of 1 parsec of space. \n\nThe boys went to relax for the week. Corban trained his psionic abilities, Buckaroo fiddled with his robot, Banzai, and stole non-mandatory electronics and metals from the ship to upgrade it. That was probably a bad idea in retrospect. Jackal sort of just sat around, I suppose. He wasn't a very mentally active person. \n\nWell the seventh day came around and the group gathered in the bridge, waiting patiently to come out of Jump-space. And waited. Hm. Yeah they actually waited a while, but it never happened. They all talked about it and thought they might have miscounted the days which was moronic because they had clocks, but they went to bed and left it to the next day to worry about. \n\nWell a few days later and the worrying started to set in...\n\nThen a week after that, the panic set in. \n\nIt was only 5 days after that before they started to contemplate suicide, but before the dreaded suicide pact was made, they exited jump space. Holy shit, 3 weeks in jump space. That ISN'T good. Buckaroo rushed to the bridge and checked the star maps to find out where they had ended up. \n\n\"Well shit.\"\n\nCorban and Jackal came over to look as Buckaroo explained the new location. \n\n\"It seems we jumped in the wrong direction. Not just 3 parsecs in the wrong direction, like the 3 weeks would suggest, but in fact... 18 parsecs in the wrong direction. Whoops. Look at the bright side. 2 more parsecs and we would have ended up jumping into the empty black void of open space with no fuel, no merchant lanes to call for help from or planets to jump to.\" He explained, laughing nervously at the end. \n\n\"Well then what the fuck do we do now? We've failed the mission, that's for sure.\" Corban added. They were expected back around a week ago. \"I suppose we best make the most of it. Let's head to the closest planet and contact the scouts.\"\n\nJackal climbed into the pilots seat and chugged it towards the closest planet, the ship running dangerously low on fuel. They passed through security and zoomed into orbit at overly high speeds. So high that they couldn't decelerate enough in time. Jackal pulled the flight stick back suddenly to prevent crashing, but failed as they landed very suddenly on the belly of the ship, the hull taking the significant part of the impact. \n\nLuckily for seatbelts, they all survived, unscathed. They headed to the airlock and exited to check the damage. The door opened and bullets whizzed past them. They were in the middle of a gunfight. A bullet popped directly into Buckaroo's chest and bounced off his armour. He took some evasive maneuvers, jumping out of the ship and rolling down the ramp onto the ground at the bottom. It sounded like a good idea at the time, I promise.\n\nCorban shouted at Buckaroo to get back into the ship, and they gave him cover fire as he sprinted back up the ramp and inside. He slammed the airlock closed and they all booked it to the bridge, while the ship took fire from the gang outside.\n\nJackal jumped into the pilot seat and started the ship and took off expertly, avoiding the obstacles of the high-rise buildings, refueled at the space station and left the system to go back home...\n\n....\n\nNah, I'm kidding, he's Jackal. There was a deafening crunch as the ship pulled backwards into a building, crushing a few people who were out the front. He pulled back on the stick and the ship's nose pulled upwards suddenly and also smashed against the building, the ship now pointing directly upwards. He slammed on the accelerator as the whole city heard the grinding and crunching of the ship smashing the building and sliding upwards, breaking every window on the way up, until it got to the top and flew upside down over the rooftop and slid down the opposite side, headed directly for the ground, yet his instincts kicked in and he missed the first obstacle in his life as he spun the ship up and into the air once more. \n\nCorban jumped out of his seat, pulled Jackal from the pilot seat and jumped in, taking the flight stick and giving his best attempt at flying from the gangfire and towards the space station. He had less training than Jackal, yet he flew without crashing to the station. It was a miracle. The ship barely held together by the incompetence of three morons, they landed, got out and headed inside.\n\nThey contacted the scouts who were very upset with the mission failure and the ship crashing. They paid for repairs under the condition that Jackal and the crew return the ship to it's original sector, intact. Due to some conniving diplomacy when they took the mission, Corban and Buckaroo were not legally bound to the scout's contract. Only Jackal was.\n\nAfter they got off the conference call with the scouts, Buckaroo looked to Jackal with a look of feigned sadness. \"Hey buddy... Uhh.. We're not going with you. We uh.. We... need to...\" He stopped and thought for a few moments for a good excuse not to accompany the worst pilot in history. \"Hm, nope, I've got nothing. We're just not coming. Yeah, that's a good excuse.\" He said, smiling to himself. They walked off and left Jackal at the ship.\n\nHe looked around. He had no money and a ship with a crew capacity of 6 to pilot 18 parsecs home. He got in, and scraped out of the docking bay and took off. Buckaroo and Corban never saw him again, not sure if he successfully made the 18 jumps home. But since he colossally failed his first jump, they deducted he would be dead within the hour.\n\nSo they headed to the cafeteria, sat down and at some fucking delicious curds and whey and had a laugh over Jackal's incompetency. \n\nHa. Haha. Hahahahahaaaahahaha. Oh god we're so poor, we barely could afford the shitty space cafeteria food.\n\n(Okay that's it, go home. I've got RSI from writing and I already know I'll only get 2 upvotes and 3 downvotes so best not waste the rest of my time writing unless you guys enjoy the adventures of Buckaroo and Corban. Thanks for reading!)",

The gift is taking us from a medium level (5) to the highest level (20). It also comes with a few hundred thousand GP to buy stuff, and angel wings. So we go back to the world, now flooded with demons from an evil plane, and we just start destroying everything. We kill the boss that killed us in a few hits, and we get to the new final boss.

He runs at me. He rolls a 20. I shit my pants. He rolls another 20 to confirm. Iamsofucked. It's not over though. I spent most of my god money on armour that negates crit effects 75% of the time. All I have to do is not roll a 1 on my D4. You know what happened. I roll the fucking one. I get my head cut off. My other two party members are a wizard and a cleric. These guys have no AC and like 50hp. They somehow manage to defeat the boss without me by running in circles around the room shooting spells behind their heads. Game ends. I did absolutely nothing.",

        "text": "Co-written by both /u/thestartrekkerdude and I, this story chronicles the events of a game I DM'd where we went through the module We Be Goblins Too.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the land of Varisia, one of the most well-known feature of the Sandpoint Hinterlands is the bustling town of Sandpoint. Today’s story is not about Sandpoint.  Outside of that town, there lives a number of goblin tribes scattered throughout the Hinterlands, and it is there, among these goblins, that our tale begins.  However, we only really care about two of those tribes: The Licktoads and the Birdcrunchers.  Well, one, actually.  The Licktoad tribe was recently burned and razed to the ground by an unknown group of adventurers in an unfortunate turn of events that really isn’t that interesting in the grand scheme of things.\n \nIt is from this tribe that we no longer care about due to their non-existence that our group of four goblin adventurers hail from.  They were out looking for fireworks (also known by their more official term, “boom-boom sticks”) and so survived their tribe’s destruction.  The goblins in this noble band of four are as follows: \n\nReta Bigbad is a female fighter, wearing her signature wedding veil on her unusually large head. \n\nChuffy Lickwound, the male rogue, has a rather extraordinary case of acne and facial boils that he insists are absolutely normal.  \n\nPoog, the male cleric, worships Zarongel, the sacred god of dog-killing, fire, and most holy mounted combat.  Unfortunately Poog is rather bad at mounted combat, so rarely attempts it.  \n\nLastly we have Mogmurch the male alchemist, who is currently busy thanking his lucky stars that his mate was killed along with the other Licktoads.  Now he can live life to his heart’s content without her constantly nagging him about silly ideas, like eating one’s prey before exploding them.\n \nIn order to start a new life, the group travels to where they are pretty sure the Birdcruncher tribe lives, just east of Sandpoint in an area of rugged hills known as Ravenroost.  When they arrive they discover that the Birdcrunchers are cowering around the entrance to their main cave.  As more and more of the goblins inside the cave begin to realize that there are visitors, they start to form a crowd at the entrance of the cave.  A wrinkled old goblin woman waddles to the front of the crowd and introduces herself as Wise Mummy Sprattleharsh.  It turns out that the Birdcrunchers are currently without a chieftain, and it becomes clear that Sprattleharsh is the de facto leader in their absence.\n \nThe three previous chieftains all went to challenge a local ogre, named Pa Munchmeat, who has been terrorizing the Birdcrunchers as of late.  None of them have returned.  No one else wants to step forward and become chieftain now, since it would then be their responsibility to challenge Pa Munchmeat and avenge the previous chieftains.\n \nThankfully, our heroes aren’t ordinary goblins, and eagerly agree to take part in a Chieftain Moot, which is a series of challenges designed to find the next goblin who is worthy of being the new leader of the renowned Birdcrunchers in the storied lands of Ravenroost. In a series of events that were extremely improbable and horribly boring, Reta Bigbad narrowly emerged as the victor over her compatriots. She immediately appointed the other three group members of her troupe as sub-chieftains over the clan, as only goblins, apparently, can understand the concept of compromise in politics.\n \nAs the new chieftains, Reta’s party gains access to the Birdcrunchers’ cache of treasure, which, it turns out, is quite impressive.  Reta now wields a flaming dogslicer, while Chuffy takes up a cloak of elvenkind to improve his stealth.  Poog equips himself with a necklace of fireballs, a powerful magical item that he’s sure will come in handy somehow.  Mogmurch finds a couple of potions, a bead of force which he’s not too sure about, as well as 5 ounces of sovereign glue, which is quite possibly the strongest glue in the land.  Mogmurch isn’t sure what he’s going to do with it yet, but he knows he’ll come up with something eventually.\n \nThe next day, our four intrepid, adventuring goblins head out to Pa Munchmeat’s farm.  About three quarters of the way there, they come across a group of huckleberry bushes and stop briefly to eat a few.  As Reta reaches out to grab a few berries, she notices something looking at her through the bush.  Hungry eyes filled with murder stare back at her, and she barely has time to react as a massive boar covered in spiky steel armor charges through the bush and straight for Reta.  This is Pa Munchmeat’s pet, Piggy.  She’s hungry for goblin, and unbeknownst to the party, she’s just inhaled a Gourd of Fire-Burping.\n \nReta and the other goblins surround the boar as fast as they can while the boar lets loose with a 15-foot cone of roaring fire.  Reta briefly catches fire, but puts it out quickly.  Her wedding veil is now charred, and Reta’s vision turns an angry red hue as she unsheathes her flaming dogslicer.  The boar continues its assault, repeatedly swiping at Reta with its huge tusks.  Poog and Mogmurch forget about their spells and bombs and swing madly at the boar, missing horribly.  As it turns out, our fighter and rogue fare little better, as they also wildly miss the gigantic boar that stands stationary directly in front of them (boars are somehow more adept at camouflage than the broad sides of barns, it would seem). Her eyes filled with hate for this stupid little goblin and her pointy fire stick, Piggy continues her relentless assault on Reta, barely noticing the others. Piggy gets one solid attack as she drives one of her tusks through Reta’s upper arm.  Reta screams, and retaliates by taking her flaming dogslicer and driving it straight through Piggy’s fleshy throat, right between the plates of her armor.  \n\nIn a moment of unparallelled genius, Mogmurch suddenly remembers that he has bombs; he promptly steps back, and throws one of his bombs straight at Piggy.  The bomb hits perfectly and explodes, sending Piggy to the ground, howling in pain.  Reta and Poog are also damaged from the bomb, but now Reta has tasted blood, and she wants more.  Reta holds her flaming dogslicer high above her and mightily carves it through the flesh exposed and raw from the explosion, ripping out the still-beating heart of the mighty boar and eating it whole in the deft movements of one fell stroke. Inspired by the genius of Mogmurch, Poog also remembers that he has skills other than direct melee combat. With Piggy slain, he promptly heals the party, giving special attention to the massive hole in Reta’s arm.\n\nTo be continued in [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/342mk0/pathfinder_we_be_goblins_part_2_heart_of_the/)",

        "text": "Hey all! So this roleplay takes place almost immediately after the last one. The Dragonkin player is still asleep at the table so the DM kept it with he's knocked out still (and still draped over Omegas shoulders)\n\n---start---\nTitus raised his torch into the dark passage. The stench of decay wafted through the visor on his helmet, he cleared his throat in an attempt to pass the smell away from his nostrils. \"This way Grethor.\" he said clearly. \"The passage grows wider here.\" he added pointing with his free hand to the wall.\nGrethor scanned the dimly lit passageway, \"Be careful lad.\" he said wisely, \"There may be more than dead bodies waiting down here.\" he continued in a hushed tone. A clash of metal stirred him from his train of though, \"You ok back there Omega?\" he asked over his shoulder.\nOmega nodded, \"Omega is ok.\" he said as shuffled the dragonkin over his shoulders. \"Dragon keeps leaking over me.\" he paused, \"Is he hurt again?\"\nGrethor chuckled, \"No lad.\" he began, \"He's just slobbering on you.\" he explained carefully. \"Nothing to worry about.\" he finished chuckling to himself before kicking a rock away from the path. \"Mind your step lad.\" he added.\n\nOmega continued to walk behind the party. Grethor hadn't wanted the construct to be in front of anyone on the off chance they sprung a trap or were ambushed. He knew the strength of the construct was his great martial prowess and that he could turn the tides rapidly.... but first he had to lose the dragonkin and that would cause a mess for the followers behind him. Omega heard Draketis snort in his slumber. The giant beast rested on Omega as they made their way through.\n\nTitus stopped the party. \"Halt friends.\" he said, \"There is nowhere left to go.\" he added as the party reached a seemingly desolate room.\nGrethor stepped forwards past the hesitant knight, \"Remember lad, the quietest cave tells the most secrets.\" he said as he began to scan the room. \"Light the torches, we need to find a way to get past this door.\" he said as he pointed to a patch of the wall not covered in moss.\nTitus lifted his visor with a wide smile, \"Well spotted Sir.\" he complimented. \"This door was opened recently it seems.\" he continued, \"We should be wary of whatever it was that opened it though.\" he finished apprehensively.\n\nGrethor nodded, \"Ok lads.\" he paused, \"and lasses.\" he added nodding at Preeta and Grendell the Archer (OOC - Got the names of the bard and Archer mixed up in my previous story!) \"Somehow this door opens. So let's see if we can find a way in!\" he commanded with enthusiasm.\nOmega smiled, it was an inspiring sight for the construct seeing the wizard so enthusiastic about his party, \"Omega put Draketis down now?\" He asked enthusiastically.\n\n\"Yes lad.\" Grethor replied, \"Be careful not to bump his head again though.\" he added with a chuckle.\nOmega nodded and lowered the slumbering giant gently to the floor. He rested his head against the wall before joining the party in looking for something to open the door with.\nTitus turned to see Omega crawling on the floor lad, \"Ok down there Omega?\" he joked, \"Shout if you see anything.\"\nOmega nodded and continued his search. He scanned the cracks between the floor blocks and looked for abnormalities in the paving. Omega paused and leapt to his feet. Titus turned to meet his gaze, \"What is it lad? Did you find something?\"\n\nOmega scratched his chin as he had seen Grethor do many times before. \"What is Omega meant to be looking for again?\" he asked inquisitively.\nGrethor snorted a laugh, \"A switch or raised platform that might open the door for us lad.\" he said laughing. \"Anything that looks irregular or out of place.\"\n\nThe construct looked around the room, \"Like this?\" he said excitedly pointing into the corner of the room.\nTitus moved to the area the construct was pointing at and held his torch against the shadows, as the light passed over the shadows a grey raised stone graced the party with it's presence for the first time. \"Well i'll be.\" the knight said in amazement.\nOmega jumped in excitement, \"Omega found it!\" he said to himself.  He turned to Grethor, \"May Omega press it?\" he asked the wizard.\n\nGrethor looked around the room, \"Yes lad. But be careful. It might not be the one we're looking for.\"\nOmega ignored the last part, he crouched in the corner and pushed the heavy stone button down. With a grinding crash of stone and steel the doorway opened and a pathway once again lead into darkness.\n\nTitus smiled, \"Well done Omega.\" he said to the construct. Omega smiled and waved.\n\"We go adventure again now friends?\" the construct asked excitedly.\nGrethor shook his head, \"Not yet lad.\" he said slowly, scratching his beard as he examined the doorway. \"It might be a trap still.\"\nOmega nodded slowly, \"That would be a bad thing wouldn't it?\" he questioned in a tone of understanding. \"How do we check if it is a trap?\" he added before a noise behind him broke his concentration.\n\nPreeta shuffled past the party, the tome still clutched in her hands. \"I have an idea.\" she said meekly as she looked down at the tome, \"I could ask Krathul to check.\" she added as the tome rumbled. \"He can't be hurt by traps as he's too powerful.\" she commented wisely as the tome stopped rumbling.\nGrethor raised an eyebrow, \"and he would be ok with this?\" he asked slowly.\nPreeta nodded, \"He's so powerful nothing can hurt him so he can't be stopped.\" she said confidently adding with a wink.\nGrethor smiled, \"Ok lass let's give it a go.\" he said smiling at the girls clever choice of words.\n\nPreeta opened the book and silently began mouthing an incantation, Omega watched with eager eyes as a trail of crystal dust poured down the spine of the book onto the floor. Slowly the dust span and weaved itself into the shape of Krathul. The crystalline construct stretched and cracked its head from side to side. Krathul looked at Omega with a gentle nod, \"Construct.\" he said sternly. Omega waved excitedly. Krathul turned his head to Preeta. \"What does it want this time?\" He asked in his deep echoing voice.\n\nPreeta smiled and closed the tome. \"Krathul we need you to make sure that there are no traps ahead.\" she pointed to the doorway.\nKrathul laughed, \"It doesn't even ask anymore it just expects me to do it.\" he spoke in a mocking tone. \"Maybe I won't.\"\nPreeta broke the smile, \"Krathul. Check that doorway for me.\" she said sternly in her commanding tome.\nKrathul turned on the spot, \"Vile cur.\" he spat before walking to the doorway. Omega shifted uncomfortably on the foot pressed down on the stone. Krathul often spoke to Omega when Preeta had allowed him out for the nightwatch. For some reason Krathul tolerated Omega despite the constructs knowledge of controlling him. Omega didn't like it when Krathul was spoken to like a dog, it reminded him of the training camps recruits who often shouted insults at the construct.\n\nKrathul looked around the doorway and scanned the low light areas. He took a few steps in and saw nothing of danger. He turned to the party as he stepped back into the doorway. \"It is clear of traps.\" he grunted.\nOmega leapt forwards to check the pathway. With a loud crash the door closed again crushing Krathul as Omega stepped off the button. The party stopped in their tracks as the giant boulder slid into place and crystalline dust flew everywhere.\n\nTheir silence was broken by Krathul with a roar of defiance as he reassembled himself. \"WHAT TRICKERY IS THIS?\" he screamed, pointing to Omega. \"You try to destroy me construct?\" he boomed at Omega.\nOmega shook his head in fear, \"No Krathul!\" he cried nervously. \"Omega didn't know about the door!\" he shook.\nPreeta shouted, \"Krathul RETURN!\" she screamed as she flung open the book.\nWith a blinding light from the tome Krathul slowly broke into dust and flew into the tome. He glared at omega for as long as he could before being dragged into the tome. With a loud clap Preeta closed the tome and returned the room to darkness.\nGrethor turned to Omega, \"You ok lad?\" he said to the still shivering construct.\nOmega looked at grethor. \"Omega didn't mean it.\" he said nervously, \"Krathul still friend yes?\" he said panicking.\nGrethor nodded, \"I'm sure he will get over it in time lad.\" he said to the construct. \"Let's just worry about how we're gonna keep the door open.\" he finished as he turned to the switch.\n\nTitus examined the switch and withdrew his shield. With steady hands he placed it on the switch. The door etched slightly and the switch lowered an inch. \"All we have to do is get enough weight to get through.\" he said.\nGrethor scratched his beard, \"It's a clever idea.\" he commented, \"You have to weight the door down with whatever you can spare.\" he added turning to the knight. \"Think your armour weighs enough?\" he said to Titus.\n\nThe knight removed his helmet and scratched his head, \"Yeah of course it does.\" he paused, \"But that would leave me without anything to defend myself with.\" he said slowly before cracking a smile. \"Whoever designed this place wanted intruders to lose their stuff as they got deeper into it.\" he picked up the shield from the switch, noting as it slid back into place and the door returned to it's neutral position. \"What happened to the last groups weight though?\" he questioned.\n\nGrethor scratched his beard. \"The last group saw the switch weighed down by treasure and grabbed it.\" he commented, \"the door shut and they ran with the treasure.\" he added, \"the gold was left from the group before that who went deeper to look for more.\" he smiled. \"Greedy bastards.\" he chuckled.\nTitus looked back to the wizard, \"What shall we do then?\" he asked.\n\nOmega watched as the knight and the wizard weighted up ideas. Cogs whirred in his mind as he put two and two together. He stepped past the two and made his way to the sleeping dragonkin.\n\nGrethor saw the construct out of the corner of his eye, he turned back to Titus. \"Perhaps we can grab the remains of the altar and use them?\" he asked.\nTitus shook his head, \"It's sandstone.\" he began, \"It won't hold weight without crumbling and it would likely just clog the mechanism.\" he spoke.\n\"Watch backs friends!\" Omega called out.\nTitus and Grethor turned to see Omega with the dragonkin over his shoulders rushing to the corner. Grethor scratched his beard while Titus raised an eyebrow.\n\nOmega knelt and lowered the dragonkin over the switch. The sleeping giant slumped over and rested his head on the wall. Omega shifted his body using the deadweight onto the pressure point. Once again the door lowered.\nOmega looked to Grethor, \"Draketis is heavy enough!\" he said with excitement. Titus smiled at the construct.\n\"Well done Omega.\" he complimented, \"But what happens when he wakes up?\" he finished in a concerned tone.\nOmega looked back at the Dragonkin before turning to Titus, \"Omega suggest we finish what we are doing quickly.\" he responded smiling.\n\nGrethor chuckled, \"Good idea lad!\" he shouted with a cheer, \"Pick up those torches lads and lassies!\" he proclaimed. \"We're going in!\"\n\n---end---",

        "text": "A long time ago, in an RPG far far away..\n\nThe campaign took place during the Clone Wars.  The heroes, a Jedi leading a squad of clones, and two other players, were called to an outer rim planet that was loyal to the Republic for help.  Their main city had been under siege and was about to fall.  \n\nThe heroes showed up and saw the damage to the city.  The shield was gone with many of the walls were damaged.  All offense weapons were kaput.  After a harsh battle to drive back enemy forces, the heroes had a night to prepare for the next wave.  After inspection they had discovered a huge gun turret that had been used to take out ships that flew over the city several decades before this particular seige.  One of our heroes was determined that he could fix it, even though the DM repeated many times that it was next to impossible--it had just taken too much damage over the years it had been in service.  But much to the dismay of the DM, he rolled a natural 20 and repaired it.  That wasn't enough though, to try and prevent this thing from being used to ruin the DM's plans he claimed that the targeting system was shot. It was working to the point where it received power and turned on, sure, but without the targeting there wasn't any way to actually use it.  No problem.  He was sure he could fix that too.  Believe it or not, a second natural 20 was rolled.  The DM couldn't believe it but couldn't do anything else to stop it.  The guy literally fixed a giant gun turret over night.\n\nThis gun was so powerful that it one-shotted any flying machine that got anywhere near the city, thus ending any kind of bombing missions that the enemy forces were doing, allowing the city workers and heroes more time to repair the walls and take back the city, while the clones and Jedi fought the ground troops.  This went on for a few sessions but eventually the city was saved.  The shields were repaired, the enemy was forced to retreat and give up their assault.  They had saved the city and reinforced that the Republic was the right group to back.\n\nTo celebrate, the city threw a party that lasted for two days and nights.  When the party was over the heroes, all but the Jedi, hung-over and exhausted, climbed back aboard their ship to leave.  The shields were lowered, the ship lifted up and was heading for orbit......when BOOM!  \n\nThe gun turret hadn't been deactivated and it critically hit the ship, causing it to immediately fall out of the sky and crash.\n\nLesson learned.",

        "text": "I've wanted to share this story for a while but I wasn't sure how to write it. I'll just share the basics of what's happened so far without doing too much of a narrative.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe game is called the End of the World and like I said you play as yourself, creating traits and stats that accurately reflect who you are as a person. My group is currently five people strong. Wes is a big intimidating guy who could easily pass for a biker with his several tattoos. His wife is Heather, a likable girl who loves animals and is studying to be a vet. AJ is a goofy guy with a masters in history. My girlfriend is Eva, a swimmer and a runner who loves bunnies and has a degree in computer science. As for myself, I'm Kelly a former Marine with a degree in biology. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe end of the world hits on a Friday night while we're all at Wes's house playing a card game called Netrunner. A body falls part way through the home's front window and something heavy begins pounding at We's front door. AJ decides to use his body to block the door from being caved in and Wes runs to his bedroom to grab a few weapons. I grab a meat cleaver from the kitchen. When Wes returns he hands me a .357 magnum and we use a side door to investigate who or what is attacking the house. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThey're zombies. Not the shambling kind either, the 28 days later kind. The game master, Greg says that we can see a gaggle of them sprinting towards the house from a field about a 100 yards away. I pull the body that fell through the window out of the house and Wes sinks a machete into its face. The zombie at the door has burst through and is attacking the girls, even after AJ threw a chair at it. Somehow they make it out of the side door before any damage is done and we pile into two cars. The girls and I make to Eva's eco-friendly hatchback while Wes and AJ jump into AJ's sedan. Eva is the first to make it down the long country road where Wes resides and finally turns on to the now abnormally busy four lane highway. She is immediately T-boned by a car but due to lucky dice rolling no one is seriously injured. \n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nAs we're on the highway we decide to head towards our college campus where several of us are employed. I work in computer networking and have access to an area called the server room. Its the climate controlled hub of our campus network and its behind two, heavy, card access doors. Between the two door is a small area called a man trap that houses keys to several vehicles and every building on campus. We are completely aware that heading into campus may be more dangerous but we feel that the benefits outweigh the dangers. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe are in communication with each other via cell phones. We have decided to exit the highway and are now taking the back roads on our trek to the college. We reason that traffic will be reduced as will any potential encounters with zombies or survivors.As we near the city we approach a relatively normal looking gas station, one that Wes is familar with and patronizes frequently. He and Eva get into a small argument because he wants to stop and buy cigarettes but she threatens to leave he and AJ behind if they stop. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe pass the gas station without incident but our progress is blocked by a group of abandoned cars, forcing us into a mall parking lot. According to the game master we spy several shapes in the darkened parking lot who begin sprinting toward our direction. Our attention is so focused on the shapes in the dark that we don’t notice the other vehicle until it slams into AJ and Wes’s car. We were pretty upset at this because we had already been hit once and we’re questioning how we got into an accident in a parking lot. Evidently the other survivor's car came barreling around a corner and slammed into the drivers side of AJ’s car. Both vehicles come to a stop. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAJ is bleeding and Wes is furious. He takes his .45 and steps out of the car. I see this and step out of our car in order to provide him cover. I don’t know what Wes is going to do but I fear he’s going to hurt these people in a fit of rage. I attempt to use my charisma to calm him down and fail miserably. He takes the butt of his gun and breaks out the stranger’s driver’s side window.  He is made marginally calmer when he notices that both passengers are unconscious. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe shadowy shapes in the parking lot have almost reached Wes and the stranger’s car but he doesn't notice as he’s too busy breaking their window. I get lucky with a headshot and bring one of the shapes down. I yell at Wes to get back in his car and he reluctantly complies but only after taking a bag from the stranger’s car. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEva is beginning to get frantic and yells that we have to go. Heather has a problem just leaving the two people to die. Wes says, “Fuck ‘em” and the matter is settled. We drive away as the shapes reach the strangers car and start to devour the occupants. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe cross an overpass choked with abandoned cars and scattered bodies. Luckily both of our vehicles are able to pass without incident and we are less than two miles from the campus. We begin to head down a small street on the southeastern edge of campus. This street is home to two bars, one that I frequent, and one of the largest four story dorms on campus. These two buildings are across the street from each other. Due to AJ being somewhat disoriented from his injury he actually stops at a stop sign at the four way intersection between the dorm and the bars. Before he can start again two zombies plow into his car. One begins tearing at the driver’s side door and another jumps on the hood of his sedan. Without thinking AJ revs his car into a telephone pole in an attempt to kill the zombie on his hood. I think this is funny despite the horrifying situation because its part of my job to maintain these telephone poles.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAJ’s engine shuts off completely but one of the zombies is pinned to the pole. Another one appears out of nowhere and breaks the glass on the passenger’s side where Wes is sitting. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMyself, Eva, and Heather are in Eva’s hatchback directly behind AJ and Wes watching this happen. I open the door and step out of the car in order to help Wes. Eva is screaming at me to get back in the car. I raise my pistol to shoot the runner harassing Wes but at the same time another figure hits Eva’s side of the car and partially opens her door. Without thinking she throws her car in reverse. This has two effects, throwing the zombie off her side of the vehicle and hitting me with my still open door. My first shot goes wide because Eva almost runs me over. Lucky dice rollings see me get to my feet and put three bullets into the zombie attacking Wes. Now given a small moment freedom Wes yells at Aj to get down so that he can’t put a bullet in the head of the zombie on AJ’s side of the car. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith a little luck we are able to get AJ’s car started. We are less than half a mile from the server room. \n\nI'm in the process of writing the next part. Hope you guys enjoy it.\n\nEdit: The next part has been added\n",

        "text": "The following took place in a one-off session held at the back of a bus during the ride home from a Latin convention. The normal party was all there, minus the sorcerer, and I had them play new temp characters as lieutenants in the undead army of Vice, newly minted Demon Princess of the Undead. Their individual identities and backstories were mostly references to the old days of the campaign (and one reference to Beowulf) and are not really important to the story. It's worth noting that in this session, because it was just a quick one-off, I played even faster and looser with the rules than I ever have before. Fun ensued.\n\nAny way, the session began with an assload of exposition about the ongoing civil war in the Nine Hells to claim the recently vacated throne of Asmodeus, King of Hell. It's all presently locked in a cluster-fucky stalemate when Vice and her army arrive to knock on the gates. The party is sent in separately from the main army to covertly infiltrate the realm and kill Bel, the Lord of the First Layer of Hell, Avernus. In order to accomplish this, Vice advised them to seek help from one of the four evil gods who make Avernus their home. She warned, however, that each would only agree to certain means of persuasion, and that she did not know what methods would work on which god. Therefore, Vice suggested that they barter for information with Bazzracath, my universe's friendly neighborhood bargain demon. \n\nThe group, as slaves, had nothing to offer Bazzracath, so they captured one of the damned souls residing in Avernus (whom they found in hiding after the skeletal healer critically succeeded to just know where he was) and traded that to the demon. This earned them some info about one of the resident gods, but when that didn't pan out after their cheese failed and they were unwilling to pay her price of sacrificing one of their own, the group went back to Bazzracath for more intel. This time, they wanted detailed primers on all the gods in Avernus, for which the demon asked a heavier price: a magical sheath, lost centuries ago by a hero who journeyed to Hell in hopes of saving his beloved's soul. The sheath had some very badass enchantments laid upon it, and Bazzracath demanded that the party find and bring it to him in exchange for the information. It was lost somewhere in the foothills on the other side of Hell, so I thought the party had a long search ahead of them. Then the rogue announces his intention to roll \"to pick it up.\" I explain that it is not anywhere near him and he could not, therefore, pick it up. He rolls.\n\nDouble god damn twenty, the motherfucker reaches down and picks the fucking sheath out of thin air. I sigh, and the party calls up Bazzracath to do the deal. He tells them what they want to know, and the party decides that the best course is to seek the help of the Kobold god Iforgothisbullshitnameguy, who is convinced to aid them after they agree to infiltrate the palace of Evenmoreridiculousfuckingnameguy, a Goblin deity, and snap his scepter of power in half, then shove the halves up the asses of two different goblins. With the help of Pass Without A Trace, Telekinesis, Silence, Time Stop, and me letting him cast all of these and more nonstop because he (like all the characters in this session) was deliberately overpowered beyond all reason, the group Lich manages to get the job done. With the Kobold deity's help, they raid Bel's fortress and utterly fucking annihilate him. As I said, OP as all fuck.\n\nFollowing this victory, Vice and her army conquer Avernus and bind all the damned souls on the layer to rotting corpses, nearly doubling the size of her forces with zombie foot soldiers. They then proceed to march on Dis, the second layer, where the Mad God has taken up residence in the body of Dispater, the Lord of Dis. As the army approaches his tower, Vice creates a shield of zombie torsos to protect her and her lieutenants from the incoming Wabbajack bolts let loose by the Mad God. I proceed to make 20 rolls on the Wabbajack table against random zombies, for no more than shits and giggles. Chuckles are had, nothing much of consequence happens, until two very important results are rolled: first, \"The target establishes a psychic link with the wielder and attempts to overpower their mind.\" Now, normally if this happened with a god as one of the participants, the deity would win automatically because \"Fuck you, I am a god.\" However, the zombie targeted by the bolt didn't have a mind of his own; he was enthralled by Vice. As such, I rule that Vice would make the roll, and as a demon princess she would be on a comparable level of psychic strength to that of the Mad God. The two roll opposed D20s, and Vice rolls an 11. The God of Madness rolls a 3.\n\nSo, essentially, the Mad God was now enslaved to the will of Vice, Demon Princess of the Undead. But that's not all, motherfuckers, because the Wabbajack bolts had all already been fired, and there were more to roll for. Hence, the second important roll, arriving on the last bolt of the Wabbajack: a 1. I rolled a D6, and it came up even. For those who've read my Wabbajack table, you know what that means: 1D8 safe, unrestricted wishes for the wielder. The D8 roll was a 6, so six wishes are bestowed upon the Mad God...who was enthralled by Vice. Which meant the wishes went to her.\n\nWhen all was said and done, Vice had used her wishes to become the undisputed Queen of the Nine Hells, kill both Mad Gods and claim their power whilst maintaining her sanity, kill Asmodeus so there would be no challengers to her throne, and make the Abyss safe again but sealed off to those who would not swear loyalty to her. And so Vice Blackbard, a tiefling bard and minor secret antagonist just days prior, had become Vice, Empress of Hell, Queen of the Abyss, and Goddess of Madness. That's...pretty much all there is to say about that.",

        "text": "So alot of people have been asking me what it's like to play an innocent character who see's everything as an adventure. Obviously at one point, we all thought like this when we were kids!\nhttp://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/childs-play - This game was made over 48 hours with an obscure theme. We wanted to capture that a child see's everything differently to how we see it.\nI drew alot of inspiration from my time as Omega when I helped build this so if you like Omega you're sure to like this!\n\nBut anyways back to the story! We broke for snacks and a chat once we got to the temple. We mentioned to the guy playing Draketis that the fun of the game comes from getting into the story and that combat might not be as exciting as he thought. As predicted he dismissed it and during a rather roleplay heavy scenario he fell asleep at the desk!\n\nHere is where Omegas innocence really shone out for me.\n\n---start---\nGrethor looked around the chamber of the tomb. He scratched his beard as a crack in the rocks let in enough sun to illuminate a ruined altar. He was sure that the majority of treasure had been ransacked from the crumbling structure and that the traps were most likely all sprung by fools with heavy steps. His aged eyes scanned the altar for clues that would assist them in their search. \"Omega. Come here a second lad.\" he said to the construct.\n\nOmega span on the spot startled. His broadsword clashing into the suit of ancient armour he was investigating sending it crashing to the floor. The party turned ready to attack before lowering their weapons again. Omega shyly stepped away, \"Omega sorry friends.\" he said meekly, \"Didn't mean to break statue.\" he added.\n\nThe bard laughed, \"It's ok buddy.\" he replied as he slid his dagger back into his belt. \"I'll have a look at it. Go see what Grethor wants.\" Omega nodded and walked quickly into the doorway where Grethor called from. \"Holy crap is this a bone?\" he heard the bard say to himself.\n\nGrethor motioned to Omega, \"Have a look at this lad.\" he said pointing to the altar. \"See anything that looks familiar?\"\nOmega looked around the room. His eyes adjusted to the darkness and he began scanning the altar. \"Omega doesn't see anything unusual.\" he said slowly, unsure if he was meant to see something that made sense. Grethor had begun to test the construct so he could make better choices by himself. \"Hold up!\" Omega said sharply. He had begun to pick up phrases from the party in his travels. \"This one! This one!\" he shouted excitedly, pointing to a rune on the altar. \"Krathul taught Omega this one! It means...\" he paused unable to recall the right term. \"The way in?\" he asked nervously.\n\nGrethor smiled, \"Do you mean entrance?\" he asked kindly.\nOmega nodded, \"Yes. Entrance. This means Entrance.\" he looked back at the altar, \"Omega not sure where though. Some runes are missing.\" he added as he looked back to the wizard, \"Omega didn't break it did I?\" he asked nervously.\nGrethor shook his head, \"No lad. Some treasure hunters probably beat us here.\" He wiped some dust off his cloak, \"I'm gonna wager that they didn't make it out though.\" he added as he walked towards the wall and began feeling. \"Likely means there is a door around here somewhere.\" he finished.\n\nOmega looked at the wall, he knew the wizard was teaching him to check the wall without asking him to do it. Omega saw a crack in the seemingly perfect wall, \"Grethor. There's a crack here.\" he said as he stepped towards the wall. \"Maybe we can force it open?\" he asked.\n\nGrethor chuckled, \"I'm a bit too old to open a wall with strength. Get our new friend and titus to give you a hand.\" he pointed to the other chamber.\nOmega nodded and scurried from the room quickly. \"Titus!\" Omega squealed excitedly, \"Grethor has a mission for us!\"\nThe knight raised his visor and placed his shield on his back. \"Really Omega?\" he asked, \"What does he want us to do?\"\nOmega pointed at the giant dragonkin picking his teeth with his claws. \"We have to get Draketis to help as well. Need to open a secret door!\" he said. \"Need strong people!\"\nDraketis snorted, \"Feeble cretins.\" he grunted as he got to his feet. \"I need no assistance!\" he added rudely as he walked past the knight and Omega and into the chamber the wizard was in.\n\"Hey look I got his head back on!\" the bard said from behind them. Titus shook his head and lowered his visor again before patting the construct on the shoulder and walking into the room the Dragonkin had gone into. Omega followed excitedly being careful not to knock anything over again.\n\nGrethor turned to the giant creature entering the room. \"Oh there you are Draketis.\" he said pleasantly, \"Mind your head lad!\" he added chuckling to himself as Draketis ducked under the beam of the doorway.\n\"What is it sorcerer.\" Draketis spat through his fangs. \"The construct sent for me and the knight.\" he added viciously.\n\"Well lad, we've found a secret way into where we need to go.\" the wizard spoke softly. Ignoring the tone of the beast, \"Just need you three lads to knock it down so we don't get trapped in case of a booby trap.\"\nOmega chuckled behind the dragonkin before Titus tapped his chest and shook his head. Grethor chuckled, \"Oh good! You're all here!\" he raised his palm to his staff and whistled gently. A ball of light slowly flew into his hand from his staff before raising gently to the top of the room illuminating it brightly. \"This should help you.\"\n\nOmega stood in awe at the new trick Grethor pulled from his seemingly endless bag. Grethor smiled, \"Sorry I didn't do that earlier lad. Just wanted to see if your eyes were working.\" he added with a wink.\n\nTitus looked to the point of the wall with a crack in. \"It seems that the seam on the door is light enough for us to slip a sword into it. Maybe we can find the bolt and unhook it enough to get through.\" he said as he lowered his visor again.\n\nGrethor smiled, \"Your eyes are alot better than mine lad.\" he said scratching his beard. \"Maybe you can pull the door and open it first?\" he added.\nTitus shook his head. \"Grethor your mind is clearer than mine it seems.\" he replied. \"Omega, Draketis. If you would help me with this please.\" he said as he took a step towards the door.\n\nDraketis roared in defiance, \"I do not need lesser life forms assistance!\" he shouted and stomped towards the door. Knocking titus to the ground as he stormed past. Omega picked the Knight up and dusted his armour off.\n\"Titus alive?\" he asked nervously attempting to look into the eyeslots of the knights great helm.\nTitus nodded, \"I'm okay.\" he said sternly, \"Omega when someone might be hurt you ask them if they are alright.\" he added slowly. \"If they are dead they will not answer you.\" he finished.\nOmega looked at his hands, \"Is Omega half right then?\" he asked in a confused tone.\nGrethor laughed, \"You'll have to break it down more than that Titus.\" the wizard said.\nTitus raised his visor again and looked at Omega. \"Alright means not hurt or ill. It's like saying I am unhurt and able to continue.\" he explained with a smile. \"Does that make sense?\"\nOmega turned to the knight and put a hand on his shoulder. \"When friends joke. They tend to make a silly observation look serious.\" he explained in a serious tone.\nTitus opened his mouth in shock as Grethor began laughing once again. \"The lad got you!\" the wizard cried out. \"Well played my boy.\" he finished as he wiped the tears from his eyes. Titus lowered his visor and patted Omega on the shoulder. Omega smiled and turned to the door with the knight.\n\nThe Dragonkin sunk his claws into the centuries old tomb door and began pulling with all his might. Slowly the door moved and rocks crumbled. Titus raised his shield above Grethor in case of a cave in. He turned to Omega who was gaping at the giants strength. As the door moved more and more the dragonkin tightened his grip and dug his claws in more and more.\n\nOmega was awoken from his daze by a deafening crash. The Dragonkin stumbled as the door crumbled onto him. His claws tearing further into the stone causing more to break off. Piece by piece crashed against his unprotected skull before the door stopped moving and the lumbering giant lay under a pile of rocks. The smell of dragon blood filled the air as well as the stench of decay from the newly opened gap in the wall.\n\nGrethor nodded at Titus who lowered his shield. \"That lads, is why we do stuff together.\" he said dryly. \"Someone fetch Bartil and get Draketis checked.\" he said with little remorse.\nOmega stepped carefully around the wreckage to the pile of rubble, \"Omega move rocks?\" he asked nervously. Grethor merely nodded as the construct removed piles of rocks from the unconcious Dragonkin. \"Draketis, you alive?\" he asked quietly. A muffled laugh came from Titus as the final rock was moved. Draketis looked almost peaceful as he lay on the floor.\n\n\"You boys make more of a racket than I do at my local brothel.\" Bartil the Bard commented as he walked in. \"You'd know all about that wouldn't you pal.\" he said to Omega with a wink. Omega looked nervously around the room, at their last stop over Omega had heard Bartil yelling in pain with mixed groans of others. Fearing he was in trouble Omega barged the door down and ran in sword in hand..... to Find Bartill in bed with 2 women and another man.\n\nBartill smiled, \"Don't worry lad. I didn't mid.\" he said with another wink. \"Where's the patient?\" he said dryly.\nGrethor pointed to the corner of the room, \"Taking a nap lad. Just let us know if he'll survive.\"\nBartill walked to the sleeping dragonkin and cleaned the skull wound. Omega watched as the Bard wiped the cut clean and removed some fabric from his bag before wrapping it around the beasts head. He wiped the dust off his hands and patted the sleeping Dragonkins shoulder before standing up and walking back to the wizard whistling.\n\n\"Nothing major.\" he chirped. \"Poor guy just knocked himself out cold.\" he chuckled. \"He'll be right as rain in a bit. Think his prides gonna take a bigger hit than anything.\"\nGrethor nodded, \"We'll be sure to dock his wages for the sleeping time.\" he said sarcastically. \"Come on lads that tome has got to be around here somewhere.\" he added merrily as he motioned to the open doorway.\n\nOmega pointed at Draketis, \"What about him?\" he asked. \"Grethor you said that the last people didn't make it out.\" he added, \"We can't leave friend behind.\" the construct said in a almost serious tone.\nGrethor looked at Omega, \"We can't carry him lad. He will slow us down.\" he replied with a slow tone. \"He didn't listen when I said we had to work together and acted on impulse.\" he added, \"Once we've got the tome we can come back for him.\" he finished.\nOmega shook his head, \"I can carry him.\" he replied in defiance, \"When Omega joined Omega promised to protect everyone in the party from harm.\" he adopted a serious tone again, \"Draketis had an accident. He didn't mean to hurt himself so he should not be punished.\" Omega pointed at the bard. \"Thats what Bartil said to me about my accident.\" The bard glowed scarlet. \"I can carry him, I don't get tired.\" Omega said with sincerity.\n\nGrethor smiled, \"I can't say no to you lad.\" he replied, \"But if I tell you to drop him and run for it with us.\" he added with a serious tone. \"You do it lad.\" he finished.\nOmega nodded, \"I understand.\" and shot Grethor a smile. \"Just make sure you run faster than Omega.\" he finished as he turned and picked up the sleeping giant.\n\nGrethor smiled, \"Always lad. Always.\"\n\n-- end of part 5 --\n\nHope you're all still enjoying this! Loving the response to Omega :)",

        "text": "IMPORTANT NOTICE: Unless you want to be confused, I recommend you read Part 1 before reading this one. Here's the link:  http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3372hm/add_my_totally_horrible_first_campaign_ever_part/  Go ahead, read up. I can wait.\n\nYou back? Good. How 'bout them kobolds, amirite? Anyway, let's continue...\n\nSo after we hit the halfway point following a trap that Matteo blocked, our DM revived us and gave us all our deities. Korgon got Hephaestus, Matteo got Hasteltsi, Daerra got Ki (some Sumerian war goddess), Matthias got Yamamoto Date, and Tenebros got some Chinese death god, Wen-Yang-Weh I think his name was.I dunno what the others in my group got.\n\nFirst trap we encounter after our resurrection (door trap, push it in and the ceiling caves in), one of my brother's characters fails his rolls and dies, while Matthias gets out fine. So brother had to go and explain why he deserved to get brought back to life to his deity. He got it, but his armor class and HP were lowered by about half. He got better after getting a nat-20 on a group of gnolls (two weapons, group attack was an option, at least the DM didn't say it *wasn't*) and gibbing them all. This was after my Orc took three (thankfully low-damage) hits. *I really need my own damn d20*, I'm thinking to myself, *DM's might look cool, but oh my GOD am I unlucky with them*.\n\nSo, brother's guy is back to normal, as is Matthias. I forget most of what happened next (this part being about 5 days ago and it being 2am at the time did us no favors, both in-game and out), save for a sword that nearly killed Daerra, again, that was needed for another puzzle, a run-in with another group of kobolds (Korgon used Roar! It's Super effective!), and an Orc battlemage (that's what DM called it, I dunno if that's an actual thing) who skedaddled as soon as we attacked, but we eventually came to a new hallway. Of *course* it's full of things that want to kill us. In this case, there was a troll. It wasn't afraid of us (read; Korgon didn't intimidate it), thanks to the magic of te Orc battlemage we'd run into earlier. We killed it by having Matteo and Joenan (my dad's Barbarian) hide in the holes in the wall on either side (picture a crucifix, but with the vertical line being five blocks long instead of four. The two sideblocks were where we put Matteo and Joenan, making it look like one long tunnel after they got their shields up), having Korgon goad it into charging, then Matteo and Joenan sneak-attack it from behind. They hamstrung it, and Korgon split its head clean in half.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED (and maybe concluded) IN PART 3!!!",

        "text": "This tale comes from the time my friends and I were all trying out 5e for the first time. Normally I DM for the entire group, but to give everyone a good feel for the system we each took turns DMing. I was saved for last as the grand finale to the test sessions. \n\nThe party was as follows: Taras Deathblade (My character): a human wizard raised by a legendary fighter adventurer. Out to prove to his father that you don't need muscles to change the world. Never backs away from a challenge, even if he has no chance of winning.\n\nNadashi: A nameless elf ranger who was the hero of a small village looking to help save others. Is actually the heir to the Elf kingdom and his half brother is constantly trying to get him killed.\n\nPerrin Underbrot: A halfling rouge that helped the party escape from a catacomb when they were captured by a slaver organization. Likes to sneak around for no reason.\n\nRhogar: A Dragonborn warrior looking to prove his honor to the god Bahamut. A general all-around nice guy.\n\nFor my session of the campaign the party had been trying to tie up the loose ends of the previous session by investigating the back alleys and scummier parts of town. They continue investigating until after sunset.\n\nSuddenly the party is set upon by a group of black cloaked elves. Aided by the element of surprise the elves throw golden amulets at the party and say a word of command. Unable to find good footing in the narrow alleyways each member of the party is hit by an amulet.\n\nThe amulets whisk the party in to a spherical room with nothing but a door and ancient engravings on the ceiling. The engraved language is too old and nobody in the party recognizes it. So like the adventurers they are they press further on into this strange place.\n\nAs they explore the dungeon they find that it is set up in a series of trials. One room had a long and narrow staircase where zombies poured endlessly from the top. After fighting a little while and finding it endless, the party had Taras dimension door to the top of the staircase where a large black pedestal was. It turned out to be a switch that ended the flood of zombies. \n\nOne room was large labyrinth filled with books, magical walls, invisible monsters and poisonous gas. Where the party had to solve a series of riddles to get to the exit of the labyrinth. To combat the invisible monsters, the party took advantage of the narrow hallways and had Rhogar wildly swing his sword in front of him at all times like a blind man. \n\nOne room was a torture chamber where the warden was a greater succubus. She was torturing some victims chained to the wall. The party got into a hostage situation where she threatened to kill an innocent if they don't throw down their weapons. But instead of diplomacy, Nadashi just shot an arrow at her revealing that all the innocents where actually succubi, and that shooting an arrow at the greater succubi broke her concentration. \n\nThere was a cubic room with spikes on parts of the walls, ceiling and floor where gravity would randomly shift every 30 seconds. Perrin used his dexterity to climb up a wall of spikes to access the black pedestal that deactivated the gravity. \n\nThere was an extended section of the dungeon filled with identical rooms and identical chests where the party had to place objects into the chests to find the exit. \n\nThe whole thing was topped off with a final confrontation with an Adult Red Dragon in a large arena with holes leading to a pit of lava. After a close battle Taras got the final hit on the Dragon with a cone of cold, turning it into a frozen dragon statue. After the party grabbed as much riches as they could carry in the dragon's hoard, they found a final room with an old man inside.\n\nRohgar: \"Who are you old man?\"\n\nOld Man: \"I am Ilos.\"\n\nPerrin: \"What is this place?\"\n\nIlos: \"This is a construct of mine where I test people to see if they are worthy of inheriting the mantle of Ilos.\"\n\nNadashi: \"Does that mean you'll give us this mantle now? Because we've cleared your trials.\"\n\nIlos:\"You can only qualify for the mantle if you clear the trials alone. In my millennia here none have yet suceeded. Your coming here is actually a great inconvenience and now I have to fix everything for the next person who wishes for my mantle.\"\n\nIlos:\"However you are the first group to survive so when you get back to the real world, can you make sure that they only send people who want my mantle in here? I'm tired of removing all the corpses and fixing my trials every time. In exchange, I'll let you keep that gold.\"\n\nIlos:\"Now begone.\"\n\nAfter some investigation the party found out a rumor that those magical amulets kill anyone nearby when the word of command is spoken, and that Nadashi's half brother had sent assassins armed with these pendants to deal with him.\n\n",

        "text": "My group managed to pull off a fairly decent plan. \nIt was a bit of a long - term plan. For those familiar with the adventure (spoilers incoming!), there is a bandit camp in the middle of the map that you run into during the earlier part of the book. We took that one out, took one of the guys prisoner and then my character (a lawful neutral cavalier who was leaning towards lawful evil a bit) proceeded to dismember all the bandits and nail their body parts to trees as a warning to any other potential bandits in the area. We also took their stuff, including some bottles of strong alcohol that were to go to the Stag Lord.\n\nAnyway, a few weeks later we find the Stag Lord's fort and already have a bit of information about it. Our elven mage (who has built himself some sort of hat of magical disguise and made me a amulet of charm, boosting my already considerable levels of bluff, sense motive and diplomacy) and myself disguised ourselves as bandits and walked into the fort. We spun a tale about being from the camp and being the only ones who escaped the slaughter by a terribly brutal group of mercanaries. We hid in the wilderness for a couple weeks (seeing the torn - apart bodies of Kressle and our other companions didnt fill us with a desire to cross paths with these mercaneries again) and then made our way carefully back to the fort.\n\nA couple of decent bluff rolls later we were in the fort. There we took two days to look around, managing to make a couple of plans. We found out that the Staglord is a drunk and his right hand man didnt seem too happy with the whole situation. We found out that said man (Akiros?) had a diary he was keeping, snuck into his rooms and stole it, read it and returned it without incident. Now we knew he had been a paladin some time ago, had killed a woman in a fit of rage and had to flee into the wilderness. We took a bit of a risk but decided to approach him, talking to him in his quarters. My cavalier revealed himself and offered him a high position in the Barony I had already started building, promising him a pardon for all former crimes. Akiros agreed after an interesting (and lengthy) discussion. We also told him about a plan we had already prepared beforehand:\n\nWe, in our bandit persona, knew about a small cache of stuff that had been hidden by Kressle. It was in an area frequently patrolled by the bloodthirsty mercenaries, but with a bigger group of bandits we were willing to try and get it. Such a success would also raise the bandits' low morale, seeing as how a lot of it was high-quality alcohol.\n\nWe went and got the cache with Akiros in the lead, bringing it back to the fort triumphantely. We had spent quite a bit of money to add some nice little drugs to the alcohol (designed to make everyone drinking it sleep a nice long sleep). We added a double - dose to the staglord's personal alcohol (that we took from Kressle), just to make sure. He was so happy to get his stuff that he didnt get suspicious at all.\n\nOf course the bandits started celebrating and the staglord, being a drunk and everything, retreated into his room and drank as much as he could too. After that it was easy to have our other guys in the party approach the fort in the cover of darkness with a dozen of our soldiers, open them the gates and slaughter the drunk/sleeping bandits. The staglord and some of his men were taken alive and later publicly executed by my character at Oleg's trading post.\n\nThe only thing that proved tricky is that one other of the Staglord's officers (a rouge guy who seemed more clever than the rest) escaped. He didnt drink but saw he had no chance to fight against us. We didnt even notice he was gone until a couple hours later. He might show up again to cause trouble, who knows?\n\nOther than that I was really happy with how well our plan worked",

        "text": "Well everyone seems to be enthralled with Omega and how he developed as a character I'll give you a rough idea of how it worked outside of the roleplay.\n\nAs a construct designed for combat he is pretty armoured. This meant he counted as having heavy armour with an undersuit of scalemail. Without the movement restrictions because he doesn't tire or have weight fatique.\n\nHe doesn't eat or sleep or need water and aside from buying new weapons has little interest in gold. He has a basic understanding of magic so long as he has seen the person casting it and has paid close attention. He is also very skilled with Swords and Daggers from his time as a training construct and also has basic buckler and shield training.\n\nHe can learn new techniques if he watched someone carefully as well as if he wants to be taught by someone by passing a few tests. He also has basic magic protection from his rune given to him by Grethor. This was mainly a counteract from the wizard player observing that Constructs are prone to magic failure and would probably save Omega from a hilarious accident once he learnt what magic was. All it does is give him a D6 extra points when it came to resisting or dispelling magic.... usually his own.\n\nHe also sinks in water and will listen to the party on all matters so has little of his own opinions on matters until someone explains it to him.\n\nBut back to the story, In this scenario we investigated a tomb that had the first relic we needed for the quest. We were joined by a new player who wanted to play really badly despite the campaign having a few sessions already. Our DM agreed though it became pretty clear that the guy only wanted to kill things and had no interest in the roleplay section of the game....\n\n---start of encounter---\nOmega had enjoyed meeting the new party member Draketis. A bronze dragonkin clad in shining armour with a fierce mace and shield between his claws in a vicelike grip. He stood at 7 feet, which for the giant Omega was a sight to see. He had always wondered if he would meet with someone taller than him, Krathul was just taller than him but he could change his size at will so Omega never really thought about him as someone taller than him.\n\nGrethor scratched his beard as he pondered a thought, \"Why would a dragonkin be so far from the jewel lands?\" he thought to himself as the lumbering giant walked on staring blankly ahead. His train of thought was broken when he realised Omega was starting to walk in the same long stride as Draketis and Omega had begun to open his arms out. He chuckled to himself and cleared his throat, \"Omega lad. Come here a second.\"\n\nOmega stopped and waited fro grethor to catch up with him. \"Grethor!\" he said excitedly, \"Have you seen how he walks?\" he chirped. \"Big steps! Omega never thought of big steps! Less steps!\"\nGrethor smiled, \"Good observation lad.\" he said happily. The innocence of the construct had been a useful quality. He would often notice small things before anyone knew they existed. \"You may be a learner drone lad.\" the wizard said carefully, \"but you sure know how to put 2 and 2 together!\" he chuckled.\n\nOmega stopped in his tracks, Grethor turned to the seemingly stunned construct.\n\"FOUR!\" Omega shouted, before walking again.\nThis sent the party into a fit of laughter. Grethor wiped a tear from his eye, \"Nothing gets past you lad! I meant you know how to weight up a situation well. Tell us what's going on and what is going to happen.\" he paused, \"Lad when I said weight up the situation it's a phrase of speech. Don't actually try to collect materials to weigh.\" he added quickly.\n\nOmega smiled and nodded, \"Omega made a joke. Omega knew what you meant.\" and with that let out a laugh of his own. Grethor smiled and gave the construct a pat on the shoulder.\n\"You're getting better at this human thing lad.\" he said with a smile.\n\nA clash of steel as loud as a drum followed by a roar sounded from ahead of the party. Jumping them out of their happy thought stream. \"ENOUGH!\" the Dragonkin barked with a forked tongue. \"THERE ARE BANDITS TO BE KILLED AND TREASURE TO BE GAINED. WHY MUST YOU ALL BE SO PLEASED WITH YOURSELVES.\" he roared angrily.\n\nGrethor met the gaze of their new ally. \"Lad we do things at our own pace.\" he spoke in a stern but friendly voice. \"We will get there, the treasure won't go anywhere and neither will the reward.\"\nThe Dragonkin lumbered forward towards the old man. Grethor didn't move an inch and kept his eye contact. The Dragonkin sniffed and licked his lips with the forked tongue, fire danced in his throat and his eyes narrowed. \"Who gives you the right to say where we go?\" He spoke in a deep rumbling tone. \"One squeeze of my claws and you would be as useful as that book the demon child is carrying around.\"\n\nPreeta shuffled from one foot to the other, Krathul rumbled within her head to be let out so he could show the dragon who the real demon was. She clenched it tighter. She knew dragonkin hated magic users with a passion and Krathul was indifferent to any race bar himself. \"Not now.\" she whispered into the tome. Omega twitched his head, unsure of what was going on with his new friends.\n\nGrethor smiled, \"Lad i've seen bandits, bruisers and kings threaten me with every weapon under the sun. I've seen whores plunge knives into the necks of men and women alike and yet here I stand.\" he said scratching his beard. \"A dragonkin is only as strong as hid brood. When you travel alone you risk everything.\" he smiled, \"You can go if you want. But don't expect to last long on these roads alone.\"\n\nOmega walked forwards and joined the wizard. The Dragonkin readied his shield. The wizard still did not move. Omega looked at the giant creature. \"Omega says not now.\" Grethor smiled and nodded at Omega who was now staring at the wizard as if waiting for approval. \"Omega says we need to keep going. This will not solve anything and you are not being a friend of Grethor by shouting.\" he continued.\n\nThe Dragonkin looked at the construct. \"So be it object.\" he grunted, \"Let us walk.\"\nGrethor waited until the lumbering Dragonkin had turned and begun walking before he spoke to Omega. \"Lad you remember what I told you about bad guys?\" he said to the construct.\nOmega nodded, \"Some people are bad. Not born that way usually out of hunger. They just want to live and will sacrifice being human to live.\" he said in a informative tone.\nThe wizard looked shocked, \"Lad I was just going to say a bad guy is someone who does something bad. Where did you learn that?\"\nOmega pointed behind him, \"Omega and Krathul talk sometimes.\" he spoke casually, Preeta looked down at her feet scared she had done something wrong. \"He is calmer at night when humans are asleep and Preeta is reading the book.\" Omega added nervously, he could tell Preeta was scared now. \"He speaks alot about killing everyone and joining his kind. I think he's scared of losing preeta though.\" Omega said, he heard Preeta whisper into the tome to keep him quiet.\n\nGrethor smiled, \"You really just like making friends don't ya lad.\" he commented. \"No matter what they did in the past or present you're prepared to let it slide and just learn about them.\" he finished with a smile.\nOmega looked at the wizard, \"Omega was made to learn about fighting and teach others how to fight.\" Omega looked ahead inquisitively. \"Maybe Omega can learn about others and teach people that what goes on in head isn't what makes someone good or bad.\" He turned back to grethor, \"Krathul was in that cave alone for so long. Omega was alone for short time before finding friends. Omega didn't understand what alone was until Omega realised that he didn't have anyone.\" Omega wiped his eye area. Grethor knew he had picked up on what it was to be sad. \"When Omega was walking, he saw a hair person with a smaller hair person.\"\nGrethor chuckled, \"They're wolves lads. They're not human they're animals.\"\nOmega nodded silently, \"The wolf had a smaller wolf. When Omega walked towards them to be friends the big wolf moved in front of the smaller one. As I got closer it shouted and shouted louder.\" He paused, \"Omega got scared and walked away.\" He finished.\nGrethor patted the construct again. \"Lad. Wolves don't make friends with anyone. She thought you were trying to hurt her baby and wanted to protect it.\" the wizard explained carefully. \"Like you did with me just now.\" he added.\n\nOmega nodded, \"That's when Omega realised he was alone. Omega didn't have another Omega it was just Omega.\" the construct replied with sadness.\nGrethor coughed, \"Lad look around you. There is only one of each of us. We don't need another Omega because you're the best Omega there is!\" he chuckled.\n\nThe construct looked at the party then back to Grethor, \"Omega is thankful that maybe we don't have another Krathul.\" he said slowly, \"Omega would get bored of carrying that tome around.\" he added before breaking into laughter.\n\nGrethor laughed, \"You got that right lad!\" he replied in awe at the constructs developing sense of humor.\n\nThe party finished the road and came across the temple.\n\n--- end of part 4 ---\n\nGlad everyone is enjoying this!\n\nI'm also accepting friend requests (i think) now on reddit! :)",

        "text": "As you approach the building you are stunned by the lack of habitation in the area. The building seems to stand alone in the wilderness, there are no lights except that of your own ever-burning torch. You are struck by the sudden silence. You haven’t heard anything so devoid of life since you were in the countryside. Even then there was the sound of bugs, the wind, but here there is nothing. It is like standing in a vacuum of sound. You aren't far from the river and the smell of the built up detritus that has just been thrown there and has just been left to clog up the area has reached your nose. There may not be the smell of life here but there is certainly the smell of rancidity, the smell of death. You and your fellow adventurers look at each other, it is enough to contribute to your nervous sensibility given to what you know the danger of what you are perusing. The first thing you approach is the windows. You can’t reach them without climbing so one of your companions boosts you up to take a look. As you try to claw your way up to the sill you get the awful feeling in your fingernails of resistance when you scratch a chalkboard or a piece of iron. It makes you want to leap back and leave, this place is old, it feels dirty, it get under your nails and under your skin but you take a grip. You look in through the darkened windows and despite the great sacrifice you made to your nails you can’t see much. Shadows move. There is a dim light in there. It’s almost as if there are people in there moving around. But they don’t look like people. There are no arms or legs, they seem like bodies moving, like shapes moving backward and forth. It takes a little while before you become aware of the fact the shapes are moving in a continuous rhythm. Swaying… just swaying. You put your hands over your eyes trying to block out what little light there is behind you, trying to get a better glimpse of what is inside and as you do so a face comes up to the window! You can’t help but shriek out this face so… ugly… so hideous…so warped. Not even the person you were looking for as far as you were aware but makes you jump, makes you fall backwards off the companion that was boosting you up. You fall backwards onto the dirt. You hit your head. Your companions ask you what happened. You say there is someone in there, someone at the window. Your cover is blown, you’re going straight in, you go for the doors and as you pry them open there is a creaking grate, a scrape of metal. Like this place hasn’t been opened up for a long time or wasn’t supposed to be opened up at all. As soon as the door opens the odour hits you. There is no slow wave of heat, no gradual dispersal of smells. It is like a wall comes out of the doorway and smacks you all in the face. It is kind of odour that makes your eyes water and you want to not breathe through your nose or your mouth because it smells and tastes so pungent and rancid. It smells and tastes of meat, off meat. The way that meat gets when you leave it in the fridge too long and it becomes wet and slimy, the way it congeals and becomes just off. You can’t get rid of the pungency of this odour. Something in here has died, maybe not that long ago. You and your companions usher in. You have your weapons to hand. This is no place you have ever seen. Like no dungeon or stone keep. This is one huge, long, chilled building. Maybe one of the reasons you couldn’t see in was the coolness in certain areas below the windows where some magical source is cooling them. There is obviously some condensation making seeing through the windows even harder than usual. And yet it doesn’t override the heat in this place. This amount of strange mechanical machinery. While the areas immediately around the windows may be magically cool the rest of this place from all the machinery is warm. The tables that are laid out increasingly as you get towards the back of this building are laid out with what can only be described as sacrifices. The things moving on chains, clinking and clanking as they are moving through this great long building have stumps of bodies legless, armless just hanging on them. As if they are on a sushi carousel. Occasionally being pried off by the figures at ground level by the figures at ground level who are hacking them up. The gantry just above the lip of the chilled areas contains a number of unhuman looking men. One of which is pointing at the door, at you in fact, he is the one you saw at the window. You take a step, you feel something wet. You can’t help but look down. As you lift your foot there is actual resistance as whatever you have stepped in is so congealed, so coagulated that it is actually pulling like bubble-gum except it is brown, dark and red. It is something you don’t even want to know what part of a human this is from, what body fluid it is. As you part the seal with your foot from the seal as if you couldn’t imagine the smell being any worse it hits you in the back of your nose. That smell of feculence, of gore. All of the workers put down their blades. Perhaps that is a mercy because they don’t want to hack you up. Instead they just start to walk towards you. One of the men on the gantry is stood next to something you hadn't noticed before, quite out of place in this huge abattoir. A small music box, clearly used occasionally to instill a bit of calm and music in the workers. He takes the crank, turns it softly with his hand and starts the music playing. A classical piece. It is soft, melodic, soothing and tinkling. It creates a harsh mix with the pulling and grunting and thrusting of these men and women and unidentifiable things. Dragging you further into the room. Those you shoot with your best magical arrows or cut down with your enchanted blade are replaced by two others. These blank faced, blank minded automatons pull you towards the tables. They like prey that moves, that wriggles. They need fresh meat. As you are slammed down on the wood you feel the sharp pain as the open wound on the back of your head hits the wooden table. You see stars. You look up. The one who is looking over you has picked up her blade again and she looks sad. A tear drops from her encrusted bloodshot eye and falls down from her cheek and falls onto your lip.You don't want to taste it but you can't help it. So salty. You are restrained. This thing is crying for you as it raises its blade above its head. You don’t feel the pain as the blade comes down, not immediately. You hear the sound of it. You hear the sound of the hacking of the meat, you hear the sound of your screaming companions. You see the blade going up again…so dark in here. How can they tell what they are doing? There is no light in here beyond a few simple boxed torches laid around the corners of the room you can just see out of the corner of your eye creating flickering shadows. The smell is mostly gone now. It’s just the sound. The sound of cutting through resisting meat and bone, the sound of screaming and crying and begging. The sound of the music in the background. You try to penetrate the gloom and see the ceiling. How high up does it go? You try to see the windows, is there anybody out there? Greeted only by darkness.",
