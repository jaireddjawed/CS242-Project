        "text": "Luckily for us Epicurus himself has left us a brilliant, and brilliantly short, introduction to his philosophy. [His Letter to Meneoceus] (http://www.epicurus.info/etexts/Lives.html#I40) contains the basics of his thought and should be a starting point for all who wish to follow him. But here I will take us through the four-fold cure (Tetrapharmakos) designed to guide us through life.\n\n**Tetrapharmakos** \n\n* Don't fear god,\n* Don't worry about death;\n* What is good is easy to get, and\n* What is terrible is easy to endure\n\n\n**“Don’t fear God.”** \n\nFrom the surviving works of Epicurus it is clear that he did believe, or at least professed to believe, [in gods.](http://www.iep.utm.edu/epicur/#SH3e) But we must be clear that his conception of the gods was very different from those of gods who interacted with humanity directly and certainly different to modern monotheistic ideas of god. The Epicurean gods were beings of contentment, utterly free from desire and pain. How could such beings threaten us? Principal Doctrine 1 sums it up “A blessed and imperishable being neither has trouble itself nor does it cause trouble for anyone else; therefore, it does not experience feelings of anger or indebtedness, for such feelings signify weakness.”\n\nFor modern readers the solution is far simpler. In the complete absence of evidence for a deity/deities it is logical to act as if they do not exist. The non-existent and the absent are similarly unable to harm us.\n\n**“Don’t worry about death,”** says the tetrapharmakos. How can we not worry about death? The end of life is a fear common to all people. As with all things we must approach it with reason. Epicurus wrote to our fears in his Letter to Menoeceus “Death, therefore, the most awful of evils, is nothing to us, seeing that, when we are, death is not come, and, when death is come, we are not.” He explained further in Principal Doctrine 2: Death is nothing to us, because a body that has been dispersed into elements experiences no sensations, and the absence of sensation is nothing to us.\n\nRoman Epicureans had carved on their tombs *‘Non fui, fui, non sum, non curo’* (\"I was not; I was; I am not; I do not care\"). That is exactly the way to think of death and so banish its terror. Before your birth you were untroubled, after death you will be in the same state and so equally untroubled.\n\n**“What is good is easy to get.”** Epicureanism is a hedonistic philosophy, but not one of unenlightened consumption. Pleasure is the highest good, Epicurus thought, but the highest pleasure was absence of pain and desire. Vatican Saying 33 tells us “The cry of the flesh bids us escape from hunger, thirst, and cold; for he who is free of these and expects to remain so might vie in happiness even with Zeus.” Food, water, warmth, all basic things and all simple ways to satisfy the basic needs of our flesh. Principal Doctrine 3 explains that “Pleasure reaches its maximum limit at the removal of all sources of pain. When such pleasure is present, for as long as it lasts, there is no cause of physical nor mental pain present – nor of both together.”\n\nFor Epicurus pleasures came in two main forms static (katastematic) pleasures and active (kinetic) pleasures. Static pleasures are the ones which come from a state of being. Ataraxia is the state of being free from distress and anxiety. Aponia is the state of being free from pain. \n\nThe Epicurean view on pleasures can be seen in a triplet from his Principal Doctrines.\n* Principal Doctrine 8: No pleasure is a bad thing in itself, but some pleasures are only obtainable at the cost of excessive troubles.\n* Principal Doctrine 26  All desires which create no pain when unfulfilled are not necessary; such desires may easily be dispelled when they are seen as difficult to fulfil or likely to produce harm.\n* Principal Doctrine 29 Among desires some are natural and necessary, some natural but not necessary, and others neither natural nor necessary, but due to baseless opinion.\n\n\n**“What is terrible is easy to endure.”** While one of the aims of Epicureanism is the removal of pain no human life has ever existed entirely free of pain. Some pains are truly terrible, but can it be true that they are easy to endure? \n\tIn his letter to Ideomeneus, written as he lay dying, Epicurus wrote “On this blissful day, which is also the last of my life, I write this to you.  My continual sufferings from strangury and dysentery are so great that nothing could augment them.  But the cheerfulness of my mind, which arises from the remembrance of our past conversations, counterbalances all these afflictions.” For the prepared mind the memory of pleasures can be used to offset current pain. \n\nThis portion of the tetrapharmakos is perhaps the most difficult to agree with. Anyone who has ever suffered a toothache might be tempted to reject it. Shakespeare disagreed with it in Richard II-\n&gt; O, who can hold a fire in his hand\n\n&gt; By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?\n\n&gt; Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite\n\n&gt; By bare imagination of a feast?\n\n&gt; Or wallow naked in December snow\n\n&gt; By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?\n\n&gt; O, no! the apprehension of the good\n\n&gt; Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:\n\n&gt; Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more\n\n&gt; Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.\n\nIt may be that the doctrine of ‘What is terrible is easy to endure’ is not a truth, as the others seem to be, but an injuction. Perhaps we need to add to the front of the saying “To the properly prepared mind…”\n\nIt may also have been more obviously true in the context of ancient medicine. Pain can be slight or great, and transient or persisting. If slight then it is easy to put aside. If it is great then it is unlikely to persist for long, if only because death is likely to result in the end and free us from pain. Now with increasing possibilities to remain alive for longer a terrible pain could end up being extended far beyond nature’s usual duration.\n\nOn that cheerful note I wish you all a happy Christmas or other culturally appropriate holiday.",

        "text": "Two particularly interesting sections from Nietzsche's *Beyond Good and Evil*. The first is on Epicurus' attitudes, the other on the fatal flaw of Stoicism:\n\n&gt;How malicious philosophers can be! I know of nothing more venomous than the joke Epicurus permitted himself against Plato and the Platonists; he called them *Dionysiokolakes*. That means literally—and this is the foreground meaning—\"flatterers of Dionysius,\" in other words, tyrant's baggage and lickspittles; but in addition to this he also wants to say, \"they are all *actors*, there is nothing genuine about them\" (for *Dionysokolax* was a popular name for an actor).^1 And the latter is really the malice that Epicurus aimed at Plato: he was peeved by the grandiose manner, the *mis en scène*^2 at which Plato and his disciples were so expert—at which Epicurus was not an expert—he, that old schoolmaster from Samos, who sat, hidden away, in his little garden at Athens and wrote three hundred books—who knows? perhaps from rage and ambition against Plato?\n\n&gt;It took a hundred years until Greece found out who this garden god, Epicurus, had been.—Did they found out?— (Nietzsche, *On the Prejudices of Philosophers*, 7)\n\n1. The reference is to Epicurus' fragment 238, the ambiguity is due to the fact that Dionysius was the name of the Sicilian tyrant whom Plato had tried for several years to convert to his own philosophy.\n\n2. Staging.\n\nFor reference, fragment 238 is: \n\n&gt;**Diogenes Laertius, *Lives of Philosophers*, X.8**: Plato’s school he called the “flatterers of Dionysius.”  Plato himself he called “golden.” ... Heraclitus a “muddler,” Democritus he called “Lerocritus” {the gossip-monger}, Antidorus “Sannidorus” {a fawning gift-bearer}, the Cynics “enemies of Greece,” the Dialecticians “despoilers,” and he called Pyrrho “ignorant” and a “bore.”\n\n---\n\n&gt;\"According to nature\" you want to *live*? O you noble Stoics, what deceptive words these are! Imagine a being like nature, wasteful beyond measure, indifferent beyond measure, without purposes and consideration, without mercy and justice, fertile and desolate and uncertain at the same time; imagine indifference itself as a power—how *could* you live according to this indifference? Living—is that not precisely wanting to be other than this nature? Is not living—estimating, preferring, being unjust, being limited, wanting to be different? And supposing your imperative “live according to nature” meant at bottom as much as “live according to life”—how could you *not* do that? Why make a principle of what you yourselves are and must be?\n\n&gt;In truth, the matter is altogether different: while you pretend rapturously to read the canon of your law in nature, you want something opposite, you strange actors and self-deceivers! Your pride wants to impose your morality, your ideal, on nature—even on nature—and incorporate them in her; you demand that she should be nature “according to the Stoa,” and you would like all existence to exist only after your own image—as an immense eternal glorification and generalization of Stoicism. For all your love of truth, you have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, so rigidly-hypnotically to see nature the wrong way, namely Stoically, that you are no longer able to see her differently. And some abysmal arrogance finally still inspires you with the same insane hope that *because* you know how to tyrannize yourselves—Stoicism is self-tyranny—nature, too, lets herself be tyrannized: is not the Stoic—a *piece* of nature?\n\n&gt;But this is an ancient, eternal story: what formerly happened with the Stoics still happens today, too, as soon as any philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always creates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise. Philosophy is this tyrannical drive itself, the most spiritual will to power, to the “creation of the world,” to the *causa prima*.^1 (Nietzsche, *On the Prejudices of Philosophers*, 9)\n\n1. First cause.\n\n---\n\n\nNietzsche, Friedrich. “Beyond Good and Evil.” *Basic Writings of Nietzsche*. Trans. and Ed. Walter Kaufmann. New York: The Modern Library, 2000. 179-435. Print.\n",

        "text": "Hello. Hope all is well. This month for the 20th we are going in a slightly different direction. I'm looking for all the sources which you think are invaluable to learning about Epicureanism. It's probably time we had an introduction to Epicureanism somewhere on the subreddit and it would be good to know what you think should be included.\n\nAs a start I've gathered up the original writings that survive from **Epicurus**-\n\n[Principal Doctrines](http://www.epicurus.net/en/principal.html)\n\n[Vatican Sayings](http://www.epicurus.info/etexts/VS.html)\n\n[The Life of Epicurus by Diogenes Laertius](http://www.epicurus.info/etexts/Lives.html) (Obviously not by Epicurus but contains the three extant letters of Epicurus which are great texts for gaining the basics of his philosophy. It also contains his will.)\n\nThere are also the fragments of his works which survived as quotes in the works of others. [Here is one version with sources of the fragments.](http://www.epicurus.info/etexts/fragments.html) [This version has the fragments in their original Greek as well as translated.](http://www.monadnock.net/epicurus/fragments.html)\n\n**Lucretius** is obviously the best surviving text for giving us a complete look at Epicureanism. [Here](http://classics.mit.edu/Carus/nature_things.html) is a copy of De Rerum Natura which can be read for free online. There are better translations than this one though and cheap paperbacks can be picked up easily which often come with very good introductions to help understand the text.\n\n[The life of Atticus](http://www.epicurus.net/en/atticus.html) by **Cornelius Nepos** is a great look at how Epicureans lived in the Ancient world. Atticus was a friend of Cicero and many other important men of the late Republic yet was never drawn into the brutal politics of the age.\n\nWhat other texts do you think would be vital for an introduction? Letters 20 and 21 of Seneca give some good information from a not totally friendly point of view. It is from Seneca that we know the motto carved over the entrance of the Garden - \"Stranger, here you will do well to tarry; here our highest good is pleasure.\"\n\nOf particular interest would be some of the works of Philodemus. The academic books published on his works are all uniformly expensive so if anyone has a source on a cheap copy let me know.\n\n-As ever I'd like to point to the [reading list](http://www.reddit.com/r/Epicureanism/comments/2akelw/my_recommendations_for_epicurean_reading/) gathered by /u/jumpstartation as it has some great suggestions!  -",
