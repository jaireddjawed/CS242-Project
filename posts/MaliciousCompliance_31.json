        "text": "TLDR at the end. I hope i made the malicious compliance clear in it! I made a new account just for this posts since i have coworkers on my main account!\n\nSo this story is still on going but I’m pretty sure I know where it’s going to end!\nI work for a new up and coming shoe company in the Pacific Northwest, family owned and ran (my first mistake). Last weekend we had to shut the orders down and do a warehouse wide inventory count, basically everyone has to come in on one of their days off and count three separate aisles. Sure not a single problem. I came in on my day off begrudgingly, finished my aisles and left. Now our inventories last from Friday-Monday morning, so whatever the day shift guys don’t finish on Saturday we’ve got to cover for them too. We come in on Sunday and found out not a single person counted on Saturday. Great. We get their aisles done and call it a day. Now flash forward to Tuesday, I got told by my boss that one of the aisles I counted on Sunday was done too fast and needed to be redone since there was a mistake found. I thought to myself well this isn’t right i took 3 hours and really took my time on that aisle. So I started again, after making it through half of the aisle again I realized not a single thing was off. About the time I realized that, one of the three owners of the company comes out to watch me count and to put in his two cents. I’ll call him the goblin from now on\n\nThe goblin “When I went through these aisles today it was all a mess. You better really take you time and count it all”\nMyself “Okay! I haven’t noticed a problem so far but I’ll make sure I do that!”\n\nThat’s when I got to the part of the aisle when it was really just a mess of different sizes and sku numbers. To make sure I got every single item I did the most reasonable thing to me, I took out every single item in those locations and manually entered them in one by one to make sure it was 100% correct instead of going off of what the RF gun said. Sure enough I found countless mistakes that were surprisingly added today! I’ve always known the goblin has had it out for me since I started. Long story short I had a death in the family the first week I started and he wanted me gone after the first called out day. For the rest of the day I kept this up for every aisle I counted. Took them all out of the location and added it in so that the numbers were absolutely perfect. \n\nFlash forward to today, I go to clock in and the warehouse boss, WB for short, comes up and asks me how i did it. Explained to him what i did the previous day and he agreed with me. He said himself that was a perfect way to make sure it was perfect. The Goblin had then talked to WB and told him that I had taken too long counting the aisles last night and that the inventory numbers were all off. They checked the locations and sure enough things were off. But the kicker is that they were added in today, but they were off anyways. I was told to go home early today since the counts were off again for the 2nd day in a row. \nNow I’m home writing this post about how the owner added inventory with the goal of getting me fired. Oh well I went above and beyond to make sure it was right, but it still wasn’t done in a timely manner. \n\nTLDR; Boss asked me to recount after doing inventory, took too long but did it perfectly. Added inventory today with the sole purpose of getting me fired. ",

        "text": "I recently submitted an MC that happened a long time ago. This one is a bit more current.\n\nI currently live in a 3 story apartment building with my wife (pregnant with our 2nd child) and my almost-2 year old daughter.\n\nOur downstairs neighbor is an old woman who lives alone (with a small yippy dog) and shall be henceforth abbreviated as OH for old hag.\n\nBackstory is that on multiple occasions the old hag will knock on her ceiling (my floor) when she thinks we're stomping too much. In the middle of the day. (Btw she often lets her yippy dog outside who bark incessantly past 11pm)\n\nThe apartment definitely has thin floors because we hear our upstairs neighbors throughout the day and late into the night. But they're another story altogether.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife's parents were visiting us, and while standing outside on the balcony with my MiL and daughter, OH walks outside her terrace with the yippy dog. Conversation went something like this:\n\n\nOH: oh, hi. Are you my upstairs neighbor?\n\n\nMe: yep! We live here, just me, my wife and our daughter. (I said as I motioned to my daughter for her to see the cutie)\n\n\nOH: oh... I thought it was an African American man who lived there. \n\n\nMe (I'm very white): umm.. no ma'am, not to my knowledge. We've been here for a little over a year now.\n\n\nOH: I see.. \n\n\nMe: well it was nice meeting you... Gotta go help inside (and took the opportunity to leave)\n\n\nShe speaks to my MiL for another minute as I go back inside to help my wife with some lunch preparations.\n\nNot 2 minutes later my phone rings. It's the apt complex's front office management saying our downstairs neighbor is reporting a noise complaint and we're too loud. (In my mind: \"Excuse me?? The fucking bitch said what?!) She could have said it to my face and asked like a decent person, but that was just *low*.\n\nMy wife and I are pissed, so we go to the front office to let them know that its absurd of her to complain at 2 in the afternoon about *footsteps*. We werent playing music or anything. Just hanging out around the house with the in-laws and kiddo.\n\nProperty mgmt confirms that she is in the wrong and county regulations state that normal noise times are from 10am - 11pm, and as long as we're not being excessively loud (like throwing a party) she can't complain.\n\nFast forward to yesterday:\n\nI get home late, around 9pm with my daughter, wife doesnt get home til 9:30 (we both often work late shifts at our jobs, my mom watches my daughter during the day) so I keep her awake to see mommy for a bit before bed.\n\nWife gets home and we hang out in the living room for a bit, and my daughter wants me to chase her, so I do. She loves playing \"gonna getchu!\" It's about 9:40pm and \"quiet\" hours only start after 11.\n\nWithin a minute there is a pounding knock on our floor, for a FULL MINUTE WITHOUT STOPPING. \n\nThis absolutely terrified my daughter (who isn't quite 2 yet, but is very verbose) since she didn't understand what was happening. She starts crying and wailing saying \"All done! Knocking! All done! Knocking!\" Crying and repeating this mantra even through bedtime songs. It took her almost an hour to calm down from this and finally fall asleep, with the last thing she mutters being \"All done knocking\" one last time as she falls asleep.\n\nThis old Bitch is traumatizing my kid who's learning to walk/run and I'm not having it.\n\nWe go to bed and I go to the property mgmt office first thing this morning. Let them know what she did to my child the night before, and showed them a recording of her reaction to it, saying \"All done knocking\" as I was trying to sing her to sleep and another video of her wailing her eyes out, clearly terrified, as my wife held her before going to bed.\n\nManagement agreed that Old Hag is wrong here and is going to kindly let her know that she is not allowed to knock on my floor during non-quiet hours. If she does, I have the right to call the police on her for harrassment. (Im even considering filing a restraining order if she does it again)\n\nWell, the MC is now about to start:\n\nFrom 10am to 11pm, whenever my wife and I are home we are no longer going to watch our step as we have been in the past. We know how awful it is since we constantly hear our upstairs neighbors stomp around, so we *tried* to be extra careful up until now.\n\nNot anymore. She made my daughter cry and in turn really stressed out my pregnant wife goving her anxiety. She is gonna pay for it. From 10am to 11pm the elephant parade is officially in town. After that, quiet time it is!\n\n--------\n\nEDIT: No knocks from her yet, which I'm fine with.\n\nWe still try to be good neighbors despite our outrage so we keep the day stomping a little subtle. (Not doing anything like the guys in the 'neighbor noise as an art form video, as amazing as that is) Just an 'accidental' big stomp or dropping something heavy randomly here and there throughout the day.\n\nI feel this maximizes the effect as it's a very loud THUD that should disrupt her otherwise quiet time more-so than a contonuous noise -- ensuring she doesnt 'get used' to any amount of noise.\n\nWe used to also stop my daughter if she started bunny-hoping or running around too much - but not anymore. We're within our allowed noise time, so she has full freedom to run and jump as much as she wants. I especially encourage her to run laps through our open kitchen floor which is tile for extra noise while we were home during the day this weekend.\n\nThat's it for now though. \n\nWill update again if anything else happens.\n\nThank you for all the support and wonderrful ideas to maliciously comply with our 'noise-allowed' hours. I'm still keeping these recommendations in mind should the Old Hag decide to start shit again.\n\n",

        "text": "Forgive any typos as I'm posting from my phone.\n\nThis MC happened during my first year of college sometime in 2009, maybe early 2010.\n\nBackstory: My then girlfriend (now ex, ofc) and I had been together for a little over a year but were getting to a phase where we were arguing a lot and disagreeing on too many things.\n\nOne of her main complaints at the time is that whenever she was around my family, she demanded that they all speak English so she could understand. My family is predominantly from Brazil. Some of them, when they came to visit us, like my grandmother did not speak english very well but can understand some of it.\n\nMy ex *demanded* that everyone needs to speak english because she felt left out not understanding, despite all my efforts to translate for her and try to keep her included. It wasnt good enough. She also spoke spanish, so with a bit of effort she could definitely understand the gist of what was being said.\n\nWe had this argument on and off for *weeks* with me trying to explain to her that this was a tough thing to request from my family, seeing as some of them simply *DID NOT* speak english.\n\nHere's where the MC happened: One day when leaving the college campus, she brought up the argument again. I was tired of hearing it so I let her rant on, kinda half listening as I already knew her points, and my replies and logic were pretty much falling on deaf ears.\n\nAt one point she used a non-word, something along the lines of \"irregardlessly\" (I can't remember if it was that exactly, but something similar that sounds like a word but is actually ungrammatical and redundant of itself).\n\nI made the mistake of correcting her grammar mid-argument... \"Uh, GF, don't you mean \"Regardless\"? *Irregardless* isn't a real word. \n\nOh boy did that piss her off. She basically shouted \"WHAT?! STOP THE CAR. I'M GETTING OUT\".\n\nSo I complied. Stopped the car and she got out....So I drove away and left her there in the campus parking garage to find another way home. \n\nShe blew up my phone over the next couple hours but I ignored it. I was mentally ready to move on and couldn't really stand her attitude anymore. When I got home from my after-class job a few hours later I checked my phone and had nearly 100 missed calls and about 30 voicemails from her trying to say sorry and begging me to take her back, but I didn't want to hear it. I called her back to let her officially know it was over at that point.\n\nAnd that, folks, is how my first breakup ever went down. Hope this counts.",

I could have sworn we had a few copies in, do you want me to check?\"\n\n\"Ok.\" or \"Yes, we do.\" \\*awkward stares\\*\n\n\"There are a number of 2k games.

I hear they really made some great updates compared to last year's game!\" I then continue to describe how great the game is, something about the new rosters, etc, while building his excitement and feigning mine. I grabbed the game case.\n\n  \nI'll never forget the look on his face when I excitedly handed him a copy of the newest MLB 2k\\[year\\].\n\nHe realized his mistake, became instantly apologetic, and we got him squared away with the NBA game he wanted.",

        "text": "I work as an aircraft mechanic for an airline, this story is about my last week at my previous airline.\n\nWhen fixing aircraft you are required to have technical data on everything you do. On commercial aircraft its normally pretty easy since 95% of what we do has detailed manuals giving step by step instructions and references to other manual sections for stuff like ops checks.  As certified mechanics we are required to have our manuals readily accessible as we do our work, generally it's considered acceptable to have our manuals up on our computer where we were working (had mobile workstations in the hangar and laptops for at the gate)\n\nManagement at our base didnt think this was going to be ok with the FAA (it depends on the local FAA inspectors) and started demanding we print out our manuals.  A few months of this and they started getting in us harder that we weren't printing out ALL of our manuals. (We aren't printing out 8 pages of manual to service engine oil or checking tire pressures, we would literally spend more time printing it out than on the job.)\n\nWell here comes the MC. I was moving across the country and getting a job with a different airline. Knowing I was in my last week my leads and supervisors came to me with a glorious proposal.  Management wanted ALL the manuals printed out? Well they wanted me to do a routine inspection and print out ALL the manuals and follow them to the letter.\n\nNormally this inspection can be done by 1 experienced mechanic in 2 hours. Not tonight!  We pulled the plane in and I hit the computer...\n\nPrinted the inspection card..\n\nPrinted the manual for the checking lights...\n\nWhich needed manual for making aircraft safe for maintenance....\n\nWhich needed the manual for parking the aircraft...\n\nAnd the manual for electrically grounding the aircraft...\n\nAnd the manual for installing all the probe covers, wheel covers, engine plugs, etc...\n\nAnd this goes in for 250+ pages.... just to make the aircraft safe for maintenance.  I spend 5 hours printing all the manuals just for that, finding and installing the covers... and the best part of all of this. One of the wheel covers was missing! Technically I can no longer make the aircraft safe for maintenance because the manual never said this step was optional, so I wrote up in the logbook \"Unable to perform mx due to failure to make safe for maintenance due to missing wheel cover\"\n\nThis grounds the airplane.\n\nNow an emergency AOG (Aircraft On Ground) order for a wheel cover is created by my laughing supervisors. This is an expensive, emergency, faster than next day FedEx, order to find or purchase the closest wheel cover and get a courier to special deliver it if it couldn't get flown in by one of our planes.\n\nOh, and the way I wrote it up, no one could lay a finger on the plane until that cover arrived.  Grounded for a full day, no passengers were delayed, we had a spare plane, but still very expensive for the airline.\n\nManagement blew a gasket at first, then realized they could not legally punish anyone for following the rules exactly (rules which are federal law).  The next week they saw how unrealistic that 100% compliance truly was and let all my now former coworkers work as the certified professionals they are.",

There was a country buffet there and on the weekends my parents sometimes took me and my older brother, who had the same name as the restaurant.\n\nNow, if you've never been to a country style buffet, there are stations of food seperated. Like you have the ham and turkey carving section, then you have the vegetable section, than you have the dessert selection, etc. \n\nWell being the young child that I was at the time (8) I went to the buffet and avoided all vegetables. I went straight for the rice and gravy, being a personal favorite of mine, and chicken. After about 3 of those plates, my mother was getting frustrated about the lack of greenery on my plates. Me is Me. Mom is mom. Dad is Dad. DB is Brother. \n\nMom: SleeperNick, You better go get some greens on your plate right now.\n\nMe: Mom, I've gotten healthy stuff. I don't like the vegetables.\n\nDad: You better go up there and get something green right now and listen to your mother or you're grounded!\n\nDB: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO(DB stands for Douchebag Brother)\n\nAt this point, I have to go get something green. So I walk to the buffet and instead of walking to the vegetable station, I walk to the dessert section and load my plate down with green jello. Like a monstrous portion of green jello. I'm giggling just walking back to the table. I sit down, and Dad is laughing incredibly hard. Mom is furious. \n\nMom: I told you to go get something healthy!\n\nDad: You told him to go get something green! He's just doing what you said! \n\nMe: (Sitting there stuffing my face with green jello) Thanks mom!\n\nDB was mad. Oh well. He had to go get vegetables. Ha. Sad part of the story, 20 years later and I love vegetables. Boy how times change. ",

        "text": "Co-worker of mine gets this credit.\n\nWay back when a certain Law Enforcement agency I worked for started using GPS on all of their patrol cars an order was given for all dispatchers to use a command to identify the closest units to a call and send them. They said it didn't matter if it was their district, or their patrol zone or what, just send those units.\n\nNow, while there were some dispatchers not using the command at all since it was a new feature, my co-worker actually used it, but applied common sense to the GPS rule. He wouldn't dispatch out of District, (which was a huge no-no generally) and he would send 1 zone car and 1 \"closer\" unit to the high priority calls so that the proper units would be available to take the report if needed. Well, a big deal kind of call came in, he did his normal thing and in the aftermath he was scolded for not applying the \"always closest units!!\" command, even though his method worked (and became the new standing order shortly after) and was told point blank, \"Don't use common sense, just dispatch per GPS. Every time. Every unit, every call.\"\n\nAfter being chewed out about his dispatching technique, he goes back to his radio and waits for a high priority call for service. An armed suicidal subject in a domestic is called in and he sets out to comply with his directive. Closest units? The shift commander and the Desk Deputy (who doesn't have a car) \"Lima-1 and D1Desk, need you enroute to blah blah address, in reference to a domestic, armed suicidal subject...\" He repeats his dispatch and gets a \"Uh, Dispatch? I have no vehicle.\" He acknowledged, \"10-4, per GPS you're my closest unit, need you enroute.\" A couple others voiced up and took the call and he got called back into the office for his radio traffic. \"He was the closest unit, check the logs...\" They asked him why he didn't use common sense and he of course threw it back in their face, \"I was told not to use common sense.\"\n\n\nBonus, a different co-worker was also chastised over her use of GPS, so she dispatched several marine boat units to a domestic in progress call due to GPS. Shortly after these two events they changed the guidelines on GPS usage on unit selection.\n\nEdit: Marine Units are bay craft, not US Marines.",

Well one day I go in and my boss tells me that someone in admin complained to him that I hadn’t been vacuuming and that they hadn’t even seen me the whole time I was there.  I explained that I just waited until they were all gone before I went in so I wouldn’t bother anyone and he completely understood, but told me to fix it.\n\nSo starting that day the first thing I would do when I got to work was go and vacuum the admin offices.  Someone on the phone?  Not my problem I have to vacuum.  Someone dealing with a patient?  Can you scoot over, I need to vacuum under your desk.\n\nThis went on for about a week before someone in admin asked me if I could wait until they were gone before I came and cleaned.  I told them I’d love to, but my boss had told me I needed to get around to cleaning admin earlier than I used to and they would have to talk to him.  Another week of me cleaning and vacuuming like this and my boss came up to me with a bis smile on his face and told me I didn’t have to worry about doing admin first anymore because someone had complained about how much noise I was making and asked him if I could just wait until they were gone before I cleaned.\n\nIts been almost a year and I haven’t heard anything from any of the admin people since.",

I try not to take his lectures to heart as he could find a hundred things wrong at any given moment, but this one was particularly overly critical and upset a couple people. We all had a laugh about the lunch thing though because we had actually only taken about a 25 minute lunch in favor of not being lectured about not helping out. \n\nYou guessed it: we are now timing our lunches to be exactly half an hour as well as making sure to take our union breaks (which we always skipped or counted as our brief downtime before. One of my coworkers loudly declared we still had 10 minutes and held up her phone with the timer the other day.\n\nMoral of the story: he should think about maybe limiting his battles to ones that actually benefit him to win.

They let their dog run lose so we’re always scared we’re gonna hit him. They were once trimming their hedges and cut our cable line and refused to get it fixed. The parents let their kids do whatever the hell they want. Their dog shits on our lawn and they don’t pick it up. The dad drives so fast on the street he’s bound to kill someone one day. The mom bitches about my mom behind her back. You get the point.\n\nRecently, their thing has been that they BLAST their music when they’re in their backyard. And when I say blast, I mean you can hear it from our end of the street all the way to the other end. It’s insane. And this can be at 11am or at 11pm. It’s constant.\n\nNow that you have the background, we fast forward to today. At 1pm, their music starts. Insanely loud, but whatever, it’s during the day, let them have their fun. I go to work, come back, and my mom is freaking out. She has work tomorrow morning, my brother has to be up at 5 and it’s 11pm. Their music is somehow louder than before, we can hear it in our house.\n\nAt this point, I’m fucking over it. They have been such shitty neighbors, and this is the last straw. So, we call public security. They tell us that they can only send an officer if we would be willing to testify against them in court should that be necessary. Okay, that’s a bit extreme, whatever, we’ll deal with it.\n\nI walk over and see that my neighbors son’s shitty 16 year old friends are outside. Okay, whatever, I ignore them and go to the front door.\n\nShitty friend: are you complaining about the noise?\n\nMe: ya\n\nShitty friend: bitch.\n\nI ignore him, knock on the door, and the mom answers. She says I scared her because she thought I was the police (bitch so you know you’re being horrible???????) I explain that it’s too loud, I called the police already, she apologizes, should be the end of it.\n\nShitty friend: wait you called the police? \n\nMe: Yup. I know you guys have a shit ton of weed on you so I doubt you want me to have to do that again, so keep it down.\n\nShitty friend: why don’t you call the police again bitch.\n\nAt this point I was basically back at my front door but I was like nah, you don’t have the upper hand here, shitty 16 year old.\n\nMe: okay sure.\n\nI pull out my phone, dial public security, and show them my screen as it’s ringing.\n\nMe: hi, I called a few minutes ago about a noise complaint, but I actually just went over and not only is their music insanely loud, but there is a lot of underage drinking and -\n\nI have never seen a group of people scatter so fast.",

        "text": "I’m not sure if this belongs here, but given the amount of stories regarding landlords maybe it does. I found it funny/satisfying anyway.\n\nI will preface this story by explaining that we pay $630 AUD per week in rent for a 2 bedroom apartment  (not an insignificant amount) and that prior to this we had numerous broken things in the apartment including the aircon, stove top and front door that were all a battle to get fixed. The owner is a radiologist and clearly has plenty of money, just doesn’t like to part with it. \n\nSo our dryer went kaput. I notified the real estate immediately. In our building you are not allowed to hang washing on your balcony so a functioning dryer is kind of essential. Real estate replies and sets up a time for the owner to come and install a “new” dryer. \n\nThe day comes and the owner turns up with a mate to install the dryer. Clearly he is too cheap to pay someone to do it. Fine, no worries. The dryer they bring with him is possibly the oldest dryer I have ever seen in my life. Clearly well used and full of dust and crap. I internally sigh, but what can I do. It gets installed and they leave.\n\nThis dryer is the worst thing I have ever used. When on, it makes this constant banging sound (like if you put a pair of shoes in the dryer and they bang around, but make the sound metal on metal). We can’t use the dryer without closing the door because it’s so damn loud. This creates condensation all over the walls because it gets so hot in there. The lint filter (which is some old kind that sits on the front of the dryer) keeps falling off while the dryer is on, so of course there is lint and dust absolutely everywhere in the laundry, even coating the already moist walls. If you leave the door open then lint and dust spews out into the apartment and the hellish sounds it makes drive you insane.\n\nSo I send a polite email to the real estate explaining the issues with it and the fact I have allergies and the extra dust isn’t helping and request the dryer is replaced to something from this decade. I get an equally polite response of no in return. \n\nI tolerate this demonic piece of shit dryer for another 6 months at least until it now starts continually overheating, even when used on the cool setting. There is lint everywhere in the laundry. It’s like the walls have lint psoriasis. There is also mould forming on the ceiling above the dryer. \n\nI send another email to the real estate. This time  I include photos of the mould, the trails of water down the walls and the thick layers of lint/dust coating the top and back of the dryer and the walls. I politely state that I know the owner has refused to replace the dryer, so I am sending this email simply to formally state in writing my concern that the dryer is a fire hazard in a 16 floor apartment building, because of all the overheating and dust and moisture and that it is causing mould damage to the ceiling. I state in said email that I take no responsibility for any damage or potential loss of life related to the dryer malfunctioning, given that I have notified them and I will be keeping a record of this notification and the photos. If he chooses not to replace it, then all damage is his responsibility. \n\n5 days later I had a brand new dryer delivered and installed and God damn it felt good!!!",

This company had many policies which were very odd and over time I found quite a few workarounds in order to make sure that I was able to get my job done, the kids had fun, and things were even educational at times. One of those policies was that nothing could be used which depicted violence, so no water pistols or anything like that. Not super surprising or particularly problematic. However, during a walk through with an area manager we were having a game day and I was playing Hangman with some of the kids. I was informed by the Area Manager that Hangman depicts death and violence and is not to be played at the child care facility.\n\nWell...the kids really did like Hangman, and it does work on letter recognition, spelling, and other basic reading skills. So, cue up the Disappearing Girl. On the whiteboard I would draw a lovely picture of a little stick figure girl complete with a big smile on her face. I also came up with a lovely background story about how she was a Scientist and in an experiment gone horribly wrong she activated a machine that is slowly phasing her body out of existence and if the kids can't find the proper message to put in the computer she will blink out of existence forever. As she starts losing body parts from her feet and moving up, her facial expression went from happy, to concerned, to scared, to crying with terror as she was reduced to a floating head. Then, those facial features began to disappear too.\n\nThe kids loved this new version of the game and would gladly explain the story behind it. The Area Manager's face was two feet and one leg erased level of concerned looking as she listened to how the game worked. I was in complete compliance, as nothing violent at all was occurring in our game.",

        "text": "Disclaimer: More of an aider in a malicious request.\n\n**Background:**\n\nI worked retail for 5+ years at a large consumer electronics company that I shall refer to as Pear for convenience. We sold pPhones, pPads, and pBooks on the floor to customers.\n\nDue to the popularity of the products and the location of our store in a busy mall, the floor can get quite packed during the day with people going in and out. To add fuel to the fire, the store has a set of low wooden tables installed at the rear that are equipped with little black bean-bag chairs and pPads so that kids are can come in and get addicted to games on the pPads while their parents did their shopping and troubleshooting. Some parents even would intentionally drop off their kids in the store and go off shopping on their own, as if we're a daycare. Seating in the store is limited, so sometimes parents would sit on a set of couches directly outside while their kids were playing inside. If we can't locate the parent, we would call security and they would have to make an announcement in the mall that there were unsupervised children left at the store and the parents are required to pick them up immediately.\n\n**Story:**\n\nOn a busy Sunday, the store was relatively short-handed at noon (a few guys called in sick and another few were on lunch), and I was on the floor with my store manager. Two of my colleagues were deep into their sales conversations with customers and it leaves me open to float on the floor and answer other customer questions. I was just greeting somebody at the door when a little kid holding an ice cream cone (5-6 years old boy) SPRINTS full speed into the store and guns it to the back where the kids table was. As he runs by I try to call out to him and ask him to slow down but he didn't seem to care about anything happening around him.\n\nWhen he got to the kids table, he puts down his ice cream cone and picks up a pPad and tries to unlock it. The pPad shows the Pear logo and is turning on, but the kid doesn't seem to get this and starts screaming \"ITS NOT WORKING!!!.\" He then gets up, proceeds to knock over his ice-cream cone on the table, making a huge mess, and runs up the store to my colleague who is near the front of the store (currently helping another customer) and barges in the conversation and just screams at my colleague \"ITS NOT WORKING!!!.\" I go over to help my colleague, who is obviously annoyed and flustered and I ask the kid where his parents are. He points to a woman on the couch outside and I said \"is that your mom?\" He nods and I tell him \"if you run around the store like that you'll get hurt. I'll get the pPad working for you in a second if you just go back to the table and wait for ...\"\n\nBefore I could finish my sentence, the kid starts bolting down the hallway again and misses a few customers while I walk out to the bench outside to talk to the mom. I said to her \"Sorry ma'am, is that your son?\" She said \"Yes it is,\" looking relatively smug and nonchalant about the whole thing. I told her that she can't leave her kid in the store alone, and that he's probably going to get hurt running up and down the aisle. The lady looks like she's getting upset and says \"Are you kidding me? That's what they do. Kids run.\"\n\nAt this point I turn around and see the kid to salvaging his ice cream from the table and splatters it all over his hands. He  starts to run blindly from table to table, wiping the ice cream on the table legs and the devices as if finger painting. He finds renewed joy in this, and seems to have lost interest in the pPad already. Other customers were noticing the kid and trying to ignore or avoid him altogether, since he was a huge mess and being a nuisance. My manager finally notices from the back of the store and radios in \"what the heck is going on?\" I told him the situation and the conversation with the mom, and saw him look over at her (who returned a glare to my manager as if we wronged her). He paused for a second, then looked at the boy, and said \"Just help other customers, I'll deal with it.\"\n\nSo I came came back into the store and watched as my manager slowly walked towards the boy, who stood at the back left table. He was dangling a pPad precariously off the side of the table by its security cord, with a giant happy-face drawn on the screen with ice-cream. As the boy finishes messing it up, he eyed the other table across the store on the back right, which had a bunch of expensive pBookPros on it and begins to sprint across the store to get to them.\n\nAs he ran, I saw my manager, who was now positioned between the tables where the kid was travelling between, take a soft but dexterous step into the path of the kid and planted his feet firmly on the ground. My manager's eyes were still glued to his pPad as if he was reading something important. The kid had his face turned the other way as he ran, so he didn't see the new obstacle that was in front of him.\n\nThen I witnessed, as if in slow motion, the kid turning his head back around and his eyes widen as he pelted full speed into the leg of my manager. The impact created an uncannily loud WHAM sound and sends the kid falling backwards. His remaining ice cream cone flew through the air, landing an aisle over. As the kid fell back, his legs soften and his head narrowly misses a table leg not more than 3 inches away. He hits the ground with an audible THUD. Everybody is caught by surprise by the sound of the impact and looked over. There was about 3-4 seconds of pure, awkward silence in the store, followed by heavy, sniffled breathing and loud crying coming from the kid.\n\nThe mom, who just then realized that her kid was the one crying, came running into the store. She had a look of shock on her face, and looked around the store in disbelief before picking the kid up. The kid couldn't stop crying and the mom carried him out of the store without saying a single word or looking back at us.\n\nI walked over to my manager and asked him if he thought the kid was okay. He looked at me, shrugged, and said \"Kids fall.\"",

        "text": "I’ve been lurking on the page for a long time and it’s reminded me of my own tale of malicious compliance from over two years ago. \n\n**If you're on the loo, settle in for a long one otherwise there is a tl;dr at the bottom**\n\nI need to start by saying that I live in the UK and that the UK is very friendly towards tenants thanks to the local councils (this will obviously become important later).\n\nSo myself and two friends started renting from a landlord, let’s call him Mr Muppet for now, through a letting agent, let’s call them Fuxtons. We moved into a large 3 bed flat split between ground floor and lower ground in a good part of London. It all started off well until late winter when, as I’m sure the whole world is aware, it rained in London (shock). Unlike most flat, someone had decided that making this flat waterproof was not necessary, either because they thought it would never rain in London or they were just really bad at their job. Anyway, I digress. My housemate on the lower ground floor had a light well next to his room, great for letting light in, but also great for letting water in. After a few days of heavy rain, a rather large wet patch had worked his way across the floor. Things weren’t much better upstairs with water coming through the light fitting in the Kitchen offering anyone passing a real fry up in the morning. Additionally a large stain was creeping across the ceiling (clearly from the flat roof above, again another bright idea from the architect).\n\nSo with a swamp downstairs resembling the Everglades, a Russian roulette light fitting and the impending threat of a convertible kitchen we thought it best to contact Mr Muppet. \n\nMr Muppet lived in Australia but I am still fairly sure that they have internet there. So after two weeks of emailing and no response we decided to email the letting agent Fuxtons, just in case they had a phone number for him. They contacted him and confirmed with us that a contractor would be on the way in the next few days. Excellent. A week comes and goes and nothing. \n\nWith my housemate now wearing wellies to get from the door of his room to his bed we feel it might be best to contact Fuxtons again. They give some rubbish back about the landlord being in Sydney and he organised a contractor blah blah blah. But we know he’s not bothered to spend any money fixing the issue. Fuxtons say there’s nothing they can do, and we should just organise it ourselves. Hmmm, interesting as we’re not allowed by law to conduct work on our property without consent, nor is the Landlord allowed to order us to carry out or organise work. \n\nHowever, if they want us to organise it ourselves, we shall. After all they hadn’t specified what they wanted us to organise. \n\nNow in the UK local councils are very friendly towards tenants and there are laws saying that they have to ensure that there is a duty of care and safety to the occupants. They also offer a lovely service where they will, for free, come and inspect the property at the request of a tenant (this is called a notice of disrepair). So we decided to take them up on this. But, we are nice tenants so we email Mr Muppet and Fuxtons to let them know that we are willing to organise for the council to inspect the property. This is met by an overwhelming silence from both parties. Cool, so they’re clearly both on board. \n\nThe lovely man from the council shows up and does the assessment. Now the UK loves a good law or two so when the council is involved they will take a note of everything. And I really mean **EVERYTHING**. Going from the cracked tile under the basin, the slightly wobbly handrail on the stairs to the massive wet stain in the bedroom. They will also sign off what is the fault of the tenants and the fault of the landlords (seeing as we were new to the property, everything was under his section). \n\nThe next thing is, when this report is conducted the Mr Muppet must start the work within 14 days and complete it within 53 days. So when he was emailed this report he had no recourse but to complete the works or receive an £800 fine per item that wasn’t addressed. Unfortunately for him, when he had signed the contract with us he had stipulated that there is a two month break clause that rolled from the forth of each month. Which meant he couldn’t get rid of us for a minimum of 70 days…oops. This meant Mr Muppet had to do the work even though we’d be vacating the property just 10 days after they were finished (yes we'd timed it to make sure he had to complete the work). Oh and to add further insult to injury, during this time because of the disturbances of the work we got a rent adjustment so we paid less.\n\nBy the end he had to replace every door for a certified fire door (on specific hinges), add handrails in all the bathrooms, reseal the ceiling, doors and floors in all the rooms, re-tile two bathrooms with anti slip tiles, fix the broken parts of both staircases, address all the mould growth in the apartment and clean every inch of it with disinfectant as well as nearly 50 other tiny jobs. \n\nSo we enjoyed our last 10 days in this newly finished flat but moved into a better place with an amazing landlord. \n\nOh and to cap it all off, during the inspection the council realised he hadn’t paid for a licence to have three people living there so he got fined as well…oops, guess he should have just fixed the walls when we gave him the multiple opportunities…\n\nTl;dr we tell our landlord about water coming in through the walls and ceiling and he tells us to sort it ourselves so we do by getting the council involved who find every minute detail of the property that is wrong. He has to spend a huge amount of money fixing everything else that was wrong with the property in just 53 days, for us to vacate just 10 days later.",

This lady had called in because one of her cable boxes wasn't working. It ended up being a very simple fix. She had rearranged her room and plugged the box into a switched outlet, the type where the top outlet works off a wall switch for a desk or floor lamp, while the bottom outlet is live all the time. \n\nShe was not convinced that was the problem. She demanded the cable box be swapped out. I'm not one for argument so I gave her a new one. But that wasn't the end of the story. She demanded a refund for her inconvenience and our shitty equipment. Per company protocol I didn't have the authority to do that. I give her my supervisors number. \n\nA few days go by and I had forgotten all about it. My boss calls me in to ask about the situation. I tell him the whole story. He says thanks and sends me on my way. He calls me back in the next day. I come in and he has a huge grin on his face.\n\nBoss-\"I spoke with your customer\"\n\nMe-(sarcastic)\"great. And?\"\n\nB-\"she hates you, and now me. She demanded a refund just like you said. I told that we aren't liable for her not knowing how her house electrical outlets work. I offered her free HBO or some pay per view coupons (about a $25 value)  She wasn't having it l, so I gave in and asked her how long her 1 of 5 cable boxes was without service.\"\n\nCustomer-\"idk probably 10-12 hours\"\n\nB-\"ok. Let's do the math. Your bill divided by 30, divided by 5 equals X amount per box per day. Now divide that by 24 hours equals X amount per hour. Now times that by 12 hours of no service equals X. Ma'am you will be seeing a $.78 refund on your next bill. Have a good day\"\n\n",

        "text": "Years ago, I worked at a company that did catalog orders and fulfillment (shipping) for several different companies. One was a catalog that sold a particular collectible doll, along with her sister and \"boyfriend\", exclusively.\n\nEach year, the holiday versions would cause the phone line to jump to 150 calls waiting as long as 90+minutes to place an order. I could hit refresh on our inventory numbers and watch them go as fast as 5 or 6 per second. We had a limit of one doll per customer/address to let as many people as possible get a shot. Once we sold all we were going to get before Christmas, we had to backorder and would tell the customer this. Frequently, they would ask to speak to a supervisor, so that was me.\n\nOne call, a lady was screaming at me about how her child would not get her $135 doll before Christmas. After about 5 minutes of her ranting (or venting if you want to be nice) she said she would put her daughter on and I could tell her there is no Santa. I then asked her the child's name so I could address her properly and if she wanted me to tell her a doll would be coming before the new year.\n\nAt that point, she realized that I would have helped if I could but I was TOTALLY willing to pop that Santa bubble, as that kid needed to know you can't have everything right when you want it. She declined my offer, confirmed the order and shut up then.\n\nBTW- We had a supervisor with the last name Barbee and she took great satisfaction in telling people her name when they were acting a fool because they assumed she was lying. I also had an 87 year old grandmother of 3 wish that I would die because she could only get one doll. Those people were NUTS. \n\nEdit: dang it misspelled the title, one thing I can't edit. ",

        "text": "A former coworker of mine and her husband (J and J) got into flipping houses in the late 90s. They bought a tavern from the late 1800s that had been previously converted into a six-plex and was in desperate need of updates, upgrades and code compliance. \n\nThere were two empty units including a massive one that the husband's brother and I would occupy. The other they immediately gutted and renovated and rented out. The renovations were beautiful and, with the upgrades, the asking price for rents went up. Over a couple of years, when someone's lease was up and moved out, J and J would gut the unit, and completely redo everything bringing everything up to code. (that's an important part of the MC later)\n\nImmediately after buying the building, the tenant directly below mine started causing trouble and tried establishing dominance over J and J. They were a mother and 40ish son that shared a one bedroom (matching twin beds). I don't recall exact details, but they were rude, demanding and a nuisance in every way. They constantly argued with J and J about costs, and upkeep and new tenants and parking and what not. Their unit had not been renovated yet  because they were still occupying it under some sort of longer than usual lease from the previous owner. (I don't any more detail than that... sorry, I heard all of this from my roommate.)\n\nOne day, J and J get a call from the city stating a tenant complaint would require an inspection. Now, J and J had been good landlords. They would fix and replace anything in need, never were too demanding of anyone, but they weren't going to be pushed around and these tenants were trying to be bullies and resisting the changes that J and J were implementing. They meet the inspector at the unit. The inspector points out the deficiency and claims that you can't have someone living in these conditions and it needed to be repaired immediately. The smug look on the mother and son lasted all of five seconds when either J or J (can't remember which) said, I guess you'll have to find a new place to live. You're evicted. It was very satisfying. Sorry I don't have any further details. This happened in 1999 and I heard it second hand. \n\nEdit 01: I don't think that mom and son had a signed lease and were actually living month to month. I seem to remember something about the lay-in ACT ceiling being the reason for the call. I know they moved out less than a month later. The fact that they were mother/son sharing a one bedroom with two twin beds wasn't relevant to the story and I shouldn't have included it. I'm leaving it in because the discussion below is interesting and hopefully educational. If you really wanted to know where this took place, you could probably figure it out with a little digging but I'm not offering it up. ",

        "text": "During my fourth year at my university I had a to take a genetics class to fulfill a major requirement. Well the class was full of seniors and I was taking another year to get a second major to make my application look good for grad school. Well the class originally started out with this guy that looked like Peter Griffin, seriously he did look like him. The class would meet Tuesdays and Thursdays for 75 minutes. After about three week Peter would miss every Thursday and complain about driving so far. Peter also sent out rude emails which got back to my adviser who was the head of the department. Peter ultimately left. \n\nThe class needed a professor and lucky for us they had hired a professor for the following year that agreed to start and finish the class. As soon as he came in he boasted about going to Harvard and completing a fellowship at Stanford. So lets call this guy Mr. Ivy League.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks we found out that Mr. Ivy League was kind of rude and no body really liked him. He had his favorites and it was obvious. There was a group project that I had with a guy and girl. The girl ended up cussing us out and calling us incompetent. During our group write-up I wrote this down. Well Mr. Ivy League said that I should not have said this about a group member and docked me two 2 points. I was pissed and annoyed. Up until this point I was nice to him while everyone complained about him. I went to my adviser to talk about it and she said just talk to him. At that point it was two weeks before the end of the semester and I was done with Mr. Ivy League. \n\nLike most colleges, we have a end of the year course evaluation. Mr. Ivy League tells us to be honest with our evaluation. That he will take the feedback and consider what he needs to change. Well everyone did write a completely honest evaluation...To the point that some had to use another sheet of paper to voice their evaluation. Everyone wrote how he had favorites and would dock people down points for questioning him. He would also say condescending remarks to us. So I wrote a truthful eval. It was the most harsh, longest, and detailed evaluation that I have wrote, I pulled specific days and examples. When I was finished I felt bad and contemplated throwing it out and getting another sheet, but I said fuck it and turned it in. \n\nWhen I talked to my adviser once finals were over I asked how his evaluations went. She looked at me with this awkward smile and said \"he has a lot to work on for next year.\" I was laughing so hard and she just looked at me and sighed. The next year I had him for a class and that is another post that would be fun to read. Anyway I graduated from there in 2017. Last year my sister had him for her genetics class too and she said that everyone wrote him a bad evaluation, even the most nicest girl wrote him a harsh evaluation.  ",

We just had some corporate restructuring, leaving no one to look after the front desk.  We'd always have a bit of a rush at around 10AM, and my office work would suffer as I looked after all the customers coming in.  Needless to say, I was getting pretty pissed off with my co-worker, who, despite also being scheduled for 4AM - Noon, would always take off at 9AM because there was \"no work left for him to do.\"\n\nI asked this co-worker to stick around and help me with the 10AM rush.  He said no.  So I complained to the boss.  The boss came out to our office, and told my co-worker that he had to start sticking around until noon.  \n\nFirst day after this meeting, the 10AM rush rolls around, and my co-worker is nowhere to be found.  When the rush dies down I go and I find him...napping in his office.  I wake him up and ask him what he's doing.  He flashes a smug grin.  \"The boss only said I have to stay in the office until noon.  He didn't say WHAT I had to do, and he DEFINITELY didn't say I had to help you.\"  \n\nSo, then, every day at 9AM, when he'd normally take off, he'd make a big performance about going down for a nap in his office.  \"I'm just staying in the office, like the boss said!\" he'd say as part of the show.  So I complained again.  The boss came out again.  The boss had a good chuckle at how my co-worker was exploiting this loophole, and my co-worker could start taking off early at 9AM again.  \n\nLesson learned.  Expect no help.  ",

        "text": "Was 15, at Burger King, following the orders on the little screen and making the corresponding Whoppers and Chicken Sandwiches. One came up “XTRA XTRA MAYO” which was unique in my experience. Just regular XTRA mayo was a huge ass amount of mayo. Then they announced it over the speaker too, which was the custom, but they did it in an annoying way. Extra, EXTRA Mayonnaise.  So I built a sandwich that had a full inch of mayonnaise on it. On a six inch chicken sandwich, that was like twelve square inches of mayonnaise. I carefully floated the bun on top and wrapped it up really carefully. I folded the top edge over like a ribbon along the top, and wrapped the triangles around the bottom, then cut the whole thing in half, wrapped it nicely again, and cradled it into its paper box. It held together quite nicely; it was just really high inside the box. I carefully closed the lid on it because it fit really snugly, and I slid the box into the metal thing and forgot about it. \n\nIt was brought back to me later, after the customer returned it to the store. The manager, the same one who had made the announcement, explained to me very sadly and disappointedly, “This is just TOO much mayonnaise”. \n\nSorry!\n\nEdited to clarify that I didn’t just make a huge messy sandwich. I made a perfectly intact, double-wrapped sandwich-shaped mayonnaise loaf that the customer received and tried to eat. ",

I really wanted to laugh but I had to maintain my angry look to back up my brother. \n\nEDIT: added extra detail to the story to avoid confusion. ",

        "text": "I apologize because this post is kind of long but hopefully you all enjoy it.\n\nAt one point in my life I worked at a really high end tool manufacturing company. This company was relatively small and for a niche market but people in that market absolutely loved these tools and still do. Every once in a while the company would do special runs of tools that they took pre-orders for and only made a small amount of extras so they could sell them at trade shows as well or use them for warranties. These special run tools would then be made and shipped out months later due to manufacturing time. So I worked in the customer service department. My typical day involved processing orders and listening to customers complain about orders being late or something not being correct with their order. You know typical customer service gig.\n\nWell one day I got a call from a customer who called in regularly, this particular customer was very sketchy. He always wanted to change his payments to different credit cards or change the shipping address but his payments always went through and no complaint was ever filed about this customer with us. However this particular customer was really rude so nobody liked to talk to him.\n\nAs I said I got a call from this particular man and he said \"I need all of my orders on file changed to this new credit card number.\" The problem was that all of the orders were made online with an encryption that didn't show us the number and would not allow us to change the credit card number unless we were going to process the order. There was no way for me to blanket change all of his orders and he had at least 20 orders on file as he ordered something almost every week. He had thousands of dollars worth of tools on order and some of them were those special run tools that were a limited quantity. I explained to him that I couldn't change the payment type on all of his orders because they weren't ready to be processed.\n\nHe immediately started yelling at me and wanting to talk to a manager. I put him on hold called, my boss's extension and told him the situation. My boss knew the customer's reputation and how much of an ass he was so he told me to just politely tell him that no manager is available and then I could deal with him however I wanted. I loved my old boss because he let me kind of treat a disrespectful customer the way I wanted to.\n\nSo this is where I start thinking of how I'm gonna deal with this jackass. When I get back on the phone with him before I can even say a word he starts yelling at me telling me \"If you can't do it cancel it.\" This was it this was perfect I told him \"Alright I'll take care of it for your sir.\" Then I told him to have a nice day and hung up the phone. After I hung up the phone I cancelled all of his orders and put a comment in each order saying \"cancelled per customer request\" with the date, time, who he talked to(me) and the reason why he had them cancelled.\n\nMove forward a couple weeks later and he calls up again and to my luck I answered the phone. He was furious as to why his latest order hadn't shipped and why it was so late. A giant smile crossed my face when I asked for his order number. He told me his order number and I told him that the order had been cancelled per his request. He got even more upset and told me that he never cancelled his order and wanted to talk to a manager. So I put him on hold and immediately walked to my boss's office and told him he needed to talk to the guy I put on hold but I asked if he could do it on speaker phone with me there. Like I said my boss was super cool and he said sure. So he answers the phone and this customer goes crazy saying how he never cancelled an order and that he needs this tool. My boss calmly told him that his order had been cancelled and read my comment to the customer. My boss understood exactly what happened and got a smile on his face too.\n\nMy boss tells this guy that he can reorder this particular order(this order wasn't a special run tool order) but the shipping date would be much later because of the item being on back order. The guy decided he could get a similar tool somewhere else and wasn't going to give us the business which my boss really didn't care about because the guy was a jackass. After that he asked when his next order was going to ship because that was a special run tool that other companies didn't make so he really wanted that one. He gave my boss the order number for that one and to his surprise it was also cancelled. He freaked out yelling and just making an ass of himself. He asked why this order had been cancelled and was furious to find out. He asked about his other orders and to his distress found them all to have been cancelled.\n\nHe starts yelling at my boss, but my boss was a no bullshit kind of guy and flat out told the customer that he shouldn't have told his employee to cancel his orders and that if he was gonna act that way they would cancel all future orders.\n\nTLDR basically a jackass customer told me to cancel his orders if I couldn't change his payment methods. I couldn't change his payment methods because of how our system was set up so I cancelled all of his orders including special run items.\n\nEdit: I won't say the company I used to work for because I don't work there anymore but I will say that some of the comments are quite good at guessing.",

Also it was free admission because it was a campground run by the DNR. Weekdays would have 10-20 visitors total, weekends were a bit busier, but still not much.\n\nThis particular day, nobody was on the beach. My manager and I were playing cards in the guard house. Unfortunately four other highschool kids showed up and one of us would have to go watch them... I drew the short straw :(\n\nSidenote, we had three cardinal rules:\n\n1. Don't kill yourself\n2. No going past the deep water rope without passing a swim test\n3. No inflatables past the deep water rope ever\n\n\\#2 was so little kids wouldn't inadvertently break rule #1.\n\n\\#3 was because the wind would blow things away, people would try to chase them down, and we'd have to break out the kayak to keep them from breaking rule #1 the middle of the lake.\n\nBack to these four guys, they immediately walked the the far end of the 100 yard beachline, and hid behind a tree down there. The entrance and main beach were 30 yards wide, the other 70 yards were just kinda the overflow. So I knew something was up right away. They obviously went down there to get away from me. I assumed they just wanted to smoke/drink without getting in trouble. As long as it didn't break our three cardinal rules, I didn't care. The DNR could enforce the law, I enforced my three rules.\n\nFor about 20 minutes, they were staying behind the tree, and in my opinion being perfect little angels not breaking my rules... Then their evil plan emerged from behind the tree. They had brought four inflatable \"adult dolls\" with them and had spent the last 20 minutes blowing them up. I started laughing my ass off. They swam down with them and told me \"We're not going to take them past the rope!\" I couldn't argue with that logic.\n\nAfter a while my manager came out to take her turn... she was not impressed :( She gave me grief, and I said they were not breaking any rules. She called the DNR (edit - Department of Natural Resources / Park Rangers) , and they told her the guys were not breaking any laws. She had to sit there for the next half hour watching these guys play frisbee while riding inflatable dolls. Good times :)",

I always told the people at the lone window to call me if they had a difficult customer because I didn't want them to feel intimidated being all by their lonesome in a tiny space, in a lightly trafficked area.\n\nWell, my grumpiest, most difficult employee was always rubbing people the wrong way, and we had a huge meeting where I had to tell her that her job was on the line. In the future, I needed her to be rainbows and kittens and to call me before anything went sideways.\n\nSo, two hours later, she calls me with this saccharine tone in her voice and said she needed me to help a customer. So, I make my long way to her tucked away corner, and this customer is towering over her and screaming with spittle flying out the corners of his mouth. My employee is literally pressed up against the filing cabinets to get as far away from him as she can.\n\nIrate customer wants us to find out what the VIN was on a vehicle he owned in 1955. Then, he wants to know who owns that car. So, for part 1, finding the VIN, we can do a records search on Microfilm for $10/hour plus $10 for the record. He has to provide a credit card in advance and authorization to charge up to X hours for searching. He doesn't care how long it takes. He just wants it now and he's going to wait for it. We had about 40,000 rolls of poorly indexed microfilm so he could be looking at an entirely unreasonable charge. Oh, and he wants to wait for it.\n\nAs for who currently owns the car, we would have to find every instance of that car's registration to find the last known registration, but we never microfilmed registration until 1996, so it's unlikely that we could locate it. On top of that, we won't give out that person's information without certain criteria being met-- none of which this guy satisfied.\n\nSo I walk up to this angry dude and he turns on me and starts to yell at me. I hold my hand up like I'm a traffic cop and say, \"Sir, I am absolutely going to help you, but I could help you faster if we used calm, quiet voices.\" To my utter surprise, he stopped yelling, but he began insisting that my employee be fired right now. I explained that we have a disciplinary ladder that we follow and I will absolutely have my employee brought up for review. Then, I sent her to my desk with instructions to bring me the blue folder in my top left drawer.\n\nThen, I explained to the customer that I would need approximately 40 hours to locate his original VIN, assuming the film hadn't been destroyed by the ravages of time and assuming it was in the drawers I expected it to be in. I also guaranteed that he'd never have to work with that employee again. He signed off on an $800 authorization for time, and I told him I'd personally call him as soon as I reached the end of the 80 hours of search time or found his records.\n\nSo, he reluctantly left when I indicated that I needed to go find what was taking my employee so long to bring me my blue folder and discuss the discipline I'd promised.\n\nSo, I went to find my employee sitting in my chair with my blue folder. It was full of dove chocolates and a note I wrote to myself on my first day there: Everything will be okay.\n\nShe was holding the folder and looking confused and scared. She knew she was about to get fired after that asshole customer, but I reached over, grabbed a piece of chocolate, told her to help herself and plopped down in my guest chair. She started to apologize and I held my hand up again. I reiterated that we had just discussed my expectations that morning-- she was to call me immediately if she had any inkling that someone was going to be upset with her, which she did. She didn't engage, just called me and waited, which was exactly what she was supposed to do. I told her I had to write her up for following directions completely and document that her performance had improved immediately after our discussion and that I recommended an early end to her performance improvement plan. \n\nSo I sent a different employee to find the guy's records, which took about 25 hours. Then, I called the guy to explain that we found his VIN but that we were unable to find any other record of it after he bought it. We told him he could come down to pick up a copy of the record. The same employee he demanded to be fired was there when he came to pick up the record. She held one finger up to him to indicate that he should wait, closed her window, and called me. I personally walked down to deliver his record. He started yelling at me that I promised to fire the employee. I corrected him that I agreed to consider the disciplinary ladder and that he would never have to work with her again. Never did I promise to fire her. He left in a huff with his useless VIN from a vehicle that probably didn't even last 20 years before it got junked. \n\nAnd car junkies, it was some kind of MGA car which I had never heard of before that.\n\nEdit: my grammar sucks\nEdit 2: TL;DR: DMV customer demands employee be fired. DMV manager promises to take the appropriate disciplinary action and promises the customer will never work with particular employee again. Customer wrongfully assumes that means the employee is definitely getting fired. Instead, employee is rewarded for having to put up with DMV customer's asshattery. DMV customer never has to work employee again because manager insists on dealing with DMV customer herself, protecting her employee from continued abuse by the DMV customer.",

I obliged, except for the pack of tissues in my pocket.\n\nSo I sat down in the test area, put the headphones on and got on with the test. I tried to be conservative with the tissues as I only had a small packet, but soon I desperately needed to blow my nose. So I took out the packet, removed a tissue and relieved my horribly congested nose of all the fresh, juicy grossness that had built up in it.\n\nImmediately after, I felt a tap on my shoulder and turned to see the examiner stood there holding out his hand. He said, quite smugly, “You were previously asked to remove all personal artefacts and leave them in the locker provided,” or something along those lines. Something overly formal, like a typical bureaucrat. The point is he could plainly see I wasn’t cheating and that I had a genuine need for a large supply of tissues, but wanted to take them away regardless. So naturally I pressed - not placed - the now-saturated tissue directly into his outstretched hand, buttered-side down, with an audible splat. He grimaced, walked away, and at the end of the test I got it back in a plastic bag.",

She informed me she wanted him to count it, but he wasn't working that day. I told her this and she like sucks for you.

She then proceeds to get mad and pissy at me because I was taking too long and I am like, what the fuck, I wasn't the one who came here with 800+ pennies. We are both going to sit here while I count this and I am going to make sure this is 100&amp;#37; correct because if it is not, no entry for you. Also, wouldn't you know, when she interrupted me, I completely lost count and had to start all over. Now if it was at all busy, I wouldn't have even bother with her and told her to find another form of payment, but hey, I was stuck there for 8 hours anyways and had nowhere else to be. She, however, appeared to be in a rush.  ",

        "text": "Ok so I originally posted this in r/PettyRevenge but u/metalwarrior13 told me that it would probably fit better here.\n\nSo once upon a time I was a closer for a meat department in a grocery store. Now the closer is always the last one to leave, and is alone in the department for the last couple hours. One night a store manager, we can call him M came up to me around 8:30 and informed me that the shelves were out of ground beef. He was kind of new so I explained that being out of grind this late was normal because we would have to throw away whatever was left the next morning. He immediately became belligerent and told me it was unacceptable, and that the shelves should be fully stocked at all times. I tried to remain civil and explain again that if I ground anything now, it would not sell by the next morning and it would all be thrown out. M said he didn’t care and told me to go back and grind more. \n\nThis really pissed me off because doing a standard 60 pound grind would set me 45 minutes behind, plus I would have to disassemble and clean the grinder again. But through my gritted teeth I asked how much he wanted me to grind. M obviously had no idea how the meat department worked and just said to grind whatever I had. \n\n This is when my petty plan hatched in my brain. I smiled my evil smile and walked back into the cooler where the grinder was and basked in the glory of all 200 pounds of our remaining grind stock. Grinding it all would set me back roughly and hour and a half but it was worth it. It was almost 11 when I put out all of the grind. I quickly finished closing up the department and went home. \n\nSure enough at five in the morning I got a series of texts from the group chat my boss (A) set up. A was raging at the fact that we had to shrink (throw away product and forfeit profit) over 800 dollars AND we wouldn’t have more ground beef to sell until the shipment came in at noon. I texted A directly and told him that M forced me to grind whatever I had left at 8:30. \n\nI came in to work at two o’clock that day and A was still fuming. Once he saw me he told me to come with him and we went into the store leader’s (head honcho’s) office. A told me to explain what happened so I did. The store leader called in M who immediately denied that the conversation ever happened. Lucky for me, he had not yet learned where the store cameras are. All four of us went back to the security office and ran through the footage, which very clearly showed M gesturing toward the empty shelves and arguing with me. \n\nThe next fifteen minutes were filled with M being yelled at by both A and the store leader. I simply stood behind them and grinned at M, who could do nothing but glare back at me. \n\nTL:DR New floor manager told me to do something stupid. I warned him it was dumb but he told me to do it anyway. He got chewed out for it the next day.",

        "text": "Hey, please tell me if this is inappropriate for the sub and I'll post it elsewhere.\n\nI was living with my girlfriend and a roommate, and we split the cost of every bill evenly, even though each bill was in one person's name. Well, that was the idea, but I naively \"helped\" my girlfriend pay her part of the bills (i.e. paid completely for most of them). The rent was in my name, the electricity in my girlfriends', etc.\n\nWell I eventually got tired of her crap (arguments, smelly gerbils, not doing chores), and we broke up. It was messy. She took ages to move out, making sure to mooch every penny she could before leaving.\n\nWhen she left, I immediately started a new electricity account in my name. A week later, I got a letter of confirmation in the mail, but I also received the electricity bill for the last three months my ex was living with us. I opened it without thinking. We couldn't even pay it if we wanted to because the bill was in her name. I shot her a text:\n\nMe:  Yo, you got the electricity bill in the mail. It's 120 bucks so come pick up $40 from each of us.\n\nEx:    Um where's the other $40? We agreed I wouldn't pay bills after I move out. (as if she did before)\n\nMe:  You were still living here for the time period of the bill.\n\nEx:    This is bullshit, I'm not going to pay a thing. We had an agreement.\n\nMe:   Well... you can come over to get our part, or you can pay it alone.\n\nEx:    The way I see it, you can either bring the $120 to my place or have fun in the dark lol.\n\nMe:   You got me there!\n\nAt this point I realized that she doesn't know I started my own account with the electricity provider. She thought that by refusing to pay, the provider would cut our lights. Good way to mooch another $40 from us, right? But that's not quite what happened.\n\nA few weeks later, I received another letter from elec. company with her name on it. Probably a late payment warning. I sent her a text to tell her, and she responded, \"lol why are you so desperate to talk to me. You know what you have to do :)\"\n\nAnother letter came in for her. This one was probably late fees. I have to guess because I never opened them. I messaged her and she said, \"I thought I told you to never talk to me again.\"  As you wish, ma'am!\n\nMore letters arrived, but from a new address. I Googled the new sender's address and found that they were debt collectors. Scary stuff. It's too bad I couldn't say a word to her.\n\nNow about two or three months later, I received a phone call from my ex and I'm greeted by \"WHAT THE FUCC THESE PEOPLE ARE CALLING MY PARENTS' HOUSE I'VE GOT ALL THESE LATE FEES BAAHHHH DEBT COLLECTORS.\" I told her if she wants our part of the bill, she knows what to do :)\n\nRealizing that she had no other choice, she caved and came for the money. My roommate and I didn't give her a cent toward late fees, and I probably looked so fucking smug giving her my money for the last time.\n\nEDIT: Lots of people are saying I shouldn't have given her a cent. As u/shelchang eloquently put it: \"Not paying it would be a dick move. Way more satisfaction in letting someone else get screwed while you play by all the rules.\"",

        "text": "After discovering this sub, I recalled a story from a few months ago that I felt suited it! This will be long, I apologize!\n\nThis past year was my final year in University, and I had the great pleasure of working as one of two co-editors for my university's satirical newspaper. As we all know, print media has been dying a slow and painful death, and unfortunately our newspaper has not been immune to this. My co-editor and I believed that the best way to counter this was to host comedy-themed events throughout the academic year in order to get more name recognition and revenue for our paper. I came up with an event I am quite proud of. The idea was to host a satirical TED talk-themed event. To give you some idea of what this entailed, when the event happened I opened it by giving a 10 minute talk on \"how to lie to your friends about why you can't go out on Friday\". \n\n\nI named the event \"TEDxxx\", and played on the TEDx slogan \"ideas worth spreading\" with our own slogan, \"bullshit worth spreading\". We picked a date, booked a venue, and created a graphic to advertise the event. Our graphic did look a bit familiar, but was also very obviously not a TEDx graphic. One important thing to keep in mind is that in Canada, where I live and where I studied, parody and satire are protected under copyright law as \"fair use\".\n\n\nSoon after announcing our event, we received a facebook message on our paper's facebook page from some random person neither me or my co-editor knew. They told us they were part of the TEDx club of our university, that they weren't happy with our event, that they wanted us to cancel it, etc. etc. We suggested they send us an email, explaining that we would be happy to talk about it in a more professional setting, rather than on facebook. They were pretty uncompromising, and so we felt we needed to irk them somehow. We thought that being asked to act professional by a university level satirical newspaper would do the trick. \n\n\nRather than emailing us, the TEDx chapter decided to contact the clubs manager of our school and lodge a very long series of complaints. Naturally, the clubs manager contacted us asking for a meeting, and we complied. I think the clubs manager was expecting us to be a couple of mean-spirited idiots, but we came there with the goal of making sure we were polite, respectful, and understanding because we really wanted our event to happen. We needed the clubs manager to see that we weren't breaking any rules or insulting anybody. \n\n\nThe clubs manager presented the complaints that this TEDx group had laid out. The short version is that in the eyes of the people running the official TEDx event at our university, our event was essentially being created to insult TED talks, the people running them, and the people performing at them (all of whom were just students like us). Funnily and by pure coincidence, the date we had picked to hold our event was also the date that the official TEDx club had planned to open registration for its own event. They assumed we were doing this to intentionally sabotage their event. Lastly, they told us our TEDxxx graphic was copying theirs, and asked us to change the graphic. They were and are associated with the official TEDx conferences, and so they said we were committing copyright infringement.\n\n\nI've talked to a lot of people about our event since it happened. I've yet to speak to anyone outside of my school's TEDx club who had interpreted our event to be anything other than harmless fun. My co-editor and I both believe that the people running TEDx had built up this event to be some prestigious thing, and had their egos bruised by our event. We wounded their pride, and they weren't happy. I think that sometimes in post secondary schools where admission is difficult, and where *for the most part* everyone is surrounded by equally smart people who deserve to be there, people tend to cling to little things they do with fierce pride - like, for example, running a TEDx conference. So, when that gets parodied, it hurts for the people running it. I get that, but I think the degree to which they took offense was such an overreaction!\n\n\nI shouldn't even need to say it here, but obviously our event had not been some grand attempt at insulting anybody performing in or planning the official TEDx conference. We were simply putting on a comedy show with a TED-talk theme. We explained as much to the clubs manager. She was pretty level-headed, and I think she was surprised to see that we were being so reasonable. We explained to the clubs manager that we had already booked our venue and advertised it for a specific night, and it would be so much less work for TEDx to change their registration date than for us to change the date of our actual event. We also explained that our event graphic had been designed by one of our paper's volunteers, and that our paper only met once a week. At the point when we met with the clubs manager, our event was only about a week away, and our paper's weekly meeting would only be a couple days before TEDxxx happened. We told her we could try and get the artist to make a new graphic, but that we couldn't do so for another few days and that it might not be worth the effort. We also explained that since the artist was a volunteer, we couldn't obligate him to make a new graphic on such short notice, we could only ask. The clubs manager was totally understanding and awesome about everything. She told us she was convinced and she wouldn't make us call off our event or change the date, though she said we should try to change the graphic if we could. She told us to just send an email to the TEDx directors telling them everything we had told her. She also asked us to make an announcement on our facebook event explaining that we respected TEDx and all that. \n\n\nHere was our announcement on facebook: \"To address any TEDxxx concerns and questions: TEDxxx is not in any way affiliated with any TEDx, TEDx [school], or other TED talk events. We are our own independent event, and our purpose is not to bring down or degrade other TED talks on campus. We admire the work of students who are involved with TED talks, and we think their event is one worthy of your time and attention. Our own event simply exists to fill a different niche, and give students different performance opportunities; in comedy rather than rational thought.\" \n\nAs an aside, I think that being forced to make such an obvious statement harmed TEDx way more than us. People immediately recognized what happened. One person even commented \"holy fuck why are people so sensitive\". Nobody at the school had even thought there was a controversy before, but after we posted our statement it made the people at TEDx seem like they were making a big deal out of nothing. Next we emailed the TEDx directors. We sent them a long email, very politely explaining that we respect their event, and them, and everything else that you've already read. We weren't trying to sabotage them, etc. Not gonna post that, it was way too long. They didn't actually respond to our email, so for most of the week we assumed that they had realized they overreacted and decided to just let us have our event in peace. \n\n\nWhat happened next was just so out-of-proportion. It was frankly mean. They got the official TEDx lawyers involved! Now, you have to understand that both of our clubs were just students trying to put on events for our respective student services. I honestly bore them no ill-will. But they fucking threatened us with lawyers. We were just a tiny little student newspaper, putting on an event for 150 people a couple weeks before exam season. They were so offended by our event that they were prepared to have us sued by intellectual property lawyers. We got an email from the law firm two days before our TEDxxx event, asking us to take down our graphic. My co-editor felt that we had not infringed on the TEDx copyright thanks to being protected under parody. I agreed, but was concerned that we probably couldn't out-lawyer a law firm. After a bit of a panic and some righteous anger, we agreed that it would be easier and more fun to just maliciously comply. \n\n\nWe did change our promotional event photo... to two giant middle fingers. We sent them to the lawyers, letting them know we would agree to their demands in our infinite generosity. We announced on our facebook page that we had changed our event graphic in the hopes that no other clubs considered \"branding using images of hands\" to be intellectual property. We flipped off everybody at our event, and put up a giant projected image of two middle fingers for the entirety of the event, just to really own up to it. More drama ensued the day of, even involving someone from TEDx trying to spread rumours that our event had been moved to the Holiday Inn across town (lol), and then that it had been cancelled outright. We put those rumours to rest, and ended up having a profitable and successful night. In a night filled with jokes, our school's official TEDx club ended up being the biggest joke of all!\n\nTL;DR: As an editor for my university's satirical newspaper, we put on a satirical version of a TED-talk conference and called it TEDxxx. Following a lot of dumb drama, TEDx's official lawyers got involved, and asked us to change our promotional graphic. So, we changed it to two middle fingers, and got the last word. \n\n\nEDIT: [the updated graphic we used](https://imgur.com/A8ET8ve)\n\nEDIT 2: Yes, I get it, my editing skills are not infallible. I should point out this is reddit, **not** an article for my newspaper. Still, I should make it clear that being an editor for my student newspaper was about more than just editing grammar mistakes. The most important part of the job was encouraging my writers, helping them find their comedic voice, and generally helping them have fun and find a way to turn their venting into something funny and positive. Supporting other people in a positive way is something a few of you clearly haven't learned...",

Apparently kindergarten me was well schooled in malicious compliance, so I grabbed the biggest spoon I could find (a serving spoon), got a heaping spoonful of whipped cream, plopped it into a bowl, and proceeded to enjoy it with a regular spoon. My mom was mad when she caught me eating a bowl of the stuff after she said I could only have a spoonful, so I showed her the spoon. She didn’t get after me because I *had* done what she’d asked, just not what she’d meant. But, after that fateful night, she was always careful to specify “a *small* spoonful”.\n",

        "text": "Update at bottom of post\n\nI work at a CNC shop, and yesterday I got moved to a rotary surface grinder. Surface grinders are finnicky to get them precise. This morning, my manager asked me about some tolerances that weren't up to par. So I turned off the grinder, took my ear plugs out, and listened. Well, after I turned the grinder off, Mr. Jackwad cared about nothing else. He went on a rant about \"once you dress the wheel, you don't turn it off for anything. It doesn't matter if you are doing machine maintenance, or if you leave for lunch. It stays on. Never ever turn it off\". \n\nAfter a few minutes I just told him, \"Okay okay, I'll redress the wheel and leave it on. I'll check all the tolerances carefully. Got it?\" Jackwad seemed offended that I talked back at him. \n\nAt noon, he left without telling anyone. I didn't notice until about 3:00. When I was packing up at 3:50, my coworker on an adjacent machine reminded me to turn the grinder off. I politely informed him that I was never supposed to turn it off. I explained the situation and his response was just, \"I'm not getting involved if this goes bad\". \n\nI packed up and left at 4:00. That 10hp motor is still chugging along at 7000 RPM, with that perfectly dressed wheel you would never want to stop. Nobody will be there tomorrow. Shop opens at 6:30 AM on Monday, and I'm sure that I'll get a very kind clarification of what Jackwad meant when he said not to turn off the grinder. \n\nAnd yes, that grinder will still be running when I get back. Those things could run for weeks at a time. It's just going to be hot enough to boil water, and the wheel might fall apart (meaning explode, but nobody will witness it). \n\n\nUpdate: \n\nI'm kind of disappointed, but relieved in the outcome. Nobody mentioned it when I got there, and when I got to the grinder it was off. I thought, \"maybe I wasn't the last one to leave\", but then I tried to power it on. Turns out I blew the fuse. My manager found out, and I played dumb. \"I don't know, it worked when I turned it off Saturday\". Luckily we had a spare fuse. \n\nI pussied out a bit. I didn't mention what he said to him, and as far as he knows nothing happened. I'm relieved nothing bad happened. ",

This one regular I’ve only heard rumors about thus far appears ( she’s known for being beyond difficult). She always gets the same thing: medium coffee with ALL the flavor shots. Problem is a shot of all the flavor takes up about half the medium cup so you only get maybe half a cup of coffee but whatever not my drink. \n\nGive it to her, tell her have a good one, move on. somehow she manages to loop back around in line I’m guessing cutting about 7 or 8 people and is automatically screaming about how her coffee is made incorrectly and every time she comes here we don’t give her enough coffee. After about 5 minutes of yelling and holding up the line my manager pops in and is like sorry we’ll make it again. Looks at me to go do it again apologetically. \n\nHere’s where it gets spicy. This large donut/coffee chain has all the regular coffee flavors yknow French vanilla, hazelnut, etc. which is what we fill her disgusting cup with but we also carry other flavors for seasonal drinks and what not that are fruity like mango, strawberry, pineapple,etc.  I fill that medium cup with about 20% coffee and  and EVERY flavor just as the customer requested how can I not comply with the all mighty customer? As I’m looking at my concoction of hazelnut and strawberry mango coffee I know my boss won’t be happy but for my own sense of justice I had to. Hand it to the lady with my biggest smile said cya later.\n \nSAME FUCKIG THING skips the people she literally just skipped to come back screaming in the window about how we’re all incompetent and she’s never coming back.\n\nSuccess.jpg\n\nTold manager my dark deed she was pissed bc of health risks maybe she was allergic to fruit or whatever which I didn’t think about at the time oops. but didn’t get fired and I could see the visible happiness on my managers face.\n\nWorth.\n\nEdit: grammar ",

        "text": "A group of around a dozen of us went to a curry restaurant in the high street of a town in the UK. There was only one other table occupied on what should have been a busy Saturday night. We ordered our starters and main courses without issue. After a very long time, at least half an hour later, some food started appearing from the kitchen. A couple of starters for some people; some mains for others who hadn't got their starters yet. About half of us had food of some kind at this point. However, the waiter then decided to inform us some dishes were not available that night. The food that did come out was terrible and, in some cases, actually cold.\n\nMeanwhile the other table took the opportunity of a quiet moment in the restaurant to just walk out the door, leaving untouched food on the table, and not paying. That was a step too far in my book but irrelevant to us.\n\nDisgusted by the food situation we offered to pay £10 per person to abandon the meal. This was quite reasonable given the quantity of food that had come out. The manager refused and tried to make us pay for the entire meal, even though we hadn't even received half of it, nor would we ever get some dishes as they were not available. I estimate it should have cost around £15 per head. At this point he decided to lock the door of the restaurant and threatened to call the police. We complied, please do, we replied. The police were there in minutes, walking in through the now unlocked door. They talked to us; then talked to the manager, then came back to us.\n\n\"How about you offer the restaurant £5 per person to end the situation?\" the officer suggested. Everybody agreed, including the manager who pretty much had no choice now, so we paid up half our original offer and left.\n\nThe restaurant closed permanently some time later.\n\nTL;DR: Offered restaurant £10 per person for an incomplete and terrible meal; manager called police; police involvement meant we only paid £5 per head.",

        "text": "TL;DR at bottom\n\nTo get this started, I’m a tailor and salesman at a fairly high end suit shop in London. \n\nThis story involves a type of customer who is regular but still extremely unpleasant. The classic upper class white man - 50s - drives a massive Range Rover - head up his arse. Standard.\n\nWe’ll call this man BOC - balding obnoxious c...\n\nBOC comes into the store barking orders at the staff. He knew his size and had come prepared with a style in mind so quickly had his suit of choice. My first job was easy - I was definitely going to make the sale. The suit was a well known brand and cost around £800.\n\nMy next job was measuring him so that I could easily tailor it for him within a week. I was already put off by his attitude but the fact he hadn’t bothered to shower and his feet stank settled it for me. I was not going to be the most helpful.\n\nNow for the MC! He had a very typical body shape - broad shoulders, narrow waist, matching legs - I told him that the suit was an almost perfect fit and I would just need to adjust a few things. The tailoring will not cost him much.\n\nHe was having none of this, he snarled at me and said he wanted every single part of the suit tailored to him or he would get me fired. My response? “Of course I can do that sir”\n\nI spent the next week constantly addressing BOC’s suit - it took me about an hour to get it to a standard I was happy with but I decided to check every single thing as requested. I spent around 25 hours in total on this suit - a large majority of which was unnecessarily re-stitching areas.\n\nWhen he came back to the store and I began to finalise the sale - I saw his face redden slightly as he noticed the tailoring cost of almost £2000. He was of course furious with me until I directed him towards the agreement he had signed stating that I would tailor everything and he would pay for it.\n\nI felt very smug for the rest of the day knowing I had unnecessarily cost BOC about £1800 more than he should have paid.\n\nTL;DR don’t be lazy it’s not that long",

I usually take pics of our open box TVs in the off chance this happens. Most of the time, things are fine, but this is that \"one\" time. \nI bring the TV up front and IC pulls his car up.\n\nMe: I can't help you load it since it won't fit. TVs should be stood up and not laid down.\nIC: I heard you the first time, just hurry up and I'll load it myself.\nIC loads the TV, flat and since this is a bigger TV, I already know how this will turn out. \n\n4 Hours later\n\n\"Hey inventory, we have a return on a QLED. Customer needs help bringing it in\"\nIC comes up to customer service.\n\nIC: You guys sold me a cracked TV! I want my money back.\n\nCustomer service: That's highly unlikely. We don't sell broken items and we double check to ensure it works. \n\nIC: I don't give a fuck what you did, it was cracked when I opened it up.\n\nCustomer service: Did you have it laying down, we offer free delivery for this exact reason.\n\nIC: Are you saying it's my fault? I drive perfect!\n\nAt this point, I come up.  A manager is there.\n\nMe: I warned you, and you denied the free delivery.\n\nIC: You are blaming the customer? You guys sold me a cracked TV. You guys better back up your products.\n\nAt this point, he's making a scene about how we are scam artists and again how we are going out of business.\n\nI pull out my phone and show the pictures to my manager and the customer. The customer goes from full confidence to realizing he can't return this $2K+ TV because of his own impatience.\n\nManager: I am sorry sir, but we cannot take user damaged items back.\n\nLater the manager buys me a snack because I saved them a huge return.\n\nTLDR: Customer denies the free shipping for TV. I do everything to prevent him from doing so. He cracks it just like I anticipated. Showed him proof of his own fault.\n\nedit: TV was an open box item. The store doesn't sell broken or refurbished items as Open Box , those get sent out. these are like buyers remorse, wife's wrath, or wrong color and size returns. We do checks and inspections to make sure of function and condition. awhile some TVs dont have boxes, this one did. I opened it to take pictures and ensure the accessories were included -per the tag. The customer only saw a display model of the TV, not the actual one sold, but I did.",

        "text": "This is a few years back, though I am still driving my 2005 Santa Fe that's involved with this little dustup.\n\nI had just gotten a new job in a different state, and because it was somewhat of a promotion, the company paid entirely for the move. After seeing all of my stuff packed away safely, the movers started heading to the new state, but as they were driving a different route to avoid icy roads through the Rockies, they were going to take a little longer, so we drove through the night and ended up staying at a hotel. On the way over, I noticed my brakes starting to vibrate just a bit on the descent into the new state, and they were squeaking a tad-new brake pads, maybe new rotors if they can't be machined, no big deal, right?\n\nSo, after we got our stuff unloaded and into the new place, I take the car to a mechanics shop that had good ratings and was even recommended to me by a coworker. But I swear they took a look at my out-of-state license plates and saw dollar signs. When I dropped off the car, I signed the work order for a tire rotation (I know, I'm lazy) and a free inspection, just wanting them to confirm my suspicion on the brakes-I specifically told them to not do ANY work unless I specifically authorized them over the phone and in writing. You can probably guess what happened next...\n\nI called after about an hour to see what they'd found, and sure enough, the boss of the shop said that, unfortunately, I not only needed new pads and rotors, but new calipers as well, totaling $1200, but not to worry, as they'd already started working on it and would have it done in just under a couple hours. Needless to say, I was pissed as all hell, and told him that I had not authorized that nor did I agree that those repairs were likely necessary. I told him I would be over in a minute, to cease all work on the car, and that I would talk to him in person.\n\nOn the way over, I called a different shop (one that had better ratings, and the one I eventually used for every car related need after this for the rest of the time I lived in that state), and explained the situation-she said that it was highly suspect that they wanted to replace the calipers, but that they'd be happy to give me a second opinion of course and that they usually ran around $300 for new pads and rotors.\n\nI ALWAYS get second (and sometimes third) opinions on non-emergency repairs like this, just because of the skewed incentives on the dodgy repair places to trump up what's needed (like the original place was doing). Anyway, I get to the repair shop, and proceed to tell the manager that I was taking my car elsewhere for a second opinion, and that if he was right and the calipers needed to be replaced along with the rest of the brake assembly, I would be happy to have him bid on the work. He responded that he'd be happy to have my car towed to a different shop (for $150), but that he was legally obligated to hold my car as it was an \"unsafe vehicle\" and he would be liable for any damages that ensued if my brakes were to fail should I leave.\n\nI KNEW this was bullshit. We yelled about it for 10 minutes, with him every time refusing to budge, saying that he'd have it towed for $150 or do the repairs, nothing else. I told him he was committing grand theft auto, and that I would call the cops if he didn't put my car back together and let me drive away. He told me to do it-that they would back him 100%, and they might fine me for driving with \"completely destroyed brakes.\"\n\nSo, I did. I called the non-emergency police line and was eventually transferred to a very nice female police officer, and I calmly explained to her my situation. She was super helpful and confirmed, of course, that the mechanic had no legal basis to hold my car against my will, and although she did warn me that I was (of course) liable for any and all problems that might arise if I was indeed driving with bad brakes, it wasn't his problem (she actually laughed at him saying he was \"liable\" if I got into a wreck after I left), and that he was in violation of the law. \n\nSo, I took my cellphone in and had him talk to her, and he proceeded to be a massive asshole to her on the phone, at first not believing that she was, in fact, a real police officer, and then insisting that she didn't know what she was talking about, he'd done this before and knew the law. He still didn't believe she was a real, actual police officer, so she promised that he'd find out soon enough (she told me she said that after he handed the phone back to me).\n\n15 mins later, after I waited outside because I was REALLY close to just losing it talking to this fucking asshole, a squad car rolls up, and asks me where the manager is. They were informed already of the situation, walked up to the guy, and handed him something I assume was either a ticket or a summons or something (they wouldn't tell me what afterward, but they did look satisfied as all hell and were super nice to me), and told him to put my car back together immediately and let me go. \n\nThis had all been over 4+ hours from the time I dropped my car off to the time they drove it out of the bay ready for me to drive away. And after all that, he hands me the bill-$50 for a tire rotation, and $100 for the \"inspection.\" I had a copy of the original, of course, and told him to go fuck himself on the inspection fee, and looking at my car outside, I told him to see for himself that the tires weren't actually rotated-the cops were still there, too, so there wasn't much he could do but let me sign a $0 work order for nothing and walk away! It was glorious.\n\nAnd of course, the other repair shop said it was just the pads that needed to be replaced, and they were able to machine the rotors so that there wasn't a hint of vibration-all told, $200, and a great new mechanic I could trust in a new area to boot (seriously, when I find a mechanic or dentist that I know is honest, I will remain loyal to them until I die or move more than 4 hours away)!\n\nTL:DR Mechanic thinks he can screw over an out-of-state guy in need of repairs and proceeds to essentially steal my car. Tells me to call the cops to get it back, I do, and he gets served a nice cold dish of screw you.\n\nEdit: \"new the law\" to \"knew the law\" I AM SO SORRY PLEASE FORGIVE ME\n",
