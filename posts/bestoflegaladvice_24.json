The moderation team of this subreddit providing him aid and comfort instead of removing his own posts which he had to do voluntarily. This is defamation per-se and negates my need to prove damages.\n\nAfter everyone in the subreddit was mean to me, I filed my defamation lawsuit and served all of the mods, all of the quality contributors, and all the reddit admins. None of them showed up to court, so I won a default judgement, granting me sole ownership of the subreddit. In addition, the judge ordered that u/expiresafteruse become my coffee table, u/demyst become my cabana boy, and u/cypher_blue become my chauffeur. \n\nTo cut down on costs, I was planning to replace the mod team with markov chain AI bots, but it turns out that u/bug-hunter already was one.\n\nEdit: [I forgot to attach this video of the courtroom when the judgement was announced](https://i.imgur.com/TKiAJWX.gifv).",
