I even enjoyed the \"Custom House\" introduction. \n\nI've been thinking since reading: was *The Scarlet Letter* ever intended to be an endorsement of romanticism, or was it a criticism of both extreme puritanism and extreme hedonism, opting instead for a middle ground, presumably to be found in genuine Christian expression?\n\nHarold Bloom, himself a Romanticist and aesthete, seems to see *The Scarlet Letter* as part of the sacred company of Emerson, Whitman, and the rest of the Transcendentalists. In a way, the text seems to confirm his view insofar as Hester is depicted heroically. And Bloom is not alone, as many scholars have suggested that the novel works as a depiction of heroic rebellion and female sexuality against repressive and hypocritical outside forces.\n\nHowever, Leland Ryken, a Christian professor of English at Wheaton College, [argues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np49obyD2FY) that the moral core of the novel is to be found not in Hester Prynne but rather in Arthur Dimmesdale, who represents true Christianity. This argument goes that while Dimmesdale is flawed, it is he who represents the moral core of the story, and it is his genuine Christian viewpoint (as opposed to the extreme Puritanism depicted in the novel) that's given support in the novel.\n\nWhich view is better supported by the text of Hawthorne's novel?",

It seems legitimate on the surface because after all this is a book about hunting sperm whales.  However, a part of me keeps thinking this is all a joke, as double entendres abound and his word choice is often suspect.  If that's the case, I think it's kind of juvenile and makes me highly doubt its status as the greatest American novel ever, as some have claimed it to be, unless those critics are readers are a bunch of high school boys.\n\n2. There are a number of soliloquies in the novel.  They're quite strange, like in the middle of an otherwise smoothly moving narrative, suddenly the ship turns to a stage and we have people waxing poetic.  I can't tell how much of this is meant to be read as a joke.  Is he paying homage to Shakespeare but doing it badly enough, at least to me, that it looks funny?  Or is he actually parodying Shakespeare?  Same with him writing scientific (or pseudoscientific) descriptions that have no place in a novel.  Is that even him writing all that, or is that Ishmael?  Because Ishmael becomes the narrator, disappears, we go into the third person, then he's back, and again, at first glance it makes the novel look like the work of someone who doesn't know what he's doing.  This can work in some experimental novels but not in a novel like this, which seems so intent on at least appearing to be realistic, with hundreds of lines of description of whaling and historical references.\n\nIn summary, I come across some passages that are fantastic and show great insight and complexity of thought, and there are long stretches where I find myself absorbed in the story, entranced by the metaphors and historical references, and start to see why this book is seen as great.  Then come passages and some chapters that make no sense, the language does not correspond to the previous chapters, they cause fragmentation, confusion, etc.  And given all the references to sperm and unusual word choices, I can't tell how much of this novel is supposed to be a joke, how much of it is intentional, and how I'm supposed to feel about it.",

        "text": "I've been tasked in my design course to create a board game which materializes the concept of Gestell to the player through gameplay.\n\nThe game is a single-player strategy board game where you are a community leader who has been entrusted with the role of protecting the well-being of your community throughout the various ages starting from the pre-historic time and ending in the galactic era.\n\nThe game board consists of a rotating map which is composed of various natural elements ranging from trees, oceans, mountains and plains, which are the basic and fundamental resources that the community requires to survive.\n\nThe game comes with 2 different types of cards - the “goal” cards outline the number of dice rolls (turns) the player may take for the particular stage and the number of ‘people’ resources to start with while the “event” cards offer some narrative to the challenge and outline what needs to be done by the player. The event cards vary from one era to another to show that the needs of the community change with the progress of time. For example, specifically for the pre-historic stage, events may be of the type: Your community gets attacked from other tribes/animals, your community gets sick or you have to provide food and clothing for your community. The event cards also show a WIN and LOSE condition, with a reward and penalty respectively depending on the success or failure of the player.\n\nSo for example, if the event card taken says that you are being attacked, you rotate the map to have the arrow labeled as \"A\" to point on \"Attacked\" to view the resources coming from the natural elements differently depending on the event card at hand.\n\nAs regards to the basic rules of the game, they are as follows:\n\n    The game ends when all people in your community have died or maximum number of dice rolls has been reached before the goal has been achieved\n    Each event card has a duration of 5 dice rolls, where the player must return back to the “HQ” space before the end of the 5th dice roll or else it would be considered as a LOSE condition\n    Once an event card is completed, a new event card is taken to complete. This process is repeated until the number of dice rolls stipulated on the “goal” card has been achieved\n    Once all dice rolls have been played for that particular stage, the next era becomes available to play on\n\nI am now required to make the concept of Gestell more evident for players to experience through gameplay. As it is at the moment, I've been told that the concept remains closer to a generic strategy game than it is a tool to reveal a particular world-view.\n\nOn top of the current structure of the game, I would like some feedback on how can I make the game more better and evident during gameplay to reveal to the player that the game world seen as a set of resources to acquire them for survival is just one of the many different points of view of the game world?\n\nTherefore, I need to show that a functional use of resources is a particular way of approaching the world but not the only one because at the moment my game just shows the utility/resource coming from each natural element and nothing else.\n\nIf always possible, could anyone please help me out in suggesting what this extra element may be added in order to make the game more how he would like it as I've thought over and over about it but till now I'm still out of ideas?\n\nThanks",

If I remember correctly, he is desperately poor for most of the book, but he relies on his parents and friends for financial support. I know that he was an American tourist in France, so probably not eligible for legitimate work, but my understanding is that Giovanni did not have a proper work visa either. Is there some historical reason why an Italian would have an easier time finding work than an American? Or was it only David's pride that kept him from looking for work? Or something else? I feel like that was a big part of the context of the book that I was missing. How do you think Baldwin intended for David's joblessness to be interpreted?",

Tough choices are on the horizon.\n\nMy question for you is: how long do you generally spend working in archives? How did you go about preparing and how did you keep your work efficient?

I'm focusing on film at the moment, but I'm drawing on literary theory within my research, so I thought it was worth asking here. \n\n\nI'm trying to find a term that has a solid definition or is recognised as referring to fiction that is not fantastic, not science fiction, not horror, not surrealist etc. Basically genres where the physics of the storyworld aren't a focal point in the narrative. \n\nI've been using the term \"naturalistic\" or \"naturalised\" to refer to this, but there's a few issues -- mostly because I'm straddling literary studies and film studies, if you say \"naturalistic\" or \"realistic\" to a film person, they think of a specific kind of film (think Italian Realism). Plus in a lot of genres (like romantic comedy and thrillers, even things like crime/detective fiction), while the physics of the world aren't fantastic, the social, procedural, behavioural, linguistic blah blah blah aspects of the world wouldn't exactly qualify as naturalistic or realistic. \n\nSo I guess my question is this: when we're talking about non-speculative genres, is there a specific term apart from non-speculative that I can use, that doesn't immediately create a bunch of issues regarding what is and isn't realistic in fiction? Or, to put it another way, what is the opposite of speculative fiction? If anyone has any suggested readings or theorists I can look at, that would be amazing. ",

However, a friend currently doing a PhD (though in another century) told me that Derrida is done to death and my mentioning of Derrida betrays a lack of awareness of the current critical conversation in literary studies -- which is also a death knell for graduate school admissions. \n\nUnfortunately, my undergraduate studies focussed largely on \"traditional\" theory, such as Derrida, Lacan, Freud, Derrida, Adorno, so I am rather clueless about the current state of theory, especially in relation to poetry. Thankfully, the statement is still a draft and I have about a week or so to edit the statement before the deadlines. I've gone to my university library to grab some books on poetry but they seem largely introductions to the subject. In this light, I was wondering if anyone has recommendations for particular books or theorists that I could look at in order to get a sense of the critical landscape in modern poetry? (By modern I mean anything from Modernism to contemporary poetry --  I know that this is a broad and vague category, sorry!) Thanks!",

I want to analyze a Franzen narrative approach (Gary, The Corrections) characterized by a constant awareness and surveillance of the material/chemical aspect of mental health. Ideally I will play around with this technique in the context of formal materialist philosophy and similar literary examples (DFW comes to mind).\n\nOne problem: I am an undergrad and this would be my first attempt at formal academic work. The journal assures a blind selection process but obviously most of the essays are written by profs and grad students.\n\nFor the record I have excelled in the most advanced literary theory course offered by my uni. I have a decent understanding of the theory approach and a good relationship with my reputable prof. However, I am fully aware of the high standards and rigor these journals expect. I was wondering if anyone here has any general tips for writing theory/analysis at a publishable level. I am trying to read more from this journal to get a better sense, but I would greatly appreciate any pointers on style, structure, approach etc.. Also, I would love to hear of any relevant readings on neurology in literature or materialism in general.\n\nThank you!",

I'm interested in any studies on Virginia Woolf's writing and its reflections of epistemological and ontological assumptions, especially the way that these might be influenced by her position as a female author (Bonus points for any essay that also might trace her readings of Proust). The argument that I want to make is that, while similar authors of the period - typically male - are constantly interested in de-stabilizing the epistemological claims of their description and de-centering of the subject himself, Woolf takes a different tack by maintaining the integrity of her objects of description (by, for instance, writing from the position of the inanimate in To the Lighthouse). She also seems much more interested in the parallax qualities of space, whereas Proust, for instance, is far more interested in the way that objects and characters appear across time (not that Woolf isn't interested in that as well). The take away, then, is that female modernist authors tended to have much more interest in re-centering the subject by insisting upon the integrity and independence of the objective world. Any help would be appreciated. I realize that this is a bit narrower than most ALS questions, but I'm taking a chance that there are some big Woolf fans here. ",

        "text": "Hello there, literary fellows!\n\nI recently have begun thinking a lot about the concept of irony, for different reasons. First of all, I encountered it a little bit when reading a text by Paul De Man (the essay \"Semiology and Rhetoric\"), which was sort of intriguing, as it made me realise some stuff about how language works that hadn't hit me in the head before. I don't want to claim I understood everything the essay tried to say, though. Interesting read, in any case.\n\nWhat really claimed my (along with many other young, impressionable people) interest, though, was David Foster Wallace's essay on irony (\"E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction\"). Since reading it, I've been thinking and seeing this dichotomy of sincerity and irony everywhere (which is maddening), but I feel completely incapable of operating independently within it. I just can't wrap my head around such a broad concept as irony - I just don't understand it well enough. \n\nSo here's my question to you: Where the heck do I begin? I've scouted around a bit, and have eyed Kierkegaard and Nietzsche (mostly because I enjoy how they write, to be honest), but it just feels like too specific starting points. What I dream of finding is some sort of book of the genealogy/history of irony that could introduce me more broadly, after which I could perhaps delve deeper into it. \n\nI hope you're able to point me in the right direction - you're smart people after all, I've seen! I've rarely been this obsessed by anything, and am fairly certain I'm going to write my bachelor's thesis on this next autumn. I want to start early. :)",

A few have gone so far to say the brain is a sensory organ - it collects information - but the gut is what makes decisions. I am terming this phenomenon \"embodied mindfulness\" because I have no idea what else it might be called and I like the wordplay. \n\nIt seems to be an entirely different form of combined epistemology and ontology from Western thought. Culture where the cartesian split never happened. Possibly product of oral culture, who knows. \n\nI think its neat. Theres scientific evidence in favor of it. As an eco-nerd, I can see where the seperation of mind and body has led to all sorts of badness which the promotion of this method of knowledge/being might help mend. \n\nBut like... where do I even start? Anyone encountered this in Western writing? I dont even know possible language or terms for search strings.",

        "text": "I'm taking a literature class in school and for an essay I need to talk about the theme of the quest present in two of the novels from my class. I think I've stumbled onto an idea that I want to talk about, but I'm not sure if the idea already has a name. If it does, I could get some help by researching this online, but so far I haven't been able to find anything.\n\nWhat I've found when comparing two of the novels from my class is that both of them have a well defined quest taking place, there's a clear goal. But in the first text, the reader would view the quest as positive, or optimistic. They would be rooting for the protagonist to complete the quest. If other characters in the story try to stop or slow down the protagonist, the reader would feel anxiety from this and hope that the protagonist can overcome the challenges.\n\nThe second text is dystopian and the protagonist plays a key role in helping the antagonists complete a quest. If the quest is completed, it's basically the end of the world as we know it. The reader observes the protagonist become brainwashed and eventually the antagonists, with her help, complete their quest, which involves gaining control over the world. The reader would feel anxiety and hope that the protagonist is eventually stopped.\nIs there a term for this? I would love to read about this phenomenon online if I knew what to look for.\n\nThanks in advance for any input!",

It is a 15 week course, so I would estimate with it being a 4 credit class, that I should allow 2 weeks per novel. However, reading the novels themselves will probably not be sufficient and I will need to read some literary criticism/theory which focuses on the science fiction genre. This is where I am getting stumped, I am not sure where I should even begin to look for such works. Does anyone have any suggestions?\nTL;DR What are some works of literary theory/criticism that specifically deal with science fiction?",
