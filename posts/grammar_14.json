Is \"I am so confused\" independent or dependent? I think it's dependent because I (subject) am (verb) confused (full thought). Therefore, I feel like there should be a comma. Is this correct? One of the examples I got wrong is:\n\n\"The majority of the survivors came from first class (I thought there should be a comma here) because the first-class passengers had the greatest opportunity to get seats on the lifeboats.\"\n\nThe clauses before and after because are independent right? Connecting 2 independent clauses should need a comma followed by a conjunctions is what I thought. Where am I making a mistake.

There are a lot of tests online. I did them for a while, but at some point I'm not sure about the value of going through another 'insert correct word' question. It's not a problem I get when I'm writing, and it's not difficult to find the correct answer in a controlled setting. \n\nI gave myself a goal to write more in English, comment more on Reddit, and make quantity my goal. I would write a comment for something and put it through an online grammar checker before posting. It's online free version for spelling and basic grammar stuff.\n\nI also try to be more mindful when reading on the internet, try to ask myself why this word is used and not another one. That is combined with slowly reading a book in English, examining every sentence, and trying to ask myself questions for every thing I can think of. I can't say I am able to give myself a decent answer for half of them, but this can hopefully come.\n\nHope someone can help",

I had always capitalized scores like this, especially if it is a common acronym (more people know CRPS than the full name). \n\nI've always seen people capitalize models. For example, the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JULES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JULES) is a model that many people use. \n\nScores often have one or more formulas underneath, Models are the same but on a much bigger scale. \n\nMaybe something that's getting me turned around is that many scores are named after people and those parts are capitalized because the person is a proper noun (e.g. Nash-Sutcliffe, Brier score).  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash%E2%80%93Sutcliffe\\_model\\_efficiency\\_coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash%E2%80%93Sutcliffe_model_efficiency_coefficient)) \n\nOr is there a rule that you should capitalize the letters of an acronym (e.g. CRPS) when you first cite it? But don't capitalize if you never define an acronym?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/grammar/comments/109pniy/struggling_to_identify_the_differences_between/",
        "text": "So, I'm a budding English teacher (just got my CELTA three months ago \\[woo me!\\]) and have kind of been thrown into the fire, so to speak. Regarding formal grammatical theories, syntactic theories, 'standardized' terminologies, etc., I have no formal training whatsoever and am completely self-taught. I've read three separate grammar books in full as well as linguistic articles in my spare time for fun (yes, fun!). However, I'm struggling to understand differences in one key respect: the elision of phrases/clauses. Particularly, I'm not able to wrap my head around the differences between (reduced) relative clauses and participle phrases. Beyond that, I can't seem to find anything linking relative clauses to non-finite clauses. I suppose that last discussion is silly because, at least in a full relative clause, there is a tense phrase, but not if its reduced. I digress - I'll explain my issues below.  \n\n\nI've been getting a lot of question by students about what the differences between non-finite clauses, (reduced) relative clauses, and participle phrases are. Traditionally, clauses should have a subject and a predicate, or should at least have a predicate with an inferred subject - this I know... or thought I did. According to some grammars, clauses are just parts of a sentence, which muddies the waters of what a phrase is. I am aware that there are separate levels of sentence structure: word level, phrase level, clause level, etc. However, it would appear that there's almost no difference between a reduced relative clause and a present-participle phrase. They both act as adjectives and both have the same structure despite being on different functional levels. How am I supposed to tell them apart? This same question goes for participle phrases and non-finite clauses whose head is a participial.  \n\n\nOne distinct difference I think exists is that relative clauses come directly after their noun, whereas participle phrases can theoretically be placed anywhere in the matrix as long as their referent is identifiable. Perhaps my attempt to analyze some sentences would help demonstrate my issues:\n\nBesides syntactic formulation, I see no difference between these two sentences. Beyond that, it wouldn't explain why one is a phrase and the other isn't - or would it? \n\n&gt;\"Crushed by the steel-toed boot, the cockroach breathed its last breath.\"  \n\"The cockroach (that was) crushed by the steel-toed boot breathed its last breath.\" \n\nIs \"crushed\" in both adjunctives based off of a verb or an adjective? Secondly, how would we make these complete so that there is an overt subject? With the relative clause, that's easy enough; but what about the participle phrase? Does adding a subject into it turn it into a clause. How would we even go about doing that without changing things around significantly?\n\nAnother example follows, this time using the present-participle:\n\n&gt;\"Seeing the crows feast on the dead, Joseph swiftly turned around and ran.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Joseph, (who is) seeing the crows feast on the dead, swiftly turned around and ran.\"\n\nAs I understand this, the subject of both is \"Joseph\" (inferred in the participial, overt in the relative). One issue I find myself struggling to solve is how we **fill in** such participle phrases? Should I be making two sentences to justify a participle phrase, or should I be attempting to turn the phrase into a fully-fledged clause? Perhaps I could fill in such participle phrases by way of assuming there is a relative clause by saying \"~~(Joseph is the man who is)~~ seeing crows feast on the dead...\". I don't know, and it's grating on me.\n\nSecondly, as defined by **Cambridge Grammar of English**, a non-finite clause can indeed bear similar structure to what I know to be a reduced relative clause and a participial phrase. Let me demonstrate below, with a sentence taking straight out of the book:\n\n&gt;\"Coming round the corner, we spotted the old house.\"\n\nNow, \"coming round the corner\" seems to be modifying \"we\" here. I don't think it's modifying the entire clause. I see quite literally no difference between this clause and a present-participle phrase whatsoever. \n\nOn the topic of non-finite clauses, several grammar books have defined them as being to-infinitives, -ed participles, and -ing participles. Do these require any specific placement in the matrix? Whilst writing this part of my plea for help, some lightbulbs began flickering in my noggin, leading me to some nuggets of understanding. While I can now sort of understand how non-finite clauses are formed, their usage and what forms they take and why still elude me. I would be eternally grateful if anyone took their time to help me with my problems so that I myself can better help my students. If this task is too great (which I expect it is), then I would begrudgingly settle for some comprehensive books or article or YouTube video explaining these concepts specifically, and the differences between them specifically. So far, my searches for explanations of the differences of these exact terms exactly have yielded little.   \n\n\nBooks I have read fully or partially previously to the creation of this post:   \n***Cambridge Dictionary of English - A Comprehensive Guide ( Ronald Carter, Michael McCarthy);***\n\n***Advanced Grammar in Use (Martin Hewings);***\n\n***Essential Grammar in Use \\[3rd Edition\\] (Raymond Murphy);***\n\n***Practical English Grammar (Michael Swan);***\n\n***Oxford Modern English Grammar (Bas Aarts);*** \n\n***Complete English Grammar Rules by Farlex International.***",

        "text": "I'm writing a book that has knights and baronesses and other titled people and I'm having a conundrum. If someone's title is Lady Jane Smith and the narrative refers to \"the lady\" or a character says, \"she's a lady\" do you capitalize \"lady\" to show that it is a title she has and doesn't just mean a woman? If so, does this apply to other titles as well? Should it be \"the Baron\" or \"the baron\"? I was confident it was lower-case, but then a character called someone the more ambiguous \"a lady\" and I started questioning everything.",
