        "text": "Hi, sorry for the stupid title/request. \n\nSo, I'm writing a paper on economics where one school of thought critiques another and shows how its full of logical contradictions. But the school of thought it critiques is used by the first school as a defence of some of it's positions. So when it takes out the second school, it kind of takes out itself, or shows that it's in need of some deep reform. It reminded me of the story in a video game, FFX, where the world is plagued by a monster called Sin, theres the main hero called Tidus who teams up with some people and kills it, but Tidus isn't actually \"real\" like the others, he is part of Sin's dream - so, when they kill sin, they kill Tidus too. Tidus only exists because Sin does.   \n\n\nSo, I felt like it was quite a good analogy, that in helping to take out this school of economic thought (which isn't quite as bad for us as Sin is in the game, but arguably not too far off, thinking of all the economic crises and unnecessary deaths it causes via things like the world bank, IMF, austerity etc), it actually ends up showing how it, itself is logically incoherent (as generally interpreted), if you unravel the effects of the parts where it relies on the school it debunks. \n\nProblem is, I don't really want to cite a videogame, not least an anime-esque one. So, are there any \"respectable\" stories where the same sort of thing happens? (Not that the hero dies while killing the monster, but where by killing the monster they kill themselves because they are dependant upon it in some way).",

        "text": "“The Whole World Knows” (1948) by Eudora Welty is not a story I could digest in one reading. It took four for me to feel like I grasped it - this is the beauty and the frustration that comes along with Welty. While she is not as caustic as some of her Southern contemporaries, her writing cannot be called straightforward. \n\nThis story follows the depressive episode and attempted suicide of the main character, Randall McLain, after his wife has an extramarital affair with his co-worker that becomes public knowledge in their hometown of Sabina, Mississippi. The narrative veers from reality to his murderous fantasies at whiplash speed and it’s not always clear what is real and what is not. While difficult for the reader to parse, it’s a brilliant way of bringing the mind of a depressed man to life - Randall is just as confused as the reader. \n\nWhile it would be easy to think of Randall as the antagonist at first glance (in his fantasies he violently kills his wife and her lover, he finds a young woman who looks like his wife, forces her to get drunk and has perfunctory sex with her), his mother’s statements that are peppered throughout the text let us know his behavior has changed and become increasingly alarming since the affair - leading the reader to the conclusion that what we see of him now is not what he used to be. Perhaps the most difficult read so far in terms of style, but also one that I will not forget. \n\nQuotable: “… but if I saw it, it was not with love, it was a pencil mark on the sky. I did not think of my childhood anymore. Sabina had held in my soul to constriction. It was never to be its little street again”.",

        "text": "We move into the next decade with Nancy Hale’s 1941 story, “Those Are as Brothers”. \n\nA German-Jewish refugee finds a friend in a woman who has escaped an abusive relationship in Connecticut. The title is a line from the 1936 poem, “A Speech to Those Who Say Comrade” by Archibald McLeish: “Those are as brothers/whose bodies have shared fear/or shared harm or shared hurt or indignity”. \n\nDuring a summertime party, Mrs. Mason finds herself unexpectedly understanding Mr. Leob’s broken English explanation of the concept of the oppression and shared trauma that Holocaust victims held. She describes the (what we would now refer to as) PTSD she suffers as a result of her abusive husband as isolating; a neighbor who is courting her is held at a distance because she knows he cannot and will not ever be able to make her feel fully safe. She recognizes in Mr. Loeb a shared experience of being robbed of their dignity and humanity, however, and when Mr. Loeb finds himself in danger, it is Mrs. Mason who finds a way to protect him. \n\nThis is the first mention of WWII in the anthology, and it was written fairly early on in the war. The world faced another four years of the horrors of Nazism before the war concluded, and writing such a damning and truthful depiction of the Third Reich was groundbreaking for its time. Of note, this is the first story to end of a optimistic note so far. \n\nQuotable: “‘The more and more that are oppressed all the time, the more there are who know the same thing together the same thing, who have it together. When it is time and something happens to make it possible, there is something that all of these have together that will make them fight together. And now Frenchmen, too, Belgians too, Flemings. If you have been in a concentration camp, it is more together than that you might be from different countries. I speak very badly’ Mr. Loeb said. ‘No’ Mrs. Mason said. ‘A common cause’”.",

I have gotten some advice from my current professors, but am hoping to get some viewpoints from any of you that work in this field? I would like to know what the current climate is like with the English faculty where you are - I know it is difficult finding a position in Classics at the moment and I’m assuming it might be all of the humanities having that issue. I am honestly not expecting to achieve tenure-track - I don’t see it as realistic where I am, and I realize that not having tenure will mean less pay/less benefits/etc. I live a pretty simple life and always have, so it doesn’t really bother me much. For reference, I am in Canada. \n\nAnyway, I would like to hear some of your experiences if you are open to sharing. I haven’t had much of an opportunity to interact with anyone in my faculty since the beginning of COVID, so it has been difficult. Thank you!",

        "text": "It's not that I didn't know that 1984 and Brave New World or even The Hunger Games are books with political messages, but rather that it wasn't what interested me about the story. \n\nI was (and still am) obsessed with the concept of dystopia. I would read and re-read 1984 and BNW almost every day in high school, comparing and contrasting the dystopian concepts that are built in that book. Like I knew in concept that what was described were allegories or analogues for something in the real world that were meant meant to horrify or warn you, but I was very interested in how the fictional society worked as a whole and how it worked.\n\nFor example, in 1984 when Winston describes what he eats for lunch, I didn't nessecarily see it as a commentary on the real world government rationing and disgust people have with that kind of governmental control, but rather as \"what the Oceanic government feeds their oppressed citizens,\" \n\nAs I've gotten older and been more into writing my own things, I've realized more and more how loose the dystopia is in 1984 because it wasn't written with the intent to be an interesting altnernate history story with stuff like worldbuilding and character development, but rather it was written as a political allegory right after WW2, just like how Animal Farm was written as an allegory for the Soviet Union. It's not even written well.\n\nBrave New World was also written as a political commentary, but to me the society presented in the book is more well written and better crafted as a fictional dystopia, like it's much more easy to read as a scifi story. I'm unsure if that was the intent of the author, though.\n\nThe Hunger Games is the same way as BNW. It's a commentary on the effects of war, but it's also still a YA novel with an interesting dystopia that was crafted to BE a story about a dystopia.\n\nIt's sort of strange to me to come to the realization that no, not everyone reads 1984 and Brave New World like they're solely stories about fictional dystopias. I'm not sure if this makes much sense, but did anyone else have similar realizations about other pieces of fiction?",

        "text": "It seems odd to me that so much literary internet discourse about contemporary literature favors male writers on social media platforms, especially given how women appear to be dominating the current literary landscape: *Annie Ernaux, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Lydia Davis, Rebecca Solnit, Anne Carson, yaa gyasi Elena Ferrante, Eimear McBride, Olga Tokarczuk, Mieko Kawakami . . .*\n\nEven if you don't believe that women are dominating the literary landscape I find it odd that, amongst the bookish corners of the internet, these writers don't seem to occupy the same reverence, or inspire the same number of discussions as, say, Murakami or Knausgaard.\n\nAnd because this is the internet, I want to try and get ahead of some comments I anticipate. My favorite writers are men - Johnson, Pynchon, McCarthy - and I understand that to define a writer by their gender is reductive, but it seems odd to me that discussions, such as on this subreddit and others, appear to skew overwhelmingly male.\n\nThere's also the possible comment that for a large majority of literary history men dominated literature and this subreddit tends to skew towards 20th Century American lit, but even then there's seldom any mention of Gayle Jones, Toni Morrison, Virginia Woolf, Gertrude Stein, etc\n\nAnyways, I only wanted to try and bring this to light and see what the subreddit thinks. I think part of the reason this is on my mind is because I'm on Ferrante's third Neapolitan book and find it a shame that she's seldom mentioned on reddit. \n\nI say this all because it's what I understand to be true, and I welcome any comments that disagree. I only want to see what others here think, and whether this is an issue they agree with or if I've somehow missed the mark.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/10dvas8/what_books_have_a_similar_depth_of_psychological/",
        "text": "I felt that Middlemarch had a *lot* more psychological depth than Anna Karenina (having made it to around book 3 so far and paused there), and the poetic way Tolstoy draws something universal out of small gestures to characterize his characters was more densely present in Eliot's writing as well. Middlemarch made me realize that other books give me the feeling that actors just walked up on a stage and took on a role to play out a story for me - where Middlemarch gave me the feeling that its world was so much larger than the text, and Eliot/Evans was just guiding me through it, at times holding a magnifying glass  to it. Like if you cultured these peoples' skin, you'd find the bacterial cultures that lived on them. I'm noticing it may be that I like books that aren't so plot-driven that they can slow down and really take their time soaking in the details of the picture they're drawing. Whatever that picture might look like. \n\nMiddlemarch is in the neighborhood of historical fiction whereas my #2 favorite thus far, Gormenghast, is a surreal weird fantasy, but it also takes its time slowing down to really paint in every nook and cranny - though in this case more literally, as Gormenghast doesn't go particularly \"deep\" into its characters, but it does spend a lot of time fleshing out the visual pictures of its scenes. Both of them blew me away for this, and I'm finding myself skimming other books and dropping off of them to take a break and try something else because nothing else feels as deep as these two. Gormenghast is the only thing that has ever left vivid, detailed visual memories deep in my mind long after reading, and I might also admit that as a 31/m reader, Evans' descriptions of &gt;!Bulstrode's guilt, and Dorothea and Ladislaw at the end!&lt;are the only things that have yet to bring real tears to my eyes. \n\n( \\~ For a recap of where I've gone since those reads: on the fantasy end, I've worked on Crowley's Little, Big and Wolfe's Book of the New Sun without being pulled all the way in; Little, Big's prose was enough to keep me going for larger stretches at a time and it may be the least disappointed I've been since these books just based on the uniqueness of its prose alone, while after several chapters TBOTNS just doesn't feel as close to \"literature\" as F/SFicionados say yet --on the \"lit\" end I went at Nabokov because I'd call Lolita my #3; Pale Fire went slightly over my head and just didn't invest me enough to make me want to figure out its game, while reading Ada, or Ardor right after Lolita just gave me more child sex themes than I felt like dealing with, and I'm finding myself slightly turned off by the \"family chronicle\" subgenre as it feels to me it lends itself less to adding depth and more to giving the author a convenient way to stitch otherwise unrelated stories together and make a work longer than it necessarily deserves to be - usually more like reading a series of shorter works than one deeply immersive one. Also, the trilingual puns and such were over my head again. Mason &amp; Dixon is another I really enjoyed for its style, which was enough to keep me going for long stretches at a time, though I drifted off three quarters or so in because however entertaining Pynchon's style is, I don't exactly find him to write in a way that delivers long-term payoff when you aren't being sucked right in by the page itself. Getting over halfway into Blood Meridian made me feel that McCarthy is downright tiresome: characters aren't fleshed out besides The Judge who is just your average college kid reading too much Nietzche; I felt even sections with &gt;!dead babies hanging from trees!&lt; were written in a way that was more boring than shocking: I found myself rewriting in my head to make it more engaging by, for example, &gt;!picturing the travelers starving at that point in their journey and hoping it was animals they could still cook for food before getting close enough to realize what it was.!&lt;I **loved** the poetry of The Waves, though it's just short of being in my all-time category, and I have a whole Woolf Collection waiting for me on the shelf now. \\~ )\n\nI don't necessarily need the psychological depth of Middlemarch, and I don't necessarily need the visual depth of Gormenghast, but I do want the same level of depth, you know? I'd hope being open to what *kind* of depth would give me a wider range of options for things that get \"similarly deep!\" What else do you think spends the time necessary to sink deep into the moment in the way that these works do? Proust is an obvious one, which I plan to keep at, and I'm thinking John Williams' Stoner may be the next most likely candidate for what I'm searching for.",

        "text": "Just finished Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier, and I’m stunned at how anti-feminist this book is.\n\n1. Rebecca: the plot twist of the book is that Rebecca wasn’t actually this amazing woman who Maxim loved. Rebecca was a ho who had premarital sex (presumably a lot of it), cheated on Maxim, and tried to seduce every man around her. Maxim kills her because of her infidelity, thinking she’s pregnant with another man’s child, and the murder is considered by the narrator to be 100% justifiable. Then, it’s revealed that Rebecca was actually dying from cancer, which it was implied she got because of sleeping around.\nWas Rebecca a good person? No. Does that mean it was morally permissible for Maxim to murder her? Absolutely not. It’s atrocious that his actions are painted as justifiable. Not to mention the fact that he thinks she’s pregnant at the time!\nThe moral of Rebecca’s story seems to be “women, fuck around and find out.” Disgustingly sexist.\n\n2. The unnamed narrator: The defining characteristics of this woman are her timidity, awkwardness, jealousy of Maxim’s love of Rebecca, and desire to be an appendage of Maxim’s. She has no hobbies or interests other than Maxim. Now, not every female main character has to be a heroine! It was actually kind of refreshing to read a book with a main character who’s shy and awkward. But her character growth happens when she learns that Maxim never loved Rebecca, and that he killed her. She “grows up” and is “no longer a child,” wholly because Maxim loves her. Her character growth is 100% dependent on a man. Pathetic.\n\nWtf, daphne du Maurier?",

        "text": "“The Cracked Looking Glass” by Katherine Anne Porter (1932) is next. The genre of short story is not well defined in terms of length, and this 20 page work certainly walks the line between a short story and a novella. \n\nThe story follows the musings of an Irish ex-pat, Rosaleen, about her marriage and life in rural Connecticut. The story features vignettes of her elderly husband’s thoughts as well, but Rosaleen dominates the story. A major theme throughout is distortion: how Rosaleen’s memories of her youth in Ireland are viewed through the brightest of rose-colored glasses, the messages she believes her dreams are conveying to her (which have all proven false), the namesake broken looking glass, and the evolving perspective she has of her husband and marriage. \n\nHer quiet discontent reminded me of Paula Cole’s (excellent) 1996 hit, “Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?” - a testament to the timelessness of the gloom and disillusion that comes with growing old. \n\nQuotable: “Rosaleen sat silent, without rancor, but there was no denying the old man was getting old, old. He got up as if he gathered his bones in his arms, and carried himself in the house. Somewhere inside of him there must be Dennis, but where? ‘The world is a wilderness’, she informed the crickets and frogs and fireflies”.",

While the Brontë’s are firmly Victorian, writing in the middle of the century. There is no need to decide which is best. \n\nI truly believe that they are constantly compared due to society’s expectation for women to compete against one another.

        "text": "“Babylon Revisited” (F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1931) is the most famous work so far in the anthology. The title was familiar to me, but I had never read it so I have been excited to get to this point in the book. \n\nAll of the stories so far have shared a common trait: the exploration of misery. This is the story of Charlie, a man in Paris visiting his young daughter who is in the custody of his deceased wife’s sister. The story is set directly at the onset of the Great Depression; the once crowded metropolitan bars are empty, the streets of Paris have lost their magic, the halcyon days that led up to the present are distinctly in the past. Charlie has the intention of regaining custody of nine year old Honoria from his embittered sister in law (who has every reason to doubt Charlie), and he nearly makes the dream a reality. The story has a glimmer of hope that is ultimately extinguished when ghosts of his sordid past begin to haunt him. \n\nWhile I struggled to find a quote that resonated with me in the last story (Lardner’s acidic “Haircut”), “Babylon Revisited” is so eminently quotable it’s hard to settle on one. In this way, along with the Jazz Age setting, “Babylon Revisited” is congruent with Fitzgerald’s most well known work: “The Great Gatsby”. \n\nQuotable: “‘I heard you lost a lot in the crash.’ ‘I did’ he added grimly, ‘but I lost everything I wanted in the boom’. ‘Selling short’. ‘Something like that’”.",

        "text": "Recently I've started to become interested in the idea of the passive narrator character in novels. This came from reading Gore Vidal's historical novel about Aaron Burr. The novel is narrated by Charles Schuyler and it's largely about him narrating the story of his friendship with Aaron Burr. In the novel he's basically trying to prove a major presidential candidate is secretly Aaron Burr's bastard son so he can write a book about it and use the money from the book to move to Europe. Despite Charles Schuyler largely having a very passive personality Gore Vidal still manages to make the character interesting. In the novel Charles Schuyler hates American politics and only participates in it because he desperately wants to become a european writer and never return to America. In the novel the reader gets to see Charles Schuyler fall in love with a woman along with seeing him learn more about the world and his place in it. Charles Schuyler almost seems like just a plot device but Gore Vidal stops that from happening. Charles Schuyler does not show himself to be a morally upstanding man but he does show himself to be a fascinating passive narrator.\n\nNick in the Great Gatsby is similar to Charles Schuyler. Gore Vidal's Aaron Burr novel is largely about the passive Charles Schuyler's relationship with the energetic and active Aaron Burr. The Great Gatsby is largely about the passive Nick's relationship with the energetic and active Gatsby. In both novels the passive narrator being so passive is what leads to the passive character being able to be present at all the events that he narrates. For example in the Great Gatsby Nick is passive enough to follow Tom off the train and to his mistress much like Charles Schuyler is passive enough to interact with the crude and obnoxious character named William Legget. Nick is passive enough for Tom to not fear introducing him to the woman he is cheating on his cousin with and Charles is passive enough for William Legget to not fear telling him complicated and secret political information. Nick and Charles being passive cause all the characters to trust them which causes them to be able to properly narrate the story.\n\nNick is a character who is passive due to the fact that he is deeply afraid of seeming rude or judgemental. This is obviously from Nick's father telling him not to judge other people and Nick having 1920s midwest sensibilities. Nick being so passive is what makes him so interesting because his passiveness comes from something. Nick is the ideal passive narrator character as his passiveness makes him interesting and makes the story more interesting. Nick is fastly becoming one of my favorite fictional characters the more I think about him. There are other examples of passive narrator characters in literature such as Charles Ryder in Brideshead Revisited. Nick has Gatsby , Charles Schuyler has Aaron Burr, and Charles Ryder has Sebastian. All 3 passive characters have a close relationship with characters who are the complete opposite of passive and that enhances the story significantly which is why I really like passive narrator characters",

But I also don't want to wait too long to read it, I want to read it while I'm still somewhat young because I feel like I potentially have a lot to gain from the story at a young age that I would miss out when I'm older.\n\nI know that everyone grows at different paces, so I'll ask these questions instead to help me gain more insight that will help me as an individual decide when is a good time for me to pick up the novel.\n\nAt what age did you read lolita? How did you feel about it? At what age do you wish you had read it? Why?\nIs there anything that you wish you had read or known before reading Lolita?\n\nAnswer all or none of these at your leisure, ofc :P",
