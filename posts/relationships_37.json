        "text": "Me (23 boy) and him (28 boy) are together and are very in love. We made a lot of compromise for each other and he told me he wants us to help each other to become more healthy.\n\nHe's big in the techno scene. Sometimes he comes back home at 8 am. I'm okay with it as long as he can rest the next day but in 2 weeks he's going to a club until 7 am and works at 10... I find that irresponsible and idk what to do because I can't tell him what to do but I don't like this behavior. Am I overreacting or should I say something? I know if he does that regularly it's going to be difficult for me to imagine a future with him.\n\n\\---  \\*\\*TL;DR;\\*\\* : Am i overreacting and should stay quiet or I should tell him what I think, and probably won't like the reply?",

        "text": "Long story short, I'm an autistic (yet goofy) individual who happened to be bullied alot in high school. I wasn't liked by the \"cool kids\", I was that autistic nerd that loved playing world of warcraft, magic the gathering, anime, marvel - you get the idea, these things make me super happy. I was the student that formed a friend's club at school, so everyone can have an opportunity to meet others &amp; not feel alone. That's where the bullying came in, I was always picked on by a group a jerk simply because they thought I was weird &amp; made fun of my autism. I was getting beaten up, no one stepped in but this one guy did: the guy that would be my best friend, who we'll call Andrew. \n\nAndrew is 3 years older than me, I just turned 18 &amp; he's 21. He was a senior, I was a freshman. He actually defended me, hopped in and attacked my bully. He didn't leave after that either, he held me and took me to the nurses office. You know what the amazing part was? Andrew didn't leave at all. He stayed with me at the nurses office, made sure I was doing okay. This was when our friendship started and I'm blessed to have met him. He invited me everywhere, wanted to get to know me &amp; took interest in my hobbies. He was the sweetest, kindest and greatest person I've ever met and he still is till this day. I have trouble focusing in class, so he always helped me with my homework &amp; not once did he treat me different due to my autism. I felt I could be myself around him, I felt safe and loved.\n\nSo before he graduated that year, I introduced him to my mom (she was 30 at the time) because I simply couldn't shut up about him to her. She really appreciated everything he had done for me, she welcomed him into our home and was incredibly thankful for being a great friend to me. She did jokingly embarrass me by saying I always talk about Andrew, but he really appreciated that i thought highly of him. After this, we invovled him with our fun activities. We all went to the beach, went to theme parks &amp; comic cons - it was the greatest time of my life. He became a family friend immediately, I'll even say he was my first genuine friend that actually cared about me. \n\nAfte he graduated, he went to a local community College &amp; we spent the entire summer together. Again, our fun actives didn't end. Andrew, my mother &amp; I all spent time together constantly. He was like a brother to me, I wanted to be with him all the time and the fact that he was with me made me feel happy. He also believed in me, said I was going to do beautiful things in life and encouraged me to do well in school. Aside from my mom, he was the second person in my life to treat me with respect. He told me on my birthday how much he loved me and treasured our friendship. We got matching spider-man rings, which is awesome cause he's my favorite superhero.\n\nIn a weird way, he felt like my dad. I really hope that makes sense. He always checked to see if I was doing good, if I needed anything, help with anything, wanted to talk - he was very protective of me, which is something I've never had with another male individual. He felt like a father figure to me, someone I looked up to - even if he was only 3 years older than me.\n\nWell here we are now, 3 years later and still the best of friends. Although, something has now changed. Andrew and my mother (who's now 32) have spoken to me about something pretty big. They both admitted to being in a relationship for quite a while, they began dating a year after Andrew's graduation. They wanted to be honest with me, as they really want to become serious &amp; not keep it to themselves. They want to be public about it, not feel hidden and they wanted me to know about their love for each other. They said they didn't want to hurt me &amp; understood if I was upset.\n\nHow do I feel? I feel happy! My best friend who I absolutely love is dating and making my own mother happy. Why should I be mad? These are 2 people I care about with all my heart, I think it's beautiful they found love with each other and I appreciate that they were honest with me about their relationship. Andrew did pull me to the side, said he understood if things would be weird. He told me he cared about me and doesn't want to hurt me. He told me he understood if I wanted him and my mom to stop seeing each other. I told him no, that they're grown ups &amp; that I'm happy my mom is with someone like him. \n\nEver since this day, they've been happily together. Yes, he does stay in our house a few times a week &amp; I don't mind one bit. If it were for me, I wouldn't mind if he was officially living with us. I think it'll be nice to have him around, I feel very safe &amp; cared for around him.\n\nAm I wrong for supporting Andrew and my mother being together? I had a friend of mine complain how weird it was, said I should be upset. But why should I? I love and think highly of Andrew, I know he cares and would never hurt my mom. Yes a few friends have said some dumb things, they believe it's just weird &amp; that I'm wrong for allowing it. I simply want to ask you all, am I wrong for being okay with this? I don't see anything wrong with their relationship, maybe it's just me.\n\nI'll appreciate your honest thoughts on this. The comments my friends have made definitely are sticking in my mind, I should totally ignore them but unfortunately I can't. Their comments keep replaying in my mind, which is bugging me so much. I wish they can see this whole thing like how I see it, but they don't which I do understand completely.\n\nTl;DR: my mother &amp; best friend are officially together and I'm happy. My friend's think I'm wrong for allowing it, but I personally feel it's okay. I'm happy that my mom and best friend are together.",

I recently started to notice that he always brings up the topic of money in almost all of our conversations, regardless of what we’re talking about. He is envious of other people and how much money they make. Making more money seems to be the only thing on his mind.\n\nI love that he is ambitious and wants to improve his life, but he is just always extremely negative. We also have different outlooks on life. I don’t really care about being rich. I just want to make enough money to live comfortably and be happy. \n\nHe also makes me feel bad about my current financial situation and job (although i think its unintentional). I think he thinks that my job is meaningless and that i should be striving for more. But i suffer from depression and anxiety, so its difficult for me to work a lot of jobs. \n\nHow can i talk to him about this?\n\nTLDR: boyfriend constantly complains about money.",

        "text": "\nTo make it simple, because I know no one will read this otherwise, I’ve known the person in question since elementary school and we’re now both 19 years old. Throughout our lives we’ve been good friends and spent a lot of time together. However, it wasn’t until high school where our friendship was really put to the test. Because I was in an abusive family at the time I became incredibly depressed/withdrawn and stop seeing my circle of friends. Although none of my other “friends” reached out to me, the person in question did and I am forever grateful for that. My problem, however, with this person is a couple of things. First off even when I was struggling, I’d still hang out with my “friends” and our respective girl group. I had a problem with alcholol and often started fights, become openly depressed/suicidal, and was in genera difficult to be around. I’m a handsome guy but I could tell I was scaring the girls around me. The only reason I mention these things is because every time I’d hang out with my friends and the person in question I’d get pressure to drink despite them clearly being aware of the negative consequences of doing so. I felt like sort of a source of entertainment for the person in question, and although he helped me through that difficult time in my life, I can’t help but think may be he contributed to it as well. I know I was an adult during that time but I wish the person in question told me to put the bottle down and stop behaving like a maniac. My theory is maybe my “friends” and the person in question didn’t want to interrupt me when I was making a mistake per se. Flash forward to today, my life is going a lot better and now my friend is interested in starting a business together. I’m kind of stuck though because I think, although he’s not mean per se, he seems so agreeable that I don’t really know if he believes what he is saying or is just trying to cater to me. What do you guys think? I’d really like to know. Also this may be a trivial detail but he also still hangs out with my old “fake” friends.\n\n\nTLDR: Friend pressured me too drink on occasion even when I clearly had a problem but was also there for me in times of distress. Wants to start business together but I’m afraid his lack of assertiveness may be a problem in the future.",

        "text": "Long story short, I had kids when I was young, and have always been in long term relationships since high school. I have no idea what its like to really be on my own. I broke up with my last ex of 5 years at the end of last summer.\n\n I went on a bit of a tinder tyrade so to speak, which Im not super proud of but it led me to meet a one in a million type who I fell for from day one. The first night I met him, he cooked us dinner over drinks and we talked for hours, had the best sex ever (he's the only one to ever make me orgasm with another person), and did it all over again over coffee and breakfast the next morning. We had so many things in common, from hobbies, food, to life goals and family backgrounds. He was sweet, funny, caring and so good looking. He gave the sweetest kisses where he'd run his hands through my hair that just made me melt. He gave the type of hugs that made you just want to fall into them because you knew he'd hold you up through anything. He was smart, worked out everyday and was in really great shape, really just everything you could ask for.  \n\n\nWe spent the next few weeks flirting and texting and within a few dates I asked him to be my boyfriend to which he agreed. We dated for about 2 months, though we lived about an hour apart and because of my kids we only got to hang out about once a week through it. One night while we were together I told him I loved him, and he said it back. Two days later I realized how fast we were going, and it basically gave me an anxiety attack realizing I never meant to even get into another relationship and that there were still things I wanted to do alone - save money, take care of my kids, figure out my career, travel, and honestly, experience more people  before I settled down again.  \n\n\nI told him I think we should take some time apart, and I could tell it really hurt him. But the next day he said we could take a week to think on it and then meet to talk about going slower or just ending things. I wracked my brain all week thinking about how to make it work, but went to meet with him that weekend assuming it'd be our last. But then I got there, saw him and hugged him and realized how much I loved him and I just melted into his hugs and kisses. He just killed me. We agreed to try again but go slower.  \n\n\nThings were good for that week, we texted a flirted and had a date planned for the next weekend. Then one night at work he texted me something super cute and reminded me that I cant go slow with him because I liked him way too much and I couldnt do it. On top of it, through really bad luck and timing, and old fling texted me that same night asking to get a drink.. and we ended up sleeping together. Bf knew something was up and texted me the next morning asking how my date was. I blew up at him, told him I wasnt ready for this, we arent in a real relationship, and a whole bunch of other insults and blocked his number..  \n\n\nI felt bad later that night and unblocked him. He was hurt at first so we got into another fight, but then I broke down into tears realizing how much I loved him and that I wanted so badly to make it work with him; but it was too late. I told him about sleeping with the other guy and I could feel his heart break. All he ever was was good to me and I hurt him so badly. We spent hours into the night texting about how we feel but that things will never be the same and work out now. I told him I realized as soon as I was done with other guy that we really could have made it work, and that I wish I could take it back so that we could. He said it was the one thing he could never forgive and said we shouldnt ever talk again after that night. We told each other we love each other and will miss each other like crazy, then blocked each other's numbers.  \n\n\nI dont know whats wrong with me. This person loved me more than anything, was never anything but the perfect boyfriend and I hurt him so badly. Ive never cheated on anyone in my life, and I did it to this person who wouldve done anything for me, and it scares me about myself. I feel damaged and worthless that i'd rather have no-strings attached random sex with people than be with the person who did it the best and made me feel like no one else ever has. I feel so bad and miss him a lot. He loved me with everything and I crushed him. I'd do anything to take it back, but I know we'll never see each other again. I just want someone to talk to.  \n\n\nTl;dr: met the perfect guy and broke his hear to get with other people and regret it more than anything and hate myself for it",

        "text": "I'm (25M) going to a concert tonight with my ex gf (22F) because we got the tickets when we were still together. We've been together for about 3 years, the last year was very on and off though. We've broken up 3 months ago and this actually seems like the for real breakup after all that on and off. I asked if she still wanted to go to the concert with me because we hadn't seen eachother for a while, otherwise I'd look for someone else who wants to go with me or sell the ticket and go on my own. She said she'd still like to go.\n\nConcert is tonight, and I hadn't rlly thought about it before but now that it's so close I'm getting nervous and idk why. Honestly, I still like her, as I kinda do with all my exes, but our personalities aren't very compatible for a long term relationship. That's why we broke up in the first place despite also having traits and desires that seem so rare to find in other people in the dating pool.\n\nUsually when we were on the off part of our relationship and saw eachother again it would result in sex. Idk how I'm gonna feel and wether I want to or not if it happens tonight as well. My instincts also tell me she's seeing somebody else, which doesn't really bother me but if she does I don't wanna do anything romantic/sexual, because that's what's most healthy for her new relationship.\n\nJust feeling weird and nervous. I'll probably have a very strong desire to kiss or touch her and it's gonna be a tough fight not to act on it. Any tips on killing the nerves or on how to communicate wether it's okay to be intimate or not?\n\ntl;dr going to concert with ex gf (22F) tonight and I still like her, but we're not compatible for long term relationship. I do wish to be intimate and she'll probably also desire it if she's not seeing anybody else though. What's the best way to safely bring it up?",

        "text": "I know the title sounds drastic but I'm gonna have to give some context for this to make sense. At the moment, I don't feel like this situation is that deep tbh, but I'm trying to ask for opinions on this.\n\nSo I have a college friend group consisting of around 5-6 guys including myself. They're the ones I met in my freshman year right before Covid strikes and everything went lockdown. So during our first couple of months when everything was still physical in early 2020, our situations (living the dorm life) are the same. But fast forward after almost 2 years of lockdown, a lot has changed.\n\nWe were still great friends during online classes and have group projects together since we all take the same course, but the difference is, especially for me, starting from 2022-now,  I work and study at the same time. Also I have my license, a car and I live in a house. Another guy in the group, lets call him A, is the other one who almost has the same situation except he does not have a job. Others go back to the dorm life again similar to how it was before.\n\nNow for the group chat, we created a discord group to hang out and a group chat to talk to each other/send memes etc² back in 2020 during our freshmen year. Over the course of the online sessions as well, we used the same group chat. But after the lockdown ended, those who live on campus created a separate group chat called \"on campus\" presumably for them to chat everything involving those who stay there (since I don't). But A who does not stay on campus was also in this group chat. Let's just say, it's the exact copy of our group chat, just without me.\n\nNow I can understand why A is in the group chat though, since he is always bored staying alone, he likes to hangout (sometimes even stay the night) in their dorm rooms on campus. So logically thinking that might be the reason I'm the only one not in that. But of course I do feel a little bit left out. Since the new group was created, the group chat we used to talk on is more quiet. Unless I say something and they reply, or it's something that has to do with me, then they don't really chat here anymore.\n\nWhat bothers me is, they know that I know about that group chat. I don't really count this as the 'they got caught' moment, but I found out about the group pretty \"openly\". It was not like they were being secretive about it. Just one day one of the guys said hey look at what (insert name) said, and he showed me the group chat. He acknowledged that I'm not in it so he had to show whatever the news/joke was to me. So it genuinely made me confused as do they really just have another group chat just to not bother me?\n\nNow moving to the 'being used' part, this might be a stretch. But nonetheless I'll tell you guys why I feel that way. So we studied in quite a big campus, getting from the dorms to class takes a long time and energy. Usually, A will take them/be the driver for the group taking them from one place to another without needing to walk or take the campus shuttle. I'm the other guy with the car I guess. So some other time, maybe like 2 times in a week, I am the guy that gives the group a ride to class and cruise around as well. But of course, since I am more busy than the others, I usually just head straight out of the campus after class. I know this is nothing (hence why I think it's stretch), but I feel like it becomes sort of like a chore cause I would need to bring them around in my car and be early to catch them in the morning.\n\nLast but not least, I'm gonna explain the 'hanging out' situation of the group. I tend to not join a lot of them since I'm busy, but now a lot of their plans to hang out possibly at the cinema/to go out into town are all already planned without me in the other group chat. Of course A will be the one taking them everywhere. The times I am available though, they sometimes might ask each other randomly in the open like \"So what time is it tomorrow?\" And I had to ask about what's going on tomorrow, and then they would invite me on the spot if I wanna go. Unless it's something I invite them to, it's almost certain I'm not invited. But I believe that could be because of me always saying I'm busy to go out with them before.\n\nTo conclude, they are friends who I actually need to get through college. They aren't the ones who do stupid shit, we study a lot together and most of the time I am the type to need company especially for the studies. They focused on their study rather than others like partying and stuff so I personally fit in well with them. Are they genuinely friends with me or is there something else going on behind me? \n\nI have also thought before, could it be that they see me as the friend who is only there for the classes/studies, but not outside of it? \n\ntl;dr!\n\nCollege group friends have a separate group chat excluding me (with reasons) and I'm usually not invited to hang outs. I fit in well with them though.",

About 6 months ago she moved out of her parents house in our hometown to Tampa because she wanted to be in warmer weather, life started getting rough for her and she likes the beach. Before she left we talked about doing a LDR. Deep down inside I didn’t want that and would much rather went with her but I agreed to long distance. We see each other about every 1-2 months now and it’s getting harder because I want to spend more time with her. I brought it up that I wanted to move in with her (I’ll pay majority of the bills since I make more). She replied saying that she’s traditional and not into shacking up and that for us to move together she said we’d have to married or engaged first and we’d have to buy a house together. I love her a lot and would absolutely marry her. But the thing is she also said she doesn’t know how she feels about Tampa just yet and she doesn’t know if that’s where she wants to stay. So this basically prolongs us “closing the gap” in our relationship. Idk what to do, we talk about marriage and having kids together. I want to move out of my home town as well and I was thinking about Miami. \n\n\nShould I propose to her and talk about moving into her place? Should I just end it?\nMove to Miami and be a lil closer to her? Give her more time to get adjusted? Idk\n\nI need advice. This stresses me out and it spills over into the relationship because idk what to do \n\nTL;DR gf of 3.5 years moved away to Tampa to get a better quality of life. I offered to go with her but she said we’d have to be married before we move in together. Should I propose or just end it. Long distance isn’t fulfilling to me anymore",

        "text": "So I've been dating my girlfriend for two months and things have been going great, we are most certainly in love and see in each as often as we can. However there has been one thing niggling at my side, early on the relationship she admitted that she had slept with her best friend K after getting dumped by her boyfriend whilst they were really drunk. She said that she started falling for her last year mutually and that they had sex but then decided that they didn't want to romantically involved.\n\nThis is all fine; but understandably a concern for a partner. However she stills sees K alot; as they are still amazing friends, I even get on with K very well. Then the concerning part appears; often she invites K to our evenings and although my girlfriend always sits next to me/lies with me; she sometimes dances close with and joke/playfully kisses K with me there; to top this off they always get drunk together and do a bit of blow. Not ideal obviously but who am I to deprive her of her best friend; the weird thing is that before she had told me about what they had done; I had sort of suspected it(intuition?!).\n\nThe positive side is that my girlfriend is encouraging K to date again, yet sometimes she says concerning things about K like the fact that they'll never be apart and want to live together in the future; I understand it's early days for us but I'm optimistic and like to think that she could live with me, perhaps she's a bit younger mentally and seeks more of the party life as K is going to university but this then contradicts as she states that she sees a future with me.\n\nIf anything more concerning does happen; ie they spend lots more time together doing blow or breach the line in my presence, I am sort of confused how to know the approach and I certainly wouldn't like to throw away what we have over harmless flirting, I am also quite certain that she wouldn't cheat. Perhaps this is just insecurity on my part; me and K seem to get on and she has approved me; bloody hell isn't life complicated!\n\ntldr: My girlfriend slept with her best friend(20F) as a first time sexual experience, I am concerned and wondering the best way to approach this.",

        "text": "Me (40m) and my girlfriend (47f) have been through some pretty rocky times in the few years of our relationship. We started out about 5 months after she first told her ex husband that she wanted a divorce. She never considered it an affair, and she always stated she would divorce him whether or not she was with me - and even if we didn't work out. He did consider it an affair, because while she had asked for a divorce, it hadn't been finalised.\n\nIn the process of her divorce, she and her ex husband sold the house, split custody of the children and she got a relatively poor settlement, and not enough money to re-invest. She would lose money on this settlement every month.\n\nShe moved in to my house, about 1 year after I split with my own ex wife, who I have an expensive settlement with and I have continued to struggle until now.\n\nFor the past 3 years, we've been living together with a patchwork family, and family life is amazing. However, she hasn't been working, she's seen her bank balance dwindle, even though the only thing she's ever contributed towards is the groceries. She now has half of her money remaining, and is starting to panic.\n\nI wish I was in a position to help, but I've been dealing with my own divorce expenses and baggage, so all I've been able to offer her is things in future (as well as paying for everything and dinners out etc). Now, I'm finally back on my feet again financially and ready to coinvest with her. However, in the last months she has started a job, and the way she has seen it is almost like a finger flip in my direction. Now I don't need you, kind of thing. Building her escape. She denies this, but she admits she's fed up of our relationship, has lost faith in me, accused me of BS'ing at the start of the relationship (I told her one day I would like to invest but that I was nowhere near able to yet). She sees it as me dangling a carrot. That infuriates her.\n\nShe resents me for everything that happened as a result of the divorce, losing her security, losing kids half the time, and accuses me of financially 'controlling' her simply because I offered her to live rent free in my house. She does not accept any responsibility personally for any of the above.\n\nShe has unbelievable anger and is on the verge of separating (I can tell), just as her faith in me was going to be rewarded and I was going to start giving back.\n\nIs there any way I can ever help her to get past this intense anger and resentment? She says she doesn't want to split but she also says she can't imagine a future or a way for us to combine, because she claims she is 'scarred' by what's happened.\n\nTL/DR Girlfriend is dealing with massive resentment of me due to the consequences of her divorce, and I am wondering if there's any way to deal with this and move on.",

The person who told me I was his soulmate. All because of my own stupid issues and actions which I am now in therapy for. I let my own emotions get the better of me and split up with my boyfriend, it’s clear I wasn’t thinking straight as I got sectioned the day later. I’m so embarrassed about it all.\n\nImmediately after the breakup I stupidly asked him if we could get back together to which he told me to focus on getting myself better and that he can’t be in a relationship right now, he’s not in the right headspace and I need to work on my mental health which I am currently doing. I now realise the flaws in our relationship that could be fixed if we tried. It would take a huge amount of work from me but I am committed to it. \n\nIt’s been a week now and I keep getting these urges to message him as I genuinely care about his health and how he is keeping. We still have each other on our socials and our numbers unblocked. I keep fighting the urge to message him as I know he needs time to be by himself and to heal but deep down I genuinely still feel like there’s a slight bit of hope and that if anyone is to fix things it should be me as I’m the one who ruined it all. I feel like as time goes on he’s waiting for me to get his forgiveness and that if I leave it too long there will be no hope.\n\nHe still has all our pictures on social media, his relationship status is ‘in a relationship with’ then my name. He also hasn’t returned my stuff. All these trivial things has my mind going into overdrive wondering if there is still a chance for us, he told me I’m not a bad person I just need to get myself better because I haven’t been thinking clearly for a while and taking people for granted. Now I’m starting to see things for what they are.\n\nI really want to reach out to him, I don’t know what to say though. He messaged me saying he was there if I wanted to talk to him so he hasn’t completely shut me out, although I know he’s been hurting - he told me he was angry and upset. I’ve tried to let everything settle for a few days but the urge is so strong I don’t know why? \n\nTL:DR Am I best to just leave things as they are and hope that he contacts me despite me being completely at fault? Or should I attempt to reach out to him. I don’t want him thinking I’m heartless and don’t care about him. He previously said after the breakup he was waiting on me texting.",

        "text": "My son is 15 and he is has been into snakes for a couple of years now. He got his first ball python at 10 and now he is 15 and he has several snakes. His room is just full of tanks. The freezer in the garage is full of frozen rodents. He buys them with his allowance, and more recently his casual job. My wife doesn’t like it so she just doesn’t open the freezer in the garage or go into his room. When he was younger I used to help him with thawing the rodents and cleaning the tanks, but as the years went on and he seemed like he was on top of it all I kind of just let him do his thing. I haven’t checked on his snakes in a while. To my knowledge, he hasn’t killed any of his snakes yet. Sometimes I take him to the pet store and he buys little fancy hides for his snakes or a few bags of wood chips, but we live pretty close so usually he bikes himself there. He loves his snakes, they all have names. I see him walking around the house with a corn snake around his neck sometimes. I thought he was really responsible.\n\nHe’s seemed a bit stressed out and not like himself lately, so I’ve been telling him he can tell me anything he needs to and we don’t need to tell his mom. Guy stuff. I thought there was a girl at school or something, but eventually I poked my head into his room and immediately noticed one of his tanks had the biggest snake I’ve ever seen. I used to have a snake before I got married so I thought I would be able to adequately supervise his new hobby but somehow my son got his hands on a huge snake. I don’t know how big it is, but it’s two or three times the size of all the other snakes he has. It looks way too big for the tank it’s in. I’ve never seen such a huge snake before.\n\nThe poor thing is jammed in a 40 galleon tank. I only got him 40 galleon tanks because I THOUGHT he only had balls and corns. I asked him where he got the snake. He didn’t want to tell me. I told him that he couldn’t keep the snake, it was just too huge. To say he is heartbroken is an understatement. I don’t even know how to describe how big this fucking snake is. My wife would absolutely lose her shit if she knew about this monster snake we have under our roof. Not gonna lie, I about blew a gasket. I told him that it was really cruel to keep such a large snake in such a small tank. It can’t even slither around, there’s just no room. I think my son knows what he’s doing is wrong, but he doesn’t want to give up the snake.\n\nMy son is usually such a good young man but he wouldn’t tell me anything about this gigantic snake. I did some googling but I have no idea if it’s a burm or a retic or what. Some kind of massive python. My son is a bit on the smaller side, I have no idea how he’s been dealing with such a massive snake on his own or how he’s been feeding it. I know how dangerous big snakes can be for one person. I am absolutely kicking myself knowing what could have happened to him in his own bedroom without my knowledge. I immediately started looking for somewhere to take the snake in and give it the proper care it needs. I have been in touch with a local zoo and a local reptile expert, we are working on it together, so it’s just a matter of days till the big snake finds a home that can care for it properly. It cannot stay where it is, and it won’t.\n\nThe advice I’m looking for is how to navigate this with my son. I don’t know how to make him understand why he can’t keep the snake. I’m also worried he will never forgive me for taking his pet away. He can keep all his other snakes, just not the one that is probably heavier than he is. I need to know what kind of snake it is and where the fuck he got it. I’m also debating telling my wife or not. She is also an animal lover and will back me up about the snake not belonging in such a small tank, but I know she’s going to lose her mind. She’s terrified of snakes and will probably get herself a hotel room till we can rehome the snake. She will be mad at me too, so right now I am of the mind what she doesn’t know won’t hurt her.\n\nTL;DR discovered my son has a GIANT python hidden away in his room. He can’t give the snake the care it needs, so I am going to rehome it. How do I navigate the fallout with my son and wife?",

The problem is, I can tell by her personality and the way she acts that she's an easy girl and has probably hooked up or at least fooled around with many other guys before me. Because of this, I really don't want to pursue anything serious with her. It's not that I'm scared she'd cheat on me, but I just don't want to call a girl with that kind of sexual past my girlfriend.\n\nI guess what I would like to know here is, what would YOU do? Let's say you were looking for a relationship with someone, and then you met a girl like this and were really into her, but the more time you spend with her, the more you can tell she's the type of girl who fools around with a lot of guys, and it also doesn't take much time for her to get physical with said guy. Would this alone make you not want to get into a relationship with her?\n\ntl;dr: Met this great girl but she comes across as easy. Don't know if I should pursue.",

        "text": "\nI (27f) ended my 5 year relationship with (28m) yesterday and I’ve been down this road before but never fully followed through. I tried doing this last year November, got my stuff packed and moved into this new place and then bailed last minute because of how painful the feeling of just being alone was. I mentally didn’t think I could do it so I ended up begging for him back and we decided to try and make it work again. Mind you, this is all my doing. He and I have both talked about this plenty of times before how we are just unhappy together and that we aren’t progressing and there are a lot of other factors in our relationship as to why it’s a bit unstable but he would never be the one to call it quits. Even though he’s always the one that usually brings up breaking up. Well, I finally made the executive decision again for the second time now but this time I’m following through with it. We are just not happy together. We don’t share the same interests anymore, we aren’t compatible and we just aren’t in love. I understand long relationships take work and sometimes they don’t feel like you’re in love all the time but we’ve had way too much damage in the past for me personally, I think I’ve mentally checked out a while ago and am now just staying because of comfort and familiarity. Well, today is the day I’m supposed to move onto my new place. It’s a condo and I would be with a RoomAte but I already signed my lease and put my deposit as well as my rent money so realistically there really is no going back. I did that on purpose so I wouldn’t back out of it. It’s just been so hard tho. He cries whenever he sees me and I’m not sure why he’s acting like I’m the only one to blame but I understand he’s hurt. But I am hurt too. It hurts me that we have to go leg go of something we’ve both invested 5 years into but it’s only causing us pain and I’m not happy. \nI guess my question or what I’m seeking is.. does this get better? This feeling of emptiness and loneliness and just feeling so scared and sad you’ll never see them again. How will this get better? I think I got so dependent on him and I’ve just fallen into this feeling of comfort and whenever he is that’s where ‘home’ is but that’s not a good enough reason for me to stay in something I know will only continue making me miserable. I’m going to miss him but I think temporary pain is better than staying in something that will forever make me sad. \n\nTL;DR: I’m ending my 5 year relationship for the second time but following through this time and that feeling of loneliness is creeping up on me again. He was my home and my comfort and familiarity but those aren’t reasons to stay in something you’re in happy in….",

        "text": "I broke up with my Girlfriend about two months ago. The main reason was that I thought wasn't interested romantically in her anymore. We never really fought, had quite a good relationship where we learned tremendously from each other, while also both being really compatible on multiple levels: Interests, Life Goals, Sex life etc.   \nThis came out of a multiple-months-process of me thinking about it, weighing out the pros and cons and discussing it with friends. However, this process was never quite conclusive and I wasn't 100% sure that I should break up with her but in the end I did it anyways because of multiple reasons:\n\n* I didn't want to repeat the mistake of my previous relationship where we stayed together for at least a year longer than we should have, because none of us was ready to be alone, even though we didn't \"really\" love each other anymore.\n* I felt like I didn't \"love\" her anymore, however I wasn't 100% sure here, as I still deeply cared about her and liked to make her happy.\n* My friends, after talking with them more or less leaned into the direction of \"break up with her\", problem is that they only ever heard me talk about it when I was doubting / ranting or even while drinking so I can't know if they had a really \"unbiased\" view. After the breakup most of them said \"as long as you think it's the right decision\" since they all really liked her.\n* I told myself \"the sooner you break it off, the less hurtful it will be for her in the long run. Also it's not fair for her to be in a relationship where she doesn't get the love she deserves\"\n* I broke up and didn't just \"take a break\" because I felt like that's unfair and usually leads to a breakup anyways.\n\nI didn't want to talk to her about all of this before breaking up with her, as I felt like it would only prolong the hurt and I thought she wouldn't really have been able to do something against \"my romantic interest in you is fading.\"\n\nThe break up itself was really bad. I sat her down and told her that I lost the interest in a romantic relationship with her and that I wouldn't find it fair for her to pursue a relationship where she won't get as much back. She cried a lot and we ended it on \"good\" terms, meaning I broke her heart but we agreed to talk as soon as possible and would try to stay friends after a period of \"no contact\" (as long as needed from both sides) so we both could get over it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few weeks were kind of ok, I was really sad but kind of happy that I finally \"did\" it. I wasn't even 100% sure it was the right thing, but I figured I'd need some more time and see that it was the right decision. I spent a lot of time with friends, trying to become more healthy (workout / healthy habits and eating) and focussed on work, not even trying to date anyone or meet new people.\n\nAfter the first month was over, I texted her once, saying the if she ever wants to talk (like we initially said during the break-up itself) I'd be there but that I don't want to push her and that I'd understand if she needs more time. She told me that she needed more time and we haven't had contact since.   \nA week later the doubts started getting more and more serious.\n\nNow, two months later I am heavily regretting the decision and thinking that I shouldn't have done it in the first place. Still haven't reached out to her and so on as I don't want to do anything impulsive. Thinking back I feel like I convinced myself that I wasn't in love with her anymore because I just compared the honeymoon phase to the \"normalcy\" phase and then convinced myself to break up as early as possible to not repeat previous mistakes. But we never really had any problems, matched perfectly and at this point I can see myself spending many more years with her. Then again, the decision to break up with her was made after already multiple months of pondering, making lists and weighing pros and cons. It could very well be a normal phase of post-breakup blues.\n\nTo try to see it more rationally, I have again made pro / con lists and since two weeks I've also been tracking a daily \"do I want her back\" list where I answer that question each day after reading, editing and re-reading the pro / con list. So far it has been a resounding \"YES\".\n\nCurrently I'm thinking of giving it at least another month while keeping up the whole journaling / list stuff, to not do anything impulsive or even hurt her healing process while doing so. Should I wait a bit longer and see how I feel? Then again there is of course this nagging feeling that she'll completely move on if I wait to long, which I know is a complete asshole thing to say and I hate myself for it but it nevertheless is in the back of my mind.\n\nShould I try to win her back? If yes, how would I approach it best so as to regain her trust and not  hurt and confuse her?  \n\nShould I keep with my plan of waiting? Any other similar experiences from the community here?  \n\n\nTL;DR  \nBroke up with my girlfriend of two years because of fading interest / romantic connection from my side, but not being 100% sure about it. After two months it feels like I really did the wrong thing and my heart is screaming to try to get her back instead of keeping no contact as planned.",

We hit it off amazingly, and kept on chatting daily. Some people say they have a lot in common, but with me and her its as if we were almost exactly the same people in terms of personality. And I started catching feelings because she is just so nice, even though we were just friends. In turn, there was also a sense of guilt building up within me because of it, because my boyfriend is also a very nice person, and I know he loves me a lot. \nAnd so, because I believe that such things should never be hidden from partners, I told him about what's been happening and my inner turmoil, and ofcourse, he was understanding, but hurt aswell. I do still care a lot about him and hate that I hurt him. He gave me until tomorrow morning to make up my mind however on wether I wanna be with him or not, or else he will just hit me up to return all the gifts I ever gave him, and I honestly don't know what to do. Like, I don't wanna lose him, but at the same time, our relationship has been kinda doomed from the start because this year I am gonna be going to college, meaning I will move to my country's capital, which is not too close either way, and so will the girl I met.\nI just need some advice because I can't really do this alone...\n\nTl:dr - I have until tomorrow morning to choose between my boyfriend and a girl who I feel is my soulmate",

Also made some hints that he wanted to have sex with me bc he desired me. We ended up having sex 4 weeks after we started talking. He also told me he was a jealous type, and i was okay with that bc i am the same as well so I could understand. For example, one time he said if my gf would go to a club i wouldnt let her go or i would follow her with my car. \n\nIts been 3 months now and I feel like he has changed. Yesterday i told him i wanna visit a museum with a male friend from university. And wanted my bf to come with me too. I expected him to say yes etc. But instead he said “you go, i wont come”. I was surprised that he was reckless. Later then i told him i was disappointed at his reaction. If it was me i wouldnt let him go with his female friend. Then he said “okay im not letting u either then, dont go”. \n\nOn Valentines Day he said he is too busy with work(i know its not a lie, we work in the same office) but at least i expected a rose etc. But i got nothing. \n\nHe used to offer me coffee dates after work. No more coffee dates after work either even when he is not working extra time. \n\nI told him i wanna go to abroad with my friend and he said only “have a good time”. \n\nOne day i texted him “morning love❤️” message and no response from him. He texted me in the evening. The day after i told him i was broken for not getting a morning back. And he told me “u know its bc of work, im busy. I apologize”. But that day i saw him going to lunch with his friends. Its obvious that he didn’t care. I think nobody is too busy to write morning. It takes seconds. \n\nI really dont understand if he loves me or not. \n\nTDLR; my bf was too interested and showed attention in the beginning. But after 3 months he is acting so reckless. It annoys me.",

He had a painful breakup months before we got closer.  We've become more involved with each others families and I'm leaving for active duty soon.\n\nWe decided to get engaged while working on our goals. Since he travels and I'll be away I won't see him a lot so it didn't seem like a bad idea. We would technically just live together and just grow closer. We genuinely do love each other and treat one another like lovers and best friends. And I felt it would be fine but perhaps that was youthful thinking. \n\n I expressed my growing feelings towards him after he said he was emotionally unavailable by saying this: You're not ready for anything deeper because of your break up before. You're emotionally unavailable. I do think you should be alone. At first I felt stupid for allowing myself to fall for you slowly. It's not in full affect I'd say because it's hard for me to really see past some things rn. But I do really love you more and more each day. But I realize that what's best for me to do. Is to love you how I can but also allow you to heal, and find who you are alone and what you really want/need in the people in your life going forward.\"\n\nHe responded by saying this: \"I love our relationship and couldn't have asked for anything better when it comes to you but myself,  I been starting to feel like I'm moving fast again.  I need to slow myself down again. I haven't been talking much cause I'm stretching just a Lil thin doing alot of things, and my brain can't keep up. I really appreciate your support though. \"\n\nWhat I'm getting from this is he doesn't want me in anyway but sexually and as close friend until he heals. I don't want him to have to tell me twice that he isnt into me. Hes still my best friend but I dont think I can allow myself to love him deeper. So I'm thinking I'm going to cut off everything sexual and our engagement.  I would get too wrapped up eventually and that's going be painful for me in the future since he isnt into me the same. In essence, I am silly for allowing myself to get here and its not smart for both of us.\n\nTLDR:  I'd like to know from the you guys before I finalize it if I got the right idea and should pull away?",

However she FaceTimed me from the same airbnb. \n\nHer reasoning was that she has an important police case so she couldn’t talk about it as her identity is getting frauded. \n\nI went to go see her and I saw a dating app on her phone but she said it was from an old reboot and that the app was deleted. \n\nThen I come back to the UK and she said she’s going to New York for the weekend and out of curiosity i made a fake profile and I saw her account on the same dating app with screenshotted photos but one of them was a photo which I took which she never uploaded on social media. \n\nI questioned it and I was angry and I admit a little disrespectful and she’s saying because her account has been hacked before all her photos are out there including original uploads on the dating app. She mentioned her iCloud was hacked a few months ago but not again. \n\nI’ve asked for access to her social media because I felt a bit insecure and needed reassurance but she denied me access as she said ‘because you’re mad you’re going to overthink and connect random dots together’. The moment I questioned her about the dating app, it disappeared and went offline within 2 minutes of our call. \n\nI want full transparency between us and my gut feeling believes her but I’m asking for emails to show that she reported the account and she isn’t giving it. \n\nShe also wants space ‘as I have been disrespectful and don’t know if she can continue in this relationship because our fights have been bad’. \n\nI admit my wrong doings as I have gotten mad, accused her of cheating (due to my insecurities) and threatened to breakup a couple times because she isn’t giving me an answer. Even her lying about her whereabouts in a different city threw me off. \n\nI really want to believe her but it’s come across like I’m an accuser and I want it to work out but my gf is being difficult in showing me ‘proof for reassurance’. \n\nI will admit to my wrongdoings (especially threatening to breakup) and I understand how I damaged the relationship but I don’t know how to tackle or repair this relationship either. \n\nTldr: caught girlfriend potentially cheating on me on dating apps.

We are planning a future together as well, and are very committed.\n\nToday I found an old USB that I didn\\`t even realize was his, until I put it in the computer. I looked because I thought it was mine and I wanted to use it, so I checked what was on it and I found a bunch of folders with images from his past. Some were family, some were vacations etc, but in a lot of them were images of him and his ex (exes?, I think there was more than one ex - but I didn˙t even look further, because I cound´t stand looking at him with another woman). I have never seen these, nor did I want to see them, and seeing him in photos with other women in loving/erotic poses and such, really hurt me.\n\nI don\\`t know why he still has them, he probably forgot they were on the USB, but it still hurt me a lot. I am a jealous person - but not in a way where I wouldn´t let him be around women or anything, to be clear - I get very jealous and hurt when I see his past, which is already behind him. I think he should˙ve deleted those when they broke up, otherwise I don´t know why he would˙ve kept them, let alone kept them on an USB that I could´ve mistakenly looked at, like I did today. It could be an honest mistake, forgetting they were there, but still... It hurt me!\n\nHe isn´t at home now, he comes back in 2 days and I plan on confronting him. I love him dearly, but I will not stand for this. I will ask why he has them still and tell him to delete the images without hesitation, or I am done. We are planning a future together and if he doesn´t delete these - delete his past, I can´t trust that we can move forward. The past is the past for a reason. He should not have those photos, especially if he plans on marrying me.\n\nAm I overreacting or am I right in thinking those should´ve been deleted a long time ago. What should I do?\n\nTL;DR - Today I found photos of my boyfriend and his ex on an old USB drive and got very hurt by seeing the images.",

        "text": " \n\nSo I have been having a brilliant time with my girlfriend of around 2 months; we connect on pretty much every level and I'm pretty sure I'm in love with her. Anyway as we dated I found out about her past, now I'm a pretty l liberal guy when it comes to sex; so I didn't mind her having a promiscuous phase whereas I am very selective about who I sleep with. So last night I come to find out that one of the guys she has slept with; lets call him L is actually my boss, and not just some middle management boss but the top dog that I report to, he's much older. Now usually I laugh these things off; I sort of did but honestly this alot for me. Now to be honest I am very open in relationship; like the sort of guy to say I had a massive shit or something in the sense that I am not afraid to make myself look bad.\n\nAnyway, she had a one night stand with L; apparently he's nowhere near as good in bed as I am; but this is even stranger because me and L are sort of buddies; I've gotten into a street fight and defended him from being jumped but there is still this weird sort of professional boundary between us and I'm not sure how he is going to take it if I show up to events with her. I'm also not sure who it was that decided to not see each other anymore.\n\nSo to the final discussion point; for which I would love input from the limited details I can provide. My gf got out of a toxic relationship around a year ago and fell in love with her dodgeball coach, much older and had a month long relationship with him where he treated her amazingly but eventually dumped her due to their age gap. She has told me that it was the best month of her life; and though she sends me love songs etc, sometimes she plays songs that remind her of him and she has sometimes made comments about how good at sex he was but then would say I'm better or it feels different with me. Again I'm super open; but I haven't said anything like, my ex had rounder boobs than you or something like that. She has been nothing but loving; but some of the comments about it being her best time; taking care of herself better and the love songs sometimes have me wondering. I have asked her as if something is on my mind I can't shake it; if she is over him. She has said yes but still there is a feeling. \n\nIt is not a deal breaker but I want to know what you guys think. Interestingly she had this promiscuous phase between him and meeting me. Life is nothing but grey but even this manages to make me chuckle; I am quite a simple guy leading a simple life that I am content with; I hope my lack of drama isn't boring boring to her. But as much as I like her; I don't need her, she's a great compliment to my life but I'm just thinking about these things. Hopefully I'll get some mental resolution from you guys, but I'm off to drop her off some croissants from our favourite shop.\n\n \\---  \\*\\*TL;DR;\\*\\* : My girlfriend has had a one night stand with my boss, should I bring her to events with him? And I'm not sure if she's over her ex?",

        "text": "tldr: My(25F) boyfriend(28M) moved to another city after a fight about a proposal and I'm not sure if I should get back with him or move on.\n\nWe've been living apart for the last month and he doesn't reach out to me . We used to be groupmates at university for a few months before he dropped out and both had a crush at each other. He reached out to me five years later when he broke up with his ex and I was trying to get out of a relationship that was not working. We were together for almost five years, moving together in just three months after we started dating. We had financial problems starting our carreers living paycheck to paycheck but for the first two years it was amazing. Then I found out I had a growing interest to one of my colleagues and to my shame commited emotional cheating(talking a lot via text, taking a walk after work to a bus stop together). Me and my bf had fights and I chose to work on myself and stay commited to him, getting therapy, antidepressants and consulting a gyno because of my lack of arousal but it was hard to deal with self-hatred resulting in nicotine addiction, thoughts of ending myself and slight SH. We got a pup from a shelter which filled me with hope and gave me strenght to get better. By this time we were forced to work from home because of the pandemic. \n\nIn 2021 he finally got a well paid job and I rescued a puppy from the street nearby which inspired me to work harder on my skills and get promoted but I came to a dead end being burntout from work and constant dog training(she was a bit feral and I decided to postpone her operation so she got in heat for the first time and was acting agressive). I persisted, spending my free time on building a loft bed with crates for each pup, organising our workspaces, etc.\n\nThen, certain political events came that made me think of fleeing the country, as I was disgusted and afraid with it. I suggested a plan where we get married(as to not get separated somewhere), revaccinate our pets, get our docs in order, pack up and leave. We went out to the nearest malls to buy cheap rings when he said he still wants to propose to me and that it's important to him to keep it romantic. Then, he proceeded to fail with the docs(I got mine in a month). He even lost the main one that we'd need to get a marriage certificate and refused to get it restored for some time. I was trying to play it cool and wait till he gets everything done but he never did. When I asked him about the docs, he only replied with \"fails happen, you know\".\n\nI was blaming myself for the situation, so I got back to therapy, flew to another city to see a psychiatrist and got diagnosed with ADHD and ASD(specialists in my city only diagnosed me with neurasthenia). I was learning to work with those conditions using CBT, DBT and schema therapy, learning techniques of NVC to communicate with him my want to change the fact that we're stuck in both the country and our relationship, as I was waiting for 8 months for him to propose as he said he wanted to. I only got a response of \"I'm tired from working, I want you to go to bed early do I can have private time gaming\". It hurt me but I tried to give him time to relax which was never enough.\n\nIn January, I got worked up with my thoughs about the proposal and why he wasn't even attempting to make it and he was only stonewalling me when I asked. This led to ugly fights with him saying he doesn't get enough time alone so I suggested he went to his homecity to stay with his friends for some time. He didn't listen until one morning early February when I started crying because he refused to go out to a pottery class or anywhere else and refused to discuss any date at home for Valentine's day. I was feeling abandoned as I wanted to spend time together and he just shut the conversation. As I was crying, he approached me saying \"Oh, I see you wanna fight again\", and I lost it telling him I hate him for making me feel unworthy of love and attention. I was leaving for gym and opening the door, when I noticed his keys were in the lock, so I threw them on the floor and left with mine. While I was at the gym, he packed up a few things, texted me smth like \"I accept your offer\" and left. I was shocked but I decided he needs time so I texted one of his friends assuming BF went to another city(he never said where he was going) to check on him and make sure he's ok. \n\nBF said he was not ready to talk for a week, so I wrote him a long letter about problems we had, apologizing for pushing him into buying rings and for demanding attention. After a week, I sent it, and he shortly replied telling me the same stuff about me being too clingy and him not being able to relax when I'm awake. He then wrote me about wanting to return but I was fed up with his response so I asked him to only pick up his stuff and find a place to take the second dog as I was tired from taking six walks a day everyday while working fulltime. \n\nHe came for his stuff, we cried a lot telling each other we still love each other a lot. I packed everything he'd need to be comfortable and he left. After another week I packed stuff for the dog and sent her to his place in a taxi for pets. \n\nIt's been almost a month and he never texted me first. I reached out to him about some errands, how the dog's doing, etc and he replied. This makes me unsure of his intentions. He says he's busy with his work and studying but I think he just doesn't want to reach out or doesn't understand we can be together only if he shows more effort. \n\nNow I'm unsure if I should fight for the relationship. I come from a family where \"keeping a man\" was my mother's primary interest even when it was clearly selfdestructing and it feels me with despair. I've been in relationships(my ex, then my current BF) for the last eight years and I feel pressure from my family being called irresponsible not being married with kids by 25 but I can't cut ties with them because of my litle sisters(11 and 6). If I fight, how do I tell him I want him to take more responsibility in our life together? How do I keep our boundaries clear and safe if weget back together?\n\nOr is it healthier to let go of this relationship? The thought of ending it is very painful and I don't get if it has already ended or not. This inbetween stage has taken its toll on me, as I'm currently not really able to eat or sleep or work as I should. I'm constantly thinking about it even when I try to keep myself busy building new furniture, painting, crocheting etc. I'm tired of reaching out to him and I don't know how to ask about our status without getting into a fight once again.\n\nI already talked about the whole thing with two of my best friends and they're on my side. One of them said I was dealing with the situation like a shaolin monk(lol) but honestly, on the inside I am a total mess. I can't really ask them for advice anymore as they have their own problems so I found the subreddit. I'm hoping to get a new perspective and open to any opinions.",

        "text": "My friend \"Paul\" (26m) whom I've had a on/off friendship with since highschool, re-entered my life 5 years ago and we became good friends since that don't talk so much. He was a groomsmen at my wedding 3 years ago. I was just told that I'm a groomsmen for his upcoming wedding. All is great for a week.\n\nWe all are participants in a playstation group voice chat, the groom, groomsmen, and others; that we all hop on and off throughout the day. One time, I enter the chat and a joke/statement is made that makes me feels unwanted and I ask if they'd rather I go; they told me it was unnecessary, and despite it being uncomfortable for a second, we moved on and continued to have a good chat. Two days later, my friend \"Remy\" (25m), tells me that he was in a chat with all of the party, without me, where they were insulting me for 3-5 minutes, saying that I was annoying and that they wouldn't enter the chat if it was just myself there, etc. \n\nThe wedding is in 6 months; I was just told this information, so I'm not sure how to navigate. Given the scenario, I'm starting to feel that I was chosen as a groomsmen out of obligation for me having him as a groomsmen. I'm wondering if I should ask the groom about this, because if they'd prefer to have someone else over me for a more comfortable wedding party, I'm all for it. Remy would prefer that I don't say anything about it as he thinks it'd bounce back at him for telling me. That being said, I'm at a loss of what to do. I'm not mad nor do I want to cause drama; I want the best for Paul, but if Paul and the others feel this way about me, I don't want to drag the wedding party down by being there out of obligation. Any advice?\n\n**tldr: groom and groomsmen insulted me behind my back, and if that's how they feel, I want to give the option to replace me if that means a better wedding party for them, but I don't know if I should even bring up that I heard this to the groom.**",

        "text": "I F(26) was seeing a guy M(30) for seven years. I found out he has been in a serious relationship with someone else F(25) the past six months. I was SHOCKED. He was seeing me at least five times a week, getting hotel rooms with me, and at least twice a day. I was like how and why see me so often? He was seeing me after dates with her. \n\nI met up with him and I asked why not dump me? He said that her family has a lot of money. She pays for their dates. I was grossed out, he may have been sleeping with us both the same day. I would want to know. \n\nI messaged the girl and her family to let them know what was going on. The family was pissed. I met up with the family in person. I gave them my phone and said I don’t care about my privacy go through it (I had nude pics of me in our messages, none of him). I showed the chat log was from his number and gave free reign. Also let them go through our Facebook messenger account. \n\nThe company the guy I was seeing worked for was owned by the girlfriends brother. He said he was his best friend of over the years and he got him a job and repaid him by cheating on his little sister… ON THE CLOCK. The messages proved he was fucking me in the work truck so the guy was paying him to cheat on the sister. \n\nThe girl was mad at me for blowing up his spot. She said I am lying and she will prove his innocence. She chose to stay with him. The family thanked me, but it left me confused. \n\nThe guy messaged me asking me to lie. He said he will go to the police for defamation and harassment and I will get a record unless I lie. He said he will ruin my life like I ruined his. I refused to lie. \n\nThe other day I made a new tinder account. I saw him and super liked it we matched. This is a new account. He’s still with her. \n\nShe’s 25 and never had a bf and is extremely introverted. \n\nShould I tell the family? Why match with me? Why not just sleep with the girlfriend?\n\nTL;DR: guy I was seeing had a gf. I told her and her entire family he was cheating on her sexually five times a week and proved it. She decided to stay with him. I just matched with him on tinder. It’s been a month and the family wants me to tell them info. What do I do?",

        "text": "Long story short, I'm an autistic (yet goofy) individual who happened to be bullied alot in high school. I wasn't liked by the \"cool kids\", I was that autistic nerd that loved playing world of warcraft, magic the gathering, anime, marvel - you get the idea, these things make me super happy. I was the student that formed a friend's club at school, so everyone can have an opportunity to meet others &amp; not feel alone. That's where the bullying came in, I was always picked on by a group a jerk simply because they thought I was weird &amp; made fun of my autism. I was getting beaten up, no one stepped in but this one guy did: the guy that would be my best friend, who we'll call Andrew. \n\nAndrew is 3 years older than me, I just turned 18 &amp; he's 21. He was a senior, I was a freshman. He actually defended me, hopped in and attacked my bully. He didn't leave after that either, he held me and took me to the nurses office. You know what the amazing part was? Andrew didn't leave at all. He stayed with me at the nurses office, made sure I was doing okay. This was when our friendship started and I'm blessed to have met him. He invited me everywhere, wanted to get to know me &amp; took interest in my hobbies. He was the sweetest, kindest and greatest person I've ever met and he still is till this day. I have trouble focusing in class, so he always helped me with my homework &amp; not once did he treat me different due to my autism. I felt I could be myself around him, I felt safe and loved.\n\nSo before he graduated that year, I introduced him to my mom (she was 30 at the time) because I simply couldn't shut up about him to her. She really appreciated everything he had done for me, she welcomed him into our home and was incredibly thankful for being a great friend to me. She did jokingly embarrass me by saying I always talk about Andrew, but he really appreciated that i thought highly of him. After this, we invovled him with our fun activities. We all went to the beach, went to theme parks &amp; comic cons - it was the greatest time of my life. He became a family friend immediately, I'll even say he was my first genuine friend that actually cared about me. \n\nAfte he graduated, he went to a local community College &amp; we spent the entire summer together. Again, our fun actives didn't end. Andrew, my mother &amp; I all spent time together constantly. He was like a brother to me, I wanted to be with him all the time and the fact that he was with me made me feel happy. He also believed in me, said I was going to do beautiful things in life and encouraged me to do well in school. Aside from my mom, he was the second person in my life to treat me with respect. He told me on my birthday how much he loved me and treasured our friendship. We got matching spider-man rings, which is awesome cause he's my favorite superhero.\n\nIn a weird way, he felt like my dad. I really hope that makes sense. He always checked to see if I was doing good, if I needed anything, help with anything, wanted to talk - he was very protective of me, which is something I've never had with another male individual. He felt like a father figure to me, someone I looked up to - even if he was only 3 years older than me.\n\nWell here we are now, 3 years later and still the best of friends. Although, something has now changed. Andrew and my mother (who's now 32) have spoken to me about something pretty big. They both admitted to being in a relationship for quite a while, they began dating a year after Andrew's graduation. They wanted to be honest with me, as they really want to become serious &amp; not keep it to themselves. They want to be public about it, not feel hidden and they wanted me to know about their love for each other. They said they didn't want to hurt me &amp; understood if I was upset.\n\nHow do I feel? I feel happy! My best friend who I absolutely love is dating and making my own mother happy. Why should I be mad? These are 2 people I care about with all my heart, I think it's beautiful they found love with each other and I appreciate that they were honest with me about their relationship. Andrew did pull me to the side, said he understood if things would be weird. He told me he cared about me and doesn't want to hurt me. He told me he understood if I wanted him and my mom to stop seeing each other. I told him no, that they're grown ups &amp; that I'm happy my mom is with someone like him. \n\nEver since this day, they've been happily together. Yes, he does stay in our house a few times a week &amp; I don't mind one bit. If it were for me, I wouldn't mind if he was officially living with us. I think it'll be nice to have him around, I feel very safe &amp; cared for around him.\n\nAm I wrong for supporting Andrew and my mother being together? I had a friend of mine complain how weird it was, said I should be upset. But why should I? I love and think highly of Andrew, I know he cares and would never hurt my mom. Yes a few friends have said some dumb things, they believe it's just weird &amp; that I'm wrong for allowing it. I simply want to ask you all, am I wrong for being okay with this? I don't see anything wrong with their relationship, maybe it's just me.\n\nI'll appreciate your honest thoughts on this. The comments my friends have made definitely are sticking in my mind, I should totally ignore them but unfortunately I can't. Their comments keep replaying in my mind, which is bugging me so much. I wish they can see this whole thing like how I see it, but they don't which I do understand completely.\n\nTl;DR: my mother &amp; best friend are officially together and I'm happy. My friend's think I'm wrong for allowing it, but I personally feel it's okay. I'm happy that my mom and best friend are together.",

        "text": " Ill try and put as much information as I can but since a lot has been going on and with how long we have been in a relationship its going to be difficult. Anyways as the title says I have been together with my gf for about 7 years now, we met on a game and became quick friends and our relationship developed just as fast, over the years we only grew closer and we started meeting up IRL a lot more frequently. While we do live in the same country she still lives quite a distance away from me, specifically I'm on the mainland and she lives on a very small island so you need a boat or plane to cross.\n\nSometime last year we met again and this time it was at my house and she stayed over for a month, it was the longest we have ever stayed together and we both seemed to really love it, as usual tears were shed when we had to part but overall it was a great time. I remember a comment from her family asking when I would take her back as as she just seemed so much healthier in many ways.\n\nFast forward a few months later and things start turning a bit sour, now for context we never argued through our entire relationship so far, we just never had any reason too and we just worked things out by talking, But we were having silly little arguments that you wouldn't normally have if you were together, for example saying goodnight was one of them, I'll be honest I would get back home from a hard day of work and just jump into bed and forget to say it. I talked to my my friend who was also in a long distance relationship for 2-3 years but is now engaged to his gf and is now moved in with each other, I talked with him about the arguments we were having and the struggles and he basically told me that those would most likely go away if you were living together, just like with him.\n\nAfter that conversation and having another silly argument with my gf I brought it up about us living together and how it would make things so much easier and we seemed so inseparable from each other that I didn't think it would be an issue. Oh lord I was wrong, that turned into another BIG argument, to put it in short, she told me no because she didn't want to leave her family and that she didn't want what happened in college to happen again (She lives with her parents, she went to college on the mainland and some stuff happened, she quit college half way through and went back to live with her family, its been about 5 years since), of cause I was really hurt by this as why would she think I would let what happened to her in college happen with me. In the end after some backwards and forwards she basically offered to break up because she 100% refuses to move out of her parents house. In the end that didn't happen and I basically told her that I am not waiting forever for her to get help and get better, how long would I have to wait, a few weeks? Months? Years? when I'm a old lady? She doesn't know and I feel like I'm wasting my life away for something that's not going to happen. she says staying with her parents is helping her but with how long it has been I doubt that very much as nothing has changed and she doesn't work anymore, just sits in her room on the computer most of the days but will sometimes go partying with her friends.\n\nForgot to add this part but she seemed somewhat okay living with me as long as it was on the island close to her family but the thing is, I don't want to live there, it was good to visit but to live there I would end up miserable. We both live in the country side but that island has nothing, I love going hiking around my area as it has so many mountains, forests, lakes and trials, hiking is just something I love to do but its not really something you can do there, there's barely any trees, you got one \"mountain\" and a load of flat land, I want to explore the outdoors and not be constrained to one small place. Island life is just not for me. But I did offer her that I would be willing to go as close to the island as possible on the mainland so she could still very easily see her family and yeah that would mean I'm willing to move so far away from my own family and friends just for her but she doesn't want to make any compromises.\n\nOver the months it has been horrendous, constant arguing, silent treatments, snapping at each other for the littlest of things and nothing is going progressing anymore. She did say she will try and get help and she did ask for it and is on a waiting list, not sure when she was added as she don't tell me anything anymore and I had to ask if she was even trying but it has been about 2 months now on this waiting list.\n\nHonestly I'm so stressed and depressed that I don't know what to do, she's constantly on my mind but I don't know if this is a healthy relationship anymore.. I need help on what I Should do, splitting up has been on my mind for a while now but I don't know if I can live without her. I want this to work out so badly but I feel like I'm grasping at straws. Should I wait longer maybe, should I change how I approach things, what should I do, I'm so miserable right now.\n\nThere is a few things missing but ill edit this post or leave a comment if more context is necessary.\n\n TL;DR: I have a long distance relationship of 7 years with my girlfriend but she doesn't want to move out of her parents house or away from the island she lives on to be with me but I don't want to live on a island. Tried compromising but she wont budge.",

        "text": "So my (soon to be ex) wife, this girl, and I all work at the same place but not all in the same area. We've worked together for about 3 years but she's started talking to me more in the past year, specifically since I've become a dad.\n\nShe's quiet, shy, and reserved but she's become increasingly chatty with me and I find these days she really tries to keep the conversation flowing. She asks me a lot more personal stuff and volunteers it often as well. I thought maybe this was because she knew my wife, but apparently they aren't really friends (don't dislike each other just don't interact much). This girl has even forgotten my wife's name a couple times when asking about her.\n\nWe had a particularly good conversation the other day, and I feel like her body language was good. It may not be interest, but I feel like she's at least comfortable with me. She was making a lot of eye contact with me, much more than she used to. She was sitting across from me and had her legs crossed, but her uncrossed leg was pointing towards me, and her crossed leg was making her pants noticeably tighter. She also had her head tilted to the side (resting on the wall) kind of exposing her neck, but she wears her hair back so it's hard to say whether that was purposeful or just comfortable for her. We would occasionally break eye contact and then regain it, not sure if that's good or bad? She would look away when telling me something that seemed like it was painful. For example, when she told me her mom passed away she'd look down for a few seconds. But when talking about happy things (like our kids) she'd usually maintain prolonged eye contact. If she did look away she'd look down for a couple seconds and then look back. My friend also said to see if her voice is higher pitched when speaking to me, and I would say occasionally yes imo.\n\nWe actually had a really in depth talk about personal stuff such as where we grew up, our family members, parents who have passed away, our kids (she's a single mom), etc. She also started asking about where my family live now, what nickname I have for my son, etc. She's also started getting more... vulnerable I guess, talking about cost of living pressure and stuff like that. Not super in depth, just passing comments but still ones revealing personal information. She also started telling me how she feels about our town, frustrations she's had with finding things to do (particularly with her kid), etc.\n\nMy friend happened to be there for the conversation and afterwards he said \"She sure likes you.\" I asked what he meant and he said she never talks to him that much, only pleasantries. Upon talking to some of the other guys I work with, they've all basically said the same thing. She did briefly interact with this guy while I was there, but only when I brought him into the conversation and she didn't seem like she knew what to say to him.\n\nAnother thing, she's been making more jokes with me and laughing my (very lame) jokes. The other day I could tell she was looking for someone and I said \"Hey you look lost, you ok?\" Our eyes met, she had a really big smile, and then looked down. She giggled a bit and said \"Oh yeah, I'll find myself in a minute.\" or something kinda dorky like that.\n\nShe could just be more comfortable with me, but I feel like she's taken a particular interest in me the last 6 to 12 months as I said. About 7 months or so back, we had a conversation about my son and ever since then she's much more talkative to me. Not sure if they're related. She's said once she's good at judging people's vibes, so maybe she just thinks I'm a good dad and is more comfortable with me now idk.\n\nAgain, not going to get mixed up with this, at least for the foreseeable future (until wife and I are officially split and also my wife is changing jobs eventually) but it would be good to know at least for future reference because I kinda suck at taking hints, but also don't want to make something out of nothing.\n\nI guess part of me thinks she knows I'm married and she knows my wife directly, so I think why would she be interested/showing interest. She doesn't know my wife and I are splitting yet. It's really hard to say because she isn't as expressive as most women I know.\n\nTL;DR - Not sure if my coworker is reservedly flirting with me because I'm (technically) still married, or whether she's just comfortable with me.",

        "text": " Me and my gf go to a pub quiz regularly. It is on every week and we like to go once or twice a month. The quiz is always themed so it's nice if it's something we both like but even when it is something only one of us likes it's still a fun night since we really like the food and drinks from the bar.\n\nThis means I've gone to quizzes with my gf that I know nothing about but that she loves and vice versa. This week was the quiz I had been looking forward to the most since it was on something I love but had never seen a quiz about before. As soon as the quiz was announced last month me and my gf made plans to go. The bar recently updated their food menu so we were also looking forward to trying that out. Alongside the quiz we made plans for a day out and to go to mini golf on saturday.\n\nLas week my gf made plans to meet up with her best friend last weekend. The day after she had met her friend she told me she couldn't afford the quiz since she had spent too much with her friend. I pointed out that I always pay for the food and her first drink anyway so since it's only a couple of hours she could just make the drink last if she had no money at all or only get one drink if she still had some money. I also suggested pushing our Saturday plans back a few weeks instead but she said no.\n\nShe knew how much I was looking forward to us going and at short notice I couldn't get anyone to go with me. The night of the quiz I was disappointed that I wasn't there and my gf kept asking what was wrong despite me telling her i was just disappointed we were missing the quiz. She then proceeds to sit on her laptop and spend over £30 on clothes. When she told me what she'd bought I mentioned to her that her excuse for not going to the quiz was a lie then. She disagreed and said she couldn't afford it but couldn't answer when I asked how she had the money to spend on clothes when she didn't even have the money for a drink at the quiz.\n\nShe said I was out of line and was being unreasonable and I told her she shouldn't be lying to me and she knew how much I was looking forward to the quiz. She just repeated that she couldn't help it and called me an AH for questioning her. Does anyone have any advice?\n\ntl;dr my gf cancelled plans because she couldn't afford them then spends money on clothes and got defensive/annoyed when I called her out for lying to me. Does anyone have any advice?",

For context, he has a lot of days off from work usually 3/7 days in a week, he has off, and on those days he already plays video games all day, whilst i'm in class. Yesterday, he told me that \"we would have the night to ourselves\" today, and i was looking forward to spending time with him. Now, he's told me 'my friend messaged me saying that he's going to play the game tomorrow after work, is it okay if i join him?\". My brain was definitely crying inside, this isn't the first time he's done this, and I feel so unimportant when he does. I feel like his question puts me in an awkward position, if I say no, I seem controlling and I'm not trying to force him to spend time with me, the want to do that has to come from him. I feel so unimportant and as though video games are more important than me, or our relationship. Any advice is greatly appreciated ❤️\n\nTL;DR : My boyfriend told me he'd spend time with me today, and then asked me if it was okay if he played the game with his friend when he got home",

Her smile is mythically charming and her voice stupefies me completely attracting my full attention when only I hear her asking \"how are you?\"\n\nShe's a senior IT specialist at the company and I'm with the general maintenance department. She's a citizen and I'm a newly arrived immigrant. Classics, right? We're not in the U.S. by the way. Most days she works from home so we don't see each other close but even on the days she's at the office I try not to annoy or bother her with my presence. I'm hyper-cautious and don't want to cause any distress to her, don't want her to feel like she's being watched or stalked, though the desire is merely irresistible.\n\nI consider my job relatively good and wish to keep it while I'm learning the new language and, well, until, I guess, the breakthrough in films. I'm a scriptwriter and film director at the beginning of my filmmaking career and am currently in preproduction for just my second short.\n\nOne day I saw her from afar and she seemed to be deeply upset by something or someone. The next day I brought her a plant as a gift to cheer her up. She loves plants. We've exchanged kind thank you notes and that was it. The whole interaction, by the way, wasn't in person - I left a plant with a note on her desk, and she left a thank you note (with a few of the most delicious joints I've ever smoked) for me at the reception, and then I left another note, a thank you note from me, on her desk when she was absent of course.\n\nTD;LR: I'm a man, and men are dumb and really, like really-really unsophisticated and naive, sometimes arrogant even, when it comes to interpreting so-called signals from women.

We will write both sides of the problems.\n\n\\- English is not our first language so sorry for any mistake.\n\nI will start with my side of the problem:\n\nI (28M) have been going out with Lily (28F) for 10 years, married for 4. We have known each other since the beginning of High school. I have to specify this since our high school years are the core of the question: we hated our high school years. We were both outcast. We were bullied, laughed at and we were the butt of the jokes most of the times. This was mostly due to our appearance. I was fat, still wore a brace and suffered from asthma ( I fainted a couple of times during PE). For me, HS was bad but it was not my first time dealing with bullies, as I had to do it during middle school too ( mostly for the same reasons). While this didn't make HS more bearable, I at least didn't have the \"shock\" of suddenly being picked on. Lily was my only friend and, throughout the 5 years of HS, I developed a crush on her and ended up confessing shortly before graduation, when I found out we were going to attend the same college. We have been dating ever since. \n\nAfter graduating HS, we both bloomed. My asthma subsided, I removed the brace ( finally!) and I was finally able to start doing sport and lost a lot of weight.\n\nAfter graduating college, we both got a good paying job are doing fine now ( we aren't rich but we are quite wealthy). Once we were stable enough, I proposed to her and we got married. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, we received a mail for our 10 year HS reunion. It will be in July. I don't want to go. Before someone ask, it's not for any kind of complex or fear. I simply think we have come so far from those bad days and I don't see a reason to go to an event where you are meant to remember those moment. Lily insists we go and basically show off ( I'm paraphrasing but that's the gist of it).\n\nOk, my side of the problem is over so I will let Lily write hers. Bye.\n\nHi Reddit, Lily here. How are you doing? Hopefully well. So, I will try to sum things up as much as possible in order to not annoy any of you. \n\nHS was a crappy period. I suffered from a grave case of acne and my body didn't develop until I was 17 so I became a target for bullies and mean girls. It's embarrassing to admit but I used to cry a lot at the time. If I could, I would erase those year from my mind but there was one good thing that happened in those years that makes it worth it: I met Leo. He was also bullied and yet he kept smiling to me and moving on despite everything. He made those unbearable days a little less shitty and at the same time, he made me hate those people even more: I was shy, introvert and had uncommon taste both in music and cinema so I can understand being picked on by bullies. Leo is a kind spirit, he always was like that and he always tried to be friend with everybody he knew. Why were they picking on him? Why did they have to make him feel so miserable? I could literally see how hurt he was every time he tried to fit in only to be shunned again. Why? Just why?\n\nWe have been through a lot together and we kept moving on against all odds.\n\nWe recently got an invitation for our HS reunion. Leo says I want to go just to show off and, well, yeah, I do. I want to show to my former classmates how far we have come, how much we have grown since those days. I think it would be cathartic for the both of us. Leo disagrees. He says that the best way to prove how much we have grown is to simply move on from the whole thing and enjoy our life. While from a logical pov I agree, from a sentimental pov, I want to go anyway.\n\nWe want to thank in advance everybody for their opinion and advice. Bye.\n\nTL;DR: Our HS 10 year reunion is in few months. I don't want to go. My wife want to go.",

They just talked about their night out and doing it again. \n\nThe messages were from Saturday night, he’d gone out with three friends (all in relationships). I picked them up around 2 am and took them all home. I noticed he was messaging someone but didn’t really think about it properly till last night. \n\nWhen I confronted him about it, he said they’d just been sat together at the pub and started chatting. Ones in a relationship but her partner doesn’t like going out, the other was reluctant to be there as she’d been spiked last time she was out. When they parted ways he exchanged numbers “to make sure they were safe” .\nI guess that’s sweet of him. After texting them he asked for their Snapchat’s. He’s not sure why he did it but he did. He swears it’s nothing and that nothing happened or was gonna happen. \n\nI’m not sure how I feel about it. Am I overthinking? Is it just innocent? \n\nThe problem is that he’s done other stuff through the 7years we’ve been together. I’ve caught him sexting with other girls during our third year. Then he said he had an addiction to porn after being caught paying to talk to girls.\n\nOur sex life hasn’t been the same since moving into my dad’s house. He’s not been interested and it’s nearly alway me that starts it. We have sex maybe twice a month. Think the longest was two and a half just before covid. I then went to Australia for a month to visit family and the distance seemed to fix things between us. I came back as everything started to shut down and we enjoyed our little covid bubble. \n\nHe blamed it on people being in which I understand but he never had that problem when we would stay at his mums. He’s also blamed the porn addiction for a while. Rumours were spread in his and my old friend group that he wasn’t interested in me anymore after a night out watching amateur boxing. He was the one to tell me about it as he denied it being true, that someone interpreted him looking at the number girls  wrongly. \n\nAm I being naive? In between all this he is so great, the perfect boyfriend. He’s been there for my hardest times, we’ve planned a future together and we’ve been together nearly all my adult life.\n\nTL;DR my partner took the number of a girl he met on a night out “to check they’re safe”  then added them on snap chat. Is this the last straw? Or am I overreacting?",

        "text": "I (30F) work in a male dominated industry. Unfortunately I am also (mostly) straight, single and veeery attracted to intelligence, as well as ambition, problem solvers, well dressed people, people who challenge me... basically all the kinds of things that manifest themselves best in my kinds of workplaces. It feels IMPOSSIBLE not to crush on coworkers...\n\nMy track record is a little under 1 fairly intense crush per year. My last relationship actually stemmed from someone in the workplace. Fortunately he was in a distant team, I was just an intern, and he quit after a few months so it didn't complicate work too much. But I do remember struggling not to think about him at work and struggling not to message him constantly over the work messaging system.\n\nWith the latest crush, I seem to be going full-blown red-faced &amp; tachycardic whenever he and I have a 1 on 1 conversation. He was in my car the other week and I probably was a danger to the road, just from my brain being overloaded. As I'm writing this I realise I've now spent hours with blushed cheeks and a tight chest after an afternoon being the last people in the workplace together and talking for ages.\n\nThe problem is, I'm not just an intern anymore, and I work somewhere that I care about and am doing well in. I also don't want to set women back in this industry by flirting and being \"a distraction\" to colleagues. I definitely can't date anyone in a position where one of us could be the other's boss. But worst of all, by now they all have partners or wives.\n\nI'm pretty sure I have unintentionally flirted though. This was confirmed by the fact that one night a work crush sent me drunk texts (a night after he had fought with his partner) asking if I was attracted to him and saying he was to me --- he would never have done that if I hadn't given signals. Also if I'm being honest I think that I subconsciously adjust myself a lot around a crush, want to be around them / look at them a bit more than necessary, and tend to get those sheepish uncontrollable smiles. It's probably not \"obvious\" behaviour, but would be interpretable to anyone who knows me or has a keen eye.\n\nI obviously just need to \"get some\" outside the workplace, but given that I dislike dating apps and I struggle to be attracted to people whom I don't know well, it's just not happening. I know I should also avoid spending time with the crush but it's weirdly uncontrollable for me. Maybe I also need to get some other adrenaline in my life outside of work so I don't seek the person out or spend time thinking about them?\n\nHow do you \"just stop\" feeling it when the pull is so strong? I need reminders of why this is toxic and dangerous (examples please!)\n\nTLDR; My male dominated workplace is a pressure cooker for me liking someone, but I know it shouldn't be especially because they tend to be partnered already.",

And I told him, that I dont think we can be in a relationship anymore. We both have some mental health problems and I told him that we booth really need to take care of this problem first before being in an relationship. He cried and so did I my heart hurts so much because I still love him very much. But we have a lot of small problems which I dont think we can fix when we are together. We are really codependent and we dont really have different lives. He said that he will accept if I want to break up, but he really wants to stay together.\n\nI really dont know what to do anymore.

        "text": "So my (soon to be ex) wife, this girl, and I all work at the same place but not all in the same area. We've worked together for about 3 years but she's started talking to me more in the past year, specifically since I've become a dad.\n\nShe's quiet, shy, and reserved but she's become increasingly chatty with me and I find these days she really tries to keep the conversation flowing. She asks me a lot more personal stuff and volunteers it often as well. I thought maybe this was because she knew my wife, but apparently they aren't really friends (don't dislike each other just don't interact much). This girl has even forgotten my wife's name a couple times when asking about her.\n\nWe had a particularly good conversation the other day, and I feel like her body language was good. It may not be interest, but I feel like she's at least comfortable with me. She was making a lot of eye contact with me, much more than she used to. She was sitting across from me and had her legs crossed, but her uncrossed leg was pointing towards me, and her crossed leg was making her pants noticeably tighter. She also had her head tilted to the side (resting on the wall) kind of exposing her neck, but she wears her hair back so it's hard to say whether that was purposeful or just comfortable for her. We would occasionally break eye contact and then regain it, not sure if that's good or bad? She would look away when telling me something that seemed like it was painful. For example, when she told me her mom passed away she'd look down for a few seconds. But when talking about happy things (like our kids) she'd usually maintain prolonged eye contact. If she did look away she'd look down for a couple seconds and then look back. My friend also said to see if her voice is higher pitched when speaking to me, and I would say occasionally yes imo.\n\nWe actually had a really in depth talk about personal stuff such as where we grew up, our family members, parents who have passed away, our kids (she's a single mom), etc. She also started asking about where my family live now, what nickname I have for my son, etc. She's also started getting more... vulnerable I guess, talking about cost of living pressure and stuff like that. Not super in depth, just passing comments but still ones revealing personal information. She also started telling me how she feels about our town, frustrations she's had with finding things to do (particularly with her kid), etc.\n\nMy friend happened to be there for the conversation and afterwards he said \"She sure likes you.\" I asked what he meant and he said she never talks to him that much, only pleasantries. Upon talking to some of the other guys I work with, they've all basically said the same thing. She did briefly interact with this guy while I was there, but only when I brought him into the conversation and she didn't seem like she knew what to say to him.\n\nAnother thing, she's been making more jokes with me and laughing my (very lame) jokes. The other day I could tell she was looking for someone and I said \"Hey you look lost, you ok?\" Our eyes met, she had a really big smile, and then looked down. She giggled a bit and said \"Oh yeah, I'll find myself in a minute.\" or something kinda dorky like that.\n\nShe could just be more comfortable with me, but I feel like she's taken a particular interest in me the last 6 to 12 months as I said. About 7 months or so back, we had a conversation about my son and ever since then she's much more talkative to me. Not sure if they're related. She's said once she's good at judging people's vibes, so maybe she just thinks I'm a good dad and is more comfortable with me now idk.\n\nAgain, not going to get mixed up with this, at least for the foreseeable future (until wife and I are officially split and also my wife is changing jobs eventually) but it would be good to know at least for future reference because I kinda suck at taking hints, but also don't want to make something out of nothing.\n\nI guess part of me thinks she knows I'm married and she knows my wife directly, so I think why would she be interested/showing interest. She doesn't know my wife and I are splitting yet. It's really hard to say because she isn't as expressive as most women I know.\n\nTL;DR - Not sure if my coworker is reservedly flirting with me because I'm (technically) still married, or whether she's just comfortable with me.",

She told me that she only saw me as a friend, that she didn't want to have the extra pressure that a partner brings. She is bad at home, her parents don't have a good relationship with her, she has to work often and she has to get good grades so she is at home quite overwhelmed. \n\nShe told me she only wanted to be friends with me once, and once after two weeks of virtually no contact. After a while, we have continued to meet as friends, quite well, respecting the distances. Although yesterday I met her, and... we made out. \n\nIt's true that I warmed up the atmosphere a bit, but she seemed very nervous with me (for the best) and she was the one who started the kiss. She told me at the end that she didn't wanted to \"confuse things\". \n\nI am not getting my hopes up, I have learned to be calm and see the whole perspective. I don't know what to think, on the one hand I feel that she still feels something towards me (she asked me to meet for... you know) which I know can be done without feeling feelings towards the other person, but I know when someone feels something for me, and I notice it. \n\nOn the other hand, she keeps joking with me that she is talking to a lot of people and that she goes out partying etc etc. I don't know, what do you think?\n\nTL;DR",

        "text": "So I have a friend who dates a lot of guys but also seemingly has issues with all of them. We've both become pretty close friends and discuss a lot of personal things over the years. \n\nHowever, there is one thing that slightly bothers me whenever we talk about it: she seems to discourage me from finding people to date whenever I mention it for more than a few messages or days. She has called me desperate, told me maybe I don't need to date, questioned why I wanted to date and has made a few other dissuasive comments whenever I talked to her about things related to getting dates (I'm not even getting matches on online dating though). I guess I feel like it's a bit unfair because she's always talking about her guy problems and it also makes me feel undesirable.\n\nWhat's most confusing to me is that she has told me a number of times that she values and trusts my judgement, but at the same time it seems as if she thinks she knows me more than myself when she makes these comments.\n\nMy question is why is she behaving this way? Or could it be that I'm talking about dating girls too often (a couple of times every 2-3 months) / in desperate way and that annoys her?\n\nFYI, I've been told I was cute by girls a number of years ago when I dated and before I became busy with my career. Friends also often tell me I'm a nice person and have a sense of humor, so I don't think I'm some sort of jerk.\n\n**TL;DR:** Friend dissuades me from finding dates and says maybe I don't need one while she goes off to date a lot of guys and complains about her issues with them. It makes me feel undesirable and it seems unfair.",

My parents said that she'll probably just end up using the marriage as a chance to get away from her extremely controlling mom, which I believe. We talked about how she might just divorce him after a few years if it's really not meant to be. \n\nThe issue is that the man she married has already been married (which isn't a bad thing on its own). He got cheated on by his first wife and they divorced. If my cousin divorces him, he'll be in his early thirties looking for his third marriage, which would suck, especially as someone in a devout community. \n\nThe way I see it, my cousin is probably going to end up using this man, which is something I can't really see past. \n\nI don't have faith that she's doing the right thing, but now that she's already married do I just need to trust her? Is there a way to ask questions about her motivation for getting married that don't wildly overstep boundaries? If I understood her situation more I'd probably feel better about the situation, but I don't want her to think I'm judging her. \n\ntl;dr I have reasons to believe my cousin could be majorly screwing over her new husband, is it possible to broach the topic of their marriage without being an ass?",

        "text": "Hey I need some advice. I met this girl years ago. We flirted and hung out when we were young. It didn’t amount to much but just always had this attraction. I never seen her for years. Then a few years back. We start talking and I’m in the same city and I get her to come out on a date with me. We have fun, go out for dinner then a bar and we kiss and she says she wants to do this again. But we never hook up again. I leave the city for work. But I was always pursuing her. She randomly msgs me a few weeks ago and starts telling me that she’s done with who she was with and we’re talking about “dating” when we were young and stuff and so as it’s just after Valentine’s Day I said fuck this and I ask her out(which I don’t even live in the city, I’d have to travel to her city to see her, like 5 hours) and she turns me down but says it’s for a reason that she’s used to blow me off a few times before. She seems to be telling the truth there but I said alright yah know if yah don’t wanna see me then it’s ok, but i really just didn’t think you wanted to. She responds and we keep joking about stuff.And life goes on… by the weekend I ask her out again, she turns me down again then says she has a boyfriend. I say ok well the boyfriend doesn’t concern me especially sense I didn’t really think she had one anymore because she told me she was past it, I figured I just messed up. I tell her I’m going to try and take it easy just wanna make her feel pretty. And I do so, primarily that’s what our conversation is. Just jokes about everything. And at first sending photos and liking each other’s and I’m consistent with sending msgs for when she wakes up that say like your beautiful have a great day and stuff which she’d like I then came onto her again, she actually asked me if I was seeing anyone. Then the next day starts to ghost me, after the weekend says I’m being disrespectful after I send her a beautiful song and a joke. And I say look I figure your done talking to me again till next time sorry I didn’t want to be disrespectful. And she tells me I have to stop and that she’s not leaving her boyfriend. But I’m very drawn to her. I can’t stop thinking about this. I took the position that I want her. She’s got almost every quality I want as far as I can tell so far. And I wanna know more. I have no one to ask, so I figure I’ll give this a shot 🤷‍♂️ does it seem I’m wasting my time trying? She’s far away, and she’s tellin me she’s all the sudden with someone. But I’ve wanted her for a long time and I know there’s something here; she never told me to stop talking to her she only told me to stop asking her out. I stopped talking to her because as far as I know if she isn’t into the idea of dating me she’s just going to talk until someone else comes and go with them. I’ve been that guy before. Should I have tried to bond closer first? I’m terrible at this\n\nTL,DR! Need advice on pursuing a girl with history",

I still follow other people's boundaries but i dont have many boundaries of my own.\nAnyway, Emile is similar to me in that regsrd which may be why it's easy to mistake us for bf and gf.\n\nAlso, now for the bit I'm more concerned about:\nWill i have to distance from her a bit once i get a girlfriend?\nCos i don't want to be one of those shitty friends who sidelines their friends and barely hangs out once you get a girlfriend but at the same time i get why we would need to hangout less. For one thing so that i have more time to hang out with my girlfriend and for another maybe my girlfriend might find it a bit weird that im hanging out with another girl so much. Tho tbf Emile is lesbian so would she even care?\n\nWould appreciate a detailed walk-through of all this.\nAnd of course this all only really matters if i can get a girlfriend in the first place (Girls come up and talk to me quite often so ig im somewhat attractive/approachable but I've got 0 game so thats about as far as it gets), but that's an issue for another time.",
