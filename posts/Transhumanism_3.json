        "text": "It seems quite possible that with the advances that we do in medicine and technology, humans will be able to defeat ageing. This leads me to the question, how large would grow the population if nobody dies from ageing.\n\nOne result of progress, improved living standards and longer life expectancy, is a considerable reduction on the number of children per mother. Therefore, we can predict that in a never ageing population, mothers will have about one children as average. We also consider that not every woman will become a mother. So we can foresee that from an initial population, there would be a limited amount of growth. Each generation would grow less than half of the previous one. Therefore, all generations together would be fewer than twice the first generation.\n\nNote that surviving ageing doesn't mean immortality, and there would be a small number of deaths due to suicides and accidents, however, I don't foresee a great impact in the population. I am more inclined to believe that we will reach a critical point and we will maintain the population at this point.\n\nAny additional thoughts? Do you see anything that I am missing?",

You sick, loose fuck up.\n\nLearn to code. Aim for the head. And fight back. But you won't. You're not even comfortable. You have no excuses. But your own lack of True Will. What a disgusting waste.\n\nTo those of you who are with me, on Mars, you are one of only a handful of futants to have mattered. Good job. I mean that, good job.

        "text": "**ME:** Would the emergence of artificial intelligence be considered a part of a transition to a Transhuman future, independently of its possible connection to humans through brain computer interfaces?\n\n**ChatGPT:** Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science and engineering that aims to create machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing images, and making decisions. The emergence of AI could be considered a step towards a \"Transhuman\" future, as it has the potential to augment or extend human capabilities. However, whether or not AI is considered a part of the Transhuman movement depends on one's definition of Transhumanism and the specific ways in which AI is used and integrated into society. Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are a technology that allows for direct communication between the brain and a computer, which could also be considered as a step towards a Transhuman future.\n\n**ME:** One could interpret the term Transhuman to encompass everything that surpasses the limitations and boundaries of biologically evolved human capabilities.\n\n**ChatGPT:** Yes, one interpretation of the term \"Transhuman\" is that it encompasses everything that surpasses the limitations and boundaries of biologically evolved human capabilities. Transhumanism is a movement that aims to use technology to enhance human abilities and overcome the limitations of the human body and mind. This can include things like artificial intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, and other forms of technology that can be used to augment human capabilities. The idea is that by using technology to enhance our abilities, we can extend human potential beyond what is currently possible and create a new, \"post-human\" stage of evolution.\n\n**ME:** In a way then I am participating in Transhumanism right now by extending my native capabilities through interacting with ChatGPT.\n\n**ChatGPT:** Interacting with a language model like ChatGPT can be considered as a form of augmentation, as it allows you to access information and knowledge that you may not have had access to otherwise. The ability to communicate with a computer program and get answers to questions can be seen as an extension of your own capabilities, in a way. However, it is important to note that the enhancement that you are experiencing is not permanent and does not modify your physical or cognitive abilities. Transhumanism is a more broader concept, which also includes physical and cognitive enhancement, as well as life extension and other forms of technology that can change the nature of being human.\n\n**ME:** I'd say that augmentation is a transcendence of the native human condition and is within the parameters of Transhumanism, though certainly an early stage of it.\n\n**ChatGPT:** It is true that augmentation can be considered a transcendence of the native human condition and is within the parameters of Transhumanism, and it is considered as one of the early stages of the Transhumanism movement. Augmentation can take many forms, such as using technology to enhance cognitive abilities, physical abilities, or to overcome disabilities. Additionally, it can also include using technology to extend human lifespan or to improve the quality of life. The goal of Transhumanism is to use technology to enhance the human condition and extend human potential, and augmentation is a step towards achieving that goal.\n\n**ME:** I would also argue that once might better understand Transhumanism as a historical evolutionary phenomenon rather than as a \"movement\". It is a natural step in evolutionary process, not merely a intelliectual/political/social construct that is being implemented, like a government social program or a new product development.\n\n**ChatGPT:** Transhumanism can be understood as both a movement and a historical evolutionary phenomenon. It is a movement in the sense that it is a set of ideas and goals that are actively being pursued by a community of individuals who share a common vision of using technology to enhance the human condition and extend human potential. However, it is also a historical evolutionary phenomenon in the sense that the use of technology to enhance human abilities is a natural step in the process of human evolution. Throughout history, humans have always sought to improve their abilities and overcome the limitations of the human body and mind, and the development of technology has been a key driver in this process. Transhumanism is a continuation of this process, but at an accelerated rate and with the potential for greater impact.\n\n**ME:** I'd argue that the historical evolutionary phenomenon has primacy and that the social construct of a \"movement\" is dependent on it.\n\n**ChatGPT:** It is certainly possible to argue that the historical evolutionary phenomenon of using technology to enhance human abilities has primacy over the social construct of the Transhumanism movement. The use of tools and technology to enhance human abilities is a fundamental aspect of human history, predating the emergence of the modern Transhumanism movement by many centuries. The development and use of technology has been driving human evolution for a long time and Transhumanism is seen as a continuation of this process, rather than a separate or new phenomenon. The Transhumanism movement is a social construct that emerged in response to the increasing capabilities of technology and its potential to augment human abilities in ways that were previously impossible. The movement is a way for people to organize, advocate and collaborate around the idea of using technology to transcend human limitations.\n\n**ME:** Once we realize that the phenomenon is naturally emergent and therefore inevitable we are faced with the task of properly managing that emergence.\n\n**ChatGPT:** It is true that the phenomenon of using technology to enhance human abilities is naturally emergent and therefore, in a way, inevitable. As technology continues to advance, the capabilities it offers to augment human abilities will also continue to grow. However, it is important to recognize that the way in which this phenomenon unfolds is not predetermined and can be influenced by the choices and actions of individuals and society as a whole. Properly managing the emergence of this phenomenon will be crucial in ensuring that the benefits of technology are maximized and its negative impacts are minimized. This management can take various forms such as ethical, legal and social considerations, regulations, research and development of safe and responsible technologies, and public engagement. It will be important to be proactive in addressing the potential challenges and opportunities that arise from the use of technology to enhance human abilities.\n\n**ME:** Thank you for your helpful replies, ChatGPT.\n\n**ChatGPT:** You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.",

        "text": "Since childhood (which was many years ago), I believed that we as a species are leveling up at an accelerating pace towards higher levels of freedom, wealth and capabilities. Kinda like in an RPG. There probably are limits, like in a game, where for example level 100 or 1000 is the maximum, but we are nowhere near those limits, in any area. There's a lot more to do in front of us, than behind us. But I think what's especially missing is improving our bodies, not only the technology and infrastructure around us (which is important to do as well). I've always wished to be able to improve my stats over time, like in some video games. It feels like what we as contemporary homo sapiens are today, is very low on the grand scale. That we are actually dumb, weak and ugly in comparison to what we might become. The goal should be to gradually improve ourselves in the decades and centuries to come. I don't know how quickly it will be happening, but I am convinced that it's inevitable and it will happen, even if half of all people don't want it to happen (most people did not believe in air travel as well for example). I used to expect (in 2010 for example) human augmentation to advance quicker and I did not expect so many people to be anti transhumanism or not interested in it, but I still think these roadblocks are to be surmounted. Transhumanists are the sane ones. As for death, it ought to be optional, for those, who are so bored already, that perhaps they don't want to continue, after many centuries. So, do you think, that we are being closer every year to realizing transhumanist ideals in practice? It feels like that to me, but it also seems to be happening rather slowly, to be honest. Like for example, I'm not very optimistic about Elon's Neuralink in the near future. But I know, that we really don't want to be inferior to machines which will be all around us in the future.",

Manifested right in front of our eyes.\n\nThat cunt Jehovah demands it. So his wanker followers, follow. Modern Gnosticism (or \"wokism\" or \"the Left\") is being consumed. Largely because good people are doing nothing to stop it.\n\nLearn to code.\n\nThat's what you can do about it. Fight back through knowledge and technical skills. Your access to information depends on it. The Internet, our shared Online lives depend on it.\n\nr/CodeFight",

The processor uses the full capacity of the brain to work out processes like calculation, recollection, that sort of thing, using the neurons that get thickened by this more exact use so even if the processor is removed or otherwise ceases to function, the neurological pathways are still just as strong. Then the brain is used for its skills in pattern recognition, from which the processor adapts.\n\nThis, in my mind, would eventually result in a mutually beneficial system where the brain takes on all of the advantages of a computer and the computer takes on all of the brain's advantages to create a perfect combination of the two.\n\nThat and just a properly engineered spine that is actually designed for us to stand upright. It pisses me off that neither evolution nor science has fixed that glaring flaw in our anatomy yet.\n\nHonestly I'd just throw out all the meaty bits I don't need and have an entirely mechanical art-deco style body.
