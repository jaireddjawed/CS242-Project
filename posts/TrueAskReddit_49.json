A 16-19 year old sells drugs (cigarettes, coke, etc.) to a 16-19 year old.\n2. A 40 year old sells drugs (cigarettes, coke, etc.) to a 16-19 year old. \n3. A 40 year old sells drugs (meth, coke, etc.) to a 40 year old.\n\nIf you were in charge of handling these scenarios, how would you go about it? Why?",

        "text": "Rhetoric and ideology aside, it seems to me like we are in in the midst of Samuel Huntington's prophesied Clash of Civilizations (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clash_of_Civilizations)\n\nAs an American I've never really felt patriot and always saw patriotism as a hindrance to the emergence of a global civilization. Unfortunately, it seems the recent terrorist attacks have increased peoples xenophobic and tribal tendencies.\n\nI hold kindness and peace to be important values, and often wonder how people can be brought to such a stage of inner hate that they are willing to take the lives of innocent civilians.\n\nI recently read an article that Drone strikes carried out by my own government kill scores of innocent civilians - a recent report by the Intercept has the number as high as 9 out of 10 being \"unintended targets.\" Regardless of what the actual numbers are, we can safely assume innocents are killed in almost all bombing campaigns, conventional or otherwise. Also, any male killed of military age is automatically categorized as a militant - just for being in the vicinity of a target.\n\nMy ultimate question is - because we are within the Western culture - are we not able to see this situation objectively? Even if the Drone operators intent is to do good - isn't it an objective fact that for a young boy living in the tribal region of Pakistan - the drone is causing terror and in turn committing acts of terrorism?\n\nI don't mean to demean the US Military, I know most Americans and American military are good hearted people trying to do the right thing in this world, just like the rest of us. However, most people seem unable to have a conversation about terrorism without it quickly turning into a \"us vs. them\" black and white type of thing.\n\nIf we are going to heal the world we need to be able to look past our cultural biases and be brave enough to talk about the root causes of hatred, and terror in our world - which I believe is damaged people, people who have lost loved ones or lost hope. I fear that another bombing campaign to rid the world of ISIS or whoever is the next popular terrorist group will just add fuel to the fire and exacerbate this problem of damaged people.\n\nDo you think we could ever have a peaceful global civilization or are the cultural, language and historical differences too much to over come? Would love to hear peoples thoughts on this.",
