When I pull the crown out, it feels loose and turning it does nothing. Have I just ruined my first mechanical watch? \n\nThe watch also seems to stop running randomly (every 30 minutes to 1 hour ish), however giving it a little shake gets it going again. \n\nIf I leave the watch running for long enough, I can feel some resistance when turning crown after it pulling it out. This lets me do some adjusting of the time, however it is inconsistent and makes the hands \"jump\".\n\nThanks for any help, I am rather new to watches.",
