        "text": "Hey all, I’m in the market for a new pour over brewer and thought I’d get your thoughts before settling on one. \n\nFor reference, I currently have a V60, Kalita Wave, Chemex, Aeropress and Bonavita drip maker. \n\nI’m specifically looking for the best pour over brewer that can make anywhere from 2-4 cups (cup being about 10oz). For right now, I usually make 2 cups each morning and take it to work with me in a thermos. However, some times I make 4 and take 2 with me and leave 2 for my wife. That’s rare, but it happens. So a brewer with that flexibility without changing the recipe too much is ideal. \n\nMy main thought now is the Hario Switch. I like the idea of having full immersion brewing but still getting the clarity from a filter brew. But I’m definitely open to alternatives. I’d appreciate any thoughts.",

Even cold brew I steep for days that has a very high caffeine content, I can drink it all day with no issue, but a double shot of espresso just wreaks havoc.  My girlfriend has noticed this as well.\n\nI guess the question is, are there components that are extracted when brewing coffee hot coffee that are not when brewing cold brew that might explain this increase in anxiety?  I always assumed it was the caffeine but I recently came to realize after having drank mostly cold brew in the past week that this may not be the case.",

        "text": " \n\nMongolia is a land of breathtaking beauty and diversity, with a plethora of natural wonders and cultural treasures that make it an enthralling travel destination. The rugged terrain of the country includes snow-capped mountains, sweeping grasslands, sparkling lakes, and the legendary Gobi Desert, which is home to a variety of rare wildlife.\n\nThe [beauty of Mongolia ](https://juulchin.com/tour-list/beauty-of-mongolia-tours)extends beyond its natural landscapes to its rich cultural heritage, as reflected in its traditional arts, music, dance, and festivals. The country is also known for its distinct nomadic lifestyle, with visitors able to stay in traditional felt tents, ride horses, and participate in the ancient art of eagle hunting.\n\nThe contrast between Mongolia's vast open spaces and the bustling energy of its capital city, Ulaanbaatar, is one of its most striking features. Visitors can immerse themselves in modern Mongolian culture here, where there is a thriving arts scene, diverse cuisine, and a vibrant nightlife.\n\nMongolia offers a wealth of experiences for travelers seeking adventure, culture, and natural beauty, whether exploring the rugged beauty of Mongolia's countryside or the lively energy of the city. Its distinct combination of ancient traditions and modern vitality makes it a truly unforgettable destination.\n\nMongolia is a land of breathtaking natural beauty and cultural riches. Its vast landscapes are dotted with snow-capped mountains, rolling hills, vast grasslands, and winding rivers, all of which provide an awe-inspiring backdrop to its distinctive way of life.\n\nThe Gobi Desert, which stretches across the southern part of the country and is home to some of the world's most stunning sand dunes, rock formations, and wildlife, is one of Mongolia's most notable natural features.\n\nMongolia, in addition to its natural beauty, has a rich cultural heritage that is reflected in its traditions, festivals, and architecture. The country's nomadic lifestyle is still very much alive, and visitors can experience it by staying in traditional felt tents called gers and participating in activities like horseback riding and eagle hunting.\n\nMongolians are also known for their warm hospitality and welcoming spirit, which contributes to the country's overall charm. Mongolia is a destination that offers a unique and unforgettable travel experience, from the bustling capital city of Ulaanbaatar to the remote countryside, and its beauty is truly one-of-a-kind.\n\n**Top 3 Winter Mongolian Adventure Tour Holidays**\n\nIf you are looking for [winter mongolia](https://juulchin.com/tour-list/winter-tours) adventure holidays the options are pretty broad - from dog sledding and ice hotels to skiing and wildlife. Here and my top 10 winter adventure holidays:\n\n1**. Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) in Norway**. This is my number one because it is something everyone should see, it is a great trip for families (I have a new daughter, so this has suddenly become important! ), and it is simple enough for even the most inexperienced adventurers. If you've never heard of them, they're a natural light show that appears in the sky over the polar regions.\n\nI won't get into the science (see wikipedia! ), but the result is an incredible display of colors across the sky. The best months to visit are September and October, as well as March and April. There is no guarantee that you will see them, but if you speak with your hotel staff or tour operator, they frequently run a text service that will notify you when they appear.\n\n2. **Husky Wilderness Safari in Quebec** \\- If, like me, you've always wanted to meet Husky dogs, there's no better place to do so than in Quebec's true wilderness. Frozen lakes, vast rivers, and snow-covered forests provide the ideal setting for a spectacular winter Mongolia adventure vacation.\n\n3. **Mongolia Winter Festivals** \\- For the more experienced adventurers, how about a truly unique winter adventure holiday in Mongolia? The best months to visit are February and March, which coincide with several local festivals, including the massive Tsagaan Sar (Mongolian Lunar New Year Celebration), the Ice Festival on northern Lake Huvsgul, and the 1000 Camels Festival in the Gobi Desert. This is truly off the beaten path; few tourists make it here, so you can expect a very intimate, local experience. Plan ahead of time for this one!\n\nI hope you enjoyed my top three winter adventure vacations. Please keep in mind that trips 2 and 3 are not suitable for solo travel (unless you are very experienced). You should find one of the many excellent tour operators who can assist you in making them a reality. Try Juulchin.com, where we've compiled a list of the best winter adventure vacations.",

        "text": "Hello. In short, I need help to **justify my next purchase for coffee stuffs** that might seem a little too much for those who don't appreciate coffee.\n\nLet me elaborate by telling about myself. I'm a 30+ man from south east asia. So far I have been into countless hobbies, which i've spent considerable amount of money, effort, and time either learning or socializing. I'm living with my partner. We do care about each other, that's why she don't want me to recklessly spend tons of resource for something i wouldnt care much about in just several years or even months. And i do agree with her, as im getting older i cant just spend my life on something i only like just for a while.\n\nAs for coffee, i'm pretty sure i won't get into the rabbit hole. Coffee would never be a hobby to me. It's just something basic that i like. Almost like basic necessity. If i must compare, perhaps coffee is like shoes, or TV. I don't need to delve in it or have the best thing like $2,000 shoes for every occassion or 100\" OLED 144Hz TV. Having decent thing that works should be enough for me. I just recently figured out how good coffee could be, and would love to be able to drink coffee the next time i wan't it. Seems not too much right?\n\nHere are the list of next purchase that i thought are basic and humble enough to be in my kitchen for years ahead:  \n\\- basic aeropress. we could bring them along when traveling or hiking. not taking a lot of space. unbreakable and lightweight. i could buy them for around 40 USD here but i guess i have to wait until my birthday since she might not know what else to get me as present cause i already have everything i want. i've also looked at aeropress accessories, and seems nothing caught my heart yet.  \n\\- basic stove top gooseneck kettle around 3-8 USD. that's bottom cheap and irreplacable for making decent coffee right?  \n\\- timemore C2 at 37 USD. i'm not even going for the C3 or other better grinder. i thought if i'm going to brew for the rest of my life, then i might as well buy a hand grinder that supports sensible grind adjustment, decent enough grind uniformity, could last for years, and replacable burr. still more practical than table top electric grinder i suppose.  \n\\- cheap coffee scale under 10 USD. i'm familiar with kitchen scale, heck i love them and use them whenever i can. but whats annoying about making coffee on my kitchen scale is that sometimes they dont register changes when i pour beans, and sometimes they turn off by themselves. i am bless with great memory and math logic, but for under 10 USD to serve me years of practicality im not asking for much right? coffee scale doesnt take much space either.\n\nIt might be just me, but as a guy who tends to get into taking up lots of hobbies i have a hunch that she could bring up my home brewing activities into later argument in despise. I got pre hipertension as well, from insomnia and vaping. I have thrown away lots of my belongings, as our place are somewhat cramped. Currently we only have stuffs that we use and hobbies stuffs that we're only currently into and are going to do for the rest of our lives. That's why i'm trying my best to not cram coffee stuffs into the kitchen, **keeping them the most basic and as small as possible**.\n\nNow as a beginner, I humbly ask for opinions regarding my next purchase for home brewing. Are there cheaper or smaller alternatives that's not priced somewhere beyond acceptance for non coffee lovers? How to reassure myself and my partner that these are basic enough, could last years, and not an insane purchase? For everyone responding or even just reading my plead here, i thank you very much.",
