[{"title":"On suicidal users","author":"BlatantConservative","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/wpewpv\/on_suicidal_users\/","text":"Due to the nature of this community, we get suicidal posts near daily. \n\nOur userbase has been extremely kind and gracious to these users, and I do think the kindness of this community has saved some lives. \n\nHowever, I've been dealing with suicidal users for about six years on this site, and it's gotten to the point that I feel like we need some guidelines for these threads. I'm going to start with a few things I've learned from experience, but I welcome feedback and anything the community can think of that can also become a guideline. \n\n1) There is no one-size-fits-all solution to suicide. If anything, robotic answers and a cookie cutter plan would convince a suicidal person that you don't actually care. \n\n\n2) You aren't going to logic someone out of a mindset they didn't logic themselves into. Suicide is inherently idiosyncratic and if you ask \"why\" or try to argue with them on the specifics, they're just going to repeat and reinforce the things that make them suicidal in the first place. You, hearing about this for the first time, cannot compete with them having repeated these things and thought about them every day for months. They will have an answer for every question, every bit of logic, almost anything you can say.  The answers won't necessarily be logically sound, but they will be very real to the person at the center of it all. It's like a court case, you're the defense and they're the prosecution, and you didn't even know you were a lawyer. There IS a defense (I've never run into any suicidal person that actually deserved to die, or had such a bad life as to give up on it) but you are not as prepared to find it as they are to argue against it. TL;DR, don't engage with them in an adversarial fashion. \n\n3) People are coming to the internet *because* they are nervous about talking about this in real life. Telling them to find real life resources is a good idea in some situations, but in others telling them to find a trusted friend, adult, doctor, teacher, therapist, etc, will backfire because they cannot bring themselves to talk face to face with someone.  However, in these cases, finding them resources to licensed professionals they can deal with, through a phone call or chat line, is something they'd be interested in, as long as it has no chance of intersecting with their real lives. \n\n4) This is considerably darker than the other ones, but if the person does fall into deeper despair and takes their own life, it is not your fault.  The metaphor I like to use is: there is someone who got into a car accident and ended up stuck in a car on a railroad crossing, and you see a train coming from half a mile away. You rush to the car and try to get the person, who is hurt and finds it hard to move, out of the car before the train hits it. If you get them out of the car and to safety, you still need to let professionals see the wounds, you're not going to solve the entire problem, just the one super dangerous part. If you *don't* get to the car in time and they get hit, it's not your fault, it's not their fault, it's not the train driver's fault.  I've seen several Reddit mods, over the years, develop their own serious mental health problems because of the suicidal users we have to deal with.  Just keep in mind that we're brave, kindly bystanders trying to help, we are not responsible for the whole situation. \n\n\nI also would like to compile a list of suicide help and chat\/phone call resources that we could send to people (if the situation is appropriate).  I would like as many as you can find for the US, but also Reddit is becoming more and more international and I am very very short on international resources, or country specific resources. \n\nI also need a list of things I should exclude from the automod filters filtering out links. \n\n988 - US national suicide hotline number - note, this number is potentially going to cause a police and EMT response, which might be traumatic for someone who lives with family or otherwise would be traumatized. Think carefully, it's an amazing resource but it might also cause problems. \n\nConversely, 988 is not exclusive to suicidal people themselves, it is also a resource for people who want help with friends or family.  You do not have to be the suicidal person yourself to call.\n\n988lifeline.org - website for the same, with more resources\n\nhttps:\/\/blog.opencounseling.com\/suicide-hotlines\/ - up to date suicide hotlines internationally\n\nhttps:\/\/bridgestonetires.com.ph\/list-of-organizations-offering-free-counseling-online\/ - Bizarre Bridgestone Tires list of mental health resources in the Philippines, which has helped me several times but I'm still amazed that the tire company is running this. I did buy Bridgestone the last time I got tires.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1660607546.0},{"title":"SUCCESS SUNDAYS (September)","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11l9k9a\/success_sundays_september\/","text":"&#x200B;\n\n1.

I'm sick of being undervalued.","author":"ChromeHomeworld","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11qbtg9\/i_want_to_be_productive_but_then_the_memories_of\/","text":"Hi all, I really want to be as productive as possible, to hone my skills and gain new ones, and to make as bright as possible a future for myself. And on some days, I can do that. I can go to work, come home and practice my art, and do dissertation work for my master's degree. But on most days, I can't do it. I have diagnosed clinical depression (currently unmedicated because the last time I was on antidepressants they made me worse and stopped me eating for weeks at a time, so I've been hesitant to use them), but I am seeing my doctor this coming Wednesday to discuss alternative antidepressants. This of course is naturally going to affect my motivation to do pretty much anything, but recently it's just been so much harder due to my long-term partner breaking up with me because I was \"hard to be around\", even though they never told me this until it happened. This emotionally and mentally crippled me, and still does to a large extent. And no matter what, when I try to engage in my hobbies, or do something productive outside of my job, the memories of them come back and stop me in my tracks. I look at what I'm doing and think \"what's the point?\" I know you're not supposed to make another person your whole world and the only thing that makes you happy for this very reason, but that was something that I learned was a mistake through hindsight. How worthless was I to them that I could be abandoned like that? I was so in love with them, and they made me so happy. Even if I do get into another relationship in the future, I don't think I could love again like that. Nothing brings me as much happiness as that relationship did - even the temporary moments of joy I get from my hobbies are nothing in comparison. And I just get reminded of this and it makes me freeze, and saps any motivation to go on doing things. \n\nThis feeling of loneliness extends to my friendships as well. I had to move away from the city that I went to university in, and away from all my friends, due to not having enough money to pay rent there for the time being. So I'm back living with my parents at age 23, completely alone with no friends in a remote town, which is something I desperately wanted to avoid. My partner and I were saving for a place together. But they left and now I'll have to save for a whole lot longer. \nOver messages and calls, my friends aren't the most talkative bunch in any case, and it's usually me initiating contact. Even my more talkative friends have recently wanted to \"take a break\" from talking to me (granted, for good personal reasons), but even then they're still very active on social media which makes me think it's just *me* they don't want to keep in regular contact with. I don't expect constant communication with people - we all have lives - but when they need to take breaks from me specifically, no matter the reason (and they do have good reasons tbf), it doesn't feel good. Which makes me feel unvalued and chips at my sense of worth. Which again makes me more stagnant and less likely to do productive things. Because what's the point if others can't see my worth? Humans are social creatures, so it seems only natural to get a sense of worth from others. There's only so much I can big myself up without it just seeming delusional. How do I stop feeling like this? I just want to be able to enjoy my life without worrying about how people see me, and without these memories of the relationship I lost ruining all my attempts at improvement.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678719107.0},{"title":"You\u2019d Be Surprised How People Perceive You","author":"WorryTimely231","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11qf0y3\/youd_be_surprised_how_people_perceive_you\/","text":"Hello guys, today I saw a video on YouTube by pursuit of wonder titled \" You\u2019d Be Surprised How People Perceive You\" ands after watching this video a small fun experiment came in my mind:  \n***Ask your friends how they see you and what they like or dislike about you in an anonymous form***\n\nI believe this could be a fun and important experiment in our life, we can generate a basic google form and ask our closest friends about how they feel about us,  \nDon't know whether it will help me or not , may be the only way is test this and see the result.

There were many times when I would make the mistake of hanging out with people who would make me feel judged or pissed off. It was my own fault because I didn't build my mind to be powerful nor did I love and value myself enough to walk away when it was never worth being there in the first place. The thing about connecting with other people is that we are essentially teaching them how to treat us by the way we act. If we are always jumping to conclusions or saying things without a purpose they're going to treat us as if we are not so sure of ourselves. You see, life is like a mirror. Whatever I put out is what Im going to get back. \n\nSo, I want to encourage everyone who reads this post to research and learn of ways to strengthen your mind and build it to be so powerful that these kind of people and situations that drain your self esteem naturally go away. Love and cherish who you are because there is always someone out there who accepts you for who you are inside and out. Once you fix your inner world your outer world will fix as well it may need time to catch up though, so just try to be patient. That means that you might have to quit certain habits that make you weaker physically and mentally. It may also mean that you might have to stop hanging out with certain people as well. Change is not easy, but I can reassure you that it is the enst choice I have ever made. I would rather choose to be alone than to lower my standards for others.

This has had such a positive impact on my overall mood, mental health, physical health and cognitive functions.\n\nThe techniques I used are as follows:\n\n1. **Initial Struggle** \\- there will be an initial period of struggle when you attempt to wake up early. This is akin to a bird flying - in order to enter flight mode it must flap it's wings aggressively and only then will it float through the sky - similarly you have to utilise excessive willpower and energy in the primary phase of this change in order to be able to maintain this habit moving forward.\n2. **Exposure to Sunlight** \\- early morning sunlight is critical to aligning the body clock and molecular machinery for a consistent sleeping routine. The sun rays at sunrise will trigger your body to set it's sleep schedule for 16-18 hours later and thus you will feel energised and tired at appropriate times during the day.\n3. **Exercise in the Morning** \\- in order to wake your body up optimally, your core body temperature should be higher during periods of wakefulness and lower during periods of sleep. So, to piggyback on this biological mechanism, we can work to raise our core body temperature through exercise. Personally, I walk in the mornings in order to achieve the elevated heart rate and body temperature and this allows me to prepare mentally for the day ahead as well as improve my mood, mental and physical health.\n4. **Caffeine** \\- I limit my caffeine intake to prior to 12pm; no caffeine after. Also delaying caffeine for 60-90 minutes upon waking helps to clear out the caffeine from the previous day and start afresh with your adenosine receptors; maximising the effects of the caffeine and eliminating the afternoon crash most people experience at lunchtime.\n5. **Stop working by 5\/6pm** \\- I turn off all cognitively demanding tasks by 5\/6pm and enter relaxation mode; switching from a dopamine driven system to a serotonin based system - achieved by relaxing, eating and doing other leisurely tasks in order to wind down physically and mentally before bed.\n6. **Eat a Carbohydrate-rich meal 2-3 hours before bed** \\- Eating a high carb meal 2-3 hours prior to sleeping has several benefits; firstly, the high carbohydrate meal will cause an increase in serotonin in your bloodstream, which is associated with relaxation and contentment and satiety. This will help you wind down physiologically and get you relaxed before you sleep. Secondly, by stopping eating 2-3 hours before bed, you ensure your digestive process does not interfere with your sleep cycle or schedule. If you eat too close to bed you will wake up feeling groggy, and will require more sleep and will struggle to wake up the next morning.\n7. **A warm shower within an hour of sleep** \\- a warm shower will lower your core body temperature, relax your muscles and signal to your body that it is time to relax. It helps you to get ready for bed both physically and mentally.\n8. **No lights an hour before bed** \\- I switch off my phone and put it away an hour before bed; to do so, I reply to all conversations, turn my alarm on and enter Do Not Disturb mode an hour before I sleep.\n9. **Mindfulness before sleep** \\- I spend 30-60 minutes in a dark room praying (I'm a Muslim so I pray the night prayer), alternatively, you could engage in any spiritual or mindful practise. During this time I also prepare myself mentally for the next day by planning ahead and this has a positive effect in that it excites and energises you when you wake up in the morning because you have already visualised and planned the day the night before.\n10. **Failure** \\- I have had days and periods of time where life has gotten in the way and I have had to sleep later and this may cause me to wake up later - but I have had to use strong willpower and discipline in order to not allow one or two days to interrupt my schedule and prevent me from having my routine being set.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678726179.0},{"title":"I\u2019m depressed.

My grades went down. My head filled with suicidal thoughts. I spend my day doing destructive activities to forget the pain of existence. Gaming, Porn, Cigarettes and lately even started drinking. It was only when I started drinking I realized how bad the path I am on is. I fear I am going to be a jobless bum in the future. \n\nWhen the Lockdown started, I had only recently started college, I had fucked up High school but somehow got into a mediocre college in a program I was interested in, It was the lowest point in my whole 20 years of existence, I was the most suicidal, I spent 3 months in a vegetative state barely eating and watching anime and playing games for hours in a day. But once I enrolled in a college My wasted years of high school acted as fuel for me to change myself and I did. I studied hard, exercised and lost 34 kilograms of weight (I weighed 132 and was fat all my life, got bullied for it as long as I can remember) but things again started going bad after mid 2022. Suicidal once again, got diagnosed with depression and currently on anti depressants which do not seem to help me. I realized it is my bad lifestyle and especially my bad thought patterns.\n\nI did not the see the point in living, felt so insignificant like how the death of a single ant in an ant colony wouldn't make any difference and that's how I felt about me in relation with society. Used to slit my wrists and choke myself in anger but thankfully stopped doing that but this pain still doesn't go away\n\nI know my potential and the things I can achieve yet I lack discipline and the will to actually get my life together. I gained back 5 kgs too and stopped exercising seriously and the Cigarettes are the worst. They make me feel the most bad about myself, I hate them yet I smoke them. I feel bad as I am in the act of smoking them but I can't stop myself.\n\nI don't know what I hope to achieve here but I wanted to vent. I lost all the good habits I had built, Journaling, Reading, Exercising, Studying and went back to the shit hole.

However, the environment at home is quite toxic and I have been forcing myself to endure it over the last year for those savings \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3.\n\nI told myself in 2023 I would move out and get my own place here, however, it is quite an expensive area, there are no houseshares available, I can't move in with any friends, and my only option would be to rent a small 1 bed flat. I have found one available with a 6 month contract. This is appealing to me, as I think I might go travelling in the winter, however in the meantime I am in a dilemma.\n\nRenting would be expensive, and even on my decent salary, it would take up about 40% of my income with bills. It feels like a pointless waste of money as I will be staying in the same town, however the toxic environment at home is starting to effect my job and mental health.\n\nOur house is very small and my family is large, and one of my parents has significant mental issues.\n\nFor instance, I frequently get woken up early in the morning by one of my parents playing musical instruments. Usually, I don't mind this sort of thing, however, when my job requires focus and good quality sleep, this is an issue. I have started making mistakes at work due to poor sleep and focus.\n\nWhen confronted, they promise to stop, but then keep doing it again, saying that its for their mental health and the only time they can practice playing is before work. This shows to me that they don't actually care about my work environment and I can't take their promises seriously.\n\nThere is often a lot of daytime noise also, often right outside my bedroom door. Again my pleas for quiet go ignored. Sometimes I will go out to work at a cafe\/library, however I'm getting fed up of the lack of consistency and feel like I need a proper home office where I can work undisturbed.\n\nThey also don't seem to understand that despite working remotely, I need consistency to be productive. I tell them that I plan to take my lunch break at a fixed time, however, when I go downstairs to make lunch I am met with huffing and moaning as someone else will often want to use our small kitchen at the same time as me or they'll have \"just cleaned up\" etc. I am also expected to help out with jobs around the house during my working hours sometimes.\n\nI'm sure these are common issues for people living with parents, however, it is making my life feel very chaotic and my productivity is in shambles. I feel like my complaints aren't taken seriously and they don't understand why I can't \"just get on with it\".\n\nI don't feel like I should need to fork out over 1000 a month just to have a quiet work environment in the same town as I already live, yet the thought of enduring this for another 6 months is not very fun.\n\nHowever, I also think about what that money could be better spent on instead of rent (ie. driving lessons, holidays, more savings etc). I don't want to move to a cheaper area just yet, so it's between staying at home or moving to this 1 bed flat down the road, for now.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678724385.0},{"title":"Unf*ck Yourself, book recomm3ndation!","author":"whatisthematterwith","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11qdn8o\/unfck_yourself_book_recomm3ndation\/","text":"I hope that that 3 fished you in and that you came on here. \ud83d\ude4f\n\nI just read Unf*ck Yourself by Gary John Bishop on Blinkist (that\u2019s reading for people who have kids), and just came on here to recommend it to you.

Unfortunately, many don't realize how much better their lives would be as a result of being self-reliant.\n\nHere are 5 reasons you must become self-reliant:\n\n**#1: You experience personal growth.** When you become self-reliant, you take control of your life. You are able to make decisions that line up with your values and goals. This opens you up to seeking new experiences, and taking bigger, more calculated risks.  It also hones your mind, helping you learn better from mistakes.\n\n**#2: You become resilient.** When you become self-reliant, you're better equipped to adapt to changing circumstances. You're able to 'reset' after taking a loss. You can better overcome challenges and obstacles in your way.\n\n**#3: You become independent.** When you become self-reliant, you stop looking to others for approval or validation. You can appreciate the progress you've made all by yourself.\n\n**#4: You become self-aware.** We tend to not look inside enough to know our strengths, weaknesses, and limitations. This highlights areas for improvement and forces you to up your game to achieve your goals.\n\n**#5: You build confidence.** Nothing makes you feel better than developing a sense of competence. Being competent opens up more opportunities. When you can show real skill and ability, it leads to recognition and new possibilities.\n\nDo the work.

The reason I started looking into the things that I will talk about in this guide is that I have been suffering with mental health issues such as depression and anxiety for at least the last five years and it only got worse over time. I was prescribed antidepressants early in January 2022, after looking into it I decided that if it can be avoided I don't want to take antidepressants. After this and in combination with me basically just waiting for my depression to go away and not doing anything about it I decided I needed to find a way to solve my mental health problems by changing my lifestyle and implementing new practices. By no means am I consistent with all of the routine that I have created for myself, and I have dropped it completely at times, but with all that said I have succeeded in drastically improving my mental health and as a byproduct my lifestyle. I understand that there is no one size fits all approach to this and that solving the same problem for different people can need 2 completely different solutions, so I have tried my best to include many different options within the larger framework of this guide in the hope that it will benefit the most people that it can. The parts of this guide that are strongly recommended are based on 2 things: the impact the practice had on myself, and the things that work at a biological level meaning as long as you are human or in some cases just a mammal they will work to benefit you. I truly hope that all those who want this type of guide find something valuable here, something that will improve your day to day as these practices have for me. If anyone wishes to look for practices or advice outside of this guide (which I would recommend because I don\u2019t know everything or you personally) I have included links to places which I have gotten most of the information from that allowed me to create this guide.\n\nStep 0\n\nStarting point \n\nLow point\/rock bottom\n\nLots of bad habits\n\nDirectionless\n\nWar between what you want to do and what you feel like doing\n\nPoor Mental Health \n\nStep 1 Recognise where you are and where you want to be\n\nWrite about your current state:\n\nwhat is life like \n\nwhat are you failing at by your own definition\n\nWhat are you succeeding at by your own definition\n\nwhat does your typical day look like\n\nWrite about what you want and why you want it:\n\nWhat could you do more of\n\nWhat could you do less of \n\nWhat do you want your typical day to look like\n\nWhat do you want to work towards\/achieve\n\nWrite about what will happen if you don't change and why:\n\nWhere will your bad habits lead you\n\nWhat will happen to your mental health\n\nWhat will happen to your physical health\n\nHow will your finances be effected \n\nHow will your relationships be affected\n\nIt is important to take the time to write about these things and not just think about them, writing will allow you to build a clearer, and bigger, picture of the situation than you can achieve by just thinking about it. Having this written down will also allow you to revisit it in the future and reflect on your progress which will be useful in step 2. It is important that when writing the answers to those prompts that you do it by your own definition so you can build a picture of how you feel within yourself and to take it further why that's the case. The first part of the writing is to figure out where you are so we have a solid and defined starting point to work from, the last part is to build a picture of what will happen if nothing changes or things get worse. This is important, it is one thing to have something to run towards but much more motivating is something to run away from, having both is ideal which is one of the things we are trying to create with the writing process.\n\nStep 2 Game plan\n\nNow you have a list of things you want to add into your life with an explanation of why making those changes will be good for you, and a list of things to avoid and why those things will be bad for you. Now you must come up with a plan of action to start making these changes, to start with we will create a daily routine.\n\nWhen it comes to making your routine there are somethings you need to know:\n\nA routine is not meant to be a rigid set of rules that mean you have to do x then y and you get no time for yourself\n\nYour routine will be changed over time, some things will work and others won't, and so over time parts of your routine will change but you have to try these things before you know what needs to be changed \n\nSome things can't be done without first doing something else (for example getting up at 5 can\u2019t be done consistently over night, you start at 8 then 7 30, then 7\u2026)  you must start at the bottom if you want to improve\n\nConsistency is key but will also come with time, some things will take longer to be consistent with than others so you need to start small and then build up\n\nA good starting point for your daily routine is to take some time to imagine or even better write about your perfect day, that will be the basis for your routine and of course you won\u2019t be able to achieve this perfect day over night but if you can get 1% of your perfect day tomorrow then the next day you can get 2% and so on. When we look at it in terms of numbers this might seem like a small change but 1% is a huge jump from 0% and by your own definition that is 1% of the way towards your perfect day. In my experience a \u201cbad\u201d day with 1% perfect is a game changer as I started to see progress, I started to see that my perfect day was actually something I could achieve. That is an important part of the mindset you need to go into this with, you need to think to yourself \u201c1 is infinitely more than 0\u201d instead of \u201c1 is so far away from 100 I might as well give up\u201d because if you follow the thinking in the latter quote you will never go from 1 to 2, you will never allow yourself to find out how much progress you could make, who you could become, what kind of life you could build for yourself, all those things will be killed by that mindset before you even get started with them.  \n\nThings to include and how to structure it:\n\nSleep Schedule\n\nYou must include a consistent wake up and bed time, it does not matter what times you pick only that you become consistent, this is because an unstable sleep schedule will disrupt your bodies internal clock (circadian rhythm), this clock regulates your mood and many other things, mood is key however as the worse your mood is the less likely you\u2019ll want to do the rest of your routine. To make getting into a consistent sleep schedule easier once you wake up you can: go outside for a few minutes when the sun is up, do something to get your heart rate up, do some form of cold exposure (for example cold shower or standing outside with minimal clothing for a few minutes). Getting sunlight is one of the indicators the body uses to figure out what time of day it is and so is great for anchoring the internal clock, getting your heart rate up and cold exposure will raise your core body temperature which will make you feel more awake as during sleep our core body temperature is at its lowest. The other part of having a consistent sleep schedule is having a consistent evening schedule which essentially boils down to going to bed at the same time each night. It is important to remember that time in bed does not mean time asleep so lets say you want to get up at 6 am and want to get 8 hours of sleep, to get those 8 hours you need to be asleep by 10pm so you would want to be in bed at around 9:30pm to make sure you get those 8 hours of sleep. I would also recommend that you don't have any screen time for around 1 hour before you go the bed and use a blue light filter on your devices 2-3 hours before you go to bed all of this helps to tell the body that it is getting close to bedtime and will make it easier to fall asleep and improve the quality of your sleep. An easy way to limit your screen time before bed that I have found useful is to read a book for that hour before you go to bed, if reading isn't for you then you might not have found the right book\/type of book yet, a good way to find a book you might like is to look for books on topics you\u2019re interested in, if you are just starting reading I found it helpful to start with a fictional book to get me into the habit. If you\u2019ve never had a consistent sleep schedule then you will have never felt the benefits of having one which include, it being easier to get out of bed in the morning, improved mood, reduced stress, better quality sleep, more energy, and having loads of the biological processes in our body working better such as metabolism and the cardiovascular (heart and blood) system.\n\nProgress Tracking\n\nAdd in a form of progress tracking, personally I recommend you use a small notebook in which you would write the date, the things you have and have not done and mark completion with a done or not done, personally I write Victory for completing tasks and Defeat for not completing task but for this guide we\u2019ll simplify it to a tick or a cross (for example get up at 7 tick, meditate tick, workout cross). This will serve six important functions,  firstly it will give you a log to look back on and allow you to see your progress which is especially useful once you\u2019ve been keeping it up for a little while as on days where you feel you have failed you can look back and see that you have in fact done much more than you did on the first few days despite the fact that you have done less than yesterday. The second thing this will do is keep you accountable on days where you might not feel like doing x or y as you\u2019ll then have to write i failed x and on most occasions I have found that I decided to just do x as you are almost forced to see that it is your choice if you tick or cross x. The third benefit will also help you to get to grips with your routine as each day you\u2019ll be making a list of the things you\u2019ve done and get you used to the idea of I\u2019ve just got up, I will now do x then y and so on. Fourthly this will allow you to more easily see the parts of your routine that are problematic and allow you to tweak those things to make them a better fit to your routine or replace them with something else. Tracking your progress will also make it so you are bringing positive events to mind on a daily basis, every time you tick an action or a goal you are reminding yourself that I did good today even if you have 5 crosses and 1 tick on a day you still bring that one positive to mind and by ticking it you are saying \u201cI did good at x today\u201d. This point works together with the gratitude practice especially if you are suffering with depression or low mood, sticking with the example of 5 crosses and 1 tick you can then write in your gratitude journal \u201cI am grateful for the action I completed\u201d and overall makes the positives stand out more than they normally would. Finally by keeping track on a daily basis you can very easily start to spot the warning signs that you\u2019re slipping out of your routine,  such as you slept in 2 days in a row and now you don\u2019t feel like continuing your morning routine, or you didn\u2019t track your progress yesterday so you open your book and find that you have missed nearly a week of progress tracking not just one day. At least those are some of the things I look for to tell me if I'm slipping out of my routine, yours might be different but having a daily record will help you to spot these patterns. Routines and habits are reliant on momentum, the longer you have been doing something the easier it is to continue this works both ways however, the longer you\u2019ve been off your routine the harder it can be to get back into it. The solution here is to spot the loss of positive momentum and\/or the gain of negative momentum as soon as possible so that you can intervene before the problem gets bigger.\n\nScheduling Tips\n\nSchedule the things you least feel like doing in the morning and in order of resistance, I am not suggesting that you should get up and do those things immediately as you may feel like not getting out of bed if the first thing you are faced with is the hardest thing for you to do. Doing the things you don't want to do in the morning and in order of not wanting to do them will mean that everything after them will be easier comparatively and also stops them from looming over you any longer than necessary we all know what it\u2019s like to have a task we don't want to do so we keep putting it off and during the time we keep avoiding it it\u2019s always in the back of your mind or can be a cause of anxiety, so by doing them first we avoid that and you get to go through the rest of your day with a sense that you have already achieved something. To start with add in 1-3 high resistance activities but ones that you want to do and ones that you would do. \n\nI procrastinate\/feel the tasks I have set for myself are too much \n\nThis is a very common thing that we all go through at some point or another part of this is getting to know what we can and would actually do. The more you practice setting yourself tasks like in the routine that we are in the process of creating the better you will get to know your capabilities and tendencies. To figure out what you would and wouldn't do we can do a simple thought exercise let's say the task is to clean the house but that seems too much, okay am I willing to clean just my bedroom today, still no, okay am I willing to clean my desk, still no, okay am I willing to put the glass left over from yesterday in the dishwasher yes. Essentially you start with the task you want to get done and then break down the steps until they are small enough that you are willing to do them, sure it might take you longer to actually clean the house this way then if you did it all at once but in this example we know that the full task is too much for us at this moment and by doing this we have still made progress towards it that we wouldn\u2019t have if we didn\u2019t break it down.\n\nHow do reduce the resistance do doing the things in your routine\/things you want to start doing\n\nOnce you start your new routine it\u2019s very likely that it will require a lot of conscious effort on your part, you have to force yourself out of bed, force yourself to meditate, force yourself to do whatever it is and that is naturally quite draining. There are ways to make these things easier and you will have to play around with this yourself to see what does and doesn't work for you but the main idea is based around environment design. The idea here is that taking the path of least resistance ie staying in bed all morning is the easiest path to take so with environment design we try to make it easier to do the things we want to do, for example I play guitar and wanted to play more than once every week or so, one of the reasons I didn't play very often is I had to go to a different room, which I never go in unless im playing guitar. The simple act of moving my guitar into my bedroom and putting it next to my desk has meant that I pick it up multiple times a night because it\u2019s right there, I have minimized the things I need to do before I play guitar. Another example from my life that I think will be helpful is when I started trying to wake up earlier I would usually wake up and go on my phone, which I charged next to my bed overnight, and would always end up falling back to sleep. The change I made here was I started charging my phone in the kitchen near the coffee machine, so when I woke up I wanted to get my phone which meant I had to go downstairs, by which point I was pretty awake, and oh look the coffee machine is here might as well make myself a coffee. With that last example I made the thing that I felt like doing (using my phone) harder in a way that made the thing I wanted to do easier (getting up early\/getting out of bed when I woke up) essentially I used the motivation to get my phone to assist me in getting out of bed. The simplest way to start designing your environment is to figure out why you don't do the things you want to do or why they\u2019re hard to start doing, and take away as many of the things that add resistance to that task or like with the example of my phone figure out how you can make something that you feel like doing help you do the thing that you want to do.\n\nThings to try if you are struggling with mental health issues such as depression or anxiety:\n\nPhysical Exercise\n\nInclude some form of workout in the morning, I know you\u2019ve likely heard this a million times but physical exercise is a great mood booster. Doing this in the morning will give you a mood boost for the next few hours and make the rest of your day that bit easier, as i mentioned before being in a bad mood will mean you\u2019re less likely to continue with the rest of your routine. You can do anything for this workout and you don't need equipment, simply look on youtube for body weight exercises and choose a few that you enjoy doing, it doesn't need to be super intense but you should aim to do enough so that you can feel you\u2019ve worked out the muscles that you have afterwards. An added benefit to doing this in the morning is in short it afterwards you will feel much more awake. The key here is to choose exercises that you enjoy or at least are easier to start doing, from my own experience it takes me much more mental effort to start doing push ups then it does picking up a couple of dumbbells so I mostly workout with dumbbells. If the workout\/exercise that you start with is too hard physically and that is an issue when it comes to starting it there will be an easier variation, if you're using weights just use less weight if you\u2019re struggling with push ups do knee push ups, if you struggle with knee push ups do wall push ups. You just need to find the right exercises for you.\n\nGratitude\n\nInclude a gratitude practice, having a daily gratitude practice will drastically improve your mental health and can be very quick and easy to do, you can include this at any point in your day however I recommend putting it in the morning, either the thing you do straight after waking up or straight after the 1-3 high resistance activities in your morning. The way this works is by practicing gratitude daily you are essentially training your mind to think more positive and gratitude type thoughts, after a week or so you\u2019ll find that you will be doing some random activity, regardless of its inclusion to your routine, and you will think something like \u201cI am so grateful that\u2026\u201d. The best way I can describe this feeling is, it's like giving your best friend a compliment, you say something to them, see them smile and then you yourself feel great too, that's one of the great things about being human, we are programmed so that doing things for others makes us feel good too. So the quickest and easiest gratitude practice I have found is called gratitude journaling. Simply write down three things that you are grateful for and try not to repeat the same ones everyday, it does not take a long time and there are an infinite list of things to be grateful for and it can be anything (for example I am grateful for the keyboard I am typing this on and all the work that went into making it, or for the people that run Ebay that made it possible for me to buy it). Everything in the world has been created\/manufactured\/invented\/maintained and we tend to take that for granted so if you\u2019re struggling for things to be grateful for start there . I recommend that you use your progress tracking book to write these things down, as you can then kill two birds with one stone and two habits become one. Having a daily gratitude practice was really one of the things that has gotten me out of depression, I can't recommend this practice enough and it\u2019s important to note that the longer you keep gratitude journaling the bigger the benefits become, if this is something you want to try do it for at least 2 weeks before you decide that it's a waste of time.\n\n \n\nPart 3 Mindset\n\nIm not consistent with my routine and I feel bad about it\n\nFeeling a sense of guilt or negativity towards yourself for missing certain tasks or parts of your routine is very normal when you are starting out especially if you are suffering with mental health issues. This can be very off putting but before you start insulting yourself because you didn\u2019t go for a walk this morning there are somethings you should be aware of. First of all it is very likely that this is the first time you have tried to get into a properly planned and thought out routine, we should look at this like it is a skill in a video game the more of it you do the better you get so it is expected that you will fail to stick to your routine in the beginning few months because you are a low level in the \u201csticking to your routine\u201d skill, at the same time you are going to be quite high in the skill of \u201cnot sticking to a routine\u201d so it is expected that you will struggle to start with. But each time you tick off a task you will gain experience in the routine skill and over time you will level it up. As I have said earlier you will need to adjust your routine as you go and this is a part of it. So there are a few things that we can do to help with the negative feelings that come with missing a day or a task, the one I have found to be most impactful is to know that a bad morning doesn't mean the rest of the day has to be bad in fact use this as a source of motivation \u201cI feel bad right now and I\u2019ve missed my morning workout but i'm not going to let the rest of the day be bad\u201d is something along the lines of what i say to myself. This is especially important if you are suffering with depression as it can be very hard to just get out of bed and then you might think to yourself something along the lines of \u201cit\u2019s 1pm I\u2019ve only just managed to get out of bed most of the day is gone I\u2019ve already missed X Y and Z what's the point of trying for the rest of the day\u201d at least this has been my experience, but as I am writing this today I didn't wake up until 11pm and I though what's the point so I went back to sleep and got out of bed at 12pm, got something to eat played some video games for an hour or so and then continued to work on writing this guide, the point is a bad event or a bad start to the day does not mean that the whole day has to be a bad one. In short, during the beginning stages of forming and getting into this routine you need to aim for good not perfect, perfection is the enemy of good, and how can you be perfect without being good first? It\u2019s simple you can\u2019t, at least not in a sustainable manner, you can rely on sheer will power and give yourself the John Wick pep talk in the morning \u201cI am a man of focus, commitment and sheer will\u201d but we\u2019re not John Wick and while this kind of motivational speaking can be great to get you to do things you don\u2019t feel like doing it\u2019s hard to sustain over a longer time period. Which is why the better way forward is to aim for good, tick the box even if you only did the minimum for that task, seriously tick the workout box even if you only did 1 knee push up today.\n\nYour beliefs dictate your actions\n\n\u201cBelieve in yourself\u201d, the quote we\u2019ve all heard a thousand times and rolled our eyes at, but to put it simply, if you dont believe something is possible then you won\u2019t try it, if you don\u2019t believe that you can implement the routine you have come up with then you never will. \u201cThat sounds all well and good but I\u2019ve got 100 reasons why I can\u2019t do it\u201d There is something that we all need to learn about ourselves, we do not know what we can and can not do until we have tried. I did not know that I could improve my mental health in such a drastic way without medication, as I said at the start I felt I needed to try, and so I did and almost a year later here I am writing this guide. In my experience we tend to be really good at coming up with reasons for why we can\u2019t do something, but rarely put those reasons to the test. The solution to this is simple: start putting those beliefs\/reasons to the test. Start to look at it more like it\u2019s a question not an absolute fact. If you can do this then you\u2019ll find you can achieve much more than you thought. Here\u2019s an example of framing it as a fact vs a question. For the example we\u2019ll use getting out of bed in the morning\n\nFact \u201cI can\u2019t get out of bed in the morning, I couldn\u2019t do it yesterday or last week, I can\u2019t do it\u201d as long as this is framed as a fact that you believe you wont be able to get out of bed and weeks will go by and you still can't get out of bed. \n\nQuestion \u201cCould I get out of bed a bit earlier tomorrow? Maybe I could try 5 minutes earlier\u201d the next day he fails to get up 5 minutes earlier \u201cwhy did I fail, was it x was it y, maybe i'll try going to bed earlier\u201d over the next week or so the questioner changes his routine around to find what works and eventually solves the problem.That might not have been the best example but hopefully it got my point across.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678716435.0},{"title":"I have no personality, what do I do?","author":"No-Ambition-No-Life","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11qa84s\/i_have_no_personality_what_do_i_do\/","text":"Right now I\u2019m sat in front of one of my course mates, he\u2019s talking to me about all the things he has going on, he is quite interested while I\u2019m am boring and have nothing to say. \n\nThis is a persistent issue I have when making new friends and I tend to make friends with introverted people (unlike the guy with) as they talk slower or not at all.\n\nI have a pretty slow brain and I think maybe due to covid or prolonged isolation, I\u2019ve lost all social skills.

Im not looking for pity but rather solutions and ideas to better my situation if theres anyone who has had similar life experiences. How do you keep a social life going when you have severe disabilities? Clearly it does make your social circles small if you can't attend anything, if i lived in a populated area or in a different culture i'm sure there would be gatherings and meetings for people with my disabilities etc, but for people in my current situation, that don't have such events available, it feels impossible to have a social life. Having friends, dating and all that jazz. I just feel like im withering away when i dont have any people to connect within my own country \/ culture \/ language in real life. Im completely dependent on disability-aids, mobility-aids and heavy medications. Its the kinda tired that sleep wont fix. Im scared that i dont have the strenght & willpower to hold on much longer just being alone and inside year after year.I really dont understand how disabled people can make friends or have relationships, people always drop me as soon as they realize im disabled or when i tell them that i am, if i lay it out beforehand then im not getting any contacts. So i wonder how on earth do disabled people find people to socialize with who are fine with having a disabled person as a friend and aren't ashamed of it? So please, if anyone has had success with making life bearable with severe disabilities, i'm all ears!

I would say the proudest visible thing I have achieved is weight loss. I was an extremely unhealthy overweight teen and lost 20kg (44lbs)! It wasn't easy, but I never knew how capable I was!! There are goals that made me feel fulfilled, while others didn't even though I did achieve the targets. I didn't understand until I started understanding how my own mind works, which is extremely important to keep myself stay on track!\n\nI think everyone's journey is unique. Everyone's core values, motivation, and fears are also different. So I believe the definition of success should not entirely be based on what society gives us. Or else you will constantly feel deprived no matter how much you accomplish.\n\nThis is what the Enneagram is about: It's a model about your mind process around motivation, values, and fears. There are 9 types of enneagrams in total:\n\n1: Strict, strives for perfectionism\n\n2: Altruistic helper\n\n3: The hyper-achiever\n\n4: The individualist\n\n5: The knowledge hungry investigator\n\n6: The loyal stable person\n\n7: The enthusiastic adventurer\n\n8: The challenger rebel\n\n9: The peacemaker, mediator\n\nYou usually have one core type, and there are two others somewhere in your stack. You can have one type from each group (2,3,4) (5,6,7) (8,9,1)\n\nI personally am a 4w3 479. That means my self-development journey would fulfill me the most when I start embracing my individuality, experience more in life, and having peace. For example, if I got accepted into Harvard, it still may not make me feel happy because that does not fulfill me intrinsically. However, if I travel around the world, that will make me happy because that's my core purpose even if that's no everyone's dream. I feel so confident now because I know exactly what I want and what fulfills me personally. I stopped living someone else's dream because I'm finally true to who I am.\n\nGive this model a try, or at least start discovering what your core values are. Sometimes we may be working towards someone else's agenda without knowing, and that's why many of us feel lost in life no matter how much you succeed. Good luck everyone! If you know your enneagram and tritype please share in this post and tell me briefly about what you wanna do in self-improvement and life!","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678704946.0},{"title":"How do I stop making everything about me?","author":"TheSmallRaptor","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11q0cyq\/how_do_i_stop_making_everything_about_me\/","text":"Getting it out of the way, the irony of this post is not lost on me.\n\nI\u2019ve come to realize that I\u2019m generally annoying to the people around me, especially to my family and coworkers.

(Since they go and have conversations about it elsewhere). \n\nI do want to mention that I was severely bullied when I was around 11-14 years old. The other kids basically attacked me whenever *anything* came out of my mouth. They especially hated when I told my opinion about another person or told them about what they did. That specifically got me into a whole lot of trouble. Also they would nitpick everything I did and gossiped and hated me to no avail. \nFrom that time forward, I promised my self that I would never talk about anyone again.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678661364.0},{"title":"How am I so bad with girls?","author":"LegitimateWasabi6183","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11q1vrd\/how_am_i_so_bad_with_girls\/","text":"Sorry if this sounds very douchebaggery but how is it I can\u2019t hookup with girls but other guys can?

I\u2019ve been pretty depressed mentally, very exhausted, and not confident, and I feel like there\u2019s no point to because of the lack of attention I get from women. I see so many guys, and losers attracting girls like this nothing, and I can\u2019t. I root for them but it makes me jealous. I have it all good on paper. I\u2019m good looking, fit, have good hygiene, have a good paying job, a nice car, a house. Idk what it is but it\u2019s hard for me to talk to them. Not just that but attracting them. My problems start with setting up dates. I feel like my messages are bad because I always get left on read.

I think I know what my problem is I just don\u2019t know how to articulate myself into fixing it. Another thing is I think Redpill is so burned into my head that I get the wrong idea about women. I see them all as mean creatures that play games with us men so we should use them for sex. The Redpill made me anti-simp\/sweet and I\u2019ve always been pretty aggressive when I flirt and I think it just comes off to girls as too mean.

I also tend to lash out verbally but quickly apologize. \n\nSince going off Wellbutrin the irritability has gotten significantly better but is still present, although more so when my symptoms are acting up because they can be fucking infuriating. Most of the irritability came on after some heartache mixed with abuse of prescription dextroamphetamine, and never really went away until I started using cannabis on a regular basis which resulted in me developing psychosis after about a month of heavy use. \n\nAntipsychotics have shot my memory even though I no longer take them so unfortunately I can't remember any examples of my irritability.\n\nI don't have a job and the thought of working a job without stimulants sounds like torture to me. My psychiatrist is hesitant to prescribe stimulants as they can worsen psychosis. So I rely on my family pretty heavily.\n\nI almost revel in self destruction and often go on about how if my doctor doesn't prescribe me stimulants again I'll just take matters into my own hands and self medicate with meth and any negative consequences(such as getting meth cut with fentanyl or RC stims\/bath salts that are often more dangerous than meth itself) will be on my doctor hands for not giving me the medication I need. And Richard Nixon's decrepit corpse for making stimulants so hard to acsess for the general public.\n\nI've been to treatment for addiction and mental health, most I got out of it was a quieting of the voices which was great but it wasn't from the treatment itself and more so the constant opportunities to socialize which really seems to help reduce my psychotic symptoms.\n\nI have no real will to do anything or enjoy anything anymore due to lasting damage from antipsychotics and SSRIs. Wellbutrin (SNDRI) helped a lot and was a miracle drug for awhile but stopped working after a month or two leaving nothing other than irritability and jaw clenching after all the positive effects faded.\n\nI don't know how I'm going to manage to hold down a job or get into college like this, I spent my first year after graduating struggling with psychosis so going to college was the last of my worries.\n\nI'm just burnt out after all of it and overall lethargic and apathetic. And no medication other than a low dose of amphetamines is going to fix that. I've tried methylphenidate based stimulants in the past before I ever developed psychosis and prior to my doctor starting me on amphetamine based stimulant medication. But the methylphenidate based meds just made me feel like shit and had worse physical side effects than the amphetamine based meds. I've heard methylphenidate is better for those with psychosis but it also doesn't work on me and makes me feel like shit so that's off the table.\n\nI just don't see the point in anything other than laying in bed.

My peers there were always rude, cruel, competing with each other in every way and generally insufferable people. Even when I was in elementary school, it was like this. \n\nI was a non-competing kid, unlike the rest. I would appreciate others' accomplishments and truly care about their feelings. So they thought I was weak and always targeted me. \n\nI would get bullied emotionally, though it's slightly different. \n\nThey never bullied me openly, so I could never point their actions out to anyone. \n\nLike, they left me out of their groups and when I tried to speak to them casually, they would just ignore me. When I tried to walk besides them, they would slowly push me out of the sidewalk without any physical contact, you know what I mean. \n\nThere's so much more, there are even open examples of the things they've done but I don't want to talk about them. \n\nThe thing is, the teachers were actually aware of this, they just chose to ignore it because they were close to my bullies' parents. \n\nWhen I'd try to open up to the teachers, they'd get mad at me and tell me to just \"ignore\" my peers. \n\nBut it was impossible though as we, as humans, are social beings. We all need to communicate with our peers to some extend. \n\nSo as I only encountered these bad people in life, I though this was the \"normal\" thing. \n\nI expected everyone to be this way, so I built thick walls around me to protect myself from these \"normal\" people. \n\n**But yesterday, everything changed.** \n\nFor the first time in my life, I've met the actual, real \"normal\" \n\nWhat I mean by that is: I met a peer that is not like the other ones I've met in the past. \n\nShe was very sincere with me, treated me like anyone else and was open with me. \n\nThis was something completely new for me. \n\n**I was in absolute shock.** \n\nI broke down crying from an intense mix of all emotions I have. I didn't know what else to do. I had a huge emotional burst. My heart was pounding like hell. \n\nAll because I was treated like a human being by a peer for the first time. \n\nIn the end, I became aware that there are good people too.

(Some people told me that I look and talk like I don't wanna live but  I'm not sure, I don't feel suicidal at most times)\n* Being obese (since childhood)\n* Daydreaming and fantasizing (a lot, at dangerous levels)\n* Jealousy and wanting to be superior (when someone I know does the same thing with me, like hobbies, I get upset)\n* Not  being clean (I shower and brush my teeth everyday and always clean the  house but still, I don't pay attention to my clothes and feel like I'm  full of bacteria)\n* Having a \"Them vs Me\" mentality\n* Being  physically weak (new people I meet say I look strong but as they start  to know me better, they start to notice I'm weak.

I'm more or less still at the same point I was 10 years ago. I've missed out on so much joy in life, I honestly feel like there's an invisible glasss barrier between me and happiness. I haven't succeeded in anything in my life, really. No qualifications since leaving secondary school, was fat and never good at sports growing up, still am somewhat fat. I work a shit job (Just Over Broke). I've dropped out of uni twice. I'm still a coomer. The thought of how much of my seed has gone into a tissue or another fabric since puberty is insane. To think that there's certain cultures where young men might be married and starting families by the age of 20, and here I am wasting my seed, almost 24. I have tried and failed at suicide attempts multiple times. I moved city in the past year. Since almost after I started PMO'ing as a youth, I fell into cuckold and femdom porn, and haven't been able to get away from it. I fight a mental battle every day not to end up enacting this stuff in my real life, and I feel so ashamed that I struggle to even tell psychologists about it, let alone my friends. I did enact my fantasies with girls on Tinder a few times. I have levels of self-hate and shame in my head I don't think most could understand. I have one specific gift\/talent in life which I believe could rectify everything, and if things changed, it could have meant my past experiences weren't in vain. It is this gift I have that has led me to turn down numerous girls over the past year who i could have probably developed a further relationship with, as I felt like i could do better, but the truth is, at least in this current moment in my life, in this state, I cannot. I hold out hope for myself that my life could change for the better due to 2 things I have going for myself- my gift and my good looks (although i am fully aware that I am presently out of shape). I fear if I settle for the girls i could get now, or just go back to university and settle for a normal, middle-class existence that this miserable feeling that currently exists in my head could just snowball exponenentially, and it's not gonna end well. But I feel like there's almost lightyears of distance between where I am at psychologically now, and the person I feel I could be, if I did act on this gift. I have a Nofap accountability partner, which helps a bit, but God, I wish I had friends who understand how I feel. I feel like I am sinking in quicksand. Honestly, I just look at other people enjoying their lives and feel like they are human and I am an alien. I know my perception is drastically warped, but this is deeply psychologically rooted in me and is hard to shake off. I am past the point of feeling like I can fit in any one specific place any more, or with any one group, I don't even feel like I fit in with any religion, there's a distance between me and any of my friends or family due to what I carry in my head, and it just snowballs. I grew up without a father, or any brothers or siblings, always perceived myself as lesser than those around me and this is hard to shake off. I don't feel like I fit in with either working class or middle class people, any friends I do have are not only very different to me, but also to each other, and have never been able to find myself able to have a \"friend group\" for any sustained period. I wish I felt a sense of brotherhood or belonging, but I understand that these come by proving your worth within circles. The times I was in uni, I never really understood how important being in student accommodation would be, and so found it very hard to make friends and find my place. I am so lost. I don't feel like I can just live a \"normal\" life any more, but also feel a million miles away psychologically from this eye-of-a-needle dream life i always envision. Money alone, couldn't fix how i feel, I desperately crave the attention of being famous and esteemed, to have some sense of status and actually feel valued by people. I've thought about going down certain career paths just for money, but I know that this psychological burden I carry will never feel alleviated until I start to feel valued by people. I've been stuck in this dopamine craving cycle for God-knows how long, between junk food, PMO and social media\/Youtube browsing. Other people even found togetherness in gaming growing up, but I did not, as even that required dedication and practice. I hated growing up without a dad growing up, I felt it heavy when I saw all the other lads at sports growing up with their dads, and I didn't have one. I felt alien for this, and I felt alien for being an only child. I only realised as I grew up, how ashamed I felt for being raised by just a mum, and not having any brothers etc. Any attempts my mother made at instilling discipline in me growing up, I more or less rejected, albeit unconsciously, I realised later that this was because she was a mother and not my dad. I am not one of those normal cases of a child of a runaway dad. I was actually born as a result of a drunken hookup, my mother doesn't even know my dad beyond his surname and a few other details, and as a result, we have never been able to find him. My mother had her own circumstances which led her life astray when she was younger, and while I try to bear this in mind, I cannot help but feel at least some level of deep resentment towards her. Our relationship has somewhat improved in the years since I originally moved out of home, and even moreso since my suicide attempts, but I still cannot fully shake off this feeling of resentment, especially when I cannot attribute it to my father as such (technically I can, but realistically I'd be directing that towards a ghost figure as I have no idea who he is). I can't count the amount of times I have said in my own head that \"i wish my mum just aborted me\". I know that part of the reason my mother did continue to have me and raise me, was to give herself a sense of purpose, which she felt she needed at the time. And yet again i feel an involuntary sense of resentment towards her again for this, as honestly at times, I feel like she could have given herself, and any other potential children of hers a better and more psychologically balanced life if she just held out until she got her own life and a proper steady relationship. And i know that it may be perceived as feminine or childlike to be blaming things on my parents, and to be fair, blame is a stage I want to be past by now, but as I said, this feels like a psychological mountain I have been, and still am carrying alone. I have pretty much always, and still feel invisible. I hate feeling like this. I look at the average dude who i perceive to have gone through a normal middle class experience, had a friend group, had a girlfriend(s) or at least got female attention, had the fun uni experience, and will now enjoy a decent middle class life again after uni, and I cannot help but feel resentment to this type of guy, mostly because I feel like I can never be like them. I have a friend like this, and I feel some level of jealousy and resentment towards him, not really because we went to uni around the same time and he just seems to have had a way better experience of it than I have had. Look I know that most people's lives are not as sweet as they seem, I know this to be the case for that friend that I just mentioned, but this is how skewed my thinking is psychologically, I have been to numerous therapists\/counsellors\/psychologists over the years and no amount of cognitive behavioural therapy or nothing alone can change this, not the self help books or the motivational videos can change my mindset at this point. Only the WORK can at this point, but God, I feel so alone in this, I have always found it next to impossible to be disciplined, that's not to say i've never experienced success in the short term in areas like fitness, but my hyperactive, overthinking mind has always led me astray, dragged me down. It has dragged me to multiple different cities, countries, sports, dragged me through numerous degrees and courses, although none of them successfully, its had me in and out of numerous religious and spiritual lines of thinking. I know success requires rising above your emotions and pushing on, but I only seem capable of doing this for short periods, before the loneliness and frustration hits me, and I drag myself down. The feeling of being miserable is addictive, and it's all I know, and it guides pretty much everything I do, even when I don't realise it is. Before I ramble on all day, is there anyone else who might feel they could even remotely relate to how I feel, who might have had slightly similar circumstances? I know my life circumstances are far from the worst, but I find it hard to not let my mind guide me into this way of thinking. I just wish I had people around me who understood. I wish I had brothers. I wished I wasn't always chasing a feeling of acceptance everywhere I go, even with my own family. Does anyone want to share their burden with me, who wants to turn their life around, but struggle to do this alone. I really feel like I know what I need to do to get to where I want to be, but it's the doing it alone part that holds me back.

Why don't I skip all those extra steps and just study happiness? This made such deep, intuitive sense.

For almost a year and a half (three years for some circumstances) I haven\u2019t been able to enjoy being a part of my favorite fandoms, browsing images, fanart, watching videos, and communicating with fans because of a bad uncontrollable habit I have formed of disliking people or getting really upset and mentally challenged when someone in the fandom likes other entertainment I don\u2019t. It all started when I became a diehard fan of Fire Emblem, a high fantasy tactical RPG series. Ever since I started forming strong distaste of 99.9% of real-world-setting entertainment with supernatural powers, magic, unrealism, etc I have identified myself as a high fantasy fan, preferring fantasy and unrealism to take place in its own \u201ca la Middle Earth world\u201d like LOTR. So when I saw fellow diehard Fire Emblem fans like franchises I find distaste with (Persona and Atlus games is the most common example) it became incredibly challenging to be a part of the fandom, and any other fandoms too. I know it\u2019s completely normal to share interest in only one, maybe two or three entertainment franchises as someone else (my younger sister also enjoys high fantasy but also stuff I\u2019m reallllllly not into like Stranger Things, Harry Potter, or recently, The Last of Us, but I still love her because she\u2019s my sister) but I must have formed a habit of OCD or something because it\u2019s incredibly awkward when someone in a fandom I\u2019m a part of likes a franchise I dislike. My family and I started being massively invested into Star Wars (especially Mandalorian!) and even though I love Star Wars, I realize that the vast majority of Star Wars fans tend to also enjoy superhero movies (massive dislike) and George Lucas\u2019 other work, Indiana Jones (also not a fan).\n\nI really don\u2019t want to feel like this anymore!

We are both on self-improvement (Gym, reading, meditation, all of that) and we were really busy. But it was busy to a level that sometimes, she could pass a day without even seeing my texts.\n\n\\-One time, she confessed that sometimes she just ignored me because beign attentive was not in her nature, or she just \"didn't felt\" like answering my messages.

So I just graduated my bachelor\u2019s degree in 2021 and I started working summer of 2022 and I enjoy the work that I\u2019m doing (a 9 to 5) I for sure feel like I\u2019m improving and learning a lot in my job.\n\nMoving on over to my love life, this is where it gets interesting. I was in my first relationship in 2021 which lasted only 6 months and it was a rough breakup where for me personally I felt like I was done really wrong and I felt like she didn\u2019t really care much about me in the relationship and how she handled the breakup. Post breakup my mindset was shifted towards bettering myself. This meant doing the things that I didn\u2019t get the chance to regularly do when I was together with her (i.e. reading, journaling, learning new things, working out). The first few months went well.\n\nEver since I started to work, I\u2019ve always felt like after months of being single I\u2019m finally convinced that I\u2019m ready to start a healthy relationship this time. However I find that I don\u2019t really have the time to put myself out there to put myself in the position to find a high value woman. With work, free time is limited and basically I only have Friday nights and the weekend to properly socialize on top of the regular chores that I have to do. I\u2019ve resorted into dating apps but I find this quite inconsistent as I much prefer to meet people and women in person.\n\nThis turned into a domino effect where for the last few months I\u2019ve felt extremely lonely at times and even felt like I am wasting time in my 20s. I know comparison is terrible but seeing old high school friends and college friends getting engaged or married on social media every weekend doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019m completely open to trying new things and meet new people but I find that maybe because I\u2019m quite picky it\u2019s difficult to find my type of people in the city\/country I\u2019m living in. \n\nWanted to see on this subreddit if anyone has been through something similar or have tips to get through a situation like this?

Well, as much as I'd love to explore that idea, today we're going to talk about something a bit more serious. I took up this challenge about reading 100 books within a year, (I\u2019m nowhere near completing the goal but it\u2019s fun) this sent me down a pretty deep rabbit hole of self-development and evolutionary biology and other boring stuff recently and there\u2019s something that I feel is less talked about.\n\nAlright, let's talk about masculinity, folks. It's a really complex concept that's been defined and redefined over the years, but apparently, some folks still haven't figured out that giving back to the community is a pretty important attribute. I mean, sure, go ahead and focus on all that red pill and self-help nonsense, I mean obviously, the whole sphere is not nonsense but I do find that it is increasingly becoming hard to filter through all the BS.  But let\u2019s go back to the stuff I think is missing today, I absolutely believe that you should approach your life as if you are writing a script for a badass movie but remember that every hero's story ends with them giving back to the community. You know, because it's not really heroic unless you're doing it for someone else. I mean yeah, you don\u2019t devote your entire life to it but I really don\u2019t see people talking much about giving back to the community, a community or any community for that matter.\n\nTake a look at some of the popular mythical masculine heroes across different cultures like European, Indian, and Chinese. They all have this one common trait of giving back to the community. Hercules is known for his incredible strength and heroism, but apparently, that wasn't enough for him. After his heroic deeds, he became a protector of the people and continued to help those in need. Because, you know, what's the point of being a hero if you're not going to help others?\n\nThen there's Arjuna from Indian mythology, who's not only a skilled archer and warrior but also has compassion and wisdom. After winning a great battle, he becomes a king and rules justly, always putting the needs of his people first. Because what good is being a king if you're not going to help out your subjects?\n\nAnd of course, we can't forget Sun Wukong from Chinese mythology, the monkey king with incredible strength and magical powers. He's known for his mischievousness and his battles against demons and other supernatural beings, but guess what? He's also a protector of the innocent and often uses his powers to help those in need. Because what good is all that adventure when you can\u2019t help out your fellow man?\n\nIn case you are wondering, yeah I am literally turning into uncle Ben over here, and going all \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility\u201d. Duh! Do you know why? I\u2019ve been reading a bit of Carl Jung\u2019s work and I believe, the most significant struggle of a man's life is about being useful. And being useful can mean a lot of things, but helping someone without expecting anything in return is one of the most basic. Without these men, society would crumble. So yeah, giving back to the community is not only a responsibility but also a way of fulfilling one's potential as a man. But hey, what do I know? I'm just a pretentious dude who is trying to become a better writer. Tbh, the whole thing is sort of like a rant, where I can just shout, WHY AREN\u2019T MORE PEOPLE DOING THIS?\n\nNow when I say giving back, I don't necessarily mean giving money or charity. It can be any cause where a bit of your time would be helpful. For example, advising men on Reddit with grooming, (I personally try doing something similar to this by trying to help everyone who approaches me in dms asking for advice on how to start a career in my field which is data science), or even cleaning a bit of your neighborhood even for one hour a week, volunteering, tutoring, or helping others who are struggling in a field that you are skilled in. As long as it's making someone else's life better by at least a small margin. But again, what do I know? I'm just a keyboard warrior. But I swear it does make me feel a bit better.\n\nI get it, giving back isn't an easy task. It's so much easier to be addicted to our phones and complain about what's wrong with the world than to actually look at the good around us. But hey, giving back might not cure depression, but it's a good place to start. And you can start small. For example, volunteering at a local charity for an hour or two, donating clothes or other goods to a shelter, or simply helping a neighbor with their groceries. These actions may seem insignificant, but they can make a big difference in someone's life. Like, trust me\u2026 these small actions do add up. I am friends with all my neighbors, and honestly, my apartment building feels like a way different environment than it was a few months ago.

Instead of just saying \"I should help more people,\" start saying \"I am someone who helps others.\" This same thought process made me pick up writing, stop smoking weed every day and do lots of other things. Even the job I have now was forwarded by someone who I befriended in a data science workshop, I was a budtender working minimum wage trying to break into the data science career so I attended a bunch of these meets online to make connections. He was building a portfolio and I told them that I could help them build one for free. A few weeks later he forwards me a job posting thinking that it would be the perfect fit for me.

You feel stress or tension. Focus on this feeling. It helps to lower your shoulders and breathe into it. Take the time to just sit down and figure out which emotion this is \n\n2. Now that you\u2019ve identified it, let yourself sink into the feeling. Welcome that feeling like you would a guest into your house and truly get to know it. \n\nLearn what these emotions feel like. Become familiar with them. The more you let yourself feel the emotion the faster it will pass and you can move on \n\nRumi wrote \u201cpain is where the light enters you\u201d this is true in my experience. There\u2019s only so much pain there and underneath it is love, not bullshit Hollywood love, but something far more profound. \n\n3. Repeat the pattern again. Next time you feel stressed take note of it and sit with it when you have time \n\nHERES A QUICK LIST OF EMOTIONS\n\nyou know what anger feels like so let\u2019s focus on some emotions that you might now be familiar with. All these emotions carry so much weight to them. The weight makes life so heavy, you want to shed the weight and then you have more energy \n\nGuilt (feels like duty, obligation, \u201cI should\u2019s\u201d blame and accepting blame, defensiveness and accusations\n\nShame (embarrassment, humility, unworthiness, self hatred, self sacrifice, living for others, what will others think of me?)\n\nGrief (heavy heavy emotion, sadness, weakness, excessive need to be strong and just get by, \u201clife\u2019s so hard\u201d mentality \n\nFear (scarcity esp. around money, not having enough, \u201cI\u2019m not safe\u201d freezing up)\n\nYou\u2019re gonna say \u201caren\u2019t their good emotions\u201d \n\nThis is where we stray from the path\n\nAll emotions are distortions. By simply having emotional blockages we\u2019you\u2019re giving up so much of your energy\n\nPicture this, your boss tells you manager to pay you $1,000 and the manager pays you $100. Because you didn\u2019t know what was available you thank the manager so much for his generous contribution. Emotions are the same. \n\nWe believe that feelings of duty or anger can give us that energy but they actually take it and regulate it and give a fraction back to us. If you knew what was available you wouldn\u2019t settle for a moment. That energy is rightfully yours you just have to figure out how to access it. \n\nFollow this emotional release framework and you\u2019ll free up SO MUCH of your energy, you\u2019ll drastically expand your comfort zone, you\u2019ll clear up your cognition and be able to think so much clearer now that the latent fight or flight response is gone \n\nI truly hope this helps you as much as it\u2019s helped me.

We've been trying this arrangement for about 9 months with mixed results. I started seeing someone from my friend group, let's call her \"X,\" and I tried to make it clear at the beginning what the terms and boundaries of the open arrangement were, among them being that we're not allowed to catch feelings for each other. Well, we caught feelings for each other. It was wrong, but we kept seeing each other because we had a lot of fun together. At one point I thought me and my partner were going to break up, but then managed to settle things. X knew about my relationship troubles, and was certain I was going to break up with my partner and start dating her, but that didn't happen and she got (I'd argue rightfully) upset: she felt that I had led her on, and while I didn't mean to, in hindsite I can see how my discussing of my troubles would lead her to that conclusion. Over time, we were able to smooth things out, and decided to keep seeing each other, this time attempting a more platonic relationship. She set a boundary asking for me to not \"get with\" anyone else whie we try and sort this out. Then we went to a mutual friend's birthday party; we'll call the mutual friend \"Y.\" I got WAY too drunk (to the point where I don't remember most of the night), and apprently I kissed Y. X is (rightfully) FURIOUS with me, and Y is deeply embarassed and selfconcious.\n\nI recognize that this entire situation going bad is my own doing: a clear boundary was set, and I crossed it while drunk, and I know drunkenness is not an excuse for unacceptable behavior, even if it was to the point where I can't remember what happened. X and Y both have every right to be angry with me as what I did hurt them both. I'm not looking for forgiveness and I'm not looking for a way to get things back to \"the way they were.\" I feel like complete and utter shit, especially since X feels gaslit and used and dragged along with my own shit. I genuinely didn't mean to hurt anyone, but I'm not a smart man and I handled this entire situation extremely poorly. I care a lot about X, Y, and my partner, and I want to know what steps I can take to start making amends. Again, I'm not trying to seek forgiveness or try and get back into anyone's good graces: at this point, I feel that many bridges are well and truly burned. But it kills me that I hurt people I care about. I've been beating myself up about it all day, and I know that's neither helpful nor productive.

Say for example you weren't allowed to be angry as a child, or insert x emotion, then as a child you had to learn to bury the anger\/emotion to maintain a loving connection with your family. We get so good at burying the emotions that as adults we have no idea we are doing it or how we are doing it.\n\nThe technique is very simple. It's basically a conversation where I ask you to become conscious of whatever feelings\/emotions\/thoughts are present in your direct experience, and then we begin to understand the feelings and break the habitual pattern of distraction and dissociation. I believe over time as we continue to do this, repressed emotions will begin to surface, and if we create space for them they can flow through our body and be processed.\n\nWhen we don't process emotions and they remain repressed, I believe our system uses a tremendous amount of energy to keep this things buried, and so by not dealing with these emotional traumas we doom ourselves to chronic fatigue, emotional numbness, and in many cases deep misery and unhappiness.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions about myself or the process.\n\nThank you","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678608962.0},{"title":"Self learning skills","author":"Mr_Jaber","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11p8iy6\/self_learning_skills\/","text":"How do i balance between college study and self learning skills ?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678606314.0},{"title":"Goals for Day-2","author":"Subash-11831","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11p1hcl\/goals_for_day2\/","text":"It's day 2 guys, today I have only one assignment to write cuz, I completed most of them yesterday.

This means nearly every kind of social media currently available.","author":"pronlegacy001","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11ort1g\/if_you_want_massive_change_in_your_life_abandon\/","text":" **Algorithmic models of content generation is at its core, a slot machine for social media.** Enough finger movement up scrolling or swipes, the little duckies, or flowers, or pirates are going to lineup and you're going to get a dopamine jackpot.\n\nNow, dopamine spikes are not real. It's actually worse. That \"Spike\" in dopamine you feel when getting on TikTok is **actually** your brain raising the overall threshold it needs to feel happy and satisfied. This threshold is at the highest it has ever been in human history with the advent of social media. However, algorithmic scrolling and especially TikTok takes it to a whole new level.\n\nThe **reason** it is so addicting is not due to its actual content. In fact, you're going to end up with **less** content than other platforms if you had chosen the actual content yourself. A 30 minute youtube video pertaining to your interests actually gets you **more** of what you want. Yet for some reason, TikTok and other short form social media is platform of choice.\n\nThe reason boils down to the actual mechanics of the apps and already proven and useable psychological science. TikTok and other companies combine slot machine mechanics with social and human connection.\n\nWhy are slot machines (and gambling at large) so popular? **Because the outcome is uncertain**. While the actual outcome is certain as a probability found in math, to the subconsious human brain it is an entire mystery. The next jackpot could be **just one more roll away**. Your wife will actually **thank you** for selling her grandmother's wedding ring when she has a million dollars!\n\nThis is why horror movies struggle with the ending. As long as the threat is uncertain, the director can focus on letting your imagination and perception of an uncertain future drive your fear. The same mechanic works for pleasure, pain, sex, love, etc.\n\nHumans **love controlled uncertainty**. And scrolling and shorts is social media predicated entirely on controlled uncertainty. You may have some sort of algorithm. And it may be tuned towards you. But you truly never know what's around the next corner.\n\n**This is exactly why \"Scrolling\" on social media is so addicting**. By letting that algorithm take over you can scroll much longer than you can stand to look for something on a streaming service.\n\nTikTok takes it to a new level. There is a reason their \"Search\" options are such dogshit. Why you can't easily find videos that a creator has made a year ago. There's a reason why they designed the app to have you mainly depend on your FYP. It's a slot machine for human experience. Swipe up and you may laugh, cry, be angry, etc. The one thing you won't be is bored.\n\nThis fact alone makes it a **diabolical** app for people's lives. What makes it **worse** is that what it offers is catered to the specific needs of the person.\n\nSomeone desperate for money and someone who feels trapped is going to be easily hooked into a slot machine. But someone who has no financial issues and doesn't exactly have a weakness to reckless spending isn't going to be as drawn or as much of a target market for slot machines. Slot machines have a very limited market.\n\nBut TikTok and other algorithmic social media doesn't have those kind of market limitations. They can target **anyone with any deficiency in their life with a FYP to give them their fix**. Feeling lonely? there's plenty of content for you. Angry? yep. Horny? you bet. Need a laugh? TikTok can provide. **All with slot machine mechanics**.\n\nIt's a slot machine for life. And it's dangerous. Dumbasses think that these companies are trying to steal your information. Nope. A VPN won't do shit. They don't give a fuck about your info. **They want your time.** Time = revenue. That's it. The only information they want, is info that can keep you on their app for longer and buying their advertisers products. That's it.\n\nSo my advice? Get off of any social media that focuses on algorithmic scrolling. Especially ones that offer stuff like shorts or reels. And above all get off of TikTok.\n\nTake back your time. Take back your life.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1678560703.0},{"title":"Why doesn\u2019t my mind learn?","author":"peachy_queenx","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11or02w\/why_doesnt_my_mind_learn\/","text":"I have suffered will mental illness for over half my life now and I still can\u2019t fathom how despite mountains of therapy, medication and just general experience that my mind can\u2019t compute that worrying and stressing gets me nowhere!? \n\nI\u2019m currently in a three day spiral and I\u2019m finding it hard to keep a positive mindset. \n\nAny mantras or personal experience would be greatly appreciated.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678558760.0},{"title":"Should I learn coding or copywriting? all I care about is making money and self employment not working for others.","author":"ImArealAlchemist","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11p81da\/should_i_learn_coding_or_copywriting_all_i_care\/","text":"I'd like to just start my own business but I feel like i have absolutely nothing to offer . nothing of value to give or anything like that.\n\nI want to employ myself and not resort ot working for someone else ever in my life. which is the better option ?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678604581.0},{"title":"Getting dumber","author":"Non_Humanewell","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11p2xes\/getting_dumber\/","text":"Sometimes I feel like I'm getting dumber, as the days pass.    \nThe way I behave and talk sometimes makes me feel like I'm way younger than I am, more clueless and oblivious.   \nI sleep too much now, around 12 hours non stop, or even more if I could.

Most videos are completely worthless as well and don't contribute to your life in any way other than to pass time. Yes, there are some actually worthwhile videos that can be very helpful, but the majority aren't like that. \n\nI cut down the amount of short videos I watch by a lot (most days I don't watch them at all, and on the days I do, the very most amount of time I spend is about 1h) and my free time feels a lot more productive. I have a lot more free time now which I use to do something actually productive, like learning how to play the guitar, or working out, or anything else that doesn't involve screens. I generally feel a lot better now that I've cut it down. \n\nAnd I am aware just completely removing it from your everyday lives is very difficult and it takes a lot of self control\/discipline, but it's worth it. If anyone wants to do this, I recommend instead of going cold turkey, just limit the amount per day. See how much you time you usually spend watching short videos, then set a reasonable daily maximum, and keep that up for a bit.

But I cannot decide between these two choices I have.\n\nRecently I got a job at this bougie grocery store. It's wonderful. It pays well, everyone's so damn friendly and understanding, but the hours are crazy and I feel like I don't really vibe well with the overall group there. I don't have any peers I see myself befriending anytime soon, and Ive become increasingly overwhelmed with the work load AND handling school. I've been working there for four days, each of them eight hour shifts that took away from my studies that I usually have time for (I'm in college). Of course, I talked to my Team Leaders about this and they were, again, very understanding and didn't feel as hurt or angry as I thought they would feel. They said that they wouldn't mind cutting my hours down if that helped me out, but I don't know if I see myself staying there even after the hours whittling down. I'm gonna take an internship later this year too, and doing the grocery store stuff and an internship and feeling \"off\" there.. I don't know.\n\nOverall, I don't know that this job is \"for me\" right now. It's pretty intense, even if the people are nice and helpful. It seems like a job I could have after college, not during. And after I graduate, I wouldn't even mind the idea. But right now, I don't know. I feel like saying \"oh I can only do two shifts during the week\" is a waste of both of our times, especially if I feel that way. \n\nBut the pay is great. It's gonna put money in my pocket and keep me financially secure, but it doesn't really make me happy that much. I'm kinda stressed.\n\nThe other job that I'm considering is a department store job in a mall nearby. It has shorter work hours, and it pays a dollar less.  It's still good money but a dollar less. The vibe of the store seems to match what I am and what I like: edgy yet casual shoes and apparel. This was the job that called me first before the grocery store job but because of conflicting scheduling, I ended up passing on an interview opportunity and went with the grocery store. Now, I'm kinda regretting it. The vibe of the store and the employees is much closer to what I'm about. The pay is less, yeah, but the hours are shorter and I can fit more into my schedule so I can go to work without being too restrictive. The only issue I'm worried about working there is stability.\n\nI don't want to leave another job again. I want to stay here this time. I want to stay at a job that will keep my grades happy, me happy, and my wallet happy. And if I leave the grocery store to come to the mall, I'm worried I'm making a \"downgrade\". I work long shifts at the store, but I'm guaranteed above 20 hours. Mall hours don't always promise that unless it's the fucking holidays or something. Usually you'll be lucky if you get 15 a week. Trust me, I've worked at a mall before.\n\nI already decided I wouldn't be quitting until I got that other job lined up. If I interviewed, I'd tell them please give me two weeks so I can say my goodbyes and wrap up with the store before transitioning. So there's no worries about me running and ghosting now.\n\nBut I haven't decided whether or not this will be a good idea. I want to work where I vibe well and that it feels \"right\" to me. I know plenty of people who've worked jobs that didn't feel right to them for whatever reason, but stayed and became miserable. I don't want that to happen to me. I want to be happy and make good money. I love my coworkers at my current job, but this job doesn't feel like it's right for me, both college wise and just personality wise. I'm upbeat and outgoing, but I'm not sure.\n\nI was also told that the door would be open for me to come back there in the future if I wanted to.\n\nSo, what do you guys think I should do?

I'm following DailyStoic and found their daily newsletter very helpful. I've been dealing with acute anxiety, and Stoic principles really help me put things in perspective. I think the very first thing to deal with anxiety is to examine your perspectives, in particularly your WANTS and your FEARS. Most of the time you are anxious because you want something out of your control (like money, status, etc.) and you are afraid bad things will happen if you can't have those things under control. So, I found these two-step practice helps to calm my nerves (no matter how temporary) when dealing with anxiety:\n\n1. Recognize my thoughts: knowing what I am anxious about really helps. When I am anxious, I'll take some time off what I am doing, take a deep breath and take a walk outside to process the currents of thoughts that overwhelm me. I then realize that what I am worried about is something I have no control over, no matter how I want it to happen. I tell myself: there's nothing I can do about it. The only thing I can do is to focus on the present, and do the best thing to take care of myself and my loved ones. Life is short. There's no need to worry about things that may or may not happen.\n2. Assess my fears: Normally, I am anxious because I am fearful that something bad will happen. In those moments, I remember what is written in the book How to stop worrying and start living by Dale Carnegie, think of the worst case scenario, and see if you can deal with it. Turns out in most cases, I can. It might hurt my pride to not succeed, but I'll survive and maybe I can even make something better.\n\nFinally, I keep thinking about my mortality daily. Life is short, I may die tomorrow. The rose garden in the horizon may never come. Of course, we are faced with so many inconveniences in our daily life, big or small. And there are days when we will break down and cry. But knowing that these moments will pass, as long as we are alive there's always something to live for.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678551497.0},{"title":"I\u2019m lonely with no personality","author":"VisibleDog3140","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11ot776\/im_lonely_with_no_personality\/","text":"My personality has disintegrated over the past few years to the point I don\u2019t even feel like a human anymore.\n\n19M in college who was fairly sociable and well liked in HS and had a few good friend groups. Got pretty heavy into smoking weed and I think this is where it started to go downhill as I declined to go out to bigger events like parties and gatherings in favor of smoking with a few close friends. Well fast forward to now in college and all of these close friends have drifted away whether that be moving or just losing touch over time. Thankfully I had one good close friend that stuck with me since I started college and he was the only reason I still had a social life.\n\nHe would introduce me to new people our age but I could never form any new connections as I feel I would have nothing to say or if I did I would end up pissing multiple people off. In fact I pissed off so many of his friends that a lot of them were talking shit about me behind my back and some of them even wanted to fight me. I think this rubbed off on my close buddy and it made our time together kind of tense and uncomfortable so we just mutually stopped talking to each other. (Haven\u2019t smoked since we stopped hanging out)\n\nThat was about 3 months ago and since then I\u2019ve been so lonely and isolated it hurts. I have classes a few days a week but I decline to go to those as I can\u2019t even muster the strength to talk to people, or if I do it is only school related and I can never connect with anyone else on a personal level. Thankfully I can get my work done at home but sometimes I have to go in for whatever reason and when I\u2019m in class I can\u2019t think about anything besides the fact that I\u2019m the weird loner who doesn\u2019t have any friends. I also quit my job a few months ago because I got into a fight with a co-worker where I punched first and I got scared he would rat me out so I just never showed up again. \n\nI also have a super depressive demeanor which I can\u2019t shake because Im terrible at faking my mood and this has rubbed off super bad with my parents. Both my mom and step dad probably despise me right now because Im so lifeless and moody. They used to want to spend time with me or even talk to me but know they barely acknowledge that I exist. I literally feel like there\u2019s no one I can even talk to right now and it\u2019s made me super depressed and lonely to the point I don\u2019t see a reason to get out of bed.\n\nAll in all I think I\u2019m just super toxic and can\u2019t make new friends as I have some social inhibition that prevents me from being normal, and now that most of my social outlets are gone I\u2019m literally just a corpse that can move.

I do the minimal amount of work at a very leisurely pace, honestly probably just enough to keep me from getting fired though I'm fairly certain my coworkers\/boss have quietly noticed that things are moving slowly on my end. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've frequently heard the solution of \"occupy your freetime with other hobbies\" but honestly I have MANY projects and hobbies that I would love to do more of, but my lizard brain just keeps prioritizing gaming. Any tips on conditioning my brain to do work consistently instead of taking frequent and long gaming breaks?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would be interested in testing for some focus-related mental disorder such as ADD, but there are 2 things keeping me from doing so:\n\n1. I live at home with my family (in true degenerate fashion), and they have no idea any of this is happening and I don't want them to know that I've been gaming during work hours. They also wouldn't take too kindly to finding out that it's a full-blown addiction and that I need outside help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. I'm not so sure about the evaluation process. From what I understand, a therapist's evaluation is based on a set of questions they ask you. For some reason I expected a more concrete or scientific evaluation process, as it sounds easy to lie\/exaggerate\/omit info to either force a diagnosis or to avoid one depending on whether you want to be branded with something like ADD for life. Let me know if I'm wrong, as I understand there's a lot more to therapy and diagnosing than simple questions and I don't mean to offend the therapists out there, I'm just worried about being mis-diagnosed\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I work full-time remotely and am addicted to gaming throughout the day. It's affected my work, hobbies, and passion projects but I can't seem to be able to put the controller down. Possibly have something like ADD but I'd rather test as a last result option as the process of being evaluated\/diagnosed scares me.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678544114.0},{"title":"How do I learn to set better boundaries with my adult daughter","author":"bueller_tx","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11ocx6d\/how_do_i_learn_to_set_better_boundaries_with_my\/","text":"My daughter is undiagnosed, but has a lot of characteristics of BPD & narcissism.  She\u2019s in her 20\u2019s living at home.  \nWe all (family of 4) had a rough week because of her moods and playing victim over what we saw as silly things.  She texts me a lot while I\u2019m trying to work and she got upset about something I said.  I told her I would prefer to sit down and talk about it.  \n\nOnce she got home and we started talking I realized the only way was for me to just apologize even though I didn\u2019t really do anything wrong (I forgot to do something she asked me to do and she was left in her room waiting so she could go to bed).  She wanted to hear that it was thoughtless of me not to consider she was tired and to empathize how this and other oversights make her feel unwanted and unloved. \n\nI texted my therapist earlier and she\u2019s of the opinion that I need to get her to move out. I\u2019m a codependent person with anxiety and OCD and when stressed my defense is to fawn.  That\u2019s a perfect combo for someone that tends to be very narcissistic.  My husband just tells me don\u2019t engage (his mother was a narcissist) but even if I try to ignore her, she gets upset about that.\n\nI\u2019ve offered to pay and practically begged her to get help but she goes a few times and decides to quit.  Her issues come in waves and when she\u2019s better she doesn\u2019t want to go.  \n\nAnyway after an awful week, she\u2019s now being sweet; almost overly sweet.  I guess she\u2019s happy I apologized or maybe it was just the time one on one that helped. \n\nI know this will happen again and walking on eggshells is no fun. I did that my whole childhood.   I don\u2019t want to just tell her to get out in anger.  But I don\u2019t know how to bring up the topic without it sounding like an ultimatum.  If she would at least try to get better other than watching videos about it, that would really help, but she\u2019s not going to get better if she doesn\u2019t really want to do it.  \n\nSorry this got so long!

Energy is the key, its the answer that dissolves the question.\n\nMore energy is always the solution to any problem.

If you watch Limitless, the solution to every problem is more energy - the solution is never found within the constraints of the lower emotional reality.\n\nMore energy frees up mental capacity. \"State management\" is a tenet of NLP and sales training but this is just short term energy mechanics.

My concern is building a lasting base of 8\/10 to 10\/10 energy and I figured out a way to do it.\n\nSo how do you get more energy? Its simple, **release stored up emotions**. The way to release emotions is to feel how you're feeling and internalize it. Find things that trigger you - frustration, sadness, etc and then pull that emotion up to feel it. The emotion runs its course and goes away and you feel lighter.\n\nFeeling lighter is the hallmark of higher energy. Its called en\"lighten\"ment for a reason. Its the indication of higher a higher energy level.\n\nThe higher your energy level goes the more the world reacts to you but that's a story for another time.\n\nIf your goal is to succeed in business - energy is the primary currency.

When I entered college everyone was good with me. At first I thought maybe the mistake is mine, I started speaking with them, Everything was fine but they suddenly stopped speaking with me, they would take the person next to me to canteen but not me. They will bring some snacks from canteen. They will share it with everyone except me. But when Exams come they will all come begging to show answers at exam. I thought maybe all the Boys are like this and I started speaking with girls but no surprise girls are the same those bitches just used me like a tissue and thrown me when I am of no use. I was isolated from these jackass classmates of mine. During College I maximum speak like 10 words, that's it They won't even speak with if they don't need me. So I decided to live happier but It is not possible with my classmates, I will start speaking with my neighbouring class. During my class I will focus on studies. I will become class 1st in studies and I won't speak with them, this time I will ignore them. I will spend my days in school very happier that everyone in my class will be jealous and regret not speaking with me. This is Day 1 in my self improvement journey to get revenge on my Classmates. My Goals in this self improvement journey is to,\n1)Become Fit\n2)Become Self Sufficient\n3)Become a Enjoyable person to be around\n4)Learn Martial Arts\n5)Become More Masculine\n6)Become Financially Intelligent\n7)Become Stoic\n8) Improve my Social Skills\n\nI will report my daily activity to you guys.

My classmates will be tempted to talk with me but they can't cuz I will ignore them once I achieve this\n\nMy Plan for Day-1:\nToday I must become take steps to self-sufficient. I have been given some assignment, I will complete them all faster without asking my dumb classmates for help.\nOnce I complete those assignments I will send those assignments to them. Because they should not think, if I refuse to give them the assignment they will search the book for those soon they will stop relying on me. I will keep them idiots. After completing those 4 assignment, I will continue the book called        \"Cash flow quadrant\" I am at page 38 currently, maybe I will read 10 pages today.

In my past, I was a very shy kid which led to me being taken advantage of, getting bullied, and being a general doormat. This led to me having strong social anxiety almost all throughout school, yet again being a people pleaser, and getting bullied, and being a loner in general. A big portion of my life, I basically spent playing video games on my own, doing schoolwork, and distracting myself with content. I did have mostly one friend which I was close with, and a few acquaintances, but there were also phases where I was completely alone. I don\u2019t think I was weird per se, more just really anxious and bending my opinions to be liked by everyone because I was that desperate to fit in and not feel like a loser. I cared too much about what others thought about me.\n\nNow I'm older and within the last year, my social anxiety has improved a lot although I'm still struggling. I think it's because I worked retail with people my age. I regularly go to the gym, started going to concerts even alone, can have a conversation with new people, even the really pretty girls, etc. I also look much better than in my weird puberty phase. Now people seem to show more interest in me as I'm talking more. However, whenever they want to talk to me and ask about my social life or past, I feel insecure and make up little lies to make me seem like a normal cool dude who has or at least had a good social circle. In reality, my social life atm is one good friend I'm doing activities with, and I'm insecure about my lack of life experience.\n\nThe thing is, I really feel like I'm a cool guy to hang around but that I just had bad circumstances or awareness at that time. But the more little lies I tell, the more, especially girls that are interested in me, sense that I'm not genuine or I'm acting insecure. The lies also lead me to be more cautious about what I say, like being in my head and not being free. The alternative is that I tell them that I was not really all that in the past and still catching up to create a genuine and healthy social circle. However, I know that if I do that, there is a high chance they see me as a loser and not that easygoing cool dude. They wonder if there is something wrong with me, especially with attractive girls I'm interested in. They think it's unattractive and lose interest in me because they still think I'm like that.\n\nI really don't know how I can get out of this situation. Is there a way out of this situation, a way to feel confident despite my flawed circumstances? Do you have an idea how I can sell my honestly kind of sad past without people feeling pity, looking down on me, or losing attraction? Any advice or input is welcomed. Basically, now when I'm meeting someone new, I'm easy going and confident at first, but after the connection goes deeper, both platonically and romantically, I feel insecure about my past and have trouble relating and lack stories and anecdotes which keep the other person interested. It feels impossible to create relationships and friendships with the people I want.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678499595.0},{"title":"Suggestion on what to use a wellness reimbursement on","author":"chasingpavements27","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11o2595\/suggestion_on_what_to_use_a_wellness\/","text":"I recently started a new job and they have a $50 reimbursement for a wellness benefit monthly.

However, with so many distractions and demands on our time, it can be challenging to stay focused and productive. Fortunately, there are several tips and strategies you can use to improve your performance and achieve your goals. In this article, we will explore some of the most effective ways to increase your efficiency and productivity.\n\n1. Set Clear Goals and Priorities\n\nOne of the most critical factors in increasing performance is setting clear goals and priorities. When you have a clear idea of what you want to achieve, it is easier to stay focused and motivated. Start by identifying your long-term goals and then break them down into smaller, more manageable tasks. Determine what tasks are most important and prioritize them accordingly. This will help you stay on track and ensure that you are making progress towards your objectives.\n\n1. Create a Schedule and Stick to It\n\nCreating a schedule is an excellent way to manage your time effectively and increase your productivity. Set aside specific blocks of time for tasks that need to be done and prioritize them according to their importance. Try to stick to your schedule as much as possible and avoid distractions that can throw you off track. Use a timer or other tools to help you stay on task and make the most of your time.\n\n1. Eliminate Distractions\n\nDistractions are one of the most significant barriers to productivity. They can disrupt your focus and make it challenging to stay on task. To increase your performance, it is essential to eliminate as many distractions as possible. This can include turning off your phone or email notifications, closing unnecessary tabs on your computer, or working in a quiet, distraction-free environment.\n\n1. Take Regular Breaks\n\nTaking regular breaks is an essential part of increasing your performance. While it may seem counterintuitive, taking breaks can actually help you stay focused and productive over the long term. Breaks give your brain a chance to recharge and can help you avoid burnout. Try taking short, frequent breaks throughout the day, or schedule longer breaks for activities that help you relax and recharge.\n\n1. Prioritize Self-Care\n\nSelf-care is critical for maintaining high levels of performance over the long term. Taking care of your physical and emotional well-being can help you stay focused and motivated, even during challenging times. Prioritize activities that promote self-care, such as exercise, healthy eating, and getting enough sleep. Make time for hobbies or activities that bring you joy and help you relax.\n\n1. Continuously Learn and Improve\n\nFinally, one of the most effective ways to increase your performance is to continuously learn and improve. Stay up-to-date with the latest developments in your field, take courses or attend workshops to improve your skills, and seek out feedback from colleagues or mentors. Continuously learning and improving can help you stay motivated, increase your confidence, and improve your overall performance.\n\nIn conclusion, increasing your performance requires a combination of strategies and habits. By setting clear goals, creating a schedule, eliminating distractions, taking breaks, prioritizing self-care, and continuously learning and improving, you can improve your efficiency, productivity, and ultimately achieve your goals. Remember that increasing your performance takes time and effort, but with persistence and dedication, you can achieve the results you desire.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678492249.0},{"title":"increasing Performance: Tips for Improving Your Efficiency","author":"devencripe","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11o4vnu\/increasing_performance_tips_for_improving_your\/","text":"increasing Performance: Tips for Improving Your Efficiency\n\nPerformance is an essential aspect of success, whether it be in your personal or professional life.

While I did enjoy the first few months, I ended up feeling lonely, I realized how much I wasn't growing, how little interaction I was having with others, how much I wasn't experiencing.  The first thing I wanted to do was be an electrician.  I kept looking up videos on Youtube.  I read a few chapters from a textbook Electricity 1-7.  I thought that was a great way for me to find a career and make good money.  I overthought it however.  They say its physically demanding, and dangerous.  I got scared away and discouraged by family and friends.  So I guess I wanted to find a job I enjoy which ended up being Trader Joes.  I really do enjoy this job for the most part.

If you're dealing with snoring, one of the main culprits could be your sleeping position. Experts say that snoozing on your back can cause your throat muscles to relax and lead to those dreaded snores. As you drift off, the soft tissues in your throat can collapse and narrow your airway, causing that annoying sound. Plus, if you're overweight, drink alcohol, or smoke, these factors can make snoring even worse, making it hard to catch some quality Z's.\n\nBut don't worry, there are ways to tackle this issue head-on. One straightforward solution is to switch up your sleeping position and try sleeping on your side to keep your airway open and reduce snoring. You could also use a specially designed pillow that helps keep your head and neck in alignment, making it easier to breathe throughout the night.\n\nIn the end, it's all about understanding how your sleeping position can affect your snoring and overall sleep quality. You could use a body pillow to maintain the right position or even sew\/tape a tennis ball to the back of your PJs to stop you from rolling onto your back. By taking these steps you could finally ditch the snoring and wake up feeling refreshed and ready to crush the day!","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678413455.0},{"title":"Am I emotionally unintelligent?","author":"ClerkEnough5235","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11nxrga\/am_i_emotionally_unintelligent\/","text":"I\u2019ve been told that I cannot put myself into other peoples shoes or respect other people as people.

I F20 have Borderline personality disorder (diagnosed at 18). I grew up very isolated from the world, my mother was an alcoholic and my dad was physically abusive and not really emotionally there. I had not a lot of friends growing up due to being socially underdeveloped (and undiagnosed autistic at the time). I was always told up until my senior year of high school I didn\u2019t respect others or their boundaries, not in the \u201cfuck you, I don\u2019t care\u201d way but in the id punch my friends too hard playfully, or say jokes that made them upset without realizing, or not making them feel seen or heard. \n\nI never realized this was a problem until recently but one of my friends asked if I can understand other people having thoughts, and I\u2019m like yeah ofc?? But upon really thinking about it I can\u2019t put myself into another persons shoes. When I see people cry I feel awkward or nothing at all, and when I really care about them I jump to anger. but I can\u2019t imagine other people having lives, complex brains, and personalities. The only time they really exist is right in front of me if that makes sense.\n\nAnyways, I\u2019m 20 now, and it\u2019s caused a lot of hurt because I apparently have tendencies to cut off, or hurt people during \u201cmanic\u201d episodes because I genuinely cannot grasp what I\u2019m doing is hurting them in the moment, and I still struggle to make others feel seen and heard. (Personally I feel it comes from always being forced to defend myself as a child). I always assume when someone is mad, or they need to talk to me it\u2019s something I did, or am doing and always get angry and defensive as a trauma response, and it makes people feel really shitty.\n\nUpon reading this does anyone have any advice?

It was joyous to me, as at the time, I was living with my mom and step dad, going nowhere in life socially or professionally. Finally I had something. My first year though, I had no car, and lived on a satellite campus with a shuttle that only went to main campus and back. Virtually no walkability and not much to do. I also have struggled socially with making friends and whatnot. When I started I enjoyed a honeymoon phase where I was high just off having my own place and having a sense of purpose in life again. It, however, didn't last.\n\nWhen the stress of school kicked in I turned to my lifelong habit of avoidance when it came to my problems. Neglecting school (always got most work done though), my living space (less of a pit now), and my health. I just resigned to getting high and not going to class, avoiding any chance to make friends with others and walking a solitary road. My dorm room became a symbol of where I was at my mom's, a room where I lived 80% of my life and sat in isolation. Remains that way still, though marginally less so.\n\nI spread myself too thin, leaving my advisor to join and work with other professors and labs hoping to research what I wanted. I didn't understand at the time that I not only lacked the skills for part of what the project I wanted required, but that just wasn't how grad school in general worked. I made friends, but alienated some of them with my behavior. One of which was seemingly permanent, the other has improved some.\n\nIn short, I was a mess, I was in denial about having second thoughts and lacking motivation, about my avoidance, my other personal issues I wasn't addressing, about my health (still a work in progress), and my habitual weed use. All of which held me back, caused my mom stress and created circumstances where she's had to financially support me, and denied me my true potential.\n\nI missed out on doing a thesis, possibly presenting at conferences, and maybe having a doctoral program or a nice job lined up after. Instead, I will graduate and move back home, moving back in with my mom and step dad, right where I started.\n\nI won't go as far as to say that this was a waste, it wasn't and I don't regret doing it. I am all fired up and more motivated to end the semester on a high note, and have some decent job prospects back home given I'll have a masters. As one doctoral student I work with pointed out, I am still kicking it. Even if I didn't garner the experimental research experience I wanted or needed, I didn't drop out like so many do. I have come to terms with my mistakes in trying not to compare myself to others, but this too is both new and difficult.\n\nWhile I am hopeful of how this semester will go, and may very well end on a high note, I feel disappointed in myself for not making the changes I should have sooner. For now not doing more to have given myself a better outcome. It didn't need to be this way, and the current trajectory suggests it won't stay that way for this semester at least.\n\nSo I don't really know how to feel. I have finally learned after so many painful lessons I failed to learn from earlier, and that is absoltely a positive. Still, I wish it came a year or so ago. I have shelved the PhD pursuit for now to work on myself and to get used to the flow of a job (hopefully one in research). In time I think where I wanted to be will come to fruition, and I am optimistic about this semester. Still, revelations about everything else leaves a lot to be desired in where I need to be.\n\nJust can't quite seem to come to a firm conclusion about what all this meant yet, aside from the issues that needed fixing.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678463080.0},{"title":"Books on self worth, independence and love","author":"Maleficent_Low1309","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11nsb6v\/books_on_self_worth_independence_and_love\/","text":"Broke up with my partner two months ago but I've been doing better so I'm very focused on self improvement!\n\nI have a great support system right now and I'd like to improve on my self worth and doing things on my own.

Because no one want to meet up outside this time frame for other activities.\n\nWhat about the weekend? Do people really need to do groceries on Saturday, can't they just do it on Friday night and then meeting up on Saturday day time would be possible (supermarkets are open until 10 pm here)?\n\nI don't even go to bed early, usually 1 am.

I was flunking all my classes, got kicked out of a student org after getting into a fight with a fellow member that I was seeing, was in a deep depression after a messy breakup (separate from the previous one), and had zero enthusiasm to do anything aside from sleeping and scrolling through an endless wave of shorts and videos. I never thought of ending it all, but a small part of me wanted to go all Unabomber and live out in the woods and avoid society for the rest of my life. It wasn't until I finally decided to go out of my cave and meet some really good people who gave me advice and opportunities, and I had one great friend who guided me out of the breakup and supported me in getting into a new org that I was recommended by another. In September I was able to get a good position in the org and was doing well in my studies, and I was also building a great network. Granted, there were a few problems on the horizon, as I constantly dealt with bouts of depression and developed a bad drinking problem, but I was able to at least keep those on the down low for a while. Then, I ruined it all.\n\nIn December, my drinking was at its peak because I was stuck at home due to snowstorms. I spent my spare time getting drunk and watching movies, and I'd usually be sloshed by noon. A few days after new years, where I embarrassed my parents by throwing up at a party after a good 12 shots of tequila, I got into an argument with a member of the org. I was hungover and it was really bad, and she was *really* mad at me afterwards. I thought I was giving some badass Walter White \"I am the one who knocks\" type of own on her, but in reality I was sounding like an asshole. Ten days later, I drunk texted her an unhinged 7 paragraph long apology, which prompted her to swiftly report me to the leads of the org, and that swiftly got me kicked out because what I did to her was on grounds of harassment. \n\nTwo weeks later, I lost almost all of my friends and was back to square one. The friend who had supported me was angry and disappointed, my mom's blood pressure shot up to hypertension-like levels because of my behavior, and my father started drinking again after 2 years of sobriety (thankfully he's managed it). I became a shut in again, and for the first time in a long time I contemplated suicide. I've spent the past 4 years burning bridges and doing dumb things, constantly ruining myself for no reason and being my own worst enemy. Yet, one chat with a friend that night changed things around. She was a member of my general friend group, which had become radio silent due to every member being busy, and was open on her struggles with depression. She told me about how she thought about killing herself a year ago, but decided not to because of a movie she wanted to see. That made me realizing that there are so many things I can look forward too. Books that haven't been read, movies and shows from the past and future that I haven't seen, experiences that are to be made. And I didn't want to add any more pressure to my friends and family. So, I chose not to do it. Life is so unpredictable, so many things can happen out of nowhere and you never know where it will go. The important thing is to savor and make the best of the highs and keep your head up during the lows and hope that everything will work out one day. It's been a month, and I'm doing better now. I won't deny that those thoughts cross my mind every now and then, but I'm in a better place. I've got my drinking under control and have started going to therapy. Things aren't substantially better, but I just have to know that things will look up if I just choose to work hard and steer clear of trouble.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678315830.0},{"title":"Greg is a dick.

But not going tonread anything written past the 8th grade reading level.  And especially don't do it for clout.  \n\nIt's OK to read easy books or 'popular' books you find on tik tok or Instagram (especially if you are getting back into reading) but please do yourself a favor and do the following. \n\n1.) Read a classic.  Bronte, Austen, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Twain, Steinbeck, Kafka, Kurt Vounnegut. They are classics fir a reason (currently reading The Idiot by Fyodor Dostoyevsky and fucking love it)\n\n2.) Don't read to hit a goal.  Read to learn or get something out of it.  Books were written first to communicate history. Then it was to tell stories were the author framed the world around their personal ethics, values, virtues, and beliefs.  I think there is a lot.less.of that now then there was even 20 years ago.  Though some stuff still shines through. \n\n3.) Don't just read self help\/ nonfiction books.  These are easy to read because there isn't a plot it's just a booknof information.  I read Deep Work by Cal Newport and How to Take Smart Notes in a weekend.  It's not difficult.  They are each like 200 something pages of just strategies on how to get stuff done.  Also how many books do you need to read to help yourself?  \n\n4.) Fiction makes you more empathic.  For all of you emotionally deprived people.  It could be because you didn't read enough as kids.  Not a big deal just start reading now.  You've probably got time and are able to read whatever book you want.  \n\n5.) Find your white whale.  Mine currently is 1Q84 by Murakami it's a 928 page brick of a book.  The next is the unconsoled by ishiguro, then the brothers kazmaraov by dostoyevsky. Find those books that you want to read but don't think you can and start chipping away at them.  Whether it be the entirety of the song and ice and fire series.  All of the lord of the rings books or War and Peqce.  Just find that brick that you are scared of and start chipping away at it.\n\n6.) Don't be afraid of genres that are not part of the gender norms.   Dudes read romantic Era novels and Shakespeare tragedies.  Ladies pick up that spy thriller or Sci fi book.  I know we are moving into a much more gender neutral state (for better and worse). And guess what. Dudes women like men who understand romances.  And chick's Dudes dig girls with nerdy passions. Also there are some classics on both sides.\n\nOverall pick up a book from your library, book store, second hand shop (recommend thriftbooks if you live in the states) or e reader platform and read just a bit more.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678412773.0},{"title":"Why I don't get girls ??","author":"lallan-pandey04","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11n1lwx\/why_i_dont_get_girls\/","text":"Me (20, M).

This is because reaching \u201cthe top\u201d is my goal in life. I want to see everyone there someday. However, In this paper, I want to explain the bottom. The bottom is where I am now, and it is where I will always see myself.\n\nI see humanity in a hierarchy. One with the best of us at the top, and the worst of us at the bottom. This hierarchy is one of value, not of power. In this hierarchy a person\u2019s value stems from kindness, morality, pureness of heart, the desire to do good for this world and having the courage to act on it. Things like money, power, and accomplishments have no value here. The only thing that matters is an individual's determination to be their best self. I view myself at the bottom of this hierarchy, at the bottom of humanity. I am lower than drug addicts. I am lower than killers. I am lower than rapists, terrorists, and dictators. I am the absolute least valuable person of all 7 billion people that live on this Earth. This is where I am meant to be, and this is where I will stay.\n\nI am surrounded by great people. Everyone around me is better than me. I know I am a bad talker, and if I talk the people around me will realize just how low my place is. They will realize how scared I am. They will realize I don\u2019t belong, and they would be right. I do not deserve to be with these people. I am terrified of dragging them down. I am terrified of tainting their greatness. I work hard to stay out of the way, and always take a back seat. Any involvement from me would make everyone else worse. I do everything I can to get by unnoticed and to never be a detriment. I keep my head down, my mouth shut and go to work. I do this with the hopes of tricking the people around me into believing I am equal to them. I hide my weakness behind my work ethic while praying that they will keep me around just a day longer. This illusion of goodness may work on them, but it does not work on me. I know my place, and I will not step out of it.\n\nThis view of myself at the very bottom of humanity is why I know I will reach the top. As long as I choose to place myself at the bottom, I will never feel good enough for the people around me. This feeling of having things I do not deserve is what motivates me. This feeling is the reason I get out of bed every morning. Everyday I try to grow as a person. Everyday I try to get better at something, anything at all. Everyday I try to make myself useful to all the people above me. Everyday I try not to waste the air I breathe. I am alive to serve. I am alive to do the hard shit that no one else wants to do. I dream that someday I will be able to give everyone the life they deserve. I will do all the struggling, I will do all the work, and the good people of this Earth will finally have a chance to rest.\n\nI know that as long as I stay at the bottom, the fire inside of me will never go out. I will strive to get better every single day. I will strive to prove my worth. As long as I am getting better, I will in turn make everyone around me better. I am at the bottom so I can push people to the top with me. I know I will reach the top someday and I try to drag everyone around me up too. I know you can reach the top too. Our minds are the only things stopping us from joining greats. All we need is the courage to fail and stubbornness to fail again. With this we may someday find that we have grown.\n\nI will see you at the top :)\n\nIt is now 2023 and has been a few years since I last looked at this paper. It is crazy to see how times have changed. I know longer see myself in the light that I once used to. I still see myself as a servant, but I no longer feel below other people. I feel as though I have the right to choose who I serve, and that my service is valuable. At the same time I still do not believe I am better than anyone else. We are all one bad decision from becoming the scum of the Earth and one good idea away from becoming a legend. In this aspect we are all equal.\n\nAs far as the great people around me that I talk about in this essay, it now seems that we mutually look up to each other.

I finished High School 2 years ago, took a gap year in order to work that extended to this current year because I didn't get accepted into college. I'll try again, but my grades are good enough only to scrape by; At work, one that I've held for 10 months, I keep making stupid mistakes, and I can't focus on it. I'm always forgetting to turn something on, which then leads to spoiled food, or getting overwhelmed by small amounts of orders. To make things worse, I feel like a genuine moron; I remember not being this ridiculously dumb, and I'm not sure when it was that my IQ took a nose dive. \n\nI don't smoke, I drink only occasionally and moderately, I've no vices of any sorts. It's such a shitty feeling to always mess things up, it makes me feel incompetent. Things that are obvious take me an unorderly amount of time to understand, when I know I could do better, or atleast, that's what I believed; With each passing day I lose trust and confidence in myself which only makes me mess up even more while overthinking even the most basic of actions. It feels like my mind is all over the place, while at the same time being completely static, thinking of nothing, only humming a tune once in a while. \n\nAll of this helps shape my perception of myself; I feel as if, even if I get into college, which is unlikely, I'll just flunk out and be forced to drop out do to my inadequacy. I was a completely average student in High School, good enough to pass every class, but not enough to get any good or even \"decent\" grades. Why would I even be able to survive college?

When we got to know each other he seemed cool and we made friends. When I was little I was unpopular and invisible, and this might have an effect, but I wanted to be extroverted around them to seem cool. This guy in particular I considered a good friend and tried to get him on self improvement and I discouraged video games and TikTok.  After a while it all turned around and he is mad when I try to tell him something which I changed in myself, when I saw he was bluntly scrolling through social media I'd say to him to stop, since I felt that would've helped me, but he would just be mad at me and make fun of me. After that I stopped trying to help him and didn't really care but he continued to make fun of me and he would make fun of things I said to him in private as a friend. He started being a very toxic person always trying to make me angry. It happened a few times where he was pushing me to the edge to beat him up, since I'm bigger then him. I figured I will stop responding to his existence all together since he has nothing good to say.\n\nNow, after a few days everyone is turning down on me. A good friend that came to class later in the year, I was first to comfort and no one liked him except me, now he tells me that I'm always wrong. First he said to me that I get angry very easily, I thought about it and figured I'm little too hyperactive and I do get raged up quickly (I'm not angry like I hate you, more of like I shout and similar), so today I tried to be calmer and I said to myself I won't swear anymore. Now that I've done that and try to be calm they are the ones who are doing those same things. And today I said to my other friend that I don't want him to do those things anymore and when he didn't listen I became a little rough and now he's angry at me. If I put myself in his shoes I wouldn't be as angry, it almost feels like when  your girlfriend is mad at you for no reason.\n\nDo I have low quality friends or should I search myself. How do I cope with being alone in the class, even being alone doesnt bother me much but these people come up to me and want me to speak to them but when I actually do they don't like it. I feel like I'm surrounded by snakes. \n\nAm I the problem or should I just let it go?

Not sure if this is the right place for this. Please let me know otherwise. \n\nI am 39 years old. I\u2019ll be 40 later this year. Please forgive me if any of what I am saying is unclear. I have been drinking. \n\nTo get to where I am going, I feel the need to tell you quickly where I have been. Quickly. \n\n2004. I was an anti-alcohol person before joining the military, as my parents were heavy drinkers my whole childhood. I served 10 years in active duty and the NG. Had only one deployment (unfortunately). But it was enough apparently. During that deployment I lost friends, and my fiance at the time. She cheatee on me. After my deployment I found liquor and cigarettes. Over the next five years of deployment memories, and after I was laid off from a long time job, I abused alcohol quite heavily. To the point where I was getting the shakes and having crazy panic attacks. This was the first time I would say I was depressed, and an alcoholic. The attacks left me scared enough where I was uncomfortable being alone. I never asked for help. This was around 2012, and at the time, the loweat point of my life. \n\nI later met someone who made me forget about my worries. I ended up marrying her, and we moved to Europe to be closer to her family. I was happy. Being with her made me stop drinking. I stopped smoking. I even started eating healthier, to the point where I decided to go vegan for five years. A complete change. \n\nBut it wasn\u2019t all smiles. And about half way through things were going sour. Fast-forward to the end of 2020 - I decided to go back to school. During the pandemic. She decided to concentrate more on her ambitions. We started to drift even further apart. \n\nSchool was important to me. I strived to maintain a 4.0. It was more of a pride thing for me. To prove that I had it in me. Was it worth it now? I don\u2019t know. \n\nSkip to 2022. About 10 months ago now. Which is wierd. She brought up divorce. And I agreed to it. A month later she has a new guy and moves with him. I can\u2019t help to think that she had cheated on me as I previously found clues in the end, before it ended. She would be the second one to do such a thing, but after seven years of marriage, it broke me. Completely. \n\nAt this time, I had many different hobbies and interests. \n\nToday, I live alone. With the exception of my dog (which WAS our dog). And I\u2019m miserable.\n\nOver time the thoughts made their way in. And I often can\u2019t hold back my feelings and tears. I did relapse. It was subtle at first, but now full-blown. I see myself drinking up to 3\/4 of a bottle of Jim Beam\u2026 in 6 hours. And now I buy a bottle every couple of days. I am not happy about it, and I see where this is heading. \n\nI received my first \u2018F\u2019 just last quarter, and had no choice to withdraw. That said\u2026 my grades are slipping. \n\nI am not suicidal. I am lost. Depressed. Lonely. And hurt. \n\nI do see a therapist. At first it was every week, and now every two weeks. But now I see myself postponing these appointments due to being \u201csick\u201d. I don\u2019t feel much better after sessions. \n\nI just don\u2019t have the passion anymore\u2026 for anything.\n\nI have lost interest in school (programming and photography), music (piano, singing, and guitar), video games, running (I was previously a very big runner), and working out. And, thanks to my ex, I don\u2019t have any friends. No on to talk to. \n\nI come home from work. Tend to my dog. And then I drink myself stupid while watching musicals or sad movies. \n\nI need help. I have tried to go a day without alcohol, but boredom\/depression\/ memories fly by and I fail. I forgot how to enjoy myself without it, or I just don\u2019t care anymore. But I need help. Which is why I am here. \n\nI need advice. What can I do? \n\nThanks in advance.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678401780.0},{"title":"Drift Off to Peaceful Serenity: Soothing Rain Sounds for Deep Focus, & ...","author":"kemetworks","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11n603l\/drift_off_to_peaceful_serenity_soothing_rain\/","text":"**Experience** the wonder of nature from the comfort of your home with Nature Monad. \ud83c\udf3f\ud83c\udf3a\ud83c\udf33","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678400904.0},{"title":"i\u2019m in a hole that i can\u2019t seem to get out of","author":"JDoomer990","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11mvt93\/im_in_a_hole_that_i_cant_seem_to_get_out_of\/","text":"i hate venting but i\u2019m out of options. \n\ni\u2019m 21 turning 22 very soon and i have zero direction or purpose in life. i worked for 2 years full time through 2019-december 2021 and have been unemployed since then living off what i made during that time. i used to go to the gym frequently and trained like an animal but i got really burnt out and quit going about 4 months ago to save on money and because i simply didn\u2019t enjoy it anymore, i told myself i\u2019d stick with it at home but that never happened and since then i\u2019ve just felt the most defeated i\u2019ve felt in my whole life. i used to enjoy playing guitar (a hobby i\u2019ve had for 5+ years) but now i have almost no interest in it or anything i used to enjoy doing. the only thing i actually enjoy doing is lying in bed doing nothing but scrolling on my phone (i know this is a huge problem but yet i make no effort to fix it) i still try to get out the house frequently and i see my few close friends i still have from school when i can and go for walks everyday but other than that i don\u2019t do much at the moment. i used to love having all this free time on my hands but now it just makes me feel so depressed because i know i should be doing something productive but i simply don\u2019t know what to do with myself. i just have no idea where to start in getting myself out of this seemingly never ending rut and i have absolutely no clue what i want to do as a career (something i\u2019ve never had a clue about since i was young). i\u2019ve lacked a strong male role model in my life since losing my dad in 2020 and i think that has had something to do with my decline, ever since that year my mental health has deteriorated significantly. any pointers would be greatly appreciated.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678377510.0},{"title":"How to become more attractive [male edition]","author":"evimogwai","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11lvju2\/how_to_become_more_attractive_male_edition\/","text":"This is inspired by the recent *How to become more attractive* post which has *so* many caring and helpful tips. \n\nI am however a mid 30s male, and even though I've been seen as attractive and even handsome (especially a decade ago), I have done very little to deserve or enhance it.\nWhat can I, and other males\/men\/male presenting people do to raise their attractiveness?\n\nThe only things I ever learnt were the basics; dress well, have a clean haircut, and a well paying career.\nFor women there's so much more, and maybe there is for men as well.\n\nHit me with you best tips!

I have stronger friendships now and I don't feel the need to constantly be in contact with them - we can go days, even weeks without directly talking and I don't feel any anxiety or self loathing for that. \nYet the main thing I've noticed is that my standards and expectations have gone up, too.\n\n\nBack then, I was talking to people who leant heavily on each other for encouragement and validation - and if the group didn't agree on something, the individual agreed with the group. I was unconfident making my own decisions and I wasn't comfortable taking action by myself \"just in case\" it went wrong.\nNow, I'm talking to people who are very supportive of each other & help grow each others ideas - and if anyone within the group disagrees with anybody else within the group, they say it just isn't their thing but that doesn't mean the individual shouldn't go ahead anyway. I am much more confident making my own decisions, I'm better at forward planning to figure out what to expect with those decisions and when taking action - even if it's only small actions a lot of the time.\n\nBack then, my standards for a potential romantic partner were:\n- average or slightly above\n- healthy\n- someone happy to fill the silences\n- someone to take a nurturing, paternal role in the relationship\n- someone who my parents will approve of\n\nNow, my standards for a potential romantic partner are:\n- attractive, but in a unique way which makes them interesting to look at, rather than generic attractive \n- healthy & with an interest in staying healthy\n- competent in professional settings\n- someone who understands the importance of gratitude in their personal and professional life\n- someone to treat me as an equal\n- someone with their own life\n- someone with a good foothold in their career & with longterm career goals & a plan to reach them\n- someone content with silences \n- someone who enjoys cooking as much as I do\n- someone who knows we're not going to be completing each other, but complimenting and coexisting with each other & growing together instead\n- someone who doesn't subscribe or cave to toxic masculinity and who isn't afraid of their own emotions & who won't expect me to bottle mine up either \n- someone who is invested in themselves as much as I'm invested in myself\n- someone who will be in a relationship with me because they want to, not because they think they need to be\n\nAnd I think that difference is just really neat.\nI enjoy my life, and I'm content with myself right now. I have an interesting career (I'm an artist and author), I'm learning how to animate, I'm working on finding a hobby I enjoy that *isn't* career related (I read, I write, I draw, I design... and all of it circles into each other \ud83d\ude05 but I wanna get back into nature photography and music), I'm taking small but consistent steps to overcoming my agoraphobia, anxiety & paranoia each day, I'm in recovery from eating disorders, and I love looking after my animals.\nAm I where I thought I would be at 23? No.\nBut younger me didn't factor in the amount of time healing, growing & transitioning would take. Younger me thought I'd be married and bored by now, too, or constantly hooking up for validation, so I'm happy I'm in a different stage of life than I expected to be at 23.\n\nNot entirely sure where I was taking this post, but yeah - I enjoy improving myself because it encourages me to improve my life, and in doing so, improves my outlook of my future and my view of myself.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678379905.0},{"title":"Seeking Advice: Dealing with ADHD and Intellectual Laziness","author":"Growth000","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11mwkrt\/seeking_advice_dealing_with_adhd_and_intellectual\/","text":"Hey everyone,\n\nI hope you're all doing well.

Zero confidence and assertiveness. Anxiety, and depression, been medicated since he was in kindergarten. He comes across as kind, gentle, and a good listener, which is part of the problem.\n\nThroughout our marriage, we've had constant issues because of his boundaries with other women. To my knowledge, it's not full-blown affairs (I've never found evidence or reason to believe it's physical), but there has been a string of situations that's allowed short-term emotional affairs to blossom.\n\nA few days ago, he said he was going to dinner with a few guy friends. Gave me a whole song and dance about who is going to be there and how excited he was. My gut immediately told me something was off, and I expressed this to him. He offered to stay home, but I really want him to form meaningful friendships...something he is lacking, so I encouraged him to go. As it turns out he was going to hang out with another woman solo. He keeps his location on, and I saw he was at the restaurant, but an hour later, the location was suddenly off. I called him. No answer. Ten minutes later he calls me and starts making up stories. Being lied to, and poorly at that, is so demoralizing. Another ten minutes later and his location is back on...but it's moving all over and ends up back at the restaurant.\n\nLong story short, he went on a date with this person, and they then drove around for a bit, hence turning the location off. He claims he made up a lie to get out of there and came home. (he did come home earlier than he said he would). He's never gone this far before. I confronted him, as he's terrible at covering evidence and I found out immediately.\n\nIn the aftermath, we've had a few good conversations. The short of it is that he feels he has an addiction but doesn't know what to call it. It's not sex, it's more like the need to be validated and feel worthy, over and over. Women are more open with their struggles and disclose emotionally, allowing him to be the \"good listener\" and feel important. He said, \"it's not that I need it specifically with women, it's just easier to connect with them\". This tracks. When he's had male friends that have opened up, he's the same way with them, but he seems to find it really hard to make male friends.\n\nI should add that we moved across the country last year and have zero community here, so we've both been struggling.\n\nI've tried to word this objectively, but truth be told, I feel broken and sick inside. I have had my own emotional safety and wellness put on the back burner over and over so that he can have these little moments, and it's made me unworthy and unsafe. Having the person you love lie to your face to go be with someone else when your yourself are starving for intimacy and engagement is devastating. When he's home, he often plays video games for hours as escapism.\n\nI know it's not me. His issues would follow him wherever he goes. I don't see a way forward because there is zero evidence that this will ever change, but I do want him to be able to identify what's happening and find a way to get better before it robs him of healthy relationships for the rest of his life.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678285420.0},{"title":"The Defining Decade by Meg Jay","author":"Glittering-Layer6887","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11mvi7q\/the_defining_decade_by_meg_jay\/","text":"I just finished this book called the Defining Decade.

Not too long ago, I was a fat, ugly, miserable little piece of shit who didn\u2019t deserve love or happiness, someone you could barely call human. That was what I would tell myself every day. And I mean. Every. Day. When I wasn\u2019t telling myself that I would eat away the pain or watch porn. I didn\u2019t realize it then, but that was pretty much my insecurities ruling how I lived my life. My brain accepted my own insecurities as facts, and refused to accept any of my better aspects.\n\nI was stuck in this infinite loop of self loathing. Then some things happened in my life, things I\u2019d rather not talk about. But when I was there, at one of then lowest points of my life, I discovered that it\u2019s okay to look up. You don\u2019t have to constantly keep your head down in shame of who you are. Your flaws are a part of you, but they don\u2019t define you. Personally I wouldn\u2019t recommend hitting rock bottom before coming to this conclusion, but ultimately it\u2019s your choice.\n\nConfidence isn\u2019t something you obtain from outside sources, but something you create within yourself. In the end, it really is just a mind game. You have to make yourself believe you\u2019re the shit, because the truth is you are. And the sooner you accept that, the sooner your life will start to turn around. \n\nNow when I describe myself, I think of myself as a kind, genuine, thoughtful, hilarious, strong, resilient, capable, honest, hilarious, accepting, brave, and did I mention hilarious yet?\n\nEither way you get the point. The sooner you start telling your self you can, then the sooner you will.\n\nNot sure if I really explained my breakthrough properly, but I hope it helped atleast a little.

These are all things that I\u2019ve incorporated into my daily routine and have seen a noticeable increase in my focus, attention, and energy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Take a cold shower in the morning.** Cold water exposure results in elevated dopamine levels that you sustain throughout the day, resulting in increased energy and motivation. It also helps improve circulation and stimulates the nervous system. Switch out those hot showers for cold ones!\n2. **Get sunlight in the early morning hours.** We\u2019ve evolved over millions of years to naturally rise and set with the sun. Getting sunlight in the early morning hours - specifically, while the sun is at a low angle in the sky - helps tell our body to wake up for the day. As a bonus, it also sets our biological clock and makes it easier to fall asleep at night.\n3. **Stop doomscrolling on your phone.** So many people do this and it could be the single biggest killer of energy today. Our phones are essentially dopamine machines. When you become overstimulated with dopamine (i.e. the \u201cmotivator\u201d chemical), you become unmotivated to do anything else besides scroll on your phone. Get yourself a good screen time app - I use \u201cPresent: Screen Time Control\u201d because instead of app blocking it actually motivates you by turning staying off your phone into a game - but there are countless others out there. Find one that works for you.\n4. **Wait to drink coffee until 90 mins after waking.** Personally, I love caffeine, and I think most of the science says that it is good for motivation and focus. However, the research is clear: drinking caffeine right when you wake up interferes with your body\u2019s natural wake-up mechanisms, leading to that afternoon crash we all know. Wait at least 90 mins after you wake up for the first cup.\n5. **Practice deep breathing exercises.** Breathing is so important. It seems simple, but a lot of us don\u2019t focus on this enough. Deep breathing exercises can help increase oxygen flow to the brain and improve energy levels. Take a few deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth, throughout the day to help maintain your energy levels.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678295244.0},{"title":"How do I convince myself to start working?","author":"yellowpeanut22","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11mtkcp\/how_do_i_convince_myself_to_start_working\/","text":"I graduated high school about 3 years ago and have been sitting at home, just living off of my parents ever since then.

Even though we're friends, he's always struck me as a bit of a hedonist; he rarely showers, gets bad grades, and generally doesn't take care of himself. This never used to bother me until I started living with him. I told him about how I had a 120 day streak going on nofap, so he started showing me fucking hentai to try 'entice' me. First of all, what the fuck? We may both like anime, but that doesn't mean that I'm also into that sort of stuff. Secondly, what kind of friend knowingly tries to make their friend give into one of their vices? This was just one of many ways that he tried to stop me from bettering myself. Right now I have to study all of Algebra 2 to make it into precalculus next year, and the algebra 2 placement test is scheduled for just after this break. Basically I have to study a shit ton over this break to make it into precalculus, but he's made it really difficult for me. Whenever I'm trying to study, he constantly asks when I'll be done, so that we can play Apex Legends or some other shit. I genuinely don't understand how someone could view playing video games as equally important to their academic career, yet he somehow does. He's also one of those people who thinks that being racism = funny. We may both be black, but I still hate the fact that he calls me the n word with a hard r on a regular basis. That's also not mentioning all the things he says about other races. I'm still grateful that he let me stay with him, but part of me regrets our friendship as a whole. He's really fun to hang out with, but I think that the quote about picking your friends wisely may be correct.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678338157.0},{"title":"left discord","author":"Artistic_Ad_7332","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11mgdoj\/left_discord\/","text":"I mostly use discord out of all the social medias and I have just delete the app on all my devices and my accounts on discord and I plan to be more productive","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678329713.0},{"title":"Is it better to make it physically impossible for you indulge in instant gratification, or to have the ability to indulge, but resist the urge nonetheless?","author":"aTOMicbomb318","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11mmi4r\/is_it_better_to_make_it_physically_impossible_for\/","text":"About two years ago now, I completely deleted all social media off of my phone and made it impossible for me to redownload it, as well as restricted most of my access to it on my laptop.

IQ - Test was taken, due to abnormalities in behaviour ( impulsive, overly anxious ,  shy, rather inattentive and overly egocentric).\nResult was 113-114 (average). I was below average in pattern recognition (95) as well as detecting missing details on pictures (87), finding words with of same meaning  (94) and memory (94). \nI was above average in applied arithmetics (142), processing speed (137) and association (122).\nThe Rest was average.\n\nWhen switching schools (Germany) I got severely bullied in school (age 11-16). At this point I stopped learning altogether and my mental health is very bad ever since.\nNow at 23 I am a total loser, can\u2019t think straight anymore, can\u2019t solve any complex task and my memory has become so poor, I lose everything constantly (keys, headphones, smartphone). \nI basically didn\u2019t do a single intellectual task since ages and get kind of protected by my parents still. Meanwhile my sister studies at an elite University.\nI know now, that environmental factors, education and mental health in particular, do play a large role for developing your IQ during adolescence. I am so regretful about not knowing about this earlier. Every test I participate in nowadays, leaves me at around IQ= 95 or Sth. I can\u2019t grasp on the simplest of concepts and despite being able to read rapidly, I can\u2019t memorise a thing. It vanishes in an instant. My vocabulary is pretty compromised too (mother language: German).\nEveryone of my peers seems much brighter in comparison now, than at let\u2018s say at age 9. I consider leaving my gf, because of this constant feeling of being inferior (her IQ is 118).\n\nI really am super depressed due to this, especially since now as an adult, my brain power is set in stone.\nI just wish, that I was never bullied, consequently neglecting all my education, social life and brain engagement. \n\nI know it is likely a lost cause at my age but is there a way of recovering some of the lost iq points?","upvote_ratio":0.33,"created_utc":1678319532.0},{"title":"I did my mile and weights","author":"SoftBoiledPotatoChip","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11m5snd\/i_did_my_mile_and_weights\/","text":"Counting calories has been a little tough.

I stopped going to bed on time, I\u00b4started fapping again and I just don't do any good habits anymore. This has been like this for 4 days now and I just feel horrible bro\n\nTomorrow I want to meditate again and I finally want to be the best version of myself again, because I just can't live like this. If I kept doing what I'm doing right now I'd feel absolutely horrible in 3 weeks. I can't let that happen. \n\nI used to structure my days with a pretty strict routine and it worked insanely well, but now I stopped following it because \"I cAn'T dO It ANyWaYS\" and it's just a stupid excuse now that I think about it. I don't want to feel the way I'm feeling now so I'm changing it and I'm going to bed early today. Tomorrow morning I will finally meditate again, I even noticed that my brain started doing it by itself and it just went into an absolute flow state before I went to bed yesterday, so at least that's still working I guess\n\nI made a new routine that I can follow without doing sports everyday the way I used to and it focusses quite heavily on studying, improving skills and doing things that I \"didn't find the time to do\" before.\n\nI'm actually grateful that this happened to me because now I can improve my skill of getting back on track and now I can actually learn from it. I also realised that my life is only worth living when I cut out instant gratification, I work hard and I do things that I'm actually proud of.\n\nThanks for reading so far, I actually appreciate it.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678301250.0},{"title":"Huge dilemma going on","author":"NewLifeMarx","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/selfimprovement\/comments\/11m2s2n\/huge_dilemma_going_on\/","text":"I'm 16 years old. I recently started my self-improvement journey by doing activities like meditating and cutting out almost all of the bad habits. I was going through day 8-9 when a friend of mine talked to me about a videogame he was playing. I've never really been into videogames but this time I had an urge to play. Not an instant urge, but a long, well-thought urge. I had this thought in mind; I'm young. I really need to try and explore things before I enter this monk mode life. Self-improvement has to be good, very good, but I also need to try a lot of kinds of satisfaction (not talking about excessively bad things like drugs, mostly talking about videogames and youtube). So I started playing some videogames. Then it quickly escaleted into me being no longer on self-improvement. I was watching porn again and being on my phone for 4 hours. Now I have two options:\n\nTry my best to keep a balance between instant gratification that I really want to try (playing videogames)\n\nOr go full onto self-improvement, which would be good but I would feel like I'm missing out too many things.\n\nAnother problem I have with self-improvement is that, after I stopped being on it, my happiness quickly downscaled. This would be normal because of the bad habits, but it would take more than a while to downgrade my happiness. I think it happened because serious, hamza-style self-improvement can make you have a conditional happiness. This means that all of your happiness will always be based on doing the good habits. Self-improvement should mean getting a strong mental health capable of supporting some days of bad habits, but that's not what happens. As I do not know a lot about it, all I want is a bit of advice.

I am pushing through hard tho. I would love any advice on my venting. I just really need to get this out tho.\n\nSat on the edge of the roof of my office building, wondering if I should push myself over. I DIDN'T. What I did think about is how I want to be able to date, and take a girl on fun dates, be a part of her life, sex obviously, cook for her, be her hype man. All things I am not able to do currently. My fool's dream is to be married someday, and I wanted 2-3 daughters \n\nCurrently I am losing hard. I have some positives in my life like I am about to finish grad school and excited to finally start a career but negatives as well like being a dateless virgin at 25, whos fat and short. \n\nI am busting my ass lifting, dieting, but again its a really slow journey. Im a dateless virgin but I am not anti social I just lack game and good friends who would hype me up. I have 2 good friends now who I love and I hang out with them and their gfs a lot. I love cooking for them, and hanging out with them and making them happy. Also never gotten a match on any dating app.\n\nSorry point of my vent, I ruined my teens and 20s, I should've put more into losing my virginity because now I am basically unwanted goods being a virgin at my age. Guys are meant to lead, if I ask a girl to lead my first time that social suicide. I am gonna take the next year to focus full on my therapy sessions, gym, diet, fashion, 2 friends, and career. \n\nFrankly I am hoping some girl drops her standards and gives me a chance after a few years. I honestly don't know if I have any qualities a modern girl will want in a boyfriend but I am gonna try to focus on me the next year be the best me and maybe someone down on their luck gives me a chance(one they won't regret btw).\n\nTL:DR: I almost ended it yesterday but stopped myself because I still hold out hope of having kids and a family someday. I am fat, virgin loser but things look up because I am finishing school and plan is to solely focus on my body and mind for next year. Hopefulyl some girl can drop her standards for a guy like me.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678297243.0},{"title":"Who is a better written character and who is a better role model?
