Exam is normal aside from decreased axillary and pubic hair.\n\nAnswer on uWorld was confirmatory testing for primary adrenal insufficiency. Detailed nutritional history and trialing an antidepressant were other choices. \n\nJust thinking here, the salty craving (mineralocorticoid deficiency) and decreased axillary and pubic hair (androgen deficiency) are really the biggest clues to PAI here. I feel like in real life practice, a patient may easily not include the salty food habit (are we supposed to ask?) and also let's be real, most young people are shaving their pubic hair and women shave the pits. \n\nJust a preclinical student that has not done any rotations so genuinely curious how this plays out in clinical practice.",

Essentially, I was given near honors for a rotation, which is a great grade, but when I calculated my grade using the numbers they assigned, it ended up being exactly honors. I just met with the clerkship director and she disagrees that \n(2/3)94 + (1/3)85 = 91. She thinks it equals 90.9, which makes me near honors. However, she is using 0.666 instead of 0.667 in place of 2/3. So the grade, calculated her way, comes out to 90.990. Which is not honors, according to her. I sent a lengthy email to her and the other clerkship directors explaining the math and significant figures and how using 0.666 and 0.333 does not calculate 100% of the grade. \nI feel like I’m going crazy. I don’t know who to appeal this to. This probably feels silly to most since I did still get a great grade. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because I am so grateful. I just can’t believe Im having to explain this math to people. Any insight or advice is appreciated. My deans have not been super helpful.",

Taking step 1 after 2 years of classroom instruction is not the same. Sounds a little too much like NPs who say they are “board certified in emergency medicine” after their 24 month course.",

Basically everything rides on Step 2CK outcome.

But then sometimes I think I'm doing a disservice to myself because I know I would be a great surgeon too, I love the adrenaline. But gen surg lifestyle is so insane. I wish people also didn't look 'down' on family medicine doctors.  Like they have to know everything??? They are smart. And money is something I care about because again, humble beginnings, I got people to feed you know.

I've seen futile peds trauma codes, family being told their loved one had a brain bleed and won't leave the hospital and plenty of the standard deaths, and sometimes I've taken a minute after to cry, or on the way home, but it's always been because of the drama of the family reactions, not the incident itself.\n\nToday though, from something I thought would be rather benign (circumcision), I had to leave, get in my car, and fully broke down. I thought from the description that the dorsal nerve block would be the only unrest for the patient, but as soon as the first hemostat clamped the patient cried out like I haven't heard. I kept my shit together until they secured the whatever device and waiting for hemostasis before cutting, but when my attending started asking if I had questions they could tell I wasn't okay and let me leave. \n\nThey were clearly in pain. They had no way of understanding what's going on or why. It wasn't necessary. I don't see how it can't be a trauma for them. I think my reaction even lends weight to that. As a circumcised male I've always thought it looked normal and made sense, but I immediately had such a visceral feeling that I can't explain, and then that my own looked weird and I even felt some shame.\n\nMy attending offered to debrief at the end of the day, and they did okay for most of it, but then I just felt they were patronizing me (\"you were really mature; your showed you could keep calm under emotional stress\"), and then justifying their practice of the procedure. That last part pissed me off. I didn't criticize doing it; I had a fucking traumatic response. I don't need to hear you justify why you do it. It's not fucking relevant.\n\nAnyways, that combined with poor sleep the night before and some accompanying good stress (but stress nonetheless), I found myself approaching anxiety tonight while being so tired by body is trying to pass out by then not quite hitting it as anxiety kicks in and images from the procedure flash up, and if I think on it more than a second I start crying again. And now anxious knowing I'll get less sleep again when I'm already in a deficit \n\nI'm sure someone will give me shit for losing it over a \"minor\" procedure, but I don't give a fuck. I don't know any other procedure that doesn't fit the model of beneficence, nonmaleficence, and autonomy. And I didn't choose this response to fuck up my day, just like the patient didn't choose to have it done.\n\nEnd rant.",

I just thought I would share some helpful info on if you are thinking of buying a home in residency what you should be thinking about to get prepared!\n\nJANUARY (NOW)- Get an \"estimated\" loan prequalification from a national physician loan lender that can do a loan no matter where you match to. You give them one of the mid range salaries of where you match to (Eg ~57,000) and they can start to ballpark what your monthly payment is so you can see if buying even is a possibility at all. You also want to do this to check your credit and make sure there is no fraud. Credit Karma only pulls from one of the big bureaus, a mortgage pulls from all three, and you don't want to be blindsided with a low credit score and not have time to fix it. You need on average a 720 credit score to get a physician loan (some go down to 680 but rates are not as good). Pulling your credit will only knock your score down 5-10 points. By the time you have it re-pulled for the final loan approval after match day it will have come back up. Increase your credit by keeping you credit card usage under 30% (800+ scores only are using 7% of credit card available credit at any given time).\n\nFEBRUARY: Educate yourself on the different types of mortgage loans. Conventional Physician Loans, Normal conventional loans. FHA, VA, USDA. Learn how to shop mortgages so you don't get one that sticks you with mortgage insurance since we can get away with not having that as physicians if we find the right bank. Learn the difference between a fix and adjustable rate mortgage (ARM). A lot of residents do  a 10 year ARM because they usually move/sell their home they lived in during residency within 10 years. The ARM option gives a lower rate/payment during residency which is nice when cashflow is tight.\n\nPHYSICIAN LOAN BASISCS PERKS:\n-Can do 0% down. Rates get better if you have 5%,10% or 20% down.\n-Don't factor in our student loans to debt ratios.\n- Offer 30 year fixed and ARM options. The 30 Year fixed options are 05.% more in rate. Today rates are sitting at 5.5% for a 7/1 ARM physician loan and 6% for 30 Year Fixed.\n- NO MORTGAGE INSURANCE. The real physician loans have no mortgage insurance. Every bank out there will say they have a No Mortgage insurance physician product. 90% of the banks out there just have creative marketing and say they don't have mortgage insurance but they wrap in the mortgage insurance into your rate by increasing it 0.5% (it is called lender payed mortgage insurance). The real physician loans have the lower rate AND no monthly mortgage insurance. This is why it is important to shop around and compare mortgage rates to make sure you are not getting the \"marketed\" physician loan product and missing out on the \"real\" one.\n-Some physician loan companies will also allow the seller to pay for all your loan closing costs. I have helped residents get into a home with $0 out of their pocket at the end of the day. Meaning you only need like 5-10K to your name to get into a home if you want to.\n\nMARCH: Successfully Match! ￼​ But also, Contact your program coordinators to get your contract going. Find a local realtor that specializes in residency relocation and physician loans so you don't get screwed. Update your \"estimated\" prequal with the real numbers and shop for loans. Get at least 1 physician loan quote, at least 3 total quotes. You don't have to use the loan person you got prequalified with.\n\nAPRIL-JUNE: Put offers in on homes.\n-Can buy a home 90 days before residency contract starts. Most paychecks don't come until mid July, so If you don't want to stress about making a payment until August 1 you will want to get under contract in May, Close in June (30 days to close a loan after you are under contract). Get to skip July payment and first payment would be August.\n\nJULY-JULY SURVIVE INTERN YEAR.￼​\n\nHope that was helpful!\n\nMay the odds be ever in your favor.",

        "text": "I’m generally supportive of schools withdrawing…didn’t realize the general public felt so different. Comments are depressing. \n\n[Article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/medical-schools-bail-on-academic-merit-and-intellectual-rigor-us-news-rankings-diversity-equity-inclusion-race-students-11675005330)\n\nFull text: \n\nTo see how the diversity, equity and inclusion mania is colliding with meritocracy in American higher education, pay attention to the flap over graduate schools pulling out of the U.S. News rankings. Readers who aren’t applying to medical school may have missed the controversy. But anyone who plans on seeing a doctor or benefiting from research or treatment at an academic medical center has an interest in the outcome.\n\nSo far, U.S. News has resisted demands from the graduate schools to base the rankings on equity rather than on the grades and test scores of incoming students. U.S. News has been transparent about the method it uses for its rankings, including factors such as a reputation survey, MCAT scores and grade point averages of incoming students.\n\nThe medical schools have been similarly clear about why they disagree with the U.S. News method and will stop participating. The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in a Jan. 24 statement, said the U.S. News rankings undermine the school’s “commitment to anti-racism” and “outreach to diverse communities.”\n\n“Diversity, equity and inclusion are important factors in our decision,” the school’s deans, Dennis Charney and David Muller, said. “We believe that the quality of medical students and future physicians is reflected in their lived experiences, intersecting identities, research accomplishments, commitment to social and racial justice, and a set of core values that are aligned with those of our school.”\n\nThe statement went on, “The U.S. News rankings reduce us to a number that does not do justice to these profoundly important attributes, instead perpetuating a narrow focus on achievement that is linked to reputation and is driven by legacy and privilege.”\n\nThe dean of Stanford Medical School, Lloyd Minor, made a similar claim, announcing that instead of participating in the U.S. News rankings, the school would start issuing its own data “emphasizing diversity, equity, and inclusion.”\n\nA Jan. 24 statement from the dean of the medical school at the University of Pennsylvania, J. Larry Jameson, complained that the U.S. News rankings “measure the wrong things” and “encourage the acceptance of students based upon the highest grades and test scores.” He then went on to say that “the Perelman School of Medicine aims to serve the needs of a changing world, including diverse communities and stakeholders.”\n\nThe dean of the Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University, Katrina Armstrong, explained her medical school’s decision to pull out of the rankings, saying that the “focus on standardized test scores comes at a time when it is widely understood that prioritizing these scores rewards well-resourced applicants without regard for selecting the individuals who can best serve the future needs of a diverse and changing world.”\n\nThe context of this is a Supreme Court majority that appears skeptical of the claim that test scores and grades may be downplayed in admissions in the name of diversity without unlawfully discriminating against Asian-Americans, who tend to do better on the tests.\n\nU.S. News already does provide a list ranking universities that have the most racial and ethnic diversity among students. The medical school deans and the activists pushing them, however, apparently won’t be satisfied until test scores and grades are totally eliminated from the rankings, replaced by a commitment to anti-racism and diversity, equity and inclusion, which are less easily quantified.\n\nWhen colleges started making the SAT optional, some of us shrugged and said, well, that’s fine, so long as they don’t eliminate the tests for would-be brain surgeons. Now the battle lines have shifted in the meritocracy wars so that it’s precisely would-be brain surgeons whose test scores the medical schools want to conceal.\n\nThe businessmen for whom these medical schools are named—Carl Icahn, Raymond Perelman, P. Roy Vagelos—could never have amassed the fortunes they did if they ran their companies based on vague diversity commitments rather than quantifiable financial results.\n\nNot everyone wants to be ranked: Producers of Hollywood bombs sometimes decide not to hold press screenings. Book publishers have declined to provide early review copies. Chefs have withdrawn from the Michelin guide for restaurants.\n\nBut the U.S. News fight goes beyond that. It exemplifies a debate about the definition of excellence. Is the measure of quality doing better in school and on tests? Or is it having the correct representation of skin color, suitably impoverished background and ideological commitment?\n\nSure, being a good doctor is more complicated than a test score. Softer skills, such as empathy, listening and relationship-building, matter. But advances in health and high-quality care also depend on measurable intellectual rigor. If that is abandoned in favor of trendy ideological conformity, the consequences for higher education, for patients and for the nation could be deadly.",
