When we got there, she had her nephew so me and Ethan (the nephew) hanged out and had fun for most of the week.\n\nSo on the 5th day, me and Ethan we just messing about in the backyard, sucking on our ice-pops. And you have to understand that backyard wasn't a fenced in backyard, it was more of a large gravel driveway attached to an alleyway with more gravel driveways, on the left side was a tree and knee high grass and on the right was a tall wodden fence.\n\nSo anyways, here we are eating ice-pops, and all of a sudden, about 2 feet away, a black blur comes running past us. Be both saw it, and we both saw it running away. But It was running too fast to tell what it actually was.  We searched all around, and asked around to see if anyone saw it. No one did.\n\n\\*correction: Title is meant to be black blur",

Then, an intense but muted ringing sound. Like hearing a siren inside a bathroom. I can feel the ringing but the sound is dull. The strangest part happened when I tried to move my hands. I thought it was just sleep paralysis and I just need to wiggle my fingers to snap out of it. Instead, I realized I can move my fingers. I held my hands up to my face and get this: I SAW THROUGH MY EYELIDS.\n\nNo shit. Everything was covered in a thin, flesh-colored film. My hands weren't hands, but WAVES. It's hard to describe but think of graphic boards stacked against each other and corrugated like steel. The sight blinked for a couple of seconds before I was able to stretch out and go back to normal.\n\nI don't think it was paranormal, unlike sleep paralysis.\n\nTLDR: HANDS BECAME WAVES",

He had a town house in a neighborhood that had a huge field beind it that I would play in when I would go over. One day out of the blue a very large bamboo patch popped up. The bamboo was decently tall, the patch was dense enough I couldn't see any light through it, I am aware that bamboo is a plant that grows fast and likes to take over quickly, but this appeared within a couple of days. I thought nothing about the bamboo and went down to it to explore, I ripped some of the bamboo out and took it back to my grandfathers. A couple days later my mother brought us back, I went to visit the bamboo patch which was just completely gone with no evidence of bring ripped out from the ground and to this day it still confuses me as to what the hell happened with the appearing and disappearing bamboo patch.

In Birmingham, England in 2009 or 10 me, my sisters and our friends were playing outside then this flash of yellow came directly in front of us. The strip of light was long and a hazy yellow colour. We ran back to our house and the yellow strip closed in. When we opened the door it stopped. To this day my sisters still remember this happening yet when I asked people in my class about it they thought it was lying as many of you probably do now. I swear I am not lying. I made a Reddit profile just for this.",

        "text": "Long post so here’s the TL;DR up front.\nMinor things at work keep changing slightly.\n\n\nI’ve considered posting this a number of times but always stop half way through. I work as an operations manager for a major big box retailer, and last year transferred stores from the mid-west back to the East Coast where I’m from. Since I’ve been in my new store I’ve experienced a number of weird occurrences while at work there. Individually they can probably be explained or at least justified, but I think so can most glitches that we make our minds justify as having rational explanations. They’ve stayed with me and I’ve continued to encounter new ones, so I figured it was worth posting.\n\nOur office areas have a four digit pin code to unlock. I typically just use my key, but most employees use the pin code out of necessity. We have a very tenured associate, ‘J’ who called for help getting into the office. She said the pin pad wasn’t working. A few of us came up and what we knew to be the code worked just fine. She had tried a different number at least ten times that she was adamant had always been the code and was denied entry every time. She’s been in the store since it opened 7+ years ago, and had never worked in another location. J was visibly shaken by this and swore that we were messing with her. She was so certain it had been changed in the last little while because she had used the door multiple times that day and had for years with the now incorrect code that everyone else remembered. These are not random numbers that are easy to forget. The code she remembered was two adjacent numbers repeated twice, the one everyone else was accurately using was the four corners of the pad. She still brings it up now at least six months later because she remains confused by it happening. Her memory remains of the old code up until that point, not an in the moment derp of forgetfulness. With over 100 of us working there, she’s the only one that maintains with full conviction that it changed.\n\nThe next glitch I experienced personally. Earlier this year, our HR manager ‘T’ was about to go out on maternity leave. T wasn’t due for another month and a half, but had some minor complications (nothing putting the baby in true danger) and her doctor wanted her on bed rest as a precaution. We talked about this on Saturday that Friday would be her last day until two months after the baby was born. Our group of managers talked about planning a special lunch for her last day. Thursday came around an I was joking with my store manager about if he was ready to start wearing two hats while T was out. He said not really, but at least he had another month to get ready. I was really confused and reminded him that tomorrow was her last day and it was news to him. I thought he was messing with me in feigned denial, but he and everyone else, T included, had no idea what I was talking about. We had had multiple conversations about it that I distinctly remember, but T went on to work almost another month before actually being put on bedrest. It nagged me the whole time that I remembered that already being a thing. She went on to have an adorable and healthy baby.\n\nThere is another one I am forgetting right now but I can’t think of it. I feel like it was the most striking one because it prompted me starting to write this last time. If I remember it I’ll add in the replies. Instead the last one I’ll mention happened this week and I’m not sure what to make of it. I was looking through my phone for the manager schedule to see who was closing that night. I wanted to message them with a question about something that had been going on. RIGHT then before I found it, I got a call at home from T (she’s back now) that she was closing and couldn’t get the pin lock off our trailer for the driver to pick it up. It’s basically an awkwardly shaped lock that fits over the ball hitch on a trailer so random people can’t drive off with it. Our stores use two different ones - one that only the managers at the store have a key to, the other that our truck drivers can access. I figured she was just using the wrong key but she was adamant that she wasn’t. So I drove out to the store (luckily I only live a few minutes away). When I got there, she had several keys that she had tried - her own, the driver’s, and several extra pin keys from our lock box. None of them worked. She thought maybe we had switched locks and forgot to change out the keys, as she had just used her key in it the night before and it worked just fine. I tried my key and the lock came right off. The other keys wouldn’t even fit in the slot, much less turn. On their own they looked right, and the number printed on them matched mine, but when I compared the shapes key to key, mine was different. It was very odd and I committed to having our maintenance guy look into it the next day. I left T with my key in case she needed it for anything else. The next day when we had him check it out, all of the keys matched, they all worked perfectly fine, and he confirmed that it was not a different lock. T either lost my key and wouldn’t own up to it, or it changed to match the other keys. Even if it did change, why did the other keys go from not working to working? Did my key and the lock share a glitch?\n\n I hope I’m explaining these all well enough without rambling too much. Thoughts?",

        "text": "This happened probably 20 years ago when myself and my brother were children, and I've avoided saying anything about it online for many years because I've only ever been mocked or disbelieved, to the point where I wish it had never happened as I'm now left with a memory which makes no sense and is just laughable.\n\nWhat simply happened was that I was standing in the back yard during a bright afternoon with my brother. We lived in a small terraced house in the UK, and so back yards are often very small and packed tightly together, so that all you can really see are the backs of other houses and their gardens. At some point we noticed that in the sky above and to the right of us, although not too high to be indistinguishable, was an old-style Volkswagen Beetle car. It was simply there, although I have no memory of whether it was moving or still. We just watched it, and there the memory ends.\n\nOver these 20 or so years I've had several theories of what we could have seen. As a child I had a book about hot air balloons which were shaped like things such as cartoon characters, although of course hot air balloons come with those baskets, which this 'flying car' did not. I also had the idea that maybe the car was simply a UFO, and that some slightly dim-witted aliens were trying to go about Leicester in the 1990s incognito but had mistaken the fact that cars in our world, especially old Volkswagen Beetles, don't tend to fly. However, I'm pretty sceptical when it comes to aliens. I've tried to research online to see if other people have had similar experiences, but had no luck. I've also brought it up with my brother many times (the last time being a couple of years ago), but he only acts exasperated that he has to keep telling me that he doesn't know why we saw what we saw. It doesn't seem to have bothered him to the same extent it has me, as I get bothered by the memory at least once every few months. Why did I have to see something so nonsensical? \n\nI've started to think that maybe the best way of understanding the event is to see it as simply a glitch. Not paranormal, but just a mistake we weren't supposed to see.",

Even if i were to challenge my memory due to over whelming physical fact before me, and wonder weather there were two switched for real or its just a false memory, there is no way in hell that it has a small button, with little hole on the side which had hot cold and off written on it, and id not remember it or not notice, this too was rather peculiar. So if it were this i would very surely remember it, and not the two switchs whos memory is very clear in my head. its name is national hairdryer 600",

Im currently at a site that I've been to numerous times. There are 3 buildings -2 across from each other and one on the opposite side of the block. Between those first two buildings there has always been a park. I know its not something that im misremembering or imagined because I had a tenant tell me all the fun he had there as a child and that he misses being small. I also would sit in the laundry room for my break which over looked the park and listen to music and browse reddit. There is no longer a park there. Instead of a children's park there are trash cans and multiple massive stone steps going up to god knows where since the third building is right there. I can't climb to check where they go since theyre behind a fence but I dont care where they go Im just interested in the incredible disappearing park. I just had my break in the laundry room and I was stuck staring at a damn wall and voila I decided Reddit should know. ",

        "text": "On 27 July 2018 my friend and I went to the nearest IKEA to buy stuff. After taking pics of price tags with warehouse numbers of all the stuff we wanted to buy, we go to the warehouse and take [this trolley](https://i.imgur.com/hFv7wZW.jpg). It has blue handles and [here](https://i.imgur.com/4f32jcm.jpg) it says \"max 200 kg\". We take stuff, pay for it, take it home, nothing interesting. The next day I exit my apartment and immediately see 3 children playing with a trolley. I look a little closer. It's the same trolley! Blue handles and \"max 200 kg\". Where did they get it from?\n\nAnyway, the kitchen is delivered. Then on the next day an assembler arrives and we find that some things are broken. Also he says my apartment isn't compatible well, so I decide to call IKEA and request a refund of the whole kitchen. Spent 47 minutes on the phone. The refund request is created and the kitchen is taken back by IKEA people. Then I get a call from IKEA: they confirm I can now get X amount of money back, but in the refund request there is also a mattress mentioned which wasn't returned. I say we didn't want to return any mattress in the first place. Mysterious mattress is deleted from the refund request. So what's the matteress, you ask? Well, the same friend I went shopping with had been complaining that my mattress is uncomfortable to sleep on so maybe we should return it and buy a good one. Later we were doing some cleaning and somehow found out that to sleep comfortably on this mattress we just need to flip it over. So no need to refund. Yes, it's IKEA mattress. No, there were no talks with IKEA about any mattress. On 5 August I went to IKEA to get my money back. Staff starts working on my refund requests and says \"your refund request also had some mattress by mistake, interesting\". Unfortunately, there is no more to share. In the end I got my money back. End of story.",

        "text": "...at 9 something in the morning my pops and I were on our way to get my laptop repaired. My parents live in a new development area, everything is flat like in the country, barely any trees out there.\n\nI’ve noticed a plane pretty close to the ground, thinking nothing of it. I continue staring at it for about 10 full seconds. It looked like it wasn’t moving....it looked like it was floating horizontally in the sky, just frozen ( not diagonally when they take off ). I instantly felt sick to my stomach, then hurried to take out my phone to record a video. I fumbled, took 14 burst photos accidentally lol, then finally started my video. Here’s the thing.....I’ve made a point of looking at the numbers counting up on that video, making sure it was recording. I was thinking to myself if I don’t have proof, people will think I’m nuts.\n\nMy dad didn’t see the plane, as he was behind the wheel. When we turned around the corner house and the plane was about to be even more visible, there was few seconds of invisibility because a house was in the way and once we’ve passed it....there was no freaking plane up in the sky!!! I felt shivers coming down my spine again....where did it go?! It sure wasn’t landing....the angle wasn’t right. But it also wasn’t tilted up slightly either, indicating a take-off. We were not driving in the same direction it was flying, so it couldn’t have been an optical illusion, or? Because otherwise, if we were going in the same direction, we would’ve passed it way faster! I decided to check my video,......only to find out that the part with the plane recording was gone.....and the part with me talking about the incident with my dad and him laughing at me, remained. \n\nI feel so crazy to this day. I know what I saw.\n\nThis wasn’t the first time I’ve experienced something like this. I’ve seen a weird, white hashtag-shaped object in the sky consisting of 4 separate skewed cross-shaped objects that interlocked themselves to assemble itself into a hashtag shape. Sounds hilarious, but I don’t know how else to explain it. This was less than a decade ago. I was also in a passenger seat inside a car that time, it was a gloomy, cloudy day...object was moving at a slow pace....there were a bunch of trees and houses in the way and it was appearing and disappearing behind the clouds, I’ve only had a few seconds to really look at it....I blinked like 4 times to ‘adjust’ my eyeballs and make sure I was seeing right. \n\nSober, both those times.\n\nExplanations anyone?\n\n——————-\nEdit: spelling.",
