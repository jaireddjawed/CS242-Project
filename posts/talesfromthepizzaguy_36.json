This individual works at a certain chain with the sody pops and red&amp;green logo (unsure if I can name names here). \n\nLike I said, the employee has open sores all over his body. Arms, face, legs, stomach, etc. He scratches them often, and even near the make area. I do not feel comfortable with him working so closely to the food preparation station or helping with such (and without gloves, of course). \n\nAt first I thought he was possibly on drugs, but he stated that he has/had MRSA--it was removed and that he's on the mend. It makes me very worried that he could still be contagious and spreading this to employees and customers. \n\nIs there anything an employee or even a customer can do to report this somehow and possibly cease his contact with the food? I'm also a little afraid we could be shut down for it.",

        "text": "Hello, TFTPG! I've been subbed for awhile but never made my own post. I'm using a throwaway so if my coworkers are on here they won't know my reddit username. \n\nSo, I've been delivering for about 10 months, but I've worked at PJs since 2014. I switch between delivering and working inside based on need. \n\nLast night I had to close, which I rarely ever have to do. After most everyone had left, I'd say probably 10PM, I had to take a run to a house I've been to several times before.\n\nI knocked on the door, and the same kid (teenager) that always answers the door steps out. Immediately he points a gun right in my face, right between the eyes. I didn't really react, I just stood there silently in shock. \n\nThen he puts it away, and says \"Sorry, you scared me!\" and I just stare at him. \"I thought you were my friend,\" he adds. I said \"uh, okay.\" Then he says \"Don't worry it's just a BB gun.\" \n\nI'd like to add here that it was really dark out, and they never turn their porch light on. So in the dark, it looked like quite the real gun. It was a small handgun type thing, and it had no orange tip. \n\nI asked if his mom didn't tell him I was coming, and he said no. Then he told everyone in the living room what he did and they LAUGHED. No one really apologized.\n\nI handed him the food and left, went back to the store, and told my manager. He called our boss and our boss called the police. I spoke to them about a half hour later, which is about the same time the shock wore off. I'm still a little anxious about it. \n\nI haven't heard anything back, so I don't know what they're doing with that family. But what the hell is wrong with people?",

        "text": "So, several months back, I posted a story about a new customer I had, who failed to answer their door, and called after I returned their food to the store. Although, not  before I accidentally discovered their house was converted into a large scale Marijuana grow house. \n\n\n'Failed to make contact with customer, but discovered their Marijuana growhouse'\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/471l5f/failed_to_make_contact_with_customer_but/\n\n\nWell, since then, this guy has been ordering twice a week. I've always remembered the address after my first delivery there. He orders bizarre custom sandwiches that are completely repulsive.\n\nSince he's become a regular customer, I generally try to get his orders out as fast as possible.  Even bumping him up on occasion. Even though his orders are usually for under $20, and I usually only get a two dollar tip after making the eight mile roundtrip! He did tip $3.50 one time. \n\nWhatever!  I delivered 90% of the 45+ orders he's made since then, on time over the last few months.  At first, I did this to make up for delay the first time I delivered there.  Not sure why I keep kissing his ass though, because the guy's about as friendly as a New Yorker on a bad day, He takes, sometimes, two minutes to answer repeated knocks. He comes to the door with a giant spliff hanging out of his mouth, and trimmings all over his shirt. He can barley even mumble a hello when he answers the door and I greet him. \n\nHe's got a borderline condescending demeanor. He's never thanked me, even when I tell him I bumped him up for being a regular customer.  (Sometimes it's the truth, sometimes it's just ass kissing that I do, when in fact, there's no other deliveries pending and I get it there in twenty minutes, but try to make them think they're special.) \n\nThis past weekend, it was balls to the wall busy. I work at an Indy, and I'm the only driver per my shift.  I have a large area I cover, part urban and part rural, with my furthest deliveries being about eight miles from the store. I work 11 hour shifts and take a 40 minute  break at the 6 hour mark, right before dinner rush. \n\nI finally got a chance to take my break. A bit later than usually.  As I come back, dinner rush has rolled around and I've got a quad.  About 25 miles roundtrip, between the four addresses spread out in every direction of our area. Sure enough, I notice Dr. Greenthumb has placed a delivery just after I went on break. It's now almost 40 minutes old and he's eight miles away. The other orders are 15-20 minutes old, and a good 10 miles back North from Greenthumb's house!  Shit! I need to put the peddle to the metal! \n\nI fly down to his place at about 65-70MPH, damn well risking a hefty speeding ticket.  and get there in less then ten minutes. His order is 51 minutes old. \n\nAs usual, the guy takes forever to answer the door. I knock three times. Louder each time.   (I've noticed he's installed motion censors at the beginning of his long driveway, so I'd think he'd know when somebody was coming?)\n\nFinally he comes lumbering to the door.  \n\nMe: \" Hi there! How ya doing today? I'm so sorry I'm running a little later than usual. It's been crazy all day.\" \n\nHim: No response, just a mumble of some sort.\n\nMe:  \"Let's see, that's going to come out to $15.25. Cash or credit?\" \n\nHim:  \"Cash. Uh, what's was up with the wait?\"\n\nMe. \"Yeah, like I said, I'm really sorry about that! It's been abnormally busy all day and you called just after I went on break.\"\n\nHim \"Oh, well, they should have told me when I ordered! They didn't tell me you were on break! That's not right.\"\n\nMe: \"I agree. I'm really sorry! I can't answer for my coworkers. There's eight of them down there, and they probably didn't realize I was out. I work eleven hours shifts and I get a half hour break, and sometimes people will call when I'm out, but my coworkers don't always know. Especially when it's busy in the store.\"\n\nHim: \"So you were on break? That would have been nice to know! That's really crappy, man. I order a delivery and you go on break? Common, I order all the time!\"\n\nHe then turns to his friend while counting out his money, a big wad of bills, and says \"What should we do for a tip? That was a really long time.  Really crappy service!\"\n \nFriend: \"Yeah, they sucked today. I don't know? It's up to you. \" \n\nHim: \"You know, I usually tip really good. But today, that was crap, man  So here, I'm only giving you one dollar. Remember this.\" \n\nMe: \"I completely understand your frustration. I'll try not to let this happen again, and I'll have a word with my coworkers about letting people know when the wait is longer than usual.\"  \n\nI apologize again and wish him a nice evening as the door slams in my face. ( But this happens even on the best days at this address) All the while I'm biting my tongue and being as calm and professional as possible, while my blood pressure elevates highly.  I don't let stiffs get to me, but when you're going to be cocky about it, like discussing how much to screw me in front of me, that irks me. If you want show you're dissatisfied,, than just give me the dollar, or nothing at all. and let me be on my way. I get it!\n\nI've been kissing this guys ass for month's since his first delivery got screwed up, and that wasn't even my fault! \n\nNow I'm contemplating. I'm contemplating what I could do, just to be a major league ass? Like if this customer pisses me off anymore? It would be highly unfortunate if the authorities got tipped off to this kind of thing.... Especially when it's less than a half mile from their station and the elementary school.  \n\nI'm not quite sure this guy is a legit grower, and for reasons I won't mention, I tend to think he isn't?\n\nI think it's crazy to order pizza delivery, or have any strangers come to your house if it's a large scale Marijuana grow. That's not something you want people knowing about, whether it be legal medical, or illicit. You're just asking to be robbed or arrested.  ( My state does have legal medical herb, but it's not as liberal as places like California where you can get a prescription for any ailment) \n\nAs a longtime Marijuana consumer, and an 18 year pizza delivery vet (how else could you get through the monotony of two decades of full time delivery? I have no problem with stoners, growers, the whole scene. In fact, it's generally  it's against my smokers ethic to ever get anybody in trouble with the law over dealing/using weed, but this guy.. I don't know... I think it might be fun to send an anonymous tip if I get anymore disrespect from this guy? It could make agreat Reddit Pro Revenge forum story, too.  \n\nDisrespect the pizza guy who busts his ass for you repeatedly for months on end,  wake up at 4am to the DEA busting down your doors with submachine guns and Glocks  pointed at your head.  Maybe shit the bed? Sweet revenge! \n\nAll you had to do was tip, and it probably wasn't a good idea to alert strangers to you're grow op, anyway? \n\n\n\n",

Still, I thought I would share my two favorite kid-centric deliveries:\n\n* I pulled up to the house, and two little boys are sitting in the bed of the pickup in the driveway. The older one looks up at me, then my car, and says, \"It doesn't look like the one in the commercial\" -- obviously, he means the ~~hideous~~ glorious [DXP™](http://imgur.com/a/Lr5K8). I gestured to my empty car roof and pointed out that if my store doesn't have enough toppers to go around, then how could we even afford a DXP? I ask the boys if their mom is home, and the little one pipes up, \"We have a baby!\" The older one explains, \"Our mom is in the shower. She had a baby yesterday and now we have a little sister.\" I said that she must be tired, and handed over my little clipboard for them to run into the house for their dad to sign. **VERDICT:** Adorable. \n\n* Yesterday I get a delivery slip with a message in the instructions: *13Y BOY WILL SIGN; GUARDIAN AT WORK*. So I resign myself to no tip and just go about shrugging through the delivery. A little ginger kid opens the door and, be still my heart, he politely asks if he can get his cursive cheat sheet so he can sign the receipt. This is a combination of words I've never heard in my life, and the situation is making my heart cramp. He comes back with his cheat sheet and nicely asks where to sign, and I gingerly point at the signature line. He thoughtfully and carefully signs as his playdate/bff looks over his shoulder. I ask what they're doing (because you always small-talk the customer) and the ginger kid matter-of-factly says \"He's playing Battlefront. I'm watching YouTube.\" **VERDICT:** No tip but really, who cares.\n\nNot the most interesting stories but, seriously, these are the interactions I remember way more than my bad interactions. Dogs, nice kids, and cute customers are the highlights of the job.",

Start walking to the door, it's getting stronger and stronger. I get to the door and through the window I see a bong and a few people having a good time. Knock on the door and this guy answers with a huge smile and asks me how I'm doing.\n\nMe: \"I'm doing great sir, last run of the night.

I really appreciate that sir, that's cool of you.\"\n\nCustomer: \"Hell yeah bro! Say... You wanna come inside for a bong hit?\" \n\nMe: *Hesitates* \"Yeah man, why not it's my last run of the night anyways.\"\n\nI walk inside and immediately everyone inside welcomes me and offers me beers, to which I decline, I'm not the biggest drinker anymore. They hand me a bong and it was like the episode from that 70s show [where kitty needs a cigarette and asks for a lighter](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CPrhjdmXjck). I had 5 lighters in my face. \n\nI take a little bong rip, didn't want to be rude, and they all tell me to finish the bowl. I tell them I still have another order to deliver to so I can't kick it too long, they all start laughing again and tell me to have a good night. \n\nAs I'm walking away the original guy who paid is like, \"Hey bro! Here you go!\" and he slips me another 5 dollars from the change I gave him at the beginning and says have a great night.\n\nAs I'm walking back to my car I hear through the open window the guy telling his friends, \"I slipped him another 5, that guy was cool.\"\n\nIt made my night.

The past few days I've just gotten accustomed to pulling down the street a little bit to hide my vehicle...but today I had the my first customer to say anything about my car. I kindly explained it was my grandmothers car and I'm just driving it until mines out of the shop...but I can only give that excuse for so long before the regulars start to catch on. \n\nIm sure the car is gonna see a lot of wear and tear since delivering takes a toll on vehicles...but I've vowed to try and keep up with the repairs and baby the car so it doesn't get too beat up. \n\nI'm also trying to be even more cautious about the sketchy areas at night...but I'm sure driving a nice car is even more reason to get robbed.\n\nAnyone else deliver in a nicer vehicle and manage to still make decent tips? I'm just hoping the tips keep flowing. At least the customers get their pizzas nice and warm from my heated seats =p",

We're already short-handed at my store and I was taken off most of my driving shifts and put on prep. I'm one of the only ones left at my store who knows how to do prep. It was supposed to be fairly temporary but my boss could never get anyone trained on it because we're an extremely busy store. In our 14 store district, in a fairly large metropolitan area, we have the highest sales (also the highest customer satisfaction rating!). \n\nWe have this driver who is an idiot, goes out and smokes weed, comes back even dumber than he was when he got here, has no respect for anyone, and absolutely awful with customers. He's had more complaints than I can remember. Corporate told my boss that he can't fire ANYONE due to our lack of employees. My boss hates this guy and ends up giving him really good shifts so that he's out on deliveries and not in the store.\n\nI work my ass off and get dicked on driving shifts because of prep and this guy, I finally was given a closing driving shift and was stoked even though it was just a Tuesday. My boss looked at the schedule and realized that he didn't have anyone for prep that morning so he switched me to prep and gave my original shift to this loser. That was the last straw. I gave my two weeks the minute I saw the revised schedule. My boss understanding of the situation but also upset I was leaving.\n\n*My boss is actually a cool guy, but he's super old and doesn't understand how important the drive shifts are for some reason.\n\nToday, my district manager came in to go over some rule changes. He was standing with me and going over some stuff while I was running the oven. Now it's Friday night so we're naturally busy. [disclaimer: here's the humble-brag] I'm kicking ass at everything, telling the new employee all the things she needs to do and/or fix while no one is paying attention to her or her rookie mistakes, getting deliveries out the door, and following these new rule changes to a t. The DM walks over to my manager and quietly asks (my ears are burning though and I listened in, knowing he's going to talk about me), \"Why don't you make Stryder the new assistant manager?! He's awesome.\"\nMy manger says something like \"He put in his two weeks.\"\nSo the DM runs back over to me and says, \"I hear you quit, what can I do to make you stay?\"\n\nWe were busy so we set up a meeting for Sunday before my last shift starts. So I might end up an assistant manager rather than just unemployed.\n\nTL;DR Put in my two weeks, got lucky, might get a great promotion.",

No biggy, I've been there multiple times at night with no problems. I get to the room door and notice that the room is completely dark. I had my doubts and then I had doubts about my doubts and knocked anyways. Noone answered. Knocked again and no one answered. So then I decided to call the guy. It rang a couple times and then I get forwarded to voice mail. Almost immediately after the call a guy comes from the side of the building and he's like, \"Hey dude, we're over here, come on.\" Of course I followed the shady guy to the side of the building and noticed no one else is there. Just a backpack and an empty ramen packet. That's when I knew I was in trouble...empty ramen packet. Now, my car is parked on the other side, in front of the building. The room was at the back of the building. He walked straight to my car and asked me to sit the pizza on the car. I refused and handed him the pizza instead then told him the total. He says, \"Aight, my buddies will be here soon to pay for it.\" I see a car come and figured that was them. Then he asked me if I had a cigarette on me. I didn't but had some in my car. I'm not opening my car with this guy around though. The oncoming car parked away from us. Then he asked me if I had cash on me. I told him that since it's about closing time we don't have much cash on us at all just change. That was a lie. I actually just made some change so I had $21 on me. Then he looked at me. I looked at him. I'm bracing for a punch. He walked away and said, \"Forget it man, you're too nice.\" Which is true, I'm a pretty swell guy. After that he told me that he was kicked out and has to do what he has to do, ya know? I gave him the pizza anyways hoping it'd make his night better and drove off as he went on to ask other people at the motel if they had cigarettes.\n\nTL;DR: Being nice spared me but I still gave pizza away",

God forbid I was gonna let them get away without tipping for the second time. As they opened the door, I could already tell she was gonna grab the order and just shut the door. So I was like, \"hey the receipt said you guys are gonna tip in cash?\". And then she said, \"Oh can I tip with the card?\" I told her she had that option when she placed the order, but now it was too late. So she said she'll go look for some cash. Then I heard a voice from a man inside telling me that they were gonna tip me 5 but now only 2 since I asked for a tip. I thought to myself, Bullshit! So I told him, hey the last time I delivered here you guys didn't give me anything. Then he got up out of the couch, and, yelled I ain't tipping you anything at all motherfucker! and slammed the door in my face. So I texted their number saying that I wouldn't deliver to their place in the future and that they could pick the order up themselves.\n\nAnyways, I feel like I was justified in my actions, especially since this is the second time I drove 20 minutes to their place using my car and gas, just to receive nada.

        "text": "My store recently switched to the \"auto-dispatch\" system and with that came the big stupid boxes that drivers put their cash and slips into.  Before that we would cash out drivers as they came in, now we do it at the end out their shift.\n\nMy store is crazy.  It's in a poor neighborhood and is all about quantity over quality when it comes to tips.  A good night you might only average 3 bucks a delivery, but you can easily do 30-40 runs in an 8 hour shift.\n\nBecause of this, and because it's a bad part of town we have an issue with keeping enough drivers.  There's a constant influx of new drivers that work with our vets and leg times vary widely.  Sometimes, hell most times we will get hit with a huge rush or two and our delivery times suffer.\n\nIf a customer calls the store and I give a discount, I enter that shit into the computer while I'm on the phone with them.  But if they call CSC and get a discount I don't know about it until I check you out at the end of your shift.  If CSC doesn't notate the ticket, unless you tell me I am going to assume the number on the screen is correct.\n\nI had a driver a few nights ago take an order that CSC comped but didn't notate.  Big order too, over 60 bucks.  My idiot driver never said a word until after I had cashed her out and then complained that she never makes any money.  The next day she tells me, \"oh, so there was an order that was cancelled, did that get taken off?\"\n\nLow and behold I pulled her ticket history and found an order that went out very, very late, called up the customer, and found out CSC did comp it.  Then I have to get the RGM's permission to do a cash payout for 60 some bucks so she get's her money.\n\nWho knows how many drivers get screwed over when the call center takes off a few bucks here and there.  So please, when you get back to the store, let your manager/lead/whoever cashes you out know that the run you had was discounted.  Or at least notate the receipt or something.",

        "text": "The AM (assistant manager) at my store has been stealing tips from the drivers, including me, for the past 2 months since he transferred to this store... \n\nI don't know how the tips work everywhere else but at my store you hold onto all of your receipts and cash until the end of your shift, give the manager your receipts, and they do some computer magic and ask you for the amount you owe. I noticed that every time the AM would clock me out I would owe an amount more than I should, usually around $10 extra. Well I count my tips as I make them, and I also get $1.10 per delivery, so I know what I am supposed to have at the end of the day. Last Friday I really wrote all my tips down and added them up and I was short $10 again. This never happens when the general manager nor the shift leaders ever clock me out. At most it will be $2+/-. \n\nWord got around with the other drivers and they were noticing the same thing. The general manager talked to him and he denied it completely. After some looking into it the general manager was able to determine that he was in fact stealing money from the drivers. He got fired today. Apparently his excuse to keep his job was \"Well I stopped after you told me!\" Because the last few nights the AM clocked me out, my tips were actually $2 more than I had accounted for.\n\nSo long story short, COUNT YOUR TIPS. I just figured I would come on Reddit to share my story in case it is happening to anyone else, as I was in disbelief that it was actually happening to me. You really shouldn't have to worry about someone in a management position stealing the money you earn, but the world will surprise you these days. \n\nEdit - Formatting",

We'd pared the list down from fifty-five potential names to four, but could not narrow it down any more. Further, we were hungry, and our vocalist remarked that he had not had a certain kind of pizza in quite a while and craved it.\n\nWe decided to tackle both problems at once—we would order the pizza, and in the delivery instructions we would list the names and ask them to pick one. Unfortunately this didn't work because the field wasn't long enough, so we did the next best thing and called them up, requesting that the name they chose be written on the inside of the box. The lady on the phone seemed like she was taken a bit off-guard by the request, but she wrote the names down while on the call.\n\nWe rehearsed a few songs while waiting for the pizza to arrive. It came, we paid the guy, he left, and I took the pizza into the kitchen. We eagerly opened the box, hoping that they complied with our request, and they did! In huge letters written on the inside of the box was one of the four names we were considering, which is now our name.\n\nI am very grateful to the local pizzeria for doing this.",

I thought I might share with everyone how laughably little these increases had to be. \n\n* Med and Large 1-top or specialty pizzas: $0.15 increase\n* Additional pizza toppings (all sizes) $0.10 increase\n* Sandwiches: $0.15 increase\n* All drinks (all sizes) $0.10 increase\n\nThat's it. And more than half the people in my crew are making about $1 more per hour (our drivers earn full minimum, not a tipped wage).\n\nAnyways, my point is, **don't let people push you around when it comes to this stuff.** Minimum wage is way lower than it's ever been based on cost-of-living indexes.  Is my store going to miss sales due to these tiny increase? I can't possibly think so. I can't see how this bothers anyone more than the minor inconvenience of a bit of paper work.",

Unless the parents were nice enough to give them extra cash at the door, and even then these kids won't give it to you sometimes. \n\nThe other day I delivered to a house where this young guy answers the door (like 13-14 maybe). Mom is sitting in the back, just kinda watching the transaction go down with a smile on her face. I give him the credit card slip, and before I can ask myself, she says \"ok sweetie now sign that for him.\" Like kind of trying to teach her son how to interact with customer service people (totally cool of parents to do that, I used to be a nervous shy kid back in the day). \n\nBut I can see she also gave him a 5 dollar bill he has in his hand, and all in one motion as soon as he signs the slip he hands it to me with his left hand and with his right hand he crumples up the five and shoves it in his pocket and says \"later\". \n\nThis actually happens more often than you'd think. Parents, if you're giving your kids money, tell them what a tip is. Don't just give them money and expect them to know they have to give it to the driver. \n\nOr expect your kid is going to be a little shit head like Liam. We have this guy who always orders, actually just yesterday he ordered. Apparently his son would pocket the tips when he'd pay, so now whenever his dad orders, he always tells us, \"Make sure Liam gives you that damn tip money too.\"",

But it's guaranteed to piss you off! \n\nSo last night we get a delivery to an address slightly out of our zone, but our store gets super slow in the summer so we make exceptions sometimes. Anyway, this person ordered to 1234 Blank Street, Building 2 on the 5th floor. So I figure, oh okay, it's an apartment at Building 2 on this road, and 1234 is the apartment number. Cool.\n\nSo it already took me 12 minutes to get there (like I said, out of our zone), and I realize 1234 actually was the building address, and it was a rehabilitation center. Fuck. So now all I know is someone on the 5th floor of this rehab center ordered food. Usually when this happens it ends up being a nurse, or a patient that notifies a nurse to be on the lookout for a delivery. So before I go in I call the number on the receipt. Invalid. Beautiful.\n\nNow before I go any further, I realize our store is partially responsible for not asking for more specific information like a name, or what kind of building it was, etc. \n\nSo I approach the desk on the 5th floor and there are three receptionists, but I only interact with one during this whole story.\n\nR: \"How can I help you\" \n\nMe: \"I have a delivery for someone on the 5th floor.\" \n\nR: \"Do you have a name or room number?\" \n\nMe: \"No I'm sorry, we just assumed it was an apartment complex or something, the person on the phone didn't specify any further. And when I called them the number was invalid.\"\n\nR: \"Okay.\" Now here's where it gets messy. She said it in a pretty ambiguous way, and I wasn't entirely sure if it was an \"okay I'll take care of it, just give me a minute\", or \"okay cool have fun with that bucko.\"\n\nShe was talking to the other receptionist right next to her, so I figure she's just busy and she'll help me in a little bit. Well a solid minute passes as I'm still standing there with my thumb firmly planted in my ass, and she abruptly raises her voice in the most patronizing way possible.\n\nR: \"Ugh, *SWEETIE*, I don't know what you're still standing here for, I can't help you.\" That really pissed me off.\n\nMe: \"Well they didn't give a room number so maybe it's just a nurse (this is almost always the case in my experience) Could you maybe ask someone? Or make an announcement on the intercom that someone's food arrived?\"\n\nR (visibly annoyed now): \"We're not allowed to use the intercom.\" Which is complete bullshit, I've literally sat and waited at several different hospitals/nursing homes while they did EXACTLY this. And even if you can't use the intercom, are you incapable of asking your fucking coworkers if MAYBE they know anything? What the fuck do they pay you for?\n\nMe: \"Well I'm not knocking on every door or shouting down the hallway, and I don't think you'd appreciate me doing that either.\" At this point her and the other receptionists just ignore me and talk among themselves. I'm absolutely fuming at this point. \n\nSo I go down to the first floor and talk to the receptionist by the entrance, and I explain everything that happened. She goes ahead and uses the intercom and says \"whoever ordered from (restaurant) could you please come down to the first floor, thank you.\" So I say \"I guess I should have talked to you first and saved time since only you can use the intercom\" and she goes \"oh no, all of the receptionists can\".\n\nUn-fucking-believable. \n\nI go on to tell her that the 5th floor receptionist refused to do that for me and lied about it. It actually did end up being a nurse who ordered the food, and she was just as confused as us as to why the receptionist didn't just ask around. As I was leaving the helpful receptionist assured me she was going to complain to the one who gave me so much trouble and made a phone call.\n\nSeriously props to the receptionist who actually had a shred of empathy. Just the complete lack of regard for drivers sometimes is infuriating, like I'm some fucking peasant who isn't just doing his job.",

I told him to keep working on the make line while I handle the phone and customers and text someone to come help us. In the 20 minutes it took for an insider to come in I had 2 people call for delivery and get pissed when I told them it could take up to 2 hours. I took all 5 at once and finally got back an hour before closing. I checked the dispatch and no deliveries. \n\nThat wasn't even the worst part of the night. About 10 minutes before delivery cut off we get a web order. We make it and I check out on it. I noticed that in the instructions that a second address was listed. I called them to see what was going on and they wanted it delivered to the second address. The second address was outside our range. I called my GM and was told that I could take it if I want, but I didn't have to. I had the closing manager call then back and tell them sorry, they can pick it up or meet me. They cursed him like crazy and cancelled. After an hour of both of us cleaning like crazy, and 3 people trying to get in a locked door we finally were able to leave.\n",

It's basically a sure fire way to know you're not getting tipped! \n\nAnyways I arrive at the address 1151 Jackson Ave, and walk up to the door with a pen and receipt. Knock a few times, no answer...knock some more, try the doorbell...no answer. I did this on repeat for a good 5 minutes it felt like, before I went back to my car and phoned in to the customer to let them know I was outside with their pizzas. They answer and say \"I'll come outside\"...so I walk back up to the door and wait patiently for another 5 minutes...\n\nAt this point I'm pretty aggravated and I knock some more...no answer. I look across the street and see a group of people and in my desperation I walked up to them and asked \"are you guys 1151 Jackson Ave by any chance\"...\"we're 1150, they replied\"...\n\nFML...I walk back up to 1151 and then knock some more before calling the customer again to find out wtf is going on. The lady answers and says \"oh we're across the street standing outside\"!\n\nI look over and the same group of dumb asses that told me they were 1150 Jackson are on the phone with me. I tell them that the address they gave on the receipt was 1151 Jackson, they reply with \"oh it doesn't matter, I must've put the wrong address\", then proceeded to stiff me before walking inside with their free pizza's after staring at me for 10 minutes knocking on someone else's address!!!\n\nTurns out...their pizza was free because the last driver never got anyone to answer the door or their phone!\n\nBut wait...there's more! \n\nI try to compose my hatred for stupid people as I drive up to the next delivery. It's a write in tip and special instructions say \"deliver to back house\"...\n\nI get out of my car and walk up to check the address and then head for the back house. I'm met halfway by some hillbilly looking man who greets me with \"why didn't you drive through the alley!?\". I explained to him that I didn't even know there was an alley...the instructions just explained to deliver to the house out back. I hand him the pen and he makes up a sob excuse that the pen isn't working...I tell him I just used it so he managed to get it working enough to sign his name. \n\nThis guy was a straight asshole...after scolding me about not going down the alleyway a few times he says, \"don't work too hard\"...\n\nAt this point...just for kicks...I realize he didn't fill out the total (and obviously didn't write a tip either)...so I kindly ask him if he could write in the total for me. He hatefully replied \"they told me the total over the phone, I don't need to do that\"...then repeated once again \"come to through the back alley next time\". This is the first time I've ever been fed up enough to not thank the customer, even when I'm stiffed I always say \"have a great evening\"...this time I literally just said \"ok\" and turned around and walked away. \n\nWorst double ever!",

I never know if someone is hitting on me (yeah, right, like *that* would ever happen to me) or really irritated at me. It's just, *woosh*, over my head.\n\n So I'm delivering to this apartment complex at the edge of our delivery area, nothing unusual. I go to the door, knock, and lo and behold, four pretty attractive girls open the door. They're all talking to each other, and pizza is traded for cash, and even a $5 tip, which is pretty big for my town. Then, one girl in the back asks me,\n\n\"Hey, are you a photographer?\"\n\n\"Wha...? Uh, no.\"\n\n\"Oh, I was just asking because I can see you and I together.\"\n\nNow even for me, this is like a giant flashing neon sign that says \"THIS GIRL IS FLIRTING WITH YOU\"\n\nAnd all I can do is... nothing. I just laugh a little. Then one of the other girls says, \"Hey, can we get a picture with you?\"\n\nSo I say yes, and next thing I know, I'm surrounded on all sides bu cute girls. It's like a dream come true for me. So I smile, they take a picture, and then the girl who took it gives me a big hug. And I'll be honest, this was the first time I hugged someone who wasn't related to me in a loooong time. Probably two years. \n\nSo I tell them to have good night, get back in the car, and drive back to the store. For any of you wondering, this is the wrong answer. The *right* answer is... other than \"don't be me\", I have no idea.\n\nI'm really considering calling the number on the delivery slip, but I have no idea what I would say.  \n\nSo yeah, this was the clearest shot I have ever had (or will probably ever have again), and I blew it. \n\nUgh, fuck my life. Can I just get a new personality, please?",

Call a couple times, leave a voicemail, nothing works.\n\nCall the store. They call the customer. No answer. So I figure, this is really fucking annoying, at this point I've probably lost ten minutes and a couple of deliveries since this was close and business was steady. Call the store again to tell them I'm coming back, the CSR says that sounds fine (she was talking to the manager the whole time too).\n\nI'm turning onto the main drag, where our store is, and the CSR calls. “She said she didn't think anyone had come but she will be waiting.” The fuck?\n\nTurn around, CSR texts me with info about cars out front.

My coworkers are awesome and even our GM is an awesome dude! Not too mention I get pretty decent tips with the hours I get!\n\nMy first day delivering, I was sent out on my second delivery of the day. It was in a more sketchy part of town I had an order at a small housing complex. \n\nI manage to find the address, lock my doors and walk up to the house with my bag. I knock, and a girl who looked like she was about 19 answered the door. First thing I notice was that she wasn't wearing any pants...just underwear and a top. Tried my best not to stare...but it's kinda hard not to notice something that unexpected.\n\nShe then preceded to tell me that her mother ordered the pizza but she was still on her way home, and kindly asked if I'd like to come inside and have a seat while she waited on her mother to pay for the pizza! Since I hadn't worked at the store very long, I explained that we weren't allowed to enter houses...which is basically what I'd just got done watching in my training video. \n\nAfter being at this store for a few months and realizing how laid back my coworkers and managers are, I'm sure no one would mind if you stepped inside to smoke a joint with some extra friendly customers...or step inside for any reason really! \n\nAnyways, I went outside and waited in my car for 10 minutes or so and then her mom came walking down the street and flagged me down. She was very apologetic and explained that her car broke down a block away. I told her the total and she tipped me $7.00 which is surprising since no one ever tips in that area!  \n\nNow months later, I can honestly say that I sorta regret not taking the girls offer to come inside, and I haven't been lucky enough to have any repeat situations like this one! \n\nJust a tip for other delivery drivers out there...if a half naked girl invites you in...take the hint and roll with it!",

        "text": "Hello everyone! This is only my second post to reddit, and my first here on r/TFTPG. Please excuse any formatting issues; feedback is appreciated! TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nToday, I ordered delivery from Pizza Hut. Pretty easy order, a cookie cake and a large pie. I left instructions in the (very limiting) box to come around the back of my apartment building on X street. The building doesn't allow any guest parking or pedestrian entrance without a key, so coming around the back is the easiest way to get to my apartment. I realize it's inconvenient, but I haven't found an easier way to get delivery.\n\nI sat and waited outside my apartment door on X street for the pizza guy. Delivery was expected at 1:13 pm; I went outside around 1:00 pm. 1:25 pm comes around, no delivery guy. I decided to call the store. \n\nI called once, no answer. Restarted my phone, as I've been having some connection issues lately. Called again, got an answer.\n\n&gt;Pizza Hut Guy (PHG): Hi thanks for calling Pizza Hut, how can I help you?\n\n&gt;Me: Hi, I placed an order about 40 minutes ago, and it's now ten minutes late. I wanted to make sure the delivery guy got my instructions to come around back.\n\n&gt;PHG: Okay, let me get in touch with the driver.\n\n&gt;Me: Okay!\n\nDuring the call, I got a call from another number. Figured it was the Delivery Guy (DG)! I answered, held the other call.\n\n&gt;Me: Hello?\n\n&gt;DG (who, by the way, has a thick accent, kind of hard to understand): Hi, I'm the Pizza Hit delivery driver, do you have a code to get into the gate?\n\n&gt;Me: There is no code, that's why I asked you to come to the back.\n\n&gt;DG: Ok, well I'm in front of the office, do you have a code?\n\n&gt;Me: No..I don't have a code. Can you come around back?\n\n&gt;DG: I'm standing in front of the leasing office, can you come here?\n\n&gt;Me: Ok.\n\nNow, it's quite a long walk to the office. I live on the second floor all the way on the other side of the building. Also, I'm technically not supposed to be living here as I'm not on the lease, but it's a temporary living place with a friend until I go to college in the fall. If they found out that I'm living here, my friend could get in trouble. Still, I go down to the office.\n\nI look around. Guy isn't in the office. I look outside, he's standing out there. Ok, cool. I go outside, he apologizes. I tell him it's fine. The following ensues:\n\n&gt;DG: (places the food on the ground, holds up the receipt, points to total) Your total is $14.XX. (I don't remember exactly)\n\n&gt;Me: (hands him a $20 bill) Can I have $4 in change?\n\n&gt;DG: (pulls out his wallet) I only have $3. Is that ok?\n\n&gt;Me: I guess, that's fine. \n\n&gt;DG: Ok, thank you. Sorry, I'm new and I don't know the area well.\n\n&gt;Me: It's okay, thanks.\n\nI take my pizza and walk away. When I get back to my apartment, I decided to call the store about him not having a bank. From my trek here, I know he should have at least change to the nearest $20 in bills. \n\nCalled once, no answer.\n\nNow I'm a little upset. I know it's not my phone this time, as it did the exact same thing last time, and it was working before I left the apartment. He called me, too! \n\nI try to go online and fill out a survey, but I realize I don't have a receipt either. \n\nI call the store again. This time, I get an answer, and of course it's the same guy as before.\n\n&gt;PHG: Hi thanks for calling Pizza Hut, carryout or delivery?\n\n&gt;Me: Actually, I had a comment on a delivery I just received.\n\n&gt;PHG: Okay, what happened?\n\nI tell him about the change, how I know they should have a bank, how he took the money from his wallet. Also, I told him they should give the instructions to the driver. I wasn't looking to get the guy in trouble, but it just seemed like he needed more training from his store. Not his fault.\n\nPHG offers to have the guy bring me the dollar. Hell no, it's just a dollar, and I knew it would be coming out of DG's tip. I really didn't think it was DG's fault, so I didn't want him to suffer. I just told PHG they need to give their drivers change and instructions. He said ok, he'll talk to the driver, and he gave me credit for my next order. (I didn't seek it, but he put it there.)\n\nNow, my question for you guys. Was I in the wrong for calling the store? I really didn't want DG to get in trouble, but I felt like he was really getting the short end of the stick since he didn't seem to get proper training! What do you guys think?\n\nTL;DR: Guy didn't have change for a $20 on a $14 order. I called the store, left a comment, guy didn't really seem to have training. Am I an asshole?\n\n",

No problem, usually. But the other day, I come back to my car after a delivery and I see some scruffy looking bald dude leaning on the hood of my car, as if he were crying or deep in thought. I kindly ask him to get off the hood of my car since I need to go back to the store and he asks if I could give him a ride to the beachside, which was strange since the hotel was already right on the beach. I say no and he keeps persisting I give him a ride. I said I'd love to \n*(not really) but the company doesn't let us give people rides. He says \"okay\" and walks away. I start my car and pull out and wait for the traffic to clear up so I can pull out.\n\nAfter a few seconds of waiting, the dude knocks on my passenger window and says \"I can give you money if you give me a ride\". At this point, I'm a bit fed up and I tell him to piss off. This was an unwise move on my end, since I made who was quite possibly an angsty drug addict angry, and was more mobile on his feet than I was in a stationary car. He runs over to my window and starts yelling at me. Something along the jist of \"I work in the service industry too fucker, I'll cut your throat for talking to me like that, you best be careful next time you come around here 'cause I'll be looking out for you, I'm a nice guy, do you wanna fucking go boyo\", I don't remember it all verbatim but it pretty much that. I told him that \"nice guys\" don't threaten to cut people's throats. Then I point out bobblehead on my dashboard and told him if he said anything else, it'd be recorded on that and be used as evidence against him in court. He fell for it and kept apologizing to me, saying he was sorry and I was right how nice guys don't threaten to cut people's throats and he tried to shake my hand through the window. I told him to get lost and I pulled out into traffic.\n\nIt's something that scared me then and I'll probably be laughing about in a few years. But let this be a lesson to you all, be weary of who hangs around your car while you're out on a delivery, keep your head, and invest in some dashcam or other device that records footage &amp; audio. I know I would've loved to have that on some kind of tape. ",

        "text": "I just want to start by saying this is just a rant about some spent to emotions I have about this job and the toll it's taken on me. About a year ago I started working at a pizza place and I fell in love with the job. As someone who impulse buys, i enjoyed getting paid daily. I loved everyone I worked with, the work was easy and felt rewarding, and the environment was funny we light hearted. I loved going to work. Unfortunately a few months ago I was the victim of an attempt at robbery. I had a delivery late at night in a relatively safe neighborhood and it was my last run for the night. I wasn't really paying attention because I just wanted to deliver it and go home. I pulled up onto a group of people who flagged me down and I pulled beside them. Now at this point I started to feel uneasy and decided not to get out of my car but just open the door a little. One of the guys walked up to my car with his hands shuffling in his jacket pocket and as I began to ask for the money he tries to snag the pizza and run. My first mistake was holding onto it. The guy began to punch me and I knew he still had at least five other friends with him behind my car. I threw the pizza out my car and floored it to safety. After getting some distance away I called the police and my manager and I initially was fine for the most part. I know bar things can happen, i should have paid more attention, the list goes on and u accepted what happened and tried to move on. Unfortunately that didn't last long as I began to have panic attacks in every single delivery. This was a part time job while I'm in school so I'm a night driver and everywhere I went I felt like I was going to be robbed. Anytime I had to take a delivery to somewhere on the back roads or if there was more than one person I'd have a panic attack. My hands would shake, I'd start sweating, I couldn't breathe, and my vision for blurry. I couldn't take a delivery without circling the house two or three times to make sure no one was hiding in the bushes ready to jump me. It's gotten better but I no longer enjoy work. I dread going there because I feel like today's the day I'm going to be killed or robbed again. I dread the panic and fear I feel on some deliveries. I think it's time that I move in and find a new job because the stress is starting to get to me. Thank you for anyone who rear all this. TL:DR I got robbed, started having panic attacks, thinking about quitting job.",

        "text": "Weirdest delivery of my pizza delivering life.\n\nA little background, two summers ago I'm living in New Orleans, just finished graduate school for a Masters and am in the process of applying to medical school. I get a pizza delivery job at a locally owned shop to make some quick cash. All in all it was a great summer gig, laid back shop, no uniform to wear, and since it was summer 90% of deliveries were to tourists in hotels who tipped well.. Was pulling in around $500-600 on three nights of work a week in mostly cash (throwaway so suck it IRS). With that said, you still got the occasional delivery to undergraduates of a certain New Orleans university who were known for being on the entitled side and stingy tippers with daddy's money to boot.\n\nOne night I'm up for a delivery to the college area on the opposite end of town, bummer, ok I take my order and go. I get to the house and walk up onto the porch, front door is cracked open like an inch and this is probably 9:00 at night. I knock on the open door and two dogs start barking like crazy from inside. It's a solid wood door with windows at the top so I stand on my tip toes and peek inside, there's a Labrador and some little mutt barking on the other side. Down a hallway I see a living room and a couch with a person on it, but I can only see half of their body, what looks like a woman’s bare legs. She's not moving and I think she must me passed out. I pound on the door again, holding the knob so I don't inadvertently push it open. Peek up in the window again and the legs haven't moved.. Well this is awkward, I consider just getting in my car and driving off, but I decide to push the door open a little and stick my head in to shout and try and wake her up. I holler in \"Hello! Delivery!\" Dogs are going crazy, I shout this inside the open door like five times, now I have a clear view down the hallway to the legs on the couch, not even 15 feet away from me. I'm really torn, going inside this person’s house would be pretty weird, but on the other hand I'm a little concerned and not sure I should just leave. So I go inside.. I walk into the living room and there’s an attractive girl on the couch in underwear and a tank top, looks to be around 20 and seemingly unconscious, on the table next to her is a half drank glass of white wine. At this point the dogs are still barking at me like mad, and the little one has even jumped onto the couch, on top of the girl and is still barking at me! I shout almost right into the girls face \"Hello!? Wake up! Are you OK!?\" like 5 times and she doesn't even flinch. I put my hand on her shoulder and start to shake her, first not to hard but then pretty violently all while yelling at her, all while both dogs are barking and the little one is jumping all over her. After like two minutes of this I'm sure this girl has OD'd or something. I'm a little frazzled and out loud I say \"Ok, I'm going to call 911 and get you help!\" Almost instantly she opens her eyes. Not like groggy just woke up opens her eyes, but opens her eyes wide and grills me. At first I feel incredibly awkward for being in her living room and having my hand on her shoulder, and I expect her to be freaked out but she isn't.. And she just stares at me without saying anything. I start to explain \"I'm so sorry, the door was open and you weren't responding, I came in because I thought something was wrong.\" She just says \"OK\" and that’s it. Now she seems like she’s fine.. She signs the receipt (no tip, at least that part of the delivery was as expected) and I leave the pizza, and walk out and close the door behind me. I had some weird deliveries that summer but this one will always stand out the most. I still have no idea what in the hell happened that night and I guess I never will, but I left feeling pretty sure that she was pretending to be unconscious the entire time.\n",

It started Saturday into Sunday when I worked an 11:30 closing shift into an 11:00am-8pm morning shift on Sunday. I hate these shifts, but I can get a mostly full night's rest, it is a good way to make a hundred bucks or so, and I got Monday the 4th off. SCORE! The biggest downside to this is that the next week's schedule hadn't been posted yet, so after my day off, I had no idea when I would work next. No big deal, I usually come in at 5, so I'll call at noon on Tuesday to see when I come in, go to a lunch that was planned with my cousins and grandmother at 1, and maybe go into work if I'm scheduled. \n\n\nI get woken up on Tuesday at 11:30 with my manager calling telling me that I was supposed to open at 11, but they just realized it too (I don't usually open), so just come in soon. This was very frustrating, because I am missing a lunch with family that usually can't get together, but what ever, I deal with the frustration and go in, take a few deliveries here and here, do a little bit of prep, and generally just sit around being tired. My buddy Ryan is going to be coming in at 5, so I don't have to work too late, I'll be able to head home, hang out with the girlfriend, and try to relax. \n\n4:00pm rolls around and it's starting to pick up a bit. Both my phone and my manager's phone start dinging like crazy with messages from people. I'm cutting a pizza and checking my phone when my girlfriend (Who used to work at my store) messages me about Ryan. \n\nHe wasn't coming in. He died.\n\nI take these two last orders to customers, trying not to let the shock sink in. Thankfully my store isn't filled with heartless robots, so no more deliveries, and I fuck off home. \n\nI don't know what happened to Ryan yet. He was 23. We went to high school together. He was the nicest mother fucker at that store. He was chill, and honest, and happy, a great person to be around. He brought a positivity with him wherever he went. I'm glad to have met and known him, I'm glad that we made plans even though I'll have to accept him standing me up. \n\n\nAll these bad things made me think. I have been throwing my life away into this trashcan job. I'm not happy there anymore, and I don't think I ever will be again. I put passions and dreams on hold so I could make a small amount of money. I haven't done what I want to do, and I never will be able to while working there. I quit while writing this post. \n\nI'm not going to take the joy that Ryan brought to everyone and drive it away wishing I was somewhere else.\n\nA lot of people will miss you, Ryan. Thanks for being a bright light in a dark tunnel. \n\n\n",

The mail box directly in front of his house had 6525, and his house itself didn't have numbers on it. I know this isn't his fault, but it's not mine either. Just another day on the job, I suppose.",

        "text": "It was a typically patriotic July 4th and we were absolutely flooded with orders. I think at one time there were almost 30 orders waiting to be taken (which is probably 10-15 times the amount of orders we typically have ready to go out on a Thursday evening). I grabbed 4 or 5 of them and headed out with my company hat moisted with a band of Diet-Coke-fueled sweat. I got to the first house and it was 7 or 8 people in their late teens or early twenties. I give them their pizza and the girl opens up the box, looks at her friends, then turns the box around to show me.\n\n&gt;Girl: \"This isn't our order.\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"I'm so sorry, just one second.\"\n\nI look down at the delivery sticker, it has their address and lists a total of 1 pizza on the order. I look at the sticker on the box, it is corresponding to the correct address. I look at the pizza details, it is also matching what is in the box.\n\n&gt;Me: \"What was it that you ordered?\"\n\nThe girl giggles and looks me in the eye.\n\n&gt;Girl: \"The pizza is right, but I said to put a funny joke on the box, there's nothing on the box.\"\n\nShe points to the grease-stained inside lid of the pizza box.\n\nI gathered the strength of a thousand Mountain Dews so that I wouldn't just drop everything and drive home.\n\nNow, let me take a moment and describe something to people who haven't worked at a pizza place. The way it works (or at least the way my national chain worked) is that you have several roles: manager, shift leader, insider, and driver. Managers do exactly that, they perform all the managerial duties and typically are in the office doing financial/paperwork stuff. Shift leaders are like baby managers, they are the supervisors for all the insiders and drivers. They typically fill in for whatever needs to be done at the time, but are also responsible for tasks like assigning deliveries to drivers.\n\nNow the last two: insiders and drivers. These are the grunts of the operation. Insiders are the guys inside that take, make, and box orders up. Drivers are just delivery drivers. Nothing is perfect, so there is some overlap between these two. If a delivery driver gets in and there's no orders to take, they should go help perform insider tasks, especially answering phones.\n\nNow the relevant part: when the store is extremely busy, you want people to be doing a single task to be most efficient. You don't want each insider to be answering phones, making orders, boxing orders, cleaning, etc. You want one person taking calls, one person preparing boxes (putting stickers on boxes), one person spreading dough, etc. You also want drivers to JUST BE DRIVERS. This means that especially when it is busy and there are a lot of orders to take, the drivers won't be looking at the notes meant for the people making the orders. This is relevant because *especially on holidays, I will never see your \"please write a joke\" instruction*. Anyway, back to the conversation:\n\n&gt;Me: \"I'm really sorry, but it's July 4th and we're extremely busy, I also wasn't the one to prepare the order so there's no way I would have known.\"\n\nShe looks back at her friends and then looks back at me.\n\n&gt;Girl: \"Oh well, we were going to give you a big tip.\"\n\nShe hands me a wad of bills. I sift through them and find that she gave me the exact amount rounded up to the next dollar (less than 25 cents).\n\n&gt;Me: \"Would you like the coins?\"\n\n&gt;Girl: \"You can keep it!\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"Okay thanks, have a good day.\"\n\nI turn and walk back to my car, gathering the strength to not curse their house to a thousand ding-dong-ditchings.",

(Not a big deal but it happens at least once every two shifts and I never complain about it even though I am the sole person getting FUCKED late pizza = lower tip and since im on the road im getting paid less too. took 40 minutes to leave the store with it)\n\nALRIGHT so I get back on a delivery at like 8:15 and its still busy so im like whatever Ill take another and just leave when I get back.  So I take it and of course there is no tip (this was the 45 minutes until it left the store order because up front Fucked up yet again) and I get back around 8:40, and its still pretty busy, so being nice I take a double, thinking I will be able to just leave when I get back since ive already stayed 40 minutes past. \n\nNope I get back at 9:15 and the massive pile of dishes is still there nobody has touched, including the person whos job it is.  The manager comes up to me and says  You arent on Oven anymore you have to do the dishes.  What the fuck? \n\nI said ok and got to work but I was mad as shit the whole time.\n\n**So my question is could I have said Fuck No and left and not get in trouble?   I dont want to get fired or lose hours but I also dont want to put up with this horse shit.  The manager who made me do dishes is an asshole who only manages one night a week, the rest he is a driver but I feel like if I talk back I will get in trouble.  This guy is a super dickhead**\n\nOh and I have to open tomorrow morning but still had to stay super late. \n\n A guy who was scheduled to leave a full hour after me left 10 min before me I mean that alone should be enough to tell him to fuck off right?",

        "text": "The phone rang at the store and I answered; a loud older woman who was screaming at \"Bobby\" in regards to anything he did while she was on the phone with me. Simple order, just a cheese pizza and order of wings. The constant screaming made me want to get off the phone as quickly as possible, and admittedly I didn't give her any coupons to reward the experience.\n\nLuck had it that I was taking the order out. Not too far away, just an unpleasant trailer park that hadn't yielded much in the way of tips before. The trailer itself was rather clean looking from the outside and the small enclosed yard was tidy and clean cut. \n\nThe first warning sign was the smell. I don't have a strong sense of smell generally, but this was a warm, sticky wave of feces. The second warning sign was the two large clear trash bags on the porch; primarily paper product but with the alarming smear of human waste laced throughout the bags. \n\nFeeling uncomfortable, I still trudged forward in the war on hunger. I knocked, no response. I knocked again after a minute or two and heard the familiar screaming of the lady saying she'll get the door. At this point, I also heard some male giggling.\n\nThe door opens, revealing a turtle-like older woman; short hair, alarmed eyes, strange elongating neck. Behind her was an adult male, probably in his 30's or 40's, with a massive beard caked with human feces. I froze at this point for what felt like an eternity; I was lost in the dry caked bits of his beard and the runny moist segments. The smell at this point was so unbearably awful that it tripped my mind back into my training and I went through the process of getting her to sign (no tip) and get the food to them. As I passed the wings to the son, he snatched them quickly and gleefully, but allowing a bit of his beard collection to drip on his mother's nightie. \n\nAfter making my escape I was troubled. I could not stop smelling the dysfunction of that man's beard, but my coworkers just thought it was funny. How can somebody live like that? I called adult protective services because I didn't know what else to do.\n\nFast forward several weeks and the area supervisor is in when we get another order from this place. I outright tell her that I will not take this order. Despite being shocked, she agreed that if the story is true then we shouldn't be delivering. She went with another driver to the same location, but didn't see the son. I haven't seen them since, but wanted to share this story with everybody here. ",

        "text": "Alright this is pretty much a book, so bear with me here.\n\nSo I started working at a local wing restaurant/bar. The food's pretty expensive but it's damn good too. I had just finished my training and this was my second shift where I was alone in the kitchen/delivery driving while the bartender handles the bar. The kitchen normally closes at 1 and we stop delivering at 12, that way we can begin to clean up the kitchen early enough in the night. \n\nWell this guy who I'll call Ranty calls in around 11:00 asking how late we deliver. Now he was very noticeably drunk over the phone, which already has rough speaker quality. I had to ask him to repeat his question twice to be able to understand it. He says he'll call back soon and hangs up. Around 20 minutes later he calls again trying to place an order, this time his speech is even worse. I spend around 5 minutes trying to understand him and finally get his name/phone number/address down and ask what he'd like to order. He hangs up. About 20 minutes after that he calls again even more drunk and I have my manager take the call since I can't understand a word he's saying at this point. The manager uses the phone at the bar and gets the order down. This dude ordered 3 dozen wings in 6 different flavors and 6 sides. Meaning that all the cleaning I had done at this point has to be re-done. Manager asks me if i want to take the order or just say no since it's past 11:30 at this point and I'd have to drive out past midnight for the delivery. I'm feeling nice, so whatever, I'll take it. Ranty also calls again around midnight and says he'll add $4 to the tip if we bring him a bag of ice.\n\nI cook the order while cleaning what I can, 20 minutes pass and I have everything cooked and in the warming bad. Type in the guy's address and see he lives 16 minutes away, right on the edge of our delivery range. Whatever, I'll deal with it. Drive out to his block and there isn't a single house with lights on, and addresses are extremely difficult to read. I figure out which house is his and walk up to the door to see him through the window, sitting on the couch with one hand in his pants.\n\nI knock on the door and he comes up. \n\n\"That'll be 50-something, sign the top copy and the bottom on is yours\"\n\n\"Yeah let me just go get my kids real quick\"\n\nKid who is right around 12-13 comes up and says \"give me a minute\" and runs back to get his dad. Around 6 more kids ages 13-16 come out with him.\n\nRanty, while holding a pen to the tip line, says \"How much do you think a bag of ice costs? $1?\"\n\nI say, \"Well sir, my manager told me on the phone that you guys agreed to $4 for a bag\"\n\n\"Well tell your manager he can suck my fucking cock\"\n\n\"I'll convey the message, but you still agreed on $4\"\n\nRanty looks at the kids and asks them all how they think the ordering experience was.\n\n\"It was good\" says the youngest kid in his pre-pubescent voice.\n\n\"NO IT FUCKING WASN'T\" exclaims Ranty.\n\nHe proceeds to give me a 10 minute speech on how he shouldn't have to waste 20 minutes of his life to order \"some fucking god damn chicken wings\". \n\nI apolgize and tell him that the quality on the phone in the kitchen isn't very good.\n\n\"What does that sound like kids? That sounds like a fucking excuse to me. What are we gonna do to fix this?\"\n\n\"I'll talk to my manager to see if we can get a better phone in the kitchen.\"\n\n\"I don't give a fuck what you talk to your manager about. How are we gonna fix this without using excuses?\"\n\nI tell him the same thing again and he looks at me and says, \"What's your name kid\"\n\n\"Dheinzen2\"\n\n\"Well Dheinzen2, I'd like to give you a tip, but you gotta tell me, is that cocksucker manager of yours getting any of it?\"\n\nNow delivery driver and bartender split tips on week nights, which it was, so we do split tips.\n\n\"No sir, I'm the delivery driver, he's the bartender. I get the delivery tips.\"\n\nHe signs the receipt and gives it back and says \"Now get the fuck off my property before I call the cops\" and slams the door in my face. I look down at the receipt and see he gave me a $10 tip. \n\nI get back to the restaurant and tell the manager about this and he says, \"So he told you to tell me to suck his dick?\"\n\n\"Yes, he did\"\n\n\"and then he tipped you $10?\"\n\n\"That's right\"\n\n\"Fuck it I'll suck his dick for 10 bucks. Now go clean the fuckin kitchen, I wanna get out of here.\"\n\nThus ends my first night of delivering alone. All in all, I got about $70 in tips from a 6 hour shift.\n\nTL;DR: Manager says he'd suck a belligerent customer's dick because of some phone issues and a bag of ice.",

I already started leaving my wallet at the store and only carrying 20 bucks on me, then I also started putting my pistol in my center console and carrying a 3 inch blade on me. I just don't know, I mean if someone does try to rob me I feel like they shouldn't deserve to put the fear in all the drivers of the city and I'd wanna fight back. But on the other hand, if the stories are true, and it is 3 dudes with guns, I'd just give them all I have and leave. I feel more safe knowing it isn't my side of the city that has been targeted. But damn, it's still a little unnerving.\n\nEdit: BTW I do have a concealed carry permit, and knowledge on how to use my firearms, and know where deliveries might be sketchy.",

The pizza place I worked at would close at 10PM and around 9ish we'd get the first delivery to the bar. \n\nThe moment you step in the bar, a chain reaction begins. \n\n\"Ayyyyy pizza guy! Right here, it's mine!\" About 10 different people drunkenly claiming it's their pizza, thinking it's funny, then after about the 5th or 6th wrong person, you finally get to the right one who either has a tough time getting out their money, or a tough time signing the credit card slip, so it takes a little time. \n\nThen when it's said and done, you go back to the shop to find one or two more for the bar, because those people didn't know you guys delivered. \n\nGo through the same routine again because the \"it's my pizza\" joke never gets old, then head back to the shop to see 1 or 2 more orders because those people didn't see you walk by with pizza the first time, they saw you walk by the second time, and they didn't know you guys delivered. Rinse and repeat until closing time. \n\nUsually when we'd get a delivery order to the bar late at night, I'd know I wasn't going home the usual time that night. Tips were pretty good though honestly, so I couldn't complain too much.",

        "text": "So I work at Pizza Butt and was nearing the end of a 10-8 shift. I walk back in the store from a delivery around 7:10 - 7:15 and our \"temp\" assistant manager asked if I could make sauces. I was like \"yeah sure how many do you need?\" 3 pizza sauces and 2 breadstick sauces was all. I wasn't mad or anything but why not make the prep girl do it. She couldn't do her job since the prep table was the only place I could make the sauces but again whatever I'll do it. Sauces are easy as hell to make. The other 3 drivers come back to the store and work on dishes etc etc. Finally a delivery comes up about 7:30. The assistant manager calls (using fake names) Steven up for a delivery. I go up to the assistant manager and I'm like \"Hey man I'm up first in dispatch.\" He goes \"Are you done with the sauces?\" \"No you just told me about them 10 minutes ago\" He looks at Steven and just says \"You're up then.\" I walk back to the dish room mainly confused at first then another delivery comes up so he calls the other driver up. At this point I go up to him and say \"What the fuck man you can't skip me on deliveries this is my job.\" His answer was \"We'll you're not done with the sauces yet so no deliveries.\" He had deliveries bagged and ready to go and wouldn't send me out even though I was the only driver at the store. \n\nI took 40 minutes in total to do the sauces and made sure to clock out at 8 on the dot. Told him to put in my 2 weeks if he was going to pull that BS with me. It doesn't help that he hates guys and flirts with all the underage girls in the store which is mainly embarrassing to watch. They never go to our manager to write him up though which sucks butts.",

I have a run to an apartment complex which I'm familiar with, but whose building numbers are vague if using logic or common sense. Buildings on one side of the \"private street\" are sometimes numerical, sometimes alphabetical. If the streets were planned, the planner was drunk. So I get near the building I think I'm looking for, and seeing no lights on, call the number on the ticket. Guy answers. \nMe: \"Hi this is your delivery driver, I'm outside your building.\" \nDude: \"How do you feel about frolf?\"\nMe: \"I love frolf, frolf is life.\"\nD: \"really?\" We talk about frisbee golfing for a minute, local courses and what have you. \"Can my roommate borrow your mid-range because blah blah?\"\nM: \"well, i don't have discs in my car, but, sure. Anyway, I'm here.\"\nD: \"shit! you're the pizza guy. not the dude i was just talking to.\" \nM: mmhm\n\n3 dollar tip. Despite the shitty tip - I've got a new golfin' buddy. Hard to hate this job.\n Also - how weird is it to witness the differences in how people live? I live in a college town, population 400000 in the summer, with a couple of major corporate HQs. On one end of town, people sleep soundly in their 500,000 - 2,000,000 dollar perimeter secured homes. On the other, people try to scratch up rent while dodging bullets. As pizza people, we see into the homes of those who live extremely affluently, and those whose living spaces are literal shit holes. Everybody orders pizza. The great equalizer. Errol Morris of Frederick Wiseman should make a pizza driver doc. G'nite. ",

        "text": "It's been quite a while since I told my last delivery driver story here on reddit. Here are links to them, if you would like to refresh your memory\n\n[Story #2 Part 1: We're not doing that anymore.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/43g7w9/story_2_part_1_were_not_doing_that_anymore) \n\n[Story #2 Part 2: We're not doing that anymore.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/45e1yo/story_2_part_2_were_not_doing_that_anymore)\n\nWhile I was addressing the issue within those stories I was aware that my employer might not address the the issue in a manner that was acceptable to me, so I started work to lay the ground work for addressing this issue through alternative means. This story took place during the end phase of the last story (see above), there is also a secondary story that I will be composing/have composed, will be posting/posted, and then linking to.\n\n&lt;place holder for secondary story&gt;\n\nOk, so this story is about realizing that although I addressed the MVR issue for 3 of my coworkers, my employer refused to engage me as the chosen representative of the majority of employees at my work location. I was their chosen representative, we probably could have forced the issue down their throat, and effectively we would have created a union at our location, but we chose to go a different direction. So here is what we decided to do.\n\nWe filed another class action lawsuit. When I say another, that's because of the story I told last year:\n\n[Story #1: Mileage Reimbursement Lawsuit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/3zs31w/story_1_mileage_reimbursement_lawsuit/) \n\nI knew that the [FLSA](https://www.dol.gov/whd/flsa/) would not play a factor since the [kick-back](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/531.35) was not enough to bring our wage below federal level. But I also knew we had a solid argument since this issue is a more clear cut violation of my [state's minimum wage law](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49.46), since any [deduction](http://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=296-126-028) we incurred resulted in a [willful](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49.52.080) [rebate of wage/kick-back](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49.52.050). Now, how to go about addressing this issue for more than just the three (3) that I had already received their recompense.\n\nSo I started calling up attorneys. I started with the attorneys I already knew, the firm that took my [mileage reimbursement case](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/3zs31w/story_1_mileage_reimbursement_lawsuit/) was not interested. The attorney that addressed the [text message lawsuit against my employer](http://gregspages.com/discussion/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=1703) was initially interested, but then his partners decided that the case was not financially worth it for them to handle. Through referrals from these two attorneys that I knew I started calling other attorneys and briefly discussed the issue over the phone. I had one attorney that wanted me to pay her $3,000 just to \"investigate\" the applicable law on this issue and after \"investigating\" the applicable law she would decide whether she'd take the case. I let her know that I would consider that offer and call her back if... (I never called her back and I will never refer anyone to her). \n\nDuring one of the conversations I had I was referred to a larger firm (the attorney I was speaking with was a single attorney operation). I, and one of my co-workers, drove into Seattle and sat down with a few of the attorneys at their offices. We explained the issue, I presented them with the documentation I had collected and broke it down to them via the RCWs(Washington state law/statutes) that covered and/or applied to this issue. They decided to look over my documentation and consider the case. While they were considering the documentation we continued to speak to and meet other attorneys over the next few weeks (we sat down with a total of 5 law firms in two weeks.)\n\nA few days later I, and my co-worker, again drove into Seattle and sat down with the attorneys of [Rehki &amp; Wolk](http://www.rekhiwolk.com/) and I explained the issue and the applicable laws. During this meeting I was asked what my claims were, how many times had I purchased the MVR in the past 3 years. I answered honestly, four (4) times. But I also had to inform them that *I had no claim*, but that was why my co-worker was with me. **He had a claim. He would be the named plaintiff.** I would be stepping back and only offering my moral support and my opinion as a friend and co-worker from here on out.\n\n[Rehki &amp; Wolk](http://www.rekhiwolk.com/) agreed to take the case. We informed them we were waiting on other firms to get back with us. We waited two (2) weeks then my co-worker accepted [Rehki &amp; Wolk](http://www.rekhiwolk.com/) taking the case. On July, 6th 2015 Case number: 15-2-16336-1 was filed in the Superior Court of King County. A month later I was given a copy of the complaint and posted it here: [Mihas v. Papa Washington, LLC](http://gregspages.com/discussion/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=3463&amp;sid=4f2ac9d424e1a919641b8e6e88314c41).\n\nIt has now been nearly a year since the case was initially filed. In early 2016 **a settlement was offered** to the named plaintiff **to settle his individual claim.** I was not told how much that settlement was worth, but I would guess it was an significantly more than his actual claims, plus attorney's costs/fees. What that settlement would have done was manifold:\n\n* 1) It would have paid the named plaintiff more than, significantly more than, what his individual claims were worth.\n* 2) Stop the case from being certified as a class action. Which would mean that up to 750 employees would not receive any relief from the rebate of wages they had compelled to give.\n\n**That settlement offer was declined.** \n\nThat is where we are right now. \n\n-----\nIf you are, or were, a delivery driver of Papa Washington, LLC. or (possibly) PJ Sound Pizza, LLC. anytime between 7/6/2013 and 3/1/2016 you might want to contact the attorneys of [Rehki &amp; Wolk](http://www.rekhiwolk.com/) and discuss whether or not you have a claim (you probably do and you might want to become involved if you want to see any relief (that means money)).\n\n\n",

I got tipped $5 on that delivery. I would come to bless that man's name. And his family's name.\n\nI get to the other house, and things look a bit suspicious. Admittedly, in the confusion, I hadn't reviewed the driver's slip. The lady basically grabbed the pizza out of my hand and retreated to her grotto. I went back to the car, glanced at the slip on the bag, and realized we were owed $19.52.\n\nOh shit.\n\nI went back up to the door. Asked her for payment. She said she was told it was free. I didn't really believe her, but I decided to head back to the car and call the store, and she said she was going to call the store as well. Manager told me they owed me the money but that they were going to come out and pay it. \n\nI waited for about a minute, decided it probably wasn't going to happen unless I went to the door, so I went to the door, and informed the elderly lady that if they didn't pay for the pizza, the store would be forced to report them to the local police. She asked if it mattered that some of the pizza was eaten. I said no, it did not.\n\nI go back to the car, expecting someone to come out with money. Wait about thirty seconds and realize this isn't happening.\n\nI return to the door, and got greeted by a man who I'll refer to as Mr. Prebeetus. Mr. Prebeetus *loudly* informed me that the pizza was supposed to be free, and that if he I didn't “get the hayell out of mah drahvway,” that he would “set his fohty-fahv on me!” (definitely not a local, from the accent, probably from just over the line in Georgia) I'm about to clear the fuck out, when the old lady hands the pizza to me.\n\nI get back to learn that the “customers” had called with not one, but *four* different numbers, and caused my normally stoic night manager to actually scream at them over the phone.\n\nMost hilariously, she referred to them as “fucking cunts,” a phrase I fully expect to never hear her use ever again.\n\nFinal verdict: I've decided it would be wise to invest in some pepper spray.",
