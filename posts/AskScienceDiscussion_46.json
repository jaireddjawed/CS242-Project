I don't like writing twice, so I'll quote [an article](https://medium.com/forseh/helping-scientific-research-in-algeria-indonesia-macau-peru-bahrain-philippines-iran-2a4eb18cbce4) with the idea:\n\n&gt; [...] the “poorest” 10 countries when it comes to that are Algeria, Indonesia, Macau, Peru, Bahrain, Philippines, Iran, Georgia, Kazahstan and Mongolia. We need at least one volunteer in each of these 10 countries to go to universities and let them know that teachers/PhD students/etc. can request funding through our platform. These volunteers will be called “representatives”. Big countries like Indonesia and Philippines will hopefully attract more than 3 representatives each. In this way, we will start by supporting the countries that need it most (even though all are welcome).\n\nWould you say that this is a good method for reaching out? Can you recommend a better method? I'm very open to feedback. Also, anyone here wanting to become a representative in his own country?",

Would that be a big impediment to its adoption? \n\n&gt; The synchronous longstator linear motor of the Transrapid maglev system is used both for propulsion and braking. It functions like a rotating electric motor whose stator is cut open and stretched along under the guideway. Inside the motor windings, alternating current generates a magnetic traveling field which moves the vehicle without contact. The support magnets in the vehicle function as the excitation portion (rotor). The respective magnetic traveling field works in only one direction, and therefore makes moving train collisions less likely, as more than one train on the track section would travel in the same direction. \n\n",

Thus, with a few limitations, you can build  your own PC from pieces specifically selected by you to suit your  specific needs at an appropriate cost.\n\nHowever,  I've investigated about doing such a thing for a mobile phone and I've  only found people making phones out of spare parts of broken phones of  the same model. If I wanted to build my own mobile phone: choose a case,  board, processor, ram, storage, battery and so on, it seems that right  now I couldn't do it.\n\nI think not only  \"geeks\" like me who would want to build their own mobile phones would  benefit from this. With standardized, modular phone construction, you  could take your broken phone to a store, and have the technician better  diagnose the problem and replace just the broken component.\n\nI  was wondering if phones will end up with this sort of architecture over  the coming decades, just like computers went from monolithic mainframes  to modular, standardized open PC architecture. Are steps being taken in  this direction? Is there a reason why manufacturers wouldn't want this  to happen? What are your thoughts?",

        "text": "I'm currently in college studying cognitive science and we have a project coming up where we have to design and perform an experiment. Me and a classmate were thinking of doing some sort of question order bias testing in a survey where the participants first read a text and then answer questions about it. The independent variable would be the order of the questions and it would have two levels (probably), so question order 1 would be group 1 and question order would be group 2. The problem is neither of those groups would really be a control group, but does it matter in this case?\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, you use a control group to make sure that the end result is not due to other, untested variables but given that we would use the exact same text and questions, and only change the order of the questions, do we need one here?\n\nEdit: I'm reading through my textbook (Research Methods in Psychology, 10th ed.) right now and it says: \n\n&gt; \"An independent variable must have at least two levels (also called conditions). One level **may** be considered the \"treatment\" condition and a second level the control **(or comparison)** condition.\" (emphasis added by me).\n\nThis reads like it's okay to do what we want to do, or am I wrong about this?",

So I'm wondering what kind of things are happening that feel like they could herald the next breakthrough for our understanding of the physical world?

        "text": "\nI was discussing with a user a model where a web-like structure formed by 4 dimensional network structures (proposed here: http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2015/12/what-is-spacetime-really/) could thinks as a brain, and thus, all the info existing there, would be real and what makes that universe's nature.\nThat blog is talking about web-like structures of 4-dimensional space-time, or in other words, web-like structures of dimensions. Space-time has an energy associated with it (vacuum energy or hypothetical dark energy). Since the brain is a web-like structure where pulses of energy in form of electrical signals form the information about what it thinks/imagines/visualises...etc, could these dimensional web like structures use that vacuum/dark energy to make connections and be like a brain? (so those 4 dimensional web-like structures would be themselves a brain. If that happened, then all what existed (matter, energy, live beings... would exist in the form of information. Could we then consider that matter, energy...etc existing in that universe in the form of information to be real since it would be what forms that universe (in the form of information)\nHe told me that there was a unitarity problem: in that model, information would not be conserved (as a brain can easily think in non-unitary models where info is lost). But I don't see the problem, I'm not proposing a model where information itslef suffers from non-unitarity and thus, it is not conserved. I'm proposing a model where a brain-like structure formed by these 4 dimensional webs could think just as a normal brain does. Imagine considering the mind as a universe (so all what would exist there would be thought by the brain, and would be made by information in the form of pulses between neurons). I'm proposing a similar model to that, but instead of being a brain, a 4-dimensional web-like structure.",
