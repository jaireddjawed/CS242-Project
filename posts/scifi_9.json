We only see the heads of presidents and actors/actresses in a head museum (it might have a name but it’s escaping me) but it makes me wonder, are there heads of history’s villains in these museums or somewhere else on display? Like Adolf Hitler, Kim Jung Un, Jeffrey Dahmer, etc. The list can go on and on. \n\nI feel like it would make sense because I know I’d pay a good amount of money to be able to see and interact with Adolf Hitlers head and other villains from history. (I’m a history undergraduate fyi, just wanted to clarify that. Haha) \n\nI mean their just heads they can’t really cause any more harm and a 1000 years into the future it would just be really interesting to have conversations with history’s villains alongside history’s heroes in the head museums. Do you think it does/could exist in Futurama universe or am I just overthinking things here?\n\nLet me know. Thanks for reading. :)",

If you ever been in a vehicle then you know that you are moving with it and if you stopped you would be destroy from it from impact. So now lets imagine a universe that moves in waves. Up down left and right. Also other ways to lets say time. If your atoms or force stopped and moved in such a way then you would have movement because you would be riding the wave in one direction and resisting all the others for direction to where you want to go. \n\nNo the question is how. Well it's similar to frequencies in the way it moves. So what do you know that cancel's frequencies? Do that and problem solve. Energy is another thing but there are ways around that like using that wiggly force to generate energy. Possible. Not a expert. I just think it's worth looking into. Also need a field around a ship to cancel out the g-force.  Constantly changing by using a sensor to predict the movement of the universe and feed that to a machine to the generate a field to cancel out the force to a move stable g-force for life. \n\nCould also be used for space station to generate gravity.  Magnets attract and repeal so use the force of it. Seems, well not simple but possible to figure out the type of eild needed to attractive a whole body instead of just a point on the body. \n\nThere's a lot but yea. Happy to hopefully help.",

        "text": "A few days ago I came across this Twitter thread discussing the nature of superpowers in fiction.\n[this Twitter thread discussing the nature of superpowers in fiction](https://imgur.com/a/4c0qlx3)\n\nEssentially, the key ideas discussed in the thread were that:\n\n1. Superpowers are nothing more than infantile power fantasies.\n2. Old stories with superpowers were better because most of them were more open to interpretation, whereas a modern work with superpowers requires you to buy into the premise from the start.\n3. The best “powers” are subtle, ambiguous, and can be easily confused with normal phenomena. Creating an elaborate power system with fixed rules takes away the beauty of supernatural phenomenon. Over-explaining superpowers is mostly done to appeal to nerds that are obsessed with this sort of stuff.\n\nRegarding point 2, I’ve basically come to the conclusion that it is a reductive and disingenuous comparison. However, I’m still wondering how correct points 1 and 3 are. \n\nI have recently been writing and planning for a fantasy/science fiction story where some characters have strange abilities. I was initially trying to create an interesting power system. Nothing too detailed, but something logically consistent with fixed rules.\n\nBut reading that thread killed some of my momentum, because now I’m wondering if it is really worth over explaining superpowers in a story. In fact, are superpowers worth exploring at all if they really are just adolescent ideas? What are your thoughts on that thread?",

McEvoy:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis series just keeps getting better! Wow, I absolutely loved this story. I could hardly put the book down and once I did I was desperate for the next volume! I have read 29 books by Declan Finn and 28 of them in the last 9 months. I have greatly enjoyed books in several other series. But among my favorites are the White Ops and the Saint Tommy series.  I have also been working through Finn’s back catalogue. This was another excellent story, I had not read any description or reviews before picking it up. I was given an advanced copy of this one for an honest review. I am currently cycling through a few of his series and as soon as I had this one it jumped to the top of my ‘to be read’ pile. The description of this story is:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“When Earth First terrorists threaten to assassinate the Pope, the Rangers of White Ops are called in to protect him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the hostage situation at Yesdin planet, Sean Patrick Ryan is still bothered by the Renar weapons the terrorists used. When Earth First has the same weaponry, it's clear that something is wrong on Renar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDark forces stalk White Ops. but who will be the prey?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will be honest the further I get into this series the more I feel echoes of Babylon 5. But in most ways that only enhances the stories. But they are absolutely not just modified fan fiction. The framework that Finn uses and the characters he has written are exceptional. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis story takes the action to a very different level. Sean Patrick Ryan and his team of totentanzers – Rangers – are on an assignment to protect the Pope. They have also taken over personal protection for the president of the United Star Alliance. All the while Something is niggling at the back of Sean’s brain, tying together pieces of information from their last few missions Sean has an insight, one that will have huge repercussions for him, his team, and for the whole universe. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot only is Ryan is a magnet for trouble but they soon realize that their whole team is becoming so. And some very bad people are not only aware of them but know specifics. White Ops might be the elite team of the Rangers, but they are not enough for the coming storm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRyan and his team must traverse the universe, fighting the Earth First Threat, Thought Cops, and the threat that Ryan has uncovered. They must now prepare for maybe their most fearful foe yet, and be prepared to fight on many fronts at the same time. This story is packed full of action. But it is also setting the stage for far more to come. It has great characters. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was another very entertaining story with Finn’s usual sense of humour! I really enjoyed this offering from his masterful pen. It is a great read. And leaves you wondering what happens in book 5. An excellent read I can easily recommend this book, this series and all of the books from Finn I have read to date!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/807nj7mrwtja1.jpg?width=639&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0c9b1cec90ad521f58ab43d85f51a450e454ea35",

        "title": "Checked out of Star Trek? Season 3 Episode 1 of Picard might win you back.",
        "author": "Evis03",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/119az26/checked_out_of_star_trek_season_3_episode_1_of/",
        "text": "Like many who pine for the days of older Star Trek- I'd checked out. Discovery went from showing at least a little promise to one of the most rancid turds ever laid by a production company. Picard season 1 was vile. I checked out of season 2 around episode 3 in utter disgust. I'm not paying for a paramount subscription on the off change SNW will be worth the price (they have nothing else I want to watch). Then I start seeing positive reviews for season 3, from people who generally share my views on Nu Trek no less. I didn't want the rest of the TNG bridge crew to get the treatment other characters had, at the hands of writers who couldn't string together a sentence- let alone a cohesive story. And Nu Trek has a history of the early episodes of a season usually being the best, until by the end of the arc the plot is streaking through the mesosphere in a burning fireball of aborted story lines, huge feels and bigger contrivances- set to some awful ADR.\n\nBut I took the plunge. So, how was episode 1?\n\nIn a few words? Good! A vast improvement over everything I’ve seen in Nu Trek so far, and I’m actually looking forward to the next episode- maybe even the season as a whole. If you’ve been put off Star Trek, give this a punt. I obviously can’t promise the rest of the season won’t go to hell (which is the observed pattern), but the difference in quality in this episode alone leaves me confident we’re in the hands of a much better writer. It’s very much night and day, so I am cautiously optimistic.\n\nThe biggest difference for me is the dialogue. The way characters speak to each other in Nu Trek is something I find grating. There’s a sort of theatrical, affected element to their speech. It’s so unnatural I’m often wondering I’m watching bad acting or a good actor struggling to find a way to deliver this verbose purple prose with precision and palpability*. In this episode though I think I got the answer to that question. Now that the speech is far more natural and organic the actors have a much better sense of pacing and emphasis along with physical queues. They don’t just sound more real, they look more real. Of course this could also be down to better direction- but I’m certain the dialogue didn’t hurt.\n\n*Ohai Mr Lucas.\n\nRaffi is an excellent case in point. My impressions of her up until now have been mostly negative in the sense I didn’t like her as a writing device or as a character. The reasons are varied and applicable to most of the cast in those first two seasons (and Nu Trek as a whole), but give the actress a dramatic scene, some clear motivations to express (rather than having her announce those motivations), show her struggling but pulling through regardless and bam- the character actually fucking works. I have some sympathy for her and even a little bit of admiration- all in the course of maybe three scenes? I don’t think I’ve turned around on a character so much, so quickly.\n\nI’ll briefly describe one of those scenes. Minor spoilers for the rest of the paragraph! &gt;!Raffi is initially presented as a drug addict. She’s living in a sleazy place, the sort where vice (especially drugs) is openly displayed. She meets her dealer and is clearly very strung out. She buys a hit and makes to leave. Then comes back desperately asking for information. Turns out she’s been kicked out of Star Fleet, dumped by Seven and is hoping to buy her way back into their good books by finding out who stole something from a Daystrom site near by. After tense negotiations she signs over all the money she has left for a tip off. She then leaves. After a brief walk she ducks into an alley, takes out a communicator and makes a report to someone in star fleet, ending the communication by saying she needs more money. Expectations subverted! It was all an act! Then the camera pans down to show her still holding the drug in her hand. A few moments later she drops it. Double subversion- Raffi may not have fallen off the wagon and had her life go to shit- but she is an addict forced into a situation where she’s surrounded by constant temptation- which she is struggling with. Previous natural dialogue establishes that she’s been here for a while, at least on the order of weeks. But in spite of all this she’s still getting the job done. !&lt;\n\nCall me basic but I am now 100% behind this character.\n\nJerri Ryan gets to act! She’s had the same problem as Brent Spiner in that the role I know her in is one where the correct performance is kind of non acting. You want deadpan, steady, emotionless for both Data and Seven (admittedly to a lesser extent with the latter). But Seven of Nine in Picard seasons 1 and 2 has gone from being a cold emotionless deprogrammed drone slowly discovering and developing her humanity, to a cold mostly emotionless (except anger) warrior who kills people. But the right people! Point is in terms of giving Ryan some range to act in, it’s not a big upgrade. This Seven however is very different. She’s now in Star Fleet and Jerri Ryan gets to give a fantastic ‘Star Fleet Captain’ performance. She’s not in the chair yet but the character is already showing many of the qualities I admire in the Star Fleet Captain archetype, written by writers who know how to express them. Her struggle for the episode is duty to her ship against loyalty to a friend. Like the Raffi scene I described, this conflict plays out with care, well written dialogue that lets Ryan show instead of announce, and great interplay between Seven, Picard and Riker. \n\nVisually the show is solid. Sci fi these days generally is. The camera work is a bit more deliberate and less flashy. The production these days has the scope to be a lot more creative with camera placement and movement than any of the older Trek shows, and they use that. However this manifests in more subtle ways like a careful tracking shot with rack focus to introduce a scene, close ups and basic stuff like that. There’s still something a little strange to me about Star Trek with such a flexible, cinematic style of shooting, but that’s just because it isn’t what I’m used to. That said this episode made me realise how often Nu Trek really over does its camera direction and general shooting style. \n\nSadly ships are still lit like a club at throwing out time. The general visual tone is dark and shadowy, even in places like person quarters. It’s not a deal breaker by any means and it gives the show a look- but I’m reminded of a line from the Expanse: “We came all the way out here- why couldn’t we bring more light?”\n\nThe show gets some little details wrong too. Again not a deal breaker and things only sad bastards like me will even notice- let alone care about. Things on the order of ‘You don’t divert more power to the warp core, the warp core is the power plant. If you want to go faster you divert power to warp *engines*.’ Yeah, I’m that anal. But this sort of thing is just like of attention to detail or more likely lack of time (or the budget to employ a fan script checker). They are not fundamental issues with how the story is written and then presented. This is a minor dent on the body work- not a cracked axle. Likewise Crusher’s phaser rifle (don’t worry, Crusher didn’t get the Rambo treatment) seems like a worse version of what we’ve seen before. Picard feels a little bit too low energy even given his age, but that’s going to be very much subjective to how you perceive the character. My opinion is also probably biased by a desire to see TNG Picard again- but obviously the character in Picard is him decades on. Point is- there’s a reason this ‘criticism’ is in the ‘little details’ section. \n\nThere’s more to talk about as I thought this episode was genuinely some of the best Trek out the Nu Trek era. The captain of the Titan is done brilliantly. There are some wonderful little character moments and comedic beats. Despite the gloomy cinematography, the show *feels good*. It feels optimistic and hopeful without being twee or cringy. Thus far at least it hasn’t gone super dark, and I get the feeling if it ever does it will be for the sake of contrast, and written with care and delicacy rather than copying edgelord fanfic.\n\nIn short, if you’ve given up on Trek this may be worth coming back for. We’re still only one episode in, and experience suggests it is going to get worse. But the quality of this episode was a stark enough difference to make me question that assumption.",
