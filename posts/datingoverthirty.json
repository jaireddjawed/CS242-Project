I still do but also decided to burn that bridge after bumping into him multiple times and him not showing me much interest.\n\nHowever, Friday night I walked into a small bar with friends. There was only one guy (Let\u2019s call him K (m31) sitting and talking with the bartender, I didn\u2019t pay much attention to him tbh but I\u2019ll admit from the way he was dressed, he just looked a bit like one of those overconfident self-absorbed gym guys\u2026 I am working on being less judgemental\n\nAnyways we left the bar and one of our guy friends, let\u2019s call him B, stayed behind and said he\u2019d join us in a club later.\n\nB came to the club with K, then B\u2018s girlfriend joined us too. At some point, B\u2018s girlfriend takes my hand and says \u201eYou should hold K\u2018s hand because he likes you\u201c I was taken aback by this and just awkwardly starred at him for few seconds. We continued dancing but after a while I said I was going home. K asked if there is anything he could do to make me stay longer, I said no. As I was about to walk away I turned back and asked for his contact then I left.\n\nSaturday, I contemplated whether to text him or not but ended up texting him about how nice it was to meet him etc. After few texts, he invites me to join him and his friends for a show later. I agreed but honestly wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to but I was like WTF let me just go.\n\nI went to the show, met his friends and everyone was nice and welcoming. It felt like we had known each for a while, everything was just natural. We even broke the touch barrier with holding hands and by the end of the night they wanted to go to more places but I don\u2019t drink much, so I wanted to go home and sleep. He walked me to my taxi, I have never done this before but it felt natural to kiss him which I did. I had not felt that much chemistry with a guy in a long time and it helped that we didn\u2019t meet on an app.\n\nThen yesterday (Sunday) we spent the whole afternoon in a coffee shop just talking about everything under the sun. Nothing felt forced, even silent moments were not awkward. Safe to say everything went amazingly well buuuuut \n\nK is not a typical guy I\u2019d go for. He is into metal music, has multiple piercings,lots of tattoos, all of which are minor compared to his sexual kinks. He is into kinky\/ BDSM sex and my experience has been pretty vanilla. While I\u2019m open to trying stuff when we do get into that point but I feel intimidated just thinking about it. I feel like he will either be disappointed, I may get hurt or both.\n\nWe shared a lot of common hobbies though and he open up about a lot of vulnerable topics which I love.\n\nIt\u2019s still too early and although we talked a lot about sex as well a sexual health, we both agreed to take time to get to know each other first.\n\nAnyways my question is, am I setting up myself for failure here or am I overthinking this too early?\n\nThose into BDSM, how was it dealing with someone who had zero experience?","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1678642783.0},{"title":"I tested my profiles in another state and was shocked by the results","author":"Any_Scratch_5169","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/11pvpcd\/i_tested_my_profiles_in_another_state_and_was\/","text":"**tl;dr: I changed my location on my Hinge & Bumble profiles in NYC for 1 week and received 75 likes on Hinge and 70 on Bumble, after receiving 5 (FIVE) likes combined in an entire month where I live in Florida.**\n\nI posted a profile review recently, made some revisions, but nothing had changed in terms of my results. A friend came up with the idea to switch my Hinge location to NYC to see if my results were any different in one of the biggest cities in the US. \n\nI was stunned to see the likes then just come pouring in. Apparently my alter ego in NYC could've been going on dates with multiple lawyers, doctors, and even someone who had a TedTalk with millions of views. In total, I got 145 likes in 7 days. What's more: I had the premium version of Hinge during my last few weeks in Florida. I let it lapse and so I was entirely on the free version in NY (I was on Bumble premium for both). So much for that theory about Hinge holding back matches until you pay.\n\nThen I remembered that I don't live in NY and was stuck here in Florida. I was crossing fingers that the week in New York would at least boost my elo score for when I switched it back, but it's once again a ghost town on my profile.  Still not getting any likes (I did get 1 like this week from someone 10 years older than me haha) and my feeds are full of women I would not be interested in. How could I be so much more popular in one place but non-existent in another? \n\nI am still having trouble processing both ends of this: being popular in NY and invisible at home.  I almost would have rather gotten no likes in New York -- at least then I'd know I could make more changes. I honestly just don't know what to do next now.

I realized a girl I was seeing was involved in a situation I was uncomfortable with. I told her if we were only involved sexually it was none of my business, but if we were going to be together romanticly it had to go away. She was embarrassed and said she hadn't been in that situation since she found out all the details of it which weren't known to her prior.\n\nOne day she says she isn't quite sure how to handle ending it and I don't push, just say she can discuss it with me if she wants. Less than a week later she says he called her and says his life exploded and she says this is the perfect jumping off point for her and so the situation doesn't exist anymore. \n\nOn social media I saw I was either blocked or her account was disabled. She said she disabled it because she was tired of alerts on a site she wasn't active on. Then I noticed the same from his account. I'm a pretty rational guy, in touch with my emotions and able to separate myself from my emotions when need be.\n\nBut I completely lost that ability as I imagined them both blocking me as a workaround to our situation. I had a friend check out their profiles to see if they truly deactivated them or if I was just blocked. They are both deactivated. \n\nI feel so dishonest for doing this. We started out because we were both willing to be so honest and vulnerable with each other and we developed a trust that I immediately violated. I want to tell her I did this. It will make me feel better. It will make her feel anywhere from neutral to crushed, and I have to realize her feelings need considered too. Honesty is the best policy 99% of the time, is this a 1% time where I carry the guilt without expressing it?\n\nTLDR, I'm not smart enough to sum up this situation into 2 sentences.","upvote_ratio":0.65,"created_utc":1678656949.0},{"title":"Girl very engaged and chatty during week, disappears at weekend","author":"LaCaipirinha","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/11p7gdb\/girl_very_engaged_and_chatty_during_week\/","text":"Been chatting to a girl online for just over 2 weeks now.

In fact, I just got back from a solo vacation in Hawaii and went to Canada a few weeks before that. \n\nFor whatever reason though, apparently I hold absolutely no value to women in the dating world because of my lack of relationship experience; or that\u2019s how it seems to me. I mean, I have dating experience, I can be pretty funny and I\u2019m not socially awkward either.

I (33f) have been surfing this sub for a while now, and have noticed a trend among the redditors offering up advice.

I know the first time can be a little weird so it\u2019s not a big deal, but now it\u2019s been almost a week and he hasn\u2019t even tried to hook up again even though he\u2019s still texting, calling, and making plans together, so I know he\u2019s still interested. We are seeing each other on Thursday, but he made a comment to me last night that we \u201cdon\u2019t need to hook up every time we are together\u201d, almost like he\u2019s preemptively telling me he doesn\u2019t want to hook up when we see each other which was disappointing because I thought we for sure would. \n\nWe had talked about what we liked in bed a little before the initial hook up, and one of the things he shared is that he and his ex would have sex 3-4 times a week. He had told me a few other things about his preferences\/past experiences, but it seemed like we may need to manage expectations a bit so we\u2019ve talked on the phone some this week and discussed sex a bit more (which is when he brought up not needing to hook up every time).

He has reiterated several times he really likes me and that he is really happy with the relationship so far. \n\nAm I reading too much into this? Do I need to give him space until he is comfortable or just rip off the bandaid (with his consent) to try again? Will I be able to help guide him with what I like without it being blatantly obvious I\u2019m coaching him based on previous sexual experiences that he\u2019s already insecure about?\n\nI know I need to have another conversation with him, so I\u2019d just really like advice on how to approach this while respecting his boundaries, ensuring I advocate for my own needs, and don\u2019t make any of his insecurities worse. \n\nAppreciate the help!","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1678299841.0},{"title":"When (if) you would want someone you\u2019re dating to disclose a previous assault?","author":"DaughterOfTheFall","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/11m31aa\/when_if_you_would_want_someone_youre_dating_to\/","text":"As the title says, I\u2019m curious about how you feel about women sharing previous experiences of sexual assault.

Posted here before. I (32F) have been dating (28M) for a little over 5 months now, our 6 month anniversary is in two weeks.\n\nIn the beginning, around the one month mark, he was having doubts about being with me all together. I asked him if it had to do with the way I look (I was about 150-152lbs at that time, I am 5'4\"). He said, yes that might be part of it, because he generally likes taller women who have toned bodies. I posted on here that I wanted to get more serious with my weight loss journey (I went down 70lbs at that point since May 2020) and that my boyfriend (he wasn't my boyfriend at the time though) would be supportive of my weight loss journey. Everyone here said this was a huge red flag on his part to suggest I lose weight or that my weight was an issue and that my weight probably wasn't even the problem. If you see my pics, I look decent and good for my age and my body isn't horrible, just not a super toned fitness girl. So I got upset with the feedback (as in I started to feel bad about the situation) and I confronted him on a phone call and I said it's unfair he has these conditions about my body while I don't have any for him and if he lost his abs or something happened and he gained weight I wouldn't care and I would still be with him. He said that wasn't the real reason and he felt cornered to say it was about my weight but in reality he is unsure about dating ME. So then I told him how much he means to me and how much I do care and that we always have such a great time when we spend quality time together and that I would always treat him respectfully and nice, etc. Whatever I said really resonated with him, he began to cry, and told me he was an idiot for not seeing what a great woman he has right in front of him. He said I am beautiful and so caring and so good to him and he felt bad for doubting me and he asked me to give him a second chance, and I did.\n\nWe talked about the \"weight\" issue and he said that I should do whatever I wanted to do regarding my weight, it should be for me, and if I decide I want to lose weight and tone (which he knows that's always been my plan to get to 130lbs and tone) that he would be supportive of me but my weight is a non-issue and not a dealbreaker.\n\nLast night we were texting before bed. I was being silly and joking and asked him how he feels about me from a 1-10, and if he's \"still an 8\". I was just teasing. He said he was and I said, great, how can I maintain that for him? And then he said to continue being myself and reaching my goals with a variation of the happy face emoji. I immediately felt turned off and asked if my body was an issue. He said no, it wasn't. I told him I can't just reach my goals and get all toned right away. He said he knows and he'll be patient. So I then asked him why he mentioned me reaching my goals. He said he likes so much about me, find so many qualities about me attractive and \"can still find me sexually attractive\" but reaching my goals could help in terms of sex in the long term it could be an issue if I don't reach my goals but that \"I don't really need to worry about that because he likes the intimacy between us\". I got offended and I asked him to tell me how the sex would be better. He refused to give me any answers. I asked again, he dodged the question. Then, we were going back and forth and I guess arguing, and keep in mind I just got my period yesterday when all this was happening and I was feeling sick to begin with.\n\nHe then panics and types \"I love you\" and then he follows up with that I mean the world to him (I believe that but I called him out for lying and him saying he loves me when we both know he's not there yet). He said he wrote I love you because he thought he was losing me and didn't want to lose me over this. I told him that was very irresponsible for him to lie like that. I continued telling him that I lost so much weight in two and a half years and I still need to lose 8-15lbs more (I am currently 138lbs and lost 14lbs since we starting dating) and tone and that takes time and he has to be patient with me. I reminded him how much I care about him and all the good things we had with each other for the past three months and he said, \"that's what I've been trying to tell you, you are wonderful and I wouldn't trade you for anyone ever\". He still didn't touch about me not being his type physically and how me losing 8lbs and toning will dramatically help the sex. He lied and said he loved me when he admitted he doesn't love me. He knows I am so close to being in love with him so that was really irresponsible on his part to claim he does.\n\nHe says I am beautiful, I have a cute face, a nice chest (I do have nice boobs lol), a cute voice, great personality, and other physical qualities he loves about me just NOT my body overall. He's not understanding why that hurts me and makes me feel insecure about myself. My body is the one thing I am insecure about even at 138lbs and so close to the 130lb goal.\n\nThe pattern seems to be to this: he tries to motivate me to go to the gym (we have worked out together three times in the past month), he tells me I am doing a good job with my dieting, and he will nudge and say things regarding me reaching my goals. I no longer want him to mention anything about my weight loss journey. It makes me feel I'm on some sort of deadline (even though he said he's willing to be patient but then he also said if I don't reach my goals it could impact the sex long-term, so what am I supposed to believe?). My body keeps coming up. He said to me once that one day when I am closer to my goals I'll look so hot in yoga pants. Excuse me? I actually already look great in yoga pants. I told him this and he apologized and said of course I look good now. He keeps doing this thing where he says something (you'll look hotter when you XYZ then say, oh no you are so beautiful to me) or he'll be like, when you get slimmer I can pick you up easily and kiss you, stuff like that. It happens every so often and sometimes I talk to him about it other times I just feel defeated and don't say anything.\n\nFor the record, yes, he looks great. He has a toned athletic body and he is tall. He has abs. He's been an athlete most of his life. I also used to be incredibly fit and toned, then life happened, and now I am down over 80lbs and still isn't enough for him it seems. He says it is, that he likes how I am now, that he will be supportive of my journey to reach my fitness goals, and that the way I look isn't a dealbreaker. But then he goes around and says things like \"it is impacting the sex\" or how much better I would look if I was closer to my goals. 138lbs is not a lot of weight imo. My BMI is normal. I lost 82lbs total, and 14lbs while with him!\n\nIf he truly loved me or really liked me, he would never give me feedback about my weight like he did. I asked if we could FaceTime tonight and talk everything through and that we both need to be honest and truthful and answer all questions asked, no dodging answers. He agreed. He said I completely misunderstood everything he was trying to say and he wants to explain himself.\n\nThis is the second huge bump we have had regarding the way I look. His type is taller toned fit women. Then why is he dating me? I'm shorter 5'4\" and I am not some fitness chick with a toned body and abs. He said he loves so much about me that transcends the body and even sex. He keeps saying he loves the intimacy between us but I think he's not being completely truthful. He says I am so beautiful and he can find me sexually attractive. I still feel, again, he's not being totally truthful. Or he is but he wants more from me, I don't know. I will have a better understanding of all of this (again) tonight.\n\nWe are supposed to spend the weekend together. I'm hoping we can really get down to what it is that is making us go back here for a second time and come to some resolutions and boundaries.\n\nAnd I already know the majority of you will tell me he is a straight up AH. But before this argument last night, we had something so amazing and wonderful for three months. We never argued, fought, we had lots of sex and intimacy, we did so many activities together, we laughed together, joked together, talked about our feelings and the relationship together, celebrated anniversaries and Valentine's Day together, we have met each other's families, we went to dinner with my parents already, we've cooked and baked together, it was truly a wonderful time. He was so caring and thoughtful, he gave me gifts, he wrote me amazing cards, and he would always compliment me on how beautiful I looked to him. Things were so great. But this issue is the last time I want to be speaking of it. So I will see how our FaceTime goes and see if either we can spend the weekend together or if I need some time to think things through. He says one thing then contradicts himself over and over again. I just need some truth and clarity. And if you go to my profile, I posted on Tinder my profile except in those photos I am 150ish lbs but that's how I looked when he met me and I am down now to 138lbs.\n\nIf you want to comment on that he's strictly an AH with nothing else, I get that, I do, but any actual comments that can help me address this with him tonight on our FaceTime would be really appreciated. I plan on asking clarification questions and setting some boundaries. If you all have ideas what I should ask or say, I'm willing to to read and see if that could work.\n\nEdit: We had our FaceTime call last night. We talked for an hour and a half. I let him start things off. He apologized and said his intentions were never to make me feel bad about myself or that he wants me to lose weight, in his mind he was trying to be supportive and motivational and realized that this wasn't the case and he won't be speaking about this topic like he was before. He also said he really is attracted to me as a person and sexually and if he wasn't he wouldn't be with me in the first place. He said he understands why I am upset, but he also brought up a good point which was when I asked him what I could do to help him maintain feeling strongly towards me what he said was \"keep being yourself and work on your goals\" and instead of me taking that in a good way I immediately got offended and went straight about my weight which he made clear was a non issue and not a dealbreaker by any means. I agreed that maybe I went overboard and I made it so quickly about how I look and we spiraled from there. We were both emotional and crying on the call especially in the beginning. I told him my one insecurity is my weight and I am working on loving myself. He said he wished I loved my body how it is now and no matter what he is here to support me. I also told him about the I love you moment and he apologized and said he really thought he was going to lose me two nights ago. He said he is very close to being there naturally and would feel fine to even say it to me. My boundary was that we would not talk about my weight but we can talk about goals and fitness and work out together and I can always update him where my goals are at from time to time but no more \"weight comments\" even though his intentions weren't malicious. He said he loves so much about me, including how I look, and when I told him I lost 14lbs since meeting him he said he was so proud of me and he is so sorry for upsetting me. I picked him up and he stayed over with me last night and this morning I had personal training so he came to the gym with me. We both agreed on some things: for him to be more mindful for what he says to me and try to not talk about weight and for me to work on my insecurity, to love myself and my body, and for me to not put him in these difficult corners and getting upset when he's trying to be honest or communicate with me. He said the sex comments were not what he really meant at all he just felt attacked by me and had no idea what he was supposed to say. We made up last night, had a great time, and had a great morning, and I'll see him after work and this weekend. We were able to really talk things through and I realized I have my own work to do to make this a healthier relationship, not just on him.","upvote_ratio":0.32,"created_utc":1678394914.0},{"title":"Pointing out flaws in things your match likes - why?","author":"anonymal_me","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/11l33w1\/pointing_out_flaws_in_things_your_match_likes_why\/","text":"Looking for other perspectives on a situation that\u2019s come up a few times now with new matches.\n\nI match with someone and we\u2019re still feeling each other out in the first few messages.

We made it official as of last week. I've known since I started dating him I would have to fight a lot of battles of my own. Which is fine, I've been doing it alone up until this point truly anyhow...I just had hoped partnership would make it less lonely when I do.\n\nI find myself when I'm alone, I'm battling some intense feelings, I don't wish to bother him...sometimes I get this feeling like I shouldn't be bothering him with any of it. I also can help but shake this feeling that he doesn't actually love me the same way I love him...and I can't shake it.\n\nShould I keep on keeping on? Everything else is great. Should I keep myself reserved, or tell him I'm struggling? Ive never been so sure about someone I've dated before, however I can't help the feeling he's not as sure. I can't tell if it's relational trauma he's experienced in the past, or if he's just not as into me as I'd hoped, or what...\n\nHe doesn't want to tell me he loves me yet, I'm sure I love him, and I'm damn sure I could love him forever. I texted him that I loved him last night with my sweet dreams message...it went completely ignored and my heart hurts. \n\nI feel foolish and I don't know what to do. Is it just because we're at that stage of the relationship? Am I overthinking things? Or is it possible my fear is true that he doesn't actually like me that much, and just enjoys my companionship?\n\nEdit as responding to individual comments is just not going to happen immediately.\n\n1. I'm in therapy. I'm aware that I have an anxious attachment style, And I have quite a bit of relational trauma from past relationships that I am still working through. Unfortunately therapy is also expensive, I am only able to afford once a month at the moment. \n\n2. Thank you for the humble rain back down to earth. One of you said anxious spiral. And I think that term definitely depicts what I was feeling earlier today. \n\n3. I spoke to him about what I was feeling, and it went really really well. He was able to ground the situation, and I think of course it deserves future conversations around emotional support versus codependency and creating a healthy long-lasting relationship.... However I think this was the first stepping stone to get there. \n\n4. I'm really grateful for those of you who said to speak up, And I'm really grateful for those who reminded me that it is still new.\n\n5. My past relationship ended because after 10 months, there was still no conversation about building a future together. And eventually I got so frustrated that I was just sad all the time. I didn't communicate with him honestly about what I was feeling, and he felt frustrated most of the time. Eventually he broke up with me because he said that I was too emotional for him. And I completely get that. I would like to create healthier relations, and I recognize that being open honest and vulnerable will do that for me. My past relationship I did not speak up, about what I was feeling. Some may call this one of the four horsemen of stonewalling. I have to agree that it's a relationship killer.\n\n6. Reddit as much as I can't stand you, like an older brother who's brutally honest... I also love you. And I mean that. I may be more generous with my love than others feel comfortable being so.... However I am fervent in my belief that my capacity to love is as great as my capacity to grieve. And in that I will not be afraid to love in the way that feels right for me. Because truly at the end of the day I do know that I'll be okay. No matter what. \n\n7.

From a big picture goal, we seem to want the same things, have the same hobbies, similar personality types. We talked about long term relationships at the beginning.

We discussed what we were looking for both before we met and since. We were both clear we weren't jumping into anything and would take our time to get to know each other before being intimate at all.  I was clear I don't want to sleep with anyone unless we have genuinely gotten to know each other and are on the same page about what we are looking for, etc. He is quite interested in me and making it known. \n\nDate one was probably two days into us talking; he drove to me in my city and took me for dinner. We live about 45 mins away from each other at decent traffic times. Dinner went well, there was no kiss or anything, it felt all very refreshing. \nThe next day I was working from a coffee shop, and he suggested he come out and see me for a little break in the day. He came to me in the town over, another say 10 minutes further for him.. again, it went well. It was feeling very refreshing, to see effort, to be chatting with someone on the same page, and to know he has his shit together. Afterward, he said he had wanted to kiss me, I told him I wouldn't have stopped him. \nWe met a third time, which truthfully felt like too much for week one of talking, I'm pretty busy this week, but I squeezed it in, we went for another dinner, I was on the road that day so I went to him this time. Everything was going smoothly, the date was nice.\n\nHe does have a problem with interrupting it seems, and changing the conversation to him and a related story about him, without letting the other person finish, which is where some apprehension came in. I asked if anyone has ever mentioned he interrupts people a lot, he said no, apologized, and said he would work on it.\n\nThroughout, he has been communicative that he is very interested, wants to put in effort, and is wanting to get to know each other better before hopping into bed.\n\nThen last night he says, and I quote, \"I'd suggest letting me come visit you. But you would have to agree to alot of making out and not wearing pants \ud83e\udd23 to make it worth the drive\"\n\n\nLike.. to literally be a grown ass man and tell a woman you're only worthwhile if your pants are off?

I have some major work events this week, and my business is taking off in ways I never imagined (literally just last week, very unexpectedly), so I'm heeeectic busy right now. We hadn't made any plans yet and he said he was going to do xyz if I was going to blow him off.. I asked if he expected me to keep his days off open and he elaborated that if I wasn't going to see him he was doing something else. I said well yeah, if you make plans with me, I'll see you, but if you're just expecting me to keep your 4 days off open, in case you want to see me... then no? I don't bail on plans or blow people off, but you haven't actually made any plans with me. He called me bossy, I replied \"what?\"..  all of it seemed childish, and... controlling? Manipulative?

She's also very cute, has amazing curves, and the physical attraction is mutual, so that feels nice. However, I have noticed that all she does is talk about her ex or her daughter throughout our conversations.\n\nShe has told me her split was amicable after she and her ex simply grew apart and she no longer felt like they even had a relationship, but it does seem like when she tells me things, she's not necessarily having a conversation with me and rather just talking to me about what went wrong in that relationship. I also totally get that her daughter is a priority, but it can feel like she is more likely to tell me something about her daughter than herself.\n\nToday felt like day where I realized that things were probably not going to improve in the conversation. Every message since the day started has been about her ex or her daughter. How she started the day by taking her daughter to a kid's birthday party. How she is too kind because she went over to her ex's new apartment to help him build furniture and chalked it up to the fact that she was doing it for her daughter's sake. When I mentioned what my dinner plans were, she replied back about what her daughter eats and how she prepares it. I get it: Her daughter is a big part of her life and there's some transitional baggage leftover from the ex whom she's been formally divorced from for almost a year now, but it's like I can't steer the conversation toward anything focusing in on just her alone.

I've taken down the links b\/c I think I got the input I needed.The consensus was to change up my photos and modify my prompts to be more personal, vulnerable, real, and fun.**\n\nA couple of thoughts while I have the room:\n\n* I don't ascribe to the narrative that a strong ambitious woman is emasculating or unattractive to similarly ambitious men. All my girlfriends are killing it with their respective partners, I'm probably one of the last single ladies standing. Still I agree that my profile needed to show more of my personality and what I value in a partnership, outside of my ambition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The world is different for successful women of color, including myself. Two things I didn't share is that I bust my ass to get where I am and climbed professional ladders that were never intended for me. There is no fallback, I only have myself.  Y'all want soft women, but society has made it hard for us. My work is more than just a job and paycheck, I'm trying to solve social problems and teach future leaders so that the world is a little better for communities like mine. I hope a future partner celebrates my journey and career goals, it's part of who I am and what make me tick. If they don't care, or it's not important, or if its intimidating, then they aren't the one for me. If you think I'm intense, you should meet my mom, tias, and cousins who are the matriarchs of their families-- the stereotype that Latina women are passive is wildly inaccurate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I'm a normal person, I go to the grocery store and Target and have too much laundry waiting to be washed and my car needs an oil change. But I also want to feel like I'm living my life to the fullest, if I go out tomorrow my obit should read \"she lived her damn life.\" I'm not competing with friends or other women. See above about experiencing life as a woman of color, my ancestors and I didn't do all this just to let life pass me by. The crumbling pressure of capitalism and life in the US takes away our magic, we often only have the energy to get from work-to-home but I refuse-- I hope you refuse too in whatever way that looks for you. My new profile will hopefully attract a person with this same energy.\n\nI hope this gives you insight on the intense women in your life and who you come across in the apps.

I think everyone deserves partnership but most of my matches just don't seem as interesting, attractive, or as successful as where I'm at in my life (e.g. guy with photos of bottles at a club\/in front of cars or; construction worker with a super bland profile and bad pics). Most of my messages, with clever openers or questions, to people who I do think would be better fits are unreturned. Lots of first dates are also pretty lackluster, nice people but few spark my curiosity or romantic vibes.\n\nI am a confident person, I know what's for me will come but I am also busy and want to live my live, rather than swiping and messaging everyday. I'll date any race\/ethnicity . I think I'm good looking and carry myself well, but not skinny\/blonde\/white. Similarly, I'm pretty flexible on height and body type, I'm attracted to confident men even if they don't fit society's standard of male attractiveness.

Prior to Covid I'd had several dates, but only 2 serious relationships, both of which ended via ghosting. I recognise I am very emotionally scarred from the experiences. \n\nI recently matched with someone who seems nice, not terribly physically attractive to me, but okay. Previously, I'd only matched with people that I thought were very physically attractive to me, but I decided that my matching criteria was obviously flawed given my failures in meeting people I'd want to date, and the eventual poor decisions of the people I did date. \n\nWe've spoken a fair bit, he sends me lots of messages in the days since we matched, and he's asked me to dinner which I've agreed to (that's happening in a few days time). I've passingly mentioned I'll send him art that I like in the mean time until we meet, or agree to the video calls he wants to do. Because of my work and personal (and family) health circumstances I wasn't able to send him the art I was fond of nor could I take the video call we scheduled until an hour after agreed. I was still messaging him, but only in the evenings when things died down on my side.\n\nHe then sent me a long message saying he wasn't sure about \"this\" if I was someone who didn't carry through when I said I'd do something (he was referring to me not sending him the names of the art and landmarks I was fond of and the fact that the video call was delayed (potentially due to be postponed) because I was dealing with a request from my family to tend to my terminally ill cousin). I had to eventually explain why I wanted to postpone the call, which for me was uncomfortable. I hate talking about my cousin who I know I'm going to lose, let alone tell this all to someone who is a stranger to me. He ended with, I'm not trying to make you think you are a bad person. The arrangement for dinner still stands. \n\nTo clarify, we have been speaking for a total of 6 days having matched.\n\nI feel really overwhelmed. Its been lovely matching with someone who sends plenty of messages (he's demonstrated he is keen unlike what happened with my prior boyfriends), but I also think, we don't owe each other anything yet? Why are you already calling me out on being flaky before you even know anything about me and my life? Normally when I match with someone, when we eventually agree to see each other, we sort of leave it at that, a few messages here or there exchanged, until the day we meet and see if we get on or not.\n\nIts triggered thoughts that perhaps I'm not suited to dating if this is how things start? Maybe I'm not loveable? How are other people simply getting on and dating and picking themselves up and finding new people to date? Am I in the wrong for not engaging in these video calls constantly or by taking too long to send him things like the art that I enjoy?\n\nFor now we have plans to have dinner soon, and I made an effort to send him messages early this morning.

We want the same things in life and our values line up very well.

While not addressing it directly, she has been putting out the feelers for exclusivity over the last few dates, on our last date telling me she had deleted her dating apps. I skirted round the issue and did not deal with it directly but I don't think that's fair. I wanted to give this relationship time to work out but unfortunately, I don't think my feelings are such that I see us working out long term.\n\nWe never talked about relationship goals but I came into this looking for something serious.

So I am trying not to do that going forward. I feel like I have given this the honest space and effort for my feelings to form but unfortunately, I am not there and don't think I will be. Also, I've previously let versions of these types of budding relationships turn into longer situationships, where my head and heart were not really in it and which could have been ended much earlier and with considerably less hurt feelings on the other end.

Ultimately, this was a straightforward situation where I liked this woman at the beginning, decided I was going to make a proper go of it, gave it the time, energy and care it deserved (have not slept with anyone else during this time), before ultimately concluding that this is not a good fit for the long term and it's unfair on her to continue any longer. She told me she deleted her dating apps two dates ago but made no demands and said nothing more. She actually said that I could keep seeing other people (should have mentioned that above). This was kind of in passing and we\u2019d had a few drinks at this stage so I did not address it there and then. Needed time to think, especially to consider if I was ending it simply due to my previous avoidant tendencies. You can\u2019t make a decision like that on the spot or even overnight. That\u2019s not fair on her or the relationship, is it? In the week that followed, I reflected on it and saw her once more where I thought about telling her but still hadn't completely decided on what I wanted. Now I have.\n\nTo the folks saying I have been stringing her along since the dating app thing, we\u2019ve only slept together once since then and isn't somebody allowed a little time to reflect on what they really want? Don't all relationships move to higher stages when one or both communicate that they want to step it up? This is what's happening here. It's only been seven weeks! We don't fully know each other and in my mind, this is a very normal and healthy stage in a relationship to be having a talk about whether or not both parties are ready to take it to the next level. In this case, one of them just happens not to be. That's life. Isn\u2019t that how healthy relationships are supposed to go? Do you think nobody gets hurt and everyone is supposed to live happily ever after? Do you think it would have been better for me to bail earlier so that she would not get hurt, even though I was still fully engaged and wanted to move it forward at that point? Do you think I'm somehow obligated to hang in there now just because we had sex and I should not hurt this person? Do you think that not having sex until later would have somehow made me commit to her? Some of the comments are baffling.\n\nOn having the DTR earlier. Maybe we should. But we are grown adults and neither of us decided on that until date 7 when she mentioned the apps (on reflection, we are 8 dates in at this point). But even if we did have the convo earlier like date 2\/3, I would have said that I wanted something long term (I did) and we would have continued along before inevitably getting to the same point we\u2019re currently at. So it would not have made one bit of difference.\n\nAlso, the level of knee jerk hypocrisy in a minority of the comments has been really eye opening. Everyone rushing to second guess my motives when if it was a woman in my place that ended a relationship at date 8 and after sex had occurred (happens literally all the time and to me more times than I can count) then do you think she would be accused of somehow \u2018using\u2019 the guy as I am being here? Absolutely not.\n\nOn the avoidant thing. I\u2019m also surprised at the level of second guessing and rush to blame here. The negative commenters simply refuse to look at the facts of what happened and are sure this is the avoidant me with the same problems. Do you know how avoidant me would have handled this six months ago? I would have either bailed after date 2\/3 when I felt like I could potentially cop feels for this person and there\u2019s the possibility I could get hurt. And when I say bailed, I\u2019d have just faded her out or made her end it through my overt show of disinterest, like I essentially did with the woman in my previous post 6 months ago. Alternatively, if I\u2019d got to this stage at date 8 and now decided that I was no longer into her, then I likely would have kept seeing her because it\u2019s still fun and it does not look like she has any plan to place demands on defining the relationship at least for now. Then I would have bailed at month 4\/5, again by just fading or pissing her off such that she ended it for me. I certainly would not be doing what I am doing now, ie proactively communicating and ending something pretty much as soon as I don\u2019t see a future in it. Isn\u2019t this the opposite of what avoidants do? That is, proactively engaging with difficult conversations instead of pulling away or ghosting? I don\u2019t care what any of the negative comments say, it\u2019s clear to me at least, that I am making good progress.\n\nI texted her that I picked up on the dating app thing and that we need to talk, asked if she wanted to talk on the phone or meet up, and we will meet tomorrow for a chat (not a date). Also, texting has been much less frequent this week and maybe\/hopefully she has sensed it and got a heads up to prepare. Thanks to everyone for the constructive advice.","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1677781525.0},{"title":"Does \u2018right person, wrong time\u2019 ever eventually work out & you find your way back to each other?","author":"mildlyperplexing","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/11frxyc\/does_right_person_wrong_time_ever_eventually_work\/","text":"Someone posted yesterday asking what are people\u2019s 3 best questions to ask when dating.

I have REALLY been struggling with it. It's not just the kind of loneliness where you can hang out with some friends and move on with your life - it's that loneliness that craves to be desired; the loneliness that picks up your phone excited to see a text but nothing is there; the loneliness where you're laying in bed at night wanting to feel someone's warm touch on your skin and hear them talking to you about literally anything. \n\nI'm cultivating a great relationship with myself through a lot of self care, affirmations, and pursuit of my goals, all of which have greatly benefited from therapy. I feel great about myself and every time I reach for that affirmation, there's loneliness sitting there waiting to invalidate that feeling with a dismissive, \"Oh yeah? Then how are you still single, especially considering the fruitless effort you've already put into dating? \"\n\nIt's been a real struggle to not let that demotivate me and, at times it still does successfully. I'm hoping to find some ways to cast a new light on that feeling as new perspectives seem to be really powerful tools for me. As an example: my therapist helped me realize my procrastination habits are rooted in survival instincts to avoid pain and I make a judgement that what I'm going to do will be painful before I even start so - she helped me reframe it with a mantra of, \"I love this pain\". I use it when I'm feeling that pain of getting something started which forces me to analyze why the hell I would believe something like that, which in turn helps me recognize the value of pushing through. So, my internal (or sometimes external) monologue evolves into, \"I love this pain because through it, I gain...\". \n\nI'm making a lot of progress in that department but, this feeling of romantic loneliness is so persistent, pervasive and perturbing - it can really disrupt me in the moment.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677699939.0},{"title":"Would you feel comfortable having sex at your partner's place if their neighbor(s) always heard you?","author":"brodentein","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/11foqyv\/would_you_feel_comfortable_having_sex_at_your\/","text":"My friend recently was telling us about the time she was annoyed with her then-boyfriend when she first found out from him that his downstairs neighbor could hear them having sex because the insulation between the floors apparently wasn't the best.

Dont get me wrong. it is very nice but I feel like I wanted space, he worries I would leave him.\n\nExample was 2 nights ago, he was out with his friends and i tried to call him, he didnt picked up, i assumed he was out and having dinner (time difference) i texted him afterwards saying enjoy the night. i proceeded to sleep. I tirned off my wifi (i do this sometimes when i dont want to be bothered) and slept for 9hrs, I was so tired at work! When I woke up, i made myself coffee, do my morning routine without checking my phone. When I checked my phone I saw multiple missed calls from him and texts. He even got his friend back home to check up on me, he was worried something happened to me. Hmmmm, i dont know what to feel. I re assured him and he told me he didnt slept the whole night trying to get a hold of me. He was so worried that I finally video called him, he was so frustrated but relieved,  he told me he almost smash his phone out of frustration, as he is so far from me, if i decided to leave him, he cant fo anything.  I re assured him im not going anywhere. He was fine afterwards.\n\nHe told me, why does he feel like I would leave him anytime? That im not serious about him, that I am not that excited about him. I am. But idk why he feels like this. He said, he is scared of how much he likes me that if he let himself completely vulnerable towards me, I will wreck him. He is thinking longterm with me and he doesbt know whats going on in my head most of the time.\n\nHe wants to introduce me to all his friends and family when we both get back, he asked me if im ready. i said okay.

We have bumped to each other 3 times. First time since we had drinks was last week Saturday. I walked into a bar and he was with his friends. None of my friends had met him, so we ended up sitting on a table next to them. It was during his time that someone from his table started screaming my name and that is how I got to know that we have a mutual friend. For clarity, I have been in this city for 6 months and met her  on Halloween, we kept in touch and had brunch. They don\u2019t follow each other on Instagram so I didn\u2019t know they know each other.\n\nWhen this happened, I was too anxious to make eye contact with him but ended up passing behind him to get to her, so I said a brief hello and went back to my friends.\n\nThen on Friday my friend invited me for drinks, when I walked in he was there with his friends. We ended up meeting in the bathroom, small talks and some jokes were shared. I went back to my friend, we were seated at the bar so at one point he was ordering drinks and made funny faces, I laughed and he came over and introduced himself to my friend. This part had me in my feels because they got along very easily for those few minutes. Seeing these two people I care about interact made my night.\n\nThen yesterday my other friend had a bar crawl birthday celebration. He was in one of the bars. I walked in, immediately saw him and waved. He waved back, few minutes later I\u2019m in the bathroom. He walks in and starts cracking jokes.\n\nWhen we were leaving I went to him, gave him a hug and said goodbye. He lingered a bit and ended up meeting my two other friends. This time I had to do introductions because one of my friends said in a different language \u201cis this your man?\u201d And I said \u201cHey (name), this is (man name) my friend. I said my goodbyes and left with my friends.\n\nI hadnt told him about my feeling yet because I wanted to take time to dive in deep into myself and ask myself what I want and how i will deal with rejection.\n\nI honestly don't know how he feels about me. He was very pissed at me when we ended things and was like that for a while.

This was even the case with my grandparents, so much so that they died hours apart just like some Notebook shit. It was truly beautiful (although sad too).\n\nIt's fucked me up having those being the examples in my life.  I have had to work through it in therapy that this is not how most dating experiences go. Even more so because that's exactly how my ex and I were when we met. We moved in together 5 days after meeting and were together for 8 good years.  So my brain has been wired to think that this is how dating should be. but most people today if they want something super serious after one date its a red flag. Which i understand can lead to extremely manipulative behaviors and end up being a toxic relationship.  I do not disagree with that at all either.\n\nAre you a \"if you know you know so go with the flow\" type person when it comes to dating or are you a \"there's several standards and boundaries we have to determine before dating\" type person?

I have noticed for myself in the past that when I develop feelings for someone I do tend to get a little anxious about my attachment. I am overall very secure & confident in myself but in these early days I find myself feeling worked up about whether or not I'm second-choice\/second-fiddle to someone else.\n\nI operate under the assumption that everyone is seeing multiple people (I mean, I am too), so why do I get so worked up about the idea of others dating others at the same time? I feel like a hypocrite.\n\nI don't have issues casually dating or keeping emotions out of something that I don't see a long-term future in, but I find myself already unrealistically projecting onto this woman I'm into things like imagined futures, whether or not her messaging\/texting is indicative that she's seeing someone else, or whether she's still into me, etc. And we've only been on 3 dates.\n\nTL;DR: Normally very secure, level-headed, can casually date multiple people at a time and enjoy myself, but as soon as I get attached, my emotional brain takes over.\n\nAny advice (particularly from men) on combating this? I am still seeing other people but I am definitely investing most of my time (and at this point, thoughts) in this one woman.\n\nMany thanks. I love this sub.

It's hard for me to respond to everyone after a long day of work, but I'm gonna do my best to respond to the comments that speak to me most. That said, I didn't seem entirely clear in my post and wanted to clarify a couple things for context. I'm not sure I understand the comments asking me to 'grow up' or telling me I'm trying to 'have my cake and eat it too,' or that I'm jealous or possessive. I'm in no way trying to prevent this woman from doing as she pleases; I'm only looking for advice on how I manage my own feelings\/emotions around it. It's a new feeling for me, I haven't felt attracted to anyone\/felt like I had feelings for someone for a good year now, and that includes a lot of dating here and there. So for me this feeling of insecurity\/anxiety is very new and I believe it's mostly wrapped up in the fact that like someone else mentioned, I fear rejection from this person in particular. I've been rejected\/turned down, ghosted, cancelled on, etc. tons in the past; it doesn't phase me; I feel like this one would. So here I am. Anyways, thanks again for everyone who took the time to comment. I must say that a few of the comments strike me as a bit off base, accusing me of having an unhealthy or toxic personality simply because I'm admitting I feel anxious and insecure and I'm looking for helping managing those feelings. That seems odd and lacking in understanding to me.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1677159456.0},{"title":"Definition of Being Independent as a Girl","author":"KaynadianHKer","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/11a9k55\/definition_of_being_independent_as_a_girl\/","text":"Late 20s girl interested in seeing how men 30+ define \"independent.\" I've come across a few profiles now of men in their mid to late 30s seeking for an independent girl. I'm just curious what they mean by that as I feel like being independent can really vary.\n\nA bit of a background, I'm an asian girl in her late 20s who still lives at home. The reason I live at home is probably because asian culture wise, girls don't move out until they get married. I don't plan to live at home forever, especially if I don't meet the one. But it's not exactly set when I'll be moving out. I initially had hoped like many cousins, I'd move out when I get married and meet the one lol (and obviously that hasn't happened yet). I also was dating a fellow between my mid 20s and he was in medical school, and didn't know where he'd end up so didn't want to settle down until I knew. But we broke up last year. After a break, I felt ready to start dating again and realized the expectations vary amongst ages.\n\nMost men around my age and early 30s don't seem to mind it. But I found mid-30s to later 30s men seem to tell me that they want someone independent without giving me a solid definition.\n\nTo be fair, I don't see myself as dependent. Yes, I live at home. But I contribute a lot financially to everything at home. My parents aren't fluent in English, so I handle a lot for my parents and family. I have a job which I think is pretty stable and a retirement pension. I've been saving so when I meet the one we can purchase a home together. I have my own plans and activities, yet I value spending quality time with my family. But living at home, my cooking skills and other skills are obviously much slower than those who own their own place. But I don't see it as an issue. I trust when I move out, I'd be able to cook and learn. But living at home, my mom would do majority of the cooking. With that said, would this be a major turnoff for men 30+?\n\nJust curious! Regardless, I don't feel the need to move out simply to meet the need of someone who wants someone independent, but I am curious how guys see this on apps. Thanks :)\n\nEDIT:\n\nThanks so much everyone for the feedback! :) Really appreciate it! Dating in my late 20s is very different than dating in my early to mid-20s lol. But the conclusion I've come to is the term independent can highly vary amongst people. However, the general definition seems to be able to take care of yourself financially, have your own friend group and hobbies, and etc. The level of independence seems to vary slightly depending on the individual as to how independent they want their partner to be, but a broad view is just having your own interest, being able to take care of yourself, and having financial independence.","upvote_ratio":0.61,"created_utc":1677188370.0},{"title":"Thinking about someone you very briefly dated , a lot","author":"Amazing_Statement629","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/119vuqc\/thinking_about_someone_you_very_briefly_dated_a\/","text":"Okay, so.. does anyone here ever feel this?

He was depressed and had panic attacks constantly. He gained 80 pounds. I loved him and really cared for him, but he was struggling mentally. (He is still struggling and jobless 5 years later). \n\nOne of my boyfriends I broke up with because the sexual chemistry was lacking and we were only having sex once a month and I became so unhappy. I ended the other because we were at different places in life. He was a bit younger, and wasn't ready for the things I wanted.\n\nRecently, I dated a guy for three weeks and had to end it because he was completely un-empathetic to me breaking my arm on a solo trip abroad and said some cruel things instead of just a nice, hope you're ok which is all I needed. Another three week thing ended because I developed feelings and he wanted to keep sleeping with other people. \n\nI just ended things with my most recent boyfriend of 4 months because of communication issues and him snapping at me over little things. Up until those things started happening I was so excited and felt like he could be the one because of our insane chemistry, sexual and personality, and we were on the same page about relationship goals and lifestyles.\n\nI'm starting to feel like, if it wasn't him, then who could it possibly be? I've dated so many freaking people, and there is always something wrong in every relationship. I'm becoming so discouraged and feel like a failure. Everyone around me has a partner and a family, and it just feels like something is wrong with me that I'm still alone. Am I just picking incorrectly? I tried to ignore the sexual chemistry part in favor of a really great guy on paper, and that obviously didn't work. I now know it's important to be attracted to someone and have that sexual chemistry for a relationship to work, but that's not easy to find in itself. And then all the other things have to align.

I would see anyone taking longer than 48 hours to read a message as an outlier, even if busy with work etc., and over the boundary into rude territory - but I\u2019m interested to hear where your set point is?\n\nWe agreed we do not have the same expectations for communication and that would be prohibitive to fostering a friendship but I am curious as to how many common that level of interaction is. I know it varies but to me it seems unusual\u2026 trying to work out if I need to adjust my expectations at a population level?! \n\nPlease no comments about overthinking this particular exchange or hoping for a different outcome.

Those who responded with your interpretation as to what it meant\u2026 that wasn\u2019t what I asked. However, the majority of these replies came to the conclusion that not even opening a message that he knew was there for >48 hrs was a sign of disinterest. \n\nThe plot twist is that this is *exactly* how I interpreted it and he got mad at me, claiming he did really want to foster a friendship. He believes it is entirely normal to not check\/read messages for days (note: reading, not replying\u2026 I\u2019m used to giving leeway for replies). My experience is that most people check daily if not more, even if replies take a while so this being \u2018normal\u2019 didn\u2019t feel right to me. \n\nAs a result, what I was asking for here was people\u2019s opinions of \u2018normal\u2019 to check I wasn\u2019t way off, as my perspective is easily skewed after a prior relationship involving gaslighting. \n\nThe guy in question and I have already agreed not to try to pursue a friendship or anything more (this was mentioned!).\n\n*I won\u2019t be replying to any more comments, particularly those talking about message response times as that was NOT the focus on my question.

I've always wanted more of a relationship person but have been open to the casual thing while dating.\n\nI (35m) matched with this woman (42f, I\u2019ll call her L) back at the end of June. Met on bumble, chatted for a couple days, had dinner a couple days later. We had an instant connection. Incredibly interesting, kind, smart, funny, beautiful. Weirdly enough, she thought the same of me.\n\nOver the next couple weeks, we saw each other frequently. It was awesome.\n\nI felt myself not being able to match her energy and we stopped seeing each other, but kept in regular contact. \n\nI took a month off of dating. I was pretty disappointed in myself for not being able to reciprocate what she was putting in and wanted to reevaluate my intentions. \n\nI started dating slowly again. Met some really great women. I could never really replicate the connection I felt when meeting   L. Not that it was boring meeting these other women. I feel like I can have fun and good conversation with just about anybody. \n\nWell a couple weeks ago, I started feeling that the idea of dating was starting to feel like a chore. I was getting bored of meeting somebody online or in person, asking the same questions, trying to force the connection I\u2019m looking for and just realizing it wasn\u2019t happening. So I paused all my profiles. \n\nL and I are still in regular contact. We both keep pretty busy. We both have kids and jobs, etc. \n\nLast week she asked about how last Sunday was. Super Bowl is a holiday for me. It was the last planned date that I had. It was one of the most fun dates that I have ever been on. Still, no romantic connection to the person though. I started to think about it on my drive home. How I just wanted to feel that connection I felt with L again and how high she set the bar.\n\nSo, I told her that. I told her how heart of a time I had on Sunday but I had no plans of seeing that person again. She asked why and I just let it out. \n\nI told her that I had been trying to replicate this connection that I had felt with her and while it is possible, that every time I\u2019m out on a date, I was wishing it was just her there with me. \n\nShe asked to come over and talk and that\u2019s what we did. \n\nThoughout the last couple of years, I\u2019ve been in therapy figuring things out about myself. Part of that is being able to express myself and not letting the fear of being vulnerable overtake the wheel. \n\nSo we\u2019re currently exploring of being together is what we both want. \n\nHave you ever tried to rekindle an old flame? Or been in a similar situation?

And because of it not being reciprocated, I\u2019ve stopped myself being affectionate as well, now it\u2019s all feeling very off (at least to me).\n\nWe only see each other once a week, if that. In the beginning it was mainly me initiating it and admittedly now I\u2019ve kind of stopped so it\u2019s been mostly him asking if I want to do something. It\u2019s all very casual.\n\nI\u2019m honestly not sure if there\u2019s enough there for us to \u201cwork on\u201d, but he\u2019s a great guy, very nice person, and I want to give this a fair chance. We have a lot in common and we rarely run out of topics to talk about, but it\u2019s also all very superficial, he doesn\u2019t really try to get a little deep in conversation. When I asked he said he\u2019s into me and into this and it\u2019s just not in his nature or personality to be super affectionate and he\u2019ll try, but I feel like the actions don\u2019t reflect the words. The sex is not good either.\n\nI understand how this sounds like an obvious \u201cjust break up\u201d post, and I guess I\u2019m 75% there already but (as a lot of you will probably understand) dating is horrible nowadays, especially after turning 30.

Things were looking very hopeful until he had to travel for work after the holidays and the communication just declined. After having a talk about intimacy\/vulnerability, or the lack of it outside of the physical, he shared that he might not be able to be as vulnerable as I would like. He also mentioned that he did not want to be a boyfriend and said that he was feeling \"pressure\" when I was just desiring a check-in and a more clear set of expectations for us both. He pretty much shut down and wouldn't express himself.\n\nI was expressing what was not working for me - lack of communication, uncertainty about how often I should expect to see him, etc. When I asked him what was working for him (which he'd said he liked how things were) he could\/would not say, but kept asking me to repeat myself and I started to feel overly exposed. I suggested we get off the phone because \"this wasn't working for me\" (the conversation or how things had become, of which I communicated in the moment). We didn't talk for most of the next day so I reached out via text expressing how I was not a fan of the way our last two conversations ended and was open to offering him space if that is what he needed. He expressed that it was - that it seemed we'd come to a head - even after saying that he was really enjoying how things were going.\n\nI agreed to \"taking space\" - he was going on a trip for two weeks so we wouldn't be seeing one another due to that anyway. I did reach out once before he left asking if we were really \"taking space\" and the response I got was very cold. That was the end of last month. He went on his trip and is now back, but I have not heard from him. It'll be almost 3 weeks of not talking and a month of not having seen each other. I feel like I have been ghosted, but I'm not 100% sure. We never specified any amount of time, but I am getting to a point where it's really getting to me and I would like clarity. However, I don't want to reach out because I did once before and it was as if we'd never shared any sweet intimate moments. Should I reach out to confirm the seemingly obvious or just accept that things are indeed done?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Wow. Leave it to reddit to offer up some very harsh truths, even when tone is giving insensitive. However, I appreciate the responses because I was feeling very dumb about not admitting the obvious. I guess I would've never seen this as a breakup because the relationship was undefined. No less, I am feeling resolved, after a few good cries,  which is what I've been inching towards these past few weeks.

I also have a tendency to get intimate fairly early on (historically within 2 - 5 dates) which means having the exclusivity talk quite quickly.

And to my surprise, the number of matches and dates I have had here compared to my country is really high. But please don't get me wrong. I don't want to sound like an ego douchebag here. \n\nThe thing is. I could say that I have constantly been dating someone each month, and then something happens like she gets distant, doesn't want a serious relationship, get back with her ex-bf, and lastly, I lose interest in her (that already happened to me twice).\n\nI've been trying to analyze what could have been wrong because the behavior is so weird. To put a few examples. I was really into one girl a few months ago. Everything was amazing. One day, she sent me a voice message planning a trip in her car, picking me up at my apartment, etc., and two days later, I received a long text message saying this was going too fast for her. She's not ready for something serious, that her ex-bf situation is complicated, and so on. I was so surprised because I was totally not expecting something like that, and we were constantly dating for maybe one month. \n\nAnother example could be that I got hospitalized for kidney stones on New Year's Eve. At the time, I was knowing a girl who offered to visit me at the hospital and even bring me some of my stuff from my apartment. That was such a nice gesture because I was struggling at the time. After a couple of days, we continued dating. We had sex, and a couple of days later, I received a long text message saying she didn't feel a connection and we shouldn't continue dating and not going to lie. That created a bit of insecurity in my sexual life.  \n\nAnd lastly, this happened to me today. After like two weeks of chatting with this new girl, we went on a couple of dates last week, and we saw once this week. It was pretty consistent, and she was the one that planned the dates. I didn't want to push too hard there. So, last Monday, she went to my apartment, I cooked something, and it was a lovely night. We kissed, and I got the feeling that everything was good. Today, again, a long message saying that she's overwhelmed with social life and she doesn't want to disappoint me because of that. \n\nAfter all of this, I don't know what's happening, and I'm starting to think it's my personality. I can get a lot of second and third dates, but something is definitely going on when things start to get serious.

I'm also a former English teacher and expat with significant experience working in her \"dream career\" after living abroad. Her father, who knows me from a professional relationship with my family, connected us in order for me to provide her career advice as he'd very much like her to return to our home city.\n\n**First Meeting.** When we first met for tea her first week back, things were \"business informal\" as I discussed the sector, potential opportunities in higher education, and potential introductions with leaders in this \"dream career\" space, especially since she may come home in as early as six months. I was struck by her kindness and beauty, and we began to discuss interests, hobbies, and the personal nuances of returning home after living abroad. We decided to extend the meet to lunch at a nearby restaurant, and by the end of that, we hugged and I asked her if she'd like to go on a \"real date\".\n\n**First Dates & Managing Expectations.** Five weeks, eight dates, and three sleepovers later, and we're now comfortable describing ourselves as \"dating\". We had a particularly special Valentine's Day since, normally, neither of us go out of our ways to celebrate it. However, we've managed our expectations throughout this entire experience, and she's made it clear that she's not guaranteed that she'll return in six months. Moreover, we'd both set out to work on ourselves, enjoy being single, and avoid the dating space before, coincidentally, meeting each other and reconsidering those endeavors. She's expressed in various ways that she simply isn't comfortable committing to any sort of relationship, or even the possible promise of a relationship, before returning abroad. I'm strangely at peace with this, mind you, and genuinely appreciated and enjoyed her company, physical affection, and emotional connection without expectations, though we're clearly growing more fond of one other during this time. There was an unusually steady sort of maturation in our friendship and relationship that I've rarely, if ever, experienced - such that we'd been on over a half dozen dates before we'd finally slept with each other on Valentine's Day. I've never been on that many dates before sleeping with someone. \n\n**Developing Feelings.** Tomorrow is the last night we'll see each other before she returns abroad and, admittedly, I've been feeling a bit down, but I knew this day would come. We exchange some sweet but terse texts before saying goodnight, but I feel compelled to text her a few more sweet somethings but restrain myself. Some time later I receive a text from her saying that she is only now feeling all these emotions hit her at once - she wanted to wait until she returned to really experience it, but now she is crying, feeling \"grateful and overwhelmed\", and \"deeply affected\". I call her.\n\n**Defining Our Relationship.** At this point, we're still lightly treading around discussing the future. I have told her not long before that six months to finish her teaching contract is not a long time to wait, especially for someone like her, and that it's something I'd further discuss if she wanted that. We talk at length, eventually getting to a point where she wants to describe what we are - for our shared clarity. That is, how she might describe us to someone while she's living abroad. She settles on \"talking to someone\" as a status with which she's comfortable. I'm comfortable with this, and add that, contextually, we might say we are a \"friend\" or \"more than friends\", depending. \n\n**Honesty & Disclosure.** I explain that I have no expectations for exclusivity at this point, but I do expect honesty. This brings us to a point in the discussion where she wants us to define the degree of physical involvement that warrants disclosing it to one another. I'm not comfortable making myself emotionally available to multiple women at once and wouldn't feel comfortable kissing other women, let alone having sex with them, while keeping that from her - which, functionally, is practically exclusivity. She feels similarly with other men or, at least, it's quite a process for a relationship with a man to become sexual, and she's comfortable disclosing that well ahead of time. \n\n**Sex with Other Women.** Where this conversation took an unexpected turn is that she's fairly eager to have sex with other women, such that it is not a process to do so, and she would be comfortable with one night stands and sexual experiences with women that she does not know well or at all. I knew she was bisexual and learned tonight that she had a month-long sexual relationship with another woman fairly recently, which was somewhat of a new experience - she believes that, since it \"isn't emotional\" and \"purely physical\" for her, it doesn't mean anything. I began to get a bit more pensive and explained that it's still important to me. She then explained that, due to her very religious and conservative parents, living abroad is really the only way she believes she can truly \"experience\" this aspect of her sexuality, and part of her not wanting to commit to anything is to be able to have these sorts of experiences with other women. \n\n**How I'm Feeling & Request for Advice.** I'm now fairly confused. I've managed my expectations per her caveats and felt comfortable with the very real possibility of never seeing her again, despite developing some reasonable hope for a possible future together. Even if it's a long-distance \"situationship\" (the purgatorial abyss between \"friends with benefits\" and a relationship) that we'd cultivate over time. But now I'm considering the possibility that she's simply not ready for a relationship or, furthermore, she needs more time to explore this somewhat unexplored aspect of her sexual life that I do not want to impede or stifle, whatsoever. It's made me question what I really want, and whether making myself *emotionally exclusive and available* to someone overseas is really what's best for me, especially if she wants to engage in casual sex with other women. I think I may actually just want to be friends - that somewhere during the course of this conversation, we went from *not necessarily incompatible* to *seemingly incompatible* with only a few utterances. If she could show some semblance of a next step - some modicum of commitment - a token, we could try. But do I even express that? Or is this a situation where my foreboding instincts know better than either of us?","upvote_ratio":0.7,"created_utc":1676533622.0},{"title":"Ladies, how can I make my gf enjoy a weekend getaway?","author":"TiedHands","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/1137ukz\/ladies_how_can_i_make_my_gf_enjoy_a_weekend\/","text":"Next weekend, im taking my girlfriend on a weekend stay at a super romantic bed and breakfast.

We had a brief but very special bond but I broke it off after he told me he can\u2019t fall in love anymore. We have a mutual friend and he wants to stay involved in my life. Is he using his Trauma as an excuse or does it seem like later down the line we could become something?\n\n\n\nI (36f) met a wonderful, sensitive and funny (39) man through our mutual good friend about a month ago at a party and we hit it off immediately and spent the night and all of the next day together. We had this instant closeness and companionship that really surprised the both of us. \n\nI knew he was a father of a young child, but it wasn\u2019t until we started hanging out regularly that he told me about his actual situation. \n\nHe was never officially with his ex, but she basically tricked him into believing she couldn\u2019t become pregnant (yes, he\u2019s aware he also has responsibility in this) and then she did. He communicated upfront that he definitely wants to be involved in the child\u2019s life but that he wasn\u2019t in love with her. She started using her pregnancy to her advantage and basically forced a relationship on him if he was to have any custody of the child. He stuck it out until his son was 4 months old and then broke it off with her and moved out, because I guess she was quite awful to him. \nOur mutual friend who has known him since childhood recently mentioned that while all of this was happening he was quite traumatized and lost a lot of weight. \nI never asked for details because that\u2019s not my place but it is clear that she really pulled a number on him. \n\nFast forward to now: he loves his son more than anything in the world and only cares about his well being. She lets him see his son very rarely and is extremely controlling of their hangouts. \n\nIn the span of 4 weeks we hung out 2-3x a week, always a sleep over, always cozy and casual in joggers and just having a really sweet time. I am also dealing with a terminally ill father and he has been so calming for my nervous system in so many ways. \n\nHe never once made me feel like he wasn\u2019t feeling anything towards me. He texted regularly, we both instigated meet ups and we talked about doing future things together like bike trips, even hanging out with his son (who is 2.5 now).\n\nIt was my birthday last weekend and the topic came up of him joining with my friends ; that\u2019s when he dropped the bomb that he can\u2019t and won\u2019t fall in love with anyone right now. His main priority is his son and getting more custody rights. He loves spending time with me, feels safe and close, says I\u2019m the first person he\u2019s been sexual with since all of this happened with his son. He wants to continue hanging out with me with or without sex, but needs me to understand that he can\u2019t build anything with me. He needs get his life and head in order before any romantic interest can be in the picture again. \n\n\nI have never been in a situation like this before. I absolutely adore and in no way am I upset with him for putting his son first. But I told him that because of my father and the last also traumatizing 7 dating years for me make me very careful about continuing a situation that is not defined. I need support and stability and can\u2019t handle if he says he wont develop deep feelings for me at some point. Told him it\u2019s early between us but I do have feelings for him that will become deeper if we continue this. \nHe told me it\u2019s not about meeting up with other women, but can\u2019t give me more right now. \n\nI told him it breaks my heart but if we want to really be friends, then I need some time and space apart from him and to not contact me for a while. Told him I would reach out when I was feeling \u201elighter\u201c about us. \nHe said he totally understood and will respect my decision but to please reach out if I need him \/ can be there for me. Says he\u2019ll be happy to hear from me when I do. \n\nI know I did the right thing for now- we are both, but especially him, not in the right space for a relationship. But I also do wonder deep down, if this was just his way of gently saying he\u2019s not into me (enough). \n\nI absolutely do not want to force a friendship as long as I still have feelings for him and I don\u2019t want him to ever think I\u2019ll push for one but after so many failed dating attempts, I feel like I can\u2019t trust my instinct on who is emotionally available or not. \n\nI\u2019m unfortunately not in the mood at all to try and date other people right now but I do really need some advice on how to let guy out of my heart. It really felt like it could have turned into something special \ud83d\ude14\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWow, wasn\u2019t expecting such a big resonance to my post. Thank you to everyone who so thoughtfully responded. \n\nI feel much better now about breaking things off when I did. It is unfortunately a pattern of mine that I get involved too quickly and it is something I am really trying to work on; I am noticing that the common denominator is always alcohol. When we met I was in absolutely no way trying to date, but I guess the night we met we were both so starved for intimacy that we BOTH let things go too far. This is not just on him, I could have also easily asked him during our meet ups what we were doing. I was trying to feel him out myself when it was him that dropped the bomb. \n\nI truly believe he not ready to get involved with anyone because of his past relationship. My two good friends who know him well (who also have a kid) and also know his ex, confirmed that he is a really good guy and that what happened was and is horrible. They don\u2019t really understand why he says he can\u2019t love, but do we ever really know the people in our lives? \n\nEither way it doesn\u2019t matter. I have deleted his number and am moving on. It will take me a few weeks for this to settle but I know I\u2019ll get over it. I have other men in my life whom I\u2019ve had feelings for that I\u2019m now great friends with and I think in due time, if we both want it, a friendship could happen.

I don't want to come across as too eager or pushy, so I try to get to know the person over the course of a few days.  However, more often than not, the interest is gone by that point.

Both had busy days yesterday because Valentine's Day fell on a Tuesday, an otherwise busy day in their normal daily lives regardless where they each have their own combination of commitments between work and afterwork responsibilities. One couple decided they were going to do Valentine's Day at their own convenience and their own timeline, so they celebrated it a few days early on Sunday with going out somewhere special, eating great food, and then the rest of the evening\/night spent together at one of their places.\n\nThe other couple decided they needed to do Valentine's Day on the designated day. They don't live together, both have jobs that don't align in their schedule, and had evening commitments they couldn't cancel on. They don't normally see each other on Tuesdays, but because Valentine's Day fell on a Tuesday, they forced a short, late night hourlong get together at 10pm which according to one of their Instagram posts resulted in one of their downstairs neighbor texting them at 11pm to keep the noise levels down because the music and their talking was too loud.\n\nTo me, the former scenario sounds so much more fulfilling than the second, especially since Valentine's Day is one of those commercial holidays that is kind of just there for profit and make people feel like they need to do something for their partner on a designated date, or else they're not really into each other or some b.s. I get the sentiment, but not at the cost of stressing out your day or doing something at the literal 11th hour before the clock strikes midnight.\n\nWhat do you all think? Is Valentine's Day so important that if you are in a couple, you need to recognize it on the day it happens even if it's not the most convenient day to celebrate?","upvote_ratio":0.59,"created_utc":1676467722.0},{"title":"Daily sticky thread for rants, raves, celebrations, advice and more!

It happened, and the pieces fell into place so beautifully. We began seeing each other 2-3 times a week, texted everyday and just had so much fun together. I was always so excited to see him and we had so many adventures planned for spring and summer. I have never been so attracted to someone and have never felt so comfortable with anyone so quickly. He was everything I ever wanted: kind, patient, thoughtful, creative, and so funny. I was starting to see a future with him and marveled at how wonderfully our lives could mesh together. I thought had finally met my person. \n\n\nA little over a week ago, I showed up at his door because we had plans. I hadn\u2019t heard from him in two days, which was odd because he always responded to me. When i hadn\u2019t heard from him in the first 24 hours I started to worry but thought maybe he was just swamped at work. I had been busy with work too, so I didn\u2019t have much time to consider it. But when I never heard from him the day that we had plans, I knew something was wrong. I called and knocked on the door more times than I could count before I finally called 911. They had to break down the door. He had passed away in his sleep.\n\n\nThe last week has been a blur. I cried for probably the first three days alone. On the fourth day, I met his family for the first time and we hugged and cried together. I went with them to receive his ashes from the funeral home. I helped them pack up his apartment. I had one last dinner with them last night and they leave today, taking the last bit of him with them. \n\n\nI didn\u2019t realize how much you could grow to care for someone in just 4 short months, and how painful it could feel to lose them. I\u2019ll never get to see his face again, touch him, or hear his voice. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever date again, because all I would want is for them to be him. And I\u2019ll never meet anyone remotely like him ever again. \n\n\nI miss him so much.

I feel frustrated and unsupported by my friends who thought this situation was hilarious and made jokes that I'm an \"ice princess\".  Is this normal for dating?? I can't imagine thinking this behavior is acceptable.\n\nEdit for Update: thank you so much for all the support. I feel good that I left early. He texted me in the middle of the night last night a bunch of profanity and calling me the c word and I just blocked and ignored him.  I am able to laugh this off more now but do still think it's important to evaluate my friendships as I was already doing this before with this particular group for other reasons. I will screen people a lot more heavily now with video\/ phone calls and waiting longer to meet them. I deleted the apps  because I didn't feel comfortable and safe. After a long painful marriage and being so happy single, I'm not in a rush to disrupt that too much. Again, thank you all so much for the support and suggestions!!","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1676255028.0},{"title":"Guy best friend wants to be my plus one at a wedding.

I have decided to only date with intention so after two dates with this guy I asked for specificity about what he\u2019s looking for (his profile says not sure). He said that he wasn\u2019t opposed to a relationship but that he didn\u2019t know how much time he could invest right now. I say that\u2019s fine, we can give it a shot and if it doesn\u2019t work then fine. Most of all I wanted to let him know that I wasn\u2019t sleeping with anyone new unless there was a potential for a relationship. I went out of town for a week for a work and we texted every day. Two days after I got back we had a great third date. We made plans to go out again last night but on Friday I decided I really didn\u2019t want to get dressed and go out so I suggested we just get pizza and hangout at my house. The plan had been for us to end up here anyway. He said that sounded good and that he also wasn\u2019t feeling up to going out again. I let him know that I typically don\u2019t go out super often but I was avoiding at home dates because I hadn\u2019t been ready for sex and for me home dates lead to sex. I said that since we were going to be crossing that bridge anyway we could start doing more cozy dates. I spend the day yesterday get prepared for our \u201cbig night\u201d and I was feeling so excited about it. He came in and seemed a bit awkward at first but he is like that every time we meet. Not super unusual. He meets my dog, we talk, and eat pizza. Finally I put the dishes away to initiate the rest of the planned evening. Before I can say three words, he says that he doesn\u2019t actually want to be in a relationship and that he knows I only want to sleep with someone if that\u2019s where it\u2019s headed. He\u2019s says \u201cI guess this could have been a phone call.\u201d  I\u2019m like fuck yeah it could have been. Then it just got kinda awkward and silent then he asks if I want him to leave. I\u2019m caught off guard so I just say no you don\u2019t have to leave. We continued to talk for another hour or so. Finally he leaves and kisses me when he goes. \n\nI was genuinely shocked at how this unfolded. On Wednesday he had said that he would like to go to the symphony with me when the season starts. He then sent me some pics of his kitties. It all felt so damn cutesy. \n\nI woke up early this morning and texted him that I don\u2019t think it be wise for us to stay in contact. I said that I am not looking for friends, especially one that I saw a potential relationship with. Not to mention he said he did want to sleep with me but didn\u2019t want to give me the impression that he wanted a relationship. So in no way would that have been a healthy situation. I also told him I really didn\u2019t appreciate him coming over to my house just to tell me that he didn\u2019t want to be in a relationship. I reminded him that I told him on Friday that I had a hard time doing home dates without it leading to sex so he put me in an extremely difficult position. Not only did I have to strongly assert my boundary, I had to spend the next hour trying to not change my mind. I told him that I wished him luck in whatever life brings, but I\u2019m out. \n\nThought I might have actually had a date on valentines this year\u2026denied. Back to the drawing board I suppose.\n\nEDIT: Y\u2019all I realize he could have lied and slept with me anyway and I appreciate his honesty. I told him as much. He wanted to be platonic friends and I said that if we wanted to sleep with each other, platonic is not going to work out. I wish I had met him at a different point in his life because I truly enjoy him as a person.\n\nEDIT 2: Thanks for all the robust responses, genuinely. I went into the night under the impression that he was interested in seeing where this goes, I was mistaken. In hindsight I wish I wouldn\u2019t have used such harsh language but I was hurt that he waited until I leaned to say that he doesn\u2019t want a relationship. I\u2019m only now trying to date with intention. I was a late bloomer and had a lot of casual sex for awhile. I\u2019ll get better.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1676225278.0},{"title":"Daily sticky thread for rants, raves, celebrations, advice and more! New?

The difference between the roles is mostly benefits and more stability. It was originally a spot  open to everyone and because it was a general position, she had to study various parts of economics and do research as well and had to work and study through the holidays. When end of Jan comes for interviews her department head decided to make it even fairer by not allowing internal employees to apply since it gives \"unfair advantage\". So basically she wasted 2 months of prep and work for nothing. She did say she may have a chance to do well in june by working on her current project and if it becomes important she could potentially create a staff position for herself. \n\nShe also mentioned that she is in better mental state now since the prep period is over so that's good.

We had 2 Mondays so far, 1 was teahouse and 2 was exhibition and dinner. I walked her home both times, had great chats. I asked when she is free next week so we can plan something again... and she kind of ignores me. 2 days after I send her some info of my week plans, letting her know I have some free time, but I am a busy man otherwise, have lots of thing planned because she is not answering. Then she sends a breakup text like:\n\n1. You work out a lot I am not --- I workout in a gym 4x a week and 2x I have yoga. Nobody asked her to join me at the gym, she does pilates and I would have been happy to switch to pilates just for her, or maybe she could have joined me for yoga. I thought this is a common interest. But I am not looking for a gym buddy.\n2. You work on weekends and nights, I am not and will not, our worktimes differ too much --- I do work a lot I agree, but because I am not meeting her and I love my job I thought I can work a bit more, who asked her to work on weekends, and why does she not tolerate if I do this while I am not with her? I told her I am a highly flexible person (I do not work a 9-5 job) and I work in a very demanding field. I work because I want to, and with her I would balance this better of course. But until we are not serious, why would I cut off work?\n3. You go to clubs and parties and I do not --- Nobody asked her to join me... I understand that if an adult is busy, and is single they need to cut things down to fit someone else into their life. The first thing would have been to drop the parties for her. I like many kinds of music, she seems to like just a few. But is this a dealbreaker? I do all kinds of things, classical concerts even. This is not a common interest, but is different music taste a deal breaker?\n\nLiterally she asked after 2 dates to free up my calendar completely for her to fit in. All while every time we went out, I was there, I never rescheduled and I made me free that day. The second date she literally picked the next Monday on Monday as she was busy most probably on other days? I told her I am flexible and I like my time to be spent with activities and interests, not alone at home doing nothing, and of course if things get more serious, gradually we both need to make effort to accommodate each other in our lives. Now it seems for her this is already a turn-off? I though if someone does not do anything in their free time, that is a turnoff... I suspect of course she is not feeling it, and wants to end and try someone else. And that is fine, I did not feel it either, but I wanted to keep going to see if there is anything. Maybe this is basic incompatibility?\n\nJust putting this out here for comments.","upvote_ratio":0.46,"created_utc":1676224253.0},{"title":"Wanting children, but only with a good connection. 35 year old woman feeling like I am running out of time.","author":"Suspicious-Ability91","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/10yus7g\/wanting_children_but_only_with_a_good_connection\/","text":"Hi all,\n\nI feel extreme sadness nowadays. \nI have always known I want children and a good partner to grow old with. I have a good job, amazing friends that fulfil me emotionally and am running my first half marathon as well as learning guitar. But I struggle with meaning in my life. I have gone to therapy to resolve my families impact on my psyche. Many people look to me for advice and I tend to be non judgemental knowing that we all suffer. \n\nBut I also wish for an emotionally available partner who puts the relationship on a good foundation with me. I spoke to 200 guys on the phone and met about 50 in the last three years. Recently I met guys that I did click with but no chemistry, Three times I met guys that where a match two of them turned out to not like me back the same way and where emotionally unavailable for a good two sided relationship. One guy adored me but was focusing on career being both a professor and a startup founder and had no time. We still speak and I understand. I can\u2019t deny that I feel a certain amount of frustration being in a dating pool where one half feels pressure because of their biology and the other half still has time to either figure their issues out or focus on work. It leaves me feeling very uncertain how to proceed. For three years I focused on dating with no results and I can\u2019t continue living like this. It feels like I am stuck, but at the same time I don\u2019t trust that the right guy will just fall into my lap. \n\nI am scared I never was focused on my career and have always put relationships first, as I know their contribution to happiness I am not ashamed of being this way. I also believe the city I am living in might not be conducive for me to find what I am looking for as it\u2019s very high achieving and everyone looks like a super model. I look good am doing well but certainly not supermodel. Plus the city is quite conservative and I am more open minded, but still conservative in my relationship outlook. I feel like so could do better in another pond but also have amazing friends here. Though I don\u2019t want to rely on that as they might move at some point. My home city feels a bit small to me now as in it served an old persona of myself not who I am now.\n\n\nMy questions are the following:\n1. I feel like I want to secure myself in a way that enables me to have a kid alone worst case. Which would mean moving back home. At 35 I might have another shot in another city before. What would you do?\n2. What are you considering when making the choice of whether and when to have a kid alone?\n3. Would you risk moving to a new city if you would experience dating in such a bad way?\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nEdit 1: \nI feel I have to clarify since it came up multiple times:\n1. If I don\u2019t feel chemistry but other things where good I went on multiple dates. If it feels like I am kissing a sibling I don\u2019t continue.\n2. Conservative: ENM has become very prevalent in my age group. I don\u2019t do that. \n3. 200 people and phone call. Originally I went on random dates soon after matching, it wasted a lot of my energy. Calls are not interviews they are cocktail party conversations and I am pretty decent at making people comfortable during the call even if they are shy. Most people have no issues with the call itself and are actually grateful I asked.\n\n\nEdit 2: Wow, I have to say one thing. Regardless of the situation the replies here made me feel so much less alone in this. I wish for all of you wonderful people to find what you look for.

I don't know if I need advice, plain reassurance, or words of wisdom perhaps, but at my age (late 30s F) I still haven't got it figured out. I've been single since 2014 and haven't made so much as attempt to date until pretty recently; essentially I raised my one child to adulthood and worked on finding basic contentedness in life. I'm actually pretty happy overall: I've been working in a job I generally enjoy which energizes me, I'm physically healthier than I've been in a long time, my family is doing well, etc.\n\n\nBut I'm lonely as fuck! I don't have a huge social need- I exist rather happily without friends as I'm a loner introvert and get just enough social interaction with work buddies. But romantically, sexually, there's this emptiness in my life I very much would like to fill. And not just for the sake of doing so (as in, to avoid loneliness). I so miss having that person to bounce ideas, jokes, anything, off of everyday. I so miss physical contact in all forms. I miss having that *connection* with someone who \"gets it.\"\n\n\nThe thing is, I don't know that I trust myself enough even after so many years of building up to a place where I'm generally secure and happy with who I am. I don't trust my ability to choose a secure partner, as my previous relationships (a decade or more ago) were fraught with issues. More often than not, the men I was attracted to\/attracted\/ partnered with were the \"avoidant\" type if you follow attachment theory. Lots of hot\/cold, inconsistencies, instability. All I want now is the exact opposite! But I'm still noticing a similar pattern when I meet men IRL recently: meet decent guy, notice that he appears interested\/attracted to me, get to know him, become attracted\/ return interest by escalating my attention\/flirting, at which time he'll back off. \n\n\nWhich leaves me feeling like a) they weren't interested to begin with and I suck at picking up signals, or b) they're the exact avoidant \/unavailable types I very much am trying to, well, avoid. I'm a bit despondent and feeling like I have no idea what the hell I'm even doing or why I'm bothering as being single hasn't been horrible. I just...want to love someone and be loved, in a romantic sense, you know?\n\nI'm sure it doesn't help matters that I've been out of practice for so long. I'm reluctantly considering OLD but not eager about it. I really can't gauge attraction based on photos, and the newer dating apps really seem to limit how much you write, and honestly the fucking \"prompts\" demanding a witty concise sentence stress me out. So we'll see. \n\nI don't know, I'm sure most of us are here on DO30 because we're still trying to work this shit out, but hey, if anyone has any suggestions, thoughts, pointers on recognizing secure, consistent men, whatever, I'm all for it.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1675992585.0},{"title":"Daily sticky thread for rants, raves, celebrations, advice and more!

He then suggest we meet up next Friday at my favorite bar which he hasn't been to yet but would love to go check out, and I agree.\n\nLater that day I messaged him and tell him that there is a small bistro next to my office where we can meet for lunch but because of my short lunch break, that's the only possible place for me to have lunch. He agrees and we see each other the Wednesday. It goes well.\n\nDuring the Wednesday lunch date he asks if I'm still up for Friday. I am, and then he suggest that I stop by his restaurant for a glass of prosecco before we go off to the bar. I show up on Friday evening just before his shift ends, and he introduces me to his boss and all his co-workers. He gets me a glass of prosecco and then I wait alone at the restaurant bar while he finishes off his work. It took about 20 minutes, I finish my drink. He then gets us a table and orders himself a drink and I get a 2nd one. All is still good.\n\nWe head off the the bar, I have slightly too much wine, we have our first kiss while a live band was playing. He asks me to join him for brunch the next morning and I happily say yes. Later I realized that I am getting a bit drunk so I tell him that I want to go home. This was about 4 hours after we met up that evening. He asks me if I have wine at home so we can have another drink at my place, but I said no. I only met this guy a week ago and I wasn't ready to invite him over to my place just yet.\n\nWhen I got home I messaged him that I'm home safe, thanked him for the evening and tells him good night. No response. I'm pretty sure I was home before him because I live much closer to the bar than he does. The next morning he messaged me to confirm brunch plans. Brunch was good, but I could only stay about 2 hours because I had some things to do. When we said goodbye I was ready to give him a kiss but he gave me an awkward hug.\n\nDidn't hear from him the rest of the day but he was working so that's fine. Sunday evening I message him after he was done with work, we have some chit chat over whatsapp, and then he stops replying. The next morning he messaged me \"Sorry I fell asleep, have a good day\". I reply wishing him a good day too. Haven't heard from him since. I initiated the last text conversation and sent the last text, so I was kinda waiting for him to send the next message but it's just complete silence from his side.\n\nIt's been 3 days. Should I message him again? I don't want to seem desperate. I really did like this guy and I'm wondering if I did something to put him off?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: UPDATE: So I messaged him. Just a short and to the point \"Hey, how's it going? Would you like to go out again?\" He read the message shortly after, but took hours to respond. (He was online several times before responding and I know he was not working in that time). He replied something along the lines of (I'm translating here, English is not my first language) that I seemed bored and uninterested during our brunch date. I apologized to him if I came across that way, assured him that that is not how I was feeling at all, I was just a bit hungover. \n\nI asked him again if he would like to meet up again, and he just did not reply. So I blocked and deleted his number the next day. Some people have pointed out that I might not have seemed interested enough in him. I think I showed enough interest, I payed for myself during the 2 of the dates, offered to pay for the other 2 (he paid for lunch and brunch but my part of the bill was only around $5 each time). I initiated the hugs, complimented him and flirted with him, suggested places to go and things to do on future dates, etc. \n\nI think, like many have suggested, that his interest shifted after I didn't let him come home with me. That he felt rejected and that's why he was acting awkward during brunch. At the time I just thought he was a bit hungover too.

A little over a year ago we dated for a few months, but discovered we weren't compatible as partners (we have completely different goals and values, and there are some other lifestyle incompatibilities). We deescalated from dating to a FWB relationship for a few months, then stopped sleeping together when we both decided we were ready to date other people seriously. We don't have romantic feelings for each other and both agree that we would be terrible partners: even though we work well as friends, we have far too many incompatibilities for a relationship to work. \n\nThe last person I dated was pretty intimidated by this friend. After I had introduced this girl to my friends on a couple different occasions, I mentioned to her that this friend and I had briefly dated, that we decided it didn't work, but that we have kept up a very good friendship without either of us having anything else in mind. The person I was dating initially accepted this and even said she liked my friend, but it became clear after a few weeks that she was pretty uncomfortable with our friendship. I can sympathize: this is a conventionally attractive person that I see multiple times a week (she works out with my main gym buddy and me, and we sometimes work together in coffee shops). My date eventually confessed she felt like she could never measure up to this person. Even though that's not how I thought about things, she still didn't like the fact that I have a close friendship with someone I used to have a sexual relationship with. \n\nIs this friendship just inevitably going to be a red flag to the people I date? I don't want to end the friendship and I don't feel good keeping it a secret that we used to date. (Imagine if that came out several months into a relationship and I hadn't mentioned it -- it would seem like I had been keeping a secret and then be even worse.) In talking about her to people I date, my strategy has been that after my date meets my friends (including this friend), to mention that we dated briefly and emphasize that we are just friends now. I've tried to play up how incompatible we were and conspicuously mention how much I like her current boyfriend, but that seems not to be enough.\n\nEdit: many thanks for the thoughtful responses, everyone. I talked it over with my therapist, too, and going forward I\u2019ll limit the time I spend with her more. I\u2019ve already deescalated over the past weeks by letting her be the one to initiate texting and limiting my replies, so this won\u2019t feel like a radical shift I think.\n\nTo address one thing that keeps coming up in the comments: Many people have concluded that I am still attracted to this person, on the basis of the fact that I used the phrase \u201cconventionally attractive\u201d twice. I do think she\u2019s an attractive woman, but that doesn\u2019t mean I want to have sex with her or feel drawn to her that way.  I have several female friends and consider more than a few of them attractive as well. My boss is conventionally attractive. Two of my direct reports are conventionally attractive. My cousin is conventionally attractive.

Long distance with him was extremely challenging as he doesn't text, chat or do video calls, God alone knows how can I stay in touch. He has always been a bad communicator. I kept insisting we jump on a call to connect and at one point and also mentioned had I been in California we would have met once a week and that would have helped.

While we were in bed and I threw him the question about how he feels about me and he replied with \"I like you and I enjoy hanging out with you\" I was disappointed that he is still saying only these line after being together for 8 months. We ended up having a serious talk and he said how he  isn't feeling very strongly and that he takes time to develop feelings which seemed fair. Then he made a weird statement about how he enjoys time with his friends more than he does with me, which really hurt me which later he said he said \"poorly phrased it\". In the end he asked me \"do you want to end things?\", I was a bit shocked when he asked that and I replied that if there is major incompatibility we shouldn't continue, but if there are things that can be worked around we should. When I asked him the question back -if he wanted to end things, he said \"he doesn't know\" leaving me feeling terrible.\n\nWhile we were exchanging grievances, I mentioned how I want emotional connection and it's lacking from him, he has told me a few times now how he isn't an emotional person, I think I didn't translate this as \"emotionally unavailable\". I also told him I am at a point where I want a relationship to go towards marriage but obviously with the right guy and I don't want to settle. Idk if the word marriage freaked him out. On the same note he replied he doesn't have such pressure  (which btw I already clarified before I even started this relationship, he was also looking for a LTR). After all this he said let's think about this and meet over the weekend, he hugged me tightly and asked if he could kiss me; I was just very confused about how much stuff happened in such a short span of time. I had one of those lame ass kiss and he left. He also made a comment about how next week we might grow stronger after giving enough thought. I wasn't expecting this at all on the day I came back after being apart for 2 months.\n\nToday, we met for lunch and he told me how he doesn't see us being a long term thing and he doesn't want to string me along. He told me he doesn't see us together in a few years and I wonder if this had something to do with me bringing the \"marriage\" topic. I thanked him for being honest, he suggested we be friends and I said no. I was hurt sitting there feeling a void in my heart. I did like him a lot! Tbh I went with the mindset that let's do some exercise together to see if we speak different love languages and that might help understand each other a bit and was going to work on this.\n\nAs I reflect - He is emotionally unavailable, which drove me crazy, I was extremely drained chasing him for attention and I like emotional support. In the long run he would have left me feeling very lonely in the relationship. He wouldn't put any effort into planning our dates, which he admitted today is a flaw in his personality as he just \"goes with the flow\", this was when I clarified how I have picked most of our date activities while he hasn't done much, this was a response to his comment on how he enjoys time more with his friends than me. He wouldn't text me for days and I was left very disconnected with him, when we met it was all nice, but when we were away he was very distant. I felt a lot of the time I was carrying the relationship and it was overwhelming. Emotionally I felt I could never get past the superficial level - he enjoyed discussing dnd strategies, game theory , psychology and other stuff more than his feelings. \n\nYou might wonder why I stuck around - when I asked him if he had feelings for me, he said yes. He has never once cancelled a date he agreed to meet, he has always shown up. He told me how he never spends time with people he doesn't like and the fact that he is showing up says he likes me. He is a decent guy, very respectful, more of a gentleman and we connected a lot intellectually and we are kinda nerds. I thought of ending it with him multiple times and I kept giving him time since he was actually a nice guy and was hoping things will change. Idk if I would have felt better if I had actually gone with breaking it off with him due to his poor communication and low effort. I spoke to multiple people and they all just told me to give it some time and not to rush into breaking it off with him since he is an otherwise nice guy.\n\nI absolutely have no intentions of reconnecting with him. When he suggested we stay friends, I rejected that idea saying that's not how I function. I need to continue working on my relationship goals and I don't want to be \"friends\".I told him I need to take care of myself and my wants. I think people should just stop using that term.\n\nIdk what's the whole point of this post, but I am just floating in a myriad of emotions and very hurt and sad. This is both our first LTR, if it matters. My anxious nature and his distant self really didn't do a good job, I was working on regulating my emotions but to be honest I wasn't asking more from him. I wasn't needy or clingy, I gave him enough time apart. I just don't know how this all came to and end so quickly. I also don't know what I could have done better or if he is just a wrong match for me.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1675564985.0},{"title":"Daily sticky thread for rants, raves, celebrations, advice and more!

Does it hurt? Yes. Is it for the best? Absolutely. \n\nHis Hinge profile said he wants a life partner. In a prompt he said he\u2019s looking for someone who actually wants a relationship, not just a fling. At three weeks when we had sex, he agreed to be exclusive\u2026 all good signs, right?\n\nHe was always a bad texter, but we talked about it and I believed it was just his personality. I never questioned his interest in me because he was great in person and on the phone. We dated for six weeks, and I felt pretty secure for most of it, until this week he was too busy to make plans. \n\nI communicated my needs: I\u2019m okay with not texting a lot as long as we see each other at least once a week and have occasional calls.\n\nHe communicated his own: he listed a few projects that have him busy, said he doesn\u2019t have much free time, but he\u2019ll \u201ctry his best.\u201d \n\nI pressed a little: if you want to see someone, you make time. Plan a day off together, or even just an evening. I\u2019m busy too, but we can make it work. \n\nHe responded by saying he \u201cprefers to go with the flow\u201d and just \u201chang out\u201d whenever it works out; he knows that\u2019s not good for a relationship, but that\u2019s how he\u2019s lived for 15 years and \u201cthat\u2019s all he can offer right now.\u201d \n\nHe also made a comment about it being too fast, which might be fair. I wasn\u2019t demanding a relationship though, I just wanted to be intentional about making time for each other. In my opinion, if you\u2019re both looking for a life partner, asking to see each other once a week and maintain communication in between isn\u2019t too much to ask. I can\u2019t build an emotional connection or any momentum toward a relationship with less than that. \n\nMaybe he can, or maybe he\u2019s a 40 year old bachelor because he\u2019s avoidant and\/or afraid of commitment. Either way, it doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that I discovered our needs are not compatible, and instead of agreeing to just \u201cgo with the flow\u201d to keep him in my life, I recognized it, wished him the best, and moved on.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1675457854.0},{"title":"Daily sticky thread for rants, raves, celebrations, advice and more!

I\u2019m mid 30s he\u2019s late 30s. After 3 dates he decided he just wanted to be friends. I didn\u2019t think he was being serious and was like, sure. He started inviting me places, we have dinner together regularly, I\u2019ve met his friends. We have not slept together though he has tried. The thing is he gives me very mixed signals. Like every once in awhile he\u2019ll just kiss me and we hold hands. Back in the fall he texted me he loved me when he was drunk. The next day he acted like nothing happened and he disappeared for a month\u2026I also didn\u2019t reach out to him. We ended up reconnecting and we never mentioned the text. He took me out to dinner (he always pays) and we were browsing this store and he bought me a dress I really liked. He ended up asking me for advice about asking out some girl he liked and it kind of crushed me. These feelings took me by surprise because I thought I accepted we were just friends. Now knowing that I do have feelings for him I\u2019m wondering if I should just suppress them or end things? It sucks to see him dating other people. Also, I asked him in the summer why he wasn\u2019t interested in dating and he couldn\u2019t really give me ab answer. If we get along so well and he\u2019s attracted to me I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s not interested :(\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you all for your responses. It seems most are suggesting end it.

I've had some amazing relationships and more casual experiences through apps over the last decade. The first year of the pandemic ground my dating life to a halt, but ever since getting back onto the apps, I've noticed something that's also been noticed by my friends who use dating apps: one-sided conversations with matches are extremely common.\n\nIt feels like *at least* every other exchange I've had with a match on online dating has been one of those weird situations where you instigate the chat and it becomes very clear that you are going to be the one carrying the whole conversation. You ask a thoughtful, open-ended question, you get a one sentence statement as a response. Rinse, repeat. My standard approach to messaging in the past has been to have 1-2 exchanges before suggesting a date, if the energy feels right. But these days, those first 1-2 exchanges are often so lethargic and one-sided in effort that I don't even bother bringing up the idea of meeting up for a date. This has always happened on apps, but I feel like it wasn't nearly as constant 3-4 years ago.\n\nThis is an oft-discussed problem with dating apps and I've seen some people chalk this up to the ratio of genders on dating apps. But from an experiential perspective, I don't buy that. Because like I said earlier, my friends who use dating apps (a wide spectrum of genders) are constantly bemoaning the same issue when we compare our dating lives. Is there some kind of mass burnout with dating apps, where people want to find other options but can't? So they stay on the apps and invest as little energy as possible? I don't know what to think of this and am open to any theories.\n\nUPDATE: Well, this blew up! One thing that I just wanted to add is that I\u2019m glad to see a bunch of people arguing that asking someone out after a few exchanges is too soon. I used to go for more exchanges before popping the question because that felt more natural to me, but a key part of why I\u2019ve shortened it down to a few exchanges is from reading threads on here and hearing from a few folks IRL about having anemic energy for dating app conversations and preferring to get right to the crux. Exchanging more messages still seems like the ideal thing to do, IMO, but it also seems like the general energy for that is declining.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1675309854.0},{"title":"Got dumped after saying I love you","author":"deadmeadows","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/10qy7a9\/got_dumped_after_saying_i_love_you\/","text":"I was dating someone for 5 months, he gave me house keys at Christmas, we spent entire weekends together, we met each others families after one month. He treated me so well and kindly, I fell head over heels.  He was everything I wanted in a partner. \n\nOne night, I told him I loved him while laying in bed. He hugged me really tight and told me he loved me too. I noticed he never said it first but would always say it back. \n\nFast forward a couple weeks, he is showing me something on his phone and he gets a text from a woman he was dating before me but they didn\u2019t work out due to 2 hours distance. Which lead to a conversation about how they never stopped talking, so I was upset. I asked him to re-assure me with saying some nice things. \n\nHe didn\u2019t say I love you, so I brought it up, and said you didn\u2019t say you loved me. He just sat in silence for 5 min, so I get up and say, if you don\u2019t love me now, you probably never will. And that\u2019s where I messed everything up.

I\u2019m just not sure how to be sexually appealing to women looking for something casual as a relatively normal, nerdy guy (both in my OLD profiles and on the initial dates). \n\nI know how be attractive in the \u201csweet, dependable partner\u201d kind of way, but not so much in the \u201cexciting, sexy casual partner\u201d way. The few women I\u2019ve dated mostly compliment me on my kindness, which is fine but I feel like that isn\u2019t going to attract people with more casual intentions.

I\u2019m smart, I workout regularly, and I wear clothes that fit and style my hair, but despite that I haven\u2019t had much success. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m completely lacking in confidence, but I can be awkward at times and I don\u2019t radiate confidence. I\u2019m also not a dominant personality (in the non-BDSM sense), in that while I\u2019m not passive I\u2019m also not comfortable being in the lead 100% of the time inside and outside the bedrooms. I prefer more 50\/50 dynamics. \n\nI find what women find sexy in normal men to be baffling at times. All I need to be interested in casual sex is someone who is decently physically attractive (but in my league), nice, attracted to me, and who I have enough in common with that we can have good conversation for an hour or two. And I can offer all that myself! But it seems like women have far higher and different standards. \n\nI also struggle with how to write a profile that is appealing for something casual. There\u2019s no male equivalent to bikini or butt pics, and so I\u2019m left with pictures and a profile that are basically the same ones I\u2019d use when looking for something serious.  \n\nSo, how can a normal, nerdy guy like me be sexier to women? What am I missing?\n\nEdit: To be clear, I think I\u2019m pretty decent looking, I\u2019m just not ripped\/super toned. But I do workout often and have a full head of hair etc.\n\nEdit 2: Also, I\u2019m talking about causal dating in general, not just ONS\/hookups.","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1675272898.0},{"title":"Great First Date, But Then Like...

I do plan on going to Europe to spend some time with him. A part of me is interested in seeing where this could go but another part realises that long-distance relationships, relocating for love, etc etc is very hard.

I really saw potential in us. Two weeks ago I said I can only move forward with this if he puts in more effort, especially with communication, and he agreed, but then made no change. I told him it\u2019s okay if he wants to take it slow, but at the end of the day all he was doing was breadcrumbing and leaving the door slightly open so he could come back when it\u2019s convenient for him rather than taking the out. \n\nEdited section: His ex and I ending up getting in contact with one another.\n\n\nTLDR.\n\nHe\u2019s a serial cheater.

I knew he was between apartments and that\u2019s how we connected via OLD because he was staying with his family and I lived nearby. Clearly did not share with me he was kicked out by his ex. Their relationship ended much more recently than he led on and had I realized that and the seriousness of it, I would have known he was not ready for a relationship even though his dating profile had \u201clooking for a relationship.\u201d\n\nDuring the entire length of the time we were involved he was trying to win his ex back by sending her flowers and letters, seeing me, but also heavily active on the apps trying to meet up with even more women. He pulled away from me when he moved back to where he was living before (about 50 min from me). Prior to him pulling away we spoke often of the dates we would go on once he was back there because it\u2019s more of a city.\n\nHe\u2019s insatiable.

I suppose I feel lucky to have only wasted ~3 months of my life due to him, but it caused all these insecurities and anxious feelings to come up and I\u2019m having a hard time shaking the experience.

It\u2019s a very mature outlook and he told me that he hasn\u2019t been able to connect well with girls his age, or even friends, since they\u2019re mostly interested in partying and not focused on building their lives.

Much of the working age job market is seasonal\/retail\/hospitality, so a lot of folks move away and the demographics are quite skewed toward retirees.\n\nI\u2019m here because of my job, which initially was out of my control but then I met my ex via Tinder and we were together for 8 years which included getting married. I\u2019m on a program for my career that locks me into this location for at least a couple more years because my ex needed to stay local for his kid from a previous relationship. The ex and I have been separated for over a year and the divorce is in progress, and I\u2019m looking to dip my toe into the dating pool\u2026\n\nI\u2019m hoping to attract someone with a stable job, ideally in a professional field and hopefully with some understanding of a pressured work environment\/demanding career. I\u2019m attracted to a wide range of appearances and don\u2019t mind someone follicularly challenged or heavier built.\n\nMy dealbreakers are smoking, kids & right wing politics\/antivaxxers.\n\nI have come across some profiles that catch my eye in terms of my preferences, but they are all incredibly outdoorsy. It does seem to be the main reason people actively choose to live here. Got as far as a second date with one and it was clear he was really looking for someone as intensely active as he was.\n\nI feel a bit of a black sheep in that I\u2019m not very \u2018Type A\u2019 personality in the other realms of my life - e.g., I know I don\u2019t have a particularly feminine appearance and I could enhance that with more make-up & styling but day-to-day with work it feels there isn\u2019t much point and I don\u2019t enjoy the time\/effort it takes. My exercise capacity is slightly limited by a longterm health condition and I\u2019m pretty picky about the sports\/types of exercise I enjoy due to how injury prone this condition makes me but if I can go at my own pace and guided by my body, I enjoy some sports immensely (snowboarding, skiing, swimming & cycling in particular). My body size\/shape reflects that I don\u2019t exercise regularly but good food\/eating out\/cooking are things I enjoy. Also it seems mandatory here to REALLY love dogs and I just don\u2019t. \n\nAll photos are from within the last year except the 2 snowboarding ones (first & fourth). Between Covid and my ex\u2019s introversion\/narrow interests, I haven\u2019t done a whole lot except work in the last couple of years so my choice of recent photos is limited and not particularly representative, if that makes sense. Most of my friends either work conflicting schedules, have kids, or live far away.\n\nI am leaning towards not having kids myself but it\u2019s up for discussion. I\u2019m aware time is not on my side which is one of the reasons I\u2019m not simply seeking something casual until I can move away - but I would stay for the right person and there are advantages and things to love about the area. With company, I could definitely see myself getting into hobbies which make the most of the natural environment here.\n\nI think I am probably looking for mythical creature who\u2019ll meet my criteria and accept me at face value, and\/or have a mismatch of standards in a geographical area that\u2019s already thin on the ground in terms of singles, but comments and tips gratefully considered!

But he didn\u2019t.  \n\nI wasn\u2019t sure how I felt because I\u2019m not in the mood to date and he and I do seem to have different energies.  He has a more serious and muted energy and I would say mine is unselfconscious and expressive.  I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m \u201cfunny\u201d but I\u2019m usually amusing and humorous and I find a lot of things funny and I laugh easily.  I guess I feel more connection to people who are funny or who seem to enjoy me and with this guy neither seems to be the case.\n\nBut he\u2019s nice enough and not bad looking, seems to have good morals.  So I guess I feel lukewarm and I was okay if he wasn\u2019t very interested.  His communication really slowed down after we met and I figured that was that but then he asked me out again and had a thoughtful date suggestion (paint bar) \n\nWe met tonight and he bought the paint bar tickets but I bought his food and drink and we had a decent time.  He walked me to my car but he was lingering and I didn\u2019t know why so I just kept talking bc I didn\u2019t know what else to do.  So I talked and talked for 30 min.  I told him I need to be interrupted, because my mouth doesn\u2019t have breaks.  Especially not when I\u2019m nervous.  If we were having dinner I would be able to focus on talking less and drawing him out more but since I didn\u2019t know why we kept standing next to my car, I just rambled.  Again at the very end it seemed like he was trying to figure out how to kiss me but we only hugged.\n\nWhen I got home he messaged right away but we still only use messenger and he never asked for my number.\n\nI can\u2019t figure out if we like each other or not.

I poured over every word, trying to figure out where it all went wrong. What did she mean by \"incompatible\" and \"different lifestyles?\" What does \"not what I'm looking for\" translate to?\n\nAnd then I put my phone down. And a few minutes later I was reading the text again, like it was the Rosetta stone leading to my understanding of dating happiness. \n\nSomewhere around my fifth pass through her text I realized I was wasting my time for two reasons:\n\n1. Even if I understood exactly what she meant I wasn't going to be working on convincing her she was wrong. We dated for a short time, she was done, I was moving on. If she had put some actionable objective feedback in there (I don't shower often enough, my apartment is ugly, etc) I might be able to improve but otherwise these were situation specific items.\n\n2. She might not have meant a single word she said anyway.\n\nWe all say stuff when we break up. Sometimes it's platitudes to spare the other person's feelings (really to make us feel better about breaking up with them) and sometimes it's just stuff you say. Goodness knows I've broken up with a woman who I wasn't physically attracted to and gave every reason but that one \n\nI remember breaking up with one woman who was mentally picking out our wedding invitations and she lobs out, \"we're in very different places in our lives\" despite the fact she would have sworn to opposite five minutes earlier. She just needed to say something to make herself feel like the breakup was her idea too.\n\nWe all want to think we're in control of our lives and the other person isn't leading the charge. We have a wide slew of ego defense mechanisms, one of which is lobbing out nonsense phrases during a breakup like \"different lifestyles.\"\n\nAnyone here ever heard or said something incredibly stupid during a breakup just because someone just needed a reason?","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1674970968.0},{"title":"Great guy, but worried about being attracted","author":"Nice-Ad6510","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/10o7p20\/great_guy_but_worried_about_being_attracted\/","text":"I recently met a wonderful man online.

We exchanged contacts, parted ways, and he asked me for drinks later the same night. Then we went on a scheduled date later in the week. We had a good time together, but I\u2019m having difficulty reading him and getting a sense of who he is under the surface. In general, he comes off either as guarded, or as someone who struggles with making deeper connections. It\u2019s also possible he was micro dosing bc he mentioned it on the date and that could explain why I felt it difficult to connect. \n\nNow the first real red flag is that he has not been in a relationship for 8+ years, and I haven\u2019t been able to figure out *why* he hasn\u2019t been in a relationship for so long. He\u2019s not on the apps, but surely he could have had something happen organically? When I asked, he didn\u2019t say much more than it just hasn\u2019t happened for him. \n\nThe second issue, he\u2019s not a great kisser and he doesn\u2019t come off as very passionate or experienced. In my personal history, I have never\/rarely had a positive sexual encounter with someone who wasn\u2019t a good kisser (\u201cgood\u201d is obviously subjective). \n\nSo I\u2019m struggling with what to do here. I\u2019m not seeing serious-relationship-potential, and if we move into a casual relationship, I doubt it would be sexually satisfying. But I also don\u2019t want to burn a bridge professionally, and he\u2019s a nice guy and don\u2019t want to hurt him. He also told me on the date that he was asked to become an organizer for the networking community we met at, which adds a small layer of complication bc I am also active in the community (1-2 times a month).\n\nEssentially looking for advice on how to break things off in a way that we can maintain a positive professional relationship, or advice on if I should keep seeing him until I figure some of this stuff out.\n\nETA: This guy had one relationship, totaling 2 years, starting in high school and ended when he was 19. \nHe has not been in any relationship since then. *He has never had an adult relationship.* \n\nIn this particular sub, *dating over 30*, I would not have anticipated how many people think this isn\u2019t a problem for a woman who has been in multiple serious relationships.

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for, maybe advice, maybe sympathy. \n\nI am a 37 F. I'm feeling pretty disappointed and disillusioned with romantic relationships. I'm unsure if this is just a phase I'm going through but I've been feeling this way for a few months and I don't see my attitude changing anytime soon.\n\nSome background : I was in a 7 year relationship that ended early 2020. He treated me fairly well, especially in the beginning. Except one major problem - he never wanted to have sex. Towards the end of our relationship it had been three years. I tried problem solving this-suggesting therapy, talking about this, etc. He did not want to do any kind of therapy. Eventually it came out that he was more attracted to specific friends of his that he had worked with 10 years younger. I decided to end that relationship upon learning that. Also I wasn't ready to commit to a life of celibacy. I do think he's actually either very low-libido or ace, based on some things he told me about his past, but he would never admit this. \n\nHe wasnt too bad as far as doing chores around the house but I had to basically be the manager - which I found annoying. He wouldn't do anything unless I asked. Occasionally he'd blow up at me if I asked him to clean something, but generally he would do his part in cleaning our home. \n\nHe now is married. When we were dating he talked about how I was the love of his life and marriage was just a piece of paper to him. I was fine with that, and looking back, I'm glad we didn't get married. I hate that I even care about this but it does annoy me because it makes me wonder if he was even being honest about that. Also he proposed rather quickly to his new wife (who is noticeably not physically attractive) , they \"fell in love\" very quickly. That also makes me wonder if his \"falling in love with me\" was just him desperately trying not to be single. I question all of that time spent and if it was even real and genuine. 7 years was a huge chunk of my life. \n\nAfter that relationship I had an insanely high sex drive, after being celibate for so long. I even had some guys I was only seeing for sex - wasn't ready for a relationship. \n\nAfter about 8 months I met a new guy through a mutual sport we both play. He was very good looking, and he seemed shy, which I thought was cute. I pursued him, and we ended up dating for about 2.5 years, off and on. For the first year and a half, I was absolutely crazy about him. I loved him so much, I put in so much effort for him. He was not affectionate and not really giving me what I needed. I tried to talk about love languages, make sure I was meeting all of his needs, I tried to do little things for him that showed how much I cared. None of this changed his behavior towards me. He  would never tell me he loved me, he wasn't physically affectionate. And whenever I'd bring anything up (I tried to be as gentle as possible), he'd get really defensive and deflect onto me. Also, he very rarely initiated sex, and turned me down pretty often, which was really hard on my self esteem, coming out of another deadbedroom relationship already. I started to be convinced that I wasn't loveable. Our relationship ended up becoming a toxic trauma bonding mess. We broke up and got back together about 15 times. He was verbally abusive, would never take accountability for anything, and constantly gaslighting me (I. E. I'd apologize for something and he would keep saying I hadn't apologized). He didn't have his shit together, he was behind on his bills but hid it from me, his house was a mess. He came to live with me during part of our relationship but he would make messes and not clean them up and also wouldn't help Contribute to keeping a clean house. I loaned him 8k to get a car because his car broke down and I was sick of him trying to borrow mine constantly. He said he would pay back within 2-3 months. Well, obviously that didn't happen. I decided to break the cycle and end our relationship in late November. I blocked him on everything so that we don't contact each other. \n\nTowards the end of our relationship I basically lost my sex drive. I rarely orgasmed with him the few times we had sex because he lasted about one minute and didn't make any effort. Unfortunately I still don't have a sex drive and it worries me. I feel like I'm just giving up on sex. And relationships. I'm not convinced that they are actually worth it. Seems like a lot of hassle and not necessarily a lot of benefit. \n\nAlso I like to have a pretty tidy house and after living with a few guys I find it draining having to have lots of discussions about how they're not doing their part (No, I don't phrase it that way) which turns into fights. It's easier just to live by myself and not have to deal with someone else's mess. I'm worried that I will never be able to find someone who I can live with and I feel like they're contributing their fair share. \n\nI have been on OLD, I went on a couple of dates here and there. But I generally don't feel sparks from OLD. We have nice conversations but Im not really drawn to them and nothing ties us together-95% fizzle out. And most of the guys on OLD that message me are not at all my type or have giant red flags in their profiles. \n\nAnyway, it just makes me sad because I feel honestly jaded and I don't want to feel this way. I don't have much desire to date and I feel very cynical about relationships and marriages. I have no desire to have sex either. I feel lost. I just feel like giving up on relationships and accepting a single life forever, even though that's not at all how I imagined my life an did really like to be in a loving and fulfilling relationship. Just seems out of reach.

The last one was totally in agreement. Finally, we are ready we have sex and it\u2019s mutually awesome. \n\nThen, like clockwork, after about 3 times, I get a message about how they don\u2019t know what they want but they would like us to stay friends. They don\u2019t want to hurt me blah blah. \n\nThe most recent time was very hurtful because, for all intents and purposes, we were really compatible (they said so). The person was flirting with me over text. We had to see each other less in person because of distance, their work, and my limitations on driving. Still, conversation was good and had been sexually oriented. \n\nThen I get the speech about why we can\u2019t continue sleeping together and acting on those feelings. The most recent time it was within an hour of the flirty conversation. I called them out and they apologized.\n\nRegardless of how polite they are, i\u2019m getting really tired of this trend.

We went on a couple of dates and had a few sleepovers. \nShe is a mom of 2 and has a pretty busy lifestyle. She is the first woman I have connected with over many years. \n\nThen at the begging of Dec, the communication faded a little and we couldn't schedule things for some time(mostly just her insanely busy schedule, or maybe she just wasn't prioritising our meetups as I was). So I acted on emotion and ended things over a message. It was a mature conversation and we went on with our lives. \n\nI had a month to think clearly about the situation and reached out to her. She responded positively. Since then we have met another 3 times. This time she wanted to wait with having sex, which I liked too, gave a sober perspective to the situation. \n\nRight before our last Meetup something happened in my personal life and made me make a massive life change - moving to a different state. \n\nWe met on Monday and ended things on a hot note that implies that next time we meet, we are likely to have sex again. \nNext few days I realised that I shouldn't carry on with it, especially getting intimate. \n\nWe had a public holiday here on Thursday, so on Wednesday I was trying to setup a meet to end things in person. But then she got sick? And then disappeared mid convo? I had a really weird feeling about the situation, but I feel like she just decided to not deal with me for those few day offs that she had.

What\u2019s more, they claim that a common pattern for guys (at least) is to get into a relationship, get really excited about it, then start to worry that perhaps they\u2019re missing out on something better and bail to go look for it \u2014 and that the only way to defeat this pattern is to go through it a couple of times so you don\u2019t feel that pull away from the relationship.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t seem exactly wrong to me \u2014 after all, I can see how more experience could help a person know what they want and avoid maladaptive dating patterns.

He\u2019s said he intends being serious with me\/our relationship.\n\nFor me, I was infatuated for a while but that\u2019s been uplifted and the last time I saw him I felt a surge of real and genuine feelings. I think I\u2019ve fallen for him. Hard to admit, because I have never (truly) loved another. I have a weird relationship history and I\u2019m divorced and no I didn\u2019t love my ex husband and yes it\u2019s too long and complicated of a story.\n\nI feel so strongly for him.

Is this love or what?\n\nFor context, I\u2019m feeling very secure in this relationship and we text daily as schedules allow and we try to see each other twice a week if not once a week. He offers to FaceTime if it\u2019s been a while and he always tries to see me when he can (so do I). He\u2019ll sometimes give me a phone call too. We laugh together, we have inside jokes, we don\u2019t fight or bicker or argue, we bond over shared hobbies, we are sexually attracted to each other and the sex is great, we are kind to one another, we do cute things for each other, and he gives me the cutest look sometimes when we cuddle that makes me blush.

I'm going on a trip with him from the 11th-28th of Feb. We're both looking forward to that trip and I'm giving myself time to sort through my thoughts until then. Also digging into it more with my therapist who has so far encouraged me to follow his actions more than his words because words mean nothing. Will update as things progress. I'm super appreciative of the very direct feedback \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\n\nI (29F) have been seeing this guy (33M) for about 5 months. We live a few hours apart but things have been pretty amazing since we met. Honestly one of the most intense and immediate sparks that has carried on for a while. We communicate a fair amount daily, video call often, when we see each other it's wonderful and explosive. We've discussed not being exclusive but it feels like things have been growing in a direction I'm happy with and I really think I'm falling hard for him.\n\nWe're both demisexual. Which really deepens the intensity of the connection both emotionally and sexually.\n\nPersonally, I've tried multi-dating and kinda had a hard time with it. As our closeness has grown, I find myself just not finding interest in other men. Feels like a waste of time. The bar is set so high, it feels almost impossible for anyone to meet it.\n\nHe says us not being exclusive and him not feeling the pressure of a relationship has helped him 'show up' better for me as a partner. We had a convo last night where he told me he's still been going on dates but the bar is set super high for him and he hasn't met anyone who comes even close. I also kinda knew this already bec there really is something special here that I don't think one just finds easily. But he says having to be 'tied down' or in a relationship where one is forced to commit makes it harder for him. He's been enjoying being able to focus on us because he wants to.\n\nI'm conflicted because.. well.. the idea of this makes me uncomfortable but at the same time I'm getting the things I want. We talk all the time, we're super attracted to each other and this is the most sexually and intellectually fulfilling relationship I've had. He's really shown up for me recently during some rough times and I've been really happy. So why would I want it to change?\n\nThere's definitely an aspect of sexual exclusivity that I think I want. Because being demi makes it hard for me to separate sex from feelings and I don't know that I am ready for that. But in the long term I want something 'monogamish' where both partners are open to the fact that humans feel attracted to other humans and it would be good to be able to explore that at some point (but I mean way later down the road).\n\nI also never want kids. No rush nor particular desire to get married. So I'm not sure why I should take issue with this if I'm getting what I want. I feel pretty secure in how good of a partner\/catch I am that I'm not threatened by his dates.\n\nConfused about whether this experiment is worth it or if it's reasonable for me to request something like sexual exclusively alone.

I was really flattered and excited even that I am not super attracted to him but I also do not know him at all and we have many things in common- he makes music that I really like, I enjoy the scene, I also make events and I make some noise music some times. \n\nI know that I would be really happy to be with someone who share this passion, because it often means doing things that most 30+ year olds will not accept or understand (late nights, loud music, noise etc.) And it is not easy to find someone especially in a small town like this.\n\nSo he came to me while I was on the dancefloor and barely even danced with me (that is not the place for talking - you either dance with me or if you reeaallly want to talk then okay we can go but everyone who understands the music also understands that dancing first is a much better chance to make a connection). He did not seem fully into that and was hanging around like 1 m behind me which I found super weird as I could not even see him and then after a while he just dissapeared. Fast forward couple hours later when he came and sat next to me, said he is leaving now. I said ohh okay good bye then (I was nice and smiling not being rude but also reserved as I was a bit high and also enjoying the music more than talking). And before he left he said: \"ok I just wanted to tell you that I like you, too!\"\n\nTo which I just did not know how to respond at all I was just really surprised and I could not even think of anything that I did that would make him think I like him as I had not met him at all for 6 years or something.

I have liked his music though and I liked his post on facebook recently and added to an underground music facebook group haha (like few weeks before he wrote to me). \n\nNext morning he wrote to me again to ask when did I get home and apologized for not talking to me again and then after few more messages he said - see you next time! \nTo which I just did not reply at all as I really could not understand what he is trying to do here.\n\nAnyway- the comment of liking me, too and the whole interaction really made me feel like he does not like me that much but for some reason thought that I do so he decided to give ME a chance to go for him. Like why didn't he dance with me or did not ask me out or somehing if he likes me and feels bad that he did not talk to me? Am I too early to disregard his attempts of communication and is this how shy men try to 'play it cool'?

We've been officially together for 9 months (but prior to that, was in semi-dating status since Feb 2021). We live 1.5 miles to each other (close, but takes 30 mins walking). Weekdays we usually see each other 0-2 times, depending on his (very busy) schedule. I work 9-5 weekdays and leave work at work. He also works weekends. It's been like this since the new year and it will be this way the rest of the semester (until March).\n\nMy problem is: he usually has no idea how much free time he actually has for a particular weekend until the last minute. This means I can't really plan my weekends easily. This week he wasn't free to see me at all (today is Friday, we last saw each other briefly last Saturday). Today he told me that this weekend he has to work 'some'. From past experience, I know this can mean anything from only being able to have a quick dinner on Sat\/Sun (worst case scenario), to being able to spend only half of Sat\/Sun together (best case scenario).\n\nBecause of this, I've decided to plan my weekends as if he won't be free. But the problem is, that means I am guaranteed not to see him even more than if I had just waited around until he calls me to say \"I'm free now for the next 5 hours, want to meet up?\". I've done that (waited around) and it just made me feel like a doormat\/like things are unfair. Out of semester time, he is still busier than most people but spend about 3 weekday evenings with me and most weekends (although he also travels a lot, out of semester).\n\nI don't want to pressure him to somehow do something (I don't think it's fair since his job is important), but I also feel like if we don't spend time together I am starting to feel disconnected, and yet if I don't just live my life and plan independent of his schedule, I would build resentment.

With my co-dependent nature it could have gone a different way, but I guess I did learn something in therapy and in life, because when he confessed his doubts I instantly felt all safety that I had with him evaporate and I was like Get this dude out of here now. It was touch and go in our second conversation today, if he\u2019d maybe hinted at trying again I might have jumped at that but I know last night I was telling myself like No, you can\u2019t put yourself through the insecurity of being with someone who has doubts, even if he wants to keep trying. So I stuck to it but it hurts like hell. For two months there we really seemed insanely in love, but based on actual compatibilities, values, long long conversations. So now it\u2019s back to my depression that had already been brewing for a few weeks, my regular scheduled winter sadness. \n\n\nI just broke up with my boyfriend of 3 months. Predictable story of separated man thinks he\u2019s ready but oh wait, he isn\u2019t ready. He said he was having doubts, I said well I have to protect myself now, and we went from there, in two conversations yesterday and today. It hurts like hell. But it would have been extremely difficult, his divorce is a mess and he has 3 kids below 10. Still hurts. We said I love you and everything. He said he really thought he could do it, and that he saw a future with me, but as we progressed it just got more difficult and he was always so gloomy and needy. It\u2019ll take a while to get over this one, compatibility was off the charts.\n\n1,5 years separated, but he and his ex-wife were bird-nesting, which means the children stay in the house and the parents are in the house on alternate weeks. And they were disagreeing about a lot of things in their settlement, it was going to be a really heavy divorce and the ex sounded pretty high-conflict. He was always going on about the \u201ctrauma\u201d of being in a pretty controlling relationship, although I do know that was only his side of the story.

It improves my self-confidence and self-esteem. It makes me feel like when I meet a guy, he's getting to know me for *me.* When I meet someone wig-free, people think I'm *alternative.* Or, that I'm sick (cancer). Or that I'm super sexually outgoing (no sir, I do not want to have a threesome), or that I'm just looking for a hookup - when all I've ever looked for is a long-term partner. I've been asked if I'm Buddhist (I'm not) and if I'm Jewish (nope). Baldness seems to attract a certain type of guy to me, and it's certainly *not* the boy-next-door kind of guy I'm looking for.\n\nFriends, how do I navigate this in online dating? Do I go on a few dates with someone until I get to know them, and then tell them I have alopecia and remove my wig? Do I tell them on the first date? Do I mention it in my dating profile?\n\nIt's hard because I normally *don't* wear a wig. But while I'm very confident, being bald destroys my self-confidence in dating because I don't feel attractive. So while I can totally meet a guy wearing a wig, I would have to tell him the instant we start to do anything sexual, and you guys can imagine how much of a sexual shock it is to go from seeing someone with a full head of hair, to them bald.

Roe vs Wade was overturned about a week before I found out, though I really don't know what I would have chosen. Irregardless, that relationship has ended, and I am ready to enter the dating scene again. I'm not getting any younger, after all! And admittedly it would be nice to not go through it alone. I just don't know if there's any point in putting myself out there while I'm still pregnant... should I wait until after the baby is born and recovery is finished? Or would you date a woman who was already pregnant when you met? Any advice or feedback is much appreciated!\n\nFor info, I just started my last trimester (with a boy) if it's relevant, and I have 3 older children from a previous marriage F(15), F(13), and F(5). So I would obviously only be dating someone who was ok with children in the first place.\n\nEdited for clarity: when I say I don't want to go it alone, I mean I want a romantic companion. I am NOT l looking for support for the pregnancy\/ newborn. The fathers are active and get visitation, and the baby will be coparented between our homes (moreso after the newborn stage). Likely, any new partner would not even meet my kids for a while. I would want to take my time getting to know them without kids involved first, and it wouldn't be fair to them or the children to make introductions unless I knew it had potential to go somewhere. I am not looking for a replacement father, but if a relationship worked out they would obviously have to be ok with kids, as that would be an important factor in the future. I am mostly curious if men would consider dating a woman during that pregnancy stage or should I wait until after to start meeting people. I would not make a new relationship partner help take care of my newborn, that would be absurd.\n\nEdit 2: I thoroughly appreciate everyone's honesty! Truly! I think I've been letting the loneliness (and maybe hormones) cloud my judgements, but you guys have certainly brought me back to reality. I think dating is just not feasible right now in my life, and I should definitely wait. I'm sure once the baby is here I'll have plenty of new love and stay plenty busy as well.

I would\u2019ve loved if this \u201cambition\u201d thing came up earlier. It only came up a couple of days ago once I was attached. I don\u2019t know what that says about me, being attached and not seeing things. I\u2019ve been dating the last couple of years and have avoided red flags fairly well. We just got along so well before that and was basically love bombing me without saying it a week or two before all of this. She knew what I did for a living since we first met. I told her what my cap paid and that I could get there fairly quickly, and she said she\u2019d \u201ctotally be okay with that\u201d. Apparently not. \n\nShe claims even if I applied to her job and other jobs that I would show drive and that she\u2019d never resent me to for trying and failing. Maybe after that she would ask how high I can jump? The craziest part is I considered it. That maybe I could get an even better job AND keep her. It just feels so wrong to do that. I know I need to just bow out, call off the Friday night date and just wish her luck. It\u2019s just really hard to consider right now even though I know that\u2019s what I will do.

There\u2019s been five dates. Long story short, things have been great. Plenty of communication and our communication styles seem to match. It seems fast but I was actually invited to a dinner at her parents house and had a good time, she says her folks really liked me. She has one son, a baby. 9 months old. She has been single about 6 months and dad is seemingly from her and her family, really not all that interested in him yet sees him  a little each week. He also lives 2 hours away, since they split he moved in with his parents who love that far away. She says I\u2019m the first person she\u2019s dated since then.\n\nObviously, since I took the dinner, I\u2019m very interested in her. It\u2019s been refreshing to not play games or think they\u2019re being played. That being said, we were talking on the phone Saturday night and I mentioned being interested in dating exclusively and asked how she felt about that. She went on about how comfortable she is with me, that she feels often that we\u2019re the same person. That her family liked me and that I\u2019m so great with her son. She then expressed that her only pause that she\u2019s trying to shake is that she fears that my career drive isn\u2019t the same as hers. She has a better job than I do l, for sure. But I work full time, own my own house and pay all my bills. I\u2019m self sufficient, not to mention when she gets child support, surely it would be significant, since her ex makes 100k a year. It wasn\u2019t mentioned beyond all the nice words and this possible dealbreaker on her end. That obviously wasn\u2019t a yes, which to me, makes it a no. \n\nThat stung quite a bit. I haven\u2019t brought it up the last couple days. She says she hasn\u2019t gone on any dates since our first one. I\u2019d like to believe that, with a toddler and very little help, her free time outside of when we\u2019ve been together, has to be scarce. I saw her Sunday and she suggested plans this Friday night at her place. She\u2019s actually been the one to suggest the next date the last couple of times. Texting and communication is still the same as when before I asked about exclusivity. Almost like it never happened. I\u2019ve been taking a l small step back in things, we have a date this Friday, so there\u2019s that. My texting probably has been a little different, since I think some defensive walls are coming up figuratively for me. It\u2019s hard to put an idea like that that seems harmless and simple and not getting the answer you\u2019d like. Definitely a blow to my confidence with her.\n\nShe texted me after I got off work today, asking \u201cdid I do something?\u201d And that \u201cI seem a bit silent\u201d.

She wanted to get more serious, but due to me being afraid to commit, and basically taking her for granted I turned her down and she quickly met someone else.  I immediately regretted my decision and expressed that regret to her, even before I learned she met the new guy, but it was too late at that point, she was frustrated and determined to move on, or punish me, or whatever.  Over the last 6 months we've had many near misses of reconnecting while she was seeing this other guy.  It was an emotional roller coaster of her getting somewhat close to me, but then ultimately not committing, and me getting angry and saying things I now regret.  We did that cycle multiple times.  I could tell she still loved me, and I wanted to reconnect, but she had feelings for the new guy and reservations about me.  She said on multiple occasions that she loved both me and the other guy.  It was a really unhealthy situation where I think she didn't want to let go of me completely, and I wanted to get back together.  So, she totally enabled the worst emotions in me of jealousy and anger.\n\nNow her and the other guy have split up, but I made the mistake of misjudging where they were at, because she totally kept me in the dark about what was going on between them.  We had been getting somewhat close again, but ultimately I got fed up, angry, and basically told her off and said I wanted nothing to do with her anymore and I was sick and tired of being strung along while she was with someone else.  Horrible timing, this was right around when they split up.\n\nI really love this person and desperately want to give it another chance.  We've talked a limited amount since all the drama, and I expressed that I was just emotional and didn't mean what I said.  She told me that she's hurt and just needs space right now.  I can totally respect that, and give her the space; but the irrational side of me is scared that I'll lose her and I'm dying for some reassurance that we have a second chance out there.  There's a lot of built up resentment we both hold over the messy situation we've been in for the past few months, and I think doubt on her side, some on my side too.  I know I just need to give things space right now and let her come to me, but I just can't stop thinking about her.  I've had a couple short flings with other people during the past few months and both of them I just was thinking about how I wish I was with her.  It's like I can't even date someone else or move on.\n\nBesides just giving it time and seeing whether we can reconnect slowly, does anyone have advice on how to progress here? or what not to do?  I really want to reach out, but I know I need to respect her desire for space, and I don't want to turn her off any more than I already have by getting too emotional.  Is this even worth giving another chance after we've both been so unfair to each other?  \n\nI know that my description of the situation is a lot to unpack, because it's genuinely complicated af.  So I'll be happy to clarify or add any details.","upvote_ratio":0.38,"created_utc":1674005122.0},{"title":"He is not taking me seriously, right?","author":"nwbh","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/10danwl\/he_is_not_taking_me_seriously_right\/","text":"Edit: thanks all for the comments. I teared up a little lol. Dating has been so hard. I wanted to give it up so many times. Anyway I think you\u2019re all right. Thanks for being my sounding board. A bit more context - \n1. When my therapist and I were digging into possible reasons why I haven\u2019t had a single meaningful relationship for the past 4 or so years, she suggested maybe I focus too much on finding red flags than trying to find one good thing about a person. I thought she had a point, because man, I\u2019ve had more than enough first dates (50<n<100), but very few of them were \u2018my type\u2019. I don\u2019t develop feelings easily anyway, and my attempts in \u201ctaking time to get to know someone without being romantic\/intimate\u201d have always failed - either by 1) guys ghosting me first or 2) guys not seeing this developing into something romantic. As long as I have been single, I didn\u2019t have sex for almost 3 years. I have cut off guys before I got intimate. So I guess this time I was trying something totally different from what I would normally do, but you are right that I shouldn\u2019t let myself to be abused. \n\n2. Totally agree with the communication part as well - it definitely is what I\u2019m not good at. I\u2019m not good at speaking my needs, not just in romantic relationships but also in friendships too. I will take this as an opportunity to practice, and talk about how I felt and what I wanted clearly when I cut him off.\n\n3. This is my first time learning the term \u2018neurodivergent\u2019. There actually are so so many guys with some sort of social disorders in my industry - I\u2019ve met countless insecure guys and potentially AS, too, and how careless of me having let this one slide, just because he had many \u201cfriends\u201d. Maybe I should try dating out of my industry.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nF here. While I have had a lot first dates, I haven\u2019t had a serious relationship for a long time (3-4 years). In most cases so far, if I (or a guy) felt like this wasn\u2019t going to work out, I cut things off within 3rd or 4th date. Then my therapist told me, maybe I\u2019m avoidant and should try to be more lenient - and try taking more time than being too judgmental in the early stage.\n\nSo this guy I\u2019ve been dating for about a month now\u2026 We are both in our early 30s and met on OLD. He did not give me a good impression on our first date. We met for coffee, and he didn\u2019t seem interested in me e.g. not making an eye contact, not asking questions about me, only answering to questions I ask, etc. So I totally assumed he was not interested in me at all, and didn\u2019t even wait for a text.\n\nSo I was very surprised when he reached out a couple days later and asked to hang out again. I told him I had other plans, but he waited and asked me out again 2 weeks later. So I was like \u2018I\u2019ll give it a try\u2019, and went for the second date, which turned out to be better than the first date. I still had to ask him a lot of questions because he wouldn\u2019t talk much, but maybe because he was drinking, he was a bit more talkative and I actually had some fun. So we made out a little.\n\nIt\u2019s the third date when I started to feel something was off. We cooked together at his place and got intimate. I was so surprised when, after we had sex, there was no pillow talk. No pillow talk at all - I have dated a fair number of guys and he was the first guy who didn\u2019t have any pillow talk. What\u2019s more, usually after having sex, a guy would suggest taking a shower together, or taking a nap together, etc., but this guy\u2026 after a little while, he got up silently without talking to me, got dressed again, and started hanging out on his own in the living room.\n\nIt was a totally different vibe compared to before having sex. I felt so awkward - like I wasn\u2019t sure what I was supposed to do. Felt like an uninvited guest. But because I had somewhere else to go afterwards, I left his place anyway and he gave me a ride. \n\nI didn\u2019t feel great after the 3rd date. I noticed he didn\u2019t text as much after the 3rd date, and his replies got shorter. I wanted to end things here, but reminded myself of what my therapist told me, and convinced myself that maybe there was not enough evidence to end things already.\n\nThen he asked me out for a 4th date. He does come with plans but he only reaches out at the last minute [removed details]\n\nI found out more red flags about him on the 4th date:\n- He never asks me how my day\/week went. He rarely asks any questions about me (persistent since the 1st date).\n- I ask him questions and his answers are extremely short, and he doesn\u2019t want to elaborate. e.g. Do you like X? \u2018No.\u2019 Why not? \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 I get frustrated, the conversation stops there and, silence. He only occasionally talks\/asks about topics of his interests.\n- He doesn\u2019t remember what I told him before. e.g. I will be away for 4 weeks and he didn\u2019t remember that it was a long trip. And even after he was reminded, simply told me to \u201chave fun\u201d and that was it. He didn\u2019t care.\n- He gets carried away easily and seems to live in his own world. [removed details]\n- When we went to his place again, his behavior was the same - being cuddly until sex, but after sex, doing his own thing without inviting me. When I joined him, he left me again to do something on his own. He didn\u2019t even ask me if I wanted to sleep over. I was going to leave anyway, but felt like I was being kicked out. \n- The fact that he\u2019s making me overthink and write this lengthy post.\n\nI think these are enough red flags that he is not compatible and not taking me seriously. At first, I was making excuses for him that maybe he\u2019s socially awkward or maybe he\u2019s nervous - but he has many friends that he loves who plan trips with all the time. If this is the way he is, don\u2019t want to try to fix him - don\u2019t want to date a broken guy.\n\nI wanted to get your opinions to make sure that, this time I\u2019m not prematurely ending things. What do you think? It seems like I can never find good quality men on OLD.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1673862887.0},{"title":"Profile Review: 35 Male- unsure on order of pictures","author":"AlexinChains87","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/10dfzir\/profile_review_35_male_unsure_on_order_of_pictures\/","text":"I go back and forth between pictures and ideally looking for a serious relationship, last photo is a video prompt \n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/OJgoRvn","upvote_ratio":0.62,"created_utc":1673879522.0},{"title":"Profile Review: 34M - Values or Interests?","author":"HymnHymnIWIN-","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/10d1eqs\/profile_review_34m_values_or_interests\/","text":"I was curious as to how others go about crafting their profile to be more than the pictures that represent them. I believe common values are important to developing a lasting relationship and I tried to convey that message. Things like generosity, courtesy, intelligence, kindness, and overall happiness are important to me in a partner but only discovered through witnessed actions while getting to know someone better. So I focused on the following: financial habits, interpersonal relationships, and environmentalism. I screen for drug use, prospective partners with children, excessive religiosity and extreme political views. These are things I will not compromise on. I think something like 1\/3 of single women my age already have children and I wonder sometimes whether I should compromise on this point. I've been through the ringer with training (recently finished) and I would like to share adventures with a future partner before children enter the mix. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, making a connection with someone new over values is much more difficult than bonding over common interests. It's much easier to foster a new relationship over a shared hobby or musical preferences. I infrequently get matches (Date 0 with someone new every couple months). I figure my profile is may be off putting to some and I screen pretty heavily up front. The people I have met have been great but things didn't work out for one reason or another. My interests include: art and fashion as a form of self expression, reading, hiking, rock climbing, listening to the symphony, playing word games (Boggle, Scrabble, Wordle) and discussing philosophy. I would love to meet someone who likes to play Magic the Gathering (lol). None of the above is a requirement which is why I focused on common values. It's rare to come across a flushed out profile (interests or otherwise).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDOT: What do you think of this approach and how do you personally address this balance in your own profiles?\n\n[Profile 34M](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/xqGvcUU)","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1673832878.0},{"title":"I (35F) love him (40M), but\u2026","author":"thegirlnextpizza","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/10d55bi\/i_35f_love_him_40m_but\/","text":"Painting the picture:   \n\nI\u2019m 35F with no children, my partner is 40M with one 4yo child.\n\nI grew up very poor, no advantages in life, and  worked very hard to reach my current career where I make anywhere between 120-150k incl commission. This is the first job where I have made enough to not live paycheck to paycheck, and for the first time in my life I feel like I can \u201cbreathe\u201d (ie I have no debt, bills are paid on time, credit is good, I have money saved for a rainy day and I\u2019m investing).   \n\nMy partner grew up in a gated community with a silver spoon and has always been taken care of, and I feel this has impacted his overall ambition and drive. \n\nHe has bounced around between jobs making anywhere from $22-$26 per hour. Because this is not enough to match his current expenses, his other supplements his income (he shared with me that he has a \u2018trust fund\u2019 but in fact he just has a mom who e-transfers him anywhere from $1,000 to $5,000 each month as he needs). Last year I believe she gave him roughly 30k \ud83d\ude31.   \n\n\nI am with this man because he has the largest heart I have ever known. He is gentle, kind, compassionate, patient, understand, communicative, thoughtful, romantic and non reactive. If I am the river, he is the rock.   \n\nAfter a few months of dating initially (we\u2019ve been together about 8 months now), I broke up with him. He was working a shitty job that required him to travel for up to a week at a time - often with little notice - and paid him $22 per hour for hours worked on site. This meant every evening spent in shitty hotel rooms was unpaid time that he was sacrificing from his child. His kid never knew when dad would or would not be around and it had a big impact on him. \n\nAs someone who wants a child of my own, this was alarming to me. The cost was too high for such little gain.   \n\nMy partner hated this job and would often complain, but wouldn\u2019t take any action at all. To make matters worse, if it was his week to have his child as part of his 50\/50 custody agreement and he happened to be travelling, his mother (the one supplementing his income) would come stay at his home and care for his child (the child\u2019s mother did not want the extra time with her child - she\u2019s a real gem).  At one point my partner was in a car accident, and was injured enough that he had some time off work. Rather than using any of this time to look for a new opportunity, he wasted the days away playing video games all day.   \n\nWhen he went to replace his vehicle after the accident, he asked to borrow the $1,000 down payment from me. Alarm bells went off that this man was signing for a vehicle that would cost $700 per month (a brand new Acura MDX) yet he did not have $1,000 in the bank.   \n\nI lent him the money, and then broke up with him. 40 years old, no money saved, no drive or ambition to want more, all while having a child to support\u2026 I was out.    \n\n\nHowever\u2026 a few months later we reconnected. He had lost 40lbs on a new strict gym regimen, was taking great care of himself, his son was in a new school and they had been following a new routine at home (it was the wild Wild West when I was around last), he had been regularly seeing a therapist since our breakup, had been journalling and reflecting daily, and he had started a new job that he was loving where there was opportunity for growth - and he had already got a raise!   \n\nI remembered how much I adored this man for all of his wonderful qualities and could see that he had seen tremendous growth which he seemed committed to. I got back together with him.   \n\nFast forward four months and the relationship is going wonderful. We are having the time of our lives together, seemingly communicating well and openly, and I\u2019ve developed a wonderful relationship with his family. \n\nThen, after a long Christmas break of us being lazy and him playing video games all day for a week (no hate, everyone needs to unplug for time to time), he tells me he is jobless. Why? Because just before the Christmas break guys at work were talking (he was doing Reno\u2019s) and apparently the owner of the company had been collecting deposits on jobs to make payroll, but wasn\u2019t finishing projects. Customers were pissed and it was clear (so they say) that their jobs were on the line. So they all jumped ship.   \n\nMy partner started reaching out to the companies he had applied to when securing this job, and met someone for coffee to discuss a job opportunity. He was told they could have work for him in a week. However a week later, after he had already quit his job, they told him they actually can\u2019t take him on until mid February.   \n\nMy issue is this: My partner has been talking to me about getting engaged, moving in together, even about when we would start trying for a baby. Yet, he did all of this with no communication to me whatsoever. He quit his job without even talking to me. If we were already living together, or better yet had already had a baby, and this happened\u2026 I would be financially responsible for myself, a 40 year old man, his child and our baby!  \n\nI do not feel okay about this, and as this all seems to feel very familiar I am reflecting on what has been consistent since we got back together. And really, it\u2019s nothing. He doesn\u2019t go to the gym anymore, he has not seen his therapist since we got back together, his child is running amuck again with no structure, and now he has no job - and still has nothing saved, still carrying his debt, but still driving his brand new Acura.    \n\nI am 36. I\u2019ve worked hard to get to a place where I am ready for the next steps with the right person - ie marriage, engagement, children. I have my shit together and I am financially and otherwise independently. I am terrified that if I partner with this person I will wind up financially responsible for them - just like their mother is Joe. I do not want to fill her shoes.  I want and deserve a partner I can rely on, who can be an equal. This does not have to be to the dollar, but a consistent job and income that they are committed to and responsible with.   \n\nAll of this to ask\u2026 am I just fitting a square peg into a round whole? Am I just driving us both towards a resentment?  On the other hand \u2026 what if I spend the rest of my life searching for all of his wonderful qualities?   \n\nI\u2019m 36, I\u2019m in the last fertile window I have if I want a child of my own, and I am both terrified of wasting time while also terrified of losing a great love.   \n\nHelp!

She's an anxious attachment, depressed. I'm an avoidant attachment and also depressed. \n\nI grew up in a household with emotionally distant parents and siblings. So I've learned to just deal with my emotions instead of leaning on others. I believe this has led to a lot of moments in past romantic relationships where I simply did not know how to support a partner that was struggling with difficult episodes in their lives. They could have had a breakdown and I'd just be clueless about what to do to offer support in that moment. \n\nI'd usually try to support in the way I know how -- spending time with them, doing things for them around the house, trying to distract them from the issue, offering advice. But listening to hard emotions and 'being there' for them has always been tough. For example, sometimes there really wasn't anything that could be done about a shitty situation so I would just console my partner because there's simply nothing to do but accept and move on or try something different.  \n\nIn my current relationship, I'm constantly being called out by my girlfriend for not giving the emotional support she needs. She says that she is there for me in my rough moments. But when she is down or depressed, I don't give her the same kind of support she gives me. On one hand, I find this unfair because I do offer her support but it often seems to be simply not what she needs (as if it's lost in translation). I also always tell her that she can also just pull me aside and tell me what's bothering her. But she often puts her problems after mine and decides for herself that she can't share it if I'm already busy or depressed about something too. \n\nI'm already seeing a therapist to work on my emotional availability but it seems I am always failing to measure up to her standards of what emotional support should look like (e.g. \"I do this for you all the time, why can't you do this for me even just once?\" \n\nThese dramatic arguments often leave me very bitter and frustrated that I don't seem to be able to support her even when I try. I'm close to just giving up on a relationship *again* out of frustration and disappointment over constantly being told that I'm not supporting her, which I read as \"not good enough as a boyfriend\".\n\nI guess I'm writing here as a rant and also to understand : Where am I failing ?

I've been apartment hunting for some time. A major issue that's made it extremely difficult to find something even in the realm of my price range is (in the Bay Area!!!)that doesn't have major issues (such as bug infestations) is having a larger size dog. Most places have weight restrictions. I finally agreed to go a little higher in price and am now finding some units I'm considering, but most are top floor units that don't have elevators. I've been seeing a guy for about a month and half (though he was gone almost 3 weeks for vacation) who uses a wheelchair. I know he can make it up a few steps but I'm not sure if we could do a whole flight of stairs. One of the places I looked at has a bottom floor available, but it's a studio and I think it's way over priced. There's a top floor available for the same price and somehow seems nice and cozier. I'm still not sure whether I want to take either because I think it's overpriced for a studio. \n\nI reached out to the guy I'm seeing via text to see if me living on a second floor unit would be impossible. He lives at home with his parents currently, he's been saving for a home. So us hanging out at his place would be tricky too. \n\nI'm not sure how I feel about getting an apartment based around the needs of someone I've only been seeing less than 2 months, especially when it's been hard enough to find a place I can afford, is clean and safe, and can bring my dog.

Yesterday, he asked for some time to think if this is going to work in the future as we were both starting to settle down in a foreign country and this might end in a long distance thing, which is tough. He also said he cant stand fighting all the time and living together given our differences. After he left, he called and broke things up saying he can\u2019t be a couple but he wants us to remain sweet and be friends. He still wants us to meet and talk just not be in a couple because of the future. I already had a feeling it was heading that direction and it only took him less than a day to think.\n\nI agree this is tough to maintain in the future but I was willing to work things out and give us a try yet, he just wants us to be friends, still calling me darling. We both love each other obviously but him thinking of the future is what\u2019s made him end it.\n\nShould i continue talking to him and allow him to call me babe?\nWould appreciate your thoughts.

He has been subletting my place while I travel (Nov-April). We have been sending long voice notes several times a week, now even talking about trying to both move to the same tropical paradise (with his band mate) later this year. Is this a slow burning crush or am I reading into it?\n\nFull scoop:\n\nWe met 5 months ago when he agreed to sublet my place for winter. He runs a Kirtan group and I have a masala chai business, so we started collaborating on events during my last few months in town. I got to know some of his friends and quickly became part of the crew. I\u2019m now traveling and we exchange voice notes a couple of times a week\u2026 often expressing gratitude for our connection and excited about what we are\/can learn from each other. \n\nWe both ended relationships last July with people we were serious with. I am absolutely over it, he has baggage from relationships in general and is on a intense spiritual path so not overly motivated to find  a new relationship although open to it. \n\nOne of the things we have been talking about is wanting to move away from our current town. Similar vibe but some place warm. \n\nMy issue is I can\u2019t figure out for the life of me if he is crushing on me or not. I get it, we are not in the same place and no guarantees we will be in the future so why would we talk about being together. There is also this fact that he is subletting my space so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for me to broach the subject. He says things like my friends love you, and I love you, so I hope we end up in the same place. Has made comments that it would be cool if I joined the Kirtan group. \n\nI don\u2019t know how any one on Reddit can answer this. But I\u2019m going crazy.

We met a couple of months ago when he had just resigned from his previous job - so he didn\u2019t have a lot of tasks left, just transitioning his work, and was quite free. He was able to text a lot and could meet me 3-4 times a week.\n\nNow that he started with the new company, his workload is back to the normal amount for his job (which is a fuck ton of work). He only has time to meet me once a week and texts only once per day (if that). For what it\u2019s worth, I knew he\u2019d be busier, but I didn\u2019t realize that it was to this extent.\n\nIt may sound shallow and selfish but one of the reasons I liked him was that he was always available and gave me a lot of attention. Now that that\u2019s gone, I feel sad and, shamefully, a little resentful.\n\nNow I have some questions:\n\n1. **Next Steps**: Should I wait this out and see if the situation changes? If I wait it out, how long sounds like a reasonable period of waiting? Should I bring up this need, knowing that he is at a transition point (new coworkers and new environment) and probably can\u2019t give what I want anyway? Or should I just recognize that we have different priorities and schedules and let go of this amazing person?\n\n2. **Am I the problem?** Are my expectations unreasonable? This guy clearly has healthy habits (he takes his rest after a vicious work week, schedules instead of \u201cbooty call\u201d-esque dates, doesn\u2019t text while at work, is attentive and doesn\u2019t focus on his phone while we are together) so maybe the issue is with me?\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to your thoughts and advice!\n\nEdit: Of course, I am working under the assumption that his busy schedule is the reason for decreased contact. He may actually be slow-fading me.\n\n**Editing to answer commonly-asked questions:**\n\nRe: work\n\n- I work, but it\u2019s a remote 40hr\/week tech job that is I enjoy and rarely requires extra hours from me \n\n- his work requires him to be physically away (in another city or, sometimes, country) from Monday to Thursday every week\n\n- he is not allowed (or at least, it is a very bad look) to use his phone during working hours\n\n- this has been his job\/career ever since, he is not new to the job itself, only to the company\n\n- he really likes the work. \u263a\ufe0f\n\n- he has a goal promotion that he\u2019d like to hit this year, he has mentioned this casually on the second date, I think \n\n- he once casually joked: he recognizes that this line of work ends up in divorce so (this part seriously-) he is planning on switching to a different but similar career \u201csoon\u201d (no concrete timeline)\n\n- I knew his line of work was busy, BUT I had no idea they were *this* busy\n\n- I\u2019ve asked about his new work several times (both in person and in text) and the answers are varying details of \u201cstressful but interesting\u201d. He is less detailed in texts, so I try to gauge whether he wants to text about it some more, use open-ended questions, that sort of thing.\n\nRe: slow fading \/ timeline  \n\n- I have tried to wait until he initiates the texts, and when he does, I am able to reply within the hour (almost often within the first 15 minutes). I ask light questions and check in with him. After that I usually get a reply after work hours, or on the morning of the next day\n\n- when he does schedule dates, it\u2019s a couple of days in advance, but if I\u2019m not free (or unable to move my plans around) for that specific day, then it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll meet for that week\n\n- again, I understand that he is prioritizing his work. Anyone would do the same. But if that means dating is pushed out of the top 10 or 5 or whatever list of his priorities, then I think my concerns are warranted.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1673644053.0},{"title":"Do you believe in second chances in dating?

I wanted to give an update on what will hopefully be my last post on this subreddit. I'm married!\n\nFive years ago, I found out my now ex-husband was trying to cheat on me with multiple people just two weeks before my 30th birthday. I entered my 30s feeling lonely as fuck and hella confused. I went on a couple dates in the first year but really started heavily using the apps around age 31.\n\nLike a true nerd, I kept a journal of all my dates. I went out with  14 guys in 2018, 18 guys in 2019, 20 in 2020, and then 23 in 2021 with the 23rd guy being my now new husband. That's 75 people! I'm not going to sugar coat it, it \\*sucked\\* most of the time. You can check out my profile history to see how wound up I would get over mixed signals, ghosting, bad sex, all of it. \n\nIn 2021 I started to lose hope and realized that if I went out on that many dates with guys from the apps, that the apps were not solving my problem. I decided to branch out and try to meet men in other ways. I started flirting in person more and I also started perusing r\/r4r30plus. I eventually saw a guy post from my state who lived 2.5 hours away but seemed cool. We started texting and even had some video chats. About two weeks later we met at a halfway point for our first date and we've been practically inseparable since. \n\nOn our one year anniversary he proposed and we just got married in November. We are currently trying for our first baby, which is something I've dreamed about for years and started to fear wouldn't happen for me.\n\nHe is the most amazing person. He's kind, patient, affectionate, grounded, hard-working, funny, and family-oriented. He's also totally my type physically and I still catch myself on a regular basis thinking, \"wait, am I \\*sure\\* this guy is ALL MINE?!\" \n\nIn hindsight, I cannot believe the shitty behavior I would put up with from my dates in the name of \"realistic expectations.\" I cried over some crusty-ass men who did not deserve my tears at all. GOOD people still exist out there, they're just harder to find. And trust me when I say I am completely average-looking as a woman, maybe even slightly below average-looking, so it's not like I have an upper hand in any way.\n\nI think some things that helped my chances:\n\n1. **I was willing to (and did) move for love.** I work remotely and moved 2.5 hours away to live with my husband. This expanded my dating net widely.\n2. **I gave him a chance when he seemed kinda boring over texts at first.** For example, my man is not well traveled. He went on his first plane ride with me ever last year. In the past, I would have written that off as not adventurous enough. But now I know he's just someone who doesn't like to travel alone and that trait has had an insignificant impact on our relationship.\n3. **I started asking for what I wanted right away.** I used to shy away from the marriage and kids conversation until the 3rd date or so in fear of scaring men off. In my last few months of dating, I started mentioning it immediately. I said hey, this is what I'm looking for. I'm looking for a man who is excited about having a wife and kids someday. And when it scared someone off, good. No more wasted time. When I told my husband that, he was \\*relieved\\* I said it because he wanted that too.\n4. **I looked for guys outside of the apps.** Someone said on this subreddit once that the way to find your partner is to write down what kind of person you're looking for, then start putting yourself in places where that person would be. I knew that my ideal man would be someone who hates the dating apps. And that's when I had the epiphany to stop using them. My husband \\*despises\\* dating apps. He used r\/R4R30Plus and that's it as far as online dating goes. If I would have never looked there, I would have never met him. \n5. **I kept my life open to be rearranged.** I know this gets so harder as we get older and more established in life, but I knew I had to keep myself flexible if I wanted a live-in marriage and kids someday. I was willing to rearrange things in my life in order to combine it with someone's elses. My weekly schedule looks a lot different than it used to be. My husband has cut back on WoW since his group had a rigid multi-day per week schedule. I'm very happy that we've found ways to make a new life together rather than expect each other to work around our current way of life no matter what.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully this is helpful or hopeful to someone out there.

I have a good job and fulfilled by my hobbies and outside interests, but I also am not the kind of person who is traveling more than two trips a year at most, I'm not going on a hike every single weekend, meeting up with friends every week either for drinks or gathering for nights out together in a city an hour away last minute. Occasionally, I go to shows, museums, the movies, out to eat, or small gatherings, but it's not a chronic weekly thing. I'm around a lot of people at my job during the week between meetings and in person, and my hobbies (primarily the gym) put me around a lot of people. Come most weekends, I need to recharge from overstimulation, do errands, and maybe do something socially in the later afternoon\/evening, but I'm also totally fine with staying in with good company, too. What I want to know is that people are great partners even when there's nothing else slated on our plans.\n\nI don't have trouble getting matches on apps, but I find that most people I encounter simply don't have the time or desire to invest in a new connection because they're always on the go, and also not interested in those who are okay with spend their free time unwinding in a more chill fashion. They're always busy traveling, being weekend warriors out there in nature, and their social calendars are overbooked.

They'll always want to see their friends every week for drinks. They'll always be planning monthly trips. They'll always end up in NYC on a whim over the weekend. I know we're not a lifestyle match. \n\nI guess my question is: Does anyone else experience this? Were you able to date or find a partner regardless?

And I'll say upfront that I know this is an anxiety\/me problem, not a relationship problem. It's something I plan on discussing with my therapist.\n\nI started seeing someone I really like (33F) in November. And I mean really, really like \u2013\u00a0the connection I feel with her has been more or less immediate. After a tough breakup last summer and a lot of bland dates, I know this is something I want to pursue and the feeling is clearly mutual: this woman is responsive, I feel she takes me and our relationship seriously, and we've had a conversation about being exclusive.\n\nAs part of getting more serious, I\u2019d like to start introducing this woman to my friends. However, one of my friends (34M) is quite conventionally attractive and confident and also loves to hit on women. He's constantly dating and he's the guy that everyone loves. I'm not proud to admit it, but I'm feeling so hesitant to introduce him to my new girlfriend because I'm feeling...well, insecure and worried about a mutual attraction forming between them, or at least him trying to hit on her. What's weird is that I'm not generally nervous about my girlfriend around other men: she has tons of male friends and I don't feel any anxiety at all about it, nor am I nervous about her meeting other male friends of mine. I'm not sure what it is about this friend specifically that's prompting a lot of anxiety.\n\nI guess I'm looking for a gut read on this situation and \u2013 if you've struggled with this yourself \u2013 advice for navigating it\/managing the anxiety it provokes.

I think the best path forward is to discuss it in therapy and likely to just trust my friend (although if he tries anything, I guess I\u2019ll know). This post has seriously made me question why this friend triggers my anxiety \u2014 it\u2019s actually something I\u2019ve discussed in therapy unrelated to my now girlfriend, so I think there\u2019s a deeper issue here that\u2019s not about my relationship.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1673207552.0},{"title":"Daily sticky thread for rants, raves, celebrations, advice and more!

We haven\u2019t even kissed so I\u2019m not sure he wants anything romantic but my gut says he\u2019s open to it if I make it abundantly clear that I\u2019m interested. I\u2019m not actively dating so I\u2019m just going with the flow and getting to know him platonically first. \n\nChess is one of the things we bonded over the night we met. I play casually online daily but have put next to no energy into studying the game. He mostly plays on a real board at his job between clients appointments. \n\nI challenged him to an online match and won! The next day over text he mentioned food I left at his place and I told him he could have it, joking that it was the least I could do after kicking his butt so hard in the chess game. He responded by telling me he was not impressed and thought I would checkmate him sooner but that he was looking forward to a rematch. \n\nA few days later I challenged him again and again won the game. Over text we confirmed plans to meet tomorrow to watch a TV show and play a physical game of chess. I again joked that I was giving him the benefit of the doubt that he stands a chance against me on a real board and to remind me again how he wasn\u2019t impressed. He again responded that he was not impressed and told me I only won because he made a blunder. He followed up saying that a probably play a lot and am barely intermediate. \n\nI\u2019m making it very clear that my words are playful in tone (with emoji\u2019s and exaggerations and such) but he didn\u2019t make it clear if he was being serious or not. It honestly read as being quite serious. I\u2019m already put off by his words, but want to stay on a playful note without letting him put me down like that in case he\u2019s being serious. \n\nI remind him that I am indeed a casual player who said when we met that I play a lot but almost never study the game and that maybe he should be impressed by my casual skills (of still beating him twice in a row in under 30 turns with ample material still in the board). I half joked that I\u2019m pretty one has to win a game before they can start talking shit to their opponent. Again, I found a way to teeter a line between playful banter and \u201cyour petty put down games aren\u2019t cute so quit it\u201d. \n\nHis response was that he\u2019ll just pay $100 (like I did for the yearly membership) to talk shit to a casual with the eye roll emoji. I have a hard time interpreting that as anything but serious and instantly gave me big ick vibes. I know I\u2019m talking a big game but I took care to phrase it in a friendly way and well\u2026I *did* win both games! \n\nI really didn\u2019t like how he brought up how much I spent on a membership that I haven\u2019t really utilized since I first got it. Or how he is seeming more and more incapable of admitting that I just might be a better player than him, casual or not. I know how silly that sounds but I feel like it could be an indication of how he\u2019d act in similar situations. \n\nThoughts? What would your next move be (pun intended)?

I brought this up as part of a longer conversation of where we saw things headed, and what we wanted from our relationship. throughout this conversation we both communicated to each other that we really liked each other, wanted to date each other exclusively, and wanted to try moving forward with the intent of an LTR. he communicated to me at this time that his inconsistency issues had caused all of his  past relationships to end, but that he wanted to try to work on it. he was not able to articulate exactly how this time would be any different, but that he really wanted to try. i agreed to stick around as long as i saw improvement and that they were trying - i was fully willing to be flexible on timelines as long as i saw effort and an increase in consistency. i wish at the time i had asked what it was about consistency that is so difficult, or what it is that scares him about it (intimacy? rejection? i can now only guess).\n\nthe week after this conversation, his texting behavior went back to \"normal\" - lots of messages throughout the day and i felt he was making an effort to maintain the connection. during the first week after our conversation, he had a stressful work week so we pushed our date off to the next week. the week after that he got sick, and it got pushed again. we finally meet again, and things were great - they are always great in person and i feel very cared about. i start to feel momentum and connection coming back for us, and i assumed this was the start of our weekly dates - when he left he kissed me goodbye and said i'll text you later to pick a day for next week. although we talked throughout the following week, it took him 8 days to reach out to see when i was free the following week. i thought about reaching out earlier myself, but in our last conversation it felt like the ball was very much in his hands to reach out more often and show more effort, so i waited. when he reached out, i told him three days i was available, and got the response \"im thinking probably x day or x day\". the next day he narrows it down slightly and mentions \"right now im thinking x day is best\". the next morning, i said that i needed him to let me know by the end of the day so that i can plan other things - he says he will be out with his friends for NYE but that he absolutely will. he does not. i text him a photo of my outfit for NYE that night, and he doesn't respond. next day, he says nothing about my photo, and just asks how my NYE was. i let him know that im hurt he never confirmed our date when he said he would, and that he left me on read all night and that it made me feel like i wasnt on his mind. this text was the beginning of the end.\n\nthe next two days we go back and forth about how he really cares about me and wants to be with me, and that hes sorry for dropping the ball and being inconsistent. he says that just because he didnt respond to my text or confirm our date night that it doesnt mean he wasnt thinking about me and that it doesnt mean he doesnt want to be with me. he says maybe we should reconsider our relationship if he isnt meeting my expectations. i get immediately frustrated that my communicating my hurt feelings results in him immediately suggesting a breakup as opposed to him trying to repair, but i guess i can't fault him for being self-aware that it's just not working. we go back and forth a bit and ultimately i communicated that i can see he is trying sometimes but ultimately if i can't actually FEEL his feelings for me by him showing me them through actions, that its all in his head. that his words and actions must align for me to feel truly cared for. and that we clearly want and need different things from this relationship. we end up on a soft and caring note, wishing each other well, telling each other that we will miss our time together, and that we dont regret the time we spent together.\n\nnow this is where i'm looking for advice, insight, or stories from others that are similar. for those who have been inconsistent but really did care about your partner and your relationship - what was it about consistency that was difficult for you? was it a fear of intimacy, something else? i know everyone is different but i am really struggling to understand how someone could provide me commitment and intent, but then fail on consistency. i feel like consistency and commitment are often paired, so to get one without the other was hard for me to grapple with. for those who have experienced my side of this in relationship, did it ever get better or do you wish you had gotten out sooner like i did?\n\ni am absolutely heartbroken about this because there was so much potential. there was SO much in our relationship that was so good (didn't really go into detail about it here, but we have tons of overlapping life experience, similar sense of humor, very caring and kind, great sexual compatibility, and a huge spark). but this issue of not seeing each other frequently enough to build momentum was a huge problem for me. i keep going back and forth in my head if there is anything i could have done, but realistically i just wasnt willing to make my needs smaller and become someone i'm not to force this thing to work. but the what if's are killing me. i saw such a great future for us - he was so kind and loving when we were together, and i already miss him so much. i hate that i will theoretically never get to talk to him again, never get a good morning text, never wake up next to him, never get another forehead kiss. ive already started fantasizing about six months down the road maybe he will be different and it will work. i know this is foolish. but im in so much pain.  i cant help but second guess everything.\n\nthanks everyone for listening. <3","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1672880498.0},{"title":"So Happy It's Thursday!","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/103q3uz\/so_happy_its_thursday\/","text":" Got some good news you want to share?","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1672894811.0},{"title":"How do you feel about a match who opens by sharing an incompatibility?","author":"anonymal_me","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/103cqla\/how_do_you_feel_about_a_match_who_opens_by\/","text":"For example \u201cHey you seem great!

Some of you might or might not remember when I asked for advice after getting her number. [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/sscm2a\/comment\/hwyeh9j\/?context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/sscm2a\/comment\/hwyeh9j\/?context=3)\n\n And for several months, I had the best several months in recent memory. She invited me to go out to bars with her friends, who shortly became my friends. We went to Sea World several times, and at times spent the entire day together, and even that didn't feel like enough time for either of us. In May, I told her that I would like to become more than just friends when we both had a stable career, and neither of us had to work 2-3 jobs to live. I figured that if there was going to be any fallout, it would follow shortly. That we weren't dating now didn't matter. She was the type of girl that I wish I met in high school or college. And more importantly, she encouraged me to pursue my dream of going back to college, and supported by choice to try to go back on Social Security (I have Asperger's Syndrome and ADHD, so working 2-3 jobs like her probably wouldn't end well). I figured that even if she wasn't in to me, as long as I was with her group, they'd probably help me find someone to go out with. She had already introduced me to this one girl from Mexico who was over-the-top gorgeous, and she quickly became a good friend of mine as well. If she hadn't moved back down to Mexico, there was a good chance I would have asked her out, and there was a good chance she would have said yes. Around June, my confidence in myself and the future was at an all time high.\n\n  June through September, I thought that we were okay. She still seemed to be reciprocating my attempts to spend time with her. Whereas before, I felt lonely, frustrated, and increasingly jealous of guys with a girl of their own over the building over the past several years, I was actually genuinely happy and content.\n\n As of now, she almost never returns my texts, starting on October 11th, and doesn't read them. Perhaps looking back, that she kept cutting our time together short starting around May, and the last time that we were together was in June should have been a warning sign. As should have been when I asked about seeing a movie with a friend she introduced me to, and forgot who I was talking about, which looking back was a foreshadowing.  One of her friends, who once called me my friend, also started ghosting me in October, even though I never asked why she wasn't returning my texts. And while it might well be that they are just busy, nobody should be too busy to return the occasional text, or tell someone they just won't have time to get together for X amount of time.\n\n As of now, I know that I need to move on, and I'll never do so as long as I'm alone like before I met her, so I've dusted off my dating profiles, and tried making adjustments. To be fair, I finally did get an honest-to-goodness first date, like my first ever. But it wasn't the fairy-tale ending I was looking for, and I rarely ever get any more matches. Which is not what I want. I feel that the longer I am alone again, the more depressed and bad about myself I'm going to feel. The way I see it, if she no longer wants to be friends with me, I should find someone to actually date, because that will help me feel happy again.\n\n I figure that there must be something I can do in order to get more matches. I was inspired by a post another member made about how changing out his wardrobe made an enormous difference, and women started to approach him in real life, which would work best for me, because I'm introverted, and find that it feels more natural when other people initiate.\n\n So I've taken photos of my Facebook dating profile, and posted them here. What can I do to improve it?\n\n [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/BLt2Usx](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/BLt2Usx)\n\n Living with my parents, not currently having a career, and no longer having a car are obstacles that I am aware of. I also have early onset male pattern baldness. The first two are not going to change for at least two years, and there is nothing I can do about it. \n\n Are these obstacles insurmountable? \n\n Is it my wardrobe that needs a complete overhaul + a new set of photos? What should I be wearing in order to attract potential matches?\n\n Can they be compensated\/overcome? I know that I'm not perfect. I'm not expecting whoever I date to be so either, but I am using that to drive me to improve myself by doing things such as going to the gym, and starting sessions with a personal trainer, and to overcome whatever the odds may be, and I hope to be extended the same consideration.","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1672877177.0},{"title":"What was your worse date of 2022?","author":"giantarmedwindmill","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/102wuki\/what_was_your_worse_date_of_2022\/","text":"Question inspired by the very funny \"come see my exhibition ;))\" date fail post.\n\nI broke up 4 months ago, so not many dates to report, but those I had mostly were shitshows. \nProps to the guy who made sure I'd pay for our coffees without acknowledging anything or thanking me, then somehow managed to brag about living on welfare while complaining foreigners are getting too many favours from the government.

He ended up yelling at me and ushering me out in the middle of the experience. I was told I need to be more respectful of people's time.\n\n\\_\n\nI liked this guy on Tinder because we're both artists and I thought his art seemed interesting. Normally I like profiles based on the bio only, but in this case I felt that the visual content was speaking enough (in addition to the brief bio), so I made an exception.\n\nUsually I want to exchange some messages before meeting up, to determine initial conversational compatibility. His responses were very limited. A couple words, a full sentence at best. I couldn't get any idea of his personality. But he was extremely busy building an exhibition, so I looked past that and made another exception to my rules when he invited me to see it. I know what it means to be insanely busy, it's how things are sometimes for artists. So I agreed to go see the exhibition, which was open for a limited time only. First I told him I might be able to do it on day X, but then some work stuff happened and I had to completely reschedule everything and was fully booked up until a trip to see my family for Christmas. I communicated this promptly.\n\nThe info I had of the exhibition was from its website: opening days, opening hours, free admission, address. A description saying that guests were intended to participate in it and influence the form it would take. Very intriguing, I thought!\n\nAt some point he mentioned he was running some equipment that makes it interactive to the visitors, and that he was there all the time. He also said the last day would be a week sooner than it says on the website, which made it a lot harder for me to come up with free time to visit. Upon returning from my trip, I let him know a new date that would work for me, and he said \"I can reserve you the 5:15 slot\". This seemed a bit odd, given that it was free admission and the opening hours were from ten to six pm - there was no mention that guests should have an appointment. I shuffled up my schedule to make that specific time work.\n\nOn the day of, I texted to double check we were still on, but received no response until 25 minutes before. The response was something like: \"I didn't think we needed another confirmation, but there are in fact some technical problems I need to take care of. So maybe another day?\" I was already on my way by then, and said so. He said it was okay.\n\nWhen I got there, the entrance to the building was locked (it's not a normal gallery space, it's on the top floors of a larger building). There was a sign on the door asking guests to call a phone number to see the exhibition. Some guy who was coming out just then let me inside, and I took a lift to the correct floor.\n\nHe met me there without greeting me at all, with slightly standoffish demeanor. I thought to myself he must be stressed out about the technical problems. There was no one else there. He explained the layout and the basic structure of the exhibition. He instructed me to first see a short film, then follow him upstairs. When I did, he was sitting behind the equipment desk and said \"since you came up so soon, you can go take a look in the other room over there\", which I did. To me, that comment sounded like \"you came up too early, I'm not ready yet\". So after the other room, I decided to go back downstairs to see the short film again, because it reminded me of the opening scene to my favourite feature film, and I very much enjoyed being immersed in it. I saw him still behind the desk, let him know I'm going back down, and that I'll be back afterwards. There was no response.\n\nWhen I wanted to go up again, the lift wasn't on my floor. There was a sign on it that said: \"Please use the lift. It's very slow but worth the wait.\" So I waited for a while, but it never arrived. There was a staircase, too, so I decided to use it to go upstairs. I reached a glass door, through which I could see my coat hanging in the rack I'd placed it in earlier. The door was locked, and no one seemed to be inside. I took the stairs further up, where one part of the installation was set up. I saw a hatch in the ceiling and a ladder leading up to it, and went to explore if I might be able to open the hatch. No such luck. I then went back down the stairs and double checked that I hadn't missed anything I could use to \"influence the events\". When there wasn't anything, I called the phone number he told me to call in case I needed to reach him.\n\nHe replied and said he was coming down. He handed me my coat, told me he closed the exhibition (20 minutes before closing time), and began reprimanding me on how disrespectful I was being of his time, yelling things like \"Care to explain why you disappeared for 20 minutes?\" but then not letting me get a word in edgewise. We got to the exit floor, he ushered me out and slammed the door shut, telling me to learn some manners.\n\nI find the whole thing hilarious, but I'm also a tad spooked that someone could be so harshly critical of me taking my time enjoying his art, and unwilling to discuss in a civil manner. It is now clear to me, in hindsight, that the intended participation was to happen *in the room with the equipment*, not in the other rooms. To him this was clear, of course, but I couldn't have possibly known that when walking in!\n\n\\_\n\nThis clearly isn't someone I'd like to get to know more, given the explosive temper. I did feel a deep connection to him via the art, and it's a damn shame that things had to happen the way they did. I sent him the following text:\n\n'Hey Name, I wanted to thank you for your time today and apologise for my part in the misunderstanding. Based on the info and opening hours indicated on the website, I was expecting to be able to look around and explore freely. After the fact, it occurred to me that I was intended to participate with the artist, not so much with the exhibition itself like I\u2019d thought. I wish there would have been a moment to calmly discuss the experience, because I was in fact enjoying myself quite a bit, until I got ushered out the door! I wish you all the best for the new year. Kind regards, Name'\n\nNot expecting a response, moving on. However, I'd love to hear everyone's ideas and suggestions wrt what you guys would have done differently, because in every experience, there is always something to learn.\n\n\\_\n\nETA: I see people asking how come I felt I have to apologise. I don't. It's just how I roll. Whenever I've been a part of a misunderstanding, I take responsibility for my part even when my intent wasn't malicious. What's more, in our country the professional art circles are quite small. It's fully possible that I'll run into him in a work context later on, so it's just the smarter thing to do to make it clear that there are no hard feelings - just to let him save face.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1672687234.0},{"title":"Intercontinental trip but he doesn't love me (yet)","author":"Slowlearner22","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/1021har\/intercontinental_trip_but_he_doesnt_love_me_yet\/","text":"**TL\/DR:**  My boyfriend and I are not on the same page in terms of our feelings for each other, and I would like advice about how to give him more time to develop deeper feelings and feel comfortable expressing them without damaging myself or the relationship in the process.

Whether it's us making assumptions about the other person or having assumptions being made about us. For example, a person said they got sick and needed to reschedule. when they contacted their match, the match stopped responding probably thinking they weren't being genuine. Another also involved being busy and needing to reschedule, but the person assumed that the other person had the worst of intentions even though it didn't come across that way for many other users. \n\nOne of the hardest parts about dating can be reigning in those automatic negative thoughts which act to protect us but also serve as a barrier that can prevent us from connecting with other people. In the prior examples, the people involved should have been able to at least meet their matches, but didn't due to assumptions guiding their actions on at least one side. These thoughts can lead to:\n\n* Over-generalizing(\"all guys are like\" this or \"if they wanted then they would respond soon\", etc..)\n\n* Catastrophic thinking(\"they're using less exclamation marks so they're becoming less interested\" or \"they didn't schedule a date immediately after the last one so they've probably met someone else\" etc..)\n\n* Drawing a selective inference(his body language was tense so he must not be into me)\n\n* Discounting the positive( despite the date going well, she asked to split the check, that's a bad sign)\n\nThese types of maladaptive and negative thinking patterns can lead us to personalize experiences even when they have nothing to do with us because we often have incomplete information. They cause us to try and become mind readers. As a result, we put up barriers that stop authentic connections from forming. These experiences compound and become self-reinforcing. The thoughts become even more automatic until we don't even realize they are happening. We treat every new experience like a continuation of the previous one even though every person we date is different and has their own circumstances. \n\nThis isn't to say that we shouldn't be aware of our own patterns when it comes to the people we select or be aloof to mistreatment. Dating begins with self-care.  We can't give grace to others when we aren't willing to give grace to ourselves. **What is your personal self-care goal this year when it comes to dating?**\n\nMine is to focus more on my hobbies. I dabbled in OLD during the middle part of last year and every time I did, I noticed I became more fixated on that rather than my hobbies and personal relationships. The more I focused on OLD, the less I felt I was spending on caring for myself and other relationships. I notice that when my relationship with myself and others is meaningful, I'm more than willing to give grace in my dating life without even having to think about it.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1672684645.0},{"title":"What are your biggest revelations about yourself as you've entered your thirties and how has it changed what you are looking for when dating?","author":"nachrosito","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/101idkd\/what_are_your_biggest_revelations_about_yourself\/","text":"I keep wondering because I think in my mid-20s I was looking for someone who was really like me in terms of mutual interests \/ and someone who was sensitive like I am.

Fast forward to NyE, I text in the early afternoon to confirm our plans. She mentioned her baby (one child) was not feeling well and that she was trying to get her parents to watch him. A couple of her friends flew in (she\u2019s from PA), so she still had them there since they were staying with her for a few days. I told her to lmk and that I could make other plans if it wasn\u2019t going to work. She only replied that she did want to meet me but had to tend to baby the last few days. Nothing either confirming or denying. So I made other plans and wrote it off.

I see a future with this guy, and ideally after my house sells I\u2019d like to move in with him and someday buy a house together. By the time I anticipate my house selling we would have been dating around 14-15 months.

I tried to write things in a way that shows off who I am as a person but doesn't get so hyper-specific as to deter people (e.g., referencing specific shows).

Got stood up for the first time last month and it really shook me. So here I am, putting myself out there, and somehow managed to get a date with a beautiful girl who I've been talking to on IG for a few months. She has \\*always\\* been a sporadic and random texter: messages can be long, or just an emoji, or no response at all. She had given me her # at one point, sometimes she messages from IG, sometimes via text. I mean, this girl is all over the place.\n\nI figured that date would be a total fail as she seemed to be responding sporadically over the last few days. But it turned out to be really good. She was talkative, lively, smiling, asked me lots of questions. The conversation was easy and flowed naturally. After a 2hr dinner, I walked her to her car, gave her a quick hug. She said she hoped we could do it again soon, and I agreed. I left feeling really good... until now.\n\nNo matter what happens, the before\/after of a date is just constant anxiety. I catastrophize leading up to it, then during the date I'm usually calm and relaxed. Afterward, I ride a rollercoaster of \"what ifs\" and can't seem to chill. It makes me feel like it's not worth it. I texted her late last night saying I got home safe (she asked me to), had a good time, etc. It's barely afternoon the next day and she hasn't responded. I realize that she's not communicating any differently than she did before the date, only now I'm having extreme anxiety, analyzing her social media posts, ughhghghghgh.\n\nReading the above, I sound ridiculous. I know what I need to do, I need to feel good that I had a great dinner in a great restaurant in a city I don't get to visit often. And leave it at that. I need to stay busy living my life, and if something comes of this, it will.

When we first started dating I had briefly skimmed his profile and who followed him, but I\u2019m not a huge social media user so I didn\u2019t investigate further. What I found made me very uncomfortable and I can\u2019t tell if it is because I was cheated on in my previous relationship or not.\n\nFirst, I saw that he follows a lot of fitness models. Muscle-y girls lifting weights and showing off their abs and ass. I know he is attracted that body type, and I\u2019ve been told I have it too (I have a huge problem with body dysmorphia that I\u2019m always working on). As I looked more, I realized that 25-50% of the 650-ish people he follows are some kind of \u201cfitness model\u201d whose feed is about 50% softcore porn. Some of the accounts were set to private, which could be totally normal, but I know that a lot of porn accounts are set to private and some of the avatars looked similar to the girls that my ex was chatting with him cheating on me with. \n\nIt freaked me out, so I kept scrolling and looking at the accounts to see if I was wrong. I was trying to prove to myself that it wasn\u2019t as many accounts as I thought, and that the account weren\u2019t that bad, but the more I looked, the worse it looked. So I scrolled all the way down in his \u201cfollowing\u201d list to see if it was just a weird pattern in the algorithm.\n\nI came across the account of a woman who, based on her bio and what I know about her, is obviously his most recent ex-girlfriend. She\u2019s got that fitness model vibe and her avatar is a photo of her showing off her abs. So he is following a bunch of scantily clad women and his ex-girlfriend (dunno if she is scantily clad because her account is set to private).\n\nHe lived with her at some point. According to him, she was abusive, hit him, they had a very volatile relationship, etc. I\u2019ve had some of this corroborated through comments from his family, so I think he\u2019s telling the truth about how awful she was. But even though they broke up a few years ago, when he and I first started dating, he had some of this woman\u2019s very personal property (can\u2019t tell you what or it would make the story too easily identifiable, but it wasn\u2019t nefarious or sexual, just something very important that she would want stored nearby), stored at his one bedroom apartment. He told me that he thought she had left it on purpose because she would want to wiggle into a relationship with him again at some point. He also said that she told him that she needed to leave it because she and her new boyfriend, now, husband, we\u2019re looking to buy a house and didn\u2019t have enough room in her apartment to keep it (I call bullshit because the items could fit in about 3-4 cubic feet of space). When I asked him about it further, he also said that he did not want to deal with communicating with her ever again, and that is why he didn\u2019t ask her to come get it when we started dating. Fairly recently we had an argument about trust and boundaries, and I brought up my discomfort with him, keeping the stuff stored at his place and a few weeks after that I was able to convince him that I really meant it and that it really bothered me and he called her to go pick up her stuff. He kept reiterating how much he didn\u2019t like her, how mean she was, and how much she didn\u2019t want to deal with her.\n\nSo why is he following her on Instagram? I can\u2019t think of any reason that makes me feel comfortable. Same for the question of why he is following so many booty fitness models. I feel flashes of PTSD from when I was cheated on, sure, but it also just feels gross and disrespectful. I also feel very insecure about my body, even though I objectively know there is nothing wrong with it.\n\nSo now I\u2019m lying awake in bed and I can\u2019t sleep and I\u2019m just stressing out over what all this means and how to talk to him about it. We are also supposed to go on a two day trip a few hours out of town. I was looking forward to this trip, and I was in a place to feeling secure and happy in our relationship, but now I just feel sick.\n\nAre any of these feelings reasonable? How can I deal with them?

They\u2019re always out somewhere with someone, usually fitting 2 different social things in one day.\n\nNow. I\u2019m not gonna tell an adult how to live their life. Good for them, have fun. But I don\u2019t know if *I* can deal with it.\n\nMy two pet peeves, involving this situation, is that a) they usually show up late when they do make plans and b) they make plans by saying \u201clet me wait till it\u2019s closer to Saturday so I can confirm the details\u201d. Which leaves me always waiting till two days before to even know what\u2019s going on.\n\nThey really, truly seem very interested. We\u2019ve started texting a lot more, they\u2019re very sweet, and we seem like a good match on paper (goals, values, lifestyle). It\u2019s just that that\u2019s how they treat everyone in their life. The last minute plans, the always a bit late, the needed to check work stuff. To them, this lifestyle is just normal.\n\nIf you dated\/date a busy person, how did that turn out? Was it a disaster? Did they improve later? Was it worth it? Terrible?\n\nAny advice is much appreciated.\n\n\u2014\n\nEdit: What is it with people asking \u201cWell if you want him to have money to give you a good life, how do you expect him to be free? You can\u2019t have both.\u201d?? Who said anything about me wanting a rich husband?? I make 150-190k a year and im a lesbian. Please stop projecting your issues onto my post.

By default I\u2019m pretty open to most topics but am now wondering if it\u2019s a problem.\n\nAfter many first dates I\u2019m starting to notice a trend: quite often, guys will share deep personal details and fairly raw self-reflections with me that I suspect they don\u2019t share with many other people in their lives. Things like family drama, traumatic experiences, breakup baggage, existential angst, nuanced political views etc. In some cases I\u2019ve even witnessed them working through fresh realizations in that moment as they\u2019re sitting in front of me. 95% of these dates are via apps, btw.\n\nOn the surface this has never seemed like a bad thing: I find these kinds of conversations interesting, it\u2019s good to know that they\u2019re capable of reflection and intimacy, and in theory you\u2019d think it would be a good way of connecting with another person. Also I would assume that if someone is comfortable getting into their deep dark stuff with me, the date is going okay.\n\nBut here\u2019s where I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s a bad thing:\n\n1. Guys who get into deep sharing territory seem to be more likely to ghost or slow fade before a second date. It gives me a bit of whiplash because these are usually the same guys who voice their eagerness for a second date while still on the first.\n2. Relating to the first point, I feel a bit like a therapist rather than their date. If I\u2019m into them and we\u2019re going to continue getting to know each other, great. But over the course of many dead-end first dates it gets exhausting and feels like work. If I\u2019m being honest I sometimes feel a bit used, emotionally.\n\nSome additional context: creating a space where people feel comfortable sharing their intimate personal experiences and non-judgementally listening to what they have to say is what I do professionally. I suspect that many of the things that serve me well at work bleed over into my personal interactions and have something to do with why dates tend to get emotionally intimate so early. But because it\u2019s second nature, I don\u2019t know how to turn it off. The people I work with sometimes share things that start crossing an ethical boundary, and I have tools for managing those situations in a work context. But those tools for managing disclosure don\u2019t translate well to a date interaction. For example I can\u2019t have them read a legal notice reminding them of the bounds of the interaction, because that would be\u2026 weird.\n\nSo guess my questions for you all are these: \n\nIs getting deep on a first date problematic? Any experiences from men who have shared deeply and then felt negatively or positively about it and why would be particularly helpful\n\nWhat are some tactics for keeping things light but not shutting down future intimacy?","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1672251424.0},{"title":"33M profile review!

It\u2019s been going really well. \n\nIn the past, I\u2019ve mostly dated emotionally unavailable men whose needs I placed above my own. I would jump into those relationships very, very fast, without evaluating if they would actually work for me. Since my last relationship ended - and after years of therapy - I\u2019m approaching dating\/relationships very differently. Looking for something much healthier. I also want kids and generally understand myself a lot better, so I\u2019m dating with intention (the intention being to find a life partner) and don\u2019t need to date for ages to figure out what I want. \n\nBut I\u2019ve never done this before and there\u2019s a part of me that no longer trusts myself to make the right decision, especially when I\u2019m infatuated with someone. \n\nSo far, the things that are important to me are there. Primarily (aside for being compatible in many ways), what I\u2019m most excited by is our incredible level of communication. We both bring up anything and everything that we want, are worried about, etc. He\u2019s also been in therapy for a while and has a good sense of self that he can articulate well. We both strongly believe that people should be willing and eager to grow over time, and that it\u2019s a life long process. I think this willingness is necessary for a successful relationship, which requires hard work, lots of talk, compromise, and the ability to weather the storms that come up. It feels like we have what it takes to build a strong partnership.\n\nBut still, there are things that can be dealbreakers or incompatibilities that will only be revealed with time. For example, where each person wants to live (what city, what type of environment). And I\u2019m having trouble figuring out what those things are. I have anxiety that I\u2019m going to devote all this time to this person only to find out it\u2019s not going to work and be even older and even more heartbroken than when I started. I understand that this is always a possibility - all relationships have the chance of ending one way or another. And I\u2019m not just trying to shoehorn this man into my life because I\u2019m desperate for kids. I want to make sure he\u2019s the right person to do that with first.\n\nBut I don\u2019t really know what to look for now that it\u2019s around the 2-3 months mark. What\u2019s normal at this stage? We haven\u2019t met each others friends or families yet and it wasn\u2019t something I was thinking about much but now I\u2019m starting to overthink it. We\u2019re going to a party with my friends soon and most of our friends\/fam live in the same city as us so it\u2019s not a logistical issue. \n\nI know 2 months isn\u2019t that long but my past experience has me gaslighting myself. I recognize that I keep approaching certain relationship questions from a place of fear and I\u2019m trying not to. But I\u2019m scared! \n\nWhat should we be asking each other and talking about? What should we be doing? What should I be looking out for?\n\nI have therapy next week and I\u2019ll talk about this then but in the meantime thought I\u2019d ask a bunch of internet strangers.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: thank you all for taking the time to share your advice! I really appreciate it. What makes the most sense from everyone\u2019s comments is to be watching out for consistency, day-to-day compatibility, how he shows up now that it isn\u2019t the first few dates and we\u2019re settling into more of a routine, and whether his actions match his words.

It's been made worse due to the holidays being here when everyone is busy. In particular, I(31m) asked out someone(27f) on a date who I've been interested in. This person seems to be interested in me as well. I thought that I might as well ask and get it over with so I could move on if I misread them. However, her response was \"This sounds great and so fun! I would so love to however I'll be going away this weekend on an X trip!\" It's a positive response, but I was left wondering if she really meant it and it left me feeling uncertain. When we talked about the holidays some days later, she told me she was going to be away and busy with family which is entirely normal. Afterward, I gave her a holiday gift of some small ornaments which she really liked and told me so multiple times. When I was leaving her, she even stopped me to remind me again how much she liked it, before hugging it. I think at this point my interest has been communicated.\n\nWhere I'm feeling stuck with trying to cope is trying to manage the uncertainty because now I have to wait until after the holidays. When I was younger in my 20s, I would have most definitely read it in a negative way and would have abandoned ship. This led to a lot of self-sabotage since I was letting myself get in the way of forming relationships with people. For whatever reason, I believed the idea that people should automatically prioritize us as much as we prioritize them. This probably came from reading too many dating advice sites. So for example, I automatically assumed busyness meant \"no\". I also confused initial spark\/chemistry with gauging how well a relationship could work when often those things were just me falling into comfortable familial patterns so I was really considering other great dates. None of these were healthy. Everyone is different, everyone has things come up, everyone has different communication styles, and it's also completely normal to not prioritize people we barely know. Good relationships take time to grow. Once I realized these things, the quality of my dating life, relationships, and my self-worth improved a lot.\n\nNow that uncertainty is coming back which is bringing some anxiety. My takeaway going into the holidays is that I should take this as a positive since her responses to me were positive. However, I'm afraid I'm going to self-sabotage myself because of the uncertainty of not knowing for sure which is where my mind is at. Even though I planned to send a happy holiday text during the holidays, I've even thought about just ignoring my text messages so I could not be preoccupied with this person. Or maybe I should and I'm overthinking it? Now I'm here wondering what everyone's experiences are with situations similar to this. I think just hearing how other people have dealt through uncertainty or overthinking could be helpful. Any advice is appreciated.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1671909327.0},{"title":"If you live in an area that doesn\u2019t have good public transportation, would you date someone who doesn\u2019t drive?","author":"m0rbidowl","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/zuarym\/if_you_live_in_an_area_that_doesnt_have_good\/","text":"First of all, I live in the US, which doesn\u2019t have good public transportation unless you live in select major cities (NYC, Chicago, Boston, etc).

Around mid November I got a message from a friend saying one of her friends was asking if she knew anyone single, so my name got mentioned. She (32) then found me on Facebook, thought I was cute etc etc and wanted to get to know me. The catch was she\u2019s long distance (about 90min drive) and has 2 young kids. But I thought hey why not. It could be interesting to see how this goes. Very rare for me to get set up. So we swapped numbers. \n\nThe next two weeks were like a whirlwind. Constant messaging, talking on phone \/ FaceTime for hours, we just seemed to have this crazy connection with so much in common. It felt like we were both really in to each other. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019d experienced any kind of connection like this. We then started making plans to meet up but at the same time it just began to simmer down. Messages were losing that spark of excitement and phone call lengths got less and less. I understood completely that she has a busy life as a working single mom so I put it down to that and me just overthinking it. \n\nLast week I sent her a long message just laying everything out, how I felt about her, would love to get to know her more but that I couldn\u2019t help notice the excitement had dissipated. She replied by largely reciprocating what I\u2019d said and explained how her life is so crazy right now and so just doesn\u2019t have time to dedicate to anything serious. I understood and respected her honesty completely. One thing just didn\u2019t make sense though. She reached out to me at the start. Her intentions were pretty clear so I was happy to be on board. But now I just feel really hard done by. I\u2019ve had similar conversations on OLD where it all sounds exciting and then they say sorry my head\u2019s not in the right place need to go sort myself out ok bye \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffb. \n\nSo now we\u2019re hardly messaging at all. I\u2019m just baffled by this whole thing. What was the point of it all? I get that these things happen but didn\u2019t expect it in these circumstances. Just feels like maybe she needed some validation. I hate thinking that might be the case as she came across as such a lovely person. I\u2019m so bummed about this.\n\nEdit: before it started to dissipate we did actually make plans to meet. But she cancelled a couple days before. We talked about getting together just before Christmas but just today she cancelled again.\n\nEdit 2: I had a catch up with my friend the other day and she filled me in on what she knew. It sounds as though this girl got distracted by another guy who she went to school with, dated briefly but they broke up after he was mean to her.

Lived all over the world. Met a guy while I was home visiting, had a whirlwind of a romance. I quit my job and moved home. \n\nHe has two kids from his previous marriage whom I adore. \n\nSince we were long distance for a while, when I moved back I stayed in an air bnb to acclimate. Then that got expensive so I moved in with my parents. It\u2019s been rough, not having a home and all. I\u2019m on edge. I\u2019m commuting back and forth to his place overnight for quite some time and was planning to move in in January. I was so excited to finally have a place to call home. \n\nHe has been upset with me lately for being negative. I understand that he is positive and doesn\u2019t want to be brought down. I do have some challenges with anxiety and depression and I\u2019ll admit that I complain a lot sometimes and I\u2019ve committed to stopping. \n\nWe have a therapist and just had a session this week. \n\nWe have been dating just over a year and plan on hosting Christmas Eve at his place and my family is coming. We are also planning to take his kids to Disney in March. We signed a lease in Arizona for a vacation property that we will spend 50% of our time at when we don\u2019t have the kids kind of going back and forth. \n\nIn the past when we fought it got very toxic. Emotionally abusive. Name calling threats insults silent treatment for days. It got really bad. Most of it did come from\nhim which he now admits. \n\nI ended things in September when I got tired of him being an absolute asshole to me when he was mad. He went to therapy, and he did seem to improve. It was ROUGH two months of fighting when we fought. But the we seemed to solve it. \n\nNow he\u2019s complaining about my negativity, which i accept. It seems that he doesn\u2019t want to hear any complaints from me in the moment that I\u2019m frustrated. Okay, fine. \n\nAnyway, without knowing the severity of this, I complained about my mom today. He said he didn\u2019t have capacity for it, so I asked when we could set a date to talk about it (there\u2019s an actual problem that needs a solution). He gave me a date. I dropped it and started talking about other stuff. \n\nAnyway he wouldn\u2019t drop it. Kept going and going about how this isn\u2019t resolved. What isn\u2019t resolved? I complained, you said no, we picked a date. Why couldn\u2019t we move on?\n\nWell from there his old near abusive (but not as bad) side kicked in. Later that evening he went off on me about how he doesn\u2019t want my mom coming to Christmas Eve, that I shouldn\u2019t come over tomorrow (when we were going to be preparing for dinner),and now that he doesn\u2019t want me to move in in January because I\u2019m \u201cToo chaotic\u201d and he doesn\u2019t want me and my family\u2019s chaos infecting his kids. I can understand that. But it was such a minor complaint (I\u2019ll post it in the comments) that I was surprised. Truth be told, things ARE chaotic. I\u2019m living with my mom, I have no space or privacy, I quit my lucrative job and am getting another degree and starting a business. It\u2019s chaotic. But we have discussed this and like two days ago he was counting down the days until I\u2019d move in and the chaos would be over. I decorated his whole house for Christmas, baked cookies with the kids, it\u2019s been lovely. \n\nNow he\u2019s afraid I can\u2019t handle the chaos of his life. He\u2019s an entrepreneur and we would be commuting back and forth between Arizona and Jersey a couple times a month. I tell him this is different because we have two HOMES. It\u2019s not a constant clusterfuck. \n\nAnyway, now he wants me to rent another air bnb for 2-3 months while he assesses if I can handle going back and forth to Arizona. It\u2019s $1800\/month for an air bnb, which is so much for me since I\u2019m not working. He doesn\u2019t seem to understand that bc he makes millions of dollars as an entrepreneur. I tell him and he doesn\u2019t care. \n\nI don\u2019t know. He\u2019s worried that my personality is just chaotic and the truth is that it kind of is. I go to therapy, I AM a therapist, I am committed but sometimes I don\u2019t handle my emotions well. I own that. \n\nSo he just dropped all of this on a few hours ago (in a mean, condescending way). I found an air bnb that would work. \n\nBut there\u2019s a little voice inside me saying\u2026this is your chance. Leave. Get out. I have enough savings to last me a little over a year and I should start making money within a few months. I could go to Arizona and rent my own air bnb for the same amount of money and not have to deal with his crazy schedule. \n\nBut I am 39 man. I don\u2019t want to date again. He\u2019s a good guy mostly, aside from these occasional totally mean outbursts. He has a beautiful house, he is smart, he plans dates, he takes care of himself, he wants a dog (but also hates my cat, which is a whole other issue). I know he loves me. \n\nAnd I understand that my negativity isn\u2019t cool and will fix it. It\u2019s also an opportunity for me to fix it, too. \n\nHis communication has improved so much since therapy and tonight was just a shock. I also think he was drinking.  But now I\u2019m up at 3am wondering if I\u2019m supposed to tell my mom we aren\u2019t going for Christmas Eve? Is it right for me to live in an air bnb to \u201cprove myself\u201d to this guy?\n\nI AM negative sometimes. Probably too much. He doesn\u2019t want me to bring him down and I get that, and I should fix that for me. \n\nBut that voice\u2026.when I think of leaving\u2026.I feel a little relieved. If my business were going I wouldn\u2019t be so afraid. I\u2019d probably leave tbh. I froze my eggs, i can still have a baby if I wanted. \n\nI\u2019m trying to decide if I should stick around for someone like this, or just leave. \n\nSometimes I just want to leave.\n\nEDIT: if I leave, where should I move to? I have Canadian and US citizenship, and have extensively traveled. I do have a cat who would have to come with me. I\u2019m into the spiritual stuff, maybe Austin?  Or maybe I could road trip Miami > Austin > Denver > Portland > Vancouver? With my cat, and work remote?

The matchmakers exchange your profiles with each other, and put you in contact if there's mutual interest. I said yes to talk to a guy, and I was told that he said no.\n\nOut of the blue about three months later, he emailed me asking for us to have the opportunity to get to know each other. He said something about how he didn't want to miss out on someone great because of the manner in which he meets that person, and he said he also wanted to \"explain something\". He didn't directly address that he wasn't interested in talking to me when we were paired by the matchmakers three months ago. (The service was $1200 btw. Kind of a lot, so I took it seriously and tried to be super open to the options I was given.)\n\nTo me it seems like he's just lonely because it's Christmas and he wants to call in backup. But maybe that's my low self worth or avoidance talking. I need a sanity check - is it worth entertaining this at all?\n\nEDITED TO ADD: the reason I'm asking is because I feel this is pretty different from swiping. You could swipe left on someone one hour, then right on them the next. Depending on how busy you are the convo may fizzle or one of you gets annoyed about something and unmatches. I don't think it says anything about interest levels. But this was a service where you're paying a lot for not a huge number of options so that to me means people really have to think about who they want to talk to, and try and be as open as possible. So it does feel more like an actual rejection. Thank you for all the advice and it's interesting to see how split people are.

I met a guy on OLD around 2 months ago, and we have had coffee a couple of times when our schedules lined up. I like him. He seems to like me. Daily contact, easy chit chat, he's my kind of tall, pale and dorky. But last night, the conversation led to me asking if he'd ever cheated before. He was honest and said he had, but he told his (then) wife, and it wasn't the reason the marriage ended.\n\nHis admission made my blood run cold. It was late, so I didn't continue on that topic, but I was discouraged that he didn't say it was something he deeply regrets or wish he could take back. Just that it wasn't what ended the marriage.

He thinks people say it too early, and I kind of get that. I asked him how he views being in love, because I always seek to understand him and his mindset better. He said he has only said it once and it took him two years, that\u2019s why he thinks it will take him a while and he just wants me to know. He said being in love for him is when you\u2019re ready to make significant sacrifices for the other persons happiness or to have them in your life. That sounds like a higher level commitment to me, and he was trying to move to another country for this ex, so that makes sense. I asked why he thinks it takes him a while to say it and he said it may be because his parents weren\u2019t affectionate with one another.\n\nI guess his explanation made me feel a little better about it, to understand it better. It\u2019s still not what I wanted to hear, although, I should say I have been asking myself how I feel about saying it as well. I haven\u2019t said it either, even though it has crossed my mind - I just express what I\u2019m feeling instead of saying those words.   I think of love as evolving and tiered kind of. The love my best friend has for bf at 3 months when they said it is obviously different than what they\u2019ll have at 2 years, and it\u2019s reassuring to hear it often along the way.\n\nI guess no one can really answer this for me, but the risk of relationships is challenging for me. That\u2019s why I avoided them for so long lol My current conclusion is to continue enjoying the moment and our connection and see where it goes. I may get to a point where I can\u2019t wait any longer or he may say it earlier than expected. It\u2019s still annoying though.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1671203595.0},{"title":"35M pic review","author":"scoobmx","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/znk32q\/35m_pic_review\/","text":"Hey, hi, yes it\u2019s me again, back at it.

In 2019 I met someone through friends, we had a great connection, but he was in a relationship at the time and I forgot about him. Fast forward to November and we matched on Tinder. I was elated.\n\nWithin 24 hours of us reconnecting, he accepted a job in the US that starts in early January (I am in Canada). It's a 1.5 hour plane ride or 6 hour drive away. He sees this as a permanent (or for the next while) move while he establishes his career. He's a dual citizen, and has lived in the city we live in for 15 years (like me).\n\nDespite knowing this, against my better judgement, I went ahead and dated him this past month. I just honestly have not had a connection like this with anyone since I met my ex, it feels truly special. However the reality of the situation is sort of destroying me and I don't know what to do. I feel so conflicted.\n\nHe's going through this major life transition and is giving me as much as he can, but I feel like I'm falling hard and he's not, or at least not as much. He talks about our great connection and how it's confusing him and making him question his plans, but he seems to actively be stopping himself from falling for me in the same way, though he's obviously also crazy for me. He's said as much. Maybe he doesn't want to fall in love right now and is holding back, or maybe he simply can't given he's undertaking this huge life change. It was all \"let's just see what happens\" at the beginning, and it's still like that, except I'm falling in love.\n\nMy fear is he is going to move to Big Fancy City, and forget about me, or I'll be relegated to this transition moment of his life, and eventually he'll move on, it will fade away. Or otherwise I'll be in a long distance relationship, which doesn't seem to gibe with this \"fresh start\" energy he's pursuing with this move. Not to mention the insecurity I might feel given he's in the city of hot beautiful successful women (I could myself as one of those types of women but I won't be physically present, and these other potential suitors will be).\n\nAnother factor is I'm kind of jealous of him. I was making plans to leave the city we currently live in myself, just for a place where I have citizenship (in Europe), because it's so hard to get a US work permit (though my first choice of a place to move has always been this Big Fancy City he's moving to, where I have spent some time).\n\nI feel terribly frightened for my heart.

I've gone consistently at least twice a week, and I've been as many as 5 days a week if my ex has the kids for the weekend and I don't have other commits.\n\nSo far I've dropped 15 pounds, down to 220. I'm 6' so 220 doesn't look bad on me, but I still have the dad bod. I've been talking to some friends about how to change that, and it looks like I pretty much need to change my diet, which is going to be a struggle. I'm not much of a cook and I've always been a picky eater, so I've got some work to do there. I'm trying to address the picky eater stuff in therapy (it's bordering on ARFID as I have an involuntary gag reflex with a lot of textures and some flavors, but I eat enough fried and processed garbage that I'm not malnourished, so technically it doesn't count). Despite our breakup (not the one from the OP, we got back together, had a wonderful month and a half together, then ended things amicably and are still friends), L is still going to help me learn to cook, so I'm working on that.\n\nAs far as how I'm feeling, it's fantastic. I have more energy, I can sprint up 3 or 4 flights of stairs at work without feeling winded, and I've never felt better about my body than I do now. I'm consistently running a mile in ~12-13 mins now, and I'm doing about 30 mins treadmill to start my workouts. I'm doing more sets of more reps or heavier weights, I'm benching and squatting ~110, I'm leg pressing ~200, and I can manage like 10 assisted pull ups with a ~100lb counterweight. 8 can also consistently hit 30 pushups, 30 situps, and most importantly, I can keep up with my kids without an issue.\n\nOverall, it's been going super well for me, and it's really boosted my confidence. It's also given me a consistent reason to get out of the house and be among people (even though it's the gym and literally the most I've said to anyone is \"are you using that?\"), which has been good for my depression too.\n\nLooking ahead, for long term goals, in terms of fitness I want to get to ~200lbs, I want to drop 4 inches on my waist (from 36\" down to 32\") so I have a much wider selection of pants that fit. In terms of strength, I want to be able to bench and squat 200, and I want to be able to do 10 pullups without assistance. All of this seems achievable within the next 6-12 months so long as I consistently put in the work (and assuming I can improve my diet, which I'm trying but is really hard).\n\nMost importantly, I'm taking time for myself consistently to do something I enjoy that makes me feel better about myself, and the importance of that can't be overstated.\n\nI want to thank everyone who commented on the OP with advice and encouragement, the early days were really hard for me physically but your faith in me helped keep me going. This sub has been a wonderful place, and I'm really glad I found it.\n\nI have gym progress mirror selfies but can't post them here, so I guess DM if you want to see?","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1670991774.0},{"title":"Dating rants. vents and open discussion","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/zli1ze\/dating_rants_vents_and_open_discussion\/","text":"Need to commiserate?

Then I asked how she\u2019d feel about us exploring dating. \n\nShe seemed pretty surprised at first and said \u201cyeah, we can do that\u201d.

I asked her how she was feeling about it all, and she brought up some concerns that I had flagged as well in my reflections: she\u2019s not sure she\u2019s as ready for something serious as I am\/that she\u2019ll run away when things get serious, worried about hurting our friendship, and how we\u2019d need to have a lot of open communication around everything as we move forward. \n\nWe made a plan to go climbing Thursday (we usually go climbing once or twice a week together) and kinda left it at that. I could feel my face really flushed from nervousness\/vulnerability, and we had a good hug and I left to head home. \n\nSo overall generally (cautiously?) positive. We\u2019ll see how things land in a few days once she\u2019s had more time to reflect.

Here is the update:\n\n\\- Because I couldn't make up my mind about being exclusive, she ended up seeing another guy and slept with him (not sex but 2nd or 3rd base). She is started to have feelings for him and wants to test the waters.\n\n\\- She wants a long-term partner and doesn't believe I have those qualities. She calls me fun, sexually attractive, and that we have a strong intimate connection, however she believes this other guy has  long-term qualities she desires (security, how he treats her, stability, etc.).\n\n\\- She thinks I am short-term potential because I am not sure about what I want in life, what I want in a partner, and where I plan to live long-term, etc. She thinks I need more time to think about it.\n\n\\- Since I am going away for a few weeks, she suggested we pause things and talk about this after. She will continue dating and see this other guy while I am away.\n\n\\- She feels regretful that she dated someone else, but I understand its also my fault for being indecisive and not being clear with my intentions. I wanted to 'have my cake and eat it too' by seeing both Girl #1 and Girl #2. Eventually I didn't see Girl #1 because I was deciding what to do. \n\nFor Girl #2, have I made a mistake in not agreeing to exclusivity when I had the chance? I did want to be casual with her, but then had second thoughts because I did like her and wanted to have a gf. There is still a chance for us but because of all the things she has said, and because I have competition now, I don't know how strong my chances are. A part of me also wonders if this will even work out if it does.\n\nFor Girl #1, I plan to talk to her and tell her the truth. I will let her know I've been casually dating others and that I am still unsure of what I want. Because she is the second option in this situation, I wonder if its better for me to let her go so I don't hurt her feelings, or whether we should continue casually (if she agrees), because also 'a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush' (sorry for the poor metaphor to describe this situation). I do like her but I just feel like my feelingsd are stronger right now for Girl #2, but that could change.\n\nWhat's your guys take on this situation?

However, the last few days I\u2019ve been letting my past 2 dating experiences get into my head and overthink everything.\n\nWe had sex for the first time earlier this week, so things are progressing pretty naturally. I think he\u2019s a good person and am definitely really starting to like him. We both have stated that we are looking for a genuine serious connection, which is something I didn\u2019t do with either of my last 2 \u201crelationships\u201d. I fell hard for them without having the important convos like what they were looking for, goals, kids, future stuff, etc. so at least I\u2019ve gotten one of those things out of the way.\n\nWhen we hang out, we don\u2019t really ask each other questions anymore, more just enjoy each others time, which is fine, but I don\u2019t want this to end up like the other guys. How do I go about bringing these topics up? Especially if we\u2019re just like watching a movie or having a casual conversation. I\u2019d like to have these convos in person, rather than text\u2026\n\nI know it\u2019s still very early and maybe not even time to have these conversations yet. I just am curious as to how maybe some of you have brought up these tough conversations.\n\nThanks in advance!","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1670791211.0},{"title":"Would it annoy you if your date wasn\u2019t as adept as you at a hobby?","author":"xpensivewino","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/zjpy2c\/would_it_annoy_you_if_your_date_wasnt_as_adept_as\/","text":"So I recently went on a 2nd date with a guy. We went cross country skiing bc we established on the first date that it\u2019s an activity we both enjoy. \nNow I\u2019m an ok skier, I\u2019d say I tend to be faster than the newbie\/casual skiers but not nearly as fast as the skiers who race or do serious miles multiple days a week. It\u2019s just a fun activity I can do with my dog on the weekends in the winter. \n\nThis guy is like a crazy fast, fit, advanced skier. Like he grew up his whole life skiing. I could tell if he had wanted to, he coulda left me in the dust and done 3x the distance we covered in a couple hours. \n\nWe made great conversation the whole way though and he had a blast racing my dog to her max a couple times, but I was left wondering if he was annoyed that he had to hold back bc of me and now he\u2019s thinking well, she\u2019s not really a suitable activity partner when it comes to this. \n\nWhat do you think?","upvote_ratio":0.74,"created_utc":1670826556.0},{"title":"She's \"Never Been Kissed\"","author":"PoliticalPartyDrone","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/datingoverthirty\/comments\/zjm3oc\/shes_never_been_kissed\/","text":"Recently, a family friend reached out to my parents about setting me (39M) up with the daughter (30F) of a friend of his.  Initially, I wasn't open to the idea as I was still getting over a serious breakup but once that passed, I asked the family friend for her number.\n\nWe've been texting and that's been going well.  We had a video chat earlier today, which also went well but she said something during the video chat that threw me for a loop.  She asked if I ever had a girlfriend before and I told her I had.  She then told me she's never had a boyfriend, although she's always wanted one, and she's never even had her first kiss.  She did explain that she's been very driven in her education and her career and she is also very shy.  This led into a conversation about our priorities with work and life so we didn't linger on it but I am worried about it.\n\nI've been in a number of serious relationships, including an engagement in my early twenties that ended when my ex-fianc\u00e9e cheated on me.  I've also had two relationships that nearly had proposals but those didn't work out when it became apparent we wanted different things in life (a conversation I learned to have BEFORE the proposal due to how things ended with my ex-fianc\u00e9).\n\nObviously, it's important to let things happen at a pace she's comfortable with (something that's true even if she had been in relationships before or if she wasn't a connected to a family friend) but I'm still concerned about our mismatch in dating experience.\n\nIf anyone has any advice or thoughts to keep in mind here, I'd greatly appreciate it.
