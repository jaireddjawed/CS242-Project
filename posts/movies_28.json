        "text": "I like this movie, it’s well crafted, well written, and has something to say. And Mads Mikkelsen is brilliant as always. I just don’t understand the narrative of EVERYONE believing a 5 year old child about something so drastic. It makes sense for Klara’s parents to believe her, but why anyone else? I certainly wouldn’t take the 5 year old’s word, and I doubt many would. I’d begin to believe it’s true if others said the same, which they did, but why did the other kids lie? Klara very clearly lied because of the feelings she had for Lucas, but why the others? \n\nAlso, I think it goes without saying that the reaction of the community is far too exaggerated. Banning his son from a supermarket serves no purpose, and then he gets assaulted for shopping. It takes away from the realism of what’s happening. And killing his dog? What the fuck? Only a sociopath would do that. \n\nI definitely have more good things than bad to say about this movie, but I don’t get why more people don’t talk about these parts of it.",

The first time I ever watched the matrix was somewhere around 2002, i was 10 years old and I watched it with my mother on her laptop. She had the dvd and it was both our first times seeing it. \n\nThis may be slightly biased, but to me this is a comfort movie. With full and upmost honesty, it’s probably because my mother was the first person to show me it, but to me the matrix is like a complex bowl of the most delicious soup you’ve ever tasted. The more you get into it the better it gets. Every time I watch it I see myself sitting in my moms bed, with the ever so small 8X6 probably Nextel laptop, in her bedroom with the cheesy canopy cast iron fittings. The green 0’s and 1’s flashing vertically down the screen and being so young, I had no idea what was going on ( come to find out most adults didn’t either) but regardless it was the first time I can remember being mesmerized by a movie. \n\nThere’s a lot of theories on the true meaning of the movie and what the director was trying to convey and I think that’s another thing that makes this movie so great. \n\nTo me though, it will always be a masterpiece in film and a lasting memory of my love for good movies and my love for my mom. \n\nMy question is, are there any movies that your parents showed you that you will forever remember and why?",

It would be a unique and a bold idea\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings I do not want to see in Scream:\n\n\\- more cliche one-liners of come at me \"B\\*\\*\\* or come and get me Mother\\*\\*\\*\\*\" like I always found those one-liners annoying and laughable in the wrong way\n\n\\- One big thing I don't want to expect would be the cheap reveals for the killers, I thought amber's reveal in scream 5th was pretty obvious, She was a effective killer but plot twist-wise, She was the complete opposite \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll check this movie out at 3/11/23 Sat                                                                                                                           I cannot wait to check this movie out and I hope this sequel will satisfy me as a scream fanatic \n\nWhat are your thoughts? what would you like to see in Scream IV",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/11mk011/lets_talk_about_oldboy_2003_i_saw_that_coming/",
        "text": "Disclaimer; This post will be HEAVY with spoilers so continue at your own risk. \n\nAt the behest of several movie critics I follow and the internet at large, I finally watched Oldboy (2003). It’s a Korean psychological thriller with a twist and that’s the extent of what I knew going into the film. This is because I largely like to watch movies without learning too much background and because I was warned that researching too much would spoil the twist. This amazing 10/10 twist. Cool, understandable. So I go in blind. And WOW, what a disappointment. \n\n\nIn order of things that pissed me off:\n\n\n1. The main protagonist eats an octopus in the film. It was a gross scene and made me uncomfortable but whatever, it’s a movie. Or so I thought. Imagine my horror to learn that these fuckers that made this movie actually filmed and recorded the main actor devouring FOUR live octopi, on FOUR different occasions for FOUR different takes. Shock value just for the sake of shock value. Seeing any animal cruelty like this for a *movie* would have been upsetting to me but Octopus are legitimately as intelligent as dogs, likely more so. They use tools, recognize people’s faces and build cities. And this actor bit the heads off of four of them. For a movie shot. Disgusting and cruel. \n\n\n2. Main protagonist goes to rape a girl in the bathroom. She freaks out and fights him off, no rape happens. That’s fine; again it’s a movie and I don’t mind that there was or could have been a rape scene. However, it’s the reaction to the rape scene from the victim that just pissed me off. The girl come out of the bathroom, comforts her almost rapist and says “Next time don’t stop, Just rape me.” Wtf? It immediately took me out of the movie because no sane person would say that. Later, it could possibly be explained away with maybe being a consequence of her hypothesis (Is that hinted at? I hope so because otherwise this dialogue is one of the most bizarre responses ever) But even if so, it totally took me out of the movie at the time and I just side-eyed the whole relationship. \n\n\n3. I guessed the “twist” immediately so it had no pay off. How did anyone not, lol? From the beginning of the movie, the main point is he’s going to see his daughter for her birthday. She’s mentioned several time in the first couple minutes but we never see her. It’s clear she’s very important to him and very important in the context of the film. He gets out, and goes to the restaurant and sees the young girl and she says “Oh, you look familiar.” He says “Oh, you do too.” There’s no reason for her to know who he is unless she knew him before he got taken and she would have had to have been a child at that time. The first logical thought is “Oh that’s his daughter”. A moment later, the film tries to throw you off by saying the daughter is in Sweden, basically saying “look away from this obvious women in front of him”. Except again, the film has already established that the daughter is going to be important. So the fact that he doesn’t call or contact her in anyway is ridiculously suspicious and basically continues to scream that the girlfriend is his daughter. \n\n\nThere’s more but those are my biggest grips. I was really excited for a fun twist but it was so obvious and boring and I hate that I wasted 2 hours on this movie without even a payoff. \n\n\nI accept that I won’t ALWAYS enjoy films that others think are the bees knees but I’d love to hear from people who like’d the film. Maybe I can come at it from a different perspective, idk. \n\nAlso feel free to recommend other psychological horror films!",

And she mentioned something about half of London knowing something? Was Mr. Williams walking around with Ms. Harris? Is she who she was referring to?\n\nI loved the movie by the way. I just could not understand some of the dialogue unfortunately. Bill Night gave a wonderful performance. The entire cast did. I am so glad I was able to catch a showing of it tonight. The music was also incredibly moving, and complemented the film very well. This movie makes me want to check out some of Bill Nighy’s other performances. Again I thought he was just spectacular in this movie. I am so happy he received an Academy Award nomination. It is well-deserved.",

I was fully expecting it to be a superhero parody, but it actually had great moments that were serious!\n\nFor example, the scene where Megamind and Roxanne are having their confrontation in the rain I love how well the animators put so much attention to detail on Megamind’s facial expressions it says so much with very limited words! You understand both sides of them, but it really speaks so much about Megamind as a character! \n\nHe was never someone who enjoyed being evil, he only became a villain cause his environment made him believe that was his purpose. When all he really wanted was to feel accepted and loved, but has made himself believe he can never have any of that.",

It was surprisingly good. I expected just a fun Gerard Butler action movie, but something about it just felt like a fun 90's action movie but with more heart.\n\nMike Colter stole every scene and I'm happy for him. He did a Q&amp;A at a convention for Luke Cage and he seemed like an extremely nice guy and funny too. Seeing him go thru town with a sledgehammer was awesome and I wanted more of that. At the end of the movie when Mike Colter goes off into the jungle, I left thinking \"Wow, I actually want to see a sequel to that.\" \n\nSo when I read the article saying they are starting production for \"Ship\" the sequel to \"Plane\", the title made me laugh out loud and I said \"Yes!!!\". Will it be called just \"Ship\"? Or something like \"Plane II: Ship\" or maybe even \"Ship: A Plane Saga\".\n\nIs anybody else excited for Ship? Did you think Plane was a pleasant surprise as well? Do you think Plane should be considered for any Academy Awards and next year's Oscars?",

Then 2015 comes around and so does The Martian, another incredible space movie. So began the space movie phenom. \n\n2016 had Arrival, A literal work of art of a film. Although not set in space, I lump it in with the preceeding space films due to it's plot &amp; exploration on what the hetapods want. 4 years in a row of epic space Sci-Fi. \n\nIn 2017, we got Alien Covenant and Life, the former being a good addition to the Alien franchise, albiet a slight let down (to me anyways), whereas Life was very, very average (to me). We also got Blade Runner 2049, which is the film I would place as the top dog space film of the year.\n\n2018 gave us First Man, another superb addition to this little genre. This year also gave us Prospect, Annihilation, and High Life, all of which are excellent films deserving a spot alongside these others. \n\n2019 had Ad Astra, a great film and another great entry into this list. At this point, we've had some big, great films almost every year, and other smaller scale Sci-Fi films that also fit into this category that have been amazing. 7 years of beautiful space films. This is the point where things start to slow down. \n\n2020 had none. 2021 had Dune, which I feel can be included here, as it definitely feels like a huge space epic, and seeing it in theatres was an awesome experience. \n\nI feel as though 2022 had none that would fit in the epic space category either. Outside of the Marvel films, 2023 looks to have only one promising space epic film in Dune Part 2, but it being a sequel shows that the yearly original space epic's are definitely slowing down. Could we be feeling space fatigue, much like superhero fatigue post endgame? Why do you think there are less and less big budget space films being made as each year goes on? I can't wait to go see the next big space film at the cinema, but aside from Dune part 2, there seems to be nothing like them on the horizon (except Mickey 17).",

        "text": "I've read so many \"explaining interstellar\" articles which really just say what you see happens in the movie and doesn't explain anything, and read every reddit \"Interstellar explained\" post and still don't understand something. I get pretty much everything about the movie except the one detail of Cooper sending himself to NASA in the first place by inputting the coordinates of the base in the bookshelf. In the flow of time, Cooper would have never gone to the NASA base and therefore the mission where he goes into the black hole and then thee tesseract/bookshelf, if those coordinates hadn't appeared. So how would his future self do that when his future self never would have been there without that happening in the first place?! I understand everything else about the tesseract and blackhole. I know the theories.. But this is my one question. If they had just done every single other thing that happened with the bookshelf EXCEPT Cooper being the one to send himself to NASA (?) it would have been a perfect movie and made complete sense. They should have had all the bookshelf ghost stuff happen and then Professor Grant come to his house to ask him to fly for their mission because he was a great pilot. Anything other than his future self who was only there because he went to NASA be the one who sent him to NASA. That's a paradox that I can't find an explanation for. Anyone? \n(I love the movie still by the way)",
