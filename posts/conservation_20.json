        "text": "Hey I don’t know if this is even the right place for this question but I figured I’d give it a shot and see where it takes me.  My whole life I’ve been interested in the environment and what we can do to help take care of it (thanks Captain Planet).  Well this month I’ll be turning 30 and recently became a new father and all this is really changing my priorities in life as one would imagine.  I really want to dedicate my life to helping protect the earth for future generations but can’t think of a way I could that doesn’t involve going back to school and putting myself in more debt. I’m still young and very able and know I could offer a lot to the conservation effort.  If anyone has any suggestions or places to start looking to help start this journey for myself or anyone else reading please feel free to comment!  Thanks for much for any ideas or comments you all might have!",

We use free stock image, and our goal is to, in a very light way, make everyone that listens to our music, **fall in love with nature images.**\n \n \n**We have been using stock videos, but I wanted to know if anyone here is interested in sending us video footage that maybe laying around with no use at all.

No problem.\n - Arguably more hygienic than air hand dryers\n - Reduce paper towel usage\n - Use it to open the bathroom door if that's your thing\n - Also comes in clutch when you spill a little coffee in the car\n\nI've been carrying one to school for a month now and I estimate that I've saved like 50 paper towels. I throw it in the wash after a few days and rotate hand towels. \n\nWhat do you guys think? If most people had one, do you think it would make any difference? It certainly makes me feel better.",

When I asked them about their apparent support of her, Kathleen M Kalina responded:\n\n\"Levqe is not affiliated not a member of womenhunters.  You have a fake news.   If you go to womenhunters.com you will not find the article you sent me.\"\n\nAfter multiple back-and-forths, it's become clear she is incapable of understanding that this link exists on their site, just because it's no longer linked directly from the front page.\n\nSo here's my question:  What can be done about organizations like this that push legal and ethical boundaries for their own personal enjoyment, at the expense of biodiversity?  Are there legal consequences that can be brought to bear on an organization that embraces such bad behavior, then cynically tries to erase history instead of owning up to and learning from their mistakes?",

        "text": "I'm a 25 year old software developer who is finally realizing I chose the wrong career. I've always loved conservation (and animals), which drove me to get a biology degree in college. However, I went to a small school and my biology program was akin to pre-med. I struggled through courses such as Calculus and Organic Chemistry, and ultimately resolved that I may not be cut out for bio. I did graduate (although my GPA was not great), and learned to program immediately after graduation. My primary focus was and is still animals, and I'm currently developing an application (on my own time, I now work as a developer for a pretty typical tech startup) I hope will benefit them. However, every day I go into work I can't help but acknowledge the fact that I don't enjoy the work I do and although I'm glad I learned to program, it's really my goal that motivates and excites me, not my job. I want to spend my life doing something I love, not dread my 9-5 M-F. I have looked into conservation science in the past and again now, and have always feared it is too competitive a field to enter - even with my BS.\n\nI'm at a crossroads - I want to pursue conservation science, but I don't know if it's realistic that I can support myself with it. I'm still paying off college loans, so I don't have much saved up. I know conservation jobs typically require years of experience (which students get over the summer through volunteering and internships), of which I have none. I really just wanted to ask any advice or opinions of those who work in the field - is it feasible to enter conservation science at my age, with no past experience? What would the road ahead of me look like? How could I support myself? Thanks so much to all who took the time to read and I would greatly appreciate any feedback.",
