As in, conclusively deciding on one particular outcome, communicating it to the reader and sticking with it. \n\nA conclusion can be the definite reveal of a mystery, the outcome of a fight, the true power of a character - or his death. \n\nBut even after 1000 chapters, Oda doesn't seem to like providing us with definite conclusions, for the most part. \n\nDeaths can often be fake. Big mysteries are still unrevealed. Even if they are revealed, there's still a chance it won't be the real or final answer (see devilfruit origin). \n\nInstead of clear, conclusive fights, we often just get skirmishes that don't allow for any conclusions. How much stronger was Fujitora than Luffy in Dressrosa? Did Greenbull fear Shanks, the RHP or could he just not be bothered? Did Shanks fight Kaido to stop him? How? We don't know, we might never know. \n\nYes, set up is important. But at this point I fear Oda doesn't really want to provide definite answers.",

After the time skip it seemed like Ussop had actually developed and overcome a lot of his wimpy decisions and dialogue. With each new scene it looked like it was the real deal and not a facade, sure he still had these moments but they were limited compared to pre time skip at least imo. As I got closer to Dressrosa and now having experienced a frustrating decision he made, it seems like Ussop is a character who goes 1 step towards his goal and two steps back.\n\nAm I missing something about his character/progression because the other characters on the crew seem to have kept their time skip progression, especially nami and chopper.",

        "text": "I feel the traitor is actually a new character to which we haven't been introduced yet.\n\nPossibly a forgotten clone of VP\n\nHere are my reasons:\n\n\\- I had my doubts on 01 VP, Shaka but now since he's been shot it's clearly not him. Other satellites were either turned to rock or they were with other members of the crew when all of this was happening.\n\n\\- Also we know it's not Bonney as someone locked Cipher Pols before Bonney arrived on the island. So it's someone who has been with VPs all along but since it was not noticed by other VPs probably this one knows all the loopholes and cameras and is older than current VP satellites.\n\n\\- Also we know it's a VP cuz who else can order seraphim on the Island.\n\n\\- I initially thought there's a similiraity between 7 deadly sins and satellites (because of greed and violence) but then I saw Shaka represents **Good** . So there goes my Deadly sins theory down the drain, but wait a sec!!!! On [OP fandom](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Vegapunk#Satellites) it's written, \"They (referring to satellites) also use different first-person pronouns and speech patterns.\" So, I did some google search and I found there are **8 first-person modern Japanese pronouns.**\n\nSo we have 6 satellites and 1 main VP which means there still remains one VP satellite that is still yet to be introduced. So it was probably some satellite/clone which was considered a failed experiment (considered 'failed' for some stupid reason), and now it's taking revenge.\n\nNow, why do I think it's someone from VP's past? Well, it's because the person used a gun and bombs to take down \"Shaka\" and other satellites on an island with f\\*\\*king laser beams, plus he/she knows the island all too well. If he/she was a modern satellite/clone he would have used a laser or some futuristic weapon but since it's shown that \"the clone\" is using old-age weapons it was probably forgotten or has been hiding from VPs and waiting since then to take its revenge.\n\nLet me know what you think about this theory.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Justice vs Freedom](https://preview.redd.it/alzknpesvnma1.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f6a01ef8d6bdb65d26c52b7c598110144b4ff2f4)\n\nNow that we are entering the final stages of the story we are going to start getting more and more final match ups and one such match up I can genuinely see if Dragon vs Akainu or even Sabo vs Akainu, though in my ideal world I would love to see them tag team him because if Dragon does in fact have the wind logia fruit? That in combo with the fire logia would be a DEVISTATING combo, especially if they are both awakened. Dragon is more likely to be awakened, Sabo? I feel he could awaken during the fight given how fast he's getting used to the Mera-Mera no mi. \n\nBut I hear you ask \n\n\"Why would Dragon or Sabo wanna fight Akainu and why would Akainu care about either of them?\"\n\nWell Sabo would wanna fight Akainu for um...obvious reasons.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/siauk1xgjnma1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=43e4df1bcd5bc0583bb40a74cd2d483f45bba2c3\n\nAnd Akainu has a very obvious HATE boner for Dragon; seriously take a shot every time Akainu screams **\"DRAGON SON!\"** at Luffy during Marineford, you'll be drunk within the hour. Considering that Dragon is Garp's son and leader of the direct opposing force to the marines and the world government; Akainu as the fleet admiral is in a way obligated to fight Dragon to be honest.\n\nThe popular theory is that back in their youth Dragon and Akainu used to be friends; perhaps even sworn brothers over sakzuki exchange similar to Ace and Luffy and Sabo but because Dragon found out how horrible the world government is and how corrupt the Marines were, he left and Akainu felt betrayed by that. Perhaps Dragon was even in line to become an admiral and that's how he got his wind logia fruit but after getting it he defected and the marines/WG branded him as the worlds worst criminal, perhaps he even killed a Celestial dragon or at the very least harmed one.\n\n[Former brothers in arms](https://preview.redd.it/tnvff4iamnma1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=25989824fb7fee2b5fefee59f1b4a9535ed13245)\n\nNow when you consider the elemental advantage here, on the surface you would think that Akainu has the advantage BUT if dragon has the Wind logia and is awakened and can effectively cause storms whenever he wants? Akainu is gonna be heavily nerfed because his lava would constantly be getting cooled. Plus if Sabo is in the mix and he awakens the power of the flame fruit? We could see him busting out blue or white fire to fight Akainu and that would give him the attack power he needs on top of his haki to damage Akainu.\n\nHonestly this shouldn't be a hot take but I'll say it anyway: I firmly believe all 3 of these characters will have conquerors haki. Dragon is the father of Luffy and the son of Garp, no shit he's gonna have it. Sabo is being called Flame Emperor right now and he's already pretty solid at haki, Ace had conquerors too but his ambition fizzled out under Whitebeard. Akainu? Sengoku, the fleet admirals before him has conquerors and just look at Akainu's personality and even the devil fruit he has, I would be shocked and frankly disappointed if he didn't have conquerors.\n\nWe know he's at least got advanced armament from what he aided in doing at marineford and he's probably got good observation too, so having conquerors would just make a lot of sense for someone as destructive as Akainu and that's not even taking his awakening into account which I am certain he has.\n\n[Justice's might is ABSOULTE](https://preview.redd.it/vosssmgpmnma1.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2e481701df087b9d477fb31bb16143fb0806e91c)\n\nAkainu's awakening is going to turn anywhere he is standing into a volcanic hellscape where he is the master of everything that goes on and so in order to fight a force of nature you must BE a force of nature and I feel like Dragon and Sabo are the only ones besides Aiokiji that could survive in the conditions Akainu would create. In addition I think Akainu in particular is so skilled at this that he's capable to giving life to the magma in a sense and can create creatures and constructs out of magma or Obsidian. \n\nGiven his epitaph is \"Red-Dog\" its logical to assume he would probably create a giant magma hound or even a magma cerberus to attack his enemies with.\n\nI could also see him creating an Obsidian sword since I do believe in his younger years he did use a sword(correct me if I am wrong)\n\nThough if I am being honest I feel his ULTIMATE ability would be something similar to what Enel did when he turned into Amaru or Enaru depending on the translation.  So in Enel's case he was referencing the Shinto God of Thunder: Rajin or Raiden. In Akainu's case his big transformation would be a reference to the Hawaiian volcano goddess Pele with an appearance similar to Te-ka from Mona.\n\nWhat I imagine Akainu doing is turning the entire landscape into a volcanic wasteland and its dotted with smaller volcano's but then one MASSIVE super volcano that would be a reference to the Mauna Loa which is the largest active volcano in real life; that would sprout from the middle of the battlefield and Akainu would literally ERUPT out of the volcano looking like this thing below.\n\n[BURN PIRATE SCUM!](https://preview.redd.it/205sxirgqnma1.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=535b9cc73eb20453c9eb716a3dfbcd55c3b622b0)\n\nAnd in this form Akainu has absolute control over the environment and to a degree the weather because volcanic eruptions do in fact cause weird weather patterns that Akainu could use for attacks. To mention he could simply retreat into the volcano to heal should he start taking a lot of damage. Keep in mind as Akainu has this awakening active volcano's would be erupting CONSTANTLY and so if you aren't a logia with an elemental protection or advantage like Kuzan? You are FUCKED the moment Akainu even activates this, you'd either be melted by the lava or choked by the toxic fumes coming off the multiple volcano eruptions.\n\nBecause yeah, Luffy is the sun god and has all his whacky cartoon powers but rubber can still melt and burn, that toon force durability will only take you so far and against Akainu I don't think Luffy would be able to keep up Gear 5th long enough but maybe I am giving Akainu too much credit. Still, I am looking this from an element vs element standpoint. Luffy would still be involved in the fight though I think he would relay less on Gear 5th and use a more amped version of Gear 4th in order to make maximum use of his haki or maybe he has something else with gear 5th that would give him the edge. Hard to say really.\n\n*Processing img 90x50ik4nnma1...*\n\nBut yeah the characters best suited to fight Akainu are really Sabo and Dragon in my opinion but that all hinges on Dragon having the wind logia. The most popular theories for Dragon are the following\n\n* Wind Logia\n* Storm Paramcia\n* Storm mythical Zoan(Dragon or thunderbird)\n\nIn my opinion the most likely is the wind logia fruit based on everything we have seen in the story from dragon just far and him being the wind at Luffy's back is very poetic I feel. Plus it plays into the whole winds of fate and freedom idea which I think fits Dragon quite nicely. Also if I had to wager a guess he is the one who taught Dragon claw fist to Sabo and that is his personal fighting style of which he is the master of. I imagine Dragon probably knows a little if not all of the Rokushiki considering that again, he's Garp's son and so if the theory is right that he was a marine at one point? Garp likely trained him and if a scrub like Koby knows Rokushiki? I would bet Dragon does too and I would wager he is a master at it greater than Lucci is. \n\nWhen it comes to dragons awakening though, his is much different from Akainu, his wouldn't change the environment but it would give Dragon complete and total control of the weather effectively making him like storm from the X-Men but on a grander scale because dragon would have the ability to turn into wind and if you have seen avatar the last airbender; when used aggressively airbending is DANGEROUS. Hell Kaido showed us repeatedly how powerful wind slashes are so imagine those kinds of attacks but being done by someone with the literally power to control the wind at their will. \n\nThis would act as a good counter to Akainu because the storm would temper the eruptions and cool the lava.\n\n[The winds of Freedom](https://preview.redd.it/4v3zxqdhtnma1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9de6adf9340f3609d711d4ecffbd47f7ef91b9f3)\n\nThen finally we have Sabo and the jury is still out on whether or not he will awaken the Mera-Mera no mi but he if happened DURING the fight with Akainu, I could see that considering the extreme conditions. What would his awakening be? Probably just a limit break on his flames and so instead of normal red and orange flames he can use blue flames and then white flames would be his maximum power which I feel would probably give him a similar appearance to Luffy now that I think about it which is SUCH an Oda move really and truly I do wanna see Sabo and Luffy team up to fight the man that killed Ace but I also feel dragon is set up to fight him so we will see; all I know is? Akainu is SCREWED.\n\n[Emperor Bros](https://preview.redd.it/xm4pa6a7vnma1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=645375c08d1df6245d95f3eff6a310e7a2f4a79b)",

After all, the only person who ever mentioned the Rumble Rumble fruit at all was Robin, maybe the mythical Hito Hito No Mi’s were lost to time and the blank century. Question is how would someone like Enel get his hands on it? Who knows? But I feel like this conversation is worth a shot. What do you guys think?",

Ik that Wano is pretty long but Hopefully i can power through it.

With it's vibrant and colorful setting, the flamboyant characters (which yes I know is part of OP, but still), the story about betrayal, love, drama, revenge, etc, it all just seemed too perfect to not consider. Plus we know Oda lovea to throw in hidden details and Easter eggs.\n\nHere's some links.\n\nKanamaru-za: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konpira_Grand_Theatre#/media/File%3AKyuKonpiraooshibai.jpg\n\nKozuki clan crest: https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Kozuki_Family?file=Kozuki_Family_Portrait.png\n\nPlease let me know what you think.
