        "text": "Thoughts I was having on finishing Einstein’s Gravity at macro.\n\n Distance traveled is equivalent to velocity; DT = V. Just as moving on geodesic lines across the Earths surface gives the illusion of acceleration moving on the curved lines of SpaceTime does as well. This is because not only does Spacetime get bent or curved by matter but it also becomes squished or condensed. This results in more space present than expected along curved lines of Spacetime. How much extra space present along curved Spacetime is directly proportional to how curved the line of Spacetime is(dependent on mass of the gravity producing massive object and how far down a gravity well). As an inertial object moves along a curved Space line more space is present and being passed over than expected. This is what causes the object to appear to accelerate even though there is no force acting on it. The object is not accelerating it’s passing over more space. Ex. If an object is moving at a velocity of 1000m/s in flat space then accelerates to 2000m/s upon moving along curved Spacetime. It can be assumed that the curvature and therefore squishing of space must be causing there to be twice as much space as expected per m. Therefore our object passes over twice as much space per m as in flat space causing it to appear to accelerate to twice the velocity(DT = V).\n\n   Disregard the curvature of Space for a moment. If a massive object is occupying a specific area of space then it will need a velocity of 0 m/s to maintain the same position. Now let’s add the curvature of Spacetime caused by our massive object that would of course be present. We will say the intensity of the curvature is so that there is 1.5(150%) the amount of space present per m than as expected in flat space. Due to the extra space now present our object must accelerate to maintain the same position. \n\nJust some interesting insights I was having. Sorry if it breaks the rules.",

Let me state a few things that I think I've absorbed about it. \n\n* Entangled particles have correlated properties\n* Mathematically they share a wave function\n* You can't describe one without the other(s)\n\nIf these are true, it leads me to a few questions. \n\n1) At what point do we stop talking about two particles and think of them as one? Is that even a useful line of thought to have?\n\n2) Thinking in terms of QFT are entangled particles really just the same ripple in a given field? I know this sounds like the last question but what I'm asking is more like. If stuff is just little waves, are entangled particles two discrete little waves or are they one that looks like two to us?\n\n3) Can I entangle three particles? How do their properties correlate then? If up/down are opposites when two particles are entangled what happens with three? \n\nThanks for reading my post. \n\nBest regards",

Would each beam have low amplitude before and after passing through the target? \n\nIf the beams were focused towards a medium, could one transmit high energy to that one dot while limiting transmission to the rest of the medium?\n\nHow would this compare to a single beam emitting the desired energy to the target but rotating around the medium?\n\n\nEssentially asking if one can use interference of multiple lasers to deliver energy to a specific point in a medium without delivering energy to the rest of the medium, and if not then to what extent it would differ from a single high energy beam rotating around the medium.\n\nThanks guys",

        "text": "The Akashic Records and the Zero Point Energy Field are two concepts that are often associated with spirituality and the nature of reality. The Akashic Records are believed to be a vast, cosmic library of information that contains the records of every soul and event that has ever existed, while the Zero Point Energy Field is a theoretical field of energy that exists at the quantum level and is thought to be the source of all physical matter and energy in the universe. \n\nOne theory that could combine these two concepts is that the Akashic Records are accessed through the Zero Point Energy Field. According to this theory, the Zero Point Energy Field is the medium through which information is transmitted and recorded in the Akashic Records. This would mean that the Akashic Records are not just a repository of information, but are actually an integral part of the fabric of the universe. \n\nIn this theory, the Zero Point Energy Field would be seen as the underlying field of energy that permeates all of reality, connecting everything in the universe. It would be the medium through which all energy and matter are created and sustained, and the source of all information that is stored in the Akashic Records. \n\nAccording to this theory, accessing the Akashic Records would involve tapping into the Zero Point Energy Field through meditation or other spiritual practices. By accessing this field, individuals could gain access to the vast amounts of information contained in the Akashic Records, including information about their past lives, their purpose in life, and their connection to the universe. \n\nOverall, this theory suggests that the Akashic Records and the Zero Point Energy Field are intimately connected and that understanding the nature of one requires an understanding of the other. While this theory is still speculative, it highlights the potential for spiritual and scientific concepts to be integrated and sheds light on the profound interconnectedness of all things in the universe.",

        "text": "I've been in a Wikipedia hole lately and reading about various physicists' life. Who are your favorite physicists and why? Are there any underrated physicists that made significant contributions in your opinion?\n\nSome of the more \"famous\" ones we heard like Einstein, Dirac, Maxwell, or Feynman for instance. I wish I had the chance to learn graduate physics, but Feynman's contributions were very interesting. I always admired Oppenheimer, sucks what happened to him after WWII with his security clearances and politics. He seemed to also made a lot of significant contributions but his mind seemed to be all over the place. I have to appreciate Maxwell's work since I'm kind of working in that (physics -&gt; EE).\n\nBardeen was another interesting and influential person for his work on transistors, and he received two Nobel prizes in physics. I was reading a letter and apparently on his first visit for his prize, the person asked him where his children were, and scolding Bardeen for not bringing them. It was said he responded with, \"I'll make sure to bring them next time\". Looked like he kept his promise for his second award.\n\nThe physicists I'm most curious about is the Soviets. Lev Landau contributions looked very interesting, that I hope to \"pleasure read\" one day. The history of physics is interesting. It seems like mathematicians like Euler, Hilbert, Gauss, Newton laid the foundation. I've heard that when there were times when mathematical theories were stuck, that physics helped break past the barrier and made contributions to mathematics as well.",

That being said I don't quite understand something about gravity. \n\nIf general relativity states that gravity isn't a force and that it simply bends the fabric of spacetime (so planetary orbits are like certain objects traveling perpendicular to a slope but not falling inwards due to inertia), then how are we still attracted to the earth? \n\nIf the earth is causing a divot in the shape of spacetime, then how are still held by it's gravity when we are on it. Does the bend in spacetime reach all the way to it's center of mass? And if gravity isn't a force, how does a spread out volume of debree not that massive on it's own come together and form something with a greater mass? I may be greatly confused and this is a simple answer but my brain doesn't quite understand it. I do tend to overthink so this may be one of those cases. Thank you",

In this case, a spacetime is trivially invariant (a change of coordinates cannot have any physical effect).\nOr is it an active diffeomorphism in which one keeps using the same coordinate system but moves points to new points and then compares the spacetime metric on the old set of points with the spacetime metric on the new set of points? This is the kind of symmetry I mention in my paper. When the authors say \"spacetime without symmetries\", they mean without this latter kind of symmetries.\nFor example, Minkowski (flat) spacetime has Poincaré symmetries of this kind (e.g. it is translation invariant, but also rotation and boost invariant). The curvature at any point of the spacetime is the same.\nNow, imagine bending Minkowski spacetime in an arbitrary way. The result, in general, will not have translation, rotation and boost symmetry, and the curvature at any 2 arbitrary points will be, in general, different.\n\nI was a bit lost in his argument. Can anyone clarify a bit who is right here?",

Whereas I feel like going at 50% speed of light for a longer period of time will bring about more time dilation. Hence the age gap should be wider in Case 2 than in Case 1.   \n\n\nLike how the clocks on artificial satellites needs to be adjusted because of how fast theyre moving at constant speed. However I do understand theyre going around the earth so technically theyre accelerating as well which is why I think I'm wrong.",

        "text": "I'm a physicist and a science journalist. But I’m also a video game fan. Right now, I'm preparing an explanation of the physics hidden on the whiteboards in the Black Mesa game — a fan remake of legendary Half-Life which was blessed by Valve itself. After all, Half-Life is a first-person shooter about physicists and enthusiasts decided to emphasize this by equipping the interiors of laboratories with excerpts from scientific articles on various topics: from gravitation and nuclear physics to superconductivity and nanophotonics. It's very interesting to figure this out.\n\nIn the course of such an analysis I made a small discovery and decided not to leave it for later, when I finish the whole text, but to tell you about it right now. I have [posted](https://nplus1.ru/blog/2023/02/17/ALOL) my discovery originally on russian science news magazine N + 1. Here is an adaptation and a translation of this text for r/Physics.\n\nMy discovery concerns the tau cannon - a fictional weapon with which Gordon Freeman deals. Valve themselves did not really understand its physical basis, so at the early stages of development they considered it to be a railgun. Later it turned into a hand accelerator of the heaviest known leptons - tauons. The mass could explain the piercing ability of the weapon as well as the large recoil although in real life tau leptons live no longer than a picosecond and certainly could not fly anywhere.\n\nYou can find the whiteboard's image via link above. It is the result of AI-upscaling of the original whiteboard made by Steam user Cursed Gman (Dany). After a while developers send me the original images of whiteboards. I'll use them in full text.\n\nSo. From the whiteboard we learn that it is now not a Tau Cannon but an \"Accelerated Lepton Optronic Linearity Cannon\". From the diagram we can see that there is a battery closer to the stock that powers the synchrotron and accelerating coils. What do they accelerate?\n\nIf you look carefully at the formulae at the top, you will see the trace of a theory describing Bremsstrahlung (braking radiation) that occurs when accelerated electrons pass through an atomic cloud. The label \"EM Field Inducer\" next to the barrel with an arrow pointing to an unreadable writings with the word \"bremsstrahlung\" also indicates that electromagnetic radiation is emitted from the cannon.\n\nThis change, by the way, benefited the logic of the weapon. The protagonist finds it in a lab where powerful laser radiation is being studied. An accelerator of tauons or a railgun in this case would indeed have looked less appropriate.",
