This seems like an issue with the social security model, not population growth per se.\n\n\\- I get that a lot of smaller towns and villages are going to disappear, as the few remaining youngsters move to the big city. But this happens all over the world, small towns turn into ghost towns in the face of urbanization.\n\nBut there are other factors that seem important to me:\n\n\\-Japan is a tiny island with a huge population, an it already imports a large percentage of it's food. Having a lower population would make Japan more sustainable and more food secure\n\n\\-The employment percentage for the younger generation has the potential to remain high, even in the face of automation and other technologies. \n\nSo why exactly is this considered a crisis?",

Australia went to metric measurements in +-1973 : kilometres, metres, litres, tonnes, grams etc. So why do we (and other countries that don't use miles any more) still refer to it as mileage and not kilometrage?  Not a very serious question but it's something I think about whenever I update the spreadsheet.",

If you want to breastfeed , what do you feed your baby while you make milk? Does Colostrum come in immediately after a c-section and is this what “you feed the baby “? Can you use a breast pump to pump Colostrum? Or does the hospital give the baby formula or has a stash of formula? Are all mothers “forced” to breast feed in the hospital? What happens if the don’t want to or can’t.",
