        "text": "This is the story of currently three students attending a highschool in Neo Toronto called Bravo Academy, a specially designed facility to help superpowered Novahuman teens control their powers as well as get a good education.\n\n[Previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/8hfrwp/mutants_and_masterminds_3e_bravo_academy_its_a/), students Kayla and Sean spoke to the school principal while Alistair stayed in their dorm to relax from the previous night. While speaking with Golden Conqueror and Principal Langford, Sean and Kayla discuss the events that happened and possible enemies that might want the three dead or hurt. Afterwards, the two head to the danger room to train for the upcoming Powers Display, and while there run into Jonathan, who enlists them in helping him find something spooky happening in the tunnels beneath the school. There, they find one magically inclined student making golems due to a prophecy saying ‘When the sky turns to metal, all will be taken.’\n\nPlayers were awarded one Power Point for their efforts, and at the start of the seventh session, their Hero Points reset to 1 each.\n\n*Thus, we move onto our next adventure:*\n\nWith Alistair’s player back, play begins with him as he dozes off the effects of the night before. It’s in this instance that, while attempting to rest, there’s a knock on the dorm door. Alistair trudges out of bed to find Rachel leaning against the opposite wall. She apologises to a degree and the two converse about what happened with Max, and when Alistair asks what the hell it was that she did, Rachael explains that she isn’t sure, but got herself in trouble back in Ohio and was basically given something akin to a Word of Power. She explains how she remembered what happened during the initiation trial, and considering what happened with Max Predator had put two and two together and come to the conclusion that they also had something to do with Grav Master. She explains that if she had figured it out that quickly, then chances are, the others in the school wouldn’t be far behind, if not already there.\n\nAs a kind of peace offering, Rachael offers one favour to be redeemed in the future, but nothing of *that* variety, an assertion that annoys Alistair, much to Rachael’s delight. As Rachael leaves, the notice screen next to the door pings an alert for Alistair to go to the principal’s office.\n\nAlistair air blasts over to the admin office, and before the door to Langford’s office, he feels a nostalgic wave of dread. Knocking, Langford lets him in.\n\nThe meeting with Dr. Langford followed similar notes as it did with Sean and Kayla, a general overview of the events of the campaign thus far and asking Alistair if he had any ideas on people who might want to hurt or kill him and his friends. He commends Alistair and his friends for upholding one of the core principals of heroism: to use their strength to lift up the weak and defend those who cannot fight back.\n\nLangford even kept a pizza on hand to offer to Alistair later on. When asked if anyone wanted to specifically hurt Alistair, he mentions any enemy of the late Stormfront, his father would be the best place to start. Alistair is a bit befuddled by Langford’s willingness to give Alistair the benefit of the doubt, which Langford says it wouldn’t be fair to blame the students for a psychopath breaking down their wall. When given the opportunity, Alistair asks as many questions about Langford as possible, all of them snake related, to the surprise of no one.\n\nAfter leaving the office, Alistair makes his way back to the dorm, bumping into Sean along the way. They talk briefly where Sean mentions the Powers Display before speeding off. Alistair then suddenly clocks on about the fact that Sean and Kayla were both talking to the principal at the same time, and he makes a b-line for the dorm to find Kayla.\n\nThrough some aggressive interrogation (shouting) Alistair manages to get Kayla to tell him about the display, and lets slip about the adventure with Jonathan. After some tense interrogation, Kayla says that Jonathan is a mage, not a vampire, to which Alistair responds with a form of mild surprise possibly mixed with mild disappointment, though this does nothing to stop him believing Jonathan was Dracula in some capacity. The change in disposition allows for Kayla to flee and head to her after school club, and the brit remains behind in the dorm room.\n\nKayla’s club was the basic self-defence class, and upon arriving at the squash court where it was being held found the other members. One was Peter, the goth kid who was at the sign up table and another goth-like kid named Simon Rothschild (essentially, if Jonathan was a Bram Stoker vampire, Simon would have been an Anne Rice vampire.) Joining them is a short haired young woman with glasses and a very uptight posture, who introduces herself as Tila. Tila is a rather humourless individual, running the group through the basics of what the club would be about before commencing some warm-ups and preparing for the first manoeuvre. Unfortunately for Peter, the swift, disabling strike to the neck had to be demonstrated on him. Suffice to say, it was an intimidating experience for all involved.\n\nSean’s day at work goes fairly smoothly, already proving to be Mama June’s top delivery boy as he races across the city and delivers pizzas miles before the 30 minute limit. It’s during this time he delivers a pizza to a Mr. Sam McMasters, a rather buff looking African-Canadian man who, when Sean catches a glimpse inside the apartment, has a multitude of computer screens and equipment, more so than one person may normally have. Sean makes a note of it for future investigation. Heading back, he has a brief conversation with Martha Mills, the rail gun girl from homeroom who seems to have stopped off in Mama June’s to eat pizza and study. Sean finds out she’s the heiress to a big business in Hollywood. She mentions the library assistant being scary, as well as Alistair being scary, as well as forward with the questions, but Sean explains that he thinks Alistair needs that information to keep as many people safe as he can.\n\nAlistair heads to the Danger Room to do some training, this time not attempting to unlock his power’s limits before Smythe interrupts and lets him know another student would like their turn. Heading out, Alistair spies Roy waiting in the wings. After finishing up a set, he walks out and talks to the rocker, asking if the Powers Display had students fight each other. Roy says yes, much to the brit’s delight. Roy enters into the danger room and unsheathes his guitar. Alistair observes Roy destroy robots through music, but also through brute strength and crushing robots with his guitar. (His guitar, Alistair theorises, is basically like Mjolnir (he is WORTHY of the METAL.)).\n\nLater in the evening, the three relax briefly in the dorm, enjoying a dinner with José and Jonathan who come by for a visit (Jonathan is greeted with a ‘YOU’RE A WIZARD’ by Alistair, naturally). When José mentions the mall trip that weekend, Alistair shrugs it off, much to the chagrin of Sean.\n\nThat night, Alistair leaves his room and heads to the beach, in an attempt to focus and unlock the power he had hidden away for a while. Mechanically speaking, Alistair possesses an Advantage called ‘Holding Back’, which is found in the Teen Heroes supplement for MnM 3e. With it, by passing a will save, spending a hero point and acknowledging that either their party was more than half down or not doing so would cost too many lives, they can work past the mental barriers briefly and, with a certain type of side effect, jump up in power. Specifically speaking, Alistair would jump up from power level 8 to Power Level 12. Typically side effects would be monstrous transformations, falling into a coma or being possessed by something.\n\nWith one suitable roll, Alistair manages to break that barrier, his wind based powers transitioning into full blown lightning, which he demonstrates by launching a blast of electricity into the sky, waking up everyone in the dorms. Unfortunately, he critically fails the following fortitude save, causing the power to overwhelm him and he falls unconscious on the sand.\n\nHe wakes up in the infirmary, where he’s greeted by the sight of the Voltaic Vanguard once again, who, when the others arrive, comes to talk with them about the Powers Display, that three members of the Justiciars would be coming along to act as guests for the event and that the three of them would be having a chat with the players about what had transpired thus far. After a brief chat among the group, Vanguard speeds away to continue her work elsewhere.\n\nWe’ll just have to wait and see what happens next.",

Started about 15 years ago in college when a group of us would get together to play MtG. \n\nThis all happened up in friendly Canada and we had a fella in the group from Mexico City majoring in shivering and wearing two puffy jackets in spring. \n\nWell he had the habit of rethinking and wanting to replay his turns. Stopping play in a big multiplayer game and rewinding other people, sometimes two or three turns after his. Complete with untapping people’s cards for them and putting played cards back into people hands. \n\nHonestly, his personality was so warm and happy that the 8-10 of us let it happen and commented on the fact that we were all taking rides on the Mexican Time Machine. \n\nWe all have went our separate ways, some reconnecting years later, and have been using the phrase in our gaming lives since. \n\nThe highlight came on Saturday when I was browsing board games at my LGS and I overheard a group of teens I had never met use the phrase in a casual game of cards. I and my wife have heard it a few times over the years and we always get excited and share the old memories again. ",

        "text": "The group in question were dealing with a war time scenario where their peaceful nation was getting assaulted from two neighbouring kingdoms, because they wanted that small bit of land, so they could murder each other from it. The party was too low level to actively fight at the time, so they were given escort duty by the captain of the town guard to help get the refugees to safety in the form of a helmsdeep type fortress. There was a set amount of people the party were allowed to take, seventy in all, including the guards.  After setting off, one women rushed up to them with a group of others, this group included children, pregnant women and a man with a fake leg and arm. She begged them to take a few of that group with them. They begged to be let on and go with them, if not together, then at least have a small handful taken along. The party agreed to take the pregnant women and some of the children, but no more. Room was made for them in one of the wagons, with some of the other soldiers walking or going together on horses.  \n\n\nDue to the increased group size, and the already low amount of rations, food was hard to regularly distribute, often leading to missed meals when the party or the soldiers couldn't quickly hunt down additional supplies. Everyone was extremely tired as well, after having moved on without rest for two days in order to avoid getting consumed by the rolling war machines. Sickness was another issue, though the pregnant women held up surprisingly well, better than anyone expected despite being rather late in the cycle. The cleric offered to check on them a few times, but most of them refused and stated that it would do no good to try and deal with it now, though some did consent.  \n\n\nBy the time the caravan had reached the half way point to Sultras bowl \\(the helmsdeep place\\), most of the food was gone and it was redistributed to those who needed it most, the rest having to starve a little more and hunt during the night to keep supplies up and feed themselves. Some disappeared during the night, most likely to try and survive on their own, others did the same but told the group as much to their faces. The young children they had taken were strange, a few were skinny, but others were skinny, yet had distorted bellies. they chalked it up to a disease, and they knew they couldn't do much but help them pass on comfortably. they were moved to the back wagons while the rest plodded on.  \n\n\nA few more days and the party had to pass through a mountain pass to reach Sultras bowl, but the place was prime bandit land this time of the year. Unsurprisingly, the caravan was cornered by a surprisingly large horde of them, not too many to kill off by themselves, but still a large enough number to pose a serious threat. Their leader, a mountain orc, stepped out and greeted them warmly, introducing himself as Bol'ruk peakstepper. They could tell he was some kind of monk or druid, possibly both. He explained to them that normally, they'd simply descend upon the party and kill them all, but since they had been so kind as to keep their delivery in tact, they were willing to let them pass if they handed over the goods. When they asked what he meant, he pointed to the rear caravans.\"Those body packers you've got back there. The stuff in their bellies will pay for your passage.\"  \n\n\nIn short, seven women and five children had been cut open, stuffed with drugs, or small magical items, and then sent to try and get into a refugee train to get to the Sultra crown bandits.  \n\n\n The party, naturally, were shocked by this. But the bard, who was always willing to try and sweeten a deal, asked for some food supplies to compensate them for transporting the 'carriers' all the way. The Bol'ruk agreed, even throwing in one item from any of the carriers guts if they chose one with a magical item inside their stomach. The rest of the party were horrified when he picked the smallest girl, who was promptly gutted, had a sack tugged from her belly, and then healed by a standing cleric of their own. He tossed the bard a ring of the ram before taking the rest of the 'cargo' away, one of the other bandits throwing a large sack of food to the bard as well.  \n\n\nThe bard nearly shifted to chaotic neutral after that, but i gave him props for handling the situation so well. The rest of the group was fucking horrified, but they continued on, got the refugees to the fort, and agreed to never speak of this again. The bard went on to kill far more enemies than he rightfully should have with that ring.",

        "text": "A bit more about the backstory for this game, that I forgot to write in the original.  Mostly because I was writing it during a bout of insomnia, and I may have missed something here and there.  This is set in 1991.  There is no real internet yet.  Computers are still limited to DOS, and the Genesis, as well as Super Nintendo are reigning king of the console market right now, with the Gameboy being the only real option for portable handheld gaming.  So technology is rather limited right now, compared to how far it's come since this.\n\n\nCurrently we're in the first, beginning arc of how this game went.  Keep in mind a lot of the time had me still being confused as to what to roll and do.  So it does get better as we go along.  But right now, all of this can be considered the \"Gotham\" arc, which we went through until we hit Demigod.  Followed by the \"Resurrection Quest\" arc, divided up into \"We have to go where to find more information on this?\", \"We have to meet Hel.  Crap.\",  \"Werewolves and Earlkings and Bats, oh my!\", \"Sneaking through Svartelfheim\", \"We're in the Gulf War in Iraq?!\", \"Egyptian Princess, Sleeping Valkyrie\", and last but not least \"Us vs Svartelfheim, or How a 40 foot tall ice coated Mech is NOT the genius plan we thought it was\".  There's a few more arcs after that, but spoilers.  And really, \"Us vs Svartelfheim\" was probably one of the bigger highlights of the game so far.\n\n\nWhere was I, though.  Ah, yes.  So, last we left off, we'd been working on driving off to merry old Arkham Asylum, to figure out where a relic linked to the Fenris Wolf is at.  And we're interrupted by seeing a Mad Hatter robbing a china shop, and literally stealing all the fine china plates and glasses for something.  Most likely a tea party, if you go by Batman, but so far, it's not quite the same.  It takes a few rolls, but we deal with the disposable mooks pretty easily.  However, that hatter gets away somehow melding into shadows and disappearing.\n\n\nMuch swearing was to be had.  We worked with the police, and with Kieran's GM PC working to help us, we realized we'd have to set up a trap to get him.  So we advertised a first edition \"Alice in Wonderland\" would be shipped to Gotham soon, and set up a trap for the Hatter.  In truth, it was instead a shipping container full of lights that would go on, plus Fenris happily waiting to maul him.  Let me tell you, Kieran was astonished to find that yes, it WAS actually possible to pull off a roll for a 500 pound wolf to hide in a shipping container like that.\n\n\nSo.  We're on the boat, and this Mad Hatter has two giants, dressed as Tweedledee and Tweedledum, break open the shipping container.  We lock him in with Fenris, and take out the two giants before heading in to one of the lights broken, and the Hatter nowhere in sight.  While everyone else is swearing that we lost him, I check to make sure we didn't miss him somehow.  I roll AMAZINGLY well on my perception check, and spot him hiding in the shadows.\n\n\nAlas my rifle shot nearly kills him, leaving us having to roll for medicine to save him.  Which we do, but he's knocked out.  So we're checking his wallet for answers.  The only clue we can find is a shut down Aboretum in Gotham that he has a business card about.  So, we head there, and leave the Mad Hatter guarded by Fenris in our current base of operations.  Who, after we're gone, eats him.  The price of having one of the Fenris Wolf's kids as a friend and ally, I suppose.\n\n\nOnce we're there, I start scouting the place.  The Arboretum is literally covered with sentient plant life, including \"Mokkurkalfi\", or clay golems, covered with vines controlling their every move.  It's pretty much a fortress.  I use the Yata no Kagami to try and look through, and find that Poison Ivy, not that I know it's her, is talking with someone else while working on vials of concoctions of plant life.  We've found a way in through the wall, but we're spotted by those golems.\n\n\nSo, impromptu speech attempt.  Lucas goes up, asking the golems to ask the people inside if we can meet them, wanting to know more about the city and what's going on.  When one returns, we're told \"You're welcome to stay...\" to which Lucas starts thanking them.  \"As fertilizer.\"  Crap.  We manage to make our escape after killing two of them.\n\nI think I'll leave it off here for now.",

        "text": "I had an amazing game of 5e last night and I wanted to share with Reddit. I hope this is the right place, let me know if not please. Also this is going to be long, as our usual four hour session went for six and I'm going to recount a lot of it :D I should mention everyone was level 4\n\nI'm DMing a campaign of 5e, the party is trying to kill a young white dragon named Frostfang for various reasons. The party is Onyx, a Tiefling grave cleric, Cinder, Kobold scout rogue, Aztok, Half-Elf sharpshooter fighter, Granit, Earth Genasi hunter ranger, Cha'a, Lizardfolk warlock of the Raven Queen, and finally Nena, Halfing shepherdess druid and probably my favorite character ever. There's also a DMPC Dragonborn paladin named Randy, who is an idiot. They had ended last session after convincing some dragon cultists to leave peacefully to go get murdered by an angry orc later and after an ambush had taken a cultist prisoner after killing some of his friends and guard drakes patrolling the area. They did not rest after the last session despite my warnings, which will come up in a minute.\n\nThis is where we start the session. After interrogating the dude for a minute, they decide to use the in-universe worship of Aztok and Cha'a, which the party was in the dark about, to convince him to lead them to a chapel where the head of the cult was. They get about five feet out when they run into all the other bodies that they've made and prisoner immediately gets clued in that \"Hey, these guys are not our allies\" and tries to run, gets decked by the paladin and dies. Party moves up to the chapel and starts to investigate it, find out there are two entrances and a belltower on the roof. Party splits into two groups, for the front and rear entrances, and gets ready to enter to surprise the dude inside. Unfortunately, they did not come up with a game plan for when they were going to kick the doors down. Front group(Randy, Cinder, Cha'a, Granit) went in first while I made rear group (Onyx, Nena, Aztok) get delayed a turn until they could hear the fighting inside.\n\nNow, from the last session there was a dude that escaped that the party must've forgotten about, understandable because there's a nasty blizzard out right now that cuts down visibility. So the head of the cult had been talking with a lieutenant via sending stones and was aware of the intruders, and had also summoned some reinforcements, which will pop up in a few rounds. So Randy kicks the door, fails to open it because it is a huge wooden door, and then opens it like he's not stupid and front group walks in. What they see is some 130yo old ass man, and in the pews of this church are 26 Husks, which use the Cultist stat block if you want to look them up. Everyone rolls initiative and we begin. \n\nGranit immediately runs up to the head priest, trying to head him off before he can do much damage, doesn't get all the way to him even with a dash and stop about 15 feet in front of him. The husks move to surround the party, and Cha'a casts the shatter spell, literally killing 9 of the Husks at the start. Good fucking start for the party. Unfortunately this is when things started going wrong, because the weak ass old dude used his +1 glaive to attack Granit, barely meeting her AC and only dealing 1 point of damage, negative STR mod for being ancient as shit. But he's a Death Domain cleric, and so that 1 damage becomes 16  after he burns his channel divinity, and Granit is looking bad off and it surrounded by six husks. Then the evil cleric casts Sanctuary on himself and moves a little further away (he had a 10ft reach with the glaive) and rear group hears Granit yelling and runs in, allowing them to take a turn next round.\n\nCinder is hiding underneath pews and firing off potshots at the Husks, Randy and Cha'a are moping up the survivors of the Shatter, and rear group runs in to see the shit Granit is in. Onyx runs in and uses his channel divinity to curse the evil cleric, giving him vulnerability to the next source of damage he takes, and Nena casts Moonbeam, getting the evil cleric and four of the Husks inside. When it comes back to their turns four more husks are destroyed and the evil cleric takes 22 points of radiant damage after the double, looking really shitty. At this point Cha'a, who has been wearing a cursed glove that actually helps to produce these husks, fails a wisdom save and overpowers Randy, putting an iron mask onto him and putting him into a seizure state. Randy starts to fail death saves even as he still has health due to the nature of the glove and the masks. The evil cleric heals using a 3rd level Cure Wounds, getting most of the HP back and forcing the attacks against him to go wide via Sanctuary while the Husks are doing chip damage. The Ranger goes from 18 to 3 to 18 to 3 like four different times during this fight, and the whole group is predicting a TPK even though everything is under control, they're pretty scared of what the cleric can do (with good fucking reason).\n\nIt's at this point that the reinforcements show up, three guard drakes (one of which is already injured), a homebrew abberation I named a Dracanoid (Stat block at the bottom of the post), and an alchemist artificer who is the lieutenant to the evil cleric. Party, having fought one of the dracanoids before and nearly dying, they really began crapping their pants. Thankfully Nena moves Moonbeam to over the new arrivals, all grouped up near the rear entrance, dealing 10 radiant damage to the drakes, 5 to the artificer, and 20 to the Dracanoid! Cha'a has managed to rip the mask off of Randy at this point as well, and we would normally end here but nobody wanted to leave on this cliffhanger, which made me so proud I won't lie :D\n\nAfter a water break, we jump right back in. Everyone except Cinder has been beaten around at this point, and spell slots are burnt except Randy's. The reinforcements start harrying Aztok and Onyx, while the evil cleric uses his last level 3 spell to cast Spirit Guardians, giving a huge area of denial (trapping the rear party basically) and trapping granit within this. Granit and Nena go down as Spirit Guardians and Alchemical Fire begin doing their work. Party spends some of their actions feeding each other potions while Cha'a, Cinder, and Aztok try to whittle down the group. Cinder actually gets a crit with sneak attack, and finally downs the evil cleric with an awesome headshot with his bow. Granit is healed up by Randy's remaining Lay on Hands, and now that the evil cleric is dead Cha'a uses the glove to try and take control of the Husks, passing a wis save to not try to murder anyone else. \n\nAs the fighting continues, the party is getting closer and closer to a TPK, Granit throws her throwing axe deep into the neck of the Dracanoid, putting it down for good and the party starts to mop up the remaining guard drakes. The artificer runs, followed by Cha'a's Raven familiar and Nena Wild Shaped as a black bear. I believe the final total for the party was:\nAztok: 0 and stable\nOnyx: 4 with no spells left\nGranit: 7 with no spells left\nNena: 12 in bear form, 6 outside. Maybe a spell slot left?\nCinder: sitting at 20ish health, never really got hit\nCha'a: 16 with no spell slots left\nRandy: 26 with some level 1 spells. He's a bad tank\nThanks for reading through all of this! I had such a great time last night I couldn't sleep, I hope this pumps you all up for your own games!\n\nTL;DR - Party nearly died and kicked some ass. The thread is kinda about the details and me gushing about how my party survived so IDK what to say here. I love them?\n\nDracanoid\nCR 4ish\nHP 60\nAC 17\nVulnerability to Radiant\nResistance to nonmagical piercing, bludgeoning, and slashing (I forgot about this!)\nMultiattack: two claws\n+8 to hit, 2d6+6 slashing damage",

        "text": "I had gotten a new group together after the last one split due to others moving away and job stuff, most of them were new to the tabletop scene, but had a solid background in rpgs like planescape torment and the like. There was just one problem, they all assumed D&amp;D was going to be like diablo, all enemies were to be defeated, nothing could challenge them and they were gonna win easily.\n\nHow very wrong they were.\n\nNone of them really respected undead monsters, skeletons in skyrim died easily, zombies were slow and simple to murder, etc. They feared liches, and rightfully so, but everything else they either didn't care about or didn't know. Not to pass up a chance to enlighten them, I made the first mission they ever went on a simple \"Clear the crypt\" affair. A party of one paladin, two clerics and a druid, all of whom worshipped the same god, were given the task by the local church in order to help keep the land safe.  \n\n\nThis was level one, so only skeletons, zombies, weak necromancers and other vermin were on hand for this. It began with them striding through the main iron gate of the cemetery, where they were assaulted by a tutorial fight to help them learn combat, followed up by another just to iron things out. But after that? The fun began. \n\nTo start, the skeletons stood on top of crypts and pelted the party with arrows, which they couldn't properly respond to as ranged weaponry proved ineffective, thus turning a medicore enemy they had just got finished pulping into marrow, into a very lethal threat, just by raising them up ten feet. The paladin was able to smash the crypt and bring the skeletons down into murdering range...But was promptly ambushed by the zombies inside said crypt as well. None of the undead enemies could hit particularly hard, or all that often, but the party learned why undead are feared when left unchecked, their numbers.\n\nAfter nearly being mauled to death, the party regrouped about a mile away from the crypt, rested up, and plowed on once more. They failed to pick up on the hints i dropped about freshly shifted dirt under foot, and the druid was soon being dragged down to the ground by several zombies underneath the earth, who had partial cover due to the ground covering them, but could not move. While that was going on a swarm of rats tried to gnaw the druid to death once he was pulled down, forcing the clerics to wade in with their maces along with the paladin to smash them to bits and rescue their friend. Retreat number 2 happened shortly after.  \n\n\nBy now they were beginning to learn that this wasn't going to be a simple duck in, bash heads in and dash out with loot affair. But old habits die hard and they tried the same tactic one last time when the moon rose in the sky. This time, it was suicide amalgamations. Skeletal heads were loaded with gunpowder before being attached to a pelvis and pair of legs with a fuse coming out of their head. They had 1 hit point each, dealt about 1D8 fire damage and had a blast radius of 10ft. It took one thrown stone from the paladin to teach them two valuable lessons: fire is effective against undead, and don't let them swarm around you.  \n\n\nThey fled one last time, returned to town, did a bit of research, loaded up on AoE tools and entered what i can only call \"paranoid mode\". They walked ten feet apart from each other, all armed with some sort of weapon that had reach, and the clerics were armed with firebombs. The paladin had covered his mace in tar and tarp in order to set it on fire. The most interesting development was the druids tool kit, he had bought a bow and arrow set, but stuck lumps on the heads so it dealt bludgeoning damage instead. They were smart, watching out for disturbed dirt, any bony bodies fully in tact, closed crypt doors, everything and anything. A lot of the cheap tactics i had used before stopped working, thus forcing me to step up my game in the process and really lean on some of the strengths of undead monsters. One encounter in particular saw the party fighting a four armed skeleton with four swords, so he had 4 attacks per round, but could also move at 40ft per round as well. So the group focus fired and turned the final boss into a smouldering crater.\n\nIt might have been harsh to introduce them to d&amp;d like that, though, they were my third longest standing group, and after the day they got thoroughly boned they never underestimated any monster ever again....except for the gelatinous cube. they lost four characters to gelatinous cubes throughout the time we d&amp;d'd together.

        "text": "The early release of Scion Second Edition was recently dropped to the Kickstarter backers after much delay, and the books were a bit of a mess, but the bits that were present were so exciting we had to play a game ASAP. \n\nFor those who don't know, Scion was a hilariously-broken game published by White Wolf and made by Onyx Path. It was about playing as the children of Gods in either modern day or WWII (depending on the game). It was a weird mishmash of taking myths literally and counting all mythologies as true and jury-rigging various myths and legends to fit a game format better. Players start overpowered and the final God-tier of the game barely requires rolling because of how much power you can wield, so we'd usually run it as long long conversations about what happened instead of rolling.\n\nOne major limitation on the first game though was the layout for a character's origins were always pretty slim, almost entirely required to be a human child of a God, as most of the various staple mythological races (Satyrs, Oni, Elves, etc.) had either been corrupted by the Titans or just didn't lend themselves to the mechanical format.\n\nIn second edition, however, they've explicitly thrown most of that out the window for a more narrative-driven, freeform game with tons of options and customizability...the fools don't know what beautiful travesties they've allowed.\n\nThe last game we played for two sessions didn't go too well. I was replaying a character from 1e that basically had been retconned but as super mundane and didn't like it, my friend had her awkward Japanese swordswoman not work out how she'd hoped, and my buddy was loving his marionette-turned-femme fatale character until the last player in our group meta-gamed way too hard and pissed us all off. We decided to start fresh.\n\nEnter my new character, Tlacaelel (\"Cael\" for short) the captain of the [Majestic Montezuma](https://i.imgur.com/QfjIroa.jpg), sky-pirate of the **Topan** (the 13 Heavens of Aztec mythology). He had recently pissed of Tlaloc by raiding his shrine and gained the favour of Chaahk, Tlaloc's Mayan rival. While the two gods battled in a storm over what to do with him, the lightning damaged his ship to the point that he was forced to crash...into a liminal pocket-dimension of forest in North Ontario. He's a Nagual by \"race\", which is a type of magical person able to astral project their spirit in the form of an animal...but only if they get extremely drunk or high first.\n\nThe rest of the party are: Maryam, a let's-player who dabbles in sorcery on the side; William, a large man chosen by a spirit-bear who has a myriad of magic relics; and Riley Bones, the ultimate trap and trapmaster, a hunter who is of dubious gender conformity and is unaware that they are also a changeling of faerie-kind. (Riley as a character is not trans, by the way, and the player was more aping off the anime trope of 'traps' not making any assumptions about trans people.)\n\nThe game started out fairly simple, my entire crew was dead and I was getting drunk on [Pulque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulque) and swooping around as a spirit eagle to make sure nothing snuck up on me in my depressed stupor. The various players converged on my ship's crash site though with Riley being told that there was something afoot in the forest and couldn't help himself from exploring, Maryam hearing about a 'UFO crash' and seeking to investigate, and William in search of an evil within the woods his bear-buddy told him to find.\n\nWilliam met Cael first, and ho boy, did Cael ever think he had crashed in a dump. William was a 6'7\" muscle-bound Englishman in jeans and a bear pelt, with a giant stone hammer on his back...Cael was terrified that he had crashed in some shitty backwater...which, was kind of true.\n\nRiley made a better impression by carrying a rifle, which resembled the turrets on Cael's ship and thus he viewed \"her\" as more civilized and closer to his equal. \n\nMaryam was last to arrive, and was so clumsy everyone who wasn't drunk beyond all redemption saw her coming a while away. She was too interested in the ship for Cael to not be suspicious of her, and he threatened to kill her about three times in the first minute or so of them knowing each other.\n\nWhilst Riley watched Cael belligerently try to keep Maryam from stealing pieces of his broken ship, William called for the [spirits of the forest](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/southpark/images/3/32/HailSatanTransparent.png/revision/latest?cb=20170314050021) to ask if they knew anything of the evil he was sent to dispatch. After many squeaks they said that it was faster than a horse, smarter than it let on, and uglier than anything they had ever seen. \n\nOnce Cael saw the spirits he jumped out of his body and flew over in his spirit-eagle form, and proceeded to cut a deal with a squirrel spirit to watch his ship and let him know if anyone stole from it. He then jumped back in his body and cut a deal with the hairy barbarian man. If he helped William purge the forest of the threat, William would help him find help to repair his ship.\n\nAfter they struck the deal, Riley offered to help protect the ship with a perimeter of traps, which Riley wanted to make anyway. Cael agreed and told Maryam she was free to look around and take pictures (once photographs and smartphones were explained to him) but not to take anything away from the ship. \n\nCael and Will then set into the weirdo forest and following a trail, they came to an old cabin with crunching noises inside. Cael was still drunk so he sat by a tree with his sabre until Will would call for help, and Will snuck in through the front door. None of us were well-versed enough to know what [that weird abomination](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/souleater/images/9/91/Jack_the_Ripper.png/revision/latest?cb=20130116003301) in the cabin was, but it was obviously not something to leave alone.\n\nWill started bapping it with his big ol' hammer and Cael didn't come running in until it jumped on the big guy and stabbed him. Cael stood up, valiantly stumble-ran to the front door, peered in, and stepped no further, preferring to throw his returning kukri rather than get close to that...thing. He missed and combat raged on. There was lots of grappling, reversals, and damage being thrown around, but in the end the monster burst out of the place and darted into the woods. Then fell into a pit trap Riley had dug. After further failing-to-kill-it ensued, it fled once more. Neither of us were fast so away it went.\n\nCael proceeded to loot the now-abandoned shack for food and returned to the ship, getting caught in a sling on the way. Will helped get him down, gather the food, and then prodded his way through the perimeter with a stick, getting through all traps except for a log trap at the end of the perimeter. \n\nAfter a small dinner, Cael invited the others to stay the night so the horror wouldn't get them. Will then communed with the spirits when they other went to sleep and found the monster was darting around near the ship, ready to pounce. Will woke up Cael and the others to notify them...Cael wouldn't let it have his ship.\n\nRiley refused to help due to his exhaustion, so Cael guilt-tripped Maryam into helping him excavate one of his ship's turrets from the ground, and excavate they did. He sat on it through the night and then Riley took over in the morning when he needed a nap, but the monster was smart enough to not try to brave the traps and then assault our position.\n\nInstead, when Cael was awake again and manning the turret, Riley decided to try and flush the monster out, and proceeded into the trap ground while we waited on standby. Riley was great at sneaking...not so much at listening. The monster grabbed him fairly quick and tried to carry him off, but got caught in a sling trap. Maryam then used sorcery to create \"soul-armour\" on Riley to keep him from being torn apart by the flailing monster.\n\nWill called on his bear buddy for assistance and they began trying to pummel the monster off of Riley, but since Riley was there, hurting the monster without hitting our wee-little femboy was tough. Truly what we needed was some kind of precision weapon to get it off.\n\nLike a messy, slow, laser-blasting, automatic, long range Ship Turret!\n\nIt took three combat rounds for Cael to vaporize his way through the trees and bushes to get a clear shot on Riley and the beast, and boy did he. He blasted that stupid bastard so clean Riley didn't take a hit and rangled himself out of the monster's grasp. Which gave a nice opening for Will to smash its head into a blackened, undead shoulder-pancake.\n\nRiley got upset and went to hide in the Captain's quarters, Maryam congratulated herself on helping, and the spirit-bear told Will if he didn't get that stupid fucking airship out of the forest before it and its drunkard owner did more damage then it would demote Will from being its chosen.\n\nAll-in-all I think session one went pretty well.

        "text": "So, I've been lurking here for a while.  It's been pretty fun, honestly, to read some of the stories here.  To be honest, the game I've been playing has been interesting as well, so I thought I'd share.\n\n\nIt all starts March of last year.\n\n\nConsidering I started out as a tabletop gaming newbie, this has become one of my favorite games to date.  Even with the harsh rolls, the irritating rules, and irritation over the epic stats mechanics, my gm has been quite a wonderful one for helping us get used to the system, and get past the Hero system all the way to God.  Add in that he's been willing to house rule neat things, and added some house rules to make fights and the like go faster, it's been actually pretty fun.  \"You're playing as the children of GODS.  Therefore you get to do really neat stuff.\" to quote him on it.\n\n\nMy character: Erik Ulfrsonr/Wolfson, a trapper turned bounty hunter, mostly raised by his mother and a fenrirspawn (as called in the game.  One of the many many descendents of the Fenris Wolf) that he really shouldn't have gotten too close to, by his pantheon's reckoning.  Your average sniper fellow, if raised in the woods.  Found his dead cousin, and his dead cousin's relics in the woods.  At this point, he's still confused as to what the heck killed his cousin, and why it feels so right to wear all that stuff.  A scion of Uller.\n\n\nMy guide: Fenris, a fenrirspawn wolf, descendant of Fenris/Fenrir.  Agreed to guide me, rather than eat me, if I worked towards helping him find a way to see his ancestor, the Fenris Wolf, free.  Won't help me against any of his family, if I'm stuck fighting them, either.  Warns me to be wary of my pantheon quite often, especially that I'll likely to be only approached by them if he's dead.  He did my visitation instead of the Gods, so everything involving me is out of whack.  Also very hard to hide, since even though he's the runt of the litter, he's still a 500 pound wolf.\n\n\nThe other player:  Lucas.  Pretty much a ye old fashioned brawler at this point, armed with a knife.  A scion of someone from the Aztec Pantheon.\n\n\nThe Gm: Kieran.  He's playing with a GM PC because we need all the help we can get, since right now we've only got two people to play, but his isn't introduced at first.  A Scion of Loki, and a spellcaster, he was intended to be a buffing npc.  \"I can't even normally hit the broadside of a barn with this staff!\" was the norm from him, because he didn't really put too much effort in.\n\n\nI was brought in because I'd worked with my GM some time in the past on different things, and had gotten to know him as a friendly guy.  We'd talked about me joining up, but due to health issues, I couldn't join up the prior game they were running before this one.  When we talked about things after most of those health issues had passed, though, he'd offered me a spot for this game, seeing as the other player that often joined in had quit due to work and real life interfering with the time slot they played in.\n\n\nAs the GM describes it: \"We're playing in a similar setup to the batman series with one major detail different.  Instead of Bruce Wayne surviving his parents deaths, he died with them.  So there was never a Batman.  So if you guys want to be a Godly powered superhero, you can.\"\n\n\nI joined in, personally, a couple games after this started.  I'm on the trail of some form of artifact linked to the Fenris Wolf, and investigating the city to see what I can find, when I stumble on the ending of the last battle Lucas had with Kane Taoka, who was apparently blown up as a result?  I still don't have the full details for that.  But Lucas goes back to his apartment, only for it to blow up on him.  Seeing as he survived due to good rolls, he lays low to heal while meeting my character, and my somewhat friendly wolf.  Who may have eaten Kane's heart, and another dead scion's heart in those sewers.\n\n\nI also plundered the Yata no Kagami off of Kane's corpse, not really realizing it was anything useful at the time, and our oh so helpful GM, being a fan of the fate series, classified it as a discus weapon, and based it off of Tammamo's mirror from Fate/Extra.  Plot hook for later, right?  Right.\n\n\nFrom what I understand of things, before his apartment was blown up, he was eyeballed as suspect number 1 as a terrorist, while trying to save a young woman.  Who he had to kidnap to rescue from a cult.\n\n\nSo, as the resident \"friendly\" bounty hunter, I'm helping Lucas, when our GM PC, Kieran, jumps in and offers aid.  We're effectively on that like white on rice, as can be imagined.  We make a deal with the resident semi-friendly mafia boss, Carmine Falcone.  Who he played based off the character from the Gotham series.  Fairly respectful to guests, as long as they don't attack or shoot up his nightclub.  The moment that happens, all bets are off.  We talk a while, and Falcone is convinced to help drop the hit off Lucas if he helps him with a few odd jobs as hired muscle now and again.  After that, the police see Lucas as a relatively decent man.\n\n\nWhile Lucas is helping, and I'm getting roped into helping, Fenris is guarding the girl Lucas saved.  Until Lucas saves a woman named Katherine Kane, and she decides to hire him as her bodyguard.  And follows up by offering to hire myself and Kieran as well.  Unfortunately, the details for that escapes me a bit, I was still getting used to the system, and I had to look her up by picture to even remember anything about her.  Redheads and gotham city does not easily give you results when you've only seen a single picture, and that art style isn't used anymore.\n\n\nI digress, though.  3 2 hour games in, and we decide to see if Arkham Asylum might be holding the relic we're looking for.  So we all get into the van, and drive off, only to spot a robbery in progress by the Mad Hatter.  I think I'll leave the details for that off until I write about the next few batches of games, though.  Well, if there's any interest, anyways.",

        "text": "Sometimes people have to drop in and out of groups due to life, which is perfectly understandable. I usually take this into account and try to give their characters a good send\\-off before they leave if they give notice. Replacing said person can be a task, especially when everyone else at the table has an entirely different playstyle to the new guy.\n\nWe were in the middle of a rather moody campaign set on a planet near the centre of the universe, it was one of the few planets there that had managed to thrive and prosper where other planets had died and been reduced to dust. It was populated entirely by elves and the party were made up off representatives from various fantasy space empires and religions, it was all very social, and most combat encounters took place in duels, tournaments or assassination attempts, no big sprawling battles this time around.\n\nThe guy who had left the group because of life had been the parties tour guide for the planet, the rest of the group were well connected enough now that they could shift around with relative ease, but he was sorely missed. The replacement dude, who seemed nice enough, if a bit on edge most of the time, showed up on the night with a few character sheets. I had given him a decent rundown of the campaign prior to this...And he showed up with two barbarians with low mental stats, and a chaotic evil necromancer. I rolled with one of the barbarians, the one with the chaotic good alignment, but i honestly think he made the other two worse just so he could get that one due to the fact it was pretty unbalanced.  \n\n\nI introduced his character to the group in a courtly fashion. They met up at the sundance festival where all manner of nobility were set to discuss all manner of things. In came a seven foot tall mongol style orc in armour, wielding a great axe and smelling of shit, he was apparently a ranking officer within the empire of the space orc khans. The rest of the party got to know him, though he was a bit turse and stand\\-offish, he also took offense to anything anyone said that might be mildly hostile. \n\nThis all came to a head when the rest of the group split up to talk to various nobility, trying to pry open the current plot that they had discovered some time ago involving a party of isolationists who wanted nothing to do with the outside world. He yelled, out of character, \"What are you fucking idiots doing?! you never split the party!\" we calmly explained to him that in all the places they were likely to be attacked, in the middle of a ballroom with dozens of guards, spellcasters and lethally trained noblemen of varying political parties, this was low on the list. This just made him more nervous than before, but he tried to talk to a noblewomen, well, girl, she was about 14 and a gnome, she came with her father.   \n\n\n\"I roll to grapple her throat.\" what? \"I roll to grapple her throat so i can choke her out. it's part of my characters background, he hates gnomes.\" I let him roll, and of course he makes it, he's a walking tower of meat. he also rolls for stealth to see if he can choke her and get away with it...fucking nat 20. so we all have to IC ignore him murdering a child before he stuffs her body underneath a table cloth. Before One of the other players can object to this, he then says \"i pull the body out from under the cloth after pretending to look under there and yell 'we have a murderer on the loose, someone just killed this child!'\" \n\nAt that point, two options rolled into my mind. The first being i just murder this guy's character for being such a colossal ass hat on day one for ruining everyone elses fun. Or i stick to my guns and let him try to pull it off. In the end, i tell the other players to quiet down and tell him to make a bluff check, he says he shouldn't because no one should be able to tell he's lying. I slam my hand down on the table and tell him to make the damn roll, It's not bad, 15 overall. Only 15&amp;#37; of the people in the room are convinced, since everyone in there has fucking amazing sense motive rolls. Some people run in panic regardless, but the overwhelming majority produce weaponry or ready spells and attack him.   \n\n\nThis, is what he had wanted. He dropped the girls corpse, readied his axe and waded into combat...Too bad he only got about two rounds worth of combat before being reduced to a withered corpse by several death spells and a soul gem spell that sealed him away forever.  \n\n\nThe player then got real pissy about it, saying that wasn't fair at all, that i was a biased, shitty DM. I just told him to leave before i smashed his face on my table for murdering a child in game and acting like a total dick ever since he got to the session. The fucker tried to flip the fucking game table and made a run for it, trying to take some of my rpg books with him as he went. We managed to stop him from taking everything, but he left with my copy of Midnight \\(really fucking good rpg system\\).   \n\n\nIn the end I got it back after the guy who suggested bringing him in went over and snatched it back, but we didn't try to replace our missing forth member for a while and I just made a DM PC to fill in the roll. I hate making DM PC's who have to get involved in everything, but it was better than the alternative.",

        "text": "One day while the party was heading through a town on the way to the big city, there was a festival celebrating the towns founding for the 50th time, there were games everywhere, all kinds of food, and competitions of speed smithing and weapon mastery.   \n\n\nNaturally, the party was hesitant to split up, especially after a harsh lesson learned in a prior dungeon against some tentacle beasts, but one by one they peeled off after they figured out everyone in the town wasn't a horrifying cthuloid abomination in disguise. The fighter went off to the wrestling pits, stripped off his armour and joined the tournament, flexing his big muscles and earning a hefty second place pot for his troubles, and a low level magic items to boot. The paladin engaged in a poetry battle against a bard, using a combination of diplomacy and his points in choir singing to bring the audience to tears of joy. The dwarven alchemist joined in on the smithing tournament, cheating a little by treating his blades with alchemical stuff, but he still came out in first with a rather powerful masterwork flamberg.  \n\n\nThen we come to the rogue. He broke off on his own and started to circle the place, picking a few pockets at first, getting away with it easily enough, but as noon came around he got a bit peckish, and thus tried to steal a pie from one of the stands. Nat 1. The shopkeeper tried to get him to pay, but instead of taking the easy way out and setting it down, or coughing up the five copper needed, he lept over the stand, put a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her if anyone called the guard...the guard were ten feet away. He kept the women in front of him, slowly dragging her backwards and into the bakery before bolting and slamming the door. The baker was tied up and left in a corner while he tried to find an escape rout. Meanwhile the guards were surrounding the house, demanding he opened the door and surrendered.  \n\n\nTo everyones surprise, he thought it would be a smart idea to set the building on fire with the women in it, use the smoke to mask his escape from the roof, and then run from rooftop to rooftop in order to reach the town's outskirts. That is what would have happened if he didn't fall to the ground on the first jump, breaking a shit ton of bones because he failed the reflex save. He was surrounded by five guards now, with no way to escape, and the rest of the party were only just now getting near to the scene. When they refused to help him, he commited suicide right there and then by stabbing himself in the eyes with knives. He blinded himself, but didn't do enough damage to kill himself, even with sneak attack damage on top. The guards were shocked and didn't attack that round, so he had one final chance to surrender, plead insanity, anything. But instead he decided to drink a vial of acid to end it all, refusing to go to jail.  \n\n\nLet me remind you, this was all over a five copper pie.  \n",

        "text": "Is it worth trying to delay the end of a dying, miserable world? That was the question I wanted to pose to my players during this campaign.\n\nThe party were doing a long form escort mission, taking an NPC priestess girl across the entire planet, bouncing between temples in order for her to slowly boost the power of her soul so she could do a ritual to revitalize the planets dying sun for a few years by casing an extremely powerful deity level wish spell which would kill her upon casting. Unfortunately for them, some people had other ideas, some better, some worse, mostly worse.\n\nThe party set off in good spirits, leaving the grand temple which the girl had been housed in, along with a small caravan of NPC's with a stock of supplies. The players also decided to hire on some additional mercs in order to sure up their protection. They didn't have enough money to pay all the mercs at first, but they knew they'd be encountering bandits and the like, so loot was not a major issue. The biggest problem they faced was actually the environments. Each part of the planet had at one point been something other than a fetid wasteland, but because of the impending death of the star and the increased size and heat output the star had, everywhere was more or less a depressing shit hole. Food was usually a big problem, with the main source of food for days being goodberries made by the parties druid.\n\nThe priestess girl, called Olga, usually tried to help out where she could, talking to everyone in turn, including the hired mercs. She was actually five levels higher than the rest of the party, but her spell selection was so specialized she was virtually worthless in combat outside of healing and environment manipulation. The party did pretty much the same thing, save for the parties leader, a gruff paladin of pelor. He didn't really get on with anyone, except a merc called Sisisfo Darari. Turns out they both came from the same ruined kingdom that had finally passed into history a decade ago. The two would usually share drinks and stuff.\n\nThe campaign was split up as trips between temples, each temple visited would increase Olgas level by one, with the goal to get her from level ten to level twenty. Each trip had one of the enemy factions attacking before being promptly defeated in some manner by the heroes, with the first few being barely more than cartoonish caricatures. During that time the party was given a bit of room for error, so they could figure out how to best keep the caravan going. Things truly began after temple three.\n\nOn the night of celebration after Olga leveling up, She asked each party member in turn what they thought was best for the world, in regards to the use of her wish spell. The paladin, Vasmus, said that it would be better if they could find some way to restore the sun to a nubile state, rather than simply push it back a few years at a time. The druid, Horuss, suggested it might be better if the wish was used to make all life on the planet more tolerant to the heat. The Rogue, Del, didn't care, he just wanted to get off this planet as there was nothing worth saving there. Lastly, Onizuka, a samurai styled fighter, said it was his duty to see Olga finished her pilgrimage, and it didn't matter what he believed. They then asked her, and all she could say was \"I don't know.\" I made careful notes of what they all said.\n\nThe next faction they went up against were the Ebeon, a new nation of genetically mutated humans who's skin pigmentation was so black that they looked like walking pillars of obsidian. Most of the party characters had dark skin, but none of them were that black. These people could walk out in the sunlight without getting badly burned, and had slowly constructed their own small nation along the path the caravan was going. The ebeon were no smarter or stronger than them, nor were they innately evil, they were just humans of differing skin colour who happened to flourish in the new climate. There was only one combat encounter throughout that trip, and, funnily enough, it was started by the party. Del, as it turned out, was a horrible racist, the player wasn't, but his character sure was. He got into a massive bar fight over making hostile comments to the bartender who eventually reached over and smashed his face in. This led to a discussion of race, and whether any one species had a right to the planet more than any other, and if the majority of the human population would be better off dying or moving on to allow the ebeon to live on their own on a planet they'd flourish on. They got an Ebeon to join them as well, a young lad called tunguska, he acted as a guide through the saltflats.\n\nAfter they got past the following temple, they had to deal with the Salamon, racial purists who believed that anything that deviated from the human form was heretical flesh and must be purged. They believed the world should in fact burn, but only to get rid of the 'diseases' of the gene pool. They fought with fire spells mostly, even had flame throwers and a feral dragon. Each and every fight was hard won, with Del having to confront what was effectively a manifestation of his own racial tensions, while also protecting and getting saved by tunguska. The party got their hands on some really sweet fireproof gear, including much better caravans after all was said and done, but at the cost of some close friends who burned in the fires.\n\nThey didn't have much of a chance to rest after finishing the 5th temple, as they got attacked in the night, with several people being taken off into the darkness, Olga not included. Del was the only one to wake up in time to try and stop them, but when the rest of the party got to him, he was already dead, having fended off five attackers, the sixth killing him just as his newfound friend tunguska tried to help. Tunguska became that players new character, which seemed fitting. This group were the Nightkin, those who wished to see the sun removed entirely. The party elected to not save those who had been taken, even though some of them were semi valuable, it wasn't worth the risk to the overall mission, and so they plowed on, changing their course entirely to throw off the nightkin who now knew the original route.  \n\n\nA few more temples later, having dealt with factions who posed similar ideological oppositions \\(some far less valid than the others\\), they got to the final two. It was on the one year anniversary of the pilgrimage that Olga finally asked the party what they thought was right, what should be done with the wish, what should happen to the world. Tunguska said that he wanted everyone to thrive and be happy, but didn't know if that was still possible on this planet, or if any other world would accept his people. Onizuka gave the same response as before, but not without a long pause, as he had seen all the differing ideals of the people they fought. Horuss was convinced that they could make the rest of the world be able to bare the harshness of the sun in a similar way to the ebeon, but stopped when he realized that would mean drastically altering the biology of millions without their consent. Vasmus was beginning to think the sun was a lost cause, stating as much, and that this pilgrimage would hopefully give people enough time to figure out a better solution. Olga...Said she wondered if it would be better for the world to die, and for her wish to be used for something else, but not what. They went to bed that night, and awoke to find Olga missing. As was sisisfo darari.\n\nOne of the factions who wanted to stop the ritual were the Voice of Null, a collection of philosophers who believed that they should let the world end, because if they did, no new souls would be born on this planet, thus sparing future generations from suffering and allowing their souls to pass on into different worlds where they could live in prosperity. They wanted the priestess to use her wish powers to teleport every living thing on the planet to a different world, or better yet, to Sigil, the hub world of existence, so everyone could split off to the worlds they wanted to go to and be happy. The main individual of this group was the antagonistic bard in question, Sisisfo Darari, The prince of a now dead desert kingdom that had been scorched away by the sun.   \n\n\nThe party never kept an eye on what she said or who she spoke to during the trip, and Sisisfo had been talking to her a lot throughout the trip, slowly bringing her to his way of thinking. But the party, unaware of this, set out to find any signs of her and sisisfo. To cut a long story short, they caught up with them at the next temple, where several magi, sisisfo and olga were preparing to move on to the final temple and make the wish.\n\nTunguska tried to appeal to Olga's heart by professing something he had kept secret for a very long time, his love for her. If she used the wish, she would die, and not only that, her soul would be destroyed, ridding her from even the afterlife. But it changed nothing, even though she returned the feeling, she wanted a better world for everyone, even if that meant sacrificing herself, and the planet they were currently on. Onizuka, bound by his oath, could not let her go through with this and would rather see her dead than betray her nation. Vasmus and horuss though? They walked to the other side, agreeing with the philosophy of the Voice of Null, even Vasmus's god pelor had spoken to him and told him that he would support whatever choice he made. Tunguska and Onizuka stood side by side in shock and awe as the party split.  \n\n\nSisisfo offered the same choice to the rest of the caravan, no blood needed to be spilled, not until everyone had made up their minds. Most of the caravan also sided with the voice of null and, more importantly to some of them, Olga. Onizuka declared that he wanted a duel, to decide this properly, and to his credit, he had a right to one. But unfortunately, Vasmus was the one to take him up on the fight, even if sisisfo was prepared to give him satisfaction.  \n\n\nVasmus was a special kind of paladin to, having eschewed spellcasting in favour of having more feats, so even if he couldn't use his smite ability on onizuka, he had feats which allowed him to effectively recreate the same damage output as a low smite attack. Things like power attack with his spiked mace. The fight lasted about half an hour out of game, with most of it devoted to debating between two clashing ideals. It was brutal, as both of them were big strength based melee fighters who hit like trucks, but were decked out in specialized full\\-plate. But only one could win, and Vasmus proved to be too much of a damage sponge for Onizuka's magical gear to kick in, like a sword that deals more damage if the opponent is below half health.\n\nOnizuka was sliced clean in two at the waist, his final words were \"Don't bring me back, let me die doing my duty.\" Tunguska and a few other NPC's were left. After seeing what happened to onizuka, a man tunguska respected, his heart was broken and he turned away, intending to walk back to his people, even though he knew he wouldn't make it before the wish spell was used. One by one the other NPC's followed. Making the trip to the final temple was as simple as casting a few teleport spells to get everyone to the capital city.  \n\n\nI had originally planned to make the final temple a hurdle in of itself if the players had all decided to join the voice of null, or one big bittersweet homecoming if they stuck to their original goal. But since there was only two of the original four left, i sped things up by having them teleport right into the central chamber where olga performed the rite one final time. After that, she said goodbye to sisisfo, thanking him for opening her eyes, then to the others for keeping her safe and supporting her choice. The world went gray, all the colour and energy of their surroundings seemed to be sucked into a single point, focusing on the tip of olgas tongue. She felt it, that simple, powerful phrase, two little words, \"I wish.\"  \n\n\nThe planet was barren ten seconds later, not a single living thing walked its surface, everything had been warped to a new land, a new world circling a beautiful blue star. Olga however, had remained behind on that dying world, so it could serve as her tombstone. In ten years time, the sun would eventually go supernova, blowing it and everything else around it to pieces before being reduced to a smouldering ball, a neutron star. ",

See, I was a noob at DnD so we started a smaller 1 player game. My goal was to clear a dungeon filled with creatures invading a guys farm. So, I walk in and decide to look around. I find a secret door and decide to walk through. Suddenly, I am attacked by two rat things I forget the name of. I take one of them down easily but with the second...I get the thing I call the curse of the 2's. Every single time I wanted to kill the fucker, I always rolled a 2. I just ended up calling it \"the fucker\". Finally, after getting it away from me when it ripped through my shoulder, I ended up slicing it in half. After that ordeal and loosing 30 health to a rat, I decided to keep going down the secret area. After being dumb for a bit and trying different doors. I get snuck up on by a skeleton. After a bit of a fight, I rip it's arm off and hit it with it saying \"Stop hitting yourself\" multiple times. Finally after that encounter, I head down more doors, suddenly getting attacked by a dog of some kind. I hit it with my arrow in the nose. and it rushed me, I decided to be clever and push the arrow in its brain. Sadly, when I did, It didn't kill him fully. I decide to finish him with a battle axe but the curse of the twos, it fell from my hand, letting the dog attack me, taking another bunch of health. After I stabbed the F, er in the brain and it fell off. I finally got out of there, losing over 100 health to a rat, a skeleton and a dog. ",

        "text": "When it comes to homebrew gods, I let my players have a little input into their creation, not a massive amount, because I like to make deity worship have some negatives as well as positives, something the players don't want. But almost every god in d&amp;d and pathfinder has drawbacks to worshipping them. Anyway, I usually allow them to pick a single domain for them, and if they feel up to it, specify a single aspect of the deity.\n\nThis is the religion of Nicolai, god of passion, insanity, souls, fire and...bees. His titles included, the march hare, the wicken man, the two faced inspiration and the spectral flame. He usually appears as a tattered bunny rabbit, a burnt man, or Nick cage himself dressed like a christian priest.\n\nNaturally, after I was done making this, I showed it to my players as a joke, since I was gonna rewrite it a little to make it less bizzare. One of them immediately rewrote her cleric to be a worshipper of Nicolai, made her the same alignment as her god \\(chaotic neutral\\) and slapped it down on the table for approval. I shit you not, she pulled this off in under a minute, backstory rewrite and all.\n\nThis wont be so much a story, as it will be a list of events regarding nanali Travolta and her bizzare nick cage worship.\n\nHer idea of prayer to the wicken man was to take a toy rabbit made of non flammable materials, stick it in a box, set it on fire, then recite modified quotes and weird chants. She was kind enough to email the whole chant to me. \"The bunny is back within its wooden box, not a shark or a snake or a iguana, a bunny. The blaze shall help it find individuality and set it free. Its ashes shall be perfect, as are the stars. But not I! Not anyone! We are flawed and wrong, we are here to be broken and ruined. So that we may be reshaped into something better, so our soul may dance...so our souls may dance.\" In case you couldn't tell, she really liked nick cage movies.\n\nOne day when they were trying to get information out of a slaver who worked for that quests big bad, she tied him up on a pyre, had several buckets of water around and made sure the druid was kept close by but couldn't see or hear what was happening \\(cos the druid knew control water\\). She then set the pyre on fire while she stood on a stone outcropping nearby, talking to him as the fires slowly licked at his boots, yelling questions at him and threats. the most memorable being \"Tell me you dirtbag, where are the little baby honeys!? I will swallow your soul!\" When that got the info she wanted, the druid was called in and the fire was put out, before the guy was gagged, blindfolded and kicked in the direction of town.\n\nThe next torture scene involved bees, flaming bees, because she wanted the summon swarm spell, but to have it be a bit more effective. And what better way to torture a nobleman who had been selling children to a dark god cult than stripping him down to his undies, putting him on a \"wooden horse\", and let him get covered in burn marks and stings?\n\nShe also took the animate dead spell at one point, and with my blessing, made a group of flaming skeletons whom she donned in magical leather armour before sending them out to track down specific criminals within the city that the city watch had listed within their bounty records. she made undead flaming bounty hunters.\n\nAt one point when she was tasked by nicolai to hunt down a heretic, her first response was \"I shall shove him up satans butthole for my lord.\"\n\nWhen they finally caught the ringleader for the slave trade, told him what his subordinates had been doing, and mentioned that his family was still alive, she did something rather sweet...if somewhat creepy. It turned out he had never wanted to sell children, nor did he know about the nobleman selling them to an evil cult, or anything like that. He was lawful evil, but as evil as others. In the end, she convinced the rest of the group to let him go free, on the condition that he faked his own death and went back to his family, never to take up criminal work ever again. He agreed, and they burned one of his friends bodies so black that no one could recognize the remains and would have to take the heroes words, smashing the skull for good measure. Every now and then she'd check in on him, make sure he was redeemed.\n\nDuring a big fight against a summoned herald of the demon lord of rape, socothbenoth, divine intervention was invoked. Now, this spell has a really low chance to work, even at the max chance it's a 1 in 4. So whenever used, I like to make it more powerful than a wish spell, but it's effects are very localized. So when it worked, Nick cage fired out thousands upon thousands of chains, all coiling in blue and pink fire, lashing around the demon lord, burning away at his flesh and bones, slowly being dragged down into the open maw of the cage, swallowed and taken away into another plane entirely.\n\nThe final big note would be how her character retired. The player wanted to try something else, but loved the character so much she wanted a fitting ending. So Nanali eventually settled down herself and became an artist, marrying a bee keeper NPC whom the party had known for a while, eventually having kids, three of them, two boys and a girl. The first was called roger, the second she considered calling roger as well, but two rogers wouldn't make a right, so he was called John, the girl was called Mindy, but everyone called her baby girl, especially her father, Damon Macready.",

        "text": "A little bit of an intro. I had an idea for a character that was an assassin droid that prefers to kill with his fist. He is in a 3PO chasis, is bloodthirsty and is kind of a dick in conversation. So the complete oppasite of C3PO. The DM was on board and we modified the droid race a bit so that I'd have the brawn characteristic instead of the normal droid perk that replaced it. The DM wanted everyones background to be a secret. The other characters are a Human Gambler and a Klatoonian Marksman. Now we can begin our story.\n\nThe game starts with the gambler and the Droid in a speeder moving across the desert to a slave trade. They arrive and there are four guards and 3 slaves. One is a Weequay who doesn't speak basic, the next is a rather rude human and the last is our soon to be Klatoonian party member. The gambler questions each one asking about their background and skills. The only one with any promise is the Klatoonian. The conversation moves on to prices for the slaves. The conversation eventually takes a sour turn and the slavers draw their weapons on us. The gambler tries talking them down but that only pisses them off more. \n\nThen the slaves turn on their former masters. The Klatoonian managing to grab ones carbine. The gambler finishes the first slaver. The Droid takes off screaming as loud as his vocabulator will go, \"Dont shoot! I am only a protocol droid!\" The slavers ignore the droid who ran off to their left and focused on their two assailants in front of them. The fight goes on with the Klatoonian getting hit once and no one else taking damage. The Droid walks up behind the rear most slaver who is taking cover behind his speeder. He didnt even notice the red metal hand karate chop his skull in half instantly killing him. Now the other two players are dying in laughter because they thought it was an insane fluke of a hit from their protocol droid. \n\nThe fight continues with one of the slavers getting hit and the other two party members taking cover behind speeder the Gambler and Droid arrived in. The slavers didnt notice their friend get karate chopped into the shadow realm. So the droid waddles up behind his second victim who notices him this time but its to late as the Droid punches through the slaver's chest. The team is now in awe that their droid is on a murderous rampage. The last slaver notices that both his friends are down but couldn't put together that the protocol droid had done the dirty work. The fire fight continues with the slaver getting hit again and no one else. The droid slowly makes his way behind the last slaver and unleashes a punch into his back. But the punch didnt connect well and merely broke some ribs and dislocated his shoulder. The Klatoonian finishes him off with a well placed chest shot. \n\nBefore the two others could ask the droid what the hell is up with him. Blaster fire rains from above blowing up all the speeders and knocking everyone to the ground. A medium sized ship lands and out walks a well equipped bounty hunter. The bounty hunter takes the incapacitated team aboard and locks them in his brig. Except the droid who is deactivated and put in the storage closet. That was just the beginning combat. I have more zanny RE-SE antics if you're all interested.",

Our introduction began with me punching “batman” in the gut and saying “Now we’re even.” Of course, with his magic power of being paranoid, he had managed to set protocols to control all my tech \\[:\\(\\] Turns out I was being robbed by Scarlet Witch for absolutely no reason whatsoever.\n\n\\(Actually, his character wanted to investigate my house to team up with or fight us, but got caught when she tried to use my technologically advanced coffee machine.\\)\n\nBefore heading back, I proceeded to non canon nuke my house a few times, and was given a few facepalms by the rest of the surprising group.\n\nSo we went over there, and with some reasoning I can’t recall, we decided to set a truce in place. Instantaneously, a robot about the size of my Iron Man MK II suit broke in \\(third time now\\) and began to wreck the place. We took it out pretty easy. Then I decided to look at the tech. Hammer tech.\n\nMy idea of what I was told:\n\n“Nolol hammer lame boi we go find who made big ugly metal toy.”\n\nWhat I was actually told:\n\n“Hammer’s really too stupid to make something as good as this, though it’s pathetic.”\n\nWe investigated, and here’s an interesting piece of it. The end results were the following:\n\n* I lost a small fraction of my bank account.\n* I blew a hole in a building.\n* We got lightsabers \\&gt;:D\n* I made the Mark III armor, added stealth, and made Jarvis more than a simple Siri with more lines of code.\n\nSo I decided to raid Lexcorp, because I didn’t think the other options of rich inventing billionaires were likely. They were as follows:\n\n* Reed Richards \\(Nolol\\)\n* Me \\(Cmon really\\)\n* Victor Von Doom\n* Oliver Queen\n* Hank Pym\n* Magneto\n* And I can’t seem to remember any more.\n\nVictor Von Doom was in a different country, so I figured it’d be easier to check out Lexcorp \\(We’re in New York.\\)\n\nWe raided Lexcorp. It was great. Because of all the property damage, good ol Batboy took out money to pay “Innocent Lex.” \\(GG u/TheThinkermissesHR\\) \\(Batman’s note, written by Batman: He actually was innocent. He metagamed to think he was a villain because of his name, broke into his office and destroyed his property after assaulting some guards. Of course I had to give him a check. From Stark’s bank account. BECAUSE I’M BATMAN!!!\\) Right before that, though, there was a laser cage, of which he destroyed and turned into a primitive lightsaber. Still gotta make armor out of that. After some time, I was given the news of who had actually sent the robot. It was doom, who had wanted to bring us together to help us get the “Finite stones.” According to him, there was a purple alien coming to the planet to get the stones to defeat his rival Darkseid, who was in eternal conflict with Thanos over who was better and who had copied who. Being the intelligent person I was, I decided to plan ahead in case he **was** real. Both Batman and Scarlet Witch didn’t think it was true.\n\nDon’t take a risk kthx.\n\nI’m going to end this one right here, mainly because it’s taken forever. I’ll post the next entry to this tomorrow. By the way, this is my first post. I hope you enjoyed it. Feedback would be appreciated.",

        "text": "The hardest encounters i've thrown at players are usually some big bad guy, as i have a love of boss battles. Every now and then the players might find themselves running head first into something that is supposedly trivial, but through their own idiocy they make it a two hour problem solving conundrum.\n\nThey were sent off to collect some medicine from an alchemist hermit who lived happily in the mountains, living off of the money he got from his clients. But the party had to kill him due to a plague, the cure of which he had not been able to consume before it progressed too far, so he left the medicine to ferment inside a thick chest, wiped his memory of it, and then hid the key. The chest was easy enough to find, tucked within the lab, behind a false wall panel. Their goal was simple, open the box without breaking the lock.\n\nThey couldn't risk breaking it open, otherwise it might ruin the medicine. They couldn't use acid either, or explosives, but pretty much everything else was on the table. At first they thought of getting their hands on the key, which was discovered to be tucked away inside a rack of drugs. But since the barbarian was the one to find it, he thought it would be fine if he took one of the bottles and downed it for the lols...He took an entire bottle's worth of heart medication, the kind of stuff that's supposed to help it beat stronger. I rolled on a table to get this result. He had to make several constitution saves or have his heart literally explode inside his chest, and while this was happening, he crushed the key in his hand.\n\nSo now they were down one key, and the barb was having a seizure. While the cleric worked to heal him and stop him from exploding into a gore fountain, the rogue tried picking the lock, I gave him three shots, all of which he failed. Now the lock was jammed and nothing could get it open smoothly. The wizard decided to give it a try by casting wood to stone, which worked, but that only made the box heavier. His reasoning led him to try and slowly chip away at it with a hammer and chisel, but the rest of the group stopped him before he continued because i was about to say \"make a roll\". So instead he wondered if it would be possible to pry the lid open with the flat of a blade or something and bust the lock, the rogue tried it with a knife...and the knife snapped in half. The stone transformation had made it much sturdier than before, so the DC was now higher. After this failed, they spent some time sitting around discussing ideas, like shrinking down a category tiny creature and putting the now super small thing through the lock hole, or my personal favourite, summoning a demon, making a pact with it, and selling the demon something of value in exchange for cracking the lock open and getting the medicine out safely.\n\nThe wizard then got bored and looked around for the alchemists spell book in the hopes that he had a \"stone to flesh\" spell in there. The cleric then took a shot at it by repeatedly taking a wetstone to the box, attempting to wear it down at the hinges enough to detatch the lid. He pulled it off, partly. The lock still kept it in place. They considered prying it open again, but didn't want to risk breaking the medicine container. The wizard came back with the spellbook, and sat down with it, intending to copy the stone to flesh spell into his own book carefully. This would take him about seven hours to do, followed up by an additional eight to sleep on so he could memorize it, so the rest of the party had time to try other ideas.  \n\n\nThe next attempt was quite simply to recreate the medicine from the notes the alchemist left behind. They got the notes together, but since the mage was the only one who had high enough lore to decypher them, and he was busy, they couldn't try it, and even if they did, they'd later learn it took three days for the medicine to be properly prepared, with an extra two for fermenting. So they returned to the box and had the parties druid try to use shapeshift to get through the crack they made, take the medicine, then leave. Since the druid didn't know stoneshape, this was all he could really be good for at the moment, and thus he tried, shifting into a stag beetle. He got inside, and saw the pouch the medicine was in, but he couldn't drag it out because he got stuck in the crack, failing his acrobatics check. \n\nIt was about then we all were getting frustrated by this, so when the druid expanded back into his normal shape, he destroyed the box, and the medicine was in the pile. It turned out to be a bunch of sturdy capsules, something that wouldn't have broken apart if they had been a bit rough with the chest in the first place.\n\nThen, like a dumbass, to top this all off, the barbarian ate one of them, failed a constitution save not to overdose on drugs again, and promptly died of a heart attack. The cleric revived him, but only after they had gotten out of the lab so he couldn't chug anymore drugs.",

        "text": "Intelligent items are always fun, sometimes they are silly, like willy the rod of wonder, but no item caused more problems than a simple scimitar called \"Dunewake\". \n\nThe party had just finished killing off a mummy that was trying to create an army of sand elementals so it could retake it's lost kingdom. It's weapon of choice was Dunewake, a lawful neutral scimitar that would have been great for any of the party, made even better by the fact it's ambition was to ensure that it's master learned all the sword knew regarding planar arcane lore, so they could eventually slay a malign stone elemental. But that never happened, the party never even got out of the tomb before things got heated.  \n\n\nThe first to lay claim to it was the wizard, who had dealt the finishing blow and also would benefit the most from it's arcane knowledge boost. But the fighter said it should be his because it came under his weapon focus feat, and weapon mastery feat, therefore he'd be better with it than anyone else possibly would. The ranger wanted it to, because he had been shafted on melee weapons and he wanted something special for once. The cleric took the sword while they were all bickering and examined it, finding that the sword was actually crafted by a long dead, but rather exalted cleric of his own faith. So naturally, the cleric wanted it to.\n\nThe wizard, being lawful evil, threw the first shot at the fighter, using dominate person on him...which failed. The fighter responded in the same way most fighters would, hitting him with a full round attack action which instantly minced the wizard, leaving him as nothing more than a red stain across the floor. The ranger attacked the fighter soon after with a wand of webbing before backing up, and the cleric doubled down on it with a black tentacles spell, immobilizing him and dealing damage every turn until he could escape. The ranger then killed the cleric with a headshot before pelting the fighter. the fighter nearly got close enough to hit the ranger, but was just five feet short, dropping dead at his feet.  \n\n\nThe ranger, now with the awesome sword, unsheathed it once again, proclaimed himself as it's master...and promptly got mentally dominated by the sword because it refused to have a chaotic neutral as it's master. The sword made him disembowel himself on the spot, thus ending the campaign on a very sudden and flat note.  \n\n\nThis is why I specialize loot, have a rule at my table called \"the party first\" and don't give wizards nice melee weapons.",

        "text": "I have a penchant for modifying classes a bit for my players, for better or worse. Not major changes normally, usually just rewording an ability so it can be easier or more fun to use, or making extra feats for them to take to better benefit the flow of gameplay. This is one of my greater blunders.\n\nThe country had been pummeled by meteors, every day more would fall and cause vast chunks of land to be set ablaze and reduced to rubble, even the capital city, with a barrier of arcane energy, wouldn't be able to hold out for ever, especially with the influx of migrants packing in and causing riots due to shortages of supplies being passed out. The heroes, who had previously pulled off several great feats, were personally employed by the king to see what the hell was going on and to bring an end to it.\n\nThrough a series of mini quests, side events and one very stupid fight against a door, they discovered that the meteors were all coming from one central point in the sky, and not raining down from every angle, whats more, it was only happening to a set amount of the kingdom, it's most northern and southern parts were left completely unscathed, as were the nations to the east, though the west got a nasty nip across the borders. By this info, they plotted a course up into the sky using a magic carpet, the clever use of the levitate spell and some rope. Waiting for a lull in the meteor swarms so they could ascend uncontested.\n\nWhen they got there, they found a massive flying castle inhabited by a small clergy of dragonborn who worshipped Garyx, along with the ring leader of this whole affair, an aged wyrm space dragon. Turns out it was trying to make a mating sign for another space dragon and also wanted a safe place for its kids to grow up while also having access to food, water and a decent horde...but not with all of the other smart races down there, viewing them as short lived ameba upon a dusty ball who only produced valuables for the higher races.\n\nThe dragon left the party to fight the dragonborn clerics, which went surprisingly well after they realized that those armoured dragonborn had no way to fly, and the monk took to rugby tackling them off the side of the castle, only to get yanked back up by the barbarian who was tied to him by a rope around their waists. After that, there was a few more fights inside the building, and an encounter with a wizard who had taken up residence within a tower. He made them an offer, they let him keep the castle \\(the party gets all the loot inside aside from a few specified things\\), and he helps them kill the dragon. Amazingly, they agreed despite knowing the guy was lawful evil \\(Paladin scanned him when they entered the room\\).\n\nThey called the dragon out while at the balcony overlooking the courtyard and immediately leapt down to murder his ass. They literally jumped, the barbarian and paladin both taking swings at his wings to keep him down while the monk tried to grapple his mouth shut, the others just wailed on him while the NPC wizard fired off death spells. But the dragon phased through them all on his turn, took to the skies, and decided to risk a meteor blast to catch them all and hopefully kill a few. The monk, noticing this, prepared to use stop projectile. Not deflect missile, stop projectile. This is the change I made. The monk was able to burn Ki points to add an extra D10 to his roll to reduce the damage, and this effected spells that used projectiles as well, like acid arrow or fireball.\n\nHe caught the meteor alright, burning eight ki points to stop the huge ball of death before the rest of the party were blown to pieces, then said \"so I've caught it...can I throw it back?\". I mean, wouldn't you let him try to toss it?\n\nHe threw it right back after nat 20ing the strength roll, making the dragon take the full impact of it to the face before getting the barbarian to cut the rope that tied them together, and toss him up to the dragon again. The meteor and the first round of combat had done well over 200 damage by that point, and he was hanging on by a third of his health when the monk started smacking him in the face again with flurry of blows. The rest of the party wasn't able to do much apart from the spellcasters and the NPC wizard, so the dragon's next turn saw him try to use another meteor spell by burning up several spellslots at once \\(Because i was determined to hit the party with at least one of these things\\). The monk, let go of the dragon, got in front of his mouth, burned all his ki points, and caught the meteor. Since they were so close, I just had the meteor hit him as well when he tossed it back, and it was only then that we all realized that the dragon was flying rather close to the edge of the castle. I rolled a D8 to decide the direction he flew off in after the explosion, right off the edge was the direction.\n\nThe dragon I just killed at that point, it had about fifty HP left, but after a display like that, there really wasn't any point. So the monk and the dragon plummeted to the planet while the barbarian jumped off the edge after them with the carpet under his arm, the monk spread himself out to increase drag while the barbarian made himself straight as an arrow, rocketing into the monk for a big ol bear hug. They both got on the carpet...and kept falling. Their combined weight was greater than the carrying capacity of the carpet. Now, they could have decided that one of them should live, but since the barbarian had 4 int, and the monk was sporting a grand total of 8, neither of them were smart enough to realize this, and they both plummeted to their deaths, splattered across the barrier that covered the capital city.",

        "text": "Last summer I was part of a unique idea for a campaign, there was a website that you entered in information like how many sit ups you could do, math problems etc, and it would calculate what character class you would be.  Next we were playing ourselves, like we were sucked into a DnD world.  The ultimate meta.  \n\n  The plot is a little hazy but here’s what I retained, an eldritch being spoke to our warlock, S.  (for privacy sake I’ll just be using the first letter of our names) It revealed that it had been eyeing her for some time and would like aide in a matter, S agrees.  As our usual group meets up to play DnD we take our seats our Dm is about to begin a session we are sucked into a fantasy world.  We land in the middle of a village atop raised platforms, naked.  There is a gathering of mages and townsfolk staring at awe at us.  We are quickly ushered inside by the eldest mage and he casts a spell that allows us to understand their language.  He explains that he and the other wizards had just completed a ritual to summon the legendary heroes, he got us instead.  The arch mage goes on to explain this world’s plight, a set of magical attuning devices needs to be reactivated and we are this worlds only option due to how much magic is needed for the summoning spell.  We agree, S becomes the warlock of legend, R the renowned paladin, K the mightiest warrior, A the wizard and I become the bard.  \n\nThroughout the campaign I made choices that annoyed both party and Dm, due to the nature of playing ourselves I did just that.  I won’t sugar coat it, I am a lazy guy, so during certain situations I would tell the Dm, I lay down and nap.  This led to our party either getting captured or nearly tpked every other encounter.  It all came to a head at one session in the funniest way and easing the tension ever so lightly.  \n\n  We approach one of the northern most villages after freeing ourselves from a tribe of elves.  How, we taught them the joy of Christmas, sledding, snowball fights stuff like that, I napped.  A, mutters under his breath,\n\n  “Honestly just stop napping, contribute.”  I smirk\n\n  “I’ll bring it under consideration.” The party gives me the death glare.  In the distance we see a village with many stables with Yak moose hybrids, S falls in love with them.  Moment she spots one she says excitedly\n\n  “I want one!”  A, our Dm, replies,\n\n  “This is probably this village’s lively hood, we can’t just…” S cuts him off,\n\n  “Can we steal one?”  A goes wide eyed,\n\n  “You know we are supposed to be this world’s heroes.”  S nods her head slowly in agreement and contemplates on how to get one of these yak moose beasts.  When we reach the village the villagers eye us with suspicion.  The village elder approaches us,\n\n  “Hail adventurers!” We all greet the elder.  He goes on to offer us lodging, food and water so long as we look into a matter.  One of the villagers has gone missing and he was last seen in the hut at the end of the village.  We agree.  Our party investigates and find a hidden room with a dwarf missing a leg chained to a wall and a chest.  (I should mention at this time we were doing a round robin Dm thing and it was R’s session to Dm) We free the dwarf and he asks desperately \n\n  “By the gods, how did you get past those…things?” I look at him, confused \n\n  “What things?” I ask, at the same time K goes for the chest, it is a mimic, we kill the mimic.  The dwarf goes on to explain one by one the village was replaced by horrid creatures, then the houses.  We were in a village of mimics.  Once we stabilize the dwarf we go outside, this quaint adventure has turned into a DnD rendition of John Carpenter’s, The Thing, if everyone and the building were The Thing.  Outnumbered we make for the neighboring mountain and climb for our lives.  We reach the mouth of a cave with jagged stalactites and stalagmites around the edge.  Paying no mind we enter, as we do, A jokingly says.\n\n  “You know, in DnD lore a Mimic could be anything, hell even one in the shape of a mountain.”  The party nods and press on, R, remains silent.  As we go further into the cave we begin to feel a rumble, the cave has closed in on itself.  We reach a wide room within the cave and it begins filling up with molten lava.  It is indeed a mountain sized mimic and we just walked willy nilly into the stomach.  Climbing for our lives we pass a series of climb checks we reach another, wider room.  At the far end is an obsidian mirror.  A voice that sounds like granite speaks to us, the mountain mimic says wickedly\n\n  “So, you have found my source, congratulations heroes of legend, you must know there is no escape!  And now, a question, what is it you mortals fear most of all? Simple, yourselves…you cannot go a day with judging, double guessing or questioning your every action and that shall be your doom.”  Once he finishes speaking the aforementioned obsidian mirror opens a shadowy portal and out walk shadowy copies of the party.  One by one we engage ourselves in battle…then it comes to me.  My shadow clone approaches me.  I hold up my hands and say with zeal.\n\n  “Hey…hey before we brutally murder each other hear me out.  You are me, so you know me and I am you so I know you…we know who we are.  More than likely you’re everything I view negatively in myself, so I know you don’t want to fight.  Hell we both know we are lazy, like to sleep in way past anyone’s business and we could really…really smoke a bowl right now.”  R, astonished at what is going on asks me to roll persuasion check with advantage.  I pass.  I spend the entirety of combat smoking weed and playing bongos with my shadow clone.  As I chill I throw out bardic inspiration additionally bards have an ability called song of rest, which allows anyone who hears my music to add a D6 to the benefits of taking a short rest.  I argued I was technically having a short rest with my shadow clone and so I could heal the party.  R thinks it over and agrees.  By doing nothing I am doing something, I have taken out the support by becoming the support.  Alas all good things come to an end.  Combat ends only my shadow clone remains.  I offer for him to stay with us, we could always use another useless bard but he solemnly shakes his head and walks into the portal  He places one hand into the air and another onto the mirror.  I place a hand to his as he calls lightning, electrocuting himself to death, killing Mount Mimic.  I understood, so long as he lived so did the mountain.  All that remains is an obsidian sword which if you looked closely you could see a reflection of a friendly face.  With the mountain dead all of the mimcs below die, to our surprise the yak moose hybrids were real, we take one and leave.  \n",

        "text": "Strap yourselves down because this is a long journey. So my character was an rogue/assassin halfling who ran a side business as a hit man tough guy (halfling tough guy I know). I was employed by one of the members of our party and went on a few quests before we ended up in a tavern to relax and try to find more work. \n\nWe had a Druid who’s spirit was fused with a bear that was causing our party a lot of problems so my employer gave me 2000g to poison him with some very potent “poison” (he didn’t tell me what it was, and I failed a speech check so he wouldn’t tell me). I went up to our Druid bear and before I could distract him he told me to drink with him. I politely declined but the Druid decided to insist. \n\nThis is where everything goes down hill for my halfling. He rolled a nat 20. The Druid already had high charisma (because he wanted to be a very convincing bear) so adding a nat 20 to that meant I had to drink with him. Our dm let him decide how many drinks we’d have. We decided to get absolutely plastered drunk. We were singing and having a jolly time. As soon as I got a chance to get away I did. \n\nI rolled really well sneaking away but when I got to the druids beer and pulled the poison out I rolled a 1. For those who aren’t familiar with different rolls, a 1 is the absolute worst you can roll and 20 being best. When I tried to open up the bag of poison, I was so drunk I used too much force and the poison flung into my face. I let out a blood curdling scream and fell on the floor. \n\nWhen the party came to check what was wrong I had a strange fungus growing on my face. Our wizard helped me up as I was rubbing my eyes, and I heard a voice behind me. Of all the people it was it had to be our parties glorified dog. I turned around and what I saw was a giant furry tree with devilish teeth. Our DM told us I had developed schizophrenia at this point. I screamed and tried to attack with my short sword. Thankfully our wizard stunned me, because I was about ready to kill everyone in that room. \n\nThey brought me up to one of the rooms and tied me down to bed. When I came to I cried for help and the party went into the room. When they came in, all I saw was our Druid bear as the walls(not a typo I literally saw the bear AS the walls of the room). I don’t know why but it calmed me seeing a furry wall with a door for a mouth. \n\nAfter they untied me, we set out on a quest to retrieve an amulet from a dragon infested swamp. About half way through the forest leading to the swamp we decided to make camp. During the night my employer, who inadvertently gave me schizophrenia, astral projected himself and cashed in a favor from a godlike being to “cure” my schizophrenia. What ended up happening is he changed it from schizophrenia to dual personality disorder. \n\nThe two personalities I ended up with was my normal self, but my other one was a chaotic evil thief named Fark, who only looked out for himself. So my employer told everyone I was cured, but I would have 2 different personalities. They marked it off as a win, but they were wrong. Dead wrong. \n\nWe came up to a broken down cart, which we assumed held a very important key we needed to get the amulet. A few feet away was a group of hobgoblins guarding it. As the party went to fight, Fark (my evil personality) went to unlock the chests in the cart. I ended up rolling really poorly and activated a bomb trap that was in the chest almost killing me. By the time I was knocked away from the chest my party defeated the hobgoblins and scolded me for destroying the only thing that would make our quest a cakewalk. \n\nNothing too crazy happened for a while after that. We went through the swamp, fought and befriended the dragon that resided there, and found a map to the amulet. We started following the map and ended up in a really foggy area of the swamp. \n\nWe were walking and I heard this voice in my head convincing me to kill our wizard. I failed my rolls and stabbed our wizard in the chest with a really high roll. I knocked him down with a fatal blow. That’s when everyone else noticed we walked into a mindflayer trap. We got our wizard back up and started fighting them, but because my mind was already weak from my dual personality, they manipulated me to again strike a fatal blow on our wizard. We were saved by our dragon friend, and helped out our wizard. We finally retrieved the amulet and  headed back to the city. \n\nBut again Fark found himself wanting to cause the most destruction as he possibly could. We arrived in the town square and I saw a noble with a large sack of gold on his hip. I tried to use my dagger to cut it off, but I had rolled another 1. I tripped and stabbed the Nobel. When I rolled for attack, knowing my luck, I rolled a 20. Absolutely decimated the dude. Fark loved it. This started a riot in the town. We were fighting level 1 npcs, so we didn’t have too much to worry about. That’s when our Tiefling (kinda looks like Satan but she was super friendly) Druid summoned the sewer rats to aid us. I had convinced her to temporarily give me animal speech, and I became king of the rats. I had them carry me into battle, and slaughtered about half of the mob, and the Tiefling told me to throw a bomb up in the air so I did. She hit it with a fireball scroll, it exploded, and took care of the rest of the mob. We were exiled from the town and never turned the quest in. \n\nThanks for sticking around to the end. Our group ended up breaking off before we had anymore sessions. All this happened with a 2 hour sessions. ",

        "text": "Two spells, when combined, have a surprisingly game breaking effect when used on an NPC of great importance. Speak with dead, and Raise dead. \n\nHere's the set up, the party just captured the big yakuza style mob boss of the eastern district of this massive mega city the campaign takes place in. He ran the slavery and prostitution rackets of his particular organization, but since he was a eunch, he had little interest in fucking the product and just made cold hard cash off of their asses. This guy was fucking badass, really high will saves and they could not get anything out of him aside from brief bits of info that didn't really help them in a major way. They even tortured him for a while, but since they were all good alignments, they couldn't stomach it for long and gave up. He was kept locked in the basement of their base, occasionally poked for info, but they got nothing. Eventually they got a hold of his friend and tried to get some info out of him, but this guy didn't know as much because he had been out of the city for a while and was only now returning, they caught him upon entry.\n\nAfter a while, the cleric gets a terrifyingly clever plan together. Both men will most definitely be going to hell, or the abyss, whichever is worse. So, they will no doubt want to come back to life if they are killed. Their body can be asked questions and give truthful answers if they recognize that the person they are speaking to is friendly. So, the bard cast disguise person on the cleric, they cut of the mob bosses head, did the same to his friend, and then used speak with undead on one of them, looking like the other. Using this tactic repeatedly, they got all the information they wanted and more, and upon the tenth day, they resurrected both men and left them to cool off in seperate cells with bags over their heads so they couldn't see or hear each other. \n\nWhen I say they got all the information they wanted, I mean they got stuff I had been trying to keep shrouded for ages, like spies, business fronts, names of important people, the works. Every time they found someone else who was important, they'd cut off the head, take their head and body back home, use the same tactic, then stick their revived ass into a cell for potential use later on. After an in game month, they had fifteen people they were routinely killing, resurrecting and asking questions.\n\nIt came to a head when they started getting knocks on their door from inevitables who were pissed that someone was constantly ressurecting a group of people on mass on a regular basis, but they were prepared for that. They got to a point where they could start using soul gems, so they didn't even need to bother with the ressurecting, and now they didn't need to rely on the song and dance to get info.\n\nIt got to a point where they stopped doing intrigue and almost exclusively killed people who had valuable information that they wanted to know, keeping the souls locked up in gems until they had everything they wanted. They didn't even seem to care about the alignment swap and level drop that came with it, granted, it sucked ass for them and they didn't like it, but they didn't care in the sense that they didn't care enough to stop.\n\nEventually I had to put my foot down and really lean into the roleplay aspect of things, with their budding reputation attracting unsavoury sorts who wanted to do business with them. This had the undesired effect of splitting the party, with the wizard sneaking out one night with all the soul gems they collected and went off to join the necromancer circle. But it turned into a positive when he agreed to retire his character, and made a new one, thus losing the ability to make soul gems.\n\nMatters were made worse when the cleric got another bright idea. He learned the create soul gem spell, to start ransoming the souls of men to their families, wait until they were ressurected, then ransom their enemies families to them...Which they actually did. They broke into a small manor in the city, creeping through the place, hunting for a mother and child. They choked the boy out in his crib and snapped the mothers neck by choking her out in a four man grapple attack after they had sold the mans soul to them and he was brought back. They then repeated the process before just killing the man, putting his soul in a gem, then sold all three to the necromancer circle because they wanted the extra cash.\n\nAfter that, I gave up and switched the campaign around. They had started as some hired adventurers in a corrupt city, tasked with getting rid of this corrupt organization who had been causing lots of problems for everyone, and ended up as another corrupt group of child killers. But hey, that's D&amp;D.",

        "text": "  So, another entry into my Rifts campaign, another session that made me laugh uncontrollably.  We have our con artist assassin, the metal head and a few new faces.  A techno wizard teenager with a Back to The Future style hover board that emitted a rainbow trail (yes it played the Nyan cat song) and a NPC wolfkin named Moon Moon.  So early on in the campaign I rewarded the group with a van that was recreated to look like the Scooby Doo van except with a few modifications.  First it could do interdimensional jumps second a bunch of weapons outfitted on the front such as ion cannons, missiles and the like.  Finally the inside was swanky, it was enchanted to be bigger in the inside, was very spacious, had its own fridge, freezer combo stacked with booze, beds and most importantly a roast duck button.  Under the CD player was a big red button simply labeled in big white lettering DUCK, it would produce Peking roast duck and duck sauce.  It got a few laughs and even more uses.\n\n  So, most of my sessions were on the fly due to the nature of rifts and wanting to have a feel that my players could go anywhere.  This particular session was planned and later a minor part of the ending.  Due to messing with a powerful interdimensional force, they were jumping rifts continually, finally overheating the jump drive sending them into a random rift.  More importantly it was time to learn where this most excellent Peking roast duck came from and its terrible secret.  Once they were on the planet and dimension they had rifted to several things were amiss.  First the planet seemed devoid of life, what architecture was there was in ruins, this planet seemed to have either been in some form or war or post-apocalyptic event.  Finally they find what appears to be the Lincoln memorial they enter.  Much to their shock it is indeed the Lincoln memorial but only if Lincoln were a duck!  Planet of the apes sans apes…it was duck world.  Upon seeing this humanoid ducks appeared out of nowhere, chanting.  With a gargantuan elephant sized \"regular\" duck in the middle of them.  Once the party is spotted they are mistaken for the evil invaders and unleash the elephant sized duck upon them.  They kill the majority of them but the elephant sized duck has turned into a massive problem.  He nearly kills the party and wrecks the van (the van is constantly wrecked) angered greatly by this my metal head wizard rummages through the remains and asks.\n\n  “Is the roast duck button still intact?”  I wasn’t sure of what he was doing but none the less rolled with it.\n  “The device is mostly intact but not operable.”  He gives me a smile and replies with a chuckle.\n  “Good, can I roll to make an IED with the remains? A roast Duck IED?” The room goes silent as what he’s asking sinks in.  My dining room table erupts into laughter and I allow the roll, it passes.  He hucks the bomb at the giant duck and POOF an elephant sized Peking roast duck cooked to perfection. The remaining duck cultists in awe slowly make their way to our party.  They surrender.  The techno wizard teenager hands over a translating device and activates it, the duck goes on to exclaim\n  “What…what have you done with our Goddess, Alabio!”  He exclaims \n\n  “We ordered Chinese to go.”  Amazed and astonished at what happened the ducks come to the conclusion only a god can slay a god.  With a bluff check from the con artist they make the ducks believe what they fear, a new pantheon has arisen on duck world.  \n  “My Lords, eat of Alabio’s flesh and be nourished by her Godly essence!” the eldest cult member proclaims.  My party feasted that night.  As the feast went on the duck people recounted their history, it was mostly just a retelling of our world history only duck people.  Where it diverged is in the late twentieth century dinosaur aliens attacked (any mighty ducks the cartoon fans here?) the battles were terrible, the duck peoples defenses low.  Once peace was finally found a new stranger event began.  As the world was healing citizens of duck world would disappear, a random rift opening up sucking in the poor citizen.  At first they blamed the dino invaders but they denied any involvement and resparked the war.  As I explained this in detail my metal head was the first recognize it, going wide eyed, then the techno wizard teen.  Before they could even say anything I nod my head and say \n\n  “Yes, you may be duck gods now but know that it came with a terrible price, you first were duck cannibals.”  Laughter erupts followed by a sullen silence at the dark realization.  They never mention it to the ducks.  All of the party proceed to eat the duck god along with Moon Moon.  I have them roll a save check to see if the vast amount of food makes them sleepy.  Only the metal head passes.  Everyone else passes out for a day and half, cause it takes stamina to digest an elephant sized Peking roast duck.  Once they awaken everyone who passed out are dubbed the gods of the long sleep while the metal head has become the God of Music and Metal.\n",

        "text": "So, I am currently running a 5e campaign in a world I worked on over the winter and this is the result. \n\nThe world of Lunterra has been locked in what has been dubbed The Endless War sparked by a difference in beliefs between two super powers the militaristic Empire of Goshall and the Vhell Republic.  Lasting for thousands of years their entire cultures have evolved to fuel a brutal war machine.  In the last ten years an uneasy cease fire has been called out of necessity.  Due to all the blood spilled a rift to the abyss opened allowing a powerful demon, Xilbiac to assault the mortal plane.  United against a common enemy the Empire and Republic eventually close the rift at a heavy cost.\n\n  The campaign begins in a small village called Chestbrooke, home to one of the last remaining arch druids Urzi, who helped create the primary weapon used against the abyss, the Druid Stones, five powerful ruby stones that struck the final blow to Xilbiac.  I only have two in my group at the moment, first there is Admen istrator, a warforged paladin of conquest who was made specifically created to fight the Empire and drop fire puns.  Second we have a living suit of armor crafted by a dwarf named spicy.  Tranquil-0 the planar jouster monk a living embodiment of the iron man suit up scenes.\n\n Admen and Tranqil-0 are outside of Chestbrooke acting as scouts/guards for the village.  When they get to the nearest outpost things have clearly gone south, first no one is there, second their perception rolls lead them to said outpost watchmen's dead bodies and two bandits.  They consider stealth for a brief second but just go yolo and confront the would be attackers head on.  Its then they realize one of the bandits as an old friend, R-7 another warforged.  On his forehead is a weird glowing sigil along with the woman he is with.  Out from the bushes a third bandit emerges a young kid no older than eighteen.  They fight and knock the woman and R-7 unconscious the kid who didn't hit a single person surrenders and introduces himself as bardock only in it for gold he agrees to help the party and admits he doesn't know what the mark is.  They accept what bardock says and promptly knock him out as a safety precaution.  As they are heading back to Chestbrooke a villager laden with arrows tells them of an attack led by Goshallan airships.  The party hop skipitiy jumps back to the village with a summoned spectral horse carrying the captives.\n\n  When they get back the village is in ruins.  The arch druid is standing on a magically raised plateau using the elements like the avatar to shoot airships out of the sky.  He orders Admen and Tranquil-0 to retrieve the druid stones and get his granddaughter out of here to the neighboring village of Crows Reach where an old friend is.  Admen, as a paladin of conquest has his own idea and asks if the arch druid could help him get to an airship.  Urzi creates a stairway from the earth that leads directly to one, Admen rushes up and just starts throwing people over the side.  While this is going on Tranquil-0 is scanning the village for Shalina, Urzi's granddaughter.  He meets resistance by enemy ground troops but he just doesn't have the time and in a single move and a godly roll he punches every single soldier, now with all of the things this player chose for his character he has a speed of like 40 45, so he is like metal sonic and he just proceeds to run circles around the troops punching them until they are either knocked out or dead  he gets to Urzi's hut, moment he sees Shalina, he proclaims \"Hop in\" and describes how he opens up like an iron man suit.  \n\n  Meanwhile on the airship Admen has engaged the entirety of the crew and with a high intimidate roll convinces most of the air sailors to surrender only for the captain to pop out and a brawl ensues that nearly brings Admen to half health but ultimately wins and tosses the captain overboard turns to the last six crewmen and informs them captain Philips style he is the captain now, and with a failed will save on their part agree.  With the ship acquired and granddaughter suited up Urzi orders them to run when a powerful Goshallan Wizard teleports in with a bolt of lightning and engages in a fight with the aged druid.  The last thing Urzi sees is Admen at the helm of the ship, redubbing the vessel, the Python.\n  As they travel to Crows Reach Shalina, a very talented twelve year old girl repairs both Tranquil-0 and Admen.  It’s revealed here in their year serving as Chestbrooke’s guards she had really taken to both.  With few friends she dedicated much of her time working with machines and the material their both crafted from, shardinite, a rare mineral that only master crafting dwarves can fully understand.  After Urzi’s sacrifice she refused to sleep and began working a predator style shoulder cannon for both Tranquil-0 and Admen.  As she was getting measurements for Tranquil-0 it goes off, melting a giant hole in the steel door and scaring Tranquil-0.  Shalina promises to fix the random blasting and continues to work, Tranquil-0 reminds her to sleep and have some food before leaving, a reminder that more than likely is ignored.\n",

        "text": "I normally give the players bags of holding, as do many other DMs, although I make the bags I give them have more space than they'll usually ever need, mainly because I don't like worrying about weight limits for equipment. After this campaign, I had to decrease the sizes of bag I gave them. I also encourage player creativity, as it results in even the most useless of spells becoming so stupidly good that you wonder why people don't try this stuff more often.\n\nThe players were enlisted by a nobleman who wanted to take an expedition to a long abandoned continent that had supposedly been inhabited at one point by ancient civilizations. It only recently became accessible due to shifts in currents around its coast, so naturally everyone is rushing to get there to exploit the loot left in the ruins. The party gets on and makes it there after watching a kraken destroy a ship trying to leave the island, a not so subtle hint that they've all been trapped there and can no longer escape via conventional means. They did have a wizard in the group, but he wouldn't be learning any long distance transportation spells for a while.\n\nThey set up shop by converting their ship into a make shift longhouse and set up defenses around the parameter, giving them a solid base of operations for the time being. Armed with a few magical items way better than what they should have had at their current level \\(a huge bag of holding, boots of spider walking, etc\\), they set out to go exploring. They found some of the other docked ships, some of them having mutinied and gone rogue, others were setting up just fine, but most of them were definitely not friendly. The only guy worth mentioning right now would be a group of mages who could teleport back and forth from the continent without worry, but they were there for research and profit, thus they refused to teleport anyone back home without paying a hefty sum. These guys were the only people they could sell their goods to for a long while.\n\nThe party set out into the jungle, dealing with beasts mostly until they got to some ruins, where they discovered that there were still some cyclops left alive, only far more tribal than the legends had foretold. The cyclops were hunting the people who had docked on shore, but as they were relatively small in number \\(about 30 in all\\), they didn't pose a huge threat to the fleet of nearly 800 people. The party decided to sneak in and see what relics they could find, relying on the cyclops as a buffer against other adventurers so they could get first pickings. To their credit, they stealthed like motherfuckers, sneaking past them all with great care and got inside the temple. But their luck had to run out some time and they were forced to kill a high priest of the cyclops who had blindsense. They scrambled to collect the loot, but the one thing they wanted more than anything else was a giant statue of a cyclops, made entirely of gold and decorated with gemstones. That's when the wizard had a stroke of genius.\n\nOne of their party members was a goliath, and the bag of holding had shifted a bit to match his size when he took hold of it. Enlarge person has all your gear get bigger with you when it is cast. So, he hit the goliath with the spell, and they argued that they could fit the statue into their bag of holding with ease, along with the corpse of the priest. I did the math on how much that statue would weigh, something to the tune of several tones, I can't remember the exacts. Then they showed me my own magic item stat card. Bag of superior holding, carries 50 tons worth of items, the bag can fit one average medium sized creature through it's opening when opened fully. They shoved the body and the statue in before hiding up in the rafters, watched the cyclops leave again to form a war party, while two stuck around in order to check the \"rest of the temple\". \n\nThey waited until just one cyclops was left before making use of exploit number two of enlarge person. The guy was patrolling the bottom area, but they didn't want to raise the alarm again, and they weren't healthy enough to kill him after the battle with the priest. A few plans rolled across the table, drop the statue on him, the force alone would kill him, bring the roof down on him, try to sneak out via the open sections of the roof and escape, or just wait. In the end, they cast enlarge person on the goliath again, and he jumped down onto the cyclops. His reasoning was that the combined force of his body hitting the cyclops, plus the smashing force of his mace to the back of his skull, would kill it in one swift strike. They rolled for it, nat 20, it fucking worked. Another body into the body bag.\n\nAfter returning to the ship area, they deposted the bodies with the mages, got some nice rewards, picked out a few magic items they wanted to keep from their horde pile and went on a few more adventures. The wizard ended up making a ring of enlarge person, except it's at will, and has no end to the duration, effectively allowing someone to be one size larger for however long they wanted. Thus we come to the best use they found for it.\n\nBy using it in conjunction with a hat of disguise they stole from one of the other ships, they had the goliath perfectly imitate the other cyclops, thus allowing him to walk by with impunity into the temple, clear the rest of the treasure out, and take very large charcol sketches of the walls for research, all while the rest of the party hid in his sack. He even managed to seduce a female cyclops with a few extremely lucky rolls, and the rest of the party had to put up with him fucking a cyclops for three hours while they sat in the bag. This wasn't the only time they used this exploit either, as the island had a fair few cloisters of giantfolk.\n\nThe funniest application of the ring was when they gave it to the halfing rogue, it just made him look like a stocky human, it did practically nothing for him but he kept wearing the ring anyway, his reason being that he wanted to see what a half human half halfling would look like, the half wit.",

        "text": "So it’s been nearly two years since I ran this campaign so memory is fuzzy on how it exactly went down but here it goes. For people who aren’t familiar with rifts it’s a tabletop RPG where magic has resurfaced after the fall of a golden age of man.  Rifts to the multiverse opened in places of magic like Stonehenge, the Nazca lines etc.\n\n  I was running a rifts campaign with my usual group and was having them assassinate old Pc’s of mine from other games I was part of.  This particular character was a Pokémon trainer from the jhoto region.  He was in a rebuilt Vegas living as a warlord, hidden away from the outside world after losing all his friends from the end of that campaign.  My group was comprised a metal head wizard, a class the player and I retrofitted from a techno wizard, pretty much a wizard who uses his magic with advanced tech getting the best of both worlds, a con artist thief that was sadly a little underpowered compared to the rest of the party, an elemental fusionist a living battery for the forces of two elements wind/earth, fire/water and an Apok, a powerful warrior that gains power from his home world itself.  So they scope out his penthouse, from one of the local homeless they pay off the Pokémon trainer has a prostitute visit him every day at four.  Checking the time in their interdimensional Scooby Doo van they realize its three forty.  They spot the prostitute and she’s about to reach the penthouse.  With limited time they frantically put together a real…real risky plan.  Hitting the gas the elemental fusionist opens the side door to the van and yells at the top of his lungs\n\n  “Ho grabbing time!”  All in direct view of the local authorities as he snatches the poor woman into the van.  She is screaming for help, the crew tries to console their kidnap victim to no avail.  The police chase after them, now at this point the metal head had his heart replaced with the heart of metal by the archangel Ozzy Osbourne, guardian of muses and musicians.  A side effect is that he could no longer get drunk, with a bottle of vodka in hand he was the groups “designated driver” He takes a hefty chug as he maxes the volume to Mastodon’s Blood Mountain and mutters to himself\n\n  “Here we go” with a godly driving check he is able to evade the cops.  Once they are safe they drop off the apok and con artist to do the deed and kill a Pokémon trainer.  All the while the metal head and fusionist are conflicted, they cannot let the woman go lest she go to the cops and they didn’t want an innocent woman’s blood on their hand, it is then the fusionist has a brainstorm\n  “Olaf, open the portal!”  Olaf, the metal head nods and asks gruffly \n\n  “Where”\n\n  “The one place no one will ever look.”  They go half way around the world to Bora Bora and strand her at a beach side bar.  She yells, take me home you bastards, their reply, grab a seat at the bar, order a pint and wait for this whole assassination business to blow over.  \n\n  Back in Vegas the apok and the con artist infiltrate the penthouse the apok stays on the floor level in case the target slips through the con artists grasp.  During the metal head and fusionist’s ordeal the con artist and apok talked over the plan, the con artist would use her feminine wiles and pretend to be a replacement prostitute.  At the locked door, there is a thumb print scanner for a lock, she gives a quick knock, the Pokémon trainer calls out from the other side,\n\n  “Where’s Megan, my usual? This wasn’t part of my deal with Fabio!” with a strong bluff check the con artist convincingly lies\n  “Megan’s retired, sweetie, I am the new girl.”  The door opens to reveal what had become of my Pokémon trainer, after a losing battle with a necromancer his old body had been destroyed and his new vessel, a tiny Namekian.  He turns and makes for his bed, the con artist brandishes her tactical knife, only to be spotted by my Pokémon trainer’s concealed voltorb on his poke ball belt, it yells goes in for the kamikaze self-destruct but with a nat 20 she is able to roundhouse kick it out of the window, with their scheme revealed my Pokémon trainer tries to get to the panic button but another nat 20 from the con artist allows her to tackle him, her knife lost in the ensuing scuffle there is only one option now, she goes for his belt and rips it off and has a brilliant idea on how to cover up this murder, accidental strangulation via auto erotic asphyxiation.  In all my time Dming I never thought I would utter this next sentence.\n  “With practiced precision you lift up the little namekian he makes horrid gurgling noises that slowly patter out, he has been auto erotically assassinated.\n",

        "text": "I recently started a new campaign for D&amp;D called *‘Blood of Elder Race’*. I have my reasons for the name of the new campaign. I worked ridiculously hard during the past two months on it; researching fey creatures and the Drows \\(since my gf was interested in playing a Drow\\). I had to research elvish culture which I have still not completed. I would have preferred working full time on it but I have a full time job and I was playing the *‘Sunless Citadel’*.\n\nOur journey begins aboard The Podargus, a few hundred miles from Emon, on a ship on its way to Tal’dorei. On the upper deck, the bard dandelion is singing is ballad about the 3 girls of his life whom he laid with after he just doing their mother. The song ends with song drunk laughter as a sailor comes together with travelers and nobles. The atmosphere is very jovial. \n\nWhile everyone is having a good time on the upper deck of the Podargus, a few men were keeping themselves distant from the crowd. Playing a game of card on a barrel. One of them, thew a gold piece at the bard who has paused to receive a few coins as token of appreciation. \n\n* “You told ya to stop, troubadour!? More music! It has brought me nothing but wining hands!”\n\nHe is shirtless and has several tooth missing as he is grinning at his opponents and uneven facial hair. The dealer, another fellow sailor, wearing a fez and a white shirt deals one more card to everyone.  As he crushes his adversaries, he looks at the crowd who has been listening to Dandelion\n\n* “Anyone of you would like a fair game of Quick Queen’s Call?”\n\nBehind them, under the shadows of her hood, a woman with obsidian skin tone is looking from far as a redhead lady, Korri, and an armed man, Marko, makes the way to the card game.\n\n* “Fair you say? I will see about that but count me in.”\n\nThey both sit down in front of the barrel that has been used as table where two cards are dealt.\n\n* “Let’s start with a gold piece each.”\n* “Fair enough.”\n\nAs the dusk settle on the ship, everyone is already very drunk.  A fair amount of men were interested with the redhead who was seemingly unaccompanied and drunkenly dancing on the table. Through persistence and luck, Gustavio, a young man caught Korri as she almost fell from the table. As she struggled to get back on her feet, he went in for a kiss which was immediately haltered by the woman in the hood. Korri used that opportunity to whisper a spell in his ear. Her obsidian skin reflected against the moonlight which just started to shin brighter. The last thing he remembered as he fell unconscious on the ground was her crimson eyes.\n\nKorri got up and brushed her sleeves.\n\n* “Thank you.”\n* “You should be more careful among men like these.”\n* “True. They are not even my type to begin.”\n* “They truly have no manners.”\n* “I mean they don’t have boobs.”\n* “Oh.”\n* “Where are my manners? Korri, nice to meet you.” she says as she attempts to peer under the hood which causes her new acquaintance to pull it down further.\n* “Tara, nice meet you.”\n* “Not from around here are you? Don’t worry about it, my adoptive father was a Drow too.”\n\nWhile everyone is being rock to sleep by Dandelion’s lullaby. The sailors notice that the bard has accumulated quite a pot of gold at his feet. It would be a shame if something happened to him.",

        "text": "This story is an excellent example of why you don't rely on alignments to tell if people are against you\n\nThe party were going up against a vampire Lord who they had failed to keep sealed away. He had a shit ton of undead things at his back and call, so the players had to be careful no matter where they went because they knew that undead are my bread and butter for creative monster usage.\n\nThey decided the best way to kill the vamp would be to teleport him to the opposite side of the planet and fight him in the middle of a desert during the day. It would take some prep work, but they were determined to pull it off. They gathered friendly NPCs and resources before sailing off. Among them was the rogues family, who had been picked up last because they were supposedly safe inside the party stronghold. His wife mentioned having seen him before they arrived but she was half starved by that point due to the fort running out of supplies so they thought  nothing of it.\n\nOn the way, they made sure to sail in sunlight as fast as possible, discussing their plan in great detail under the deck. The baby of the rogue was always sickly but had a strong magical aura about him so they reckoned it just needed to be kept cool and out of direct sunlight for now.\n\nSkipping ahead, the party had some desert themed adventures while managing a caravan of people until they got to the desired location, a temple to the sun god pelor. With two extra levels under their belt they were able to use powerful magic to fortify the place against undead and anything else that dared to attack before setting up the ritual circle at the summet. The mother and her baby liked to watch as a teleportation circle took form from the shade of a nearby pillar. They were both still a little sickly from their time in the fort with no food, but the rogue just dotted on them all the more as he had little to do during the prep time aside from set traps.\n\nIn the night, as the party slept and prepared for tomorrow's brutal battle, they heard a loud blast from the peak, followed by the screeching of banshee and the roar some massive horror. A squad of banshee and an undead giant had been teleported to the circle and were wrecking house, with more on the way. The protective stuff they had set up was designed to keep things out, not to help them with monsters already inside.\n\nThey managed to kill them all but lost some npc friends in the process, the temple had been pretty badly busted up and  the circle had to bee destroyed in order to prevent more monsters from warping in. Their families were in various states of mild injury but the rogues wife and baby were fine.\n\nThey sat down and discussed their new plan of action, this time using a few teleport spells to get everyone to the northern pole, specifically to the northern winter elf tribes. One night of rest later and they teleported the rest of their friends to the pole where the sunlight was ensured for several more months. Everyone wrapped up in thick clothes and they set out to find the highrophont of winter, a druid who had been alive since the first frosts.\n\nWhen they arrived, the village was surprisingly quiet, despite recently disturbed snow. It wasn't until they got to the main hut that they discovered why. All the snow elves had been drained of their blood and left in one big hulking pile where a now vampire thrawlled highrophont sat, just barely able to keep himself from falling under the vampire lords control. They got a few answers out of him before he submitted and had to kill him. The biggest bit of info they got was that they had a spy in their midst.\n\nThe party knew they were all fine, so it was just the remains of their dear friends who had followed them across the world. They checked them all but none of them had bite marks, so they moved on to checking for anything amiss with detect undead and stuff like that. Only one presence stood out, an aura of chaotic evilit came from the wife of the rogue, still cradling her baby. She tried to convince them she was fine, that there must be some mistake...But they took the baby from her and killed her, burning her body so it couldn't be brought back as an undead. Shame they never bothered to check her body, especially that necklace she wore everywhere.\n\nThe rogue carried his baby as they left, finally deciding to just up and leave the planet to seek help from the angels. They managed to make their way to an apathetic arch mages tower who let them teleport through to heaven, but only in exchange for some of the magical items they possessed. The biggest struggle they faced was swarms of undead dogging them the entire way, killing more of their friends. \n\nIt wasn't until they stepped through the gate into the realm of light that they discovered who the true spy had been all that time. The baby had been crying all the way up the tower, but went strangely silent once they passed through the gate, shivering violently and turning a deep, choked purple before vomiting up a black, wailing ghost which disintegrated upon contact with heavens air. After that the baby was giggling and cheerful.\n\nI had put the mother under a geas spell, given her a necklace of alignment swapping so she was registered as chaotic evil despite actually being chaotic good, and used this to mask the fact the baby was possessed by a ghost. The players had killed her five minutes after learning of her blizzare alignment swap without checking her for magic items or any charms on her, and best of all, they were close to the mark with a guess. They thought she had been seduced by the vampire who had pretended to be the rogue to get into the fort, then willingly did his bidding. But I  reality he just geased her when she resisted. \n\nRemember to use detect magic people, it saves lives.",

        "text": "i guess this is the place to post about the misadventures of the group i am DMing a campaign of BC the Party Consists of a Thousand Sons Sorcerer, a Fleshshaper, and a Pirate Prince who is tired of all the Psykic Bullshit,\n\nI started them with the Broken Chains (this was two of the PC's intro to the 40k universe and all of ours to the system) it started fairly well they made it past several groups of Ghouls and Murder Servitors with out to much trouble they continued this way until they were ambushed in an enclosed smoke-filled room,\n\nIn the room surrounded by ghould an attempt to kill one of the ghouls i had made stronger the TS pushed while casting Doombolt, this would go on to define the the Character, he managed to kill off the  uberghoul.The result of the Push was the summoning of a greater dæmon, more specifically a great unclean one (rolled a d5 oldest to youngest to determine the god) he managed to barely \"overpower\" the Dæmon burning all of Infamy to do so and came a way with being horribly Bloated by diseases and some influence from the Grandfather after obtaining the key card needed to unlock the door to the Elevator to get to the bridge so that the DMPC could fly them away somewhere safe, \n\nThey encountered Inquisitor Crane and began battling him and his entourage, the TS opened using his first turn to Push again and triggered another Pyschic Phenoma this time a mass Possession by the Tyranid Hive-mind (i know tyranids a basically nulls but dæmon possession twice within an hour seemed like it would get old) all of the PCs failed their willpower test and blacked out when they came out of it the inquisitor and his entourage were slashed apart and torn open and they were sporty some clearly Xenos Mutations (TS had a bone sword which i basicly made a forcesword with the toxic quality while the fleshshaper and PP had their hands replace with rending claws, that gave a -10 to all delicate tasks) and that was how the first session ended.\n\nthe Second session began with the DMPC flying the ship to the nearest planet and while the party handled the Ghoulqueen that was down in the engine room as they wandered down they managed to anger a few Murder servitors but managed with out to much fuss and when they met the ghoulqueen and began to talk to her, they agreed to release he on to the nearest planet (that i described only as 1970's Earth) if she didn't send her army to kill them and so they waited for the ship to reach the planet they were dropped of in 'Africa' to investigate an anomalous energy reading, while there they encountered a largish band of heretic guardsmen encampment and found a mechanicum research facility several miles north. \n\nWhile at the research facility they failed through a series of tech use checks that led to a nuclear meltdown as the fled the facility on the way back they were ambushed by mysterious creatures (lions) and the TS pushed again killing off the last of the lions, this act ended up with the accidental summoning of a bloodletter, after the bloodletter won in the initiative he proceeded to attack the Sorcerer nearly killing him in one turn, the Flesh shaper attacked him with their power spear but barely scratched it , next was the sorcer who fully pushing once more to doombolt the dæmon in the face, doing far more damage than necessary to kill it turning the dæmon to ash and causing his power armor and their radios to malfunction \n\nAfterward they were sent to a large city to gather information And to possibly attempt to start a cult Call in said city the  PP  Was sent out to infiltrate a large festival the town was holding at the time where he met the governor of the city that chief of police and Several members of the community While he was doing this the TS and  Flesh shaper were kidnapping people off with the street and dragging them to their warehouse that they were using as a hide out having grabbed an policeman they proceeded to try to break him using   Mindprobe it resulted in the  TS facing another possession by a  Great unclean one would you survive do so some  terrible rolls on my part after proceeding to break into his mind they discover that he an 2 others were up to become the next lieutenant they sent him home as their sleeper agent. They went out in the night to tracked down one of the two officers and broke down his door and proceeded to kill the man in his home, after this one of them had passed the perception tests i had been making them make and noticed some ultramarines running thru alleys ways caring crates and other objects, \n\nThey decided to ignore this as they tracked down the last officer also at his home though throwing a party, not doing the reasonable thing and waiting until the party is over the TS decided to use his gun for the first time since the beginning of the campaign and attempted to shoot the officer with his, he failed, badly ,,  and hit the side of the house demolishing a wall and a supporting pillar, after this failure the police at the party opened fire on the group, they proceeded to kill 8 off duty police officers and then their target and his family on the may to their escape they began to hear sirens. The PP ended up sneaking away into the night while the Bloated TS bulldozed his way out of their \n\nthe flesh shaper failed both his stealth and athletics rolls to escape and was surrounded by 8 police cruiser and their accompanying officers. and so the flesh shaper he desperate i guess decide to attempt to cast doombolt, (he wasn't a psyker) but i let him roll for it with a -30 as if he was an unbound sorcerer he made it, blowing up a car and causing a psykic earthquake that destroyed the house and ruined the vehicles as he made his escape, on the way back to their hideout  the \"accidental\" terrorist encounter and ultramarine apothecary who saw a battered and wounded running down road and wanted to help them and began a chase that ended with the apothecary catching him and purging them of all the harmful things that had happened to their body\n\nthe next day the party woke up to Cato Sicarius vowing to catch the terrorist and heretics that were plaguing the city and purging them from existence after this the party decided to flee this world with the aid of the DMPC who was Pissed that he literally had to ducttape a few peices of the ship together for the emergency extraction of his ground team\n\nthe next session started with the DMPC chewing out the party for their lack of control and how they were lucky he had enough time to fix the faulty Gellar field generator so they could get to an actual space port, and how he should have spaced them.\n\nafter a few minutes on how the \"fleshies\" messed everything up and how they were lucky he wasn't turning them into servitor on a lack of parts he told them they were being dropped of at the port city and told not to fuck up\n\nin the port city where the party was only meant to make acquistion checks  they decided to explore they discovered all but one shop was being run by a human hive-mind named Dave (i suck at naming things) and the one shop that wasn't sold highly expensive xenos weaponry run by a necron cryptek after attempting to bargain with the Souless machine he made them a deal, bring him 5 eldar farseer soulstones and they could pick one item from their stock, after recieving this deal they left\n\nthe party were continuing to explore the market when the Flesh shaper decided to test an unknown drug on one of the Daves (it was the one  that allowed psykic powers but forced phenoma) this resulted in the possession of one of the Daves by a Keeper of secrets  causing all the other Daves of the hive-mind to start screaming and thrashing on the floor, the party proceeded to use these moments to sate their kleptomaniac tendencies\n\nthe TS stole a few ritual books, the PP stole the fanciest gun in the shop he was in (an exitus rifle), while the flesh shaper grabbed a crate of assorted grenades, and the began running, before they got to far the possessed Dave had a heart attack and the Keeper of Secrets was freed,in a surprise round the TS pushed doombolt and  took all but about 10 of its wounds, the PP  and Fleshshaper used their surprise round to both chuck grenades at it killing it before the end of the round,\n\nthis is where the fifth session ended\n\nThe sixth session started  once more with the party being berated about their Fleshyness and how if he made them servitors it would increase their competence he ended this by telling them that hw was dropping them off at another planet and that if they bucked up in this one they were going to be stranded as he had thing to due and wouldn't be in vox range\n\nhe dropped them off in the underhive  of the largest hive city after disguising the TS as a space wolf (he failed a +30 lore roll to recognize the armor) and left, they proceeded to split up and began looking for a hideout\n\nthe TS decided to go look for an unguarded warehouse, while he found a few they were all rusted out and debilitated, the FS was also looking at warehouse but spoke to the guards(gangers) and was directed to meet their boss at a bar, the PP decided to ask around and found anther ganger who told him that a rival gang was moving in on their turf and to \"clear them out\" the PP found the rest of the party and told them that he found them a place to lay low and all they had to do was \"clear out a neighborhood\"\n\nWhen they arrived in a neighborhood, the TS decided to start the party by using breaking down a door and butchering the family behind it, the gun shots and screams alerted the surrounding buildings about what was happening when they left the house they were faced by the  neighborhood along with the gangers they were sent to kill the party began the slaughter using psykic powers guns and grenades to clear out the crowd \n\nin the end the deathtoll between the three of them was the 10 gangers they were sent to kill 73 civilians killled the summoning and rapid destruction of a bloodletter , and the sundering of the veil surround the neighborhood for around 13 miles\n\nthe party then went to the gangers hide out and rested ending the sixth session.\n\nThe seventh session began with the party learning to have any real effect on anything they needed to leave the under hive, (the PP couldn't make it to this session so he ended up going to a temple for not malal) the TS and FS woke to find that the PP wasn't present so they set off to find a way out of the under hive\n\nthe TS went out looking and asking people how to get out he found a noble who was sent into the under hive for the day as punishment for failing an assassination on his brother and failing to hide the evidence from his father and decided to befriend him and join him when he left\n\nthe FS went out in search of the most guarded area he found an elevator guarded by an armored contingent when he asked how to get on the elevator, he was directed to a large building, (after failing several tests along the way) signs the papers given too him by a heavily scarred man with a pointed hat and black jacket, thus joining the imperial guard and began going thru initiation\n\nthe TS had to track down the  FS and ended up saving the FS just before he is shipped offworld with the rest of the regiment by using the dead inquisitor cranes rosette and claiming it was the TS's\n\nafter this episode the party leaves the under hive and begins to explore the lower hive they stumble on some gang members in red and agree t help them in return for a place to lay low, soon after they stumble upon some blue gang members and a gun fight begins, they both join in  and begin killing the blues with their psykic powers ripping the veil a new one again and  giving every one withing 1km visions of the warp in it's purest form\n\nafter the small turf war over a street the two took the last surviving and unconcious red and blue prisoner and the arbites showed up, quickly hiding the red member the arbites demanded the blue member be handed into their custody, the Arbites proceeded to take the gangmember outside  after they gave him up  and the party heard a gunshot and loud roaring outside as the top of the warehouse they are in is cleaved off, they proceeded outside to see a bloodthirster reeking havoc on the surounding building killing everything in sight\nthe TS decided it was the best time to try even more psykic stuff so he pushed Boon of Magnus and then cast doombolt pushing making his effective PR around 20 or 22 leaving the bloodthirster nearly dead and wounded enough for the FS to doombolt to death, this ended with the TS fighting off a Possession by the Keeper of Secrets from the fifth session, (because he grabbed the dæmons sword before it could dissipate back to the warp,)  while also coving everything near him in frost, He cast away the dæmon \n\nAfter they hightailed it out of there and head further to the hives center where they ended up mind-breaking a random person and used his house as a base, building a ritual room it the basement, in an attempt to summon a dæmon of tzeentch they failed both having to roll on the perils chart the TS ended up being knocked unconscious while the FS had to fight off a Great Unclean one and failed resulting in his possesion\n\nafter waking up the TS discovering the FS possesion made a deal with the GUO to free the FS and to protect them from the Inquisition, in return the GUO would recieve a more permanent host more suited to him, so the TS set out to gather what was need after the outright kidnapping of several people and some less terrible thing he had all he needed and they enacted the ritual with the aid of the GUO, which allowed it to possess the dead and rotting body of a powerful psyker, casting a warpstorm around the planet they are on, and freeing the FS with a mutated slayer arm, metal disease oozing body, and nurgle marked body\n\nthe seventh session ended here\n\nthe eighth and most recent session started with the TS and FS waking up in the house they commandeered, and the PP waking up in a temple  and making his way back to the party where he encounters the GUO doing nurgle stuff in the cellar, after his encounter the GUO he meets up with the rest of the party and they begin brainstorming on how to gain control of the hive\n\ntheir idea is to accuse the nobility of heresy and consorting with dæmons using their own shenanigans and rampant accidental demon summoning as proof, any way while doing this the TS decides to push a mindprobe on the chief arbites, summoning a bloodletter, to kill it the TS pushed a doombolt killing it and causing another peril that summoned the bloodletter back fresh and ready, after nearly dying and killing the bloodletter a second time he reaches out and through the bloodletter as it fades back into the warp and pulls out a blacked and bloodstained collar(i meant this to be for the PP)\n\n the TS decides to break the collar using his force releasing the creature within, a Brass scorpion,and so the party was in combat again, the TS had the FS heal him and pushed the boon of magnus so he could push a doombolt killing the brassscorpion with one spell melting thrugh its hull and demon possessed machinery,\n\nthat ended the eighth session, is this campaign recoverable\n\n::edited for format\n",

Apparently this guy died of some cause, and has a funeral. This is how the adventure starts. Apparently the professor is famous in some city and we were asked to come up with some background as to why we might have known him. Our one clue was that he studied demonology. That's what I built on, considering my character had selected Abyssal as one of his languages.\n\nMy character is different for me. First time playing a War Cleric and a Dragonborn (Silver heritage). Also the first time that I did not line up racials and stats to min/max. For once I wanted to create a character for the character's sake.\n\nSo here is my bid to gain access to the plot element of the professor's funeral with the backstory gambit:\n\nFresh out of his acolyte study in one of the temples of Solanus, Kriv, was on his way to be stationed at a small rural town on the Eastern frontier with a vacancy in the local temple. \n\nThe road was dusty in the beginning, and then turned muddy as the Spring rains came. Kriv noted that most travelers he passed found the rain and wind unpleasant, chilling mostly. Kriv, with his silver dragon ancestry while not uncomfortable, was indeed muddy. \n\nOne morning just before dawn prayers, Kriv heard shouts overhill and down the road a bit. He sprang forth and came upon what looked like a hold up situation. Three bandits had encircled an older man near a wagon. A fifth person lay on the road, face down in the mud some yards off. Sprinting now, and closing to within 30 feet of the older man, Kriv raised his hand and shouted to the highwaymen to clear out.\n\nOne of the ruffians grabbed the old traveler and held a dagger to his throat. The other two turned their attention to Kriv.\n\n\"What's this, a road traveling wyrm? Muddy at that lads!\"\n\n\"He'll stay back and let us conduct our business or this geezer gets it,\" said the assailant near the traveler.\n\n\"The wyrm will stay back, AND the geezer gets it,\" said another as he charged towards Kriv.\n\nPerhaps it was the low light of pre-dawn, or the rain, or the bandits' greed, but they did not recognize Kriv's true nature until the cleric reached for his holy symbol, a pendant of the Sun inscribed with an open palm. \n\nKriv spoke one word: \"Sanctuary\". The dagger wielding hostage taker's hand quavered, and then dropped from the old man's throat. Apparently the road-side ruffian saw the wisdom in not further assailing his first target.\n\nThe other two bandits had no qualms about attacking Kriv. This insolence and encroachment into their territory by even a hand of Solanus would not be tolerated. Just as they raised short swords to cut into this lowly, muddy, inhuman priest, they were met by a blast of frosty air and spittle from the dragonborn. The mist seemed to suck all the warmth out of the air, and from their bodies. One fell. The other was frozen standing for a moment, and then toppled like a statue.\n\nKriv spoke to the remaining bandit in a commanding tone, that surprised even him, \"You will depart this place. The hamlet ahead and all surrounding roads are under my protection now. You will do well to warn your bandit scum to keep far away from here.\"\n\nAt that the highwayman fled, skirting a wide path off road, and then heading in the direction from which Kriv had come.\n\nStill in battle mode, Kriv ran towards the unmoving body in the rutted road. Placing a hand on the victim, Kriv muttered a few words and then lifted the now stirring form. He walked towards the old man who gazed in shock at the scene before him.\n\n\"What can I do to repay you priest?\"\n\n\"I serve Solanus and the light. This is my calling. But some breakfast would be nice, if you have any.\" The stern facial expression of the dragonborn melted into a smirk.\n\nKriv took the time to drag the frozen corpses off the road into the woods. He returned with a small pouch of coins and some rudimentary gear. Chatting around an unusually good fare of food, the travelers exchanged stories. Kriv learned that the old man was a sage, studying the dwellers of the abyss. He asked Kriv what he knew of the broader spheres, and the forces outside of the walking world. Kriv told him of the typical studies of an acolyte and the saying one of his instructors often repeated: \"To defeat your enemy, you must know your enemy\". \n\n\"Ahh\", the sage muttered, \"I can repay you, somewhat beyond this humble breakfast...\" He called to his assistant to fetch his book locker. Reaching in, he retrieved a tome in good condition. This is a primer on 'Abyssal'. It is the guttural language of the lower planes, and demons. If you wish to know your true enemy, you will learn it. I have business in these parts from time to time. Use the months ahead to study. When I travel this road again I will check in on your progress and give you the 2nd installment.\n\nThus began an unlikely friendship between Kriv, cleric of Solanus, and the professor.",

        "text": "(First time poster! Hi!)\n\nFresh from leveling up in the Hall of Truth (the halfling paladin) and the Rogue's Guild in the Freeport Underground (the dark elf rogue), the party is walking past the Jade Dragon Inn and hears a stompin' bar fight going on. Ever on the lookout for new purses to purloin, the rogue heads in, with the paladin along as lookout. \n\nThey see that everyone is fired up, breaking chairs, yelling, and there's a bard in the back singing, even! The paladin figures out he's somewhat responsible, and heads over to see what's up. The bard is joking with his mage girlfriend, clearly having fun with the bar patrons. The barkeep is ignoring -- everything. The paladin asks the bard to stop what he's doing. The bard grins, strikes a new chord, and soon has everyone singing a song of revolution.\n\nThat's enough to draw in the Freeport Militia, who come storming in, restoring order. The mage summons a fire elementalkin and sends it into the fray, but it is soon killed and she gates out. The bard zips out at super speed while the barkeep slips out the back.\n\nThe paladin and rogue decide to come to the aid of the frazzled bar patrons and do a good deal of damage to the Militia before their fight is cut short by the entrance of Commander Drazen, a lieutenant to the infamous Protector of Freeport, Lucan D'Lere. He casts an AE Fear, freezing everyone.\n\nHelpless, the duo are cast into an oubliette in the Sewers, along with everyone else who couldn't get away in time.\n\nThe paladin had some fire beetle eyes from a quest they'd done in a previous session, but instead decided to use an oil lantern she had around. The inky rogue could see perfectly, even in the pitch darkness, but when he saw the diseased rats circling the group, he was more than happy to have lantern light. His suggestion to pour lantern oil on the sewer water and light THAT was shouted down by everyone.\n\nThe paladin heard the sound of splashing coming from beneath the water, and found it was the inflow from the sewer. She poked into the hole with her sword and dislodged an ooze that took everyone in the oubliette to slay.\n\nThe underwater tunnel now clear, the party wondered where it led -- and if they could survive without breathing for so long. So the paladin started ordering commoners into the tunnel at sword point. Where they drowned. Two other commoners (with some fighting skills as demonstrated on the ooze) just elected to forgo the threats and jump in themselves, leaving their fate unknown.\n\nWith everyone else drowned or gone, the party had no choice but to try the path for themselves...\n\nThe adventure was SUPPOSED to have the party deal with the sewer threats and then be hauled to trial at which point they'd be given the next quest. But I was so alarmed at the paladin's actions, forcing the commoners to their deaths, that I decided to run it somewhat differently.\n\nThe sewer went on well beyond the point of no return. They came to a branch with cold, fast running water mixing with slower, warm water, chose the warm water and swam on. \n\nIt was too far; they began taking drowning damage, and the rogue got knocked out. The paladin grabbed him by the belt and swam on, passing out just as she got to the other side of it, a bathhouse drain, where they were seen and rescued.\n\nThe rogue revived and the pair just on the edge of life were brought before the Commander, where they were forced to immediately defend themselves against fomenting unrest in the tavern. They tried to take the high road, but as they tried to blame everyone from the Militia to the bards, in came the two commoners who had jumped into the sewer of their own volition, and they told what they had seen.\n\nThe Commander said they sounded like a good fit for the Militia, and offered them their lives if they would join. Seeing no alternative, they agreed, and were branded with the mark of the Militia and told to settle their affairs and report the next morning.\n\nSet free with a warning to not be late, they headed straight to Marsheart's Chords to confront the bard that landed them in this mess...",

This fails more times than it succeeds, but no failure was more spectacular than that of our very first attempt.\n\nIt's elronds secret meeting, with representatives from all races in attendance, to escort the ring this time, we have three men and one elf, with the ringbearer being a dwarf called fawlkin. They would curve around to the south, head through the gap of rohan while hiding in the shade of the mountains, I don't remember the rest because they never got that far.\n\nThey clumped together and went on foot, going slowly so as to avoid attention, the worst thing they encountered were trolls at night, but aside from that they were making pretty solid progress until they hit day 3. Only one player had bothered to stat his character up with good wisdom saving throws, fawlkin, everyone else had mediocre to terrible saves, with the lowest wisdom score being 5. I kept a record of their wisdom saves and rolled for them all every in game day, all of them failing each time, even fawlkin, who i let roll his saving throw for himself, kept on getting nat ones.\n\nSuddenly, in the middle of the night, all four of the dwarves companions rose out of their sleeping bags and proceeded to brutally murder him in his napsack, only to turn on each other and tear each other to pieces. I didn't even need to make a single roll as the fellowship fell apart into a pile of mushy red chunks. The humans were a fighter, rogue and barbarian, while the elf was a druid, the fight ended as one might expect, with the barbarian slaughtering the others when they had focused on the druid first. He tore the ring from the caved in chest cavity of the dwarf, stuck the ring on and then...proceeded with the adventure, for about two more days before he failed the last two saving throws required to become permanently possessed by the ring of power, going completely insane and charged off into the south west to take over andrast.\n\nTo recap, all of them were boromir, the world is doomed, and they didn't realize that the one ring corrupts everything around it. This campaign lasted exactly one session.",

        "text": "Every now and then a wizard will take the improved familiar feat, obtaining some strange new creature under a certain CR as their new pet. I've seen wizard riding around on bears, using a Cassisian to make a pesudo deathknight and more. But none of those options would do for my dear friend Mike.\n\nHis familiar \\(a vulture\\) had died during the last big encounter, blown to pieces by his own stray fireball spell. So in true chaotic neutral fashion, he didn't give a shit about it's death and spent time trying to acquire a new one. Sadly there were no viable candidates that he wanted in the local area, the only things that were alive after all their murder hoboing were the hirelings they had brought along in order to aid in the excavation of this old mummy tomb. Thats when Mike asked what CR the Blazing Torchbearer alchemist hireling of the party was. I told him he was about CR 3, only three levels in the class, no magic items.\n\nWhile everyone else was celebrating their victory with water and food made by the party druid, Mike dragged Tod off to the side and cast sleep on him, so the guy was out for 8 hours, all the time Mike needed to perform the ritual. He told the others he wanted to sleep by himself tonight and mourn his bird, so they left him alone. Come morning, Mike was significantly happier, and tod felt some compelling force to follow him around. Which was odd considering that Mike had been abusing this poor bastard ever since they hired him, and he continued to do so, only to a less HP reducing degree.\n\nSkipping over some dull stuff, when they got back to the city and fired the other hirelings because they weren't needed anymore, Tod kept on following, bearing his flaming torch day and night. At first the rest of the party thought he just really liked them and wanted to join on, but it quickly became obvious that this wasn't the case when Mike made him charge headlong towards a group of orcs and cast the spell \"self\\-destruct\", a spell he had been working on with me, coating them in his gore, and scorching hot fire, only to come right back a week later, mumbling in horror about the experience.\n\nAs the party got higher in level, they naturally earned more gold, thus any cost to bring Tod back was seen as minor compared to the benefits of using him as a suicide bomber. Tod grew to hate the rest of the group as much as he hated mike, but the spell he was under compelled him to obey every order he was given and he could not actively harm his master, so in order to get his revenge, he'd need to interpret orders in a 'unique way'. \n\nDuring a routine combat encounter against some elementals, he was given the order to protect his master, and took a defensive stance in front of him while also being used as a rest for the party gunslingers rifle. When one of them got close, Tod dropped several explosives, killing himself, the elemental and horrifically wounding the gunslinger. This got the shit kicked out of him when he was brought back, but a point had been made, Tod was sick of their shit.\n\nEvery encounter he found some way to make things a little more difficult for the players, like blinding all of them at the worst possible time, or throwing his explosives while the party were within the radius now and then, little stuff like that which really began to add up. This all came to a head during a bossfight against a linnorm underground, in a place they had been warned specifically not to use explosives. Tod, being the suicidal soul that he was, climbed atop the linnorm and detonated himself after yelling at his master for being a callous, disgusting, cruel asshole who needed to be buried along with this beast. He then killed himself one last time, bringing down the cave. Most of The party was able to escape with only a few nasty chunks of rock smacking into them, Mike did get caught under the rubble however, but didn't die. It was up to the others to decide whether they wanted to dig him out, which they did, and they vowed never to make a human familiar ever again...So he went ahead and got his hands on a brownie, who he called football, the perfect halfpint to kick about.",

        "text": "Thornin was my first true attempt at a chaotic evil character when I was a player, I had tried other alignments, but this was the first, and only time I got to truly let loose.\n\nHis great grandfather had been a test subject for a powerful green dragon long before a pact was signed between dragon kind and the rest of the world, before his ancestor was released, everyone prior to him had been living as test subjects for this powerful acidic beast, who was eventually slain by her own kin after the pact was made. Her taint remained in the bloodline, remaining dormant until Thornin was to be born, where upon all the blood in his mothers body turned to acid and melted her flesh away to reveal a wrinkled baby. He was sold by his father to mages, who experimented on him for years, while also training him, hoping to eventually develop a spell to permanently enslave him and thus make him an effective killing machine. Long story short, he proved to be strangely immune to acid damage, and he was able to eventually escape after pissing off the guard enough to come in and attempt to beat him, which got his face melted off with acid, thus allowing thornin to escape via a window and out into the night.\n\nThe campaign began with the other three party members escorting a caravan into the city, with thornin having crept into the back of one of the wagons some time during transit. When we got into town, the party was warned about people being racist towards 'scaled folk', because one of them was a dragon born, and another was a scaly tiefling, the last one was just a half elf like thornin. thornin ended up heading their way and joining them by pretending to be a new traveler to the place, thus taking the old coach hands advice.\n\nThey got to drinking and talking, well, In thornins case, just talking. They all decided to find a job that the four of them could take together because thornin seemed like a pretty chill dude and they could use some more powerful magic on the team. Though, he insisted that they take another escort job, because he needed to be gone because \\(roll for bluff, nat 20\\) he was getting chased down by a pissed off father and husband of a girl he fucked in the last town he stayed in and wanted to shake them. Thus the band of heroes took the next ready job \\(escorting a lower nobleman to the nearby fortress\\) and prepared to set off the following day.\n\nWhen dawn rolled around, the city was crawling with guards because apparently some 'war criminal' had escaped and was last seen in the area. The guards didn't know what he looked like, only that he was a skilled user of elemental magics. All eyes turn on thornin, who gives them the middle finger in turn and struts down the street, making no attempt to disguise himself as he headed to the nobles house. What better way for a faceless fugitive to hide than by not hiding at all? This actually worked, even letting thornin shift blame from himself, to a pick pocket who tried to steal from him, thus giving the guards a target while he and the rest of the party left the city.\n\nAfter that, the mages proved to be less of a threat, because the party slowly moved further and further away.  Up until then Thornin had been relatively normal as PC's go, very murder hobo. The party never really figured out his alignment, they guessed chaotic neutral or neutral evil, mainly due to the fact Thornin had no issues destroying baby eggs by melting them with caustic acid, or using horrific tactics to murder our enemies. But after one particular scene, they nailed it right on the head. We had just captured a bandit who had attacked a caravan we were escorting \\(we did a lot of escort jobs\\), the rest of his friends were dead and he was knocked out during the clusterfuck. The rest of the party debated on what to do with him, leaving him tied up in the back of a wagon when everyone camped. Meanwhile, Thornin crept into there with him and started to stroke him, constantly casting acid splash, searing away his flesh with every pass as he mumbled screams of panic against his gag. Question after question was asked, the bandit answering every one of them after thornin threatened to burn away his balls and turn them into a puddle on the wood. He told thornin where the camp was, where they kept the loot, his mothers name, his first pets favourite toy and so much more. The guy was called eric osokin, it was a nice name, especially the last bit, so nice in fact, that thornin took his last name before killing him, burning away his lungs by pressing his hand down against the rib cage, melting it away before crushing the meat. He then dragged the dripping corpse and tossed it on the fire to the horror of everyone, not the least bit phased by their reactions. As far as he was concerned, the party could go get some quick cash before the night was up, and poor eric wasn't really that useful to them, dead or alive.\n\nThey convinced the leader of the caravan to hold up and let the party go kill the bandits in order to ensure the trip was safer, which they did, slaughtering them until their leader was knocked out by a sleep spell. Once again, thornin tied the man up in front of everyone and set to work, though with more restraint because the others wanted the leader alive. He told them everything they needed to know, and it only took the disintegration of his left cheek to do it. This was where Thornin got his most valuable tools, a wrist dimension bracelet, and a ring of fear. The Wrist bracelet was like a bag of holding except it could only fit things the character could hold in their hands. The ring of fear was something that had a \"on/off\" switch for an aura of fear, originally the party barbarian had it, but we soon realized that we didn't want people running away from him. It generated a 30ft aura of fear that effected enemies, frightening them as long as they remain within the area after failing a save. We also leveled up after that, and with some close work, the DM and I came up with some more acid based spells.\n\nThe party was attacked again, but this time by more militaristic forces, all wearing a strange, bastardized combo of tiamat and bahamut. They weren't here for a hit and run like the bandits, they wanted everything, including the people. They would have been a threat...If thornin hadn't been storing massive amounts of acid within a 30ft cubed space up my sleeve. Using the fly spell, he floated himself up into the air and declared himself the Searing Tear, He who drenches in acid, The pouring corrosion. The ring was activated and some of the enemy got hit with the status effect before combat started. Thornin began by opening a torrent of acid, using control water to fire it like a draconic breath attack, outright melting four of them in a single move before laughing like a madman. The rest of the party moved in to kill the rest, but some escaped, fleeing in terror from this floating spewer of bile. His title was known, and his reputation began.\n\nThe acid up the wrist trick worked well, but it could be better, as the acid used wasn't that strong and came from constant uses of acid splash, and even at max capacity, i could only use it twice. But with access to spells like dripping armour \\(think armor of agathys, but it deals acid damage and damages weapons that hit it, including magic ones at higher caster levels\\), oozeinator \\(shoots out a thick sticky substance that deals acid damage over time and hampers movement\\) and caustic wall \\(think wall of fire, but acid damage\\), it could be built up pretty quickly, and its potency got better with every spellslot burned to fill it. In the end, we calculated damage based on the number of spellslots burned in order to fill it, as the number of D6 rolled when it was unleashed. \n\nThe group eventually found itself at a city called axys, the 'crossroads of trade', where all cultures and wears mixed in the city state capital. Axys was the place we settled down, as it was independent of the other nations and it was ruled over by ten dragons, so it was pretty safe. The money we had scraped together, we got ourselves a decent house in the copper district. Things were good for a little while, Thornins reputation made for an effective advertising tool, with the rest of the party getting their own nicknames after we took care of a hydra outside the city. However, it didn't last for long, as we were soon brought before the ten dragon council and shown that strange symbol that we had seen on the second bandit group, the same ones i had melted. They questioned us, often pausing to debate telepathically. They eventually made us an offer we couldn't refuse. Join their private police to help deal with this threat known as \"the embers of chromatic light\" or die. If they did join, the party would get discounts, titles, and protection while within the city. All agreed except thornin, who wanted something extra, provided he could do something impossible.\n\nHe wanted them to help him track down the mages who were experimenting on him for years so he could do whatever the hell he felt like to them. But, he wanted to prove he was a match for whatever could be dished out by the enemy, thus inviting 4 of the dragons to hit him with their acidic breath weapons. They paused, conversing again, then agreed. He stripped nearly everything off and 'prepared' himself, by casing dripping armour and the like, making it look like he was buffing himself with acid resistance before suddenly being bathed in potent liquid death. Nothing could have survived it, but he walked out of their attacks unscathed, in fact, better than unscathed. Thornin had always been covered in light acidic burn marks, his hair kept short and stiff, but as he stepped out, the burns were gone and his hair was a thick mane of black hair. DM gave me a charisma boost for being so ballsy, sweet.\n\nEveryone else in the group got something before we were sent to the main building of this draconic inquisition. We were given a detailed run\\-down of the situation, some more gear, and a big list of tasks. The cult itself was trying to bring the dragon gods back, but the dragons on the planet didn't want this because they liked being free willed and not being shackled to some almighty being, even the good dragons wanted to be good in their own way, rather than bahamuts way. \n\nWe maintained our 'cover' as adventurers for hire, expanding our house bit by bit by buying up surrounding property. In the end, the dragon born barbarian making a big fighting pit filled with basic golems i made for him that could be re\\-assembled for nothing once destroyed \\(1 HP, no abilities, just training dummies for him to slap\\). The Tiefling rogue took most of the third floor, turning it into our 'planning room', filled with thread and papers for her theory crafting mind. The Monk orc took the second floor and made it into a really comfy sleeping area, guy was also the cook, so we always ate tasty asian food. Thornin? He took the basement, making it into a lab for himself, it doubled as a torture chamber, with the sewers just on the other side of a wall so dumping bodies was never going to be an issue.\n\nFirst task was to clear our the copper district, our home district, of any of this ember cult influence. It was harder than you might think, since everyone was tight lipped and not willing to point fingers. But the sewers proved to be the key, with thornin sneaking about in them at night and listening to conversations through the grates and under peoples houses. The shit didn't bother him, since it, and the smell were burned away by the caustic acids covering him. One night when a suspect went to the toilet, Thornin dragged him down through the hole after burning away the seat, the tiefling knocked him out and they carried him back to the house. This became the source of information for a while, but eventually we learned that there was one big head honcho we needed to get our hands on. The owner of the local tavern and our favourite place to hang out, the dragon pyre. Our usual tactic wouldn't work, but with a bit of time Thornin burned his way through the walls of the sewer and they gained access to the basement after hours, only to discover that that basement went way deeper than expected.\n\nTo cut a long story short, Thornin made use of a rather situational, but extremely fun spell. Water to Acid, diverting the sewage down the stair well and into the meeting area below, repeatedly casting it while adding his own acidic liquid to the flood. Screams and howls echoed from below, dozens dying in utter agony, with only two men escaping, the tavern owner and an important looking man, having used dimentional door to warp up to us. We took them both back after knocking them out.\n\nIt was obvious the leader wasn't going to talk, even thornins acid trick wasn't working on him, no matter what he burned off. So plan B was put into motion, Plan B involved everyone else leaving the room and promising not to come down stairs for the rest of the night. The big white scaled dragon born yelled at thornin, demanding to be let loose, but he never responded, simply humming a little tune to himself while he prepared a little ritual. A bottle was filled with a strange, glowing fluid, an acid, magical acid, at first the dragonborn scoffed...Until thornin took out a hammer and chisel. his head was strapped down, forced to keep still, the metal cage that thornin locked around him ensured that he couldn't struggle when he started to strike the side of his skull, making a small hole in it, only to pick away the bone fragments and pour the acid inside. Pain like no other surged through him, but no matter how much it burned his body refused to let him die, even as his higher brain functions melted, dissolving his thoughts and memories into a soup, his brain turned into a puddle that started to leak out of his nose. Thornin undid the clasps, tilted his head, and drank what remained. The rest of the night was spent sifting through the memories, picking out those he needed and literally spitting those he did not require out into the sewers.\n\nCome morning, the rest of the party were informed of every last detail thornin had uncovered, the 8 hour ritual of memory consuming was done. The copper district got quieter after that, a number of 'suspected' people vanished. The process was repeated for each district until the other groups noticed that their friends were missing and left, the city council assured the people that the monster which had been eating people in the night had finally been dealt with, and the town guardsmen who managed to stop it were handsomely rewarded with a boost to their budget, though the real reason was to bolster against outside threats and prevent any more of the cultists from getting in.\n\nThornin and the gang had only one last real task after that, kill the cult leader, a three headed mutant dragon, one silver, one black, and one rainbow coloured. It was supposedly the thought to be dead high cleric of Io, the original form of tiamat and bahamut when they were one. The rest of the draconic inquisition was there to provide back up in this assault, which was set to take place at a mountain stronghold, a ruined temple to Io built in the first years of dragons arriving on the world.\n\nTo skip over alot of details, since this post is already getting rather long, the party smashed through the remaining cult members, none of them really standing a chance as the barbarians new axe was a bit too OP \\(vorpal throwing axe of returning\\) and Thornin was just melting people that the barbarian didn't outright kill. Slowly working their way to where this bloated behemoth of a great wyrm was resting. He wasn't at full strength though, old age had set in, he was crushed under part of the temples structure and had been lying there for centuries, all in all, he was getting too old, and it was our job to put an end to his ramblings.\n\nThe guy was made up of three seperate enemies, each head taking a turn with its own legandary actions. The barbarian focused on one, the rogue and monk dealt with the middle one, I got the silver head. But because Thornin couldn't be bothered to fight fair, he decided to end this all very, very quickly. He let himself get eaten, his acid immunity protecting him from the stomach acids, but not the crushing damage of the internal muscles. After a bit of effort, he slit open the gut wall with a spell, climbed out of the gut, and opened the bracelet. He hadn't used this for ages, and the reason why? It was filled with the acidic breath attacks of four seperate dragons, which liquidated the big bad from the inside out. Within the span of three rounds thornin was able to push past the murky ooze that was the dissolving muscle and step out of the pale rib cage, covered in slawing meat and juices. They had won a tough battle that day, and they took the three heads of the old wyrm as trophies.\n\nThe campaign was close to ending, but not without a final gift from the council. They delivered the mages who had tortured thornin, and his own father to their home, in the basement. Thornin just waved the others off, telling them to celebrate in their own way while he had his fun. For the sake of roleplay, we dropped mechanics and went by the rule of cool. The same acidic concoction used to dissolve the dragon borns brain was prepared, one dose for every mage. They were forced to drink each others brain juices, one after another until it was just his father left. Thornin gathered the brain juices in a bowl and drank them all, consuming the memories of twelve people, sifting out everything to do with himself and distilled it into a small vial before vomiting the rest up into the flowing sewer, he then forced his father to drink it, to make him see what he put his own son through for years and years. Normally, I might have let the guy say his side of the story, but not when i'm chaotic evil. The man begged, pleaded for forgiveness, saying he was sorry, and he meant it...he kept pleading even as he was forced to drink thick, mucus like acid that dissolved him down to a pile of sludge. \n\nAfter that, thornin left the house, taking all his belongings with him before setting out to the swamp lands. He got what he wanted, now he just wanted to be left alone, the reputation he had built for himself would be enough to scare even a dragon away.",

        "text": "So I'm DM'ing for a party of 3: A Half-Orc Paladin (who pretends he's human), a Dwarven Cleric (who forgets his own God's name), and a High Elf Wizard (who mostly likes blasting shit with spells.)\n\nThey were clearing out a cave, and came upon a small room built into the cavern, with the ghost of a wizard named Mormesk inside. The room was Mormesk's in life, and he jealously guarded it and all his former possessions as a ghost. He also had a funny French accent and repeatedly proclaimed himself as \"Ze Greatest Wizard Who Ever Lived (until he died), But Still Ze Greatest!\"\n\nThe Half-Orc Paladin tried to sneak past the Ghost to steal from his chest, but the Ghost noticed, and they had to kill it. They all made fun of the Ghost for being super weak after repeatedly proclaiming itself \"Ze Greatest Wizard Who Ever Lived.\" \n\nIn Mormesk's chest, they came across a map, labeled, \"Mormesk's Dungeon\" with directions to his hideout, and promising more treasure to be had.\n\n---\n\nA little later on, they decided to go seek out this dungeon. They found it in the forest, a dark obsidian tower in a perfectly circular clearing with manicured cut grass. A magical mouth appeared at the iron doors at the base of the tower, offering them a bargain: go through the tower, solve the riddle on each level, and at the top you'll find fabulous riches. Also, you'll need to fight some creatures if you fail.\n\nThey all accepted, and went through 3 floors, each time actually managing to solve the riddle, but still having to fight creatures anyway, as apparently the Magic Mouth hadn't explicitly promised them that they *wouldn't* fight stuff if they got the riddles *right.*\n\nThey also noticed that the blood from the dead creatures got absorbed by the tower each time they finished combat, which was weird.\n\nInitially, the Wizard thought there was something magical going on, maybe the creatures were illusory and that's why the blood was disappearing?\n\nBut on the third floor, he finally rolled high enough on Arcana to realize it wasn't illusory: it was for some sort of blood magic ritual.\n\nAs they reached the fourth level of the tower, they saw a ruby amulet in the center of the room, and were given a final riddle:\n\n&gt; There is a ritual of blood\n&gt;\n&gt; To bring the dead back to life.\n&gt; \n&gt; But it requires some adventurers\n&gt; \n&gt; to trick and connive.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once it is completed, \n&gt; \n&gt; ALL WILL COME TO FEAR\n&gt; \n&gt; ZE WORLD'S GREATEST WIZARD \n&gt; \n&gt; WHO IS NOW BACK TO DOMINEER!\n&gt;\n&gt; WHO AM I?\n\nAs the words were being said, the blood of all the previous encounters rolled up the walls and arced over them, forming into a humanoid shape with the ruby amulet in the center. \n\nMagical energy crackled, and in the center of the room, **Mormesk**, now in the form of a Lich, was reborn.\n\n---\n\nToo late, the High Elf Wizard recalled from his days as a student the warnings of his teacher to be wary of the bargain to bring a Lich back from death:\n\n1) The Lich must convince 3 non-evil creatures to enter into a bargain with it.\n\n2) The 3 non-evil creatures must commit 3 separate blood sacrifices to the Lich, including at least one creature the Lich loves (in this case, his beloved bird, which was a Peryton.)\n\n3) Everything the Lich says to convince the non-evil group to enter into the bargain must be strictly true.\n\n---\n\nAnd so, the Lich quickly mopped the floor with them, although he didn't even bother to kill them and simply Dimension Door'd away.\n\nBut, after licking their wounds and resting up for a bit, the adventurers ascended to Level 5 of the tower, and discovered the words of the Magical Mouth were in fact strictly true: at the top of the tower was a chest with 10,000 GP in it, the \"fabulous riches\" they had been promised they'd find if they completed the bargain.\n\n---\n\nSo now the party is considerably richer, but on the other hand, they have now accidentally released an evil Lich into the world, and will have to figure out a way to fix their mistakes before the Lich manages to imperil the world as they know it.\n\nAlso, they learned maybe not to blindly trust maps inside of chests that literally promised adventurers gold if they went there.",

        "text": "I like to make it a habit of getting my players a base of operations. It makes for better roleplaying and it stops them from becoming wondering murder hobos. Normally it's just a matter of becoming well known, or buying it with their money once they hear of a decent place, or taking over an abandoned fort. But a player derailed an entire campaign just because he refused to deal with his neighbor.\n\nThis was a pretty chill campaign, with the players working up from lowly outcasts, to respected nobles within the nation after having done many great deeds and favours to the king. They ended up landing a swanky manor, much to the pleasure of the parties bard, who was a disgraced nobleman from a neighbouring kingdom who got kicked out during a rebellion. Now he was living in the lap of luxury again, and was getting a monthly salary from the king in exchange for going out and doing heroic things in his name.\n\nBut then there was lord and lady numenstrall, the thorn in his side. These two were snooty assholes who were vastly wealthy due to their ownership of vast amounts of farmland and the mines of a particular mountain. They didn't really care about the other players, just the bard. They eventually learned that the numenstralls \\(henceforth referred to as the numens\\) had benefited from the rebellion in the other nation because they got lots of new workers who came across the border, making them even more wealthy.\n\nThing is, the numens were just assholes, not evil. They didn't have any slave labour and just worked their employees very hard. Their biggest offense was being rude to the bard, like not inviting the party to a private ball, or making up nasty rumors. Ultimately harmless stuff, but still annoying. My original plan was to have them eventually come around to the heroes, or be saved by them and end up being an odd ally later on. This was set in place until the bard decided he had had enough of them and orchestrated a scheme to get some petty revenge.\n\nThe numen's were going to have another grand party \\(the players not invited\\) and give away prizes to the guests if any of them could solve some of the puzzles the had. The entire thing was a masked ball, so sneaking in wasn't hard. The bard went in with the wizard, who had been dying to use his familiar for something other than a touch spell homing missile. The rest of the party...weren't there, because one was sick, the other had to go to a family thing. The bard wormed his way through the place, chatting up everyone with an ear to lend while the wizard used his familiar to pick pockets and prepare the way to the off limits section of the house. They already had a detailed plan of it after sending the familiar into the place over the course of a week, making a map of it which they used as reference.\n\nThey were not merciful in their theft. Stealing everything that wasn't bolted down in the off limits sections of the house, stuffing what they could into bags of holding before moving on to a new section, slowly picking the place clean while guards kept watch of the other guests. Every time they met one? The bard hit them with charm person, or suggestion, letting him walk by with ease. When that failed, the guy had enough bluff to beach a school of whales. They left the party soon after, just as the guards did their rounds and noticed that pretty much everything not nailed down was gone.\n\nThus began the legal battle between the party and the numens. It wouldn't have happened at all if the bard hadn't tried to openly sell some of the stolen goods, or display some of it in their home. The main plot was put on hold while the party had to tamper with evidence, bribe people and at one point, drug a member of the jury and replace them in order to get out of being sent to jail and have everything they owned stripped away. The numens got the last laugh though, as they were able to use their wealth to buy the manor the players owned right out from under them, dumping them in the streets...with twice the money they had when they first used to obtain the manor in the first place. This was my unsubtle way of saying \"it's time to move house, no more numens.\"\n\nThe party bought a run down castle in the countryside and we time\\-skipped so the money they spent on it could be put to good use, with the players designing the entire thing together as a group project...But they had a decent amount of money left over, and messed with the numens one final time. They blew a chunk of it on one of the mining deeds for a mountain and hired some miners to work on it, thus generating them a bit of income every in game week. But they did this specifically so they could carve a picture of lady numen getting fucked by a horse on the cliff face, and there was nothing that could be legally done by the numens to change it.",

        "text": "A few months ago, we were running Curse of Strahd, and although parts of it were changed/homebrewed so that it was a shorter campaign (barovia was basically a large side quest so that a different friend could DM) we went through a lot of the major plot points.\n\nWe had gotten to the Festival of the Blazing Sun, and we were hoping to create a situation where we could deal with The Burgermeister and Fiona Wachter at the same time. We had paperwork proving Fiona worked for Strahd, and we personally knew the Burgermeister was corrupt, so we wanted to have both meet their fates (although we would have been okay with just removing the Burgermeister) in one fell swoop.\n\nMy Paladin (whose deity is a sun-themed Phoenix) was asked to light the ceremonial orb with his Flametongue sword, so I was up on the stage with The Burgermeister and Irena (I’m not sure how CoS is supposed to go, but Irena in our campaign was protected from Strahd and had regained certain memories and became be mouthpiece for our liberation group against Strahd?). The last thing we expected was an assassination, as one of Fiona’s lackeys was unseen by our perception checks and publicly killed the Burgermeister after I lit the wicker orb.\n\nFiona came up on stage, said something about it being to late, and initiative started. I immediately killed her and launched her body off stage with a thunderous smite. My allies dealt with the assassin.\n\nUnfortunately we had earlier failed a side quest that would have continued to protect Vallaki from Strahd, because she (Strahd was gender-swapped, which was actually pretty interesting!) waltzed right through the scared crowd to approach us. We had routinely gotten our asses kicked by Strahd, but now we had the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind and had made a new allies (we had another PC join us for this arc, and by being very lucky we actually captured and cured a past PC of vampirism, so one player had two characters).\n\nA fight against Strahd and many, many wolves and vampire spawn began, and we were actually doing better than usual. Eventually Strahd started to be on the ropes, and teleported to the roof of a nearby building to watch us all struggle against her creatures.\n\nStrahd didn’t account for our Monk, who ran right up the wall of building and tried to one-on-one fist fight her. A bad decision, to be sure, but still Strahd was looking pretty bad and would be escaping at any minute. The Druid bringing down a call lightning spell on the rooftop spire to strike Strahd while she fought our Monk was a particularly cool image.\n\nStrahd knocked our Monk unconscious, and threw his body off the roof. Looking rough for us right?\n\nOur Cleric was holding on to the holy symbol of Ravenkind. In a desperate move, we hoped the sunlight could do something to stop Strahd from escaping, but we doubted it. Strahd’s turn was coming up, presumably her last in this battle, but our Ranger could still have a go.\n\nFrom the ground to the roof of the building provided Strahd with 3/4 cover, but our Ranger managed to hit Strahd right in the eye, down to 0 hit points.\n\nOur DM forgot that we just used the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind.\n\nWhoops, campaign over prematurely and abruptly. Pretty awesome fight though! We had the rest of the session be a kind of celebration in Valliki, and my Paladin has developed a older-brother type relationship with Arabella (she was basically portrayed as Wednesday Addams, and the Vistani camp she called home was abandoned/destroyed so she was on her own) so he went to say goodbye to her on his own, and we then managed to leave Ravenloft.\n\nThere’s still more to do there one day, I’m sure, but I thought that my DM was very fair in accepting that his BBEG died much earlier than anticipated, and rewarded our battle skills with a fairly happy ending. Just wanted to share it.",

        "text": "Hello everyone! I love collecting 'old' roleplaying games and/or accessories and one such find that I made recently was [Grimrock Isle](https://i.imgur.com/K3AHQmO.jpg) by Triad Entertainment and licensed through Chaosium. It's a really unique little product, a whole campaign surrounding this sleepy Maine town covered across a number of [sub-booklets and over thirty handouts](https://i.imgur.com/ovGKswl.jpg). The real kicker is the solo adventure, which the game instructs you to play before reading anything into Dove's Bay. It plays sort of like a Choose Your Own Adventure except with more crying and sanity loss. Taking the rules to heart I decided to play the solo adventure, but made a few tweaks. The scenario is technically set for August of 1922, but I 'updated' it seventy years to August of 1992 and used Cthulhu Now to create my character, Federal Agent Isaac Catlow. I kind of picture him as [Lee Marvin](https://assets.mubi.com/images/notebook/post_images/25574/images-w1400.jpg?1522357018).\n\nThe following is his tale, uncensored and untold until now! Enjoy!\n***\n**FBI evidence file EX7M751SD. Small tape recorder, foreign make. Light scratches and dents. Crack on front. Fingerprint markings identify Isaac Catlow. Approximate run-time, 00:04:33:95. Transcript as best follows.**\n***\n\n***August 3rd, 1992. 9:00AM***  \nAlright. Okay. [*heavy breathing*] Is this thing on? Damned technology. Alright, hello? Jane, I'm finally using that recorder you bought me for Christmas, I hope you're happy. This is more for posterity than anything. I know most think I'm crazy, but this should show them all. I've just entered Dove's Bay. I'm sure you noticed I didn't take the car, too easy for them to track. I've taken train/buses/taxis all the way up here. My taxi driver didn't have much to say about this sleepy little coastal town, but made a face like when you tried to give Victoria that spinach when she was four. [*laughter*] Anyway, I'm going in to meet my contact, this real estate agent named Tobias Armbrewster. What a name right? [*mumbling*] He owns the house Jane, the one in my dream. I've got to get to the bottom of this. I love you. [*click*]\n\n***August 3rd, 1992. 9:15AM***  \nOkay, alright. Spoke with Armbrewster. I got the key to the Grim House and $850 expense money. [*shuffle*] Oh yeah, he thinks I'm one of those paranormal investigator types right? That's how I reached out to him once I found out that my dream house, more like nightmare house, was real and in Maine. I've got a place here, at Gordon's Motel. Gotta check in. This place isn't so bad, maybe we can vacation here someday? Bring Victoria too of course, though she may be too old to want to be seen with her old man now. [*click*]\n\n***August 3rd, 1992. 9:30AM***  \nHeading into the Motel now. Looks like it was once a manor house or something, you see a lot of that fancy old architecture around here. Looks like the rich love to vacation here. [*click*]\n\n***August 3rd, 1992. 9:45AM***  \nGot everything sorted out with Mrs. Gordon. What a sweetheart, tiny little thing. Paying $85 for the week, hopefully I can get stuff wrapped up in that time. So Armbrewster was saying that the house was built by Lazarus Grim over on Grimrock Isle in the bay. What a pleasant named man for a pleasant named place huh? [*shuffle*] Grim was killed by some sort of lynch mob back before the Civil War and the house got burnt. It's been sitting there for over a hundred years now, just looming and rotting. People say they see lights and hear noises and other such nonsense, but it plays into my dream. Armbrewster wants the thing 'cleared' so he can sell it. Heck, maybe I'll find a way to buy the thing if it'll give me closure [*laughter*][*click*]\n\n***August 3rd, 1992. 10:00AM***  \nGonna be quiet because I'm entering the library. Charles Public Library. Hope I can dig up some stuff on this place, possibly even on Grim. [*click*]\n\n***August 3rd, 1992. 10:30AM***  \n[*click*][*mumbling*][*click*]\n\n***August 3rd, 1992. 11:00AM***  \n[*click*]\n\n***August 3rd, 1992. 11:30AM***  \n[*click*]\n\n***August 3rd, 1992. 12:00PM***  \n[*static*] and that' why I can't find anything I think, this organization is awful. Know what else is a little screwy? I looked up from my table and saw some figure in the window peering at me. Then it was gone. Strangest thing. I miss you Jane. [*click*]\n\n***August 3rd, 1992. 12:15PM***  \nHeading over to the Sheriff's office, maybe I can find some old files or something. I don't want to let on about me though, so I'm not gonna be able to pull any of my federal weight around. I left my badge at the motel anyway. [*click*]\n\n***August 3rd, 1992. 12:25PM***  \nMet with Sheriff Ekhart. What a lovely man. Har. He didn't take too kindly to me requesting access to records. I really don't want to get the bureau involved in this Jane. I'm gonna have to try elsewhere. [*click*]\n\n***August 3rd, 1992. 12:40PM***  \nStanding outside Enos Wade's Boat Rental now. What a crusty old salt. But hey, this place has been a fishing village for centuries really. Guess I can trust him. Gonna take a ride over to Grimrock Isle itself and come back before night. The man is eccentric and his prices might be a bit ridiculous but if this whole thing works out... [*click*]\n\n***August 3rd, 1992. 12:55PM***  \nAlright, here we go. Heading over now. [*click*]\n\n***August 3rd, 1992. 1:25PM***  \n[*engine*]Made it over safely. Boy did old Enos like to talk, but maybe some of my gentle prying helped. He's got a lot of stories about Grimrock Isle alright. When he was a kid some friend of his was taking a lap around the bay and heard some sort of call for distress. When they went to investigate they hit a rock where there wasn't supposed to be any. Enos said that he helped his friend check the hull and found four slash marks on the structure. Like, claw marks Jane. Weird. He also said that some college kids went missing about a year or so ago, he rented them their boat. [*shuffle*] It was found on the island but neither of the kids have been seen since. No signs of struggles or bodies. Enos says that the house 'ate them'. His words, not mine honey. That's why the man charges so much to go over here, he's afraid of the isle. Enos is taking off now, I've got to light some lantern or whatever to signal him back. [*click*]\n\n***August 3rd, 1992. 1:30PM***  \nThis place feels weird Jane. I hate to say evil, but it's like some oppressive mugginess on my soul. The dock is covered in mold, old Enos was right...nobody comes here. There was a fork in the path, I chose right. I hope that's right [*laughter*]. I'm near some outcropping on the edge of the island. Some old tower up ahead, gonna check that out. [*click*]\n\n***August 3rd, 1992. 1:35PM***  \nI don't know if I'm as strong as I used to be hon. This door is pretty badly warped with age. I might try to shoulder it open. [*click*]\n\n***August 3rd, 1992. 1:40PM***  \n[*heavy breathing*] Ow. That door isn't gonna move. Well, better go around back an- [*click*]\n\n***August 3rd, 1992. 1:45PM***  \n[*muffled crashes*][*shout*][*click*]\n\n***August 3rd, 1992. 1:50PM***  \n[*heavy breathing*] Well that was goddamned embarassing. Grown ass FBI agent falls down stairs. Dammit, think my ankle is gone bad now. I'm not young anymore hon. [*sigh*] Gonna continue down that path towards the interior.[*click*]\n\n***August 3rd, 1992. 1:55PM***  \n[*heavy breathing*] Found a well in a clearing, that must be something.

        "text": "Family is a sacred thing at my table. I will occasionally mess with player characters families, but those who openly invite that kind of interaction to my table do so at their own risk, and benefit. I avoid killing them, or corrupting them, because with them alive and well, they provide some of the strongest crutches for roleplay any character can have. Even the most staunch of paladins can have their steely heart cracked when applied correctly.\n\nThis all took place over the course of a simple campaign, mostly for fun at first, starting out as your standard \"Kill the big bad\" campaign with all the tropes included. They were an assembled group of motley heroes who had to collect shards of a holy relic in order to stop the dark lord, while keeping his dark relic away from him and his minions. The relic in question was a locket that none of them could open, and while the dark lord seemed extremely powerful without it, no one wanted to see what would happen if he got his hands on his most precious and prized possession. They gave it to the guy with the highest Wisdom of the group, so he'd have no trouble resisting and attempts to scry him, the artifact or any possession attempts. This guy was Sire Wilfred silbersmith, a paladin of a homebrew god I made called Noael, the early dawn. Noael was a new god of justice, humanity, veal and honour, but he was also a god of arrogance, though few knew that was an actual domain of his.\n\nWilfred was a knight in the traditional sense, he did have a lord, he did own land, and he owned a decent house with a loving family. They were brought under the protection of the Crimson emperor Hertzfeldt so that he would not need to worry about him while going on his quest. Though, one thing he did note throughout most of the adventure was that the dark lord, for all his evil reputation and cruel history...never attempted to make war against Gridamas after waking up from his long overdue revival. \n\nLots of things didn't add up when they thought about it, which they hadn't bothered to do until much later in the campaign. Most of the relic pieces they were gathering killed or tainted anyone who tried to touch it, and only Wilfred seemed able to handle them without issue. They deduced the locket was the source of this protection, but not why. The game had been taking place for an in game year by that point, yet there had been no swarming army of undead as the high cleric of the church of man had warned, or anything that was foretold in the prophecy of the dark lords return. In fact, most of the things they fought were actually unrelated threats, like a cult of dark giants who used the shard to pass between rifts into the shadowfell, or corrupted fae creatures. They did fight undead now and then, but not the kind they had come to expect from me. Normally undead are creatures of fetid meat and palid bone, some perverse twisting of life into an unholy structure. But every undead they fought that the dark lord sent were sentient, singularly strong and careful.\n\nThey first caught on to the fact that something was amiss when one of the dark lords minions, who had gotten a hold of the relic fragment \\(which they had pieced together was a black mirror\\), had not ran when they pursued him. He was desperate to talk, on behalf of his master. Despite the fact he was undead, the only thing that gave him away was a pale colour in his eyes and the relatively sunken in skin of his cheeks. He told the party that if they handed over the locket, just the locket and nothing else, his master would grant them one single wish before committing suicide. The first bit they expected, but the latter knocked their jaws to the floor. The servant refused to reveal more than that, but told them that if they wished to make this deal, they had to reach a specific spot within the northern mountain ranges within three days, and to come by themselves. The only other condition was to keep the locket safe. As a sign of good faith, the servant gave them the shard he had and left in a puff of smoke.\n\nThis was seen as an obvious trap, but the offer of the dark lord, a figure feared in fairy tales as a grand and powerful necromancer who had killed thousands in his home city in an attempt to master the dark arts, only to fail at becoming truly immortal and descend into lichdom, offering to kill himself? None of them bought it, but none of them could figure out why he would put something like that on the bargaining table. They guessed the locket was his phylactery, and that the relic they were slowly constructing was powerful enough to destroy it. But then why give them a shard to aid in it's destruction? These questions and more buzzed inside their head for a long time after the session ended, they even had me sit in on some discord chats while they discussed it.\n\nIn the end, they went to meet with him, leaving their shards within a vault back at the capital while they went on only with the locket. For three days they marched...and for three days they encountered nothing but calm skies and quiet landscapes. This would have been fine, if they hadn't gotten used to me rolling on the random encounter chart during every traveling expedition they made. Not even the great dragons could be seen in the sky, so alone were they in a world that had once seemed so full of life. Even their final leg of the journey proved uneventful, a very disturbing turn considering that the mountains had a reputation for housing horrific beasts. They found the spot described to them and set up camp for the night, and with the moon looming high in the sky, a stranger dressed in black sat down at their campfire, a skinny thing with spidery hands and dry, pale skin. Without any pomp or grandure, the dark lord, the arch lich of the world, started to warm himself beside them.\n\nConversation was tentative, starting with a simple \"how was the trip, I hope nothing bothered you on the way.\" Wilfred eventually broke the uneasy but gentle conversation with a callous bellow, threatening to destroy the necklace if the lich did not get down to business. That...made the lich shiver with panic, almost reaching up to stop him, but withdrew himself slowly. The deal was simple, the lich wanted the locket, with it in hand, he would open it and release whatever was inside before killing himself. But before doing that, he would grant the the players access to a powerful item of his own, a genie lamp, but this one was special. The genie inside had been subjected to a thousand mental tortures throughout its existence, to a point where it was broken and submissive to its master, granting any wish it commanded when able. The lich mentioned it was still on cool down though, as the last wish had been used to guarantee the safe travel of the party until the genie regained access to its miracle granting power.\n\nWilfred's god, a violent aggressor to all that offended him, commanded that he smite the lich for being a fool and a snake. The lich took the blow without even trying to avoid it, looking him dead in the eye as holy energy pulsed through his form. Wilfred tried again, and again, the lich telling the others to not interfere as Wilfred hit him repeatedly with biting blade. I let him get the lich down to about fifteen HP before he asked \"what would you be willing to do if you're loved ones were dead or dying, and you had a chance to save them?\" Wilfred responded by saying he'd do anything, the lich nodded and smiled through the pain he experienced.\" Then you and I are very alike.\" He then told them all his story.\n\nHe had been a mage in training, as well as a member of the guard in a city long forgotten to history. He had a wife, a women he loved dearly. But one day she got sick and started dying, so he prayed to every god he knew, but none answered, not even asmodeus. When she passed away, he vowed to save her soul in a way only a man of magic could. He took to black magic in secret, studying necromancy in an attempt to save her. This lead to some murders so he could test his skills on fresh corpses, slowly developing a method by which he could bring someone back to as close to life as an undead could be, but it needed the soul, something he did not possess. So, in a ritual to try and bring her soul back to this plane, he put everything he had into it...but was found out by the town and they lynch mobbed him mid rite. The failure resulted in his own body and soul being scarred, turning him into a similar undead that he himself had developed, with the added benefit of being able to regenerate at a set point of his chosing by making a ritual circle. But if his body were to die within it? Well, he guessed that would be the end. The other benefit was that his wife's soul was stuck within the locket he had intended to be her vessel until giving her a new body. However, as the town killed him, a mage made sure to curse the locket, preventing him from ever touching it without it being given to him. \n\nSkipping over more of that backstory, he realized the error of his ways long ago, and only wished to open the locket, let his wife free and then be with her, or at least get one final chance to speak to her before going to hell where he belonged. This is where Noael tried to influence the paladin again, telling him to simply kill the lich, keep the locket, keep using it to collect the mirror shards and put the completed artifact to good use. It was then the god revealed the power of the artifact to all of them. It was a portal to ravenloft, one the lich had made in an attempt to contact the greatest lich of all, vecna. \n\nIt was then the party had to choose, did they trust the lich enough to not lie and keep his word? Or did they want to follow the commands of a young upstart god, who was lawful good \\(or lawful asshole if you prefer\\), and damn the lich to an eternity of suffering in the realm of ravenloft after collecting the shards. The third option was to use the mirror to maybe destroy the locket, or just kill the lich outright, as he had revealed his own weakness to them. In the end, Wilfred wanted to do something before making his choice on the matter.\n\nHe asked the lich if he knew the teleport spell, which he did. His god demanded to know what he intended to do, demanding that he killed the lich right there and then...He denounced his god, smashing his holy symbol against the stones, severing his connection with Noael. He told the others what he wanted to do, he wanted to speak to his family, he wanted to figure out something for himself. They all agreed to take some down time, and the lich warped them back home, telling them that he'd keep a watch out for a sign that they wished to return and discuss things more. Wilfred went to his wife and child, and while the scene with him was kept short, it confirmed his new beliefs. \n\nHe and the party soon found themselves with the lich again, this time it was within his home, a cozy place built inside a mountain that housed his undead servants and himself. Though they noticed that none of the servants really seemed unhappy, most were glad to have a second chance at life, and the debt they owed their master was a small price to pay, insight checks revealed that they weren't lying, magic checks revealed it wasn't any kind of control.\n\nThe conversation was kept short, they had agreed to give the lich what he desired, but wilfred was the one who had pushed for that choice the most. Wilfred took off the necklace, and handed it over to the lich, who in turn thanked him with a warm hug...then cast finger of death, killing Wilfred instantly, opened the locket and shoved the eyeball of vecna into his empty socket \\(he had used illusions to make it seem like he had two eyes\\), and used the boost in power and his minions to kill the other players in an extremely one sided fight.\n\nNever trust your GM, especially when he knows exactly how to play you like a fiddle. To recap, I made a paladin denounce his god, give the dark lord the thing he desired most of all, and gave him access to the minds and bodies of 4 people who had extensive knowledge of the capital. For those of you wondering how I pulled this off, never, ever underestimate the power of the lich bard with a cloak of charisma. Practically everything he said to them was a lie, except the curse about him not being able to get the locket without it being willingly given.",

        "text": "The party had just suffered the loss of their barbarian, specifically, a zealot barbarian. They were at a level where resurrection was possible, but it required that they had the entire body in order to fully restore them to life. But as they had lost seventy percent of her to the stomach acids of a wizards mad experiment that vomited its own guts out as an attack, they were not in a position to really bring them back. Then the cleric, a cleric of the goddess of undeath, decides to tell the barbarian player to not roll up a new character, because he had a plan.\n\n The setting they were in was very Conan, lots of pyramids, massive slave empires, blood and guts everywhere, the usual stuff. One of these empires had a similar concept to the terracotta army, except they brought it back to life whenever their country was under threat, which was literally an army of long dead, very strong barbarians who could surge across the land and murder anything. The party had just done the emperor of this empire a favour by ridding him of that meddlesome mage who had been summoning abominations into his realm, and thus granted them a boon in the form of a temple devoted to the clerics god, which served as their home base.\n\nThrough careful planning, they snuck into these ey olde tombs, using undead to trigger traps and the like before chopping off parts of these sacred warrior corpses, doing so in a very hap hazard manner before stuffing them all into a sack. This did bring them into conflict against the one zealot barbarian who wasn't dead that protected the place, but after they froze him solid and smashed the ice block, they took the frosty chunks along with them.\n\nBack at base, they pieced this body together, one grisly chunk at a time. I had them roll as if they were making a flesh golem once i realized what they were doing, stitching it all so that it held tight, only to place their fallen friends arm, head and a quarter of his torso onto the mish\\-mashed body of adozen other warriors. The cleric tried to resurrect him, calling upon the powers of death, life and undeath to give power to this unholy abomination, the corrupt magic sealing the stitches, making it all into one miss matched whole.\n\nThe barbarian player had been gone for a few sessions, because while he wanted to continue playing, he trusted the cleric to do something crazy, but didn't want to waste his time sitting about waiting for it to happen. The next session started with me handing him the new character sheet, the two biggest questions on his mind was how he somehow counted as both undead, and a living humanoid. The second being why his base stats were so very different. Both were answered when we started the session, with franken\\-barb stepping off the slab, now imbued with dark magic and the knowledge of memories that were not his own.\n\nHis stats had been shifted so that he had basically no charisma and a big reduction in dexterity. But a crap ton of wisdom, strength and constitution, I also noted down that he couldn't feel intense sensations, among other things. Needless to say, the guy was overjoyed, horrified, confused and happy to go along with it. With their newfound wrecking ball of flesh, the party had some fun combat encounters, but rp wise, franken\\-barb pulled no punches when it came to how depressed and shitty he felt all the time, or his speech impediment, that being a case of the rolling r's and groaning g's.\n\nTo skip over alot and get to the good stuff, he survived for a very long time as franken\\-barb, long enough for the cleric to gain access to more powerful resurrection spells which would allow for him to be restored completely. While he loved the extra boost to physical stats, the guy went for the proper RP response and decided to let himself be killed and resurrected in his whole, original body. So they tried it, and...He came back as franken\\-barb once again. He had been in that body for so long, his soul had assumed that shape, shifting to match the body it inhabited, it's old image left behind.\n\nThe party's goals didn't shift much, because they didn't want him to be anything other than their pet flesh golem, but as you can imagine, the character was depressed, even calling upon his god of war to save him. But his god wanted him this way, to be a better fighter, a greater killer. He should not look at this gift as if it were a curse, for he was mightier than ten men. After that, franken\\-barb truly embraced his suicidal class tendencies, disregarding his own safety at every turn, only to be brought back time and again as this monster.\n\nThe player of the barb and I had talked in private about what should be done, in the end, I gave him three choices. Eternal death, where the barb would die and never return after the next death, having truly come to hunger for permanent rest. The favour of a god, where in he manages to get another god to grant him the boon, shifting him back, but at the cost of pissing off his patron. And then there was option three...\n\nThe rest of the party were seen as heroes, he was their lumbering beast, he was the strongest of them all, but the most feared and to some degree, hated. His sorrow and self loathing became the source of his rage, but soon, even that died. The barbarian lost the ability to rage, he couldn't even feel anything else but self loathing, so intense was it, and so dulled were his senses. One day, the rest of the group found him missing, with only a note left behind, detailing his final farewell.\n\nThe barb had left, heading off into the night. Food and water were no longer needed, the unholy energy within him sustaining his immortal body, he could no longer tire, for he felt no strain, all he felt was the need to be himself again, not this monster of a thousand other memories. He returned to the tomb which the players gathered his body parts, ripping himself apart bit by bit, putting the limbs back onto the long dead fighters, his will to return them and to be rid of them was so strong he didn't even notice when he died, nor that his own soul was the thing removing the limbs until all that was left was his head and arm.\n\nHis soul passed on the moment he noticed, but instead of landing into the vengeful clutches of the war god, seeking to make his weapon of war pay, he found himself cradled by angels, taken to heaven. His deeds had all been selfless, even after he had been put in such a horrific body, his soul was found to be reborn and pure. He died a noble soul, even after all that had happened to him, his suffering set him free.\n\nThe moral of the story? Don't agree to let your cleric experiment with the DM's boundries of resurrection, he will allow strange things to happen. ",

The town is now occupied by a group of goblins, hobgoblins, and other “monster races”  known as the crimson raiders or crimson reds. My plan was to take the town and storm it since it was small and ours to begin with. The plan we decided on was to take over a merchant’s carriage and enter the town. The bard and alchemist drove the carriage and the rest rode in the back in crates. Guards were bribed not to inspect the stuff but asked for two crates as a tariff. One of them contained me. It was growing dim and I was taken into the town hall where I asked what time it was expecting myself to be with the party still. The crate was dropped, I popped out and said “We’re bandit exterminators” like the guy from futurama saying “we’re owl exterminators” because the original plan we were giggling about was sitting in the back as guards who would say that in unison if seen. I immediately cast scorching rays to hit them and a nat 1 caused the spiral staircase me and the enemies were on to drop, I then proceeded to blink out before the staircase collapsed while the survivors thought about the weird jack in the box they just experienced.\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/8iiud7/pathfinder_when_one_guy_cant_play_more_than_his/",
        "text": "I know that some people like to use the same character for every campaign they go through, whether it's their first character, or maybe one they are particularly fond of. I myself have reused a few characters on occasion, but it can be a bit unhealthy when you are devoted to the same guy and refuse to play anyone else.\n\nTake a friend of mine, we'll call him Jeff. He was a relatively new member to the group, been with us for about six months, and had taken part in two campaigns up until that point, on the second one, he used the same dude, modified slightly to fit the new setting I made after the last one got destroyed by genie and fireball nukes. I signed off on it after we set it back to level one, then got on with the session zero so the other guys could get their people sorted out.\n\nNext campaign was a standard mega dungeon affair, the whole idea being that there was this moon you could travel to that was one giant ruined city, with the party bouncing back and forth between it and the planet. It was pretty chill, they got to fight some cool monsters, claimed a section of it as their forward base, and even managed to free a millennia old elf from cryo stasis. But the most relevant event was when they fought the Chosen Band, a group of asshole adventurers who wanted to kill them for their loot.\n\nThey got one of the party, jeffs character. Guy actually cried a little over it, again. As this was the second time this character had died at my table, the other time being at the very end of the other campaign in an epic boss fight. But unlike that time, His character died like a bitch, getting stabbed in the back as he tried to step away. This led to jeff sorta...going quiet for a week, then showed up with a new character, a female necromancer. She was a \"revenge character\", but not one of 'those' kinds of revenge characters. He specifically had her so she could resurrect his previous character. It's such a shame that he seemed to forget that wizards can't learn resurrection.\n\nSo he was stuck as this femmy necrophiliac for a while, but he soon got it into his head to pretend as if she was speaking to his prior characters soul all the time, even talking me into letting him get the speak with dead spell for her just so he could keep using his dude. It actually got pretty creepy, especially when he'd force the others to keep calling him by his previous dudes name and not his new characters. He even started using her like him, despite the fact she was really unsuited for close combat.\n\nIn the end, I had enough of this behavior and called in the psychopomps. These creatures are servants of the goddess of death and perform various tasks relating to organizing, collecting and the passing on of souls. In order to explain the stuff he was pulling I had the soul actually be around, only for the psychopomps to come down, explain to the party what was happening and ensured the group he'd get a happy after life before trying to take him away. As his dude was dead, i didn't even let him make rolls for his soul to resist, so instead, he started attacking with his necromancer, who was just an insane, terrible impersonator. The rest of the party didn't help in that fight, and they let her get beaten within an inch of her life before they flew off. Once the group healed her back...She instantly tried to kill them for not helping.\n\nWe had to have a long chat with him after that. In the end, we made him agree not to use or reference that character again until he had gone one entire month, at minimum, of using a different, unrelated character. I think it broke his heart, not being allowed to use a guy who was clearly dead and had been given a good a send off as any. I also guessed he had other issues, because he got very quiet and withdrawn after that. I never asked, but I tried to offer a hand if he needed it.\n\nAfter quitting the group for a few months, he did return, but he did it with a character we all helped him make. One he doesn't use to this day, as he goes through a few new classes and characters now, but it still amazes me just how devoted he was to being a fucking furry anthro wolf dude who wore little armor and liked to sniff things.",

        "text": "The **[accompanying comic lives over here](http://www.handbookofheroes.com/archives/comic/very-secret-doors)**, but here be my tale. Ahem:\n\nSo no shit there they were, stuck in a creepy crypt with naught but their wits and their determination. The wizard had to work that day, the alchemist had called in sick, and the cleric was back in town making scrolls. That left a party full of full BAB types to find a secret door. In other words there was a shitload of determination in the party, but not a lot of wits.\n\nNow it so happens that the party had recently acquired four adamantine glaives. The adventure specifically calls out the fact that this whole level is a long-abandoned secret tomb, so there aren’t any random encounters. That means there weren’t any penalties for making loud noises. Thus it was that a chain gang of warriors began prodding at walls, moving a few feet down, and prodding again. It was like the opening of **[O Brother, Where Art Thou](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKkwOem9Vl8)**? Much glaiving and a great many ruined crypt walls later, the party managed to stumble upon an actual secret door.\n\n“It worked!” they cried. (See also [**clock, broken**](http://thedailyquotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/even-broken-clock-right-twice-a-day-life-quotes-sayings-pictures.jpg).)\n\nMuch to my chagrin, the next section of dungeon was an apparently pointless series of twisting corridors.\n\n“Oh no,” I moaned.\n\n“Oh yes!” the cried. The **[synchronized glaive team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G5KtQynWvc)** sprang into action once more.\n\nFor some inexplicable reason they decided that the trap door most likely lay in the ceiling. Once again using the few tools at their disposal, they decided to lie prone on the party’s 10′ x 10′ flying carpet, each man to a 5′ square, and creep along the ceiling one 10′ square at a time. Everyone took 20 for each individual square, taking no less than 70 minutes to prod at every square inch of the ceiling. Stone dust coated their faces. Blisters began to form on their hands. They were filthy. They were tired. They’d found freaking nothing.\n\nAs much as my players enjoy watching me squirm, even they were getting tired of the shenanigans at this point. The prospect of doing the same thing another three times—once for each wall and once for the floor—was not attractive.\n\n“Is it even worth our time?” they wondered.\n\n“Dude, just ask the once-per-day divination item.”\n\n“I predict a high probability of success within the next half hour,” enthused the chirpy little construct.\n\nAnd so, muttering mixed curses and prayers, they returned to their work. More interminable time passes in-game. The cavalier’s riding gecko has long since fallen asleep. The fightin’ gnome realizes he’s too small to use a medium sized glaive and switches over to a dagger. Everyone is covered in sweat and grime. Finally, about 8′ off the ground, hard against the ceiling and nearly impossible to spot from the ground, one of the glaives clunks into the secret door. It had been a DC 36 Perception check to find. The highest anyone could achieve by **[taking 20](https://roll20.net/compendium/pathfinder/Taking%2010%20and%20Taking%2020#content)** was a 33. In my infinite mercy, I judged that the circumstance bonus from synchronized glaiving made up the difference. Also, I wanted to get on with the freaking adventure.",

        "text": "We were playing a Mid\\-length campaign set in the 1990's, so the internet was a thing, but it wasn't really useful for proper research yet, nor was it that easy to access. The plot was that some dude was putting the souls of dead people inside cars and other machines to try and create an auto\\-mobile army.\n\nThe leader of the group was a god fearing, bible bashing, mostly insane priest who hated tech, and we were all pretty sure that he had escaped from an asylum, while the others were the equivalent of the scooby doo crew. There was even a dog, specifically a pug called bonzai. They all shared this big ass van that was possessed by the spirit of one of the characters dead mother, so things got freudian very quickly whenever they had to drive anywhere.\n\nWhile they were in joe's mother out in the middle of nowhere, they pulled up into a motel for the night. They specifically chose this spot of all places because there was so little tech, and if there was anything possessed chasing after them, they'd be able to see it coming miles away. Bonzai and his owner sherry poked about the place while the others split up, checking for an owner, or if the place was abandoned, the keys to lock the doors. The priest found himself in the basement, stumbling about in the dark with a lighter to shine his way, refusing to use the lights because he was so paranoid about tech that he refused to even consider it. Good thing to, as he stumbled right over dead bodies without even realizing it. \n\nI had him making sanity rolls now and then because he spent so much time in the dark, jumping between him and the rest of the party to keep the flow of the game going. He started to see hallucinations, like the spirit of his own dead family. But  the spirit of joe's mother going down to check on him, which was the deciding roll that made him start hemorrhaging sanity points. He and ghost mom never got on at the best of times, but in that moment when she tried to be nice he panicked, fell back...and landed on the corpse of the previous owner of the motel. By now everyone had heard his yelling and rushed to find him, bonzai the pug leading the charge.\n\nHe was stumbling over himself trying to get out of the darkness, mind hanging on by a thread after so many minor sanity rolls, only to get startled by Bonzai who barked at him from the top of the stairs. Because he was in such a nervous state, i had him roll for a san loss check with big bonuses, cos it was just a cute pug that he knew. Failed miserably, lost a grand total of ten sanity, hit zero, went utterly insane.\n\nBy the time everyone else got to him, he was eating Bonzai's head, jibbering about the darkness and quoting random bible verses, occasionally mumbling in a language no one else understood. They blew his brains out before he could hurt anyone else, tossed his corpse down in the basement and buried poor bonzai outside in the dust.  ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/8idqrf/dd_35_why_the_deck_of_many_things_isnt_allowed_at/",
        "text": "As requested by /u/magik_carp\n\nI had been playing a 3.5 Edition D&amp;D campaign, as a Chaotic Good swashbuckler/duelist following the tenets of Cayden Cailean. I’m usually a seat-of-my-pants player, full of crazy on-the-spot schemes, so it worked well for me.\n\nWe were playing through Curse of the Crimson Throne, which was a mostly city-based game.\nAlthough my freedom-fighting character was fun, and his devil-may-care attitude got the party into and out of lots of scrapes, he just wasn’t being very effective- a lot of his abilities were based around fighting humanoid-type weapon-using opponents and catching people unawares, which was really unhelpful when we started running into tons of undead, and my piddly 1d6 damage (due to Strength penalty) was just not cutting it. Even though I’d taken some levels in the prestige class for my god, allowing me to smite evildoers and heal people, I wasn’t being terribly effective.\n\nThe party was a fair way into the game (10-12 levels or so), and someone had bought a Deck of Many Things prop (a printed set, nice artwork and everything). As someone’s birthday present, our GM let us find an in-game Deck, and each choose if we wanted to draw one (or more, per player) cards.\n\nOne player got Wishes, then got to know how to get out of their next dilemma, then was imprisoned by an evil god, then knew how to get out and burned all of his Wishes, and settled for a sack of gold coins. One character made a terrible planar enemy, and then got a pile of cool magic items and a servant all to himself.\n\nI drew a few cards- the Throne (+6 to Diplomacy and a small keep), the Balance (change your alignment to the most opposite from you), and the Jester (+10,000xp, or two more draws).\nSo my fun-loving, freebooting, Devil-may-care swashbuckler turned into a land-owning Lawful Evil manipulator, bent on twisting the world to his will. He was pretty much Discworld’s Lord Vetinari.\n(Side note: as I qualified for the Blackguard class, which allows you to “trade in” some of your previous Paladin levels if you have any, my GM allowed me to trade in some of mine and change my levels around)\n\nHe didn’t want to turn against his friends, because he knew that they far outclassed him. Besides, they were useful, so until he came to power...\n\nMy newly-Machiavellian manipulator changed his tune completely, if not his actions. He freed slaves, did favours for the local Barbarian tribe, and worked against the villainous Queen. And as part of everything he did, he schemed. He took notes of people’s weaknesses. He worked his way into confidences, and masterminded the revolution. He spent his money on stuff not related to the party directly (funding revolutionaries, investing in the church and local businesses, buying off local Lords for influence, or so the other players heard), as well as buying others extra healing potions and a variety of consumables which were handy for them. And he stroked his little goatee and promised that “when I come to power,” things would be different.\n\nThe other player were happy to have these costs sorted without having to contribute their own cash, and my combat prowess had risen considerably, so they were pleased that they didn’t have to be looking after me so much, as well. They assumed I was pretty much downplaying the alignment change so that I could keep my character alive.\n\nI wrote notes for each player, put them into named envelopes, and handed them to each player, as well as one for the GM.\n\nAnd then, at the close of the campaign, the villainous Queen vanquished, I asked my party members to open their envelopes, starting with the GM.\n\nThe GM’s card listed all the steps I’d taken at each point, the money I’d spent on bribes, the Diplomacy checks I’d made to arrange everything.\nShe checked it, double checked everything, checked my skill bonuses and gear, and then nodded “go on”.\n\nThe barbarian was elevated to leadership of his tribe because I had the previous chief assassinated, settling his blood-debt forever and putting him exactly where he had always wanted. The city’s laws were changed to stop discriminating against the barbarians, which meant they stopped raiding and started trading with us.\n\nThe cleric found that the high priest of his church had been imprisoned for blasphemy and treason, leaving him to take the reins... except for finding out that he was addicted to the drugs I had taken over control of, and that he could not cure himself of. For a small sum and considerations, I’d keep him in control of himself, and the church.\n\nOur party’s rogue took no persuading: I offered him the mask of the city’s vigilante, and the keys to the cells. He would be able to travel as he liked, cause havoc as he liked, and never be imprisoned. He just needed to ignore the particular things I asked him to look away from.\n\nAnd our wizard, my most dangerous and perceptive ally, well, his card just read a number, 34. \nIt was the Fortitude save DC for my Assassination attempt, as I slipped my envenomed Assassin’s dagger into his ribs. He looked quizzical, rolled... and came up with a total of about 18. \n(He was a good friend of mine, and was quite pleased with the plot outcome, so he didn’t mind)\n\nI reached under the table and pulled out a plastic toy crown which I’d brought, and placed it on my head with a grin.\n“That’s right. I told you all that when I came to power, things would be different.”\n\nThe players were silent. No-one could believe I’d gone to this level of planning or preparation, or had actually gone through with the alignment change.\nThe GM smiled and called the end of the campaign.\n\nAnd that’s the story why the Deck of Many Things isn’t allowed at that GM’s table any more.",

That could cause the cork on the silver flask inside to pop off, releasing the Fun Stuff inside. The Fun Stuff is diffuse, and so will get out of the iron box.\n\nIn addition, the wizard botched her death touch spell with a roll of 18 to cast, for which I ruled that the flaming skull was now a toxic flaming skull.\n\nOne of the swashbucklers threw knives at the flaming skull, doing a bit of damage at a time, and even scoring two not-very-useful critical successes (as flaming skulls are diffuse, and thus physical attacks are not very effective). The other hung back until they happened upon the idea of using a torch... And then missing.\n\nOddly enough, the flaming skull is not even resistant to fire.\n\nThe flaming skull was thus mostly killed by the pyromaniac wizard with flame jet.\n\nOn another note: Evil grins are a fun GM ~~weapon~~ tool. *cough*",

        "text": "One of the campaigns I ran based on a game, this was supposed to be set during the events of the first dishonored game, with the players deciding which faction they aligned with in the session 0, before being unleashed upon the world. A few classes weren't allowed, like the wizard, and the cavalier, but pretty much everything else was up for grabs. Race wise, I allowed them to use the stats for most races, but they were all humans for flavour.\n\nIt was a four man group. The party consisted of a rogue, a spellsword \\(with a sub\\-class which meant his spells worked like a sorcerers\\), a monk, and a modified cleric. By modified, i mean that they were less about getting rid of undead, and more about summoning smoke monsters to drag people into the endless eternal void.\n\nI gave them five factions to pick from. The royalists \\(the side who wants emily ruling\\), the regime \\(those who want the regent to rule\\), the bottlestreet gang \\(a bunch of thugs\\), the witches coven \\(wants their arch witch to rule\\) and the assassins \\(they work for anyone, depending on the price\\). After mulling it over, they went with the regime. This effected their backstories, with the rogue being a spy under the spy masters employ, same as the monk. The spellsword got his powers from the music he sung, which hit tunes that messed with reality. And the cleric was a heretic who got caught and was being used to hunt others in exchange for a decent life.\n\nGame starts with the players being sent to hunt down some outsider worshippers, which goes...poorly. The cult was tucked away within a flooded section of the city of dunwall, where those infected by a horrific plague were shipped out to and left to die. They stuck to the rooftops, using things like grappling hooks and a few spells to traverse, but eventually one of them had to fall, at the worst possible time. Right as they got to the target building, the spellsword falls 60 ft onto the ground while attempting to grab into the edge of a roof, nearly dying. This alerted the cultists, and the infected outside. The rogue and monk impaled him with the grappling hook, dragging him up into the sky by his collar bone, all while he's making will saves not to scream like a little girl from the pain. They get him up just as the cult and the plague zombies meet, the cleric healing him up while they watch the small fight. Probably would have worked in their favour if the spellsword hadn't decided to use one of his magic wands to cast fireball.\n\nAll the undead and the cultists knew where it was shot from, and those that didn't die instantly scattered, alerting everyone inside the building...and pretty much everyone within the drowned section of the city. They had been briefed about the other factions in the flooded district, warned not to attract their attention, but now they were on everyone's radar. They dropped down and killed most of the cultists while they had the time, gathering up what relics they could before getting attacked by an assassin hitsquad who would have been a threat if the party hadn't made them come through the front door and blow them up with a barrel of oil. The next thing to attack them as they made their retreat was a small group of witches who nearly ripped them to shreds during a surprise round. But they all got killed when the monk, being the smart ass that he was, took down the building the witches were on by punching some of the walls down, creating a domino effect which took out several more structures.\n\nNeedless to say they were commended for killing so many members of the opposition, but punished for making such a noise. They were given a second task, to capture and/or kill the leader of the bottlestreet gang, slack jaw. He worked in a distillery, a rather large one, with mostly drunk thugs and his only real claim to power was how wide spread his influence was with other gangs and citizens. The task was supposed to be covert. So naturally, the players begin by getting three barrels full of oil, strapping them to a cart, then setting them on fire before pushing them off down to the entrance of the distillary area. After this, they then proceed to summon two unholy abominations, set them loose after the explosion, and sneak around back while they go on a murder spree.\n\nThey sneak in through the skylight, killing the guards who are in the main area before cracking open one of the booze stills. They get as far back as they can, and fire a fireball into each of them before running. this blew up the entire building, nearly killing them in the process, but since they were on the edge, they just survived. Its such a shame they blew up some really cool gear, and some plot threads, and about a block of the city. Because the stills weren't housing booze, they had Whale oil in them, much more valuable and useful, but very explosive.\n\nBy now the lord regent realized that these guys weren't suited to being sneaky, but they were reliable. So he gave them one last chance to prove themselves by sailing out to a small island, and leveling the facility there, which had been overtaken by rebels. This was something that i had taken ages making, and i fully expected the players to destroy the entire thing, what i did not expect was for them to turn traitor. \n\nThey went there on a sub, surfacing near the islands beach. They used the cliffs to scale up to an unprotected spot they spent about a day watching before meeting with a member of the royalist faction, one of those who genuinely believed in emily being on the throne. She was Melinda Rosecrans, a member of the rosencrans family who owned a significant portion of the cities legal drug trade and medical facilities. The island was being used to find a cure for the rat plague, by spreading rats with plague immunity into the eco system, who's genes would lead to a decreased size of rat over a few short generations.  At first they were going to kill her, but for some reason they all said \"fuck it, we don't get paid enough by the regime, we're on your side now\". It was quite the heel turn.\n\nThey returned to the city, spread the rats about, and for good measure, raided a nobles house on the way back, blowing it up for good measure by setting the boiler off after putting all the whale oil they found in the basement. This proved to be a good enough of a distraction for them to return to the island...which was set to blow up by the loyalists when they returned, and they all left together. not looking at the biggest bomb of them all while sailing into the sunset.",

After nearly eight months of play many things have happened. So far we have lost about 10 of the initial 30 characters.\n\nRecently our \"heroes\" have encountered tribes of Goliaths living in the mountains. The three tribes were unified by a king called Orgon Wyrmkiller. He is quite old however and has been sick for a long time. Now there are rumours of civil war. Our heroes met with a wise woman of the tribes called Kauvi Peak-Sister, who asked them for help to heal the king. She would send them an agent that can lead them secretly into the Goliath capitol and into the king's bedchambers at night. The other tribes must not know that outsiders have healed the king, for that might be a huge sign of weakness and start a war. A few weeks later the healing - expedition is assembled and, after many adventures, is led into the antechamber of the king's bedchamber. There most of their weapons are taken and they are asked to wait. Kauvi Peak-Sisiter shows up and talks to them for a few minutes. Then they are led before the king, ready to heal him...only to find him murdered in his own bed, lying in a pool of blood, with the axe of one of the characters stuck in his chest! Now, while everyone is shocked, the cleric tries to cast Revivify. Alas, the king has died not one but five or so minutes ago, while they were talking in the antechamber.\n\nKauvi reveals herself as an enemy to the heroes and disappears, only to reappear a few moments later as an illusion, mocking them and telling them that there are two options: first, run and try to escape before the guards arrive. But if they do that, surely the goliath tribes will descend upon their home city and tear it apart. Option two: stand and fight, be slain by the guards, but maybe that will be enough to still the goliath's rage.\n\nThe heroes debate briefly and choose to stand and parley with the guards. Despite some clever tries there is little chance of actual negotiations as the enraged bodyguards start cutting them down one by one. Two are killed outright, the other three knocked unconscious.\n\nA few hours later they awaken in an underground chamber. Kauvi Peak-Sister is there, revealing herself as a hag. She offers to let two of the characters go...but she will personally eat the third one. And they have to choose who remains.\n\nAfter a few days two survivors, a tempest cleric plagued by guilt and an enraged dwarven champion, descend the mountains to bring news of this treachery and the impending war to their home...and because they have escaped the goliaths are gathering an army to come after them. Which is of course what the hag really wanted all along.\n\nThis was the best session I have played in a long time, leaving my players extremely emotionally engaged. What do you think? Would your characters have fallen for the trap? What choice would they have made to try and get out of it? Was I being too cruel on them in the end?\n\nLooking forward to hearing some thoughts!\n",

        "text": "This was one of the few times I got to be a player, it is still some of the most fun I had as one. For those of you who don't know what mage the ascension is, in brief terms, it revolves around the concept that reality is defined by majority consensus within a localized space. This means that if everyone within a city thinks that cars explode when shot in the engine with a big gun they'll explode, then it will explode. Or if a group of people in a bar thinks that time moves by at 1/4th its normal speed, then the bar will have a slower pace of time when compared to the rest of the world. Mages are people who have such strong will, they can manipulate the world to their desires as if they were a huge group of people. It's also set in the world of darkness rpg series, so vampires, werewolves, demons and ghosts are all real.\n\nThe campaign itself was centered around the idea that we were all young mages fighting against a local group of punk wizards who were causing problems. Think of it as a gang war but with magic. We were only three people though, so it wasn't going to be easy.\n\nThe way mage's rules work is a bit complex, so I'll have to simplify things. I was lucas Dumas, a rich, manipulative spellcaster who focused on spells that manipulated living matter and spiritual energies. The next was tedd rice, a dirt poor hillbilly swamp mage who fucked about with time and space. The last of us was, and i shit you not, jemma joel julius jaspers junior, who was the group telepath and tech chick. We were more powerful than the punks due to our better training, but we still had to be careful.\n\nWe all sheltered at my home, which was an old lighthouse, converted into a swanky bachelor pad, but was soon expanded to give everyone some living space. From up on high we could see the entire city below, the fire of Lucas and jemmas masters house still flickering in the sunset light, it was there we decided to make our plans to get some sweet revenge. But first, money. I began by getting a job as a vet and house call masseuse, who worked in the porn industry on the side. Jemma fucked with the stock market and ran a small custom PC business. Tedd made copies of bills and put them in other peoples bags while taking their legit money, cos he was good enough with time to distort peoples perception of it.\n\nWhen we had enough we bought some resources in order to construct a sturdy magic barrier around the house by paying a friend of our dead master. With that settled, we went on the offensive, scouting out the city for the enemy. I started on the ground, using my natural charisma to dig for info, moving from bar to bar, subtly asking questions, shifting my appearance between every place i went to while jemma scanned the internet. Tedd snuck about the seedier parts of the city and kept an eye out on things.\n\nWhen we returned, i had found a few leads, jemma had found a likely building the punk mages were in...and fucking tedd had spent the entire night stealing from drug dealers, amassing somewhere around three kilos worth of crack, weed and heroin. We eventually just let him keep it, but had him agree not to use any of it until we were in 'down time' mode, so he wouldn't cause trouble by distorting reality and rip holes in the fabric of space time.\n\nJemma's lead turned out to be a vampire den of all things, But what could have turned nasty ended up with us gaining an additional ally in the form of the local nosferatu clan. They proved to be a bigger aid than any of us expected, because after checking out a few of my dead leads, they pointed us in the right direction, an old church. Breaking in was easy, my magic was strong enough to allow me to pick up and throw cars, so a small lock was nothing. Tedd loaded up his machine pistols while jemma, the weakest of our group in combat, stayed behind us to act as a debuffer against the enemies. The punks we fought inside were tough, some of them having gone the same arcane rout as me, so it was like two big hulks smashing against an even bigger hulk, but when jemma mind wipped one of them, effectively making them an infant mentally, it got much easier. Tedd was being tedd and warping space time so his bullets hit people at the speed of light. We killed all but one, who i just carried back to our lighthouse after ripping his limbs off, sealing the stubs shut, and fucked with his bones so he'd be encased in them.\n\nWhen we got back, i tortured him for a bit in the basement, subjecting him to pain unlike anything a human being could possibly experience, took three hours to break him after threatening to bring jemma in, read his mind, and fetch some of his family to do this all to instead. He spilled his guts after that \\(while i was holding his guts\\). Turned out the punks were planning on releasing a new anime at the local anime convention in order to build up public perception that they were powerful and badass, make a meme of themselves and spread the idea through people. if it worked, they'd be able to use their magic out in the open without as much backlash \\(by backlash, i mean that a mage can get hurt when they try to use their magic to create something which goes against majority perception, and it's noticable.\\).\n\nI made myself look like vageta from DBZ, while jemma cosplayed as some chick from bleach, tedd got me to make him look like Dio from jojo's bizzare adventure. When we got there, it was your typical anime convention, lots of weebs, a shit ton of merch, some live shows of Idol groups, the works. We knew what the punks looked like now after their friend had surrendered everything we needed from his mind, so finding them wasn't hard, they strolled around in the open like they owned the place. \n\nHow did we deal with this situation in public, where our magic could cause backlash? Simple, i started by making myself sound exactly like Christopher Sabat, pointed at the punk dressed like goku, and yelled \"Kakurot! We meet again, it's time to settle the score, once and for all!\" I then used my magic to make myself bulk up, hair turn yellow, and create a gust of wind all around me before charging at the fucker and would have beat him to a bloody pulp. But he had apparently came here with the exact same idea as me, did the same thing, and we started engaging in an all out brawl in the middle of the eating area while a crowd of weebs cheered us on. Since we were in the middle of anime con, neither of us could really use our more dangerous attacks \\(My go to lethal move was to generate poison claws and impale people\\), so we were just bare knuckle brawling, smashing each other again and again, only to regenerate and heal our wounds constantly. I didn't even care about the others, or the bad guys plans, or anything, after a while it became personal, I had to defeat him, I had to defeat this imposter goku, for my sayian pride!\n\nThat was one side effect the DM included, with public perception distorting me until i felt like i was vageta...the perk of this was that i could access schools of magic i shouldn't be able to. I fired off beams of energy at the guy, blasting him over and over until there was a smoldering crater where he should have been, but the guy had teleported behind me and smashed the back of my head in, nearly killing me, key word being nearly. With one spin and punch, I put my fist right through his chest, threw him across the room, and tried to blast him to pieces. But one of his friends used time magic to slow things down, giving the guy just enough time to heal up and fire a blast back. There was an all out beam struggle in the food court.\n\nMeanwhile tedd was fighting two dudes in the back, trying to get the anime tape these guys had brought along. But being tedd, he didn't need to try too hard. snapping his fingers, freezing time, he unloaded his magazines around the two before plucking the tape out of their suitcase, Uttered \"You were already dead the moment you challanged me\", and restarted time.\n\nJemma should have died there, as she got stuck with the leader, but this was when we learned of her trump card. We had all thought she had put her points into mainly support rolls, with some entropy on the side so she could destroy peoples minds, but nope, turns out she could do much more than just that, like teleport. She warped the big bad out into fucking orbit, only to watch his body explode in the vacuum of space.\n\nThey were finished with their fights when goku and I were on our last legs. The problem was that he had public perception on his side, because goku always won, but I had the people on my side, who wanted vageta to win. That was all I needed. The beam struggle sputtered out as we had lost the energy to continue it, finishing the fight with our fists. The only way this was going to end would be one swift killing blow. So in order to make an opening for it, I destroyed his balls with a swift knee shot, broke his collar bone, then punched his head clean off before pulping it. The prince of sayians had finally won!\n\nWe legged it soon after, cos we knew all hell was going to break loose when the leaders of the magic world found out about this. It was tense getting out of there, and could have been easier if jemma had teleported us, but she kept it a secret still. This campaign went on for a while longer, but that was the definite highlight. ",

        "text": "Ok. Most of my group's campaigns do not end up going past 3\\-4 sessions max because by that time strings of stupid things happening have generally screwed things up. However, most of these one off things are pretty dang funny, so I'm going to list a few of them. Here we go:\n\n# The Griffon Saga\n\n**Session 1**\n\nOk, this first one is entirely the fault of the DM \\(who enjoyed annoying us to no end\\). The first session our group played ever, someone bought a donkey and loaded all of their stuff onto it so their character wouldn't be burdened by the extra weight. The second the party leaves town, the DM says:\n\n\"A griffon descends from the sky. Before any of you can react, he grabs the donkey and flies off with it.\"\n\n**Session 2**\n\nSomeone else decided to DM this part of the campaign so the former DM couldn't pull anymore shenanigans with stealing every belonging of 1 party member. The party encounters a chimera. Former DM says: \"I jump onto its back to try to tame it.\"\n\nNat 20.\n\nThe chimera flew off, but he avoided the entire fight and technically now owned the chimera.\n\n**Session 3**\n\nThis is the session I joined the group, and the session the first DM took over again. The group was exploring a cavern. We run into an ANCIENT RED DRAGON. Keep in mind the average level of our party is 2\\-3, and I am level 1. It stares us down, planning to kill us for intruding into its cavern. We have 2 people who can speak Draconic in our party: the Dragonborn, and me, a Drow. The Dragonborn attempted to talk the dragon out of killing us, but rolled a Nat 1 and ended up tripping over her own words and becoming incredibly flustered. So I tried to roll deception against it. I walked up to the dragon, looked it dead in the eyes, and said, \"We are tax collectors for Tiamat. You've been neglecting in your tributes to her.\" \n\nI roll a 19, with my deception mod, a 23. \n\nAnd that is how we avoided yet another boss fight and instead stole the dragon's gold.\n\n**Session 4**\n\nRemember that Griffon from the first campaign? One of our players said the DM was being unfair and wanted someone else to take over. Someone did, but as his last act as DM, the first DM simply said, \"Roll an acrobatics saving throw.\"\"Uh... \\*rolls\\*...9?\"\n\n\"You are instantly killed by a donkey falling out of the sky and hitting you at terminal velocity.\"\n\nAlso in this session, we found a fairy companion who was very helpful but very annoying. We named it Navi. Navi did not survive to the end of the session.\n\nI have several more stories like this, but they all take place in different campaigns. If you are interested in hearing the others from my other campaigns, let me know.",
