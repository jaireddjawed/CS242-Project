I went to her house when for whatever reason I couldn't be with my mom.. so when I would be asleep on the sofa I just would remember walking around the house real slow I couldn't explain it the feeling of fear. Not like the fear you feel. But as of it was being given to me. But anyway this happened more than one occasion I'd go to my grandma and sister and try to wake them up and they did. My grandma is religious and We believe in the Lord Jesus. Anyway after a few times of this happening she'd get holy water from her church st Josephs for no reason related to me just because. it wasn't just a sleep walking type of thing Id go through it was what it was I'd see too or not see but just say. Like random stuff like \"why did Jesus have to die\" and there was something else in the corner of the living room where I slept I don't remember seeing it I just remembered saying that. There's something in the corner so scared. Unexplainably scared. Anyway I'm most likely never gonna think about it for the rest of my life it'd come up lately and I don't really wanna dwell on it anymore. Just needed to get it off my mind",

I open the first door and I come across a room full of flies (disgusting my nothing abnormal except a few hundred thousand flies on the ground)\nthat's the problem for me, it's not just this piece that and in this state, I took photos to share them with you and prove my words!  after having completed my task (cleaning everything) I went back there the next morning, and it was not my amazement when the room was once again filled with flies!  and it continues (still today) I open the room I clean it then I close the door and reopening it later (a few minutes) the room and new ones filled... \nthe incessant buzzing literally terrifies me... the worst part is that it's fly doesn't fly... it walks and crawls... no matter how much I use insecticide they always come back!  the worst part of all this is that she stuck to each other on the walls and around a Christian cross on the wall, yesterday she even turned around... I don't know what to do!  Has anyone ever heard of a similar phenomenon?  thank you in advance !\n(I had not seen before but I can not share my photos here, sorry in advance)",

Its like a powerful force that I keep resisting against, Almost like a powerful magnet that is sucking me in. I resist it because I feel that if I don't resist it will take over my whole body. I even mumbled out the words \"stop\" but whatever this thing was, it didn't stop. It got to a point where I stopped resisting and went to sleep. I don't know if I was even asleep but it was a state of being between wakefulness and sleeping. I vividly remember this thing biting my neck and penetrating me, like LITERALLY having sex with me while I Iay on my side.However, I won't deny that it did feel good,but at the same time, I didn't want it. \n\nI've had these experiences since 15 years old, I am 17 now. These things would happen once in while, at least every few months. However, it did stop for a while since I started sleeping with crystals by my pillow, but last night I had forgot to place them by my pillow before going to sleep.",

I’ve known I’m energy sensitive for a long time, I haven’t seen entities except for once in my life, but that’s a story for a different time. \n\nI’m here today because in my dreams, I often get glimpses into the future. Nothing definitive, I can never tell exact times something is going to occur, and I confirmed this week it wasn’t deja vu. I was helping a friend with work, and our conversation began to feel familiar. I finished her sentence but it wasn’t the words that I finished, it was her noise of frustration that she’s never made before but I knew she was going to make. I followed this up with essentially brushing it off as deja vu because she is a skeptic, and the conversation wasn’t worth the time to me. \n\nBut in the past, I’ve dreamt of conversations, events or people that were in my life at an unspecified time in the future. I knew my divorce would occur before I even got married, just not when. I have met people in my dreams that I would meet later in life, just didn’t know exact time and place, just that I’ve seen them before. \n\nDoes anyone have any explanation? I don’t want it to stop or anything, just a post I’ve been meaning to make.",

        "text": "Alright guys I need your help. We’ve had a lot of weird shit happening lately and I don’t know what to do or think. This is going to be a long one so buckle up. \n\nA couple months ago I was in my attic getting some stuff down. Now it’s only a hole in the ceiling and I just stand on a ladder and poke my top half through to get stuff. I was up there for a minute organizing and making sure everything was labeled correctly, when all of a sudden I felt a hard poke in my shoulder, like a finger poking me. I turned around so fast and of course no one was there. I instantly got chills and got out of there so quickly. I brushed it off. \n\nFast forward to two weeks ago. My husband and I were cleaning up and talking and all of a sudden he spazzes out and it looking all around him. He said he felt a hard poke and a shock. Mind you I didn’t even tell him what happened to me (He works nights and honestly by the time we talked later the next day I didn’t even think to say something) we both instantly got the chills and I joked about how someone was really trying to get our attention. We went about our night. \n\nThat same night I was in our bedroom working, and he was in the living room watching TV, when all of a sudden the lights in the room next to him go completely dim. Like dimmer than we can even put them before they turn off. This has never happened before and hasn’t happened since. We have cameras so I was able to go back and actually see it happen. It was so weird. He had to physically get up and turn it off and then on again to get them to go back up. \n\nLast Thursday I was sleeping and had what I think was a lucid nightmare, but I’ve never experienced this before so correct me if I’m wrong but this is how it went. \n\nSO I don’t know where I was but my husband and I were in a house. We were in separate rooms. I went to “my room” I think to fold laundry or something \nHe stayed in his room \nThen while I was doing whatever and watching TV a scary scene flashed on the TV and it scared me so bad I like fainted or something and had like dark spots in my vision. Like I couldn’t see clearly and felt dizzy… which I actually felt in real life. It was the craziest feeling \nThen I had to try and make my way to my husbands room while not being able to see because there were big black spots in my vision and I was falling all over the place\nI open his bedroom door and start to say his name and then fall down face first and have a seizure.. \nBut like I swear to god I felt it all\nlike I don’t know what it feels like to faint or have a seizure but now I feel like i do and I knew in the back of my head I was dreaming but I couldn’t wake up \nAnd once I did wake up I couldn’t move or talk for a second \n\nI couldn’t sleep for the rest of the night. \n\nFast forward to now almost a week later. \nI have a 3 year old. She hasn’t been sleeping AT ALL lately and wakes up and is up for hours fighting with me because she doesn’t want to sleep. Tonight I crawled into bed and just got comfy and I hear my door open. I’m covered in blankets so I can’t see her but I can feel and hear  her little foot steps. I want to see how far she’s going to try and take this before I put her back in bed. I feel her hands out pressure on the mattress next to me. I am trying hard not to giggle then she doesn’t move for a second, I think it’s because she trying to see if I’ll move. But it’s long enough so I turn around to catch her in the act….\n\nShe’s not there. No one is there. I don’t know what I felt or heard but it scared me so badly I can’t sleep. \n\nWhat the heck is going on?! Honestly I just want to sleep. I don’t want to be waiting on the next thing. \n\nIf anyone has any idea what is going on or what I should be doing please help!",

It happened a couple years ago and it has stayed with me ever since.\n\nMy girlfriend at the time and I were visiting her stepdad and mother who lived just a few hours away from my city, in Tatamagouche, NS.\n\nI remember I was standing in the kitchen and in the corner of my eye I swear I saw what appeared to be a black figure like a dog moving near my feet. Thinking it was their dog I spun around to look but no dog was there - their dog was quietly snoozing on a chair in the livingroom. \n\n\"Was the dog just out in the kitchen, dude?\" I asked her stepfather.\n\n\"Nope, she been sleepin' for the past 30 minutes or so!\"\n\nI was utterly puzzled, and I swear I must have hallucinated something. Confused, I simply decided to dismiss the encounter as me being tired from the drive down to their place.\n\nLater that evening I decided to bring it up to her stepmom, casually, while we were all gathered around outside.\n\n\"Yeah, it was the weirdest thing -- I was just standing there and in the corner of my eye I saw a weird black figure of some kind, near my feet!\"\n\n\"See? I fuckin' told you I wasn't lying! I fuckin' told you there were shadows!\" she said, playfully smacking her husband on the arm.\n\nMy girlfriend also told me about how there was a certain cupboard that her grandfather used to open to grab a snack in the middle of the night, while he was still alive. They told me what cupboard it was. I checked it over and nothing seemed too weird to me about it.\n\nWe slept in the livingroom, and after waking up in the middle of the night I looked around in the darkness to find my phone to check the time. As I was fumbling around in my pockets I began to get this distinct feeling of being watched. A few seconds had passed and, I shit you not, ***I heard the sound of that fucking cupboard open and close*** as if somebody had opened it, took a moment to look for a snack, and then closed it.\n\nNOBODY else was awake at that time. The dog was snoozing in a separate bedroom. I immediately shone my phone's flashlight in the kitchen and saw NOTHING.\n\nNever had any weird experiences to that degree prior, or since.",

I get paralysis and can not move but can here everything in the room and I am screaming or trying to touch my wife to break free but as the shacking continues it feels like I am being swallowed by a darkness that it pulling me deeper and deeper into darkness. I am screaming for help but nothing comes out or try to move and after some time fighting with all I might finally a whisper comes out or a flinch of movement.

The head sensation is also weird it is like someone is shaking my head violently but I am not moving as with these episodes I have asked my wife and she says I do not move.",

The woman is very friendly and tries to help animals and the guy isn't malicious but not helpful either. I want to make friends with the female entity as she seems like someone I would vibe with. Does anyone have any suggestions?\n\nThe guy mostly just does pointless stuff to make his presence known while the woman is always trying to help animals, which is why I vibe with her. Her two most active instances were when I heard her clear as day soothing the dogs (my job is a doggy daycare) and helping a cat belonging to an employee that used to live there by opening and sometimes unlocking a door on several occasions granting it access to the employees plants, which the cat liked to chew on.",

Instead of things just falling as if a small push, I'm hearing things in the room I use for storage sounding like their being thrown.  I've found my daughter's shoes in the middle of the floor (the storage is mostly her things) \n\nThe light in my bedroom continues to flicker/dim/go out.  Two or three days ago, I was watching TV and heard the sound of glass shattering.  I went into the kitchen and it looked as if someone took something heavy to two drinking glasses that were on the drainboard.  Glass was everywhere. they were both shattered. \n\nNow I'm thinking that it's not George, just letting me know that he's still around, but rather something ominous. \n\nIdeas?  Thoughts?

When i had my first session with her she reported that she only sees the the hallucinations at her mothers house. She also reported that she believes the shadow people are demons. She says the shadow people tell her to kill herself and hurt herself. I went to her mothers home today for another session and she told me she is not the only one that has seen her dead cousin. I said bet and told her to bring in her relative who has seen it. She brings out her cousin who reports that one evening she was washing dishes and she had a feeling that someone was watching her. She turned around and saw the dead cousin. The cousin ran off and disappeared into a room. I should also mention the 3 year old cousin was brutally murdered in that house and her ashes reside in the home. There has also been another known murder in the house of an adult male. There has also been torture that has happened in the home. At first I thought this was just psychosis but multiple people have seen the cousin in the home after her passing. What am I dealing with here? They mentioned that the home has been blessed before but years ago.",

        "text": "Back in 2011-2013 I had a dream that a meteor would crash into Earth. I used to be fearful of the many Doomsday Predictions. \n\nNow, this has little to do with the actual strange occurrence. I was having this dream around 2011-2013 about the doomsday meteor. I remember how I tried begging with the meteor who could talk asking for some more time. \n\nYet, the meteor was adamant about landing and that's when I woke up. The strange thing that occurred was when the tv turned on by itself (no else was awake so I knew this wasn't a prank). I just thought the tv short circuited or something as a logical explanation. So, I wasn't too freighted.\n\nAlthough, the part that freaked me out is that the tv turned on to a channel of a religious guy talking about the coming of the Rapture. This freaked me out because my family was not religious, and I also often look for a logical explanation before my lizard brain takes over. \n\nAn example, as I've talked myself out of the number of times an end of world has happened and logically the world will end one day but most likely not in my lifetime (if you aren't counting a possible WW3 where many people will blame a religious event). So, eventually someone will be right.    \n\nLastly, I remember sitting to listen to the tv a bit longer before effectively changing the channel and turning off the tv. I don't remember what I did after that, but I do remember being freaked that year thinking that maybe the rapture will come in the form of a meteor? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm glad nothing occurred but all the same as I learned coincidences can be terrifying. And I still don't know the cause for why the tv was on that channel and why it turned on by itself.",

I was a about to hit the sabotage button when the radio turned on and I hot the kill button by mistake. Seeing enough horror movies I bolted upstairs saying, \"Nope, nope, nope!\", all the way up. I saw what happened when I closed the door and was being voted off. I obviously lost but explained what happened to the other crew mates in the loby after the round ended. Some laughed, some said they would've done the same thing. My mom was in the other room and asked me if there was anything else to be brought up. I said yes but I wasn't going back down there until there was light outside again. She agreed thankfully and I retrieved the laundry in the morning. The basement still had plenty of light from the other light bulbs but I wasn't going to take any chances. I'm not afraid of the dark necessarily, I'm afraid of what may be in the dark!",

        "text": "When I was 17 (I’m 23 now), i experienced my first real encounter with the paranormal. I was relaxing at home when my best friend (16yo) texted me basically begging for help. I asked him what the problem was. He was a rebellious kid growing up in a strict Apostolic Southern Pentecostal family and had been getting into trouble a lot. I was thinking, in my head, that he had gotten himself into trouble. He texted me saying that there was something in his house. Something evil and paranormal. I didn’t believe him. He asked if I could pick him up and grab some sage and a few other witchy stuff, to get whatever was in his house to leave (he wasn’t Christian despite going to the church his whole life). I humored him out of curiosity and we got the supplies. We arrived at the house while his mom was away (she didn’t like me very much). Before we got out my friend grabbed my arm and said, “I know you don’t believe me, so I want you to go in to the house by yourself, you need to experience what I’m talking about.” I said, “ok.” And I started walking towards the front door. When I got within 10 feet of the door the porch light started flickering and turn off. I passed it off as coincidence. I open the door maybe a foot and peered through,looking directly into my friends room. It was dark. I got this powerful feeling of dread and fear as I looked into his room. I shut the door immediately. Shaking, I looked over at my friend with a look of horror and said “WTF!” He said, “see?! I told you something’s in there!” I decided to walk through the house to his room by myself, to see if I could catch anything moving. I started hearing scuttering, of what sounded like claws running across the kitchen floor in the other room. I noped out of there to get my friend. As I was about reach the front door, chills ran up my back, when I saw something in my peripheral vision.  Only saw it for a brief second, but I swear to you, it looked like greyish, gaunt figure on all 4s looking at me in the corner of the room. I looked and nothing was there and I went to grab my friend and the sage. We both walked in cautiously. I was taking this very seriously now. We walked into his room, turn on the lights, and heard a VERY loud bang in the middle of the room like something had hit the floor. Nothing had fallen. Scared the crap out of us. We lit the sage immediately, which seems to have made more active. As we walked around the whole house, I passed by his laundry room which was completely dark. I heard a very soft female voice whisper “come here.” I went white in the face and felt like I was going to be sick. I mustered up the courage to walk in and sage the room. My friend watched me as I did. I turned around after finishing and saw my friend with his eyes wide, which stopped me in my tracks. I asked, “what’s wrong?” He yanks me out of the room and slammed the door behind me. He looks up at me and says, “there was something standing behind you.” At this point I wanted out of that house, but I continued helping. At some point we started acting like we weren’t scared of it. Which seemed to startle it. We started figuring out it was moving between rooms, because the room we were in, wasn’t filled with negative energy like it was before. We finally sensed it’s energy in the study. As soon as we entered, I felt rage. Real primal rage, something I’ve never felt before. I wanted to hurt my friend. Which is very out of character for me. Maybe 10 seconds of feeling like this, the feeling went away like it never happened. My friend told me, that I looked at him for those 10 seconds. I had an angry, psychotic look in my eyes. He told me they looked dead and cold. I’ve never been more terrified. When the energy left the room we continued walking through the house. Showing that we weren’t afraid of it. The energy in the house calmed down after awhile. My friend said that he could handle it from here and I went home. I check in on him a week later and he said it was still around, but had no power over. He would tell it to go away and it would. Hope I never have to experience something that freaky ever again.",

        "text": "I have began to think that my family is dealing with a hereditary haunting. There’s a pattern of comorbid mental illnesses, generational trauma, awful hygiene, and personality disorders. There is a darkness that hangs over my dad’s side of the family and I think it has become increasingly stronger. \n\n My brother (20 and lives at home) has been showing signs of possession. He steals and lies to my parents, abuses drugs (steals cigarettes and money from parents, goes through their room to find valuables ), has disturbing hygiene, sneaks around the house during weird times, and exhibiting manipulative and emotionally abusive behaviors with my mom and myself (22F). \n\nOne specific example of his weird behavior: \n\nHe’s been caught stealing multiple times over the past year. \nMy parents got a safe to protect their money and valuable from him while they are at work.\n The next morning he had found the key they hid and left it on the counter for them with a note saying “he loves mystery and hiding games like this” \n\n Mom has been especially worried about his weird behaviors. She’ll find him acting weird in strange parts of the house and catch him lying about weird things. He refuses to clean his room or put sheets on his bed, let alone help with anything in the house. I can tell she’s also really worried but isn’t sure how to address this situation and feels like she is missing a piece of the puzzle.  \n\nIm going home for the holidays and I’m worried about being cornered by him. We’ve always had  a weird relationship, and this past year I have been vocal about condemning his inappropriate behavior to him and my parents, to which he has been none to happy. It’s been a year since I last saw him. \n\nI’m wondering if there are ways I can protect myself when I go home\nhow I can hold my ground against this type of energy?\nIs there a way I can “test” the demonic presence?\n\nI don’t want confrontation but I do want to have a more clear understanding of what could be going on in the house. \n\nDoes anyone have experience with hereditary haunting, heirloom, evil energy  or demonic possession in a family? \n\nLet me know whatever advice you may have related to a situation like this. Any insight and perspective is needed.",

Let me give some details before I go deep in my own thoughts on what actually happened to me, before I kind of figured it out, and had a literal \" oh damn moment\".  For context, I was in a temporary apartment from my apartment in new York because they were working on my elevator. The tenants and construction. Something in reality already happened around that time, but that was more, my family was kind of going through something. I am about 29 going on 30, black and Dominican, with my own mental disability. However I do like the occult and I do like witchcraft, despite my disability saying \" Are you sure we should do this?\" I will say that, despite it, I have been in the paranormal since I was 7 or younger so I don't see an issue. This was something normal for me, and it manifested into something else, over a 9 to just about, a decade's time of research in certain things, and fucked paranormal  experiences. This one, was me, sleeping on a temporary fold out bed or cot, that I was sleeping on for a time, before after three months, coming back home. So in the last three months, I was getting mentally tired of spirits grabbing and also \" other things\" but also demonic entities.  I had enough of it, and this day I was full blown out of it. I am not mentioning dreams, but I could feel my energy trying to quickly jump back in my vessel. Did not work the first time, my eyes opened. I did so a second time, and my heart rate skipped up, my body felt heavy, my body felt the pain, knowing to my research in this that\n...well, I probably was moving. I find it interesting that it spooked me, but the pain, the energy jump, the exhausted and pain on the neck, forehead and crown chakras....that energy was powerful, considering since I was still in martial arts, or training with a few people in it, but more to the fact that I was in a shitty situation. I mean it was better, then almost being gripped by an invisible force and feeling breathing on the neck but \"meh is what it is and another time. What I found interesting is once I got back in, I did feel more conscious and up. Surprisedly it is not the first, you hear on a sleeping moving body in a vision before blue and white light and then \" ZAP\" back in, but to be in and also, talk to myself on how I noped the fuck out a danger...that is it own thought. Last I remember is my body function click back on, considering I have seen and been witness to strange shit.\n\nAnyway, thank you for reading\n\nP.S. If you find your way in your mind, and see red instead of blue, or light, be cautious. \n\nAnyway, thank you.",

We were looking at rural properties west of Ottawa.\n\nA realtor agent took us to this nice little 100 or so year old house with a couple of acres surrounding the house.\n\nBeing a gentleman I, of course let my gf and the realtor go first.\n\nAs soon as I fully crossed the threshold an angry voice screamed in my head \"GET OUT OR DIE!\"\n\nOf course, being smart, I quickly said \"sorry\" in my head and turned around and left.\n\nI stood at the car watching the house, shaking in my boots, so if the house tried anything I could run for my life.\n\nWhen gf and agent came out and asked what happened I just said this wasn't the house for me.\n\nAbout 8 or 9 years later I went down that road just to see the house but I couldn't find it.\n\nOh.. \n\nI once saw to hellhounds cross in front of my car on the way to work the midnight shift at Purolator.  Did you know hellhounds have burning red eyes?  My entire being did the \"flight\" part of flight or fight.  I never went that way to work ever again.",

I would never even think of doing that. I've watched enough documentaries to know that it only takes one angry spirit (or two) to follow you home to start banging cabinets at night. Whenever I walk by a cemetery or small graveyard, I'm always respectful because I know what paranormal forces are lurking there.",

        "text": "My family has around 360 acres in northern Oklahoma that has been in our family since the land rush. Growing up, the family would meet there for thanksgiving and Christmas, but as the family expanded, it was quickly outgrown. Nowadays, I'm about the only person that goes there, and I go/went there regularly to train with my firearms. \n\nI went there earlier this year and had an experience that shook me so badly, that I haven't spoken about it until recently and will never go back there alone. I arrived around 2pm and set up my targets, but something felt off. I use an electronic headset for hearing protection that also amplifies ambient noise, and I noticed that everything seemed to stop. No wind, no bugs, no birds, nothing. Just complete and total silence, which is very unusual for the area. \n\nI run my normal drills and as the sun starts to set, things get stranger. Odd smells (like a dirty litterbox + body odor) started coming around, and I noticed that the coyotes were crossing the field west of me, almost as if they were consciously avoiding entering the woods nearby. Then, I started hearing interference coming over my headset, and what sounded like disembodied voices speaking in an indiscernible language that I couldn't hear with the naked ear. Now, I'm starting to worry; I start gathering my things, and I hear what sounds like a woman's blood-curdling screams coming from the woods. I've heard mountain lion's and bobcats squaring off, which we do have on the property, but this sound was neither of those things. Around the same time, I got what I can only describe as a nauseating, omnidirectional feeling of being watched, shortly followed by very distinct footsteps trudging through the foliage in the treeline approximately 30yds from my position. I've been an avid hunter since childhood and familiar with noises of the woods, and the cadence of the footsteps were indicative of a large, bipedal creature- oddly human like. Very concerning, considering I'm in the middle of a large swath of property that's 25 miles from the nearest populated area. \n\nI pull my phone out to take video, and I start scanning the treeline with my flashlight. Standing behind a tree at the edge of the treeline, was a tall, black silhouette with spindly limbs and a pale face, looking directly at me. I managed to capture a great still image of it from the video that I will try to find and attach. I quickly grabbed my range bag and made a run towards my truck. I get about 50yds from the truck, and the lightpost on our property (that is hooked up to county power and has never turned off in the 20 years I've been going here) suddenly cuts off. Now, I'm blindly running in the direction I *believe* my truck is in while I hit the unlock button on my fob to find the lights. I get in my truck, speed off, and as I'm watching in the rearview, the lightpost turns back on. \n\nI apologize for the long post, but I'm finally ready to get this out in the open for interpretation. I tend to think of myself as a rational person that doesn't necessarily believe in the \"woo\" kind of stuff. Although, my mother described me as being sensitive and somewhat gravitated towards \"energies\" as a child, hence why I found r/paranormal to ask. I was doing everything I could to rationalize or come up with a reasonable explanation for the things I was experiencing, but I have no explanation. The kind of fear this experience put into me is/was unlike any kind of fear I'd ever felt.",

        "text": "So I’ve always read about stuff like this happening to others, but I honestly always took them as some sort of creepypasta type thing, so I never took the idea of  dimension hopping or witnessing some sort of overlap seriously. (I apologize in advance as I’m using my phone)\n\nSo me and my brother carpool to work since his place of work is close to mine, plus we start and get off around the same time. So he’ll show up at my place in the morning and we leave from there.\n\nNow Im going to tell you exactly what I did when we got home from work.\n\nThere’s these two stray cats I’ve “adopted”, (one day I just gave them some scraps and they just kept coming back so I eventually just started buying cat food for them) one is a calico cat and the other is a tuxedo cat with an all black face. They either recognize my car or the sound of the garage door opening because when I’m pulling up they’ll come running in from wherever and I always feed them in the garage. my brother lowers the garage door so that this other asshole-cat doesn’t come in and fight them for the food.\n\nAfter that I go to my room and throw my backpack on my bed while my brother jokes about something that happened to him during his shift I laugh and hang my keys on a hook by my light switch and I specifically remember looking at my bag and wondering if I took home my leftovers from lunch or if i left them in the microwave at work. But I brushed it off, we head back outside to his car and we get in and I wait with him while it warms up. \n\nHe was showing me a video when we saw the two cats wrestling on my porch. The calico cat had the tuxedo cat in a weird headlock. I remember we laughed about it and he joked that they were sparring each other so that they can take on the other stray, but then I ask, “dude, didn’t you shut the garage?” He replied with “yeah, cause that other cat tries to fights them for the food right?” We were confused but figured maybe they found a way out. I remember I just started to feel sick when we were watching them, which I ignored since I have stomach issues anyways so, whatever. After his car is ready we part ways and I go back inside.\n\nI start to feel even more sick but also uneasy like something is wrong. My anxiety is kicking in, I start to feel lightheaded and I don’t know why. I decided to go my room to check my backpack for my food because maybe I’m just hungry? but when I go in, it wasn’t on my bed. \n\nAgain, I brushed it off because I’ve been doing this routine for so long that maybe I THOUGHT I brought my bag in but left it in the car. I check the hook by my door and the keys aren’t there. I’m guessing maybe I left them in the car too because I do that sometimes. I’ll just drop them in the cup holder with the windows rolled down in case our younger brother wants to use it, that way he doesn’t have to bother me if he decides to go on a late night food run or whatever but he wasn’t home, i was there completely alone. So I go to the garage to check only to see the two cats are still in there with the garage door completely shut. These cats are distinct, and I know for sure that there isn’t another pair of cats with the same coat patterns comfortable enough to play  or just chill on my porch.\n\nAt that point it felt like I wasn’t controlling my body, I opened the car, grabbed my bag, check the cup holder for my keys  and they were right there, I just let the cats out and then call my brother right away who answered with “Hey man I was about to call you, I dunno for some reason I have this weird feeling like something’s wrong.” He pulled over on the side of the road to call and check on me but I ended up calling him first. I told him what happened and we spent 40 minutes on the phone talking about it. \n\nHe remembers watching me pour cat food in their bowls and thinking to shut the garage so that they can eat peacefully, he also remembers standing in the hallway telling me what happened during his shift  and watching me open the door to my room and laughing at his story while throwing my bag in, and he remembers me pulling out my keys and hanging them on the hook by my light switch. He also said that he knows for a fact that we both watched the cats wrestle from his car because he remembered joking about them training each other.\n\nOn top of all that we both started feeling sick around the same time but he figured ‘hey it’s that time of the year maybe I’m just getting sick’. I have to say I do take THC gummies or vape, but only before bed as it helps me sleep so I do not use enough to get high but enough to where my body feels it and relaxes. If it was just me I would have convinced myself it’s the cannabis but my brother was with me the whole time and he’s completely sober.\n\nSo I’m wondering if anyone here might know what happened? There’s literally no one I know personally that I can talk to so I’m hoping for at least an idea of what might’ve happened us.. thank you for reading this far.\n\nTL;DR:\nMe and my brother came home from work, I brought my stuff inside yet my keys and back pack wound up back in my car and the cats I feed somehow teleported from inside my garage to the front yard and back again.",

        "text": "When my Mum was in her early twenties she bought her first home in a middling-sized town in Southern England, where she still resides. It was a small place, but she had to work two jobs to make ends meet - and also get in ‘lodgers’. \n\nShe says things felt a bit off with the house quite early on. She recounts a time one night, soon after moving in (pre-lodger) that she was so convinced she’d felt a ‘presence’ in the hallway that she’d barricaded her door with her wardrobe. Nobody was there. But she was so genuinely spooked that she called her Father the next day and begged him to come and install a proper lock on her bedroom door.\n\nOn the night that’s the focus of this story though, my Mum was not alone. Her lodger, Jennifer was in her room. They had stayed up late as they often did at the weekends - laying on the bed, chatting and smoking cigarettes. My Mum had just returned from her bartending job, winding down from a busy shift. They were the only two people in the house.\n\nAt some point the women both became aware of a peculiar noise. Mum describes it as a ‘plucking sound’ almost like a guitar string - but not anything she'd ever heard before. It was coming from the far end of the hallway and seemed to be getting closer to the bedroom doorway. \n\nBoth women looked at one another - confused. But the sound was getting so loud so fast that neither had much time to verbally process the situation, or investigate the origins. In fact, it got to the doorway so quickly that my Mum says she decided her only course of action was to simply cover her eyes with her hands.\n\nThe ‘noise’ entered the room. My Mum says it was the ‘loudest sound’ she’d ever heard. Unearthly, painful. It continued in the room for maybe 5 seconds and then. Silence.\n\nMy Mum’s hands stayed clamped over her face for a while, waiting. Eventually she peered out at the room and at Jennifer. Her friend’s eyes were wide open, her expression one of shock and confusion. *“What was that?”* My Mum asked.\n\nAfter some thought, Jennifer simply replied: “I don’t want to talk about it.”\n\n**“What?!?”** my sister and I always exclaim at this part of the story. You’d simply have to know wouldn’t you? My Mum apparently was and is still okay with not knowing.\n\nJennifer, of course, moved out not long after, and the two women lost touch. \n\nI tend to presume it was a cricket or other foreign insect that the two women were unfamiliar with. Or even more likely, something outside that just sounded like it was inside the house. But I kind of like how my Mum is just happy to live with mystery.",

Like I could see shoulders up with one wearing a hat. No facial features on that one. The other being basically a walking shadow I guess.\n\nIve spoken with coworkers that have been here since the practice started and they quickly confirmed similar experiences and told me it wasn’t a big deal. They went as far as telling me that they call the hat guy Michael and that he used to slam doors when they worked overnights. \n\nSorry for the novel! My main questions are…those of you that have experience with this kind of thing…how did you make peace with them? I tell them/it good morning every day just to be polite. Is that okay? Is there anything special I should or should not do? \nThanks in advance!",

I call for my brother without taking my eyes off of it and as soon as he walks up to me and turns to look, it stops dead in the middle, 45°. \n\nJust a little while later I am at said friend's house watching her daughter(14), and I send the kid to get groceries (10min away) while I cook. I'm singing to myself, just enjoying the moment, and I'm headbanging and shit going \"All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us!\"\n\nAnd clear as a bell from the other side of the house, from my friend's bedroom - I hear the kid's voice. Repeating the line to me. I call out for her, and then literally call her on the phone and she picks up and says \"I can't talk I'm at the register.\" When she did come home we checked her bank details which confirmed she paid the minute after I called her. \n\nMe and my brother move and get a new apartment. I have a friend visting and she's in the bathroom, I'm cooking. I always have a tea towel over my shoulder when I cook, to wipe hands, counters, utensils etc. I hear the bathroom door open and my friend walks behind me, and she yanks the towel where it hangs down my back! I turn and go \"Hey!\" but she's not there. And it yanks again, and I turn and there's nothing. I say outloud \"Seriously stop.\" and a minute later my friend comes out from the bathroom and asks who I'm shouting at.\n\nMy brother says he'll hear me calling for him while I'm not at home - after the event with my friend's daughter, my friend started seeing a shadow man in her own bedroom at night. \n\nMy mom thinks it's some sort of mischevious child teasing me, because I don't feel threatened. But what the hell do I do? It's more spooky than scary at the moment but I worry it will escalate.",

        "text": "Does anyone else get very deja vu feelings not long after a big change in your life? Ever since I was a kid I’ve been able to “see the future” from little tiny snippets that I recall from dreams. I’m talking tiny snippets, like if it were a movie it’d be about 10 frames. These moments are not something that I can usually just wake up and recall, but I can on occasion and do remember them being from a dreamlike sleep. It’s very difficult to explain, they’re so mundane and when I realize the connection from the dream of “seeing” that moment, it’s the most solid connection, like a eureka moment. Does this happen to anyone else? I’ve read that something like this is just chalked up to true deja vu, having been in very similar circumstances before. This is different though because what I remember it from is the dream, not a memory. \n\nA couple of examples:\n- a brief moment of me walking to the bathroom in an office I’d never seen before in my life, only to then find myself in the exact situation, with the exact same lighting, wearing the same clothes (which at the time of the dream I did not own)\n- a moment of watching tv on a couch in an apartment that 6 months later I was living in with the couch, apartment, and tv I did not own or had ever seen\n- a moment of me standing in an empty apartment, 4 months later I am touring the exact apartment I had never seen before or researched, standing in the exact spot in foresaw \n- standing in my parents room, draws pulled open and a feeling of something missing and dread, almost a year later I am cleaning and pulling my mothers things out after she passed away",

        "text": "I now live overseas but growing up I lived in an Edwardian era townhouse in a town on the coast of the UK for about 10 years.\n\nThis house was haunted  by at least two people that I know of and potentially more.\n\nThe first ghost I came across, (I shall refer to him as Mr Coat) was a dark intimidating shadow in the shape of a large man wearing a long coat. He always stayed standing at the front door all night, almost like he was keeping a guard out for something every night. The front door and hallway was directly in front of the staircase so to get downstairs for example to get water, you would have to walk past him. Sometimes you would see his shadow and other times you wouldn’t but you would always feel his presence. The only time I have ever seen Mr Coat outside of his hallway was when I returned home after several years away. I woke up and he was in the room I was sleeping in by the old boarded up fireplace before he disappeared.\n\nThe second occupant of the house is an older woman who we believe fell down the stairs of the house and never left. You would always see her around the stairs and occasionally with no one else in the house you would hear a female speaking to you as you walked up and down the stairs.\n\nThere are also several other strange things that have happened over the years that we have been unable to tie to any particular individual/ghost/phenomena.\n\nMultiple things go missing throughout the house and turn up in strange places. I have had shoes go missing and appear outside, shopping left up the stairs and in random rooms etc. nothing ever malicious but a definite sense of a mischievous joke.\n\nWe have also experienced unexplained hotspots in one specific room near the old boarded up fireplace. Lights turning on and off and footsteps when no one else is home.\n\nThe strangest experience by far though happened on the 11th of November 2018 around 10am the house went mad. Lights and other electronics turning on and off, doors started slamming and footsteps all throughout the house and what sounded like murmuring. It passed after a couple of minutes and it’s never happened again to that extent but it was very strange.",

        "text": "I had a dream that ended with me and a friend getting smoked out of a room. I ended up in a hospital, and saw a woman dressed in white approaching me purposefully. I thought she was a doctor, and she held a pair of small scissors in her hand. She seemed to approach me from outside my dream, appearing out of thin air in front with of me, rather than from within my 20/20 vision. I thought she was going to snip a little sore off of my tongue that was damaged in the smoke, but she immediately forked my tongue with the scissors. I was so surprised, the sound and physical sensation was so real, that I woke up with a start and saw an apparition of a male figure standing next to my bed. He was wearing white as well, very tall, kind of lanky. His coat had lots of pockets, and he was holding scissors in his left hand. I couldn’t see his face. I wasn’t scared, just startled. I took it all in, closed my eyes and opened them again, he was still there just faded a bit. I closed my eyes again, opened them and he was just an outline and then faded away. \nFor context, I’ve been reading Journey of Souls and Destiny of Souls by Dr. Michael Newton. I don’t buy into the evil intention of “demons”, at the most I would say ghosts are souls like us who need a little extra time to process life on earth and don’t have the capabilities/interest of invading dreams. My working theory is that with my recent readings and perspectives tweaking, that my human brain is able to see things that my soul brain understands and isn’t fazed by. Did I see a/my guide offering a symbolic insight? Was this an initiation? Honest, true, and principled thought and communication is important to me, so the typical and even fear-based religious interpretations of a hypocritical forked-tongue speech doesn’t ring true or accurate for me. But, I am very interested in hearing any feedback on similar experiences, forked tongue symbolism that differs from mainstream negative connotations, or outside impressions that I possibly hadn’t considered. On that note, I could see how the dream projection argument could be used here, that in a startled transition between the dream world to waking world blended my perception, but the people in white with scissors was so starkly female in my dream and then male in waking. \nAnyways, thoughts?",

        "text": "Hey there! Not sure if many people will respond but here goes….\n\nJust some history about myself. I am a strong believer in spirits and entities, and have always been sensitive to these things. Unfortunately, ever since I was a kid I’ve been plagued by what I would call dark entities/spirits and nightmares. Most of my childhood I would see shadow figures and my mom, dad, and older brother whom all lived in the same house saw similar things. I would definitely say there is more than one occurrence/spirit. I’ve never fully understood why it happened so much to us. I could probably write an entire book on the activity our house experienced. At this point in my life, I’m in my 20s still residing in the same home and am no longer frightened by these occurrences. However, I’m just learning about the myth/lore of the Hat man and I’m intrigued because of my own experiences with a “spirit” who seems to fit the description.\n\nLet me just start with a little backstory tho about my household over the years. I have a belief that dark spirits have been drawn to our household because there was always a lot of fighting w my parents, drug abuse by my siblings, and both my dad and I have severe depression. There has always been a lot of pain and turmoil which breeds negativity from my personal experience.\n\nMy brother and I had been referring to this spirit as the “half man” for decades now. I remember the first time I saw this man was when I was about 6-7 years old. I was inside the house alone and turned the corner to see a man in a long black trench coat and black top hat,coasting/gliding through our hall way. Half of his body was visible and the other half had disappeared into the wall, like he was gliding right through the wall. Hence the reason we called him the half man. The second experience I had, I was also quite young. I had a nightmare about our house, though I don’t remember the details completely I do remember that I was staring at our TV set, the screen turned to static and all I could hear was white noise. He appeared on the screen and I actually got a close up glimpse of his face. He appeared older with saggy/drooping skin and a very neutral “resting bitch face” type expression. I woke up. Since then, I hadn’t experienced many encounters with him. My dad has seen shadow men, I have seen shadow men, but nothing to indicate it was the same man. \n\nRecently, around 8-9 months ago my dad had been admitted into the hospital and for the first time in many many years, I saw him again. I was home alone soaking in the bath, trying to relax as it was a stressful time. I looked to my left towards the doorway and was startled to see clear as day, the “half” man. I pretended not to notice and he came a little bit closer before disappearing completely. That was the last time I saw him. For those familiar with this myth, is it likely that it was the hat man? What have your experiences been?",

        "text": "Last and first time I posted here was about my daughter's visions and strange behavior. My spouse and I decided to introduce her to a parapsychologist. He came highly recomended by a friend of mine, Dr.F. We currently see him once a week to help our daughter processing this gift she seems to possess somehow. We came to the point that whatever it could be we might as well accept that it is behind our limited understanding. \n\nI guess I haven't been totally honest with you. Something did happen to us 6 month prior to her birth. Something that might have lead to what she experiences today. We decided to tell you to have the big picture. Yet we're aware some of you will call us loony bin material afterward. \n\nMy wife and I are doctors in anatomic tomography. Our job consist in digitalising and rendering 3d synthetics of the human body based on actual organic samples. We do not only aim at creating a 100% coherent patreon but also experiencing every case of dysfunctional pre-mortem occurances. For that matter, we works with a peculiar material, we use cadavers, a lot. I won't get too specific but our 7TO Tepscan coupled with a SPECT-core slices (abstractly of course) corpses in nano segments so we obtain a global 3D/2D and Cone Beam map of the entire body. \n\nFrom monday to wednesday we're under average office agendas 9am-4pm. On friday we're on the graveyard shift. The university kindly provides us a bedroom on the lab floor so we can rest a bit. We are 4 researchers in the anatomic mapping unit. At night we're supposed to work in pairs. My usual coworker is Jerome, a tall and humorous guy, but for some reason that night he had to stay by his ill stroke father. My then 3 month pregnant wife took his place and we started working around 9pm. \n\nThe lab has all the machinery spreaded on  the same floor next to the tiny bedroom covered in anatomic posters. A narrow staircase leads down to the SPN and the body storage. An elevator opens directly into the storage. Now we took a weird habit to gain some time. We scan at least 2 bodies a night, going up and down with the chariot and sliding back the body in can take up to 30 min, so we keep the two bodies in the bedroom and we put them back downstairs when it's done. \n\nIt was 3am when my spouse told me she was exhausted and nauseous. I remember telling her to rest an hour and fetching her a cup of tea. She got into bed without minding the chariot right next to her. Liying on it a Jane Doe burnt to crisp from the upper torso to half the head. I was still blending the frames of the young girl when something unusual, impossible and quite dreadful happened. The complete scheme of the body was topping over all the tabs, I had the perfect rendering of that girl rotating on 3rd view. Oddly, a clipping layer would suppress the burnt parts making her lower face recognizable. I repeatedly tried to close all tabs but the body kept turning round and round. Now a strange noise I never heard before in the lab was coming from the screen. It was a merging between a cry and a whistling airing at a very low pitch. \n\nI headed to the bedroom, I wanted my wife to see that. When I passed the door I litteraly froze. My wife was sitting on the bed, hands on her belly. The dead body was face down on the floor. I tried to ask her what happened but she actually was asleep and only woke up 5 min after that. She has no idea the body fell on the floor. Later she told me the weird dream she had: A toddler she identified as our daughter was running in a smokey corridor. She heard cries and calls for help coming from the doors around. \n\nWe didn't recall this episode when our daughter acted strangely lately, but now it's striking us. Once again you don't have to believe me, I know I would have not believe it from someone else. \n\nThank you for your time",

She was right next to me, almost on top of me. \n\nWe weren’t moving, she was moving her arms singing to a song on tv but other than that no big movements.\n\nAt the end of my bed it literally moved, you heard the springs, and the sensation of someone plopping down on the bed. I didn’t react, but my tot definitely looked at me in a concerning way..kinda like\n “Mom didn’t you see that?” Type of look on her face. \n\nI’m ignoring. But there have been some weird situations happening since I moved here and it’s a fairly new building (built within the last 3-8 years) I believe something around that time frame. \n\nI did research and to my knowledge no one has died in my apartment. \n\nWhat would one make of this? Can you try to debunk it? \n\nI made another post but deleted about an experience I had home alone one time, and I clearly heard a whisper in my ear (left ear if that matters) “help me” my tv was on at the time but was paused (the Netflix account asking if I’m still watching) so technically there was no noise. \nYou do hear the neighbors next door but never talking, you can only hear them banging things around really loudly or someone stomping up and down their stairs or moving peices of furniture, i never hear my neighbors voices through the walls. This was very clear, whisper, right in my ear. \n\n\nThen there was a weird dishwasher situation, I was loading the dishes and utensils, I had one more spoon to load, I turn around to grab it, and it’s not there..mind you I’ve been turning around and grabbing things and mentally making notes to load the dishwasher efficiently, so I was keeping track, and I know there was a spoon on my counter that I left, and when I turned around to grab it it wasn’t there, confused I went back to close the dishwasher and it was in the dishwasher. \n\nAnd lastly the stairs. Before these weird situations happening here and there ever started, the stairs have always weirded me out. When I go up then I get the overwhelming feeling that someone is watching me, and sometimes right behind me as I go up, of course no one is there and I just dismiss it as me being completely insane and losing it. \nSometimes I even run up the stairs to get it over with. \n\n\n\nPlease attempt to realistically debunk this. \nYou can even suggest schizophrenia. \nLol but jokes aside, seriously, what’s happening.",

        "text": "In 2017 I participated in a cross-country bike trip across the Northwestern United States, during which time I had many strange and alarming premonitions or “time-slip” experiences. One of the most notable and largest-scale visions I had was of an enourmous earthquake and tsunami that would happen in the as far inland as the area of semi-central Oregon through which I was riding. I the earthquake vision, I saw the entire surrounding forest topple because of how far in one direction the ground moved from beneath the trees, many meters. In the tsunami vision, I saw that the hills in view were washed over by a tsunami of enourmous proportions, and only later did I learn through reading of the predicted Cascadia fault line mega quake and resulting tsunami, which are long overdue, by the geologic timescale of the recurrence of the quakes of that fault. I had the sense that those events would occur in a very few years, relatively speaking, felt less than a decade out, but I don’t know, definitely “contemporary” to this generation, though. Let me know if anyone has had any similar experience or would be interested to hear about any more of these experiences, I have heard that the year 2017 was very “paranormally” active for many people’s experience.",

        "text": "\nSometimes I get a strange feeling wash over me. It is like I am doing and experiencing the same thing exactly as before, like I've gone back in time or forward or across parallel time. A warm / hot sensation flows through my viens, I feel lightheaded / dizzy and get at least one ZAP in my brain. The zap seems to go from my temples to deep into the centre of my head.\n\nWhile in this state my memories are not mine, well not in the reality I came from, but do feel like they are mine for where I am now. I don't know how I got here but it starts to feel comfortable like I should be here. I feel like I have swapped my essence with another version of myself in a parallel existence. The strangeness lessens, I feel warm and safe and start to examine the memories and feelings of this me. \n\nAfter a while the strange dizzyness and brain zaps reoccur, I feel like ice is in my blood and suddenly I'm back in my normal life but, no time has past, I'm back to just before the strange feelings started.\n\nThese episodes are generally unpredictable and the only correlation I've noted is that they occur more often if I'm unwell or have a temperature. Sometimes I get a feeling that an episode is going to happen before it does. Sometimes I can bring on an episode by rembering and thinking about a previous one.\n\nIt's hard to describe this, it's worrying and I don't know why it happens or what it means. It's like I have more than one existence and I briefly jump between them. Could it be possession,  brain tumor, epilepsy or what ?",

If everybody on the planet was only good, would we all die of old age? Are we MEANT to only die of old age/natural causes? And another question if you’re interested…does the soul feel the same way the body feels when it comes to emotions? Like if I’m sad, I can feel the sadness in my body. My heart hurts etc. Can the soul “feel” without a body? Anybody get what I’m trying to ask? I’m a thinker and have no one to share my thoughts with.",

        "text": "The memory of these events ís still clear years later. It really frightened me at the time but looking back it wasn't evil at all, it just wanted to play and seemed lonely. Í think it could have been the spirit of a child itself.\n\nWhen I was 8 my bedroom and bed were arranged such that if I lay on my left-hand side I cound see the landing and stairs. My bedroom was adjacent to the bathroom and toilet so I could see when people went up and down stairs and to the bathroom. \n\nI had a 4 year old sister and a new born brother. My sister had her own bedroom and baby slept in parents bedroom. My sister would go to bed at least an hour before me and the landing light would be left on until parents went to bed.\n\nOne night I was lying on my right hand side trying to go to sleep when I felt a poke in my back. I span round and saw a small dark shadow run out of my room, across the landing and down the stairs. I presumed that it was my little sister so I went downstairs and complained to my mom and dad that she had poked me and how come she was still up. Mom took me back upstairs and showed me that sis was still asleep in bed. I thought she must of snook back into her bed but she was deeply asleep.\n\nFollowing nights I tried to always lay on my left so that I could see who was poking me. Nothing happened so I went back to normal. A few nights later the poking happened again. I jumped out of bed ran into my sisters room and shouted at her to stop poking me. This woke her up and she started screaming and crying. I was told off my mom and sent back to bed. As I lay there watching the door I saw the small dark shadow slowly slip through the door, cross the landing and head down the stairs.\n\nEvery now and then, when I lay on my right the poking would happen again and I'd see the shadow running away. I tried to tell my parents but they thought that I must have been dreaming, but I knew I wasn't.  This continued sparodicaly until my brother needed his own bedroom and I moved to a new bedroom in the loft space. My sister moved into my old bedroom and he moved into her old  bedroom.\n\nBizarrely years later at her wedding reception she told the story of me tormenting her by poking her in back some nights when she was trying to go to sleep in my old bedroom. I never did this. Was it the same small dark shadow?",

Of course I didn't say anything and kept eating while watching the movie, but every so and then I turned around to see if she or something else was there, I felt like I was being watched the whole time, and since then, nothing happened till I was 11 I believe, now I see and feel them all the time, I'm currently 16 but in a few months I'm turning 17.",
