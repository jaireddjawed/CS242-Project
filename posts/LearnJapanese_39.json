        "text": "I’ve seen it numerous times where the text of a question is removed because it wasn’t in the daily thread. These posts often attract great answers, so it’s very unfortunate for future generations of learners who have those same questions that the question text gets deleted. Can it just be locked/archived with a message about posting in the daily thread instead? At least that way, users will be motivated to use the daily thread, because their question gets locked, and then questions that have already attracted great answers regardless won’t be obfuscated by [removed].",

For that matter, if anyone knows any reliable sources for Japanese game scripts, for other games like Ni No Kuni (that I have too) and Dragon Quest 11 (another game I'm looking at getting in Japanese) that'd be great, I'm just trying to have fun on my Japanese journey and if you haven't seen Game Gengo, he's the reason I started playing games to learn Japanese and his channel is an amazing resource, but yeah I just couldn't find anywhere that actually does game scripts in Japanese and was wondering if anyone else knew, or had solved the problem, thanks a bunch!",

        "text": "Basically, when I first started my Japanese I had a lot less responsibility and commitment, which allowed me to essentially work freely at whatever I felt like I needed at that moment. Sometimes I would neglect things but ultimately it served me pretty well.\n\nHowever, since learning my life has changed drastically and no I feel like I can no longer afford to whimsically go about my learning in this way. Furthermore, I also had a lot more time whereas now I will not due to starting work, starting College in the near future, and time for other hobbies and responsibilities. And now I feel like I can no longer afford to not only because of the less time, but I feel like I am sacrificing Japanese more and more because I don't have a routine for learning. I simply put it off or procrastinate for other important (or sometimes not so important) things.\n\nI have planned out a loose schedule for how I think things will fall when I am working and studying, and I think I will be able to dedicate around 10-11 hours a week towards learning minimum. Sometimes I will dedicate more when motivation and free time is high, but I want a baseline so that I am intaking new information while also not forgetting the old. The 10-11 hours won't include things such as translating Japanese books or consuming Japanese media. Primarily practice. Such as writing, reading exercises, and also learning new vocab and N3 grammar. Right now my study mostly consists of sporadically using Anki and also doing exercises on Satori reader. I also want to start using LangCorrect and also WaniKani.\n\nOf course, if everyone where to do something like this, then no two routines would be the same. I'm mostly looking for general tips and advice for people who have done this, pitfalls to avoid etc. Thanks for reading.",

        "text": "I'm not entirely sure if this fits the sub, but I wanted to share it in case anyone else is interested in surnames.\n\n[Myoji Yurai](https://myoji-yurai.net/) is a website that aims to be a database of all Japanese surnames, including history and meanings, readings, location data, family crests (kamon), number-related statistics (ie how many people roughly have the surname), etc. The site claims to have 99.04% of surnames documented.\n\nThe site menu has the following headings:\n\n* Search, which is just a link to the main page (see below).\n* [Basic knowledge](https://myoji-yurai.net/basicKnowledge.htm) and understanding of how Japanese surnames work.\n* [Popularity rankings](https://myoji-yurai.net/prefectureRanking.htm)\n* [Rare and unusual kanji](https://myoji-yurai.net/rareNameTop.htm) that you can search surnames for.\n* A link to another website about surname-related news and statistics.\n* [Reference materials](https://myoji-yurai.net/reference.htm) in case you're interested about learning more than what the website has to offer.\n\nThe sidebars:\n\nLeft:\n\n* みんなの名字の由来 shows a list of newly-submitted name origins and histories. Click the link below for a full list, sorted by newest first.\n* 名字の基礎知識コラム shows the latest columns written by the site. Click the link below for a full list, which is also sorted by newest first.\n* みんなの家紋のはなし shows the latest submissions about kamon, Japanese family crests. Click the link below for a full list.\n* ニュースリリース shows you the latest news and information about the database.\n* サイト内のおすすめ shows you recommended articles about the website.\n* 新着・更新 is a list of newly submitted and updated surnames.\n* 情報求む seems to be a list of surnames missing information that people have put in requests for.\n* 名字関連ニュース is a list of news articles about surnames.\n* There are two sections for phone apps. In order, they are: Android (free), iPhone (free)\n\nRight:\n\n* アクセスランキング shows you the most searched for surnames by day (left) and month (right). Click on either link below to see more than the top ten (the first is daily, the second is monthly).\n* 誕生日の有名人 shows you 5 random Japanese celebrities celebrating their birthday today. Click on their name to learn more about them and their surname. Clilck the link below for the full list.\n* 本日の有名人アクセスランキング is a list of celebrities by search popularity. It resets daily. Clilck the link below for the full list.\n* 同姓同名アクセスランキング is a list of how many people share the same surname **and** given name by search popularity. Clilck the link below for the full list.\n* あなたの家系図 専門調査できる？  seems to be something about family tree information.\n* 名字おみくじ is surname fortune telling. See how lucky your surname is!\n* 誰が何をした日？is an \"on this day in history\" field.\n* 名字伝言板(掲示板)盛り上がりランキング lists popular threads on the message board.\n\nFor starters, it's best to stick to just looking up surnames. Enter a name you want to search for in the  名字(漢字) field. The options below are translated as follows:\n\n* 名字で By surname kanji (entire)\n* 読み方で By surname reading (partial)\n* 名字で (一部文字で) By surname kanji (partial)\n* 読み方で (完全一致) By surname reading\n\nFor example, if you wanted to search the surname Maeda, but only knew the hiragana, you would write まえだ into the field and select 読み方で (完全一致), [it shows you](https://myoji-yurai.net/resultList.htm?kind=%E8%AA%AD%E3%81%BF%E6%96%B9%28%E5%AE%8C%E5%85%A8%E4%B8%80%E8%87%B4%29&amp;keyword=%E3%81%BE%E3%81%88%E3%81%A0) a list of all the surnames that can be read as Maeda.\n\nIt then displays a table:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n| 名字(読み)| 全国人数| 全国順位|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Name (reading)|Number of people in Japan with the surname|Popularity ranking|\n|(NOTE: Many surnames have several readings, and these are cut off by  … -- click on the name to see all the readings)|(NOTE:  約 means \"roughly\", as these statistics most likely aren't 100% accurate)|Shows where the surname ranks against other surnames in terms of how many people bear it|\n\nIf you click on a name, you get taken to its page. Let's use [Maeda](https://myoji-yurai.net/searchResult.htm?myojiKanji=%E5%89%8D%E7%94%B0) again for this example.\n\nThe first section has the info displayed on the search result page: readings, popularity ranking, number of people (in that order).\n\nBelow that, there's a section titled 【名字の由来解説】, or \"Explanation of the surname's origin\". This is a bit more complex as it describes the origin and history of the surname, as well as famous historical figures with connections to the surname. Click on 続きはこちら (\"Continuation is here,\", which is just the same as \"Read more\") to read the full article.\n\nThe map shows the distribution of the surname throughout Japan, along with a breakdown of instances by prefecture.\n\n前田さんの多い地域 TOP5 (\"TOP5 areas with the most Maeda-sans\") lists the prefectures and the cities with the highest number of people named Maeda(-san), while 前田さんの比率が多い地域 TOP5 (\"TOP5 areas with the highest percentages of Maeda-sans\") has the same data but by percentage instead.\n\n前田さん有名人アクセスランキング (\"Maeda-san celebrity access ranking\") TOP10 is a list of Japanese celebrities with the surname. It only lists the top ten most popular celebs, but if you click on the 前田さん有名人一覧 (\"List of celebrities named Maeda-san\") button below it, it shows you a complete list.\n\n【戦国武将・大名の家紋】 (\"Sengoku (Era) Military Commander &amp; Feudal Lord \\[Daimyou\\] kamon\") shows a gallery of kamon, Japanese family crests, that are connected to the surname. Click on the image of the kamon to learn more about it.\n\n前田さん みんなの名字の由来 (\"Maeda-san: Everyone's surname origin\") is a section for visitors of the website to share any information they have on the history and origin of the surname. In the case of Maeda, nobody has submitted anything yet.\n\nみんなの名字の由来 投稿 (\"Everyone's surname origin: submission\") is where you can submit your own info, but you need an account to do so.\n\n前田さん みんなの家紋のはなし (\"Maeda-san: Everyone's kamon stories\") is a sections for visitors of the website to share any information they have about their family's own kamon that are connected to the surname.\n\nBelow that is a disclaimer about the website's accuracy and how it stores data, along with another search input field.\n\nThen there's a list of surnames that have been searched for recently. The link above just takes you to a page where you can join their premium membership service to gain access to more search features (I presume).\n\n前田さん(男の子)の名づけ (\"Maeda-san (boy) names\") and 前田さん(女の子)の名づけ (\"Maeda-san (girl) names\") take you to another website where you can look at baby names in combination for the surname in question.\n\nAfterwards there's another section to search kamon.\n\nLastly, there's a bunch of links to articles and lists that the site is trying to promote. Of interest, [the first](https://myoji-yurai.net/rareNameTop.htm) is a directory for rare/uncommon surname kanji you can look up.\n\nAnd the page finishes off with another search input field.\n\nThe main page also has 家紋検索 (kamon search), 同姓同名検索 (same surname/given name search), 文献・古文書検索 (reference material search), 名字おみくじ (surname fortune telling), and a large section with a detailed history of the website, as well as its goals.\n\nPlease let me know if I've missed anything or if you have any questions about the site that I didn't cover here! I love Japanese names and find them extremely fascinating for some reason. Also, my Japanese isn't perfect so I may have misunderstood what one of the sections listed is about. If that's the case, feel free to correct me.\n\nThis site can also be useful for looking up surnames you come across in things you're watching/reading if you don't know their reading (although, as you'll quickly learn from this, you should never, ever guess how a surname is read! Looking at you, [丹生](https://myoji-yurai.net/searchResult.htm?myojiKanji=%E4%B8%B9%E7%94%9F)...). Alternatively, it could be good if you're creating original characters who are Japanese/have Japanese surnames, whether to give you ideas or checking to see if the surname you have in mind is real (not that it matters in fiction).",

Trying to play along in your head is also a fun production exercise\n\n* Instead of a simple vocab list, Japanese Family Feud they *also* have pictures to go along with the answers, which is not only super cute but good context clues\n\n* Since the contestants have to stop and think about their answer and also enunciate clearly for the host and audience, the speech is fairly slow and clear.\n\n* The prize money and points are good number listening practice and since you see it written ont he screen it's good for getting those man's and okus down.\n\n* Also it's honestly just entertaining. They play super dramatic suspense music before revealing the answer, the intros are super corny in the say any old TV gameshow across the world is, and most importantly the host is really lively and fun to watch even if he doesn't have the nuclear-level Steve Harvey meltdowns when someone says something that's already up there.\n\nSo yeah, that's a fun comprehensible find to get a little practice in. Sadly nobody's screamed ちんちん! いい答える！いい答える！ yet but a man can dream. Keep an eye out for the amazing YKK Zipper commercial, like damn I didn't know people were so ignorant of zippers that a commercial for them needed to air, but there ya go. Have fun everyone!",

I've genuinely seen someone say that since he passed the N5 he knew \"20% of japanese\". \n\nThe N3 includes around 500 kanji and 3500 words, while the N1 has 2100 kanji and 10k+ words, a huge difference, especially because kanji get less useful and more complicated as they go, so they get much harder to learn. So you can say that you know 1/4 of them, but you're like 1/8 of the way through. \n\nSo as an N3 learner you still haven't even reached the everlasting \"intermediate hell\". You're still a beginner.",

They seem pretty advanced to me, am I barking at the wrong tree here? Is there any other source of news or native like material that I can use to bridge that gap?\n\nJust for reference, I’m sitting at around N3 in terms of grammar and vocabulary, don’t know if that helps.",

While I have been doing this for several years, to my embarrassment I have to admit that I only recently learned about old kana and the differences between old kana and the post-1945 period.\n\n I am somewhat surprised that I did not learn about this earlier. My understanding is that this might be because the differences between old and new kana are primarily important for pronunciation and as I primarily read Kanji heavy Japanese without furigana, I might not have noticed because of this reason? Is my understanding correct?\n\nAlso, on a related note, I understand that one of the differences is that old kana has no small kana. When reading current academic texts from today, i also noticed that few small kana appear. Does this have to do with the fact that academic texts are also Kanji heavy and small kana are often used for the spelling of words that can also be written with kanji only?\n\nThanks for any suggestions/help!",

        "text": "I'm talking about textbooks and lessons etc. I've seen flashcards and immersion mostly recommended online. I've been using Italki teachers since I started learning this year but also switched between nearly all the methods I found. \n\nAfter having found a good professional Italki teacher I think that's the best for me overall. Flashcards are also good for kanji and vocabulary but they don't give you the nuances of them. I have to use flashcards for genki's lists, or practice using them, or I forget. \n\nPersonally I think the teacher has been the most effective for me. She can explain well, give feedback and answer questions. I learn and practice new and old content with her which I feel is a complete course. The thing is it's pricey so can't afford to do it for hours a day like immersion. So I'm limited to around 2-5 hours a week.\n\nBut I want to know if anyone has gotten to an advcaned level with books, a teacher etc, but without much immersion. Methods like the refold one act like traditional methods are a waste of time and immersion is all you really need, with maybe some flashcards for vocab. I assume eventually you have to interact with the full langauge as that's the goal but I'm not a big fan of immersing with video because I have nothing tangible I can say I learnt at the end of it, except maybe a couple words that i'll forget then relearn when they get used again.",

        "text": "Hello all,\n\n  \nBack in September, I finally managed to get started in Waseda's Japanese Language Program for a semester! As exciting as it's been to live in Japan, I feel like I'm noticing some dissonance in my learning style and the JLP's structure, so I wanted to get some ideas on how I can navigate from here to get the best learning experience for the rest of the term.  \n\n\nFor background, I have been self-studying JP for 3 years, with the first 2 consisting of rigorous flashcard usage, and the third mostly being natural exposure to the language through reading novels/manga, watching anime with JP subtitles, and using some N2 JLPT textbooks to introduce myself to more complex grammar structures. I can understand some difficult subject matter when read, and if I'm given time I can write some average-to-good sentences. I've practiced speaking to myself a lot, so I can convey ideas in speech a lot of the time, even if it isn't completely correct. My weakest area is listening comprehension, but the more time I actively try to do things around Japan I've been gradually picking it up a bit more. And if anyone has been in the JLP before, for reference I tested into category 5, just barely falling short of 6.  \n\n\nOn to the questions:   \n1. How can I better learn from my mistakes?   \nSince I was a self-study, I've built quite a few bad habits in my writing/speech style that I can't quite break, and I'm having a hard time telling exactly what they are in addition. If I was still self-studying, I'd just keep increasing my input through more reading to help build a better sense of the language, but now that I have so many classes to keep up in I haven't been doing much more than 2-3 hours of leisure reading/watching/listening per week.   \nAdded to that, the teachers I have at Waseda tend to fall into two categories: the ones that get super nitpicky and correct sentences in front of the class, and the ones that don't do any corrections. It's pretty crushing knowing I won't get high marks in my classes with the nitpicky teachers, but it's so much harder to learn what I did wrong when I'm taking the heat in the middle of class or I get back papers with tons of red question marks and cross-outs that don't describe anything/provide alternative vocab or grammar.  \n\n\n2. What are some good methods to balance language ego?  \nWhen I think ego I tend to think of it negatively, but I genuinely think it's important to have a good balance of confidence and humility in building language skills. As mentioned before, it's a little frustrating to be told I'm wrong when I think something is right, but if I keep expecting myself to be wrong I start to slip into a fear of applying more unique language patterns and I can find myself slipping back into only saying basic AはBです patterns, or worse yet messing up even that simple of a sentence.   \nIs it a better strategy to employ basic language usage in times where I'm under high-stress (such as timed writing or performing a speech), or should I always be trying to use new grammar/vocab choices no matter what? I'm sure this is a pretty broad question and comes down the the person, but I was curious if anyone has had to deal with such issues before.  \n\n\n3. How to handle skill disparity competently?  \nWith being in such a high level of Japanese in the JLP, most of my peers have been with the school longer than I, meaning that there are set expectations in class that I have yet to adjust to. Primarily, the teachers often speak quite fast and expect students to work through content quickly, where there are times that I feel unable to keep up. The subject matter is also quite heavy, leading into deeper ideas like politics and philosophy. Given more time and rereads I find myself understanding, but not to the level of my peers, who I tend to struggle keeping conversations with once we go into breakout groups.  \nThis kind of pressure has been forcing me into doubling my homework load, spending extra time reviewing the content of upcoming lectures just to make sure I understand everything correctly. One could say that's good practice in itself, but I would much prefer putting that time into areas such as expanding my vocabulary pool or practicing more grammar so I can read through the content easier from the get-go.  \nTLDR: what would be the most effective ways of \"faking it until I make it\" in terms of matching the abilities of my peers?  \n\n\nApologies for the long-winded nature of this post. Consider it some slight ranting from 5 weeks of struggle. Going from a 3.8 GPA at American college to 70% averages hasn't been a good feeling, but I don't want that to hold me back from getting the best results while I'm here for such a short time.

When you learn new grammar points in a textbook, how do you practice it properly? I can write lots of different sentences with the grammar, but maybe what I write doesn't make complete sense, or it might just be wrong. How do you go about doing this if you don't have someone to check your work? I don't want to be picking up bad habits from studying the wrong way without knowing I'm doing it wrong.",
