        "text": "As the title relates, today is the anniversary of *Frankenstein*’s publication. Hard to believe how much of impact that book had and still has—on a macro level as well as micro, personal level. \n\n*Frankenstein* is (probably) my favorite book; so much so, that I’ve started collecting various copies of the book simply because I love the differences each has, but even despite the unique covers, the story remains untouchable. It really feels like a work of literary perfection and one that holds a dear place in my life. \n\nAs a senior in high school, I was enrolled in one of those duel-credit English courses. In this course, we read a lot of canonical work which included *Frankenstein*. During this time I was searching for a college and a major. I settled on a school and declared I would study Economics. I ended up visiting the business college of said school and absolutely hated the experience. The classmates were rude and cartoonish. The professors were apathetic. And the business college administration seemed to play favorites. It was one of the worst experiences like that I’d ever had (as a side note, a good friend of mine went with my on this trip and ultimately ended up at that university only to verify all the thoughts I had).\n\nSo, I returned home unsure of myself and my future. I thought of what classes I loved to go to and I realized the only passion I had for classes were my English IV course and being a T.A. for my Freshmen (favorite) teacher. I thought about how much I loved *Frankenstein*, how I could talk about the nuances of the book for ages—just the hidden depth in literature—this is when I knew English was the route for me. \n\nHere I am, a few semesters from graduating my undergrad  and moving on to grad school and it’s all because *Frankenstein* has such a profound impact on me. \n\nSo here’s to you, *Frankenstein*. Happy Birthday, friend. ",

        "text": "William Shakespeare is widely regarded as the single greatest writer in the history of English literature. Reading his work, it's easy to see why people think that. However, it's baffling from a statistical perspective.\n\nEL as we know it today began, roughly speaking, with Geoffrey Chaucer (I'm sure that's a simplification, but it got us through A-level). If we ask what fraction of the authors since then predate Shakespeare, it has to be hardly any, because it's a fraction of the post-Chaucer history, and because since then the world population, fraction of it speaking English, and fraction of Anglophones who were literate have all skyrocketed.  If all would-be-Greatest-Writer candidates had the same chance, it'd almost certainly be someone much more recent than the Bard.\n\nBut actually, early people were at two further disadvantages: the small market for their work was less of an incentive in an era when literacy was a path to other great jobs, and they had fewer giants' shoulders to stand on. The obvious advantage Shakespeare's successors had over him was that they could draw inspiration from his past work.\n\nSo given these facts, why hasn't anyone been able to dislodge Shakespeare, or at least make \"he's the best\" a more contentious standpoint? I'll offer my thoughts because r/literature discussions require the OP to do that, but I'm sure other people here will have much better ideas than mine (that's why I'm asking).\n\nWhen we call writers great, we're often talking about influence as much as or more than the \"quality\" (whatever that is) of their writing. When you're the ultimately most influential author from an early era, with very few contemporaries compared to the writing pool of today, you could easily have more reach than anyone thereafter. Unless everyone for the next century starts reshaping their writing style to learn from J K Rowling, his influence will be hard to beat.\n\nOr maybe he's the permanent pinnacle because he invented or reinvented so many different genres in his plays. (I remember one Reddit post explaining that what made him so great is that he mastered or even created so many different kinds of play.) In an era when there weren't that many examples of each to learn from, doing something innovative with each of them was a lot more achievable than it would be today, when our best living writers may manage that in one or two genres at best.",

        "text": "Hermann Hesse's \"The Steppenwolf\" is a fascinating piece of work dealing with Identity crisis, loneliness, suicide, etc... It has easily become one of my favourite novels and I'm planning to read more of Hesses works.\n\nWhenever I find a great book, I always try and find and as much as I can about the author and I couldn't help noticing that Hermann Hesse and Harry Haller (The Steppenwolf) have a lot in common; both are 50 years old, had suicidal thoughts, criticized the war (World War I) and have the same initials (H.H).\n\nIt is always interesting to see how authors insert themselves into their characters and I wonder if there are more similarities between them that I have missed.\n\nAt any rate, I highly recommend \"The Steppenwolf\". A friend of mine recommended it to me and, while the beginning did feel boring, I am glad I sticked to it.\n",
