Long story short, an attorney I used to work with started his own firm with a partner recently. I got lunch with them last week and they essentially gave me a sales pitch to join their firm and a very loose job offer. I know the attorney well and he‚Äôs a great guy. However, I want to circle back with them and ask for a written offer. I did not get many details and want/need them so I can begin to compare options.\n\nSo, can anyone, from experience or otherwise, please inform me as to what the standard contents of a written job offer are. That way I can circle back to them asking for a written offer with all of those details in it.\n\nI know this probably sounds stupid but no one in my family is an attorney and I do not have any attorney friends to rely upon.\n\nThank you!",

I got into 3rd round interviews with many big firms, 2 of which flew me around the country to just meet with senior partners. They would always trick me into revealing some personal information and I was too dumb to realize what they were doing. \n\nIn one instance, they had a woman who had just given birth 6 months before and pretty much goaded me with all her pictures and videos of her baby into telling her I had a toddler. I was like, omg female bonding! Nope! She then said it would be really hard to work at the firm and if I were ready to do it.  She never asked me about my personal life. She talked about hers and it made me feel uncomfortable not sharing mine. I'm an idiot. \n\nAll of my final round interviews (5 in total) happened within 8 days of each other.  They all rejected me.  \n\nI have to admit, I was bitter. But F them.

My closed memo is shit compared to my open memo, but my open memo is 15 pages long bcuz it involved two contested elements. I‚Äôd much rather use this open memo opposed to my closed one but I‚Äôm having a hard time trying to figure out what to get rid of to shorten it. Facts, maybe the element B section, etc. \n\nMy general understanding is that the sample should be 5-10 pages. \n\nI was wondering if anyone has advice on this? My school‚Äôs workshop for this topic doesn‚Äôt start until next week but I have an application due over the weekend so I haven‚Äôt gotten any guidance from my school just yet. \n\nThank you all in advance!",

I‚Äôm really proud of how hard he‚Äôs been working, and I love him very much. \n\nI was just hoping to get advice on how I can best support him, especially with grades pending. I can relate to him to a certain extent, since my Ph.D. program is challenging, but my knowledge of law school and its unique stressors is limited. He is such a caring, attentive, and supportive partner, and I want to help him in ways that are actually useful. That being said: What would you have appreciated from your loved ones during 1L, or law school generally? What would‚Äôve made a difference when you were in 1L for making you feel supported? What would have helped with soothing your anxieties about grades? Are there any gifts, surprises, or ways to help that would make a difference in the experience of a 1L? \n\nWe live together, so I‚Äôve been leaving notes for encouragement, surprising him with homemade lunch, and trying to absorb as much information about what he‚Äôs working on. I just figured it would be best to get insight from those who know best.\n\nTLDR: How can I best support and show appreciation to my partner who is in 1L? What would you have appreciated when in 1L?

The hierarchy of the administration of my private, lowly ranked law school is pressing against what may be my chance at job offers where I can rub shoulders with people who went to higher ranked law schools with better reputations in this highly desirable city/legal market I am situated in. Because of this \"situation,\" no one in my section gets a grade and our only options to get a grade are to take the final examination in another class. With this \"remedy,\" however, the black box administration is saying that we may only watch course recording videos, but not attend the lecture. \n\nBasically, this is not just a let-me-bitch-about-my-situation post. As a law student who throughly neurotic, I am considering what having a \"credit\" as opposed to a grade my indicate on my transcript. Again, I attend a low ranked law school in a desirable city. There are a good handful of other law schools in this city, all of which are ranked higher and have better reputations than the school I attend. I have already applied to federal judicial externships and jobs of a similar caliber, but will having a \"credit\" on my transcript as opposed to a grade indicate some sort of ineptitude? Other sources are saying that overall GPA is the only thing that matters, but as a law student from this lower ranked school, doesn't every small aspect of who I am on paper matter? Every grade? Every experience? Why did I talk through flames only to be left staring at the administrative black box? Why did I work so hard for a \"credit\"? \n\nPlease tell me what to do. I have no idea if I should just keep the \"credit\" option on my transcript or attempt to take the video-recording-only class and then take the final with a will and a prayer to the stars? Of course I will work diligently, but I will not be present in the classroom. I will just be sitting behind my screen trying to turn my \"credit\" into a grade.",
