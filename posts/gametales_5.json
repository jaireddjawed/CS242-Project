        "text": "One of my few stints as a player, but most definitely against my will. One of the things I need to be up front about before you read this is my hatred for harry potter. I hate the series and I preferr things that weren't filled with plot holes. But the guy DMing this loved harry potter, so much so that he bent a system that was never designed for combat backwards in order to allow us to use it to do a hogwarts school setting campaign with the rest of the group as young wizards.\n\nHe dragged me into this because he thought he could convince me that harry potter was great, that, and he needed a third player. The guy pestered me for a week before I caved and joined, but I was determined to make my own fun.\n\nWe had three people in our group. Ellie Cranston, a muggle born who was really smart \\(Hermione by any other name\\). Duncan von wolfgang, a german exchange student who was really good looking but pretty stupid. Then there was me, Rolf McCormack, An irish wizard who came from a well off mage family. I purposefully went for this because that way no one could bloody understand me half the time, but my magic would still work. Rolf was also multi\\-lingual, speaking 10 different languages, letting me shift accents on the fly if desired, and had a good enough understanding of law to get a doctorate if he wanted to. More on those later.\n\nThe game started out as normal, first year, get stuck under the sorting hat, it asked us questions before sending us off to our house. Originally we were all going to be stuck in the same house, gryffindor, but when the hat asked me questions, i spoke to it in parseltongue, landing me in slytherin. This pissed off the DM a little, but I wanted to be in the cool kids club, not the scrub club. After we all got sorted and ate our meals together, the group split up and we went to our dorms. The other guys in my house were kinda assholes...Until i threatened to straight up murder one of them by tossing them off the turning stair cases as it moved. After that I then dealt with the next bully by threatening him with wizardry law, in no short terms explaining to him that i could get his muggle mother killed if the government deemed it 'appropriate action'. Whether or not there was a law for it didn't matter, I rolled well enough to make him believe it. I got the respect of the older years for basically being as cruel and apathetic as possible, and those of my own year stopped trying to bully me after the first few days, due to one specific incident.\n\nThe classes were set up to be mixed house, so we all got to go to classes together. Despite being a psycho to everyone else, I followed my standard table etiquette and was tolerable/nice to the other players and their characters. It was a little out of character, but I'd rather be a bit out of character and have everyone enjoy the game with no punishments, than ruin the game for everyone by doing the \"its what my character would do\" thing. First lesson was mandrakes, standard scene from the book/movie, except I wore earplugs as well as headphones. Good thing to, because one of the other slytherin kids tried to knock my headphones off while we were potting our plant, and i just smiled at him, potted my plant and then said \"I hope it was worth the risk, I'll be sure to take my turn soon enough.\" Fatass spat in my face, got kicked out of lesson for it, our house lost points cos of him. The house nearly turned on me, but after a few good rolls, i convinced them it was fatso's fault, but to let me deal with it for the glory of the house.\n\nThe DM was worried about what I was doing, as his game was getting way darker than he expected, even though the other two were having a jolly old time of it when it was their turn. In short, the kid who spat on me \\(we shall keep referring to him as fatass\\), got his just desserts one night when he went to the bathroom. There is a steven king book called Dreamcatcher, where snake like aliens basically worm up a persons ass and kill them. When fatass went to the bathroom, he got attacked by his own pet snake in the bathroom, which then lodged itself up his ass. He was never seen again in the campaign, so i assume the trauma was too much for him to bare, and the DM had given up trying to bully Rolf at that point.\n\nWhen it came time to learn spells, things got fun, because I also had a decent amount of skill in theft. The lesson went as normal, but i then proceeded to steal a copy of the teachers spellbook. In my free time, when I wasn't out with the other two on mini adventures, i was studying the spell textbooks, pulling all nighters repeatedly and using a potion we learned from class to help me stay fully rested with only 4 hours of sleep \\(It should have been one hour, but i didn't do so great on the alchemy roll\\). The DM made one last attempt to mess with me using my own house mates, the typical \"ha ha, look at the nerd, what a fuckin' nerd!\". Which ended after the kid had his mouth burned shut. Not sown or sealed, burned shut. Its amazing how brutal medical magic can be, gotta cauterize those wounds.\n\nThis was a bit too far though, and I got lorded over by one of the teachers \\(not snape or anything like that, this was post books apparently\\). I rolled to pretend I looked like i cared, fucking nat one \\(In call of cthulhu terms, that's the best possible outcome\\), the guy bought that i cared, let me off with a warning and sent me back to my room. The next day I had to go see the teachers and they basically forced me into gryffindor because I was apparently 'causing too much trouble'. So now you had the kid with a reputation for taking no shit and burning people's mouths shut, in the house all about honour and courage.\n\nI didn't really argue against it, because as a DM myself most of the time, I understood it made things easier, but from a roleplay standpoint it pissed me off because i was having actual fun in the slytherin house, even had a few NPC friends, one was a kid who knew martial arts. Despite this change, the game did go a bit smoother, with the three of us going on a few more small adventures during our free time, nothing of note until the day i suggested we get some more spellbooks. We snuck into the library and stole a few books from the next year up, and the year after. While the other two couldn't roll well enough to learn the magic, I was able to easily enough, and once again binged spell study.\n\nThe only thing Rolf sucked at was brooms, he only ever pottered about on them, not being able to zip about like the other two. This made things difficult when we got our first big adventure inside the forbidden forest. One of our classmates, a girl that Wolfgang was crushing hard on, had ran into them late in the night, and we had to go save her ass, but to catch up we used our brooms. The other two did ok, but I was stuck on the tricycle equivalent of one, drifting behind at a slow pace...This was where the DM had either intended to have a cool scripted event, or Legit wanted to kill me.\n\nAs we were split up, a black shadow slammed into me, knocking me off of my broom before dragging me to the forest floor. There were spiders all around us and he tried to choke me out, stopping me from casting spells. So I say \"I silently cast a spell to 'disarm' him, specifically taking his wand.\" I roll to pull it off, manage it. Though not without some bickering about 'silent casting', but with the movies at my back, I win the debate. I then force him to let go of my throat just long enough to utter a single spell word, casting it through \\*his\\* wand. \" Avada Kedavra.\" The table goes silent.\n\nThere is a second argument, but after pulling up the wiki, I show him that in order to use the spell, you must simply speak its name, with the intent to kill, and it is cast, no prior training needed. So, I kill him, then, I snap his wand before tucking it into his pocket. I then explain why I did that to the others, so the teachers think that he got killed by someone else, and the reason i used his wand to begin with is so they couldn't trace the spell back to my wand. I then shot out a magic flare, drawing the teachers to me in an instant, rolled to pretend like i was crying, fucking nailed it. The other two were able to use the distraction i created to fly back to school.\n\nThe girl Wolfgang liked never showed up, I got away with straight up murder, undeniable proof death eaters were still around had been giftrapped to the government. Even if i was found out to be the guy that killed him, I had the law on my side to defend me, self defence against a death eater was totally legal. I got the whole schools respect for surviving a death eater attack. I was the boy who lived, I was Rolf McCormack.",

        "text": "This is the tale of the worst character to grace my table, not bad as in \"that guy\" bad or because he was chaotic evil or something like that. Bad as in every stat he had was 3, 3 strength, 3 charisma, 3 everything. Why wasn't this guy re\\-rolled for something better? Because the player \\(we'll call him eddy\\) thought it would be funny to see what it would be like to sit on the opposite end of the broken spectrum.\n\nThus, benny Stallone was born, a halfing ranger who used crossbows. He was born from generations worth of inbreeding, leaving him physically deformed to the point where he was just barely recognizable as a living being. Having came from a farming community, he had no education, and had so many mental problems that he couldn't even tell what was real and what was an imagination. He was eventually kicked out of the community because of everyone considering him an ill omen, thus forcing him to awkwardly hobble about the place in the hopes of surviving. Eddy himself was pretty smart guy, he had a talent for voices to, and the voice he chose for benny can only be described as gargling snot through a sponge. \n\nThe rest of the party were pretty standard for my group at the time, a lizardfolk barbarian, a human fighter and a rape born half drow sorcerer. The fighter and lizard knew each other, and the half drow was picked up from an enslavement camp and had stuck with them...Benny had followed them after the camp had been liberated, and none of them really wanted him around, but he just kept following regardless, like a stray hairless cat that vomited its own blood occasionally.\n\nIt was a simple war campaign, with the players as mercs earning their pay while trying to achive their goals. the lizard wanting to free his people from slavery, the human fighter was in it for land and a title, the drow was in it to kill the opposing empire because his father had been one of their soldiers \\(and they also made his once proud, if evil people, work in mines for the dwarves\\), but benny was just...there. like the team mascot, only they used him like bait, or a distraction, or an oddity for money.\n\nSomehow benny was able to stay alive long enough to get the luck feat, which meant that after that point, the party had to accept the fact they'd be stuck with the rolling meatball for a while longer. This was after the party had tried to use him as bait for a bugbear, thrown him over a wall to distract guards, made a bunch of lovecrafian cultists think they had summoned an eldrich being in humanoid form and set him on fire and sent him running at a massive spiders web. Aside for being a scapegoat for the others antics, Benny was mainly the consumable items guy, he carried things like ammo, health potions, exploding items like bombs and stuff for the group, using them by himself if need be. So while he wasn't really helpful most of the time, he was useful.\n\nAfter a few months, they found their way down into the underdark of that planet, which was basically a massive network of underground tunnels filled with all kinds of abominations. They were going to use them to get behind enemy lines, free the drow, let them back into the underdark, screw the enemy empires economy by ruining their mines and give their side another ally, if only for a while. While down there, they encountered the ruins of an old drow city which had been sacked long ago, populated by monsters mostly, but they eventually found an elder matriarch, one of the last free drow. While lawful evil, she was hospitable enough, especially after convincing her they were gonna free her people. In return for this, she offered to \"fix\" benny. Drow are skilled manipulators of the flesh, capable of creating brand new abominations with their foul magics, but  they could do many other things with it. The way she explained it was that benny could be restored to a \"normal\" state, which meant having flat 10's for all stats instead of 3.\n\nBut benny, the idiot savant that he was, rolled a nat 1 when making a small speech to the others, but used luck to get a nat 20.\" Yu gay's toook meh in wen no one else wood, yu ar meh famly, yu accep\\-assep\\-accepted meh ass ah em, I wanna stay liek dis, cos yu gays liek meh ass i am, an i wont chang meh elf jus cos am stupid, or ugly, or week.\" The drow matron understood him...barely, and retracted her offer if he was so against it. In other words, benny ruined his chance to be an ok character, and the other players were tempted to just toss him into the vat.\n\nThey got some cool drow swag instead though, and the drow matron made the half drow into a full blooded one at his request, so he was free of the filthy man taint. With that done, they left the ruins and went to the mines, did a bit of good RPing here and there before they started a slow escape, taking a small amount of drows out at a time before suddenly getting the rest out in one huge surge by busting the holding stockade. There was just one problem, the warden, a beefy fucking cave giant in full plate, alongside his lackeys. The fight went on longer than they wanted, as reinforcements were coming closer, so in an act of desperation, benny did the unthinkable. \n\nHe had been stocking bombs of all kinds inside his bag of holding, acid flasks, greek fire, granades, etc. He unloaded them all near the entrance to the tunnel section they were fighting in, grabbed a torch, and told the others to run for it. They all broke, taking attacks of opportunity on the way, but they all made it through, except benny. His final words were \"pazuzu, pazuzu, pazuzu!\". For reference, pazuzu is a demon lord, who possesses anyone who says his name three times in quick succession,. Benny dropped the torch at the same time, blowing up the cave entrance before having his soul eaten by the demon god, who went on a murder rampage against the reinforcements. \n\nBenny wasn't seen again after that, the chunky meatball of a man that he was, died that day. Had they returned they would have found him, still there with pazuzu inside his lumpy body, conjuring up a demonic portal. They never did find out how demons came into the campaign world, as they sealed that same mine later in the game, leaving it for future generations to handle, sparing them the fight against a punching bag and long lost friend.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/8hj1ph/pathfinder_unlimited_elemental_power/",
        "text": "This comes from one of my crazier players who tried to make a very specific class, he pitched it to me as a wizard/druid, who used only elemental spells and had some other stuff. It took a while, but we eventually managed to scrape something together. \n\nIt was called an elementalist, the idea being that it was a class that used both holy and arcane spells, but only those with \"elemental\" descriptors, or those that i deemed appropriate for the class. Things like chain lightning, darkness, acid arrow, etc. It also came with a beefier familiar, which was a combination of the animal companion and familiar, with it allowing the player to cast spells like burning hands through a bear. The downside was that it lacked the versatility of other spellcasting classes, but made up for it with AoE and battlefield manipulation. It made combat encounters a bitch to manage, because terrain was always shifting and I didn't have access to proper terrain models for it all to fit in the beginning. But, as this guy was a hardcore warhammer fantasy war mini's painter, he supplied me with what i needed after a bit.\n\n\\-\n\nThe character he made with this class was called Orson Keyes, a half elf raised by woodland kami \\(forest spirits\\)...who had a pet baboon, this baboons name was rajang, for reasons we'll get into later. Orson was one of those spacey nutcases who \"felt\" the world around him, to a point where he'd actually grope things...this is what happens when you have a wisdom of 3. But the guy looked stunning, with a cha of 20, you'd expect as much. So he had zero social awareness, but could sell sea water to a sailor. \n\nThere are alot of stories about Orson, but none were as creepy as the battle at eckon bridge. Long story short, the party were mainly nature based classes \\(a druid, an elementalist, a ranger and a bard\\), who were committing acts of eco\\-terrorism because they were trying to keep an elder god sealed away within this massive forest, while also trying to deal with these invading kingdoms from across the sea who had begun to build settlements on the coast. Eckon bridge was more of a huge root stem that linked the floating island that the elder god was on, to the land below. The most militaristic of the empires wanted to get up there, build a base and then cut the rope so they could fly around the world.\n\nThe battle at the bridge was more of a duel, with an entire army behind the general, his chosen champions, and a red dragon. Meanwhile, the players had amassed their own forces over the course of the campaign, consisting mainly of monsters, spirits and a few younger silver dragons. Whoever won, got to keep the island, and the armies were there to witness this event and ensure that no one tried anything. No one was expecting Orson though, not even Orson.\n\n\\-\n\nIt was a four on four duel, the four players against heroes from across the sea who were shipped in. It doesn't really matter what they were though, because in the span of one round, it went from a four on four duel, to a one on four duel. You see, Orson had gained access to an ability called channeling of the elements. It meant that he could cast one elemental spell as normal, then cast another one of the same type, provided that he burned two spell slots for the second one, and then again by burning three spell slots, and so on. The math is a little complicated and hard to explain, but basically, he cast chain lightning, then burned two spell slots of the same level to cast it again, and then two of the higher tier of spells and the last spell of the prior level to cast it again. The biggest downside was that all of these could be countered with a single counterspell, which only needed to counter the first spell cast.\n\nThis was boosted by lightning being one of his favoured elements \\(he got to pick one favoured element out of 12 every 4 levels\\). Combine that with a ring of arcane overload \\(a magical item i homebrewed which allows you to treat a spell as if it were effected by the metamagic maximise feat, works once before breaking\\), and the end result was devestating.\n\nTL;DR he cast chain lightning 4 times in a single round. which was made stronger by his gear.\n\nwe all paused while he rolled every last D6 we had at the table, the grand total was enough to kill pretty much any monster you name. So of course i had to describe it as palpatine as possible. \n\n\\-\n\nAs he beheld his enemies, those who wished to defile his land and defy the laws of nature, anger surged through him, rising up from the earth and striking down into him from the clouds above. energy crackled like novas at his fingertips, leaping from one to the next, energy ripping through his limbs, collecting in the palms of his hands, stray streaks scorching the ground about his feet, licking at the air, desperate for release. The four warriors before him watched in awe and horror, the very air tasting of ozone and copper. In one swift jerking motion, hands thrusting forward, the wrath of gaia was set free, blanketing the surrounding area in a bouquet of screeching thin banshees, their nails raking all in their path, the blinding light consuming all. Unlimited power struck the enemies before him, reducing them to ash and cinder, but just as soon as ultimate fury had been tasted, it was gone. The ground was charred earth, the air was a haze of mist and ash, his hands red raw from the discharge, but all were slain, except one.\n\nThis last remaining hero was actually a graveknight that had immunity to lightning damage. While he wouldn't have been a problem, as the other players had their turns...next up was rajang, a now medium sized baboon. His turn was simple, get to the graveknight, then touch him. Orson had the ability to cast spells on rajangs turn, but only one. But as he was an elementalist, he had worked with me to make some homebrew spells that had elemental effects, for higher levels. One of them was Ignus's embrace. A spell which worked like burning hands, only much stronger, and had follow up damage, dealing half the amount of the original damage for every round the spellcaster \\(or familiar\\) is grappled to them. The graveknight suffered about 90 fire damage in a single round, after having tanked 4 chain lightning spells in a single go, he was being humped by a baboon at the same time. \n\nThe other players just disabled the graveknight and let the flaming baboon hug kill him. which settled the contest fair and square, to the horror of the enemy army...and even their allies, because no one had expected Orson to pull that off. Afterwards he gave himself the title of sith, no one questioned him after that.\n\n\\-\\-\n\nThe moral of the story? Balance your homebrew classes and expect your players to abuse broken mechanics. The elementalist class was balanced for the most part...for multiple encounters. For a single encounter after resting? Nothing stood a chance, which is why we don't use it anymore.",

        "text": "This is the story of currently three students attending a highschool in Neo Toronto called Bravo Academy, a specially designed facility to help superpowered Novahuman teens control their powers as well as get a good education.\n\n[Previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/8alqnd/mutants_and_masterminds_3e_bravo_academy_part_5/), students Alistair, Kayla and Sean were attending a practical field class under the direction of Wildman to investigate a mock crimescene where they run afoul of supervillain Max Predator. After Wildman and Max have a brief scuffle, Max leaves and the group head back to the school to continue their day. Kayla and Alistair attend a video games club while Sean heads back into the city and gets himself a job delivering pizzas. That night, the group are interrupted when Max Predator, having somehow bypassed the school security and tracked them down, initiates another fight. While Kayla fixes the security system, Sean, Alistair and Rachel face off against Max before he’s subdued by Golden Conquerer and a swarm of Dudebots.\n\nPlayers were awarded one Power Point for their efforts, and at the start of the fourth session, their Hero Points reset to 1 each.\n\n*Thus, we move onto our next adventure:*\n\nPlay begins the following morning. The trio awaken after a sleepless night in the infirmary, and are informed that their dorm is almost patched up and ready for use. Alistair’s player was unable to attend this session, so contextually, he heads back to the dorm to spend some time resting and thinking and what-not.\n\nKayla also returns home and tends to Lucky while Sean clears his head by wandering the school. He meets with Jose, Freddy and Andrew in the cafeteria briefly, who all express concern over what happened. As they talk, an announcement is sounded that the three of them are to head to the principal’s office as soon as possible.\n\nOnly Kayla and Sean arrive, Alistair currently relaxing as much as possible after the ordeal and being subject to Rachel’s power. Going into the administration office, the two are wordlessly pointed in the direction of the principal’s office, following a long series of narrow corridors before finally approaching a tall, oak door with the words “Dr. Arthur Langford School Principal” perfectly placed on the door in gold lettering.\n\nKnocking, the two are invited in and find themselves in a nice office, with a dark green and red colour palette. Only the consistent tick of the mechanical clock on the wall can be heard from within. Near the door stands Golden Conquerer, arms folded and in full costume. Behind the large, oak desk is a tall, slender man dressed in suit and tie, which most notably stands out due to the fact his head was that of a black-scaled snake. The Snekman, presumably Dr. Langford, is writing something down. Eventually he looks up and acknowledges the lack of Alistair. When the pair explains this absence, the principal lets them sit down.\n\nHe introduces himself in a fairly friendly manner, apologising for not being at previous events and being relatively unknown to the students. He then breaches the core of why the players were called into the office. He notes that it’s the first time a villain had set foot on academy grounds that wasn’t reformed and an employee, but that didn’t mean the players were at fault, of course.\n\nLangford notes that Max Predator was an obsessive psychopath, truly marred by the lack of ‘respect’ the world had given him past his heyday during the Iron Age of super heroics; he craved recognition and not getting it was a particularly sore spot (noting that he ‘tore through a couple of inmates last time he was in jail for not recognising him’). It didn’t help that he was somehow fairly forgettable, and it was likely that students of this generation would fall into such a trap if they encountered each other.\n\nHe then moves on to Grav Master, noting Halo had the group receive the key cards necessary for the group to train with them, as well as the Iron Bandit, who wandered onto a training course without staff knowledge. He then puts down the pen and clasps his hands together as he slooowly leans forward on his desk. It’s hard to read the expression on his face because snek.\n\n“Three ssssupervillainsss, all to do with the ressidentssss of room ssseven-oh-nine,” he begins, pausing slightly, “that isss both impressssive, but also conccccerning.”\n\nHe says that based on what they know, none of this was done intentionally by any of the three students, but they had to understand that it would have an impact on the school. They didn’t want to expel the group, or even suspend them. All Langford wanted to do was ask the trio some questions to see if they can figure out why; after all, it wasn’t exactly common for people their age to have not one but three arch enemies, to which Sean says that really their only Arch-Nemesis was likely Dr. Irresponsible.\n\nLangford dwelt on that unfortunate bit of nostalgia, saying Irresponsible was the only student they ever expelled from the school, mainly because he was so set on supervillainy.\n\nHe goes on to ask a single question, mainly if the two know of anyone from their lives that would want them scared, hurt or dead. Sean brings up his connection to the military, that his brother and the military officers in charge of Novahuman enlistment would be the only ones he could think of, but they wouldn’t want him dead or hurt, just enlisted. Kayla, meanwhile, brings up her elder sister, a fairly superficial person who was never a fan of the young novahuman. She brings up that her sister was planning on becoming a model, and didn’t like that Kayla got special attention because of those very super powers.\n\nWhile neither source would suggest anyone or anything truly malevolent, Langford makes a note of both. The two mention Alistair’s dad being a superhero while he was alive, possibly being a core lead in this.\n\nAfter the questions are answered, Langford mentions to the two that the school’s ‘Powers Display’ event is coming up, basically being a sporting event where students are able to show off what they have and over successive years, how far they’ve come. This comes up a little bit before the Homecoming dance and other events associated with it, where new students are encouraged to make their own costumes and pick their code names for the dance if, despite the school’s stance on super heroics, they still want to become superheroes. This excites the two of them to no end.\n\nThe Powers Display was designed to be big and flashy and broadcast out on local television and secure livestreams to parents of international students, and would hopefully serve as a reminder why attacking an island of hormonally imbalanced super-powered teens and their veteran handlers is a fucking bad idea.\n\nLangford also mentions that major superheroes or influential Novahumans would be in attendance for the event, of course, and this year the headliners would be three members of the Justiciars: Steel King, Legend and Voltaic Vanguard. The three of them would be spending some extra time getting information from the group before doing their typical PR, watching the event and going on their way.\n\nThe villains were a troubling factor. No one could dispute this many bad guys in this short a time period was purely coincidence and the disabling of the security system to let Max Predator onto the island was the clincher: this was likely a co-ordinated attack, but who the one behind it was and the overall goal of the attack was unknown. The International Novahuman Police may wish to ask some questions, no doubt, and Halo has a lot of paperwork to fill out.\n\nAs the conversation goes on, Langford asks if the two had eaten today, and when they say no, Langford asks Golden Conqueror to get Pizza, but Sean offers to go instead. In the matter of an instant, the four enjoy a meal, though GC seems fairly stand-offish with the two, clearly lacking Langford’s empathy.\n\nAfter food is had and pleasantries exchanged, the group are let out of the room at about 1 pm and both of the students make their way over to the danger room to talk to Smythe. When getting there, Kayla asks to head in to practice her tasing ability, while Sean discusses the use of the danger room to set up a simulation of a search and rescue mission, and Smythe is more than willing to comply. While they talk, Dr. Smythe mentions that he has a [friend, of sorts]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOKBitOl76M) or rather several different versions of that friend who is more familiar with the workings of Supervillain Society. When asked what he meant by ‘versions’, Smythe is all too quick to point out the magnum opus of his inventions, being the brass gauntlet he wears on his right arm that lets him hop dimensions, though he’s unable to take anyone with him. Smythe himself isn’t native to this dimension; he just enjoys moving around places and this one happens to be one of his favourites.\n\nAfter some practice and tutorials on how to make new scenes in the danger room, another person enters the facility, this time being Jonathan, who greets the two with a smile and turns to regard Smythe. He asks Smythe if he knew anything specific about the tunnels below the school used for the Base Building club, and Smythe says he doesn’t beyond what the group already know. Jonathan then asks if he had permission to head down, as he heard strange noises coming from the first access port and wanted to investigate, and Smythe says he’s able to and didn’t need to ask permission.\n\nSean offers to lend a hand, as does Kayla when she finishes with the robot zapping, and Jonathan says that he’ll meet them at the access tunnel after picking up something from the vault. When the three regroup, Sean having gotten changed into gym clothes, Jonathan arrives carrying a staff, adorned with trinkets and talismans. When asked, Jonathan says it is indeed magic, an item he calls the Staff of the Wanderer, which he constructed over several years.\n\nThe three enter the basement, a long series of clinical corridors with automatic lights and basic structure for the sake of safety. As they explore, the group encounter odd spots of heat, presumably from fire, that hadn’t set off the sprinklers or the alarms. Sean zips back and grabs a fire extinguisher before they advance towards one of the heat sources.\n\nA large, stone construct, ablaze with intense flame turns to regard the group and advances regardless of warnings. Sean uses his fire extinguisher to douse the flames revealing stone beneath, Kayla manages to slide the thing against a wall using her magnetic abilities and Jonathan casts a spell to morph the wall into a grasping hand, keeping the thing in place.\n\nThe three deconstruct the golem, finding its structure is more that of clay with a metal frame on the inside. Kayla takes one of the poles to channel her static shock, and the group deduce through Jonathan’s magic expertise and Kayla’s googling that it’s a golem, given basic commands and those were defensive ones.\nThe three proceed to find the other one and instead of immediately attacking, the three decide to follow it and see if it leads them to a master. Kayla and Jonathan stay behind, using the security cameras and scrying spells to follow it, while Sean uses his speed advantage to duck into rooms and remain unseen (even having time to find Gar’s base and write ‘Redline Wuz Here’ somewhere.)\n\nThe golem leads the three to a room, inside of which a scrawny, grubby looking student working on another one of these golems. Sean takes out his phone, uses it to snap a picture of the teen, speedily sabotage the golem before fleeing, the one available golem in hot pursuit (huehuehue).\n\nReturning to the party, Sean shows the picture to the others, with Kayla looking over the database finding the student being a Paul Davidson, an amateur mage, whose record states that he was a perfectly normal student until yesterday. Both Kayla and Jonathan note that Paul seems to be afraid of something that isn’t Sean, and the three hatch a plan to be diplomatic. While Jonathan takes care of the last golem, Sean and Kayla rush over to confront and comfort the poor kid, who then crumbles before the two and mumbles to himself about something, namely “when the sky turns to metal, all will be taken.”\n\nThe two discuss the troubling nature of this before Sean takes Paul to the nurse’s office and Kayla goes to meet up with Jonathan just as he is using a spell to banish the last golem.\n\n[We’ll just have to wait and see what happens next.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/8nmcyq/mutants_and_masterminds_3e_bravo_academy_part_7/)",

        "text": "This was from a one shot game that me and three friends did while one of the group members was off on private affairs. It was supposed to be a simple heist job, but as per usual with these types of things i gave every player a secondary objective to complete, either without the others knowing, or to convince them to help in it, or whatever worked best. So, we had a warforged rogue, a warforged rogue...and a warforged rogue. So three warforged rogues, each one specializing in one of three things. One was the talker, one was the killer, and the last was the sneaker.\n\nThey had to break into an island facility just off the coast, but there was a landbridge connecting it to the mainland. Once there they'd need to steal the content of a safe, ideally picking up the plans for a new refinery in the process, then escape. The talker's goal was to Kidnap a gnome engineer, storing him in his chest compartment. The killers goal was to kill said gnome engineer. The sneakers goal was to give the gnome engineer a message and make sure that they could pass it on.\n\nThe players had been given a basic map of the place along with some details about the facility prior to the beginning of the session so they had a bit of time to prep, which they finished when we all arrived for the day. They agreed to escape by jumping into the sea and walk back to land, but they wanted to use the land bridge to enter, as there were too many obstacles to make climbing up out of the water seem safe. Two of the three got into a box, disassembling themselves so the crate could be smaller while the third, who was a really hot bit of metal \\(literally, they were enchanted with a fire spell\\) pushed it along. A few disguise checks got them past customs, but one guard stopped them, and we had the talker roll a few times for different skills to convince the guard. Lots of poor rolls later and he had to resort to seduction...fucking nat 20. He took the guard into the guard house after convincing her that this warforged was 'fully equipped'. Only to snap her neck when she 'made herself prone' and stuffed her into a locker.\n\nThey carried on, and in a quiet corner of the warehouse they pieced the other two members together before heading off again. There were other warforged working in the place, so they blended in well enough, but the problem was that they were only allowed in restricted areas. The killer tried to befriend some of the gruff catagory large warforged with a few rounds of arm wrestling, but after that came to a stalemate, they shifted to augmentation showing off. Naturally the bigger ones flexed their inbuilt maces...and the killer showed off the fact his entire arm was a fully functioning shotgun, loaded with magical bullets. While this was going on, the other two were trying to find a way out of the warehouse section and get into the main compound. The walls were made of wood, and after some careful burning and cutting, they made a small hole at the back. But instead of sneaking, the killer bot decided to start a riot.\n\nThe Warforged could not take off these collars they wore, nor could any warforged who already had them on, but the killer bot could, ripping them off one by one before leaving the workers to do their own thing while the party snuck out. It took less than ten minutes for utter chaos to break out in the main courtyard, letting the party sneak around back to the central lighthouse tower which had been converted into a multi\\-tiered workshop.\n\nThe place was big, 30 feet radius circular tower that was only 20 feet radius at it's narrowest point at the top. Getting to it wasn't easy, as the players had to disassemble themselves again, chuck their bodies over a huge gap, reassemble themselves, then repeat. Took them half an hour to reach a high up window on the tower with a balcony. Killing the guard there by shanking him through the face with a flaming bladed finger. But the door was locked...and they had already tossed the guards body off the edge and into the sea below. So the sneaker thrust his lockpick into it and messed with the lock, literally fucking the keyhole to open it. By then the riot had died down, most of the warforged down there were dead and the place was in full alert mode.\n\nThey quickly split up, one went down a few levels to destroy the stair well so no one could get up, one went up to the top to see if he could find some sort of glider or anything useful for escape, and the last one went to find the vault. The gnome engineer was hiding under a desk near the vault, which was close to the top, so the talker and the sneaker had a chance to find him...but the talker failed his check to see if he spotted him, while the sneaker found him right away and waited for the other guy to leave. He opened the safe, gave the gnome the message, then shoved him into the safe just as the killer came up the stairs.\n\nThe other two tried to think where the gnome went, the killer assuming he must have fled during the riot, while the talker thought he was just hiding somewhere as he wasn't really allowed out of the facility. They gingerly pieced information that each of them knew together, trying to mask the source of their info. They realized that the gnome was a against the current regime, that he was also a highly sought after inventor, and that he was very important for the regime as he was able to make their weapons of war. But as they had no idea where he was, they sent the sneaker ahead, giving him a glider and letting him fly off first, but the other two stayed behind to hunt for the gnome, neither of them guessing that he was tucked inside the safe since they failed their sense motive rolls against the sneaker.\n\nAfter a few combat encounters, they decided to just collapse the entire tower, using the remaining gunpowder from the enemies they fought, and the chemicals from the labs on each floor...but with the tower being screwed after a certain level, they couldn't even pull this off. It was about then that the talker realized the tower was on fire, because the killer had set everything ablaze anyway.\n\nThey both left, met with the sneaker on the bottom of the sea, and waded their way back to shore. I recapped the end of the game after making several roles, which determined that the gnome had in fact survived, was able to use the information given to him in order to escape and join the rebellion, and helped bring down the machines of war he had helped make. The talkers faction was pissed with him because now they didn't have access to that tech, and the killers faction dismantled and reprogrammed him after failing.\n\nThis is a kind of one shot i do regularly, and this was the smoothest it ever went...despite the three warforged doing some really whacky stuff.",

        "text": "I'm running Tomb of Annihilation, and am using the free guide for jungle encounters. One of them was that the players happen upon an old ruin with a maze rune that unlocks a hidden chamber. I decided to jazz it up a little.\n\nSo I drew up this layout: http://imgur.com/IHnRhA2 \n\nPlayers came upon a rectangular ruin with ancient reliefs depicting partygoers and revellers in some sort of celebration. A divine sense detected some sort of unseen consecrated space below. They searched for entrances and found nothing, and upon digging, found that there was some large stone base under the tiling and dirt.\n\nThey head onward to a heavily consecrated circular ruin with reliefs of well dressed people all staring inward towards the center. The whole space looks out across a jungle, and in  the center stands a stone pedestal with a maze-like relief set into the center: https://goo.gl/images/t2XcQ9 \n\nWords etched into the floor around the pedestal, in old omuan, read:\nthough time turns day by day\nand we often seem to lose our way\nwe always manage to find another\nhand in hand we come together\n\nThe two burliest, biggest bro fighters step up and begin to trace the map with their fingers, starting from opposite sides. The letters light up at their feet, and as their fingers meet at the center, the whole pedestal flashes bright radiant light, and fades. They hear the sounds of grinding stone and head back to the main hall to find an entrance to an underground chamber has opened.\n\nThe chamber below consisted of an ancient straw bed, with  reliefs and paintings of tantric, intimate acts all over the walls, and a small vial... Perfume of Bewitching.\n\nAt this point the two players turn to me... \"Wait, did we just get married?\"\n\n...Then the zombie horde descends.\n\nBig hit in the middle of the jungle slog, would recommend.",

The gang needs me, and I'm going to help them save the world, yeah I'm gonna be one of those big hero's in those stories I'd always read to you. Just like in those stories the Hero will see his family again, just like I will see you again one day. For now though big bro's gotta go, just know I love you alright and that I am in a great place with lots and lots of chocolate alright? I love you Alexa.\n\n-Nolan\n\nFollowed by a letter to the mom with the contact information of the noble girl he was seeing to set them up financially for life.\n\nAfterwards we took him home, and buried him next to his dad on his families farm. His gravestone said:\n\nHere Lies Nolan, a good man.\n\nThat is the tale of Nolan, the greatest Roleplayer I have ever met.",

The town they lived in was starting to look habitable after they used the money from sold artifacts to restore parts of it, and the road into town was much safer after they killed off a section of the crazy peoples cult for crazy people. With the hamlet they lived in finally beginning to get some traffic, it soon became clear that they'd need to gain access to a port of some kind if they wanted to get their hands on real gear. There was just one problem, they had only one real port, and that was the lagoon harbor, which could only be accessed via the cove caves.\n\nThe cove was one of two areas they hadn't visited at that point, the other being the manor itself, which was basically suicide. I think they just found water pretty spooky, especially when they know that cthulhu babies are swimming underneath the surface. So in order to avoid having to deal with under water combat and other fishy fiends, they hatched a plan. They got lord dunstein, the head of this whole affair, to order as much gunpowder as he could possibly fit into a single ship, then have it sail up the coast to the cove, with strict instructions to dock in the lagoon. The party took a trip to get onto that ship, so they could defend it as the boat made its way over the coastal seas. \n\nThey knew this was going to happen sooner or later though, they knew they'd have to fight water monsters, and they really struggled. It was only three encounters over the course of two sessions, but as none of them had any ranged weaponry, save for spells, it took ages for them to finish off groups of fishmen. They did learn how dangerous nets were, a lesson they took to heart. As they were closing in on the lagoon, the party used very specific wording to describe what they did. \"I take some pitch, gunpowder and wood, making a quick little device that will explode after thirty minutes and set it in the middle of one of the gunpowder barrels, leaving it standing upright so it doesn't set anything off too early.\" I  would have had the plan fail and the boat blow up early if they hadn't rolled a nat twenty on the trapwork check. They got off the boat, onto a raft, and sailed to shore before running ahead to get a good view of the fireworks.\n\nThe main boss of the cove was going to be a beefed up colossal squid, think kraken, but much weaker, and smarter. The party watched as the squizard attacked the boat, killing the seamen aboard it with ease before slowly dragging the boat down into the depths...before exploding like a gore fountain. But they didn't take into account just how big the explosion was actually going to be, blowing up not only the tentacled queen of the seas, but the docks, and a chunk of the cove...and part of the lagoon's entrance, causing a landslide which made it inaccessible. \n\nThey tried to take a positive spin on things, like how it wasn't raining anywhere near as much, but in the end they had ensured underwater combat because lord dunstein ordered them to go clear out the landslide. They had access to some wands of stoneshaping, which made their job a little easier, but they had called down the wrath of the eldrich gods with that little trick. I didn't want to kill them, but as they walked along the edge of the lagoon to the entrance, all they saw in the water was hundreds of eyes, all staring up at them in undiluted fury, several mermaids even tried to use their voices on them, to lure them in and die upon the rocks. It was clear they had one of two options, try to clear the lagoon and gain access to shipped in goods, but be forced to kill off a massive horde of sea monsters. Or they could not bother and make do with what they had. They went for the latter...but they were still going to need to pay a price.\n\nA few more sessions pass of normal missions, until the first town raid hit. Normally in the game, it's bandits lead by a crazy guy with a beard, I had intended to have more than just bandits attack now and then to make sure they never really felt safe, but only after they hit level ten. They were level seven when the fishmen attacked. \n\nThe way each area worked in my game was each one had some factions in it who usually kept apart from each other. Like the waeld, where you had the hags, the arachnids, the fungi and the wildlife. The cove was similar, but now they all had a uniting goal, to destroy those who busted their home. Frog and lizard men made up the bulk of the fighting force since they could fight on land easily, while the fish men took on spellcaster roles. The effect was utter havoc, the palisade did nothing to stop the oncoming onslaught. Even with the beefed up town NPC's, it was still about thirty people to 100. \n\nIt really did come down to the wire on who would win. The players were able to drop one enemy every round at minimum, but there were always more to take the place of their fallen ally. The rogue died after getting isolated, impaled nine ways to Sunday on tridents before having his corpse tossed into a fire. Death was something that hit much harder in this campaign, since i had homeruled no resurrection spells except for those of the highest level. Several other NPC's dropped and half the horde was killed off before the 'final boss' of the raid.\n\nearlier on in the campaign, they had learned that this was not the first expedition into these lands, other heroes had came here before them and died. Some were heroes from folk tales, others were nameless vagabonds who's skill went unnoticed, The first of these heroes back from the grave they had met was robin hood. An undead ranger who stalked the waeld. The hero of the cove was blackbeard, a dullahan with levels in gunslinger. The fishmen made a half circle, letting him and some of his undead crew have a crack at the rest of the party, which was restored back to four after the rogue player produced one of his spare character sheets. This time we had a Ranger who specialized in firearms and explosives, very fitting.\n\nThey split off into smaller fights, with the fighter handling two of the crew while the ranger and warlock focused fire on blackbeard. shattered bones went everywhere, crushed by hefty mace and blasted by hard shot. everyone was suffering, already caked in gore, it was impossible to tell how much of the blood was their own and what had came from the creatures they killed before. Blackbeard kept dropping the warlock, with the cleric throwing healing spells to keep everyone from slipping into the eternal rest that death promised. But it all came to a head when the ranger used a granade.\n\nHe had given up his spellcasting abilities in favour of some alchemist abilities, one of which was allowing him to craft explosive vials. It worked like a fireball, but instead of hitting blackbeard, he hit the pub, bringing the whole thing crashing down onto the undead captain, his crew, lots of fishmen and the fighter...that fighter, i swear, he survived with one hit point after barely making a reflex save. Everything else was dead as a doorknob.\n\nThe remaining fishmen fled back to the lagoon, but they didn't leave entirely. After the town was cleared up the party had gone to see what was going on down there, the fishmen were trying to rebuild their homes, even added some huts onto the beach. In the end, they had killed masses of fishmen, the squizard, blackbeard and gotten rid of most of the cove area, but at the cost of masses of gold, several close friends, part of their town and a shipping rout. Overall, they deemed it a success.",

        "text": "&gt;After their unfortunate encounter with the rats, Rickart and Alice need to let the unconscious Nez rest and recover. Rickart scopes out the end of the old sewer tunnel, finding a barred grate secured with a padlock. Through the grate, he spies 60 feet of open ground separating him from a line of trees and shrubs - according to his intelligence, covering the river leading to the main objective. He returns to his colleagues, to rest.\n\nA particularly poor hit dice roll got Nez up to 3 HP. Not the best.\n\n&gt;Once up and about, the party addresses the door. It is large, solid, and a mass of rust.  Rickart oils the hinges and the lock and uses the key given him by the Governor of Greenest. The key snaps in two.\n\nBaaaad roll.  OK, no problem - I'm a rogue!\n\n&gt; He heaves a sigh, takes out his lock picks and tackles the lock.  After some effort, he admits the lock will not budge. The team decides to force the door, and eliminate any witnesses to keep the secret of the tunnel. The three adventurers gird their loins, put their shoulders to it, and pop the door open with a crash. \n\n&gt; Stepping out into the night, all is quiet.  They agree that they need to make a dash for the tree-line to get some cover, and plan their next move. They make a run across the open ground, expecting challenge but finding none.  Rickart lags behind Nez and Alice (small legs) but all three break through the tree-line to find...trouble.\n\n&gt; They burst through the bushes to find 5 kobolds and 4 cultists creeping through the scrub, shocked at the intrusion. Heavily outnumbered, the team has no choice but to fight.\n\nIt is at this point that we expect the TPK. We spent ages planning to keep Nez out of meelee combat - just where he ends up. I am lagging behind, so no sneak attack bonus for me. Alice can tank, but not 9 hostiles.  It's bad.\n\n&gt; Alice doesn't hesitate.  She whips out her sword, but in her haste to attack (and our blanket shock) she drops it. The cultists advance, and one of the kobolds fires a pellet from a slingshot... taking out one of his colleagues.\n\nAlice rolls decent initiative, but rolls a crit fail on her first attack.  Our DM is old-school - nat 1 punishes. Of course, that works for the kobolds as well. One down, eight to go!\n\n&gt; Nez attempts to blast enemies, but cannot get a bead on them. Rickart charges Nez's foe and scrambles his innards with his rapier, desperate to try and prevent the vulnerable Nez from dropping again.\n\n&gt; Alice, lacking her sword, unleashes her whip and gets a stranglehold on a cultist.  He puts up a fight, but cannot get loose.  After mortally wounding him, she manhandles him to the ground and stomps on his head, putting his light out. Nez is overwhelmed, and falls to the horde. Things are already looking bleak as another figure in cultist's robes arrives. Then the new figure unleashes a furious flurry of blows on a kobold, dropping him.  \n\nOH MY GOD ITS COUTH! He donned a disguise and tracked the cultists to this location.  This could have felt like the DM taking pity on us, but it totally worked in context.\n\n&gt; The party fights valiantly, Rickart dropping his sword to shoot a fleeing cultist before he can get away and reveal the secret tunnel location. But Alice is also put down just before the party clears out the cultists and kobolds. Rickart and Couth create some cover and take a short rest, allowing Nez and Alice to heal. \n\n&gt; Couth informs the party that his debt is now repaid, but he will be scouting around using the new safe passage the party was able to secure. The party decides to disguise themselves as cultists to ease thier approach to the church (the next goal). Rickart decides to rely on his stealth and small size, but Alice uses her disguise kit to make herself more human in appearance while Nez casts Disguise Self to transform into a very plain-looking man (all humans look a little alike to him). They don robes pulled from the fallen enemies, and gird themselves for an assault on the church.",

        "text": "Aaalrighty then, this is the second part of the extended one shot we played as a bunch of Memepriests of Mars.\n\nAfter we snatched ourselves an inquisitor who knew where a STC is located as that was our one and only chance to become real somebodies and have something named after us (the Siri-Mikahil-Tesla McGuffin) we found ourselves on the machinedeck of an ecclesiarchical cruiser under the command of the Ordo Famulus. After a minor diplomatic hiccup in which a low-ranking Sororitas named Pretifass Whatshername insulted the work of the Omnissiah by not appreciating our generous offer of cybernetic enhancement, we finally were introduced to the vessels techpriests.\n\nOr, I should say, techpriest. As in singular. With a horde of ecclesiarchical serfs, so called 'engine-ears' as his main workforce. This latter fact was also the bump in the road that sort of threw off Siri in her meticulously prepared berating of the techpriest as laying the wonders and secrets of the machinegod bare before the eyes of the uninitiated was a whole new level of tech heresy, one that also Mika and Tesla were - as the guardsmen say - 'not cool with'. Thus, what began as Siri verbally murdering the techpriest with Tesla and Mike shrugging and murmuring an occasional \"It's not an AdMech ship, what did you expect?\" soon turned into a Mechanicum congress level of accusations and threats.\n\nIt escalated slightly the moment the heretical techpriest loudly exclaimed that, no, we are not turning his crew of engine-ears into servitors and in his incompetence failed to use the proper Cant Mechanicum and instead used low gothic. This upset the crew, that had gathered to witness their superiors verbal execution, greatly as they - unsurprisingly - failed to see the benefits of living out their days as children of the Omnissiah.\n\nSo, while Siri continued to go over every tech heresy she had witnessed during our two hour tour, explaining in great detail what was done wrong, how it factored into the techpriest being a heretical idiot (a heretiot, as Mike threw in), how it should have been done correctly as well as where the heretiot could find these instructions in the Omnissiahs holy scriptures, should he ever get around to upgrading his intellectual facilities enough to master the skill of reading, Tesla was busy keeping the rabble on arms length with threats of lethal Lumina discharges while Mike continued explaining to the crew why they needed to be servitorized, what the process included and what equipment he needed them to get from storage. They were coming around when the heretiot utterly lost it, accusing us of personifying 'everything wrong with the Mechanicum' and even going so far as saying that our 'moronic, regressive views' were the reason the Imperium of Man were stuck in an eon of stagnation'. He then concluded his temper tantrum with the preposterous suggestion that we had 'our heads so far up our own asses, we could not even smell our own shit anymore'.\n\nMike thus stopped preaching the benefits of servitor-life to the rabble (in binary, he didn't speak low gothic by the way) and explained to the heretiot that such was not anatomically possible and, by the way, we lived in M41 and nobody used anuses anymore anyway. He then opened his robe and explained that waste export tubes were now the new Mechanicum standard and by far more efficient. Siri complimented him on having a very finely crafted one.\n\nAt this point, GM got up and called a break. He was going to order pizza and get more beer, as he was not yet drunk enough for insane techpriests complementing each others assholes.\n\nSo, an hour and several bottles of beer later, we got back at it. Mikes explanation had actually ended the heretiots rant as he was now officially shell shocked by our expert conflict solution skills. He, however, had not yet come to the conclusion that we were right and he was an idiot, so instead of doing the sensible thing and becoming our servant, he told his engine-ears to 'lock them in storage room four and get the inquisitor. And the shipmaster. And maybe a firing squad'. While we did not agree on the locking up part and thought that shooting himself and his heretical workforce would be a bit wasteful. We did however agree that the matter of the unacceptable treatment of the holy machines and the unsanctioned disclosure of Mechanicum secrets to the uninitiated were definitely crimes worthy of an inquisitors attention and that, considering he was responsible for the vessels wellbeing, the shipmaster should be servitorized as well.\n\nHowever, for the moment we were being held in a rather small storage unit with little usable equipment. This, however, did not deter us as idle hands are heresy and so, twenty minutes of divine inspiration later, we were moving through the air ducts towards a more suitable room - a currently unused workshop on one of the black decks. We dispatched a few mutants who had made the place their home and looked upon the room with satisfaction: This was exactly what we needed for operation house-cleaning.\n\nGM: Wait, what? What is Operation house-cleaning?!\n\nYou see, idle hands are heresy and we were no heretics. The other guys were heretics (and one was a heretiot). So, we had decided, we would not waste out month long journey to Bennards Hope by sitting on our backside stabilization units! No sir, we were going to whip this vessel into form, give the machine spirit the treatment it deserved and make sure that, once we leave, not a single tech-heresy remained!\n\n&gt;**Step I: Get servitors or make people die trying**\n\nThis first step was the most obvious, really. While idle hands were undoubtedly heresy, we would surely not make ours dirty. Each of us held the rank of Magos after all. Thus, expendable, drone-like hands were needed. Thankfully we were on a vessel with around 50.000 menials as well as a fair number of servitors, so either we would gain control over the existing servitor populous or we'd just make new ones. (GM capitulated at this point)\n\nSo, we went on to do some exploring. It turned out that the deck we had chosen to occupy was actually one the crew had begun to push into themselves. There was a small mishap of a few crewmen mistaking us for mutants in the dark, but between Teslas all around don't-fuck-with-me-ness (seriously, the guy was as buff as a Skitarii) and Siri and Mikes laspistol skills, they were quickly dispatched and returned to our workshop for servitorization. Mike went on and gathered some actual servitors off which he promptly ripped off all ecclesiarchical nonsense and used his pen to write proper psalms in binary over the flawed texts (sure, this was mostly to avoid being chewed out by Siri, but he also was starting to agree with her on proper procedures).\n\nAt this point, inquisitor Elana hailed us, her voice sounding stangely stressed, and, with a clearly forced calmness, asked us where we were. We admired her professionalism - many meatbags would get jittery when dealing with heresy of the level that was going on here - and informed her that all was good and we were taking care of the issues at hand. We recommended she put the shipmaster, the heretiot and his illegal and highly heretical workforce in stasis, so that we could convert them into servitors later. She sounded despaired - obviously wanting to kill the traitors herself - and acknowledged our instructions with a 'Yes, yes, whatever! WHERE ARE YOU?!'. Such an amount of cooperation was quite refreshing, so we asked the inquisitor to compile a list of non essential crew members to bolster the servitor workforce if she wanted to help more, thanked her for her assistance and assured her that she need not worry about us - everything will be handled - and cut the vox. After all, it was one of the one the vessels subsystems which really didn't need any power at the moment and we needed it for operation house-cleaning...\n\n&gt;**Step II: Basebuilding 101 with Mr Militant**\n\nNow, there are a few things one needs to know about Tesla. The man had served in an Explorator Fleet for more than a century and had seen quite a lot of war in the time. Where Siri and Mike were geared more towards intellectual problem solving, Tesla was armored in heavy plate and carried a hidden arsenal of divinely inspired weaponry. He was one of the guys who marched next to the Skitarii when a piece of technology needed liberation from xenos or traitors aftersll.\n\nWith that in mind it came as no surprise when he declared our current workplace unsafe and our servitors unfit for security detail. We argued against it, considering that we were on a friendly (albeit stupid) ship. Tesla then pointed out we had already faced cannibalistic mutants when we had secured the workshop and it would be an unforgivable lapse in judgement if we just took the risk of our work being undone by semi-sentient subhumans. \n\nSo, while Siri and Mike went to work on servitorizing the fresh corpses we had in store, Tesla began fortifying our deck and equipping the existing servitors with improvised weapons to fend of mutants - blowtorches became flamethrowers, nailguns were upgraded to full-auto, that kind of stuff. There were some minor incidents when another group of engine-ears ran into Teslas sentries and were shredded, but seeing as we wanted them servitorized anyway, we just added them to the production line. By now, servitors were doing 80% of the work in our workshop and Siri just had to so there and program the new servitors. Mike wondered why the heretical workforce was not put on ice as inquisitor Elena had promised and attributed this to the general incompetence of the unaugmented. He sent her a setvitor with a friendly note, informing her that 'some got away, pay more attention when doing your job or I will report you for incompetence!'. He did not specify to whom.\n\nWe had a phase of relative peace and productivity while GM figured out how to get his oneshot back on the rails. We thus had time to roleplay and fortify, which we did. We had GM draw us a map of the deck we were appropriating and Mike went on a tour to check out the other rooms and maybe find something useful for what was slowly turning into a improv manufactorum while Tesla beefed up the servitors with various 'divine inspirations' and Siri improved her control over the ships subsystems by deep communion with the machine spirit/shamelessly hacking passwords and controlcodes. Admittedly, we were kinda abusing the fact that GM was not paying to close attentions to our shenanigans and we also ran our actions by him one at a time in order to obfuscate our grand scheme via fragmentation, but hey... \n\nMike returned after finding not to much useful stuff except 'raw materials' and mutants to find Siri and Tesla in a passionate embrace with their USB cables plugged into each other. He cleared his throat - via voxgrill - and expressed that, while he was happy for them, it would be appreciated if they could hold it in until they had the situation fixed. They apologized civically and Siri explained that, while she absolutely agreed with Mikes assessment, she could not help but fall for Teslas 'rugged yet well oiled and shiny looks' as well as his 'bad boy attitude and sharp intellect'. Mike and Tesla later, after Sire was out of sight, ~~brofisted~~ shook hands like gentlemen. This incident however sparked a series of barf-inducing machine-themed sexual innuendos that ultimately lead to the threat of having to roll against brain aneurisms. Love would not bloom on this ship, but, as Tesla put it: *\"Doesn't matter, had port-to-port data transfer with a hot chick\"*\n\nAnyway, after being kink-shamed back on track, we continued with the game: We had lost some servitors to mutant attacks, but then managed to quite elegantly solve that trouble by gaining control of the vessels life support, sealing in all lifesigns on our deck as well as the adjacent ones (also black decks) and reducing oxygen levels to zero. We then sent out squads of armed servitors to collect the bodies of any human collateral damages and throw the rest on the dump where we incinerated the waste from our servitor building program.\n\nThe mutant purging did however have an unpredicted consequence: With all our manipulating of power streams and the screwing around with the atmosphere, we triggered several red lights on the bridge and gave away our position to the shipmaster who promptly sent inquisitor Elana, sister Prettyface Whatshername and several armsmen down to us.\n\nTo say that we were annoyed at the two dozen meatbags barging into our sanctified workshop would be as much an understatement as saying the Emperor came down with a mild cough after his fight with Horus, especially since said meatbags actually had the gall to gun down several servitors doing the Omnissiahs work on their way. Needless to say, the binaric shitstorm  that hit them square in their flappy faces, amplified by roughly 150 servitor voxgrills synced up with Siri, was monumental.\n\nNow, a sensible, rational person would, when presented with such an overwhelming amount of valid criticism, sit down, listen, see that everything was entirely their fault and their fault alone and submit to be remade into a servitor by the Omnissiahs faithful servants. Sadly, neither Inquisitor Elena nor janitorial sister Premotess Smthnwhatnot - now for some reason wearing highly ornamental, golden power armor, a mastercrafted boltpistol and a relic powersword - and her two cronies - also wearing power armor and Godwy De'az pattern bolters - were either sensible nor rational. Instead of understanding that they had commited grievous crimes against the machine spirit of their vessel and the Omnissiah himself, harbored a Heretek - heretiot, Mike interjected - who illegally shared the Mechanicums secrets with uninitiated Ecclesiarchy serfs and watched as they basically raped the machines he was supposed to care for as well as insulting three high ranking Adeptus Mechanicus officials by  grossly mistreating them and not submitting to their undeniable authority in all things mechanical, they and their three dozen armsmen started gunning down servitors while constantly screaming \"SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!\".\n\nThe tension in the air was thick as we stepped in front of the crazed intruders. We knew that one wrong move could utterly escalate the situation and frankly, we were not to certain we  were ready to face power armor and militia support yet. But as it were, things went extremely well:\n\n**Inquisitor**: This insanity must stop. Now!\n\n**Siri**: We agree. Take those people into custody for crimes against the Ommnissiah!\n\n**Inquisitor**: Are you dense? *gestures at the room* I'm talking about this!\n\n**Mike**, in binary as he doesn't **speak** low gothic: If you were only half as incompetent as you are, inquisitor, none of this would be necessary. *Begins to go over everything wrong with the ship and its crew, being as passive aggressive as possible*\n\n**Inquisitor**: I DONT FUCKING SPEAK BINARY!!!\n\n**Mike**: THEN LEARN IT, YOU DUMB MONKEY!\n\n**Pentoles Unimportance**: Can someone please just translate?\n\n**Tesla**: *gesturing towards the inquisitor * My esteemed college suggested the dumb monkey finally learn binary. It's not that hard.\n\n**Inquisitor**: 😠\n\n**Sororitas**: 😒\n\n**Crew Cog**: 😐 \n\n**Penta-ass the janitor**: We can just lock them in here...\n\n**Tesla**: It's not as if we couldn't overwrite the door panel from in here, genius.\n\n**Penta-ass the Janitor**: Overwrite this. *puts a bolt round through the door panel*\n\nNow, a mechanical tidbit to note about Siri was that her player had made her with this modified Sororitas trait in which she had to make a will save whenever she witnessed a holy relic being destroyed/defiled/etc or go berserk...\n\nPenta-ass had the most smug look on her face, undoubtedly being super proud of her quip. Looking down the barrel of a gun, however, kinda put the breaks on her good humor though. Being shot point blank in the face by an infernopistol, a hand held anti tank weapon, even more so.\n\nNow, following the stunned silence that followed the janitors head going pop like a watermelon in a microwave, several things happened that could be well defined as, well, as an 'escalation'.\n\nThe inquisitor, finally having enough of this shit, shot down Siri.\n\nTesla, seeing his waifu and future manufactorum of his offspring being shot down, charged the inquisitor with his beefed up cybernetic arms and pummels the small woman into the wall, knocking her out cold.\n\nThe sororitas opened fire on Mike and Tesla.\n\nMike ordered the servitors, armed with high pressure nailguns and improvised flamethrowers, to open fire.\n\nThe armsmen are turned into a BBQ from all sides and nailed to the door - ironically nailing it shut - while the Sororitas refocus on Tesla who is wrecking shit like only a techpriest utterly geared towards combat can.\n\nThe Sororitas manage to shoot his foot off but ultimately die due to a combination of high-powered lasers, nails, fire, no cover and no exit.\n\n\"You madmen!\", the inquisitor moans. \"I will personally see everything you hold dear destroyed! You and your FUCKING MECHANICUM!\"\n\nAnd in that moment, hearing those hateful words, Mike came to a realization that shocked him to his core:\n\nThe inquisitor was a heretic.\n\nSo he shot her in the head.\n\nIts not over yet, there's still one part.

        "text": "I approached my group with a few ideas after one of the campaigns we had been doing ended two weeks ago. All of them were based off of videogame rpgs, this is the tale of the first of five campaigns we ran based on those ideas.\n\nSet up was the exact same as the game, except I had a DM NPC who managed the town with the help of the party. We had a cleric, a fighter, a warlock and a rogue. All of them human, we didn't use alignments in this game though, so they could be pretty off the wall at times due to the whole insanity shtick that comes from fighting eldrich horrors. The players were allowed to have them listed on their sheet for reference, but things like level dropping for acting out of character and the like wouldn't be used in this campaign.\n\nNone of the party had actually seen any monsters up until that point, all of them had been fighting humans. This was because i set the game on earth in england during the victorian era, so while the characters were still strong, they were still very grounded in our reality. The game didn't really get fully rolling for a few sessions, because they had to clear the road, then clear the town of bandits before settling in and making the place livable. They only fought people though, just bandits who used increasingly complex tactics until the rest of the convoy arrived with building materials, the rest of the towns NPC's and supplies. With the town set up, Lord dunstain tasked them with scouting out the local area...Then 'it' attacked.\n\n'it' was a troll, specifically one designed to be a bit beefier then the average, but it turned out to be a much more daunting encounter than any of the players thought it might be, because none of them had access to fire, or acid damage. I chose this monster purposefully, because I wanted to hammer in what combat was going to be like for this campaign. The reason they had only been fighting human enemies up until that point was to allow them to establish their characters, learn the world a bit, see the NPC's. But the troll was the other side of this coin, combat was not going to be a cake walk anymore. It wasn't a normal troll though, It was a hulking behemoth of mold, flesh and stone, tossing the players about like rag dolls. While it didn't do that much damage, as the attacks were mainly grapple based, the mental effect was visible, they were shaken by the experience.\n\nFrom then on, the campaign unfolded naturally, they got to pick which one of the areas they wanted to go to \\(I expanded the roster to include more than what is found in the game\\), did whatever task needed doing there, return, rinse and repeat. But they avoided the sewers after their first expedition.\n\nThe main entrance was a gaping hole jutting out of a hill, covered with a thick, rusted metal hatch who's lock had long ago been busted. The scent that hit them when they lifted the lid was enough to cause the rogue to vomit. The fetid stench of rotten meat and feces stuck with them every step of the way, their only guiding light was the clerics enchanced mace which acted as a torch, bringing illumination to a place long forgotten by the sun. Squeals and squelches dogged their every step, but their sources never seen. I never bothered to role stealth for the pigmen, the players always knew how close they were, but due to the low light, and the pigs knowledge of the tunnels, the players only saw what the pigmen wanted them to see.\n\nAt first it just seemed like a normal sewer...until the bodies began to pile up. At first it was skeletons, then decayed bodies, but soon enough they began to wade in rivers of ichor, rotten bodies lining the walls, watery eyes staring back at them, their torsos ripped open and their limbs removed. It had been over half an hour OOC time, and they had yet to fight a single thing, only pausing now and then to scavenge from the dead. While they did dig up the odd treasure, it was obvious these pink abominations had taken the best loot with them after their meals. Eventually they found a shaft of light shining down onto an untouched spot of the cobble stoned floor, with a single, hulking, dark skinned boar on two legs standing right under it.\n\nRather than turn back, they readied themselves for a fight. The boar snorted and smashed his rusty cleaver against his shield, summoning seven more pigmen, all of various stages of mutation and mutilation, to his side. The way i had the pigmen fight was very specific. All of them had resistance to acid damage, and some of them were mutated enough to be weak in melee, but use their own blood, stomach acids and shit as dangerous weapons. So the bigger pig men threw the smaller ones at the players, let them get killed, so their blood and stomach acids would pool on the floor and make the area dangerous for the players, then have others fire volleys of bodily fluids to cause diseases, or just hurt them, while the bigger beasts waded in with their cleavers to hack up what remained.\n\nThe players were smart enough to go back into the tunnel and make their numbers count for little...But this encounter was designed with 12 pigmen in mind, not just 8. So the way back was blocked by 4 more. They fought bravely, but it was clear that they'd be dead if they didn't figure out a way to make the enemy flee, or escape themselves. The fighter was engaged in melee with the leader, and would have probably died in the next round if the cleric hadn't used guiding bolt to help land a critical hit. That's when the players learned the main weakness of the pigmen, they are cowardly, and rely on strong leaders. The enemy broke rank instantly, fleeing in all directions, leaving the party to pick up some valuables from the remains and retreat with barely any sense of true victory despite what they overcame.\n\nThey didn't return empty handed however,some of the items they found were magical, including a cracked wand of dispel magic, good for one use, along with a few other trinkets \\(Golden chains, some nice weaponry, even a pauldron of bull rushing.\\). The warlock then decided to reach out with his mind, to try and contact his patron in the hopes of getting a response...He did, and started running towards where he thought he heard it. Not due to a failed save, because he thought he was going to meet it. The party followed, not for gold, but for fear of their friends life. Deeper and deeper they delved until they found themselves slipping on gore caked slopes, spitting them out at the bottom, the flesh pit.\n\nIt had once been the central cistern, filled with water and fecal matter. But with so many bodies left to drift down into the depths, flesh rotting away and sinking to the bottom, it had turned into a single vat of stinking meat. Webbed skin crawling across the walls, twitching limbs half heartedly grasping out, faces mouthing from beneath the puss ridden masses. In the centre of it all was a thick, bulbous egg, coated in slime and sinew. The warlock was already half way down the walkway, making his way to it. Convinced that this was his patron. He spoke to it, drawing it from it's slumber. Two eyes slid out of unseen slits, a mouth parting at the base, the pod creature rippling as it responded in a tongue that no one understood, except the warlock. It wanted him, it wanted to consume him and embrace him, to make him part of it's collective.\n\nIt was then that the other players learned two things about the warlock, he was neutral evil, and his patron was the seeker, a patron of learning. We had established in his backstory that the dreams he had of his patron were disturbing, mainly revolving around tombs made of flesh and endless whisperings of creativity and becoming one with knowledge. I had planned for it to be none other than the King In Yellow, he who shall not be named, the Golden Mark, Hastur. But as he was just a fledgling warlock of level 2, he did not know such things, and for character purposes, thought that this abomination before him was his patron.\n\nHe willingly sacrificed himself to it by letting it stretch out, distorting its shape, the face moving off of the egg shape and out towards him. The mouth slowly opening, expanding, hovering over him before descending slowly to consume...He would have died right there and then if it wasn't for a well placed grease spell and the rogue throwing his grappling hook to yank him away. They rolled for initiative...but this thing was using the stats of a modified elder brain. So they had little hope of beating it, but it didn't attack in the first round, it simply stared at the warlock, spoke again, and the vat of flesh around it began to slowly crawl up the walls and walkway, attempting to block escape but without harming them. The players were able to escape, with the warlock knocked out over the fighters shoulder, but only just.\n\nThey ran for ages, the squeals of pigmen echoing all around them as they tried to find an exit. Their best bet was to just keep heading upwards. But their luck seemed to run out when they came to a flat wall, they probably would have died if the fighter hadn't had the bright idea to smash the wall with his hammer, leading them out into the catacombs, an entirely seperate area. Once they crossed the threshold, they saw the horde of pigmen slow down and stop, glaring at them from their side of the darkness, one by one they slunk back into their caves, leaving the players alone to wallow among the dead...and undead.\n\nThey got out easily enough, as the catacombs were laid out in a much easier to understand fashion. They did encounter some undead, but nothing the cleric and fighter couldn't deal with, especially as the rogue proved his worth by using the enviroment to take out most of some of the larger groups, smashing them with chandeliers and the like. By the time they returned to the town, they were all exhusted. Lord dunstein made sure to get them food and water while they told him what they had found, documenting every last detail before they turned their attention to the warlock.\n\nHe had been 'ok' by his standards once he was awake, and the party had elected to give him a bollocking once they were back to the town. It was only when the other players noticed he hadn't said a single word since they had stepped into town that they realized he had been in a trance after getting there. It was then the warlock learned of his patrons true nature, of his grave mistake, and gained a boon as a reward for discovering some new secrets. The roleplay between the party after that was fantastic, I didn't even need to say or do anything as they slowly evolved. It ended with the party agreeing to stick together and to agree not to split up ever again.\n\nThey never returned to the sewers after that, the flesh egg haunting their memories, on some nights the warlock still hearing it's voice, remembering the last words it spoke to him. \"We are all flesh, and we shall all be one again, to form a whole that will be perfect.\"",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/8g0jjn/pathfinder_sumo_monk_leaping_fatso_crouching_twink/",
        "text": "This comes from one of my favourite groups, where we used to do all kinds of crazy shit. One of the players in particular loved doing really off the wall characters, and during a session zero, he came to me and asked if he could play an overweight man for the monk class. I instantly knew what he was doing and i wrote up some stats for the \"race\" right on the spot, I'll provide them at the end.\n\nSoga masu was a monk of the iron mountain, this meant that so long as he didn't move, you couldn't hurt him, or move him. His strength stat was a flat 20, his constitution was 16, but his dexterity was 4, charisma was 4 as well. We ended up modifying the monk class a bit, removing things like fast movement, evasion, etc. So by the end, as long as he didn't move, he had no dex penalty to his AC, and while his base movement speed was just 20 feet, he could jump really far.\n\nThe campaign was a plane jumping affair. They began it all in the shadowfell, eventually getting shunted between the planes before having the ability to traverse anywhere they wanted with the use of a cubic gate, which was also a magic item called Dick, a mad mage who split his mind up between several artifacts and scattered them...the plot wasn't focused around him, Dick was just a reoccurring character in my campaigns. Had him inside a rod of wonder once.\n\nSoga wasn't great in 'offensive' combat situations, because he was surprisingly easy to avoid for most enemies, he only really shined in tight areas like dungeons, which I took into account after a while when designing things. Eventually though, he got access to high jump. High jump allows a monk to add his level to any roll he makes to jump, and can spend ki to add 20 to it for a round. It's the counter\\-song ability of monks, not used that often, but definitely important at the right moment. Soga abused this like hell, because we calculated jump distance as a one to one scale, the result you got on the dice, combined with your bonuses, is how far you went in meters. Suddenly we had this chronically overweight sumo leaping forty, sometimes fifty feet, cannonballing down onto people for a slam attack \\(Basically an unarmed attack, but calculated as if he were two sizes larger than he actually was\\), he was bellyflopping people to death.\n\nAfter the party had gotten their hands on a dick in a box, i was content to let them have a few sessions of roaming around to wherever they felt like, provided that they let me know which location they had all agreed upon before the session so i knew what to prepare in advance. They were wise enough to avoid hell, but did poke around a demon lords realm a bit for a task from an efreeti lord. But they eventually found their way to the shadowfell again in order to figure out more regarding some ruins they had encountered back there.\n\nNormally, the shadowfell is a ruined, depressing reflection of the material plane, it's rare to find anything that isn't a smouldering pile of gloom and doom. So when they approached the solid ivory tower covered in runes, they knew I had been baiting them, and they took it hook, line and sinker. The tower was a seal for an arch shadow fae i had made, the patron saint of emo \"that guy\" characters. The party wizard, an onmyouji style spellcaster with a thing for scrolls, instantly figured out the magic, but not what it kept locked up. They poked around a bit until they found a patch where the walls runes had been shaved off, another good role and they realized that it reached below the ground.\n\nTurns out that there were drow here, performing a ritual underneath the tower at it's foundations to slowly erase the protective ward. The party could have fought their way down to them, but instead they stone shaped downwards until they got to a thin layer of rock...which Soga promptly jumped down on, crashed through, and killed the head priest by smashing him for 72 points of damage because of his own weight, and the weight of the rocks. He was fine though, soga had used slowfall on himself to lessen the blow to himself. The rest of the party were kinda screwed though, since the wizard didn't know feather fall. So they continued to use stone shape to try and get down while soga was leaping on top of the drow, suffocating them under his fat when he wasn't sumo slapping them. He ended up teabagging this tiny dark elf while the rest of the drow surrounded him, choking him out while remaining in a crouched defensive stance.\n\nBy the time the party had gotten down to meet him, the guy had killed half of the ritual performers and was pounding the guy he was choking out between his buttcheeks into the ground with a flurry of blows. Enter the newest player of the group, who was in the group for an entire session before leaving.\n\nHe had made a drow rogue, not your standard rebel against race type, but an assassin for one of the heads of a drow noble family. I dug up some of my old notes and I gotta say, they are a treat. He duel wielded katana, wore a trench coat made of black dragon scales, had a pair of true sight goggles which were designed to be shades, high leather boots with spurs that acted like spider climb boots, etc. This guy was an edge lord through and through. He was also only 50, drows reach adulthood at age 110, so this guy was an emo twink.\n\nThe plan we had discussed was that his guy would join up with the party to help take out the drow cult or something like that. We all knew that IC it would be a tad tense, but there was an agreed rule that you didn't actively try to dick over other members of the party...He fell from the ceiling and failed to sneak attack Soga, also failing his acrobatics check to not hurt himself on the landing, dealing about 20 points of damage to himself. The two of them got into a fight while the rest of the party tried to kill the other escaping cultists and the twink drow, Little did he know that it was basically impossible to cause serious damage to Soga, especially as he had just gotten his hands on an amulet of natural armour.\n\nIn the end, Soga just bitch slapped him for 50 points of none lethal damage to knock him out with the use of a flurry of blows. They tied him up, got to talking to him, and the twink was able to convince them that he wasn't on the cultists side, but they didn't let him out of the rope. Guy got really weird about being tied up, pretending it was arousing, creeped us all out enough to a point where Soga slapped him for some more none lethal damage while they dragged him along. A little while later when they found a tunnel that led down to a elfgate \\(think star gate, but only elves can activate them\\), the cultists were just about to go through with some beefy guards. They decided to give the twink one last chance to redeem himself and prove that he was against the cultists, untying him, handing him one of his swords back, and pushing him out to the other drow so he could talk to them and try and make an opening for the rest of the group.\n\nAt the top of his lungs, after he was fifty feet from the group, he yelled \"HELP, THE INFIDELS ARE COMING, HELP ME BROTHERS!\". Soga killed him one round later with his famous butt slam, which caused the player of the drow twink to rage quit because 'everyone else was bullying him'. We tried to explain things, but after he tried to literally flip the table, we kicked him out and continued the session as if he was never there. Soga and the others killed the rest of the drow before continuing on, after that day, soga the sumo wore his black leather boots with pride.\n\n\\-\\-\n\nObese human\n\ntype: Humanoid \\(human\\)\n\nSize: Medium\n\n\\+2 Str\n\n\\-2 Dex\n\n\\+2 Con\n\n\\-2 Cha\n\nMovement speed: 20\n\nOverweight: The creature counts as being one category size larger when calculating weight, fitting armour and food consumption.

Several parties that my DM manages during the week came together \\(with the help of a few other DMs he mentors\\) to enact a huge civil war in a large port town. \\(I missed the first session, so this is the part 2\\) \n\nWe were fighting \\(ostensibly\\) for either the circle of Weages or the King in Purple to get control over the town. However, unbeknownst to the majority of the parties, two out of the 5 parties that were there, were in fact fighting for a third reason. The two *evil* parties \\(of which i was a part\\) were working to free the Lord of Ice \\(a demon\\) from his icy prison. \n\nSince my party did a pretty good job in the last session, most of the good parties doing what we'd liked and assumed that we were working towards the good of the city. So, when the ice devils invaded the city, we were ordered by the King \\(who we were all following\\) to fight the ice devils in different parts of the city to defend it at all costs. My party split up, two of us were with the other evil party, and our tanks were with another group. The DM running our table clearly wasn't briefed because when we rolled over to the ice devils he looked shellshocked. Literally went, please pass. Go. He had to go out and take a smoke and was really sad for the rest of the session. On the other hand, the other two party members betrayed the other party and knocked out their wizard and teleported out of the encounter \\(using the Hand of Vecna, passing his charisma check\\).\n\nThe final showdown was as the evil parties were trying to escape the city and a massive pvp between 16 players, managed by 3 DMs. Almost all the evil party members \\(including myself, but i pretty much committed suicide\\) died, Vecna was released into the material plane and the City pretty much became an icy hellscape. The good parties escaped with their lives, mostly. Though I managed to knock out 3 of them with 2 fireball attacks. It would have been more but one was a raging barbarian \\- which made me a little sad. ",

        "text": "I should have realized what kind of campaign this was going to be during the session zero, when the first question's they all asked were \"can we play ogres?\" and \"can we all play ogres?\". We messed with the stats a little and made a homebrew race for ogres, just sorta letting them be a thing in the universe like orcs, trolls, elves and the like. Only issue is that them being ogres was the groups entire defining trait.\n\nWe had a decent mix of types, two street samurai, a shaman, and a decker. There was also an NPC rigger i used who did all the driving and occasionally helped out in operations. They just kept calling him donkey rather than his actual name. The first thing they did was get the druid to have a background revolving around his swamp being destroyed, the decker was always hyped up on magic mushrooms and the two samurai were brothers who came from the bayou states of america but moved on after their small town got 'shreked\".\n\nThe campaign was set in berlin, mainly so that they'd be able to go full anarchy without too many problems, but i shouldn't have let them have that much freedom, because the moment after i was finished introducing them to the city and their current living arrangements \\(an abandoned section of the sewers which hadn't seen shit flow through the pipes in years\\), they got strange. They discussed how to pull off heists without being recognized, and they instantly ordered 4 shrek masks off the internet before going to their first client, a hans muller type character who told them that they needed to clear out an old building beside an industrial district of theirs for an expansion, the catch being the place was packed with spirit possessed junkies. Pay was standard, and they were offered access to some nice cybertech afterwards, so they went for it.\n\nThey called themselves the shreking crew when he asked what he should list the job payment under, and that was when i realized it was going to be one of those campaigns. They even asked me why i was sticking one of my folders away after the end of the first session, and I told them that if they had wanted to do a joke campaign they should have let me know, one of them tried to defend the idea, and i summed it up pretty perfectly \"you're four homeless ogre bums from the swamp wearing shrek masks, one of your battle cries is literally the german word for onions. This onion doesn't have many layers to it, just one thick slice right to the core.\" I was...annoyed, considering that this was initially going to be a serious campaign, but i rolled with it. I didn't put anywhere near as much effort in as i normally did after that though, no real need to flesh out NPC's or factions or anything like that, just provide them with increasingly bizzare jobs until they killed themselves.\n\nTheir first job went off well enough, with them taking out the shrine at the top by blowing up holes on all the levels, then taking out the ground underneath it so it fell ten stories and shattered on the ground floor. One of the street samurai had both his arms removed and replaced with flails that turned into normal hands when needed, the other one replaced his arm with a chainsaw. Later he would be known as the meat grinder, due to his insane desire to have both arms replaced with chainsaws...his cock replaced with a chainsaw, and for his teeth to be replaced with drills.\n\nA few weird jobs later, which involved kidnapping a agricultural scientist who specialized in bulb plants from a lab which had recently been overrun with mutated plant life, another which had them assassinate a gang leader who was getting too much turf, and lastly an attack on a facility to steal some drugs...half of which they kept. After that I was getting bored, but they were having fun, so I played along for a while, but, for the sake of my own amusement I made things weirder and darker.\n\nThese guys did not have a nice reputation, they were loud, violent, brutish murderers who all smelt like shit. So whenever they hunted for jobs, some of the ones sent to them were always pretty disgusting, like burning down an orphanage in order to make way for an apartment block, or doing unspeakable things to high up employees within various companies. They took the nicer jobs for a while, but they were really playing up the whole brutality element, getting particularly uncomfortable when one of them used his chainsaw dick during an interrogation scene. \n\nI finally decided it was time to end this particular campaign, because it was going nowhere and getting a bit out of hand. They were still having fun, but I was miserable at this point and I felt like i should at least give them a good final send off. There is this xenophobic group called the Humanis policlub, basically the KKK but on a global scale. I had the players do a job or two for them without realizing it, one being an attack on some clinics with cyberware inside, the other being a job to weaken some of the better sections of the city by destroying the sewer systems here and there under the pretense of screwing over one of the mega corps by flooding their underground tram lines.\n\nThere is a famous event known as the night of rage in shadow run, basically think of the hutu tutsi genocide, with humans mass killing meta humans, that's what the night of rage was. This was supposed to be the night of rage part 2, where the players accidentally helped the bad guys, and would help the others for a hefty sum...Nope, not even close to what happened. Their shaman had long ago gone full crazy, and talked the rest of the group into flooding all the tram stations in the city with the explosives they had left over from their prior jobs. so they did just that in order to try and turn berlin into their own mega swamp.\n\nIn the end, i had the humanis policlub hunt them down as potential narks to their plans, sending a few privately funded kill squads after them, and the last thing the shaman said before combat was \"get outta meh swamp!\". Battle was brutal, some of their explosives were used in the fight, it didn't end particularly well, all of them were nearly dead, but they carried on with the plan as if it had never happened, so then i sent in another squad of soldiers from one of the mega corps, because the trams are just as important to them as it is to everyone else. Same result, the players were basically so close to death that they should have died, but they kept on setting up C4 along the water lines and sewer lines.\n\nThey nearly finished setting it all up when i realized something...they were on the rail tracks under ground. There was a chance for them to escape, a side door for maintenance, but it was locked. None of them were smart enough to realize a thrust of a chainsaw dick, or anything else would have probably busted it open...so they suicide bombed themselves against the door and blew up a decent section of the subway, flooding even more of it.\n\nAfter the game they got pissy with me about how i purposefully TPK'd them, it took me one sentence to explain why they had a chance to escape, \"you could have broken down the door.\" After that we didn't play for months, whenever one of them asked me to DM I  turned it down. I was still annoyed about the shreking crew, it shreked our friendship. We played about two more campaigns together after that, but then I stopped DMing that group. They wanted some whacky, no consequences fun and I wanted to make a story with real characters that mattered.",

        "text": "There was a stretch of time with one of my groups where we only played the warhammer 40k tabletop rpgs, I ran only war and death watch mostly. This is the story of how my players learned to fear tight, moist places.\n\nThe set up was that a mini warp storm had occurred near one of these hive worlds, a planet dedicated to housing people. It circled a forge world, a planet dedicated to creating things, with the two of them producing battleships which weren't as good as the relic battleships from the past, but they were managing to make them of a similar scale. The warpstorm had allowed the place to become infected with a plague made by nurgle, corrupting pretty much everyone on the planet into a base, violent psychopath.\n\nThe planet was too close to a forge world to simply destroy, and there were lots of valuable relics and information tucked away on it, so, a deathwatch squad was brought together, armed and sent off to activate a bio\\-bomb which contained a bacteria which would rapidly break down proteins across the entire planet, removing the current population and allowing it to be repopulated again with civilians from other worlds. The only problem was that this kind of tech wasn't just lying around, it was stored in special bunkers, with the closest one being at the very bottom of the hive worlds main hive.\n\nThe group consisted of a heavy from the imperial fist chapter, a captain from the ultra marines, a melee specialist who was from the dark angels, and a psyker from the blood angels. They had a choice, did they want to land directly in the hive, or outside of it. After talking over the pro's and cons, they were fired directly at the hive. The impact destroyed a block of apartments, pummeling them into nothing but smoldering red hot metal and charred corpses, the pod itself was jammed into the ground and the marines had to punch their way out onto a road. The blast might have alerted the entire city to their presence, but it also killed everyone within a small radius of the landing site, so they weren't all that bothered. \n\nThey started making their way downwards, jumping in deeper and deeper until their first real fight. They originally thought they were going to be fighting zombies, or insane cultists, but they were fighting an entire hive filled with emotionless psychopaths. One of them smashed right through a shitty walkway and landed in a huge vat of sewage, only to be swarmed by people with lazer cutters, trying to slice away his armour and pull him out of his suit, meanwhile the others were getting shot at from both sides, but the enemies weren't aiming at them, rather, it was the floor. sending them crashing down into this nasty pit along with their friend. They did eventually manage to kill most of them before they broke rank and fled, but after that they could see this was not going to be a simple cut and dry affair. They took to sewer tunnels to hide, repair and regroup before moving on, but they couldn't have picked a worse place to hide.\n\nNurgle had sent some minions down there as well, to keep spreading the plague, and one in particular was barreling through the tunnels, slamming right into the squad at the speed of a train, coating them in acid and ooze while pushing them out and into a massive shit vat. another intense fight, and they finally realized two things. the first, was they had no idea where the bunker was, and the second, the bottom half of the hive was no place for a space marine.\n\nThey made their way back up, which was almost as difficult as getting down there in the first place, with landmines being the bane of their existence, forcing them to fall back down to lower levels only to climb up again and encounter an ambush. These guys were armed to the teeth, but the heavy was starting to run out of ammo, as was everyone else except the psyker and the melee specialist who could keep fighting for days. They pushed up to the nobles district to find the central hub of information at a tech\\-priest stronghold, which turned out to be the only safe haven. Since most of them were mostly robotics and wires, the virus had little to no effect, so the space marines loaded up, found the location of the bunker and...were promptly loaded into another pod. The tech priest had talked them into letting him test out a pod mortor gun which allowed pods to be fired from the ground and arc into enemy strongholds. \n\nThis did not end well. In fact, it went so poorly, that they landed an entire three miles off target, right in the dead centre of ground zero, where the virus first spread. They were attacked by mad men in cars who had loaded space marine guns onto the sides of their vehicles, spinning around and firing wildly, with plasma cutters grafted onto the front to make a sort of battering ram that could hurt the squad. Not that it did too much, as one of the marines sliced most of the cars that came too close in half with his shiny new force sword. they left the destruction rally in ruins, but they had to make a move as they now had an entire small stadium of angry fans chasing after them.\n\nSome more jumping down insanely deep holes later and they were back to trudging down sewer pipes, getting attacked by disgusting mutant spawn that damn near TPK'd them when one got it's hands on a granade. But that near TPK lead to the actual TPK, because the granade alerted everything in the tunnel system with the shockwave. As they were closed in and had no obvious escape routs, they stood back to back and fought of hordes of retarded demi\\-humans, running out of ammo, the psyker eventually started using bigger abilities...one of which resulted in a will failure. \n\nIn warhammer 40k, psykers are dudes who can manipulate the energy of the world around them, inside themselves and this place called the warp in order to mess with reality, but because this is warhammer 40k, you can't do this safely. Because the chaos gods hate safety. He rolled, i then rolled the negative result...as we were using a homebrew version of the table from a third party company, which had 1000 different outcomes, the roll was particularly bad.\n\nSuddenly, the psyker began to grow, filling up the pipe they were in, his armour busting off and buckling, slowly crushing everything in the pipe, including the other marines. Expanding to the point where the pipe they were in burst and they tumbled down into an open space which, ironically, was the location of the vault they needed to get to. But they didn't notice and instead tried to figure out what to do about the slowly expanding fleshy mass that was their friend...one of them had the bright idea to poke him with a force sword. Instant warp explosion was what happened, killing the melee specialist, the psyker, and the heavy. The last guy was so close to death that he just decided to blow himself up by setting off all the granades he had with him and take as many enemies as he could.\n\nThe planet was written off and nuked from orbit anyway after the failed death watch mission, losing even more of the history mankind had struggled so hard to maintain.",

        "text": "My players and I had just lost about two guys who left for various personal reasons, leaving us with just four people, three players and myself. The campaign which we had finished sooner than expected in order to allow them to end with a degree of satisfaction was done, and I wasn't in the mood to craft another massive world for next week, so we decided to do something stupid and awesome.\n\nI looked through the bestiaries \\(for 3.5 and pathfinder\\) and collected up all the stat blocks for gods, demon lords, arch angels and the like, modifying them slightly here and there until they were all pretty much at the same CR level, then laid them out on the game table in stacks. Each player would pick up their favoured faction, and I'd get the last one while also DMing the entire thing.\n\nThe set up was pretty easy to understand, there is a module from second edition D&amp;D called the apocalypse stone, basic jist is the party takes this stone from its sacred resting place and causes the entire universe to begin falling apart as it acted as the pin which kept it all stuck together. I used a modified version of this where Asmodeus's contract with the other gods expired, which allowed him to openly wage war, but the hole he punched in the universe allowed the abyss to flood through as well by weakening the walls. The angels came in to stop this and hopefully win. Due to the sudden massive influx of death, many gods of the dead were suddenly awakened, empowered and lured to the call of battle in order to bring about the death of existence.\n\nI was slotted with my favorite of the four, the undead \\(My players knew me too well\\). While I wont name names here, lets call the leader of the angels gabe, the leader of the devils luke, and the leader of the demons paz.\n\nThe way the \"armies\" were listed, there was one \"leader\" character, who was pretty much the most powerful of each faction. For the undead, we had atropus, the afterbirth of existence. In the devils corner, we had Asmodeus, teller of the first lie, committer of the first murder and ruler of hell's tenth layer. Surging up from the demonic pit we had tiamat, five headed goddess of chromatic dragons, she who burns all in passion and fury. For the angels side, it was initally going to be bahamut, but in the end he went for saint cuthburt of all things, wielder of the wooden club and converter to the truth faith.\n\nWe all poured some money in to get decent models for each deity, sadly no one sold atropus mini's or anything that matches the description of a melted pale fat guy with a black blob for a head and long raked claws, so I made do with a wooden buddah statue with his head covered in black play dough. \n\nThe guys showed up as usual with snacks, beer and the like. I normally didn't allow booze, or overly messy snacks, but considering this was a dumb one off, I didn't give a shit. The set up was given with overly dramatic flare, and without too much messing around, within ten minutes of us sitting down we had all four of our statues on the battle mat and hungry for blood.\n\nGiven that every one of us had a shit ton of every ability you could want, the battle was brutal and often shifting focus from one target to the next. First Asmodeus went in with his mace to smash cuthburt in, but that wooden branch kept the flames at bay while Tiamat sank her teeth into the embodiment of the end, Atropus slowly decaying one of her heads in each hand. Existence shook with the clash of weaponry, divine wood against unholy steel smashing into the opposing figure, splattering divinity infused ichor across entire planets, coating them in seas of blood. Suns were thrown like marbles from a necklace of fireballs, supernovas echoing across the endless sky, billions of lives blasted apart in every shockwave that rippled through space\\-time.\n\nWe spend the better part of three hours beating the shit out of each other, listening to damn well whatever we felt like, moving from iron maiden to loviatar and even some synth at one point. But even a god must fall, and the first to go was Tiamat. Drowning in the endless sea of putrid, toxic blood that seeped from a chunk of reality that existence forgot, her body slowly withered and rotted from the inside, her lungs filled with this thick sludge while foul hands worked their way inwards, slicing off neck after neck until she was nothing but a mutilated, rot covered corpse that slowly broke into infinite pieces.\n\nThe next to die was Asmodeus, his horns were shattered, his red skin covered in black blood, golden eyes now bloodshot, his limitless gaze now focused on the man before him, iris visible for the first time since the birth of the material plane. For all his words, he could not bring one to the split lip of his broken jaw, the most he could do was repeat the last sound his brother did during his murder, a long, protracted bellow of sorrow, anger, anguish and hatred just before his face was caved in, his teeth sticking out of the wooden club as cuthburt kicked him back through the portal to hell, his immense corpse crushing several sections of the nine known layers.\n\nNow I knew why he had chosen saint cuthburt, he was a god level paladin, and his smite evil ability? He had been saving it for me, but I had a few tricks of my own, namely the one which allowed me to create minions from those slain near me. I didn't use the corpses of the other gods, but I did channel it into the form of some CR 17 undead, three of them only. But they didn't last long, only long enough for me to get in a few extra hits, fatally wounding him, but not before he was able to cut the tie between the afterbirth and the babe, his mace crushing the black lump that was atropus's head, and slamming down further, mushing the fetid flesh across the edge of reality, beating it against the barrier over and over again until it faded from the known world.\n\nI calmly took my play dough buddah from the table, and narrated as if cuthburt and the angels had won...until i pulled out my cthulhu miniature. \"The gods of abyss are dead, nothing guards the way to the rest of the planes now, hell is empty, the chains throughout it no longer constantly maintained. That which is undead has been expunged, but in its wake something else arises to take it's place...roll initiative, cuthburt, for the blind idiot god has come.\"\n\nI let him heal up with a single wish spell from another god, handed my other players some stat cards for some arch angels who weren't as powerful as cuthburt, and prepared for a surprise final encounter.  Azathoth had a similar card to Atropus, but with enough changes to make it much more bizzare, unsettling and strange to fight. Even though this was pathfinder, I did let myself have legendary actions to even things out against 2 arch angels and a god.\n\nUnsurprisingly the two arch angels died really quickly, one had their wings ripped from their body before being swallowed whole, disintegrated in the raw chaos that composed the heart of madness, the other soon joined them after trying to pin down the uncountable tentacles that fluctuated across his body, being trapped within them and drawn in to sate his endless hunger.\n\nCuthburt's smite ability didn't work on Azathoth, for he is not evil, only apathetic, for it understands nothing. So he ended up taking the fallen mace of amodeus, using the fallen prince of hell's mace to repeatedly pound the oncoming mass of oblivion, taking round after round of full attacks and the occasional spell like ability that blasted off chunks off of the infinite wave. But the end was very unexpected, Gabe looked me dead in the eye and said \"can I talk to all the angels?\" and I said yes, so he gave a rousing speech as he fought back the end, appealing to their sense of good and justice before demanding their power to help keep the world as it should be. We didn't need him to roll, the guy had charisma and bonuses so high that it was instantly successful. \n\nPulling back for one last attack, he pooled all of that energy, and all the energy of his own divinity into one last shot, sacrificing levels, hit points, everything for this one blast which hit the blind idiot god in the form of a massive ball of spirit energy, destroying it all in the process. Then, I calmly sat back and narrated the wind down, smoothly linking in the last battle of good and evil which ended with the destruction of everything to give the next cycle a proper chance, leading to the creation of earth.",

        "text": "The accompanying **[comic lives over here](http://www.handbookofheroes.com/archives/comic/competition)**, but here be my tale. Ahem:\n\nI came to D&amp;D late in life. It was my then-girlfriend's dad’s group that took me in. They were patient, explained how the rules worked, and (since this was 3.5) they re-explained when I got confused. They even incorporated a few of my crackpot ideas into the game (My dragon paladin is from an ancient civilization buried beneath your setting! You’ve never heard of it!). But there is an incident that sticks out in my mind as a hiccup on the road to good gaming. It involved a wrestling match.\n\nThat long-ago campaign had been going for years, and there was a pretty-dang-beefy half-giant in the party. She was a barbarian with a Strength score well into the 30s, and was very much the group’s “me smash puny weaklings!” PC. You know the type: lots of rage and muscle attached to a short fuse and a low Int score. I’d improvised some bizarre “in my country we settle legal disputes through gladiatorial combat” backstory, and so described myself as a lawyer. I forget what exactly caused the argument, but looking back, I think that my gold-dragon-lawyer-paladin sounds pretty punchable. Suffice it to say that this half-giant and I stumbled into some sort of disagreement. We wound up going no-holds-barred in the t̶a̶v̶e̶r̶n̶  square ring, and that’s where the trouble started.\n\nNow it was the GM that built my character for me. He knows what he’s doing when it comes to optimizing, and it turned out that he’d given me a slightly OP dude. He must have figured that the extra oomph would make up for my lack of experience. When it comes to “who can roll higher on a contested Grapple check” however, skill doesn’t really enter into it. I won handily at the thing Ms. Giant was supposed to be best at. The giant was less than pleased, and so was the player. Can’t say that I blame her. I paid for the damages in the tavern, but some things a couple hundred gp can't fix.\n\nLooking back on the incident now, I suspect that the classic lineup of fighter/cleric/wizard/thief is popular not simply because it works, but because it gives everybody a clearly defined role. Fighter is the best at fighting. Thief gets to be the skill guy. Wizard and Cleric handle offensive and defensive magic respectively, and everybody feels like they’re the best at their own thing. Having a well-defined role in the group allows you to carve out your own little chunk of conceptual real estate. You’re the lord of your chosen domain, and that feeling ties straight into the lizard brain power fantasy at the heart of this hobby. Finding out that some Johnny-come-lately has come to kick you off of your property makes your character feel lesser: less powerful, less interesting, and certainly less special.\n\nSo even though she will likely never read this: Apologies to the half-giant barbarian of my youth. You am strong, and deserve to smash puny weaklings. ",

This story comes from the time when we used only the norse god pantheon and set the entire game in a heavily modified and magicked version of finland, sweden and norway.  Accessing the other realms across the world trees branches, and otherwise just causing good ol' viking havoc.\n\n\nThe players for the game had four characters, a human fighter called Calder, there was a witch called Norin, a dwarven alchemist who's name i forgot, and a warpriest of loki. The end result was pretty effective, all things considered, everyone stuck to their character for the most part and given the society they lived in, it was fine to be a bit more murder hobo than normal.\n\n\nThings got strange however, once I began introducing other religions. You see, i based the whole religion thing for this campaign loosely off of d&amp;d's planescape, but instead of all religions existing, only all of earths religions exist at the same time, but no one knows which one is the pantheon to have created the world. This meant that it was quite common for holy wars to occur, but instead of a holy war, missionaries began entering the lands of the viking, spreading the word of Christianity.\n\n\nThe party had been doing mostly viking things up until then, like taking down big, nasty monsters, dealing with strange fae creatures, killing an evil cannibal witch, the usual. They were returning from a raid on england when they heard the news about that small cult they had blown off, having blossomed into a slowly developing religion. The reasons why varied, some people simply said they liked the sound of heaven better than valhalla, and a god that was merciful but firm, who cared about them. I did however need to state to my players OOC that i wouldn't be able to put up a deep philosophical debate for the virtues of Christianity over being an odinist/pagen/whatever. A bit annoying for the cleric of loki, but we found other means, like roleplaying the reasons why people joined and stuff, rather than the actual content of the holy books, because no one but the missionaries had read them.\n\n\nLoki, the god, was quite pissed at this invasion of the norse gods territory, and commanded his cleric to go investigate and see what was going on. The others had reasons for heading that way as well, like calder's hometown having apparently been converted, and nornin just hating priests in general, the dwarf was drunk most of the time and he wanted to drink some of that \"blood of christ\" wine they kept on talking about.\n\n\nThey had a few side adventures along the way, with the most notable being that they accidentally murdered a little girl because they thought she was a ghost, but apparently she was just alive and missing. When they got to Calders hometown, called holmgada, they found that the central longship hut of the chief had been turned into a makeshift church, and everyone in the town had been converted. At first they just assumed that everyone was a limp dicked wimp who bowed down to this new god, so they tried to figure out what was going on by kidnapping one of the townsfolk while he went out hunting, and beat the shit out of him until he revealed everything. Amazingly they didn't kill him, instead they stuffed him into a bag of holding with a bottle of air shoved in his mouth after tying him up.\n\n\nTurns out that the priests had brought gifts of wine and sweet spiced bread to curry favour before helping the community, slowly converting everyone...Until the dwarf, out of the blue, figured it out. He yelled at the top of his voice, both in and out of game \"they drugged the wine!\". Motherfucker got it first time without even trying, so i rewarded him with some special booze after they slept that night from the gods. I was pissed that he figured it out, and that he had the decency to confirm it by stealing a sample and make an alchemy check on it, but I'll be damned if i'm going to punish smart thinking like that.\n\n\nBecause everyone was drinking jesus kool aid, they knew that they'd have to figure out a different way of saving the town, so they got a hireling from a different town, a druid friend of theirs from a prior adventure, and had them scout the church out before breaking in and tampering with the barrels of wine, the dwarf having figured out prior to the heist how to counteract the drugs, making a big batch of stuff to do the job. For four none stealth characters, they did an amazing job at it. They left the town alone for a few days, going off to help their druid friend with something while they waited for the town to just murder the priests. But when they got back, nope, everything was still mostly the same, except the people were all even more docile than before.\n\n\nThey had forgotten to check to see if the golden cross the size of a man inside the long house was magical. It was basically a sort of a powerful spell amplifier that made a spell like charm person last for days, but only worked for christian spellcasters. The townsfolk were basically sheep at that point, obeying the lord of father woodstock to a T. Before you ask, yes, father woodstock was a bard, using a sub class i specifically made that allowed the bard to use heavy metal music. To recap, we had vikings fighting a christian death metal band.\n\n\nThey couldn't just go in swords blazing \\(literally, in the case of Calder\\), because the townsfolk would just attack them with their sheep mentality of weak alone, strong in a group ideology...and viking weaponry. So instead they launched a mini holy war, ralying two separate towns and convincing them to attack holmgada in the name of the norse gods, but to only capture and not kill people. Sure there were a few deaths during the inital assault, but once it was made clear how outnumbered holmgada was, the christian priesthood agreed to meet the leaders of it.\n\n\nUsual back and forth between NPC's who are basically crazy zealots and the players, who are also crazy zealots, and the loki priest occurred. In the end they agreed to a one on one duel to decide who has rightful sway over holmgada. So the priests pulled a trump card, announcing that their true champion would take some days to arrive, and according to customs they must wait three days for him to arrive. Those three days were really interesting, saw the players constantly trying to keep up moral, so the other two towns didn't leave and ruin the plan, while also making sure the townsfolk of holmgada didn't try anything stupid. I'm honestly kind of amazed they didn't just kill the priests, but these guys were really sticking to the whole norse honour bit.\n\n\nEventually their champion came, a monk in simple robes with long flowing hair and a calm disposition. I made a false jesus, a mad guy who actually thought he was him, but was just a crazy person who seemed perfectly sane and saintly. A quick debate happened between jesus and the loki priest, which i was actually able to do well as i had read a hefty chunk of the bible since then, then the fight.\n\n\nIt was Calder against jesus, which would have been pretty one sided for jesus if it weren't for the fact that the dwarf had been brewing some strength potions out of giants blood and let calder chug one before the fight. Two critical hits in the first round of combat also didn't help matters, with jesus taking enough damage to leave him at about 10 HP, so he tried to invoke the power of the christian god...And when that failed I decided to have a little fun and just have false jesus make a contract with a devil, just to make things even more metal and to make the fight last longer.\n\n\nThey killed devil jesus, and crucified the body before burning the cross, doing the same to his priests just to be safe. The campaign carried on for a long while after, but we shall never forget the day when a viking fought devil jesus in the middle of a blizzard while listening to heavy metal and drinking real mead.",

        "text": "[Previous posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawkinggreentext/comments/81bol7/hungry_are_the_dead_repository/)\n\n--------\n\nTugging at his newly acquired talisman, the mage looked around the ship for a place to write. \n\n*Gods, why did we have to sail there exactly? Couldn’t we have just waited a bit, then teleported? Sure, it’d have cost a bit of coin, but just about anything is safer than sailing, even…….*\n\nFinding a suitable place as any, he continued to write.\n\n-------\n\n###A Month of Reflection and An Escape:\nOur squad was kept of action for about a month, giving some of us time to reflect on all of our actions. In an effort to get to know your mother better, I spent a lot of time with her over the course of the month- by the end of it, we’d grown a fair bit closer. That aside, I decided to spend most of my time crafting various magical items for myself and my squadmates; I was mostly trying to help make sure that nobody else died. I also got a chance to visit Augustus a couple of times while he was in the hole. He wasn’t doing too well, but he still placed an order for a few magical items *A proper waste of time*. Interestingly, a bunch of people kept talking about the public lashing- apparently after some time, he used lay on hands on himself to stop the bleeding as he was whipped, so a bunch of people began to call him “Augustus the Bloodless” *With the benefit of hindsight, “the Spineless” would’ve been far more appropriate*. The most notable event of the month occurred about two or three weeks in; Zemek wasn’t too pleased about his punishment, so he decided to desert. However, he didn’t try to escape the Wastes: he ran *into* the Wastes. I never got the full story, but apparently all of the orcs in his bunk were found on punji sticks and a bunch of equipment (apart from his personal equipment) went missing. Khan was livid at this turn of events, and refused to make any public appearances over the course of the next few days.\n\n###More Recruits and an Undead “Town”:\nAt the end of our “month of shame”, the remaining members of the squad and I were brought before Khan. The captain presented two new recruits: a human Paladin by the name of Stroud, and an aging human cleric by the name of Wednesday. After some introductions, he gave us a simple assignment: to hunt down and retrieve Zemek, dead or alive. Additionally, he offered us a “bonus” if we were to find some scouts that were harassing Forts Pointy and Noose- I’d get out of having to clean the shitpits, Augustus would have his rank reinstated. We were given the usual day of preparation, and were dismissed. During that day, Augustus revealed that Lyrica had visited him in his cell and gave him a wolf, and Khan brought in a giant dinosaur that was meant to help fight the undead *Did he ever manage to tame the beast? I can’t recall*. Can’t remember too much of what else we did to prepare, apart from showing the recruits around the base. We left the next morning, and headed North. On our way, Bler noticed something shiny coming from the mound of sand, so we moved in to investigate- it was a dead body donning a set of armor that had the King’s Seal on it. As it turns, we’d stumbled upon one of the Thousand Blades. After some investigating, we were unable to find his sword, figured out that the Blades were being hunted, and found some tracks leading the Northwest. We decided that figuring out what had managed to kill the warrior was a bit more important than finding Zemek, so we pursued the trail. After a couple of days of travel, we stumbled on a disturbing sight: a series of buildings had been propped up by the undead, and we could all detect a strong aura of evil coming from the area.\n\n###A Beast and an Investigation:\nNot seeing any activity from the outskirts of the “settlement”, Bler downed an invisibility potion amd ran up the “main road”; he reported seeing a bunch of scouts, but not a whole lot else. We started to move in from there, clearing them out room by room. Overall, things seemed to be going quite well, and I figured that we got off easier than if we’d gone after Zemek. However, an undead soldier on a flying mount charged directly at Bler, cutting him up real bad- the potion hadn’t worn off yet, meaning the beast *could see through invisibility.* Now, I’m still not entirely certain what that mount was; it resembled a horse in some respects, a war beast in others, and radiated a strong magical aura. Regardless, Dent and Stroud made it a priority to make it to Bler, leaving the rest of us to mop up the scouts in the main part of the town. We did our job well enough, whereas Dent simply tore through their ranks- their weapons practically had no effect on the monster. After some time, Bler was able to make it to Stroud and healed up. Meanwhile,  the rider, seeing that the scouts were falling, began to retreat; unfortunately for him, Dent was able to pull him off of his mount, prompting a nearby scout to hop on in his place. At first, we tried to prevent the beast from escaping, but after a couple of attempts that failed, we redirected our attention to the rider, figuring that the beast was long gone. However, as soon as the rider was killed, the mount turned back around, dumped the scout from its back, and charged towards us, breathing acid all the while. We all wailed on it for a while, but it wound up being Augustus who killed the mount; he called for his god to help him smite it, and she was apparently listening quite closely to him. *And he was about to ignore her.* With the undead eliminated, we started to look around the town, and were divided into three groups: Augustus and myself, Bler and Dent, and Stroud and Wednesday. He and I wound up investigating a house that was in the Southwest of the settlement. Shortly after we entered, something apparently happened; neither Augustus or I had any recollection of what had happened. However, by the time we were “conscious” again, his curse mark was gone, I’d gotten a curse mark of my own, and he felt a strong evil presence coming from within. ~~Surprisingly, he *wasn’t* simply detecting himse~~\n",

        "text": "Oooohhh boy, so here we go...\n\nI usually run a Dark Heresy game and since one of my players announced to be skippin' some sessions due to real life and because I am a notorious attendance-Hitler, it was decided to  give the scepter of the GM to a buddy for a one shot to bridge the time the other guy needed to get his priorities straight and come back to playing pen and paper games with his nerd friends. Now, we all know and love the All Guardsmen Party and their wackily grimderp misadventures, so in a sprout of inspiration, originality and beer, we decided to also do an All X Party-game.\n\nGM was fine with it and told us to come up with a party. Then he'd then write an adventure for us once he knows what he's working with. As it was a one shot, it was fine if we'd go a bit crazy. Just make something fun, guys!\n\nGM has ridicules working hours, so we had the gaming groups WhatsApp chat for ourselves to bounce ideas back and forth. After four days or so, GM checked to see how we were doing and found what must have been around 30 messages of 0011101011101 011011 1101110001! - 0110001011101 011011 0001110100011 0011011 011111010110? - 011010010001.\n\nHe responded with a simple: \"Oh god no\"\n\n&gt;**The All Techpriest Party and the door control panel schism** \n\nSo, to introduce our band of not-so-merry/slightly-a-whole-lot-batshit-crazy chucklefucks:\n\n*Magos Varovavius Helmuth Ignatio Tesla* - Tesla for short was a techpriest born on one of the Ad Mechs Exploratory fleets and was the muscle to our brain-train. He was geared towards zapping people with his Lumina coils and hated Tau for idiotic ship design. \"Those moronic xenos can't even build a working furnace, no wonder they are not warp-capable!\"\n\n*Magos Mikahil Ulrich* - yours truly and Mike for short. A \"Magos Alchemica\" who found a \"container of flammable liquid of unknown proportions - potentially a revolutionary form of promethium from the Dark Age of Technology. Unfortunately one of my serfs drank I before I could analyze it. He is a servitor now.\" Totally a Russian trying to reinvent vodka. Had a short-lived servitor.\n\n*Magos Alexa Sirissius* - Siri for short. A ultra-hardcore orthodox pray-your-lasrifle-clean magos from a equally insane forgeworld specialized in producing spaceships and weapons of mass destruction. She was so ultra-hardcore in fact, that she was to other techpriests what techpriests usually are to guardsmen.\n\nGM - the unfortunate sod who tried to be nice and got a bag of crazy for his trouble. Ended up having fun too, but started out with a massive headache. But I would have felt the same with a party in which the lowest Intelligence was 52 and the highest Charisma was 25 (of 100 points, roll under system with a human average of like 30-45, for those who don't know Dark Heresy)\n\nSo, to set the stage - and this is the introduction GM used - imagine a sack of cats. Now imagine this sack of cats being violently shook by a big angry Polish man. Now imagine all those angry, confused cats screeching in binary. Welcome to the once-in-a-century 'Congress for the intellectual and technological Advancement of Mankind' in Sibellus, the sector capitol of the Calixis sector on the hive world Scintilla.\n\nSeated in a coliseum-like chamber at the top of one of Sibellus' most prominent spires, over one thousand high ranking Adeptus Mechanicus from the various Cult Mechanicus sects had gathered to ~~discuss the advances in their respective fields in a civil and scientific manner~~ trade accusations of tech-heresy and threats of servitorization under the perpetually rolling eyes of a Tempestus Scions regiment tasked (as a punishment) to make sure this neutral zone stays neutral and no one bombs the heads of Calixis' technological institutions - with force, if need be.\n\nAmidst this chaos, our three Magos Crazycus sat seated in the lower ranks trading their own insults with not-so-esteemed colleagues as a woman in outlandishly fashionably clothing steps into the center of the coliseum and, against the wall of white noise, attempts to introduce herself: She was Elena Helios of the imperial Inquisition, formerly a sister of the Ordo Famulos, tasked by the Emperor and his representatives to attempt a never before act: The genetic reincarnation of the Imperiums greatest minds and heroes. She goes on, unsure whether or not anybody is listening to her, about how she is certain that through the careful manipulation of genealogical lines and genetic code, minds such as Ursarkar E. Creed or legendary warriors such as the fabled son of Rogal Dorn, Sigismund, could be reborn to safeguard each and every world of the Imperium of Man and all this not by heretical and unreliable means of cloning, but through natural births. To make this possible, she had scoured the galaxy for a way to manipulate a fertilized egg in exactly such a way that a genetically identical hero of mankind is reborn. In her search for a way to make this plan reality, she has stumbled upon a device that could potentially do just that, rearrange existing genes to produce a human being with certain desired qualities without resorting to mutation or invasive biotech or cybernetics, using only what is already there. Or, to be more precise, she found a way to make such a device, though she and her associates have not been able to get the production unit working, this 'STC'--\"\n\nHeads snapped towards her, though not the ones she had hoped for, mind you. Not the high and mighty, the accomplished and respected Magi trading insults roughly 500 meters above her, but the dregs of Adeptus Mechanicus society. The Magi who were only invited because, well, their forgeworld/fleet/whatnot used to be kinda important, even though they haven't done anything of note in the past thousand years. Those guys delegated to the lowest ranks, unheard and unseen, forgotten by the actually important people: Us.\n\nWe raised the volume on our voxgrills to screaming-at-servants-levels and declared that of course we would be interested in assisting the Inquisition in this most noble task!\n\nWell, us and all the other nobody-Magos. We saw Elena flinch at the onslaught of artificial voices blaring 'Pick me!' at her. Then we saw techpriests shove each other and start jumping down onto the lower floor and attempting to tackle the poor woman. After all, these were the ignored and forgotten, the Magi who had spent their lives watching servitors build lasrifles 24/7 and they all knew that this was a once in a lifetime chance for them to become a somebody and lift their respective forges from the depth of oblivion. No one would even attempt to be civil about this, only getting that STC mattered.\n\nWe realized the futility of trying to talk this situation through, activated our anti-gravity implants and floated gracefully into the fray (except Mike who failed to hastily activate them properly and dropped into the mass of Mechandrites like a wet sack).\n\nInquisitor Elena in the meanwhile, seeing dozens of red-robed cyborgs storm towards her - cyborgs who she was fairly certain were insane and probably heretics - utterly failed her fear save and became panicked at the sight of a screeching man with two chainsaw arms screaming *\"HERETICS!!!\"* storming towards her. Thus, she did what any human would do in her position: She pulled out her boltpistol and shot the fucker in the face.\n\nWhile this might have deterred more sane people, the desperate techpriests only saw this as one less competitor and redoubled their efforts to get the woman. Tesla was clubbed on the head with a wrench and promptly roasted his attacker. Mike attempted to push through but was punched in the gut by a steel fist and Siri safely landed next to Elena.\n\n*\"Come with me if you want to live, fleshsack.\"*, she offered in her voxgrills most soothing mode and extended a hand. Whether it was the voice or the fact that Sire as a fellow female and seemed more familiar to the sister, we do not know. What we do know is, that she grabbed hold of Siri just as the perpetually-eyerolling Tempestus Scions dropped into the fray and started kicking the emperorloving fuck out of the brawling techpriests. \n\nSeeing the inquisitor float away with another techpriests, Tesla and Mike reactivated their floaters and followed suit, expertly avoiding getting their faces kicked in by annoyed and frustrated soldiers. Siri was not amused that there were still competitors for 'her STC' and Elena was again trying to explain that this was actually all about making an army of supergenerals in order to ensure humanities survival, but after the assurance from Tesla and Mike that they were probably 'not half of crazy as the rest of your potential future allies', the concession that Siri would be named first when the STC is presented and the royalties are reaped as well Mikes Servitor heroically sacrificing himself to block a door from the other techpriests that managed to follow us up from the pit, a bond between us three and a verbal non-backstabbing agreement was made while we fled the spire towards the waiting Ordo Famulus shuttle.\n\nNow, one might expect this shuttle to be taking us to some hush, hush inquisition cruiser, packed to the brim with arcane secrets, borderline heretical (and super interesting) tech and a crew of hardened secret agent types. This, however, was not the case: Instead of stepping onto a pleasure yacht of unsupervised tinkering, we found ourselves on a vessel run by the Adeptus Sororitas' Ordo Famulus. Angelic voices singing praise to the Emperor of Mankind and the smell of non-machine-oil-dosed incense assaulted our senses and we were greeted by a sight of countless holy machines adorned only with the bare minimum of propper sanctifications. Sure, almost the entire vessel was covered in Ecclesiarchy-typical symbolism and while it was commendable that the meatbags gave praise to the Omnisdiah-made-flesh, their way of worshipping was simply... wrong.\n\nHowever, knowing the illogical ways of the overly emotional meatbags who simply could not take constructive criticism without flying into a planet-sterilizing temper tantrum, we decided to first gain the sisters adoration through stunning displays of our superior intellect before subtly starting to correct their fallacies and minor heresies. After all, is it not ignorance of the Omnissiahs true form that has them make these mistakes? Surely we should act as benevolent teachers to these stupid meatbags.\n\nAt any rate, the fist thing we had to endure was a tour of the ship, done by some soft spoken serving wench named Piotess Sevenia or something and a retinue of a few dozen singing sisters. As she was clearly unimportant in the local command structure, we opted to subtly speak to each other in binary, discussing our plans and occasionally mocking the way the woman moved as clearly her prosthetic legs were sub par. We decided that the resident techpriests should most definitely be turned into servitors for their gross neglect of the local machine spirits, though our inquiries as to where we could find them yielded no satisfying answer.\n\nIt took us at least two (wasted) hours until the sisters finally led us into their chapel, where they  introduced us to the patron saint of their order, some woman that birthed a lot of children from select mates. The sisters were very impressed with her and in a moment of silent waiting after their account of the woman's offspring came to an end, Siri asked them:\n\n*\"So has this woman done anything important, or was her having many different males breed her the entirety of her lifes accomplishments?\"*\n\nThe sisters jaws dropped and their faces went red. Mike and Tesla helpfully offered to replace their ineffective mouth-pieces with voxgrills same as we had - surely they could make some from spare pieces on board - in order to prevent such embarrassing malfunctions in the future. Unfortunately, the sisters were apparently quite fond of their fleshy bits and intellectually incapable of recognizing a voxgrills advantages. It took Elena several hours of soothing talk to get Pritoness and her friends to calm down and we were finally were brought to the machine deck. Sadly, the STC was not on board and was being kept at an 'undisclosed location'. It took Mike 17,68 seconds to find the information in the vessels databases: We were to travel to the contested world of *Bennards Hope*, where the meatbags had apparently found the device and wisely decided that they were not qualified to manipulate it.\n\nAnd with that began a very long and very awkward journey through the immaterium...\n\nAs we already blatantly stole the AGPs campaign concept, I'm going to also blatantly steal their way of storytelling and end this on a cliffhanger. Part II of the All Techpriest Party will follow soon, don't want to make the post to long...",

        "text": "This was a small game I ran, lasting exactly one session, mainly because one of the most important people in the game, one of the player characters, was turned into a vegetable within the third round of the very first combat.\n\nThe set up was pretty simple, a smuggler was on alderan to pick up an important member of the rebellion, one of the last remaining  Miraluka \\(a race of blind humanoids, all of whom are force sensitive\\), who also carried an encoded holocron which contained a star map to some of the emperors secret bunkers. Meanwhile, an ewok was trapped inside a cage that was within the space port because he had somehow made his way there, suffice to say he was being played by a \"that guy\" and made an ewok who could basically fly anything...despite their race not actually being able to use tech of any kind, but due to technicalities it was ok. I told him not to but he did it already, and i just wanted to get on with the session.\n\nthe two normal characters met in a bar, and when i say normal, the smuggler had assembled a rotating chair there and had taken his cat called dog with him so he could turn around like doctor evil and say \"i've been expecting you\". This guy used to be a \"that guy\", but the character he made was actually normally balanced and everything, just fucking quirky. Him and the miraluka roleplayed a bit, discussing the payment, which the miraluka was able to hand over the first half of before they made their way to the space port. Some troopers were blocking the entrance to everyone, including a man on a stretcher and some medical staff who had scheduled to take the man off planet...the troopers shot him and then threatened to do the same to the doctors. So, casually, the smuggler walked up to the troopers and unloaded his pistol into one of their foreheads.\n\nAAAAAANNNNNDDDDD this is where things get weird. You see, the WEG star wars system had weird combat rules, it had weird stat rules in general. But suffice to say it was a D6 based system. When you needed to make a roll, you took the number of dice equal to your base stat, then you take the same number of dice as you have in a specific skill, then you divide them up between how many actions you wish to take. So lets say you have a total of ten dice for blaster pistols, you could take ten attacks, but you're basically not going to hit, especially not against stormtroopers. Because whenever an attack roll is made, your target rolls to see if they dodge it, and even if they hit, they roll again to see if they even take damage from the hit in the first place. This creates a situation where it is actually entirely possible for a person, who is armoured enough, to take a direct blast from the death star, survive, and then take their own attack against it and destroy it with a throwing knife. Wookies were insane in this game because they couldn't dodge for shit, but they could soak up damage like a sponge.\n\nBut it gets worse, you see, you don't have health, there is a damage table though. If you get hit, and take damage from the attack, you compare the difference between your defensive role, and the opponents attack role, the end number is then checked on the table, and anything above a 3 is basically ensured death, just varying degrees of it.\n\nSuffice to say, the smuggler killed the trooper, but the troopers swiss cheesed him. I then did a rewind because neither of us were expecting it to be that lethal, as he died to the second shot. So after that the two of them snuck into the space port to get to the smugglers ship, which they were able to pull off rather successfully, dropping down inside a hallway before heading on, but a few failed sneaking rolls later and they had more troopers on them, just two though, and the players were smart enough to duck inside a side room and wait for the enemies to come in. One of the troopers died when the miraluka deployed his saber through the guys skull, but the second trooper, he dodged all of their attacks like neo from the matrix, and shot at the miraluka.\n\nNow lets talk about how crits work. You designate a single dice you intend to use as your crit dice, if you roll a six, you roll it again, and you can potentially do this infinitely, this is why it's possible to kill the death star with a throwing knife. The trooper got his crit dice to get a 6, 3 times. The attack was basically strong enough to nearly insta gib the miraluka, who got a damage number that meant without extreme medical attention, he'd die within the next minute. The smuggler killed the trooper, got some mass effect style medi\\-gel from a container, shoved it into the new neck hole the miraluka had, stuck him onto a wheelchair and proceeded to escort him towards his ship slowly, all while duel wielding stormtrooper blasters. He wasn't that skilled with them, but he didn't use them for combat, just tap to the back of the head insta kill shots.\n\nMeanwhile, the ewok had been fucking about the space port and had eventually found his way to the smugglers ship where he proceeded to kill some dudes with a forklift, then get high of some drugs he found inside the smugglers crates that needed to be loaded on. The smuggler, to his credit, was pretty fucking smart in how he got the miraluka to the starship, slowly wheeling him along, killing anyone before they noticed he was even there, and telling me that he is going slowly on purpose to minimize sound, which saw me fudging the rules and giving him extra dice to sneak about easily. Eventually they got to the ship just as the troopers started to notice things were going wrong, they then took off just in time to watch alderan be destroyed behind them.\n\nWe didn't continue the game after that, because the miraluka was basically dead, the ewok was useless in every regard, and the smuggler had just lost his meal ticket. I only use the WEG books for fluff now, too lethal for me.",

        "text": "This is the story of my greatest final boss out of all the campaigns I ran, and it was also the destruction of a campaign world I had been working on for a long time, but boy was it worth it.\n\nThe campaign was mainly focused on corrupt politics, with the party joining the rebellion against the corrupt officials, get the prince away from his corrupt vizier and try to improve the kingdom as a whole in the process. Enter Brice brandybuck, a human bard who worked as a tax collector for the capital, he was engaged to a higher official in the law and order departments, she was in charge of the prisons mostly, and one of the few none corrupt members of state. They had a child out of wedlock as well, cute little girl who lived with her mother mostly, but as Brice was looking to move up in the world, he'd soon be able to see her much more. He was first encountered by the players when they mugged him, but left him alive, if only barely. They did this because he had taken taxes from a local baker who could barely afford to pay, and the baker had sheltered them the night prior. After this, they encountered him again when they struck the local bank in order to acquire funds to pay for mercs, so that the rebellion could use them as a distraction for another plan. Again they nearly killed him, but they spared him after he was the last guy in combat, the reason why they let him live? He yelled \"please, not like this, if I'm going to die, I want to see my wife's face one last time...\" So they knocked him out, robbed the bank, and fled.\n\nAfter this, he was promoted for giving perfect descriptions of the player characters and even finding some of their stuff after the bank raid with which to magically track them \\(empty magic potion flasks.\\). He was moved to the upper district where the party eventually found their way to, as the rebellion was making progress and they had started to shift from building the rebellion to preparing for it, namely by killing off officials or otherwise getting rid of any other potential problems like sewer monsters. They encountered him for the third time at a nobles house, because he, along with a few other spellcasters, had secretly gathered together in order to try and figure out the location of artifacts. The players hit the place, took all of their findings, and again left brice alive, because they needed someone to bully into revealing the location of some item they were looking for...they then took him along as a captive, tossed him to the rebellion, and moved on to their next target...The high warden, his wife.\n\nThey killed her quick enough, looted her body and took the magical keys she had, which they then used to cause riots in the prison they were in, before giving the keys over to the rebellion to repeat the process and free their captive members. The riots were chaotic, they rampaged throughout the local area and the players decided to make use of the chaos and do a little looting, even burned down a manor house near the main prison for shits and giggles. Meanwhile they pawned off alot of the loot they found on the womens body, including a seemingly low quality wedding ring that they didn't even bother to check the inside of. Brice didn't find out for a month or so as the party spent their time hunting down the desired artifact that they had been sent to collect information on earlier.\n\nIt's important to note that three of the other characters did have love lives. One of them was getting into a relationship with the head of the spy network, another started the game with a wife and kids, and a third had a sister who had been sold into slavery but found her some time ago during the campaign. They didn't think much of the sudden disappearance of brice, no one really did, he was just a bard, a low rank magister within the court who used to be a tax collector. \n\nEventually the rebellion started...but it was much messier than expected, because brice had given detailed reports to the vizier about the plan, only after relaying everything he knew, was he told about the death of his wife...and the death of his daughter, she had been burned alive in a fire at the manor house. The players didn't know this latter bit of course, why would they? They hadn't tried to talk to the head warden, they had burst in and ignored her attempts to deal with things peacefully, ignoring everything in her desk that wasn't valuable in terms of wealth or information, including the picture of three people that had a prominent spot on it.\n\nDuring the final few sessions of the encounter, the players spent most of their time going kill crazy, wading their way through bodies until they got to the castle, secured the princes safety and made one last push to find the vizier. He was down in the vault, staring in horror at an empty pedestal. What was supposed to be the end of it all turned into a conversation between them and the most corrupt man of state. The empire had been hunting for more than one artifact after all, and the prize of that collection, which the party had known about, was the bottle of 666 djinn, a bottle which could potentially grant 666 wishes if its wielder could compel each and every djinn in turn to grant one. It was missing, their only clue was the vizier babbling about a man with a broken sword which had the phrase \"fear the fool\" on it. The players knew only one person with a sword like that.\n\nThey scryed for him, and they found him at a graveyard within the city, sitting in front of two marked graves, with five fresh, unmarked ones beside it. He scared the shit out of them when he grabbed the sphere that mages see through when casting a scry spell and told them a few things. Firstly, that they had taken everything from him, but not stating what exactly. secondly, he wanted them to come to him, and if they didn't, he'd open the bottle and begin making wishes, waiting for one hour before making a single wish every minute. and thirdly, to come alone, or else he'd smash the bottle and release all 666 djinn. \n\nThey arrived as a thick storm rolled in, the capital was ablaze in front of them, roaring with the fires of rebellion. Brice was sitting there, watching it flicker, the seal of the bottle already removed, with the only thing keeping the army from flowing out being his thumb, an impromptu deadmans switch. At first they went there to try and get him to calm down, maybe switch sides and join the rebellion, but he shut them up with the first sentence \"why did you spare me if you were just going to kill my wife and child?\" The rant he went on wasn't something any of the characters, or players, expected. mocking their love of bloodshed, lack of tact, and so on so forth. In the end he gestured to the other graves, \"you took everything from me, my home, my future, my family. At least I was able to repay the favor a little, you'd be amazed what a madness spell does when combined with a wand of permanency, may they be screaming even beyond the grave. But I'm not done yet, this wont be finished until you're with them, and for that, I'm going to need a bit of an edge.\" Then he chugged the bottle, downed it in one go.\n\nI should have rolled 666 separate possession roles to see if he'd be fine, but his passive will save was so high because of some of the gear he had on, I only really needed to roll once, for the strongest djinn inside of the bottle. I gave my players a single choice, who rolled the final dice to decide what they'd face up on that hill. They said I should, but they wanted to see the roll happen...You've never seen a group of players look so disappointed at seeing a nat 20 before.\n\nHe remained largely the same, except going all dragon ball, with a glowing aura, flowing coloured hair and a shirt that got shredded after he flexed. His broken sword which he carried everywhere, which was meant to be a symbol of why he hates fighting and prefers to use words, got repaired, the broken bastard sword now restored, with the full phrase showing \"fear the fool, for he knows not it's meaning.\"\n\nThe stat card I had prepared for this was some of my cruelest work yet, a gestalt character with legendary actions, some nasty homebrew abilities and three uses of the wish spell. He dropped the fighter four times during that fight, the cleric only barely able to keep him alive until he was wished into the core of the planet and died instantly. the other two wishes were counterspelled, but he didn't need them as he killed pretty much everybody, with the final party member being the gnome wizard. This guy was a batman wizard, he planned for all outcomes, which is why he spent most of his free time crafting necklaces of fireballs, before stuffing them into a bag of holding. His last action? turning the bag inside out and set them all off with a firebolt spell. Brice was already down to 20 HP left by the end, but that big boom was definitely a great way to go out.\n\nThe blast basically acted as a nuke, destroying a massive portion of the countryside and smashing down some of the city in the process, the djinn were released from their enslavement at last and caused even more destruction across the planet. They could have been contained, if it weren't for the fact that the current rebellion effectively crippled any chance of a proper retaliation in time before it was too late. In the end, the djinn nearly destroyed the entire planet, with other nations leaving the world entirely.\n\nAnd that, is why revenge is a dish best served hot.",

Maybe I’ll buy that talisman that some of the guys back on base were talking about- that should help……..*\n\n-------\n\n###A New Recruit, A New Mission:\nAt the end of our week, Khan summoned all of us once again. After saying Augustus was cleared to go on missions, he introduced us to a halfling cleric of ~~For~~ *Gods, have to be careful- don’t want the letter to burn on me* the Sun God by the name of Isen- he was a new recruit, and was to accompany us on future missions. The captain then mentioned that our report of the previous expedition indicated a need for proper leadership, so, for whatever reason, he put me in charge of our upcoming mission. After a bit of initial confusion at his decision, he put Zemek in charge of defending Isen, and Augustus/Dent were made co-second in commands. With a chain of command established, he gave us our next assignment: deal with a group of scouts that had been seen around “Fort Noose” (the fort we had retaken, which was named by the men stationed there). Given 24 hours to prepare, we started to show Isen around the base, but Zemek took the opportunity to force feed him orcish cuisine at the mess hall in order to “help him grow”- he and Cookie believed him to be a malnourished child (Dent brought an end to it by casting a spell that enlarged the halfling, which appease the two orcs). In spite of this, Augustus was able to make quick friends with the cleric, given their similar outlooks on life and general desire to do good. After a while, I walked off to check on your mother. In my absence, apparently the others had a wrestling competition of the sorts, with no clear victor emerging from it. We set out the next day, and a single scout that attempted to conceal itself aside, we didn’t have any real problems. Within a few days, we arrived at “Fort Pointy” (the pyramid we had recaptured was turned into an outpost apparently, and was also named by the men stationed there).\n\n###The Death of a Recruit, Chaos:\nUpon our arrival, we were screened by the men stationed there to ensure that none of us were undead. After telling them about our expedition, I had to fill out a few forms detailing our travels thus far. Once I was done, we traded them a few luxuries from our morale rations (when I offered socks, I actually had to keep them from swarming me), and departed not long after. A few hours into our journey towards Fort Noose, we came under attack from two groups undead scouts and skeletal champions that descended from undead eagles. In order to cope with this, I split the squad into two- with the benefit of hindsight, I should’ve kept the squad together and dealt with the groups individually. While our initial fight appeared to go well enough, Zemek had his kills stolen from him over the course of the battle by Isen and Bler, which annoyed him a fair bit. I wound up breaking my own orders to help Augustus, who had been tripped and left vulnerable by one of the scouts. By doing so, I left Isen to contend with a scout, believing he could handle it- he got cut in half by a scythe. While we were able to defeat the rest of the scouts, Augustus blamed me for Isen’s death, so he wound up hitting me in the face before berating me for poor leadership skills. Zemek, still fuming from failing in his task to defend Isen and the stolen kills, witnessed this, and proceeded to wail on the Paladin with the blunt end of his sword. I tried calling him off, but he wound up chasing Bler and Dent instead, hoping to extract revenge for the stolen kills. After explicitly ordering him to stop hitting the other party members, he directed his attention to the squad’s pony, Glitterhoof- all I’ll say of that is that the poor pony never stood a chance. All the while, Augustus continued to berate me for my poor decisions as a leader, before deciding to take Isen’s body to be buried. Feeling guilty about the whole affair, I offered to help ensure that the burial was carried out properly- before my conversion to Dracorex, I’d been one of ~~Fortisi~~ the Sun God’s followers. *That was way too close.* However, I was continuously rebuffed by Augustus, who claimed I just wanted to burn the body for my own pleasure. Before he could attempt it however, Bler, no longer being pursued by Zemek, was able to subdue the orc and the Paladin by using a concoction that was meant to calm down our horses. Deciding our mission was no longer feasible, we rode back to Fort Pointy. Informing them of what had happened, we were all disarmed, and were escorted back to Fort Deathwatch.\n\n###A Public Trial:\n\nSaying Khan wasn’t pleased about the results of our mission is a bit of an understatement. He lined all of us up on a podium (with Augustus and Zemek in chains) and posted crossbowmen in a firing line, each of them having their weapons drawn. I remember seeing your mother in the crowd, crying- both of us were convinced that I was going to die then and there. Khan walked by us, expressing his disappointment in our performance, said something about how it reflected poorly on the unit. He then began outlining the charges against us, one by one. Augustus was first: after having Bler state what had happened, he asked each of us if the Paladin has stricken me, and everybody replied affirmatively. When it came to my turn to confirm Bler’s report, for some reason, I felt compelled to cover for the Paladin, and tried to claim that Augustus hadn’t deliberately hit me. *Honestly, why did I defend him? He punched me in the face and claimed I was trying to get a laugh out of burning Isen. Then there’s how he-*  The captain wasn’t convinced, and dealt out the Aasimar’s punishment: Eirika would be transferred to another unit (with the two being disallowed to contact each other), he would be placed into solitary confinement (only being allowed to talk with the men who brought him food), and would be stripped of all rank. For poor leadership, Khan expressed personal disappointment in me, and I was demoted to private and forced to clean the shitpits for two months; however, he commended me for attempting to stick up for Augustus, even if he had hit me. He then attempted to lay out Zemek’s charges, but Augustus kept talking over him, sputtering out that he didn’t regret his actions- as such, he tied the Paladin to a post and called Eirika up, and ordered her to administer him lashings. While this happened, he simply told Zemek that he was transferred to the Orcish bunks, being forced to clean them. After being told he would have to report to the captain nightly, we were all dismissed. I talked to Khan about Augustus’ punishment, asking whether all of it was necessary. He gave a simple explanation that made a surprising amount of sense, and I was dismissed. From there, I realized it was probably a good idea to check on your mother. She was still crying because of what had happened. I immediately started to feel guilty for what I had put her through. Now, while I hate to admit this, my decision to marry and have a child with your mother was largely motivated by a fear of death as opposed to, well, love. However, I felt a sense of genuine concern for her as we were comforting each other, and, realizing I had wronged her, I resolved to be a better partner. A day or two later, I was the first one to bring Augustus food, so he and I had a brief talk; we decided to let the incident be water under the bridge, and after he turned down my offer for companionship, I departed.\n",

        "text": "There is a theory in fiction called the batman hole, where every character eventually becomes batman to varying degrees, whether this is with dead parents and lots of money, a bunch of gadgets, or brooding too much. I used to have a similar problem in my group, I called it the monk hole.\n\nEvery player showed up one night for the session zero, they wanted to do something crazy and bizzare for the campaign, so I got to planning. When planning a campaign i like to do it during the session zero while the players make and discuss their characters in front of me, so they can get to work, ask questions to me now and then, and hand over what is done for final approval.\n\nThere was an abnormal amount of grunting that night, as they slowly came up with the insane idea to make a whole team of non\\-monk monks. Each character was a different class, but they all used their fists. We had:\n\nCannonball: The halfing brawler\n\nrandy flair: The human magus, AKA the fist sorcerer \n\nThe tombstone: The changeling rogue\n\nThe cliff: The brown skinned full blood orc barbarian\n\nThey had all taken the same teamwork feats, and after the game started, they trained in their spare time to learn how to use more teamwork feats. I was also kind enough to ignore some of those feats entirely and just let them do it without them. \n\nIn the end, we had a squad of sweaty, poor men who all had, at minimum, 18 strength. The end result was a true test of combat encounter planning on my end, because with the way the party was built, they could instantly murder single targets by tag teaming them and beating them into the ground, so i had to throw massive sacks of hitpoints at them, or many smaller enemies, anything inbetween just got reduced to a bloody pulp.\n\nThe best example of this was when I foolishly thought that by throwing some men in heavy plate armour at them, they'd have a tough time cracking the shell. Instead, they killed them by grappling, pinning, then choking. We rolled for several rounds, but in the end the dudes in armour were all choked to death without even causing a single point of damage to the party. \n\nIt was made even worse when the sorcerer enchanted a purposefully cursed item. It was called the ring of the swole, it cursed the wearer to increase by one size catagory permanently until the ring was removed, they gave this to the orc. So now, whenever they fought a giant, he'd pin and choke it while everyone else whaled on it, which was overkill, because at that point they had developed a foolproof method of dropping giants by using bullrush attacks and delayed strikes to knock their feet out from under them and lay them prone.\n\nThere were several great stories from this campaign, but the best by far is how they proved the superiority of western wrestling over eastern martial arts. Up until then, the party had been wrestling for sport, honing their skills as they passed through the land, but after cannonball nearly got assassinated by a halfling whore, the fist sorcerer flexed at her, cast charm person, and charmed her into telling them who sent her. \n\nWord of their exploits had begun to reach far and wide, even to the mountain martial arts school of the Kokuren \\(black lotus for you none japanese speakers.\\). The campaign world as a whole was built upon martial arts, with wars long ago being abandoned for conflict being decided by martial arts masters, even the fates of nations. But these fights were always done by one on one fights, never teams. Thus, this group of sweaty men were seen as a threat by the government, for using the power of friendship.\n\nSo, they banded together and decided to wreck house, climbing the mountain and knocking out everyone in the kokuren school. They purposefully tried not to kill anyone, including the grandmaster who nearly threw one of them off the mountain. Instead, they tied them all up, set them in the main hall, and forced them, one by one, to say that, and i quote \"friendship is magic, sweat will set you free, embrace your fellow man in conflict and in peace.\" They then took over the school and turned it into a school of wrestling, with the previous grandmaster having to submit because he lost to them in an official fight. They turned an ancient dojo into a WWE wrestling ring and proceeded to slowly spread their ideology...which resulted in the return of mass warfare. ",

        "text": "This story comes from a forum RP I was involved in about 3-4 years ago. I'll get around to posting the entire thing at some point, but this story takes place at the end. I'll try to type it from 3rd person, but please let me know if I did a poor job explaining anything\n \nOf the starting party of a dozen (with a lot of revolving door party members as well) there were 4 left as we approached the Demon King's lair. These were:\n \n**Jessica**: Mix Saber from Fate, Toph from A:TLA, Daredevil from Marvel, and Meliodas from Seven Deadly Sins, and you have a good approximation of Jessica. She was blind but could hear really well, and her sword let her absorb any attack and then hit for twice that energy. She was pretty much the main character.\n \n**Marcus**: An angel with all the standard angel powers (Wings, holy fire, etc.). came in about 1/3 through and stuck it out till the end. He had a lot of backstory about him being on a quest to get the macguffin so no mortal could get it first or something, but a lot of it got lost just by nature of text-based forums\n \n**Lisette**: A witch/druid. Her whole deal was she had this darker, primal part to her and that could manifest as great powers like shapeshifting. She also came from a remote village of witches and so was very fish-out-of-water. She was awesome, and I loved her character and interactions with the rest of the party\n \n**Ravin**: Me! Ravin was made out of living metal, could turn his hands into swords, and eat just about anything. I would give you a backstory, but I flipflopped on it so many times that he became a mess where he was Razer from DotA, then he was actually a vessel for a long dead blacksmith, then he wanted to be a Don Quixote type hero, then he wanted to be the sun? It was weird.\n \nSo it had come down to the four of them, approaching the Demon King's fortress, where the Angel Rae'Ala was held captive. As they reached the gates, they heard noises from behind them. Turning around, a horde of minor demons had cut off the retreat, and now there were two options: Fight or Enter. \n\n\"GO!\" Marcus yelled, \"I Shall hold them off!\"\n\nUnfortunately, the door was locked, and only a single key could open it. Ravin reached into his pockets and pulled a bronze key, which was won after defeating a beast at the cost of his best friend. Entering the key into the lock, the doors opened, allowing Jessica, Lisette, and Ravin to enter, while Marcus stayed outside to face the army. \n \nInside this first chamber, there was nothing but blackness. Ravin and Lisette inched forward slowly, before a beast spilled forth from the darkness. Lisette knew it at once, it was her own dark side made manifest, and she knew she would fight this battle alone. Sending  Ravin forward, she and her evil counterpart clashed.\n \nJessica had not followed them. By some demonic magic, she was transported into the throne room of the Demon King himself, flanked on one side by Tibalt, the demon who killed her family, and to the other stood the reanimated corpses of her brother and Gabriel, the man she loved. In the back of the room was a golden cage, inside laid Rae'Ala, weakened. With a scream of defiance, Jessica charged forward, aiming to avenge her loved ones, no matter the cost\n \n Ravin reached the end of the room, the sounds of battle still roaring behind them, when they found another door, locked with a silver lock. Ravin searched through his pockets, yet could find no silver key. Ravin wracked his brain, trying to remember where this key could be, and he remembered; on the body of a fallen comrade, a days walk away. Hope seemed lost. That is until Samson, his dear friend's fox familiar, appeared, with the silver key in his mouth (AKA we realized there was no way Ravin ever picked up the key so we had to BS it so the story could continue).\n \nJess managed to kill her brother, releasing him from his torment, and they shared on last heartfelt goodbye. In the midst of the fighting, as well, she saw that Gabriel was not truly gone, and was fighting back against his possession. Desperately she tried to wake him up, but the magic was insidious, and kept its hold. Ravin found himself in the throne room, watching a fight far out of his league. This fight came all too close when Gabriel charged him, intending to skewer him. With a sidestep, Ravin severed not only Gabriel's arm, but the magic binding his soul. One last passionate kiss from Jess reminded him of who he was, and he awoke from his possession, alive, and in the arms of his love. Now, Jess focused on Tibalt, and their fight turned one sided, as all of Tibalt's advantages lay in the numerical superiority. \n \nMarcus, still outside, fought hard against the oncoming hordes. There seemed to be no end, and yet he continued unabated. Holy fire surged from his body and he brandished his blade against the forces of hell. Waves upon waves fell, but still more surged on. He could only hope that his allies within were close to ending this blight on the world.\n \nLisette and her double fought, yet neither gained a true advantage. When one would shapeshift, the other would react. This dance went on for what seemed like ages. The mirror was not getting tired, but Lisette well and truly was. Her body was beaten and bloody, and she doubted if she could last much longer. With her mirror self standing on top, her foot crushing Lisette's windpipe, Lisette gave one last surge of effort, transforming into a bear and hitting her double square in the chest. This brief respite was all she needed, as the next moment was defined by blood and screams as Lisette pounced and mauled her dark side to death.\n \nWith Tibalt and Jessica fighting, and the Demon King preoccupied watching the battle, Ravin snuck to the golden cage, where he produced the third and final key needed. With Rae'Ala free, the Demon King clashed ferociously, but was no match. Banishing both Tibalt and the Demon King back to the depths of hell, the world grew silent. \n \nOutside, the legion of demons found themselves without a master and fled or were cut down. With Rae'Ala returned, the world returned to how it was, and all ended well for the surviving heroes.\n \n************************************************************************************************************\n \n \nSo that was the story. Probably a bit confusing since I started at the end, but it's interesting that this started out as me wanting to say \"During the last bit all I did was find some keys\" but it was a nice trip down memory lane. I definitely need to get the entire thing out one day, but this was just the biggest story that came to mind",

        "text": "This was set in a custom campaign world, with the general idea being that the old world was ruined (it was in another campaign), and the governments of the world decided to settle a new one. Enlisting the help of heroes, adventurers and sellswords. They sent them through a portal to this new land and gave them one general goal: Clear the way and set up basic defences.\n\nSkipping over about two months of play, and the party is living in a fancy house built by their mage using lots of magic in his free time. They were approached by another arcane user who belonged to a school of magic, called viscromancy (flesh magic). He asked them to bring live bodies of animals to his lab so he could study them and make a bestiary out of his discoveries for everyone to make use of. The pay was good, and they didn't want to do anything massive because they wanted to help build up the current frontier town.\n\nThey went off into the wilderness and, through great difficulty, captured a Chimera. But then the mage had an idea, he cast suggestion on it, and asked it about it's children, turned out the Chimera had two kittens, newborn and barely able to open their eyes. They took the Chimera back to town, sold her for a hefty price to the viscromancer, and then went to get the babies, which proved to be much quicker, and far more profitable because he could study their life cycle.\n\nThey gave up on catching the bigger monsters after that, employing gurrilla tactics to lure out the parents before sending in the rogue, armed with chloroform, to knock out and capture the babies in a burlap sack. They did this, for nearly every animal, in the surrounding area of the frontier town. \n\nBy the time the next major part of the campaign started up (there were people on the planet already, lizard folk), they didn't really stop. They stealthed into one of their towns, and even though they were there for info, they still stole about ten already hatched baby lizardfolk. Tossing them all into a big sack and running off into the night like krampus at christmas.\n\nThis reached critical mass when they had to find a way to stop a dragon, who was the ruler of the region the frontier town was in, from destroying everything. I thought they might try to bargain with it or play politics and get another dragon to attack it or even be foolish and try to kill it on their own (which they could have done, as it was only two CR above their group level), but no, they pulled off the most amazing baby theft yet.\n\nUsing a bag of holding, the wizards familiar, and flasks of air, they snuck past all the traps, guards and hazards with pretty much no issue. Having piled into the bag and let the familiar carry it along, as it was a pesudo-dragon. Three nat 20's in a row will do that.\n\nThey stole all of the dragons eggs and left using lots of stoneshape spells, carving their way through the wall of the cavern and out into the wilderness. They then sold one of the eggs to the viscromancer, kept the rest, and used one of them as a hostage to keep the dragon at bay. \n\nEven after they found out what the viscromancer had been doing with all these babies, which mainly involved \"experimenting\" (I refuse to go into detail), they still kept selling him infants and made a massive profit, it was at this point I changed most of their alignments one step towards evil.\n\nThe moral of the story? Don't expect your players to have morals. Even when you try to get them to stop selling babies to a creepy man, they'll still do it if there is money to be made.",

        "text": "In the port city of magnimar, there is a large sewer system that most buildings connect to, filled with all kinds of muck and nastiness. The party was hired by a wealthy alchemist to go down into the cities bowls and clear out some seamen that had been causing trouble above ground for certain establishments.\n\nThey waded their way through, complaining about how shit the job was, killing various sewer monsters for shit and gore covered loot until they arrived at the marked out section. Up until then they had been killing standard sewer fodder, bugs, rats, the odd shit zombie and even a gator, but nothing in their entire adventuring career could have prepared them for the next encounter.\n\nThey began to wade through some thick, creamy substance in the water while making their way underneath a building near the alchemists home, hunting for the seamen who were attacking the people above. One round later, they found out they weren't fighting seaman, but living semen. One of them was nearly drowned and choked to death when it used it's swallow attack, another was assaulted at both ends when they used their spurt movement ability. The wizard activated his wild magic on accident and nearly caused a 9th level meteor spell if it had been one percentage higher, but instead cast a spell of the DM's choosing...He used ball of UV light, illuminating the entire tunnel in deep purple light that shone neon yellow off of everything.\n\nThe fight was long, hard, and messy, but they managed to win in the end, with only one of them having been knocked unconscious from swallowing too much. When they got back to the alchemist, they were rightly pissed and threatened to kill him if he didn't explain the situation.\n\nTurned out that the building next to his was a brothel, and he had been hired to use his alchemical skills to help clean the place up after a rather busy night. It half worked, the brothel was clean, but all the chemicals and magic he had used had slipped down the grates into the sewer, reanimating the semen.\n\nAfter this, the party took their money, forced him to clean them off as best he could, got them a membership to the brothel (which they never used) and an extra magic item. \n\nTo this day, we still remember the messy affair that surrounded them acquiring a rod of wonder.

        "text": "&gt; After gaining the safety of the Greenest Keep, Rickart, Alice and Nez meet the castellan of the Keep, offering their services and information.  Ricart is taken to the governor, while Nez recovers from his injuries, and Alice scopes the terrain.\n\n&gt; Rickart presents his map to the governor, but their worries are more immediate - the town has been taken by the enemy, and the keep is circled by a dragon (thankfully keeping its distance for now).  Rickart is offered a mission to assist - his band is to use a hidden tunnel to reach the church, where they are to disrupt the enemy to cover an assault by the soldiers of the keep, and possibly return some supplies from the church's stores.\n\nWe spent a fair amount of time RP'in this encounter, learning details of troop movements and enemy concentrations. Interesting at the time, but not very exciting to read about. :D\n\n&gt; Alice, after poking around the armoury, heads to the plank laid over some saw horses that does the job of a bar, and drops some gold to buy drinks for everyone.  She spends some time trying to learn more about the Cult of the Dragon, but comes up empty. She scouts the camp further, hoping to turn up something.\n\n&gt; Nez, after some rest, heads to higher ground to see if he can get more intelligence on the dragon.  He scans the skies, and sees the blue scales of the dragon, so close in hue to his own.  He quickly descends into a depressive funk, and heads to the bar to drink his troubles away.\n\nWe spent some time trying to get more information from this camp, but it all boiled down to \"Nothing to see here.\"\n\n&gt; Rickart follows the castellan and the governor out to the courtyard, extolling the virtues of his colleagues... as they see the dragonborn slumped over the bar, flagon of ale in hand, weeping openly.  Alice meets them all and they discuss the planned offensive.  Alice and the castellan immediately grate on one another, but after some... discussion... (and, of course, sobering up the dragonborn) the plan is agreed and the group go to the tunnel entrance, promising to provide top-notch adventuring services.\n\nAlice argued with the castellan for a while about how she could use his troop movements to assist us, when he clearly saw our mission as unrelated to his.  She and the DM leaned into it, and it made some good RP.\n\n&gt; Hunched over in darkness, the party makes their way through the darkness, concentrating on their stealth, so as not to reveal the location of the secret tunnel to any errant observers. Suddenly, a scrabbling noise - rats!\n\nRats?  No problem.  Easier than kobolds, amiraite?\n\n&gt; Rickart slashes at some of the rodents, skewering them on his rapier. Nez aims an eldritch blast, but they skitter past it... right up his legs! Suddenly, he is covered in furry needles, biting &amp; scratching.. until he collapses.\n\n&gt; Desperate to help, Alice and Rickart try to lend aid, but are unable to do so and hold off the rat swarm.  They finish off the rats while Nez bleeds into the gutter, and come to him as his eyes flicker open... nearly lost to the furry cloud of death.\n\nThanks to a couple of INCREDIBLE rolls, the rats dropped Nez immediately.  He went onto death saves, so I offered my inspiration point from least session to try and stabilize him.  He rolled two very small numbers. We failed our medicine checks. He failed his second death save. \n\nI have never been so tense as I was that session.  \n\nHe made his final death save and we all cheered - it was incredible.  We ended the session there, but we left humbled. We talked up a big game to the governor about those kobolds, but we were thoroughly unprepared for the terror, the unrelenting carnage... of some rats.",

        "text": "This is the short tale of how a set pathfinder adventure path devolved into managing toddlers, and a single cleric of Sarenrae.\n\nI was running Rise of the Runelords, Modified for the current pathfinder system, because the original was made with 3.5 in mind, and I wanted to change a few things around to make it a bit slower paced to allow the players to have a chance to do their own thing between the modules. Two of my friends from the prior campaign had joined up with me after we patched some wounds over a few talks and played through darkest dungeon together, But we still needed two more people.\n\nAfter making a few adds and spreading the word around, we got three players, but they were all troublemakers, as was one of the returning players, but we'll get to that. I had made pre-gen's for the new players, just your standard dwarven fighter, orc barb, half-elf bard, etc. Along with a small bit of paper giving the newbie an idea of what they'd be playing if they chose that pre-gen and which characters from fiction they could use as reference (Conan the barbarian, legolas the ranger, gandalf the wizard, etc). The two who I knew prior showed up with their own, a viking cleric who was fine, and a chaotic neutral elf called...legolas, who was a ranger.\n\nI didn't realize how important a session zero was until after we had cleared a small goblin cave, because there wasn't much rping involved until they freed some people. They were asked if they had seen Olga, one of the NPC's who had ran off prior to the party arriving...And quick as a whip, Legolas said \"yes, I killed her, stuck her like a pig with my arrows.\" He had not actually killed her, and we all just gave him this look.\n\nThe NPC was a little upset by this, in fact, when they got to town, he nearly killed Legolas (who shall henceforth be referred to as lego). The only thing that stopped him was Olga appearing beside the town's guard captain, because while I am a tough but fair DM, killing a PC in the second session of a campaign didn't feel right. Little did I know how much time doing that would have saved.\n\nThey dragged his ass to the temple, and this was when the forth and fifth player showed up, out of nowhere, proclaiming they'd like to try and play D&amp;D. Considering I was running a club and appreciated the idea of new members, I said sure, handed them the pre-gens and let them pick something out. They went with the Half orc barb.\n\nShe immediately tried to steal Lego's corpse...While the guard captain was dragging him along, with everyone else following, and in full view of a crowd of people. When this nat 1 failed, the players were turned out of the church, taken to the mayor, paid 50 gold for their services each, and offered another job. They had to watch over the coming festival, acting as extra guards while it took place, and would get extra if they helped out around the town. I gave them four days downtime, which backfired horribly.\n\nThe barb tried to steal a fucking pig from the local butchers, she also tried to seduce the pig, then ended up stripping and collapsing in the town square yelling \"I want my mummy!\". The guards knocked her out and tossed her in jail. The other new player (who had switched from a monk to a dwarf fighter, cos he wanted to experiment a little and i was fine with that, seeing as he was still new to d&amp;d.), decided to try and save her, so he snuck into the guards barracks, nat 1 failed, and got dog piled on by five guys and the captain who pounded his face into the stone floor before tossing the pair of them in jail. They then tried to kill the jailer, by pelting him with pebbles...\n\nLego however, decided to go hunting, specifically wolves, an entire pack of them, at level 2, by himself. He might have been able to do it if he hadn't openly walked over to them and started firing as he got closer. Instead he was left to bleed out and he somehow managed to not die, and slowly healed back to 1 HP over the course of two days. I rolled on the random encounter chart for shits and giggles, he saw a stegosaurus, a cyclops that nearly ate him, a black elder wyrm, and a unicorn. But we passed it off as him hallucinating because he drugged himself with a poor medicine check. He dragged himself back, got patched up and arrived in time for the festival.\n\nThe cleric was the only one who did what I had hoped, he went around town, learned the layout, made friends with the blacksmith, the local church and even got a part time job. Guy was a decent rper.\n\nThe festival started, and i decided to let the two chuckle heads out of jail if they promised to behave...took them ten minutes to mess it up. To be fair, after a chat outside the game with the barb, she was trying to do better, but not the dwarf. After washing naked in the river, he strolled back into town with nothing but his beard covering his taint. \n\nLego and the cleric were talking to a Hellknight who had arrived from the nearby city, wanted to oversee the christening of a new church and be the orders representative for the events. A Hellknight is basically fantasy judge dredd, except they all look like sauron and worship satan, very law and order types. The naked dwarf thought it would be funny to walk up to the Hellknight, headbutt him in the nuts, and run away. A short chase occured, which saw the naked dwarf try to rape the butchers pig before the hellknight smashed his spine with a mace, crippling him, then dragged him back to jail. I was done with him after that and booted him from the game.\n\nAfter this, Lego, after seeing what had just happened...tried to steal the pig, then just covered himself in mud and slept next to it while the festival went on, he never explained why he did this.\n\nThe festival was pretty uneventful until the combat in the module started. The next bit was entirely my fault though. I had more goblins attack the town than what the module said, and had the players fight beside some of the towns stronger NPC's, showing off who lived within this town and maybe peak their interest as to what kind of stuff they expected. But I think I stole the players thunder a little by doing this, and swapped things up near the end, letting them kill off the goblin leader and such. \n\nThe game ended after the cheers and celebrations, because the barbarian girl left because she didn't want to do this without her friend, and we couldn't run the module without two more players. All in all, it was a failure of a campaign, but it taught me some important lessons, like not including pigs in my campaigns ever again.",

Zemek was the first to wake up, and asked the woman if she was his “good fight”- the woman said something to him in Orcish that caused the two to smile, and they commenced battle. Meanwhile, a group of undead monks had started to approach from the outside, making the situation even worse. However, in spite of our initial disadvantage, we were somehow able to emerge victorious without a single death (Bler came quite close, but we managed to heal him up without losing anybody). We took a look around the house after the fighting was over, and found yet another black orb (this time around, we were careful to handle it with a heavy layer of cloth). After a bit, we finished looting and burning the bodies, and Augustus decided to scour the area surrounding the house to see if there were any other undead lurking in the shadows- while he failed to find any undead, he found a man who bore Attinae’s holy symbol, gag and bound beneath a wagon. We gave the man some water, and he introduced himself as Zabu. He was apparently a cleric of the Goddess, and had been leading a group of her worshippers through the wastes as part of a pilgrimage; however, they came under attack from the undead, and he was left alive to serve as a sacrifice. He then offered to heal us as repayment, which some of us accepted. He then attempted to leave, but due to the nature of our mission, we brought him along with us. By this point, I believed our mission to have been completed and wanted to return to base, but Augustus (and other members of the group) wanted to keep exploring, so we ventured out further. \n\n###A Battle During Breakfast and A Curse:\nA few days later, while preparing for breakfast, a single, giant, undead monk approached us- somewhat amusingly, it asked for coffee, so we obliged, hoping it’d leave. It kind of remained there for a while, and began to prepare for combat. We were all kind of annoyed, but began to prepare for a fight ourselves. It really didn’t last long, but the monk had been able to grab Augustus during the fight. It laid a curse mark on him, so we began looking for ways to remove it, all of which were unsuccessful. *I tried to tell them that \"we've already done our mission, let's head back.\" But he just haaad to insist on going further. His fault really.* Eventually Zabu stepped in, and after sacrificing a part of himself to Attinae, he was able to determine it wasn’t from a god of this world. We immediately returned to base and informed Khan of the events of our mission- Augustus wound up getting quarantined and put under observation (with Eirika supervising), and the rest of us were given a week off (but we had to write a report of what we had seen).\n\n###Blades, Angry Orcs, Dragonscale, and Pregnancies:\nNow this was a rather interesting week for our squad. It started off with Ten of the Thousand Blades arriving at Fort Deathwatch- apparently some of our efforts had warranted further attention and reinforcements. From there, Augustus had apparently finally learned that Eirika was pregnant (it was more or less an open secret by this point- he was simply the last to learn), so he was in a good mood after he was released from quarantine. Meanwhile, Zemek didn’t really do anything in particular, instead just focusing on training and helping around the base. He mostly seemed angry about something that had happened during the mission, but I never had a chance to ask. Finally, Dent and I both went to Dragonscale for parts of our R&amp;R. I’m not entirely sure what Dent did while there, nor do I know why he had finally taken advantage of his leave. Personally, I had gone there because of you: your mother and I both wanted to have a child, but weren’t quite as fortunate as other couples. *”It wasn’t just me that was having the troubles. It was both of us. She knows damn well that I’m not impo-” Looking over at his glass, the mage realized that it would probably be a good idea to lighten up on the drinking.* As such, I began looking around for magic items that would help us out. I eventually came across a rather peculiar store that was ran by a human and an intelligent ferret with a metallic arm- I think it was called the North Breeze Trading Collective. After a bit of looking around and negotiating, I was able to secure a scroll that contained a spell that helps with having children. *Oh shit. I never got around to paying him back, did I?* I rode back to the base not long after and met up with your mother- I explained what the scroll was for, and we used it.\n",

        "text": "This is a tale from my first time playing d&amp;d many years ago, it didn't last long, nor did it go that well, but there were many fun moments from it, all culminating in my decision to get some revenge.\n\nWe had a party of six. a clumsy cleric, a dumb barbarian called bob, an asshole monk, a sorcerer who loved dragons, a chaotic evil necromancer, and me, the half-elf bard, Kenny.\n\nGame was a standard faerun campaign, boiled down to getting a book back from a snake cult, had us going from kobold cave, to mountain cave, to city.\n\nThere were a few accidents, like my first crit, which insta killed the sorcerer on accident because i didn't know you couldn't shoot through occupied squares. But we rolled it back and continued without much issue until after the Kobold cave. \n\nWe got back to our employer and told her that we didn't have the book, found a naga (which we stuffed in a sack and murdered while it was drunk), and a few other signs of snake cult stuff. she sent us in the direction of another city, we never found out the name, but it was probably either water deep or baldurs gate if i had to guess.\n\nThis is when things began to turn sour.\n\nUntil then we had been making snide remarks here and there, but otherwise getting along. But the moment we split up for the day to gather our supplies and stuff, things went south. First, the necromancer found a random peasent and charmed them into a hotel room where he slaughtered them and shoved their corpse into a travel box. Then after I had done what a bard does best, play some music for money, he found me and threatened to murder me for all the money i had. Not the money I earned, ALL my money. I caved and gave it to him, then ten minutes later he cracked me over the head with a cane for picking a flower. Then as we were leaving the city, I insulted him and he aimmed a scorching ray at me, I aimmed my crossbow at him, the cleric raised his mace, and the barbarian raised his axe and waited to kill whoever attacked first. This all happened in front of our employer as she said goodbye. We slowly pulled back our weapons, bought horses, and a donkey. I was stuck with the donkey...Turns out the donkey was too small to carry me, so I had to walk behind everyone, and no one slowed down for me, leaving me two miles behind them by the time they got to the next town for a nights sleep.\n\nI also found the corpses of guards on my way down the road, I knew OOC the party killed them, and IC i recognized who did it from the handiwork. So I took three hours to bury and give rites to the dead before moving on, got to the town, went to the inn, booked the nicest room, put it on the parties tab, went to bed. \n\nFrom then until we got to the city, not much special happened, aside from us destroying a magical item because the DM had a shade drain me of 5 points of STR the moment i touched it, and we thought the item was cursed or something.\n\nWhen we got to the city, we woke up around the corpse of a dead noble. Turns out we had blacked out, killed him, and woke up. The first thing i did was try to convince the surrounding crowd that this man was a heretic to the god of the city...The mage threw a fireball into the crowd half way through my nat 20 bluff check. Guards came, we killed them, and ran.\n\nWe fucked about the city a bit and the party kept kicking me out of hiding places whenever guards came by because they kinda thought it was funny watching me bluff and run like hell...it got old fast.\n\nWe eventually met up with these rebel people who claimed to know us, and wanted to help us clear our names. We helped them out, got a cool sword out of it, and then were told to head to one of their bases at a warehouse by the docks. We decided to sleep there for a bit before going to the actual safehouse, I suggested we climb into some crates to hide and sleep inside the bigger ones. We did that, and I found a box full of fucking silk, a royal mattress and some silk PJ's. everyone else had other decent stuff, but I got the best cos nat 20 search check.\n\nThis was when the line was crossed.\n\nWhile sleeping, they (the necromancer and the monk) sealed me inside of the crate, and then dragged it to the side of the dock to toss me into the sea. I only got out because i started punching holes through the crate and nearly impaled one of them. They didn't get me out, i had to smash my way out while they went to the hideout which was underneath the warehouse.\n\nI gathered whale oil, the silk from the crate i was in, and a bunch of other stuff, then, set fire to the warehouse after sealing the entrance to the hideout shut. Then as i ran away, got some guards to check it out using a diplomacy check and illusion to hide my face so i didn't look like the wanted poster.\n\nThe fire killed a few, the guards caught and killed the rest, I was set free and left the town. I wouldn't have done it if they hadn't all been assholes to me, but I was sick of it and wanted revenge.",

Lit ablaze by the Valnaen Occupation Army, a communistic regime who would rather see this city in ashes than outside of their control.\n\n\nOur ranger success on his climb check to scale a three story building to get a better look at the situation. The town he has known his entire life is an ocean of fire. Even though he comes from the tribal people of the plains, this city has taken him in and made him feel welcome. Scared and unsure how his true aim can fix this problem, he makes a desperate plea to his ancestors for help.\n\n\n----------------------------\n\n\nAh'naht is essentially a Native American tracker. My player asks if his character can attempt a rain dance to quell the flames. I tell him he must dance for me, the player stands up and begins some bizarre interpretative dance. After about 3 minutes of watching him flail for the sake of wanting to try this, I tell him that it is a slim chance that the ancestors will hear your call. He needs to roll the percentage dice - only a 99 or 100 will be a success.\n\n\n----------------------------\n\n\nAh'naht starts to dance. The party is confused as fuck about what their odd ranger is starting to do. They begin to run about the town trying to save people and get a fire brigade going to cut the losses and save as much of the city as they can. The dark skies full of ash and smoke begin to darken even more....\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\nThe player rolls a 100. My players cheer. I cue up 'Africa' by Toto as I describe the events that unfold.\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\nAh'naht feels an awakening. The movement of his body begins to mirror that of his ancestors, he cries out to them with each undulation of his hips. Moving fluidly like piping hot caramel, he starts to feel the cool rain upon his body. Joy rushes through his body as he continues to dance, watching his ancestors pour rain over the city. While the tribes may have had conflict with the townsfolk for years now they offer their aid in a moment of peaceful redemption.\n\n\nAfter the dance, amidst the pouring rain. Ah'naht bows to the city, proud of his performance. His calling was not a hunter and tracker - he realized he always was a dancer.\n\n\n----------------------------\n\n\nMy players recieve their experience, the ranger getting a huge bonus for his actions which is enough to level up. Ah'naht's PC tells me that he is abandoning the ways of the ranger to now become a Bard. He will make his ancestors proud.",

The latest one we've been doing was one we found on DM's Guild, called Shore of Dreams (highly recommend it, we've played it for 2 sessions so far since we tend to play in short bursts).  \n\nNormally I tend toward casters, especially Bards, but I wanted to try something different; and the guy who was DMing this little adventure played a barbarian a while back and I was kind of inspired.  Enter my character, Lucan Ba'nar - high elf scholar.  I describe him as a regal looking fellow in glasses, has a quarter staff, nice robes tied with a sash and a ornate golden brooch, tattoo on his hand, and kind of awkwardly carrying a longsword on his back.  Complete with owl familiar.\n\nWe have a rogue, a druid and a mystic in the party.  First session is mostly RP heavy, I use my 7 charisma, play the awkward, shy geek.  Make friends with the Shepherd Druid over animals, talk about magic.  Toward the end of the session the tavern we're in gets beset by thugs.  I'm the last one down the stairs.  I see the thugs harassing the patrons, my friends all around.\n\nLucan steps forward and points at a thug - \"hey! You! You're a bully!\"\n\nOne of our other players: \"Oh no, he's gonna get himself obliterated...\"\n\nLucan: \"I hate bullies!\"  I then describe Lucan taking off his glasses, folding them and tucking them into his pocket, unsheathing his sword and taking two reckless swipes at the thugs as he rages.\n\nFriends go insane.

I had a lot to think about while weaving them, particularly concerning death. After I finished, I met with your mother, and asked her where she saw the two of us going, particularly owing to our circumstances- she was taken by surprise, but was flattered. She then told me that she wanted to make our relationship a bit more “official”. We got permission for her to leave base, and rode out to Dragonscale. If nothing else, I want you to hold onto the robes; they’re the reason you exist. *Who knows? Maybe the kid or my grandkids will turn out like me, get some use out of them.* Anyway, we were walking to the Temple of Dracorex to have the ceremony conducted, I noticed that Zemek had also visited the city and appeared to be following me- I say this because he attempted to hide behind a thin, potted tree after I noticed him. The wedding was conducted at a local temple dedicated to Dracorex, and was a rather short affair; however, we were told that our union had been blessed by the Storm King himself, given my conversion and the fact that we were both descendants of dragons (I had been unaware of my heritage until this point). After was all said and done, your mother and I hurried off to an inn by the name of the Painted Lady, spending most of our brief honeymoon there. ~~And that’s how you were ma~~ *Pausing for a second, the mage gave a slight grin. “That was a really, really, good day, but I figured that the kid wouldn’t need to know everything about it.”* For some reason the serving boys sent for room service were pale, every once in a while we heard a fight outside of our room and our expenses were paid for by “the painted lady her- *Gods damn it.* Now that I think of it, it’s entirely possible Zemek paid off our entire tab and harassed the serving boys sent to tend to us. Regardless, we returned to the base the next morning- I’m not really sure how to put it into words, but I felt some weird sense of bliss as we rode back. I can’t say what the others did during their downtime, Zemek aside- all I know is that, at some point, Dent learned the language of the Undead.\n\n###More Issues with Summoning and Forgotten Occasions:\nAfter our R&amp;R was up, Khan summoned the squad personally. He gave us orders to deal with an inhabited farmhouse that popped up in the wastes, along with exploring as much land as possible within two weeks. We got a total of three days to prepare for the mission, and were dismissed. Later that evening, I asked Augustus to serve as backup of the sorts- I intended to test out another summoning spell. I’m not sure whether the spell page was cursed or was simply very specific, but it just summoned the same tiefling as before. This caused a larger commotion from him than last time, and before I could try to fix the issue, Dent and Zemek jumped into the fray. A fair bit of arguing later, the only “progress” we made was the rest of the squad learning about my marriage, with Augustus being upset that he hadn’t been invited to the ceremony. *Of all the things for him to be upset about, that was probably the pettiest. Besides, it’s not like he was in a position to judge, that good for nothing baSTA- alright, getting off topic, focus.* That aside, we had gotten nowhere- by this point, the tiefling, realizing he was on a legion base, tried to sell us contraband from the Mage’s Guild. Fortunately for us, your mother had also noticed the commotion, and knocked the tiefling out, sending him back to where he came from. Of course, this led to a debate on whether to tell Khan about what had taken place- before we could decide on what to do, he walked up behind us, and asked “tell Khan what?” After a bit of fumbling around on our end, he dismissed all of us for the evening, save for Augustus and Zemek. Your mother and I returned to her quarters; once we arrived, she gave me a chance to explain what had happened. She believed my explanation, but was eager to change the topic to something else. I can’t recall much of what we discussed. ~~but she did bring up children on one occas~~. *Hold on a second. I honestly hope that wasn’t why she wanted children- don’t need that to be another thing I’ve screwed up.* We continued to talk for a while, and wound up spending the evening together. The next day, I overheard that Augustus had some relationship trouble of his own: he had apparently forgotten Eirika’s birthday. I saw him scrambling across the base over the course of the day, trying to get her something to make up for his mistake- I recall that he got advice from Zemek and Dent, but I’m not entirely sure what it entailed. However, the two seemed to be in a pleasant enough mood when the squad departed, so he presumably did a good job at making up for the mistake. Our journey was largely the same as any other outing: a few days of travel, fought some undead along the way, and then we were there.\n\n###Extinct Elves and Dinner:\nAs the farmhouse came into sight, we saw two undead and an elf, petrified from fear. We rode up and killed the zombies, but the fellow was terrified by the presence of humans, an orc, and a hulking, multi-armed figure. Augustus was able to calm him down a bit, so the elf felt comfortable enough leading him into the house so the two could talk things over with his wife. They emerged a few minutes later, and Augustus asked for Zemek and I to come serve as guards while the Paladin helped secure a perimeter. While hesitant, they agreed to the arrangement after learning that I spoke Elven. I was able to get a closer look at the two in the light, and they were remarkably different from any elf that I’d ever seen- they had ears like the Langites, more human-like proportions, and sharpened nails (almost like claws). I attempted to make small talk with the couple to calm them down a bit, wound up talking about other kinds of Elves and how long the couple has resided there. They eventually mentioned that their ancestors used to occupy the wastes in great numbers, until humans wiped them out; they shot me a look of hatred and spat at my feet, so I backed off and called Augustus back in. *I really should’ve read into that a bit more, considering how terrified they were earlier.* The Aasimar had more luck talking to the elves, and learned a great deal about that particular offshoot of elves and how they’ve survived out in the wastes for so long (according to them, their house repelled undead for a reason they didn’t understand). Not long after, the rest of the party poured into the house, so they asked us what the purpose of our visit was: Augustus told them that we were tasked with bringing them back to civilization. After a bit of conversation, the couple said they would think about it overnight, and served us dinner (as a precautionary measure, I turned down their offer). Once we were done eating, Dent and Augustus began to talk over what to do in the event the elves said no- they wound up disagreeing on this issue, causing an argument that spiraled out of control and brought most of the party members onto either side. Eventually, Augustus stormed out to patrol the area, Dent inspected some magical runes around the house, and the rest of us slept by the fireside.\n",

        "text": "Greeting's Lord Manshoon,\n\nIt is I your Right Hand, Elite Shore. As I stated previously (at least I hope I did) I am once again sending you a report on the current situation I am in on the strange new continent of Ranur.\nAs you are aware I left off on Zulnn reaching to open the door and I reaching to stop him.\nSo I’ll continue from there.\n\nAs Zulnn reached for the door I grabbed his hand and told him it’s a bad idea to open a door that we’re pretty sure has a blazing fire on the other side. So I smoothed talked our friend El Fuego (who was being so quiet I forgot he was even there at first) into kicking the door down. Well surprisingly that actually worked and we learned that he’s immune to fire. So a total win-win situation!!\nClearly, the smart idea is to wait and see if trouble was on the other side of this fire which I wholly expected there to be. So we waited… and waited… and waited… Father you know I’m an impatient being so understandably I rushed through the fire with Zulnn, and low and behold on the other side of this fire (which didn’t hurt me by the way, intriguing no?) was a freaking creepy little girl with black empty eyes and a freaky wide smile!! You know I love orphans. FOR HEIMDALL’S SAKE I SPONSOR AN ORPHANAGE!!! Yet, this tiny child set off my fight or flight senses. However, I did as I usually do with young children. I acted like a big brother even though my nervousness made it very hard.\nBefore we left Zulnn accepted a doll from the tiny child. I told her goodbye little sister and we left through the door we entered and… found ourselves in a frozen tundra. Also, it seemed like we were being watched but three shadowy figures from a distance. Not cool, no pun intended.\nFOR THE LOVE OF THE ALLFATHER!!!! \nSo get this. We traveled against the wind. The 30-40 MPH WIND!!!! I’m starting to question Zulnn’s sanity for he was the one who chose to do this. All I can do is pray to Heimdall for foresight and to The Raven Queen for not taking us yet, even if she currently losing her power.\nThen… all of a sudden we’re in a room. In a room with Dracovich, Greggor, and “Hecate/Hado”.\nI knew it. We were in Hecate/Hado’s mind. Makes sense considering how creepy and unbalanced it was.\nAfter some light conversation and the agreement to let Dracovich talk to “Hecate/Hado,” we left through the door that frees us from Hecate/Hado’s mind.\nAll of a sudden I find myself waking in an alleyway. Why am I here? How did I end up unconscious? Meh, I can think about this out when I go to bed. Right now it’s time to get my stuff back. Maybe kill a few people if needed. I wouldn’t mind shedding some blood. The iron smell reminds me of life on the sea.\nHa, I remember sliting the throats of so many enemies. Hmm, I wonder how my old Captain is doing?\n\nAfter a brief moment of insanity caused by trying to remember how in the world we got a bunch of Platinum making me realize maybe I’ll stick to my original plan of “try to remember everything later,” I reached the checkpoint. Ah, you see a checkpoint is a sort of sign-in the area you must visit in order to get to the third floor. Oh did I forget to mention that this city is multi-layered? I must apologize.\nAnyway, when I reached the checkpoint I ran into this obviously new to the job guard. His name is Samuel. I know what your thinking. “Really? You kill a demon lords right-hand whose name is Sampson then you run into a Guard named Samuel? What are the odds?” Trust me I thought it was funny too.\nHowever, this one needed some encouragement. Afterall what is freedom If you’re not brave enough to enjoy it! So after buttering him up and making him proud to be him, I entered the third floor. However, I didn’t make it very far because apparently members of the group I’m traveling with thought it would be a good idea to accompany me. I see nothing wrong with this. Traveling in a group either repels trouble or encourages it. We both know I enjoy fighting. Almost as much as I enjoy keeping souvenirs from past fights. Speaking of which!!! I can totally do since our Paladin eats dead bodies. Me keeping a finger from a fallen enemy would seem like nothing compared to that right? It helps enemies realize they shouldn’t mess with a Viper.\n\nAlso just because it's so hilarious I just had to inform you of this. The Barbarian Greggor. Tried to sign his name and just couldn't. Lose his cool slammed the quill down and when I offered to sign it for him he grumbled a reluctant yes. Hahaha! Oh also Get this!! Zulnn the Cleric. He's gigantic and can barely even hold a quill. However, he signed his name in such a fabulous style I swear I saw sparkles and roses start to appear around him!!! Like it was so impressive it was like he used magic!!! He didn't though. I would have felt it in the air. Pure freaking skill! Then get this he sprinkles ink across the page and they land perfectly giving the signature an extra bit of flair. I think you should higher Zulnn to do the paperwork, and I'm not just saying that to get out of doing my own paperwork...\n\nANYWAY!!!\nAs we arrived at designated located on the third floor we entered the area and two people were there. After they asked in a rather rude way who I was, I only asked them what there were in for. Eh, petty crime, they said. They asked me what I was in for. So as a form of nonchalant intimidation I said: “Lots of things I bet. If I ever got caught.” I then slammed the card I received against the wall. Basically saying I have no time for ideal chitchat. They looked at me then looked at each other and nodded. Hit the wall and it opened up.\n\nWell, what do you know? A hidden tavern.\nAs we walked in the music stopped. I said don’t stop on my account! So they continued. I then approached the bar to talk to the tavern wench. A Dragonborn. Hmm, she looked pretty good. Actually, that reminded me… uh… Father… could you do me a favor? Out there somewhere, there might be a… offspring of mine. Mine and a Female Silver Dragon. Could you… just be on the lookout? A Dragonborn Shore… That might cause some issues. After all! You know The Shore Family has a… addiction to acquiring power. So… yeah.\n\nANYWAY!!!! As I resisted flirting with the Dragonborn I blatantly asked where the Fence was.\nYou know because I’ve already been having a horrid day. She looked at me like I was crazy.\nShe then asked why I needed to know. I want my stuff back! I said looking at her like she asked the craziest thing ever.\nShe looked at me and nudged her head down towards the Elf.\nSo understandably I went to him got my stuff back. The Elf… was a disrespectful old fool but I’m used to dealing with folks like him. After all. You taught me how. I then told Dracovich that if they cause us any more trouble. Burn the place down with all of them inside.\nHowever, I recommend sending more Agents here. They need to learn to fear The Zhentarim.\n\nAs we returned to the Tavern we started the day in we ran into another old companion of this group. Apparently, a Revenant turned Human named Kami No… Suki? Something like that. I haven’t had the chance to speak to him yet due to him seeing Zulnn grabbing his Axe and dragging him out of the bar. Nor has anyone told me how to spell his name.\nAs I ordered my food I started to think. As they often do when no one is talking to me my thoughts got deep. Why did I accept this mission? What is my purpose? What is my goal?\nThat one I kept popping up.\n\nWhat is my goal?\nI wanted to become The Raven Queens Champion. However, she's losing her power and needs our help. The help of mortals.\nHmm, strange.\n\nWhat about my other goal?\nTo kill my family. To stop them from summoning The Cat Lord and binding his power to them. Allowing them to become immensely powerful.\nThat obviously needs to not happen. How do I stop them?\nBy gaining power right? That’s where my first goal comes in. However… once you become someone's champion… your will is bound to theirs. You lose freedom. No. No. NO!\n\nI refuse to be bound by a higher power!! MY LIFE IS MINE! I DESERVE FREEDOM!!!\nFreedom… freedom is obtained through power.\n\nWait.\n\nThat’s it! That’s what I’ll do!\n\nMy Lord!\nFather.\nI have a new goal.\nOne worthy of an Asgardian!\nI will become a Deity\nThe Deity of Power, Freedom, and Celebration!\nFor with power, you gain freedom, and when you are free you celebrate, you celebrate the fact you are free, free because you gained power.\nFather, I must end this report here.\nI’ll be writing you again soon.\n\nSigned, 𝕰𝖑𝖎𝖙𝖊 𝕾𝖍𝖔𝖗𝖊, Heir of Shore, Viper of The Zhentarim, Right Hand and Adopted Son of Lord Manshoon",

        "text": "[Previous posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawkinggreentext/comments/81bol7/hungry_are_the_dead_repository/)\n\n---------\n\nChasing off a rather rude bard, David took a sip of his drink, before getting back to work on the letters. *Where was I again? Oh yes, there.*\n\n-----\n\n###Respite, Almost Losing Your Mother, and a New Mission:\n\nAs it turns, the energy grenades I gave your mother were *technically* contraband, so she was punished. This, combined with the smell of ~~shi~~ waste and orcish cuisine, caused your mother to avoid me for several days. After a while, she decided that the two of us should simply be friends. Not long after, I set out to Dragonscale for R&amp;R; while buying some gifts (perfume and a turquoise necklace) to apologize to your mother, I was entranced by a preacher of Dracorex, and converted. My conversion, along with the gifts I’d brought, were enough to sway her back. Augustus and Bler accompanied me to the city as well- Bler simply harassed various women that wouldn’t go out with “a nice guy like me”, and Augustus, hoping to impress Eirika, learned Elvish and bought materials to write poetry. Back at base, Dent apparently didn’t do too much aside from helping around base, and I recall somebody mentioning something about Zemek “taking down all the medical personnel as a secondary challenge.” *I never actually learned that people meant by that. Maybe I can ask once we get back.* At the end of our twenty days, Khan assembled the entire unit in the courtyard. He said that the King, heeding the unit’s call for reinforcements, sent Song of Twenty Warriors, a member of his Personal Guard (the Thousand Blades). He then directed his attention towards my squad, and offered us a mission: to retake an abandoned fort out in the wastes. Accepting would give us a week of personal training with the Blade before our deployment, and success would guarantee a promotion. We all accepted.\n\n###Preparations, A Fortress, and Learning About Each Other:\n\nThe night before our training was due to start, I decided to test a spell page I’d found in Dragonscale- I didn’t know what it did, so I wanted to see whether it would be useful before taking it out to the field. It turned out to contain a summoning spell of some nature, and the Tiefling I summoned was not amused- a lot of accusations were exchanged until Dent, who witnessed the whole affair, knocked the fellow out. *Not my finest hour, but it was a genuine mistake. How was I supposed to know what the spell scroll did? It’s not like I’m some expert on the stuff.* The week of training went by, and we were out in the Wastes again. On our way to the old fort, we cleared out a crumbling pyramid, so we spent the night there. As we were preparing our rations, we wound up sharing details about our lives to each other: Augustus’ mother, a worshipper of Lyrica had been “blessed” by an angel, who abandoned her before his birth. After her death, he lived with his uncle, who beat him- this drew accusations from Bler that he was also abused in other ways, which continued for the rest of the evening. He then said that he volunteered to join the unit, out of some desire to prove himself. I shared why I had been forced into the unit, Bler mostly insulted his mother (but muttered bits and pieces of other information), and we learned that Dent was at least humanoid, but he had been granted a “suit” after making a deal. We continued our journey in the morning, arriving at the fort around noon- as it turns, they were expecting us, and made fortifications.\n\n###Taking the Fort and a Warning: \n\nSeeing that the undead massed skeleton archers on our right flank and spread out melee fighters on their left, we devised a plan: Dent, having a fully enclosed suit, would advance on the archers, Bler would sneak up to the entrance, and the rest of us would force our way through the melee fighters. The plan worked for the most part- the arrows simply bounced off of Dent, Bler got the upper hand on some undead guards, and the rest of us made quick work of the ghouls and zombies that were in our path. However, we eventually heard a primal and wretched screen come from the Fort- I saw an undead beast flay Bler. In order to clear a path to the ninja, I finished off some undead Zemek had picked a fight with- I didn’t realize it at the time, but this act bothered the orc on a fundamental level. After some further effort, Dent and Zemek finished off the remaining archers and fighters, and we were able to heal Bler’s wounds. With the fort cleared, we began our journey back to the base. On the first night, I received a visit from the Orc- he offered a few choice words on “stealing kills” and branded me with the word “Remember” to serve as a reminder. As soon as he was done, the orc praised my work as a combat mage. Upon our return to the base, we noticed that the walls had been fortified further, and received a briefing about the nature of our enemy. On top of promotions, we also received a week of leave for our success.\n",

        "text": "I'm the player, not GM. Some backstory: my half orc is in training to become one of the rangers. At 6ft tall, excitable muscle of the female that I am, I need all the work with training that I can get. I've left actual training grounds with another ranger, Wilt, to do some questing so we're forced to improvise with my stealth work. Wilt is older than my orc, very quite and serious and often complains that I annoy him.\n\nWilt suggests getting into some trouble - playing a game - while resting up at an inn on our way back from a mission. Unusual coming from one normally so serious but very much up for some fun, especially because I doubt Wilt would know what fun was if it hit him upside the head.\n\n He says to meet outside the inn in 10 minutes ready with my cloak (it's basically a magically made camouflage cloak).\n\nNot long after going outside, I'm blessed with the sight of Wilt jogging towards me with a pumpkin much wider than he is and perhaps a 1/3 of his height. \n\nGrinning ear to ear, he hands me the gigantic pumpkin to hold and casually leans against the building taking off and folding up his cloak while suddenly shouting, \"OVER HERE! I'VE SPOTTED THE PUMPKIN THIEF!!\" \n\nI stand shocked for a moment before realizing what's happening. I hear shouts and footsteps quickly coming closer. Panicked, I quickly bury the pumpkin in some nearby garbage and crawl over it, making sure all the orange is covered by my cloak.\n\nThankfully, the farmers run pass without noticing me. I get up and very excitedly ask, \"My turn now?\"\n\nWilt smiles and says sure! I tell him to wait here with the cloak on and I start prowling vendors for the largest, gaudiest object I can find. \n\nSoon, I stumble upon a potter's shop who has a very large and quite colourful vase for sale. I sneak in behind and begin to pick up the booty. As I'm lifting it off the table, I look up and have locked eyes with the shop owner. He asks, \"paying for that?\"\n\nI panic and lift the vase over my head and start sprinting towards the inn with the shop owner closely behind me. I'm excited to watch Wilt get out of this one!!\n\nAs I round the corner to the inn, Wilt is no where to be seen. I yell, \"Wilt?!? I've got  a jar of dirt for you!!\" ...and nothing. No Wilt. \n\nI can't dilly dally with the shop owner so close behind me shouting so I curse and continue running taking random twists and turns into small alleyways. I slowly begin to outpace the shop owner and get to a crossroads in the alleyway and hide the vase and myself behind some barrles.\n\nHe jogs past and looks down the other alleys. Not seeing me, he starts turning and walking back down the alley I'm hiding in slowly. I carefully pick up a rock and wait for him to look away from my direction and toss the rock further down the alley. \n\nIt works, he hears the sound of the rock and chases after it. I wait a moment before taking a meandering path back to the inn, gaudy vase angrily in tow.\n\nWilt is now waiting outside the inn smirking at me. \n\n\"Well, you didn't get caught though I wouldn't say you were exactly stealthy,\" He laughs.\n\nI'm too angry to think so shove the vase in his arms and stalk into the inn as he drops some coins into it and places it near where the potter can see it for when he comes back to his shop.\n\nAnd that ends what I thought was a hilarious small event that happened in the game we're playing.

        "text": "I did this in Mobile, if you want more tales I can tell you the story of the our Minotaur that died by his own hand in spectacular fashion \n\nLet me tell you a story about my best kill in my shadowrun campaign. Our team is as follows me, on my fourth character, a mystical adept face with some close quarters combat, our mage who was not present for this particular exchange, our second face who was just a telephone exchange operator, our hacker that was in a bacta tank recovering because he tried (and almost succeeded) in hacking into Ares to try to delete their databases since they were after him after he started an international incident involving a successful spoof of an emergency signal that ended with an Ares Thor shot on a African  President's Villa,  a small Asian thief, and our favorite character in the whole campaign John.\n\n\nJohn was a mutated orc that was 14 years old with a mane that mutated colors according to his mood, he was a rigger that had no drones and specialized in explosives and being a party ambassador. I'm not kidding in an undercover role he walked in as a party ambassador and did such a good job he got international Fame. At this point we had a contract with the Kosovo mafia after the escape from Africa landed us in Kosovo, they outsourced a whore house in Detroit. John wanted to make an example of being in charge and decided to crash the pimps and hoes ball of Detroit and steal their best girls and lay down the law. We got kitted out, everyone was dressed to the nine's in the most pimptacular gear we could find and made a convoy. I dressed exactly like Plies in this music video: https://youtu.be/lMUTIuSnDXY\n\n\nSo we make our way to the pimps and hoes ball and convoy style with everyone in different flashy cars and each of us with two girls. Each pimp brought party favors to the ball to show off to everyone standing outside these gifts were things like bottles of liquor or pimp hats to hand out to the normal people hanging outside the ball.\n\n\nI said I wanna make it rain GM says no paper money to make it rain with, so I do the only other thing I can think of a cred chip gun. I loaded that sucker with 100 nyen cred chips and sat on the hood of my car and headed up the back of the convoy. Everyone else gets to the red carpet and hand out their goodies and start making it inside. I pull up and start making it rain cred chips and finally someone shouts these are 100 nyen cred chips!!! Everyone went crazy and the riot happened, I was not built for combat so I start booking it into the gala but I was stopped by some thugs on the way inside. So I did the only thing I could shot him with the credit chip gun and rolled 5 physical damage. GM ruled that the shot was straight to the neck and killed the thug outright, seeing their comrade killed by a cred chip gun was enough for the other find to decide this is above their pay grade and booked it. Only confirmed kill with a cred chip in the campaign.\n\n\n\n\n",

It’ll be…. interesting.*\n\n-------\n\n###Meeting Your Mother and Departure:\n\nWe were all given a week of rest before our first official mission, which we used in varying ways. Zemek and Bler helped around base, Augustus had a tryst with an Elven officer by the name of Eirika, and Bler refined his techniques. Meanwhile, I mostly wandered around, trying to figure out what to do with my new life. I eventually came across some fresh recruits undergoing training themselves, and noticed a particular half-elf with red hair. ~~Now you’re probably going to hear it from your aunt, so I might as well tell you that the main reason I initially pursued your mother was because she was a redhe~~ *I can’t imagine he or she would like knowing that; no more than I’d like to know why my Dad thought my Mother was worth the mon-* I wound up talking to her, and for whatever reason, she agreed to go on a date with me. *Particularly surprising since she’s about a foot taller than me, give or take.* Didn’t learn too much about each other, but we enjoyed each other’s company enough that we continued to see each other. A few days later, my squad was given its first assignment: to find a group of legionnaires that went missing in the Wastes. Given 24 hours to prepare, I met up with your mother, and hoping to help her out in training, I gave her a couple of spare energy grenades I had. Meeting up with the rest of my squad, we then met Eirika- she rapidly switched back and forth between disdain and affection towards Augustus, which was confusing. From there, we met with an orc named Cookie, the unit’s chef. To celebrate our first mission, he wound up giving us a bunch of blood pies, mostly intended for Zemek. After we got the rest of our affairs in order, we journeyed into the wastes. \n\n###First Contact:\nWe encountered various undead on our way to the missing legionnaires, losing none of our own men. The details about the fights aren’t terribly important, but I will say this: should you ever come across a black orb dropped by an undead champion, don’t pick it up with your bare hands, unless you want to be possessed. After a few days of travel, we saw a group of people and warhorses. At first, we figured they were the guys we were looking for, so we rode towards them. However, as we drew closer, we noticed a pile of bodies at their feet, donned in legion gear. Augustus came up with a quick plan of engagement (Dent would retrieve the horses, the rest would fight) and we moved in. Now, as a quick word of advice, never let the Paladin or the fighter come up with a plan; unless they have training and extensive experience, their plans will get you killed. Additionally, make sure that in the event you order somebody to do focus on another task in a fight (say, retrieving horses), make sure they understand that, if things go wrong for the combatants, *they’re supposed to help*. Now, we were somehow able to repel the undead without a single casualty, so after retrieving the horses and dead legionnaire’s equipment, we returned to the fort- Khan was waiting for us at the gates. Now, apparently no Private had ever returned from a mission that far into the wastes, so we weren’t exactly expected to survive. For this feat, we received 20 days of downtime, which could be used to do anything or go anywhere, provided we were back at base by the end of the 20 days. \n\n###Orcish Food, Advice, and Fights:\nThe first day of R&amp;R was probably the most notable. After being debriefed, we stopped by the mess hall and grabbed some food. Not long after, my jaw locked up due to an illness I had contracted- now, Zemek thought I was gagging at the food Cookie made. As such, the orc forced my jaw open, and poured Orcish cuisine down my throat, which somehow cured my illness (I’ve since developed a taste for the cuisine). After curing me, his attention then turned to Augustus; believing his “relationship” to be in a sad state, Zemek offered the Paladin some advice, which he took. While I’d rather not go into specifics, nothing short of a miracle caused it to work. Several hours later, we retired to our bunks- at some point in the night, a group of other orcs came into our barracks, and attempted to attack Zemek. A fight broke out between our barracks and the Orcs, which caused officers to come in to break it up. As punishment, both sides were made to clean up the shitpits at the fort- your mother heard that I’d returned around this time and *was* going to embrace me, but was deterred by the smell.\n",

The party had grabbed it from the corpse of a Planet of the Apes style interdimensional gorilla after they’d bribed the local volcano god to burn down his fort and free the human prisoners. That’s not the interesting part though. The interesting part had to do with penmanship.\n\nI like to keep my magical items written down on index cards. Usually I instruct my players to jot down a brief item description and a room number from the megadungeon complex (e.g. “+1 breastplate, Room #203”). That way we can easily reference where the item in question came from if we’ve got after-the-fact rules questions. Unfortunately, no one had bothered to write down “Lord Darrulm’s sword” on that particular card. Instead, as we shuffled through the big stack o’ loot, oohing and ahhing over the bottles of rare wine and silver ingots and other pirate booty, we came across this oddity: “tlkeen longsword.”\n\nThe game ground to a halt.\n\nWhere did this strange thing come from? Where had we picked it up? It was important enough to warrant its own card, so surely it must be an item of significance. The group passed the card around, looked through our notes for an explanation, and tried desperately to remember what the hell a ‘tlkeen’ was. I told my players to price out the rest of the haul and move on to a nice session of pencils and paychecks while I dug through my binder, trying to track the origins of this bizarre weapon. **[MFW](http://newboards.theonering.net/forum/gforum/perl/gforum.cgi?do=post_attachment;postatt_id=3653;)**.\n\nIt wasn’t until the last of my pals was heading home that I made my breakthrough. I ran out of the house as he was pulling away, shoes and wintry conditions be damned. I made the international sign for “roll down your window” like a crazy person.\n\n“It was a plus symbol!”\n\nDude looked at me like I’d been hit with the “does nothing but babble incoherently” result on ***[confusion](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/confusion/)***.\n\n“The tlkeen longsword! It wasn’t a ‘t’ at all. It was a +1 keen longsword!”\n\nHe laughed. I laughed. My toes lost feeling. As a group, we collectively resolved to be more careful of our penmanship in the future.",
