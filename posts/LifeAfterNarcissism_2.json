        "text": "Damn, some shit went down this weekend, and it's not the first time. Nex went out of her way (again) to persuade her own daughter to \"be nice and forgive\" the ex friend who was also NPD and BPD, who caused our daughter pain, trauma, depression, ptsd, trust issues, confusion, self esteem issues, anxiety, etc. All the shit.\n\nBut the nex can't see what she's doing. Our daughter is pissed. She sees this as her mom siding and championing this terrible little shithead...instead of her own daughter. The nex has been tricked into thinking that this girl is the victim. WTF!\n\nThe nex is building her own coffin, nails, and hammering them in herself. Our 4 kids are angry with her, confused about all of it, but their eyes are open. No question about it that their mom isn't a mom. Isn't a good person. Doesn't have any care for anyone but herself. Only does things that make her feel good about her terrible decisions.\n\nSeriously, the nex is being manipulated by my daughter's old abuser. It's bananas.\n\nProud of our daughter though, she's not taking her mom's shit. She told her that this girl \"is my trauma\". She told her she didn't care that this girl was \"dealing this so much stuff\".\n\nThis whole thing is so mussed up. I stopped a while back encouraging them to visit their mom. I also told them I wasn't going to encourage them to do that anymore. It is so sad. More than sad. I don't know what the word is. Devastating maybe. Heartbreaking. \n\nThe nex seriously has no idea. My daughter told me that the whole time she was telling her mom she didn't care about this girl, and that she was the cause of her trauma, that she doesn't deserve any of her, that she gave her everything and was betrayed, her mom just blew it all off. Like, \"I know, I know, but maybe you could just be nice...\"\n\nSo interesting how this is a mirror to what the nex did to me. What a mess!",

        "text": "  \n\nToday I want to talk about mistakes that I made that kept me in the toxic relationship a lot longer than I should have been. I also want to talk about lies that I believed that kept me there lot longer. Tw about lies , These are lies that I told myself to  gaslight myself and lies that were told to me. The point of this is not to Victim blame but help clear up the fog that comes with these types of relationships. \n\nMistake number 1) I did not listen to myself or him. I was with my person for a year and few weeks. During the first seven months, while I was being lovebombed and devalued, I was like do I really want to be with this person, I ignored all the red flags. Once I realized that I had feelings for who he pretended to be, That is when the abuse ramped up. I did not listen to him. He would often tell on himself, My job makes relationships too hard, ( I should have asked how many relationships are you in besides me and your wife. \n\nLie number 1. I am not his type. After the breakup, he sent me a sleazy pornographic photo of a sex worker, It was meant to imply that this was his type. If you have a type you have a type and there is nothing wrong with that. However, if your toxic person is changing types in the middle of the relationship , its about one thing only control. And conforming to their will. Post breakup if they are changing types and broadcasting it to you , its about two things, taking a shot at the former relationship and gaslighting themselves into believing if they switch types that they can bury their feelings for the past relationship. \n\nMistake 2) in my feelings. When your in your feelings it is a great feeling but sometimes when we are in our feelings we are blind to obvious red flags, and when this happens we are more susceptible to abuse and blatant lies. Ex. I am divorced … she does not get me like you do. If she does not get you like I do, there should be no reason to triangulate the two of us. \n\nMistake number 3 Relationship jumping, Three months after the stalking , I started talking to a doctor I met online. , It was good for myself esteem, he was kind of cute, But for some reason , I could not develop any romantic feelings for him , and barely like him as a friend. He needed a lot of help always down on himself, We got into a argument, He told me that he has a boyfriend, and he is flirting hardcore online with ten other guys. And he called me a whore but we can still be friends.  Blocked immediately, and went NC. After that I realized several things, I needed to work on myself and figure out my triggers and my mistakes. I did not grieve the last relationship, I needed to work on myself. Big time. \n\nLie 2. He will change. Cluster Bs are never going to give their all to anyone but themselves. \n\nLie 3 Maybe it was me. If they can not be there for you but expect you to be there for them. RED FLAG\n\nMistake 4 lower my boundaries, I allowed my boundaries to be crushed, if I had stronger boundaries this proably would not have happened.\n\nMistake 5 I call anti stalking. Post breakup, I withdrew from my life. I was cautious about what I posted, blocked all mutals. I was so scared of him coming back that I was hypervilgant about not sharing anything with anyone. I realized that as long as I take precautions, that shutting myself off from life is no way to live. I am just a lot more careful now about all aspects of my life and celebrating my accomplishments. \n\nMistake 6 breaking NC to call him out on ALL the lies that I uncovered. This one is tricky. Did I expect a reaction from him. No I did not. Did I expect an apology. No I did not. Here is why I label it a mistake, I fought back and unmasked him and set up anti smear campaign, Our mutals know enough that he would foolish to try and smear me. This was reactionary, because It was awlful yr and than roughly four months of his juvenile stalking. I wanted it done and over with. The only one to completely shut the door was to sink to his level. I know it was the right thing, Even if it felt wrong. \n\nMistake 7 projections . I let him project a lot of his feelings of inadequacies and short comings on to me. \n\nLie and mistake. Should I settle and was I asking to much. This one is a mistake and lie . I know complicated, It was not expecting him to be perfect or him drop on one knee, I was expecting realness, honesty , love and compassion on a constant basis, not when it suited him. So while I was in it I gave more and he gave less. It was exhausting. And crushed me. \n\nThere you go my mistakes and lies that I believed hopefully this helps you .",

        "text": "I (24 f) was only a kid when I first started dating my toxic ex (23 m) and experienced emotional abuse for years during our constant on and off relationship. Fast forward to new years, 2020, I got into a fight with him, dumped him for the last time, and blocked him on everything. I explored who I was as a person without him, because I had built my entire personality around him. I got into a relationship sometime in the same year after COVID lockdown was over, but my ex still messages me from time to time. I used to regularly talk to him even if we weren't dating before I met my now partner. For awhile, things were good, I always wondered how things went for him, but was just fine keeping him out of my life. Now, he's messaged me and I didn't stop myself from messaging back on an app I didn't block him on. It was just friendly conversation at first, but then he admitted he had feelings for me again. I know my worth now, and will never like him in that way again, I was just being nice, and reminded him that I am very happy and very much in love with my now partner and set my boundaries out of respect of myself and my partner. He understood, and we message less now. But why do I even still bother messaging him, especially after all he put me through? I've heard of trauma bonding, but is that the reason I still message him back? My partner knows I started talking to him again, but I told them I was probably going to block him after his confession of having feelings for me. I don't understand why I am doing this to myself, and why I feel the need to continue talking to him even just as a friend.",

        "text": "My ex narc is a 23 year old guy and he gave me the silent treatment for nearly 6 months straight! I know this was the silent treatment because I was frantically texting him begging him for a reason trying to work out what I had done wrong and he completely ignored my existence. Then randomly one night he calls and texts me on a different platform just days after I blocked him everywhere and stopped contacting him! In these texts he was hoovering me, begging me to see him etc as he wants to apologise in person, playing on my empathic side by talking about his depression and suicidality. I agreed to meet him, and I somehow ended up sleeping with him. I found out he has a new main supply he has been seeing as well (he has conveniently told her I’m crazy)and other supplies meaning he lied to me and other women. When I confronted him because I was shocked and confused (I really thought he was sincere in his reasonings of meeting up… idiotic I know he is just so convincing) he said he thought I had changed, blocked me and is silent treatmenting me again! What is the purpose of this? Is this quite a common experience for those in relationships with NPDs? How have people coped with similar experiences, I feel so confused even though it’s happened so many times before I feel as though each time is worse",

The man described how he has always felt a bit of an outsider / socially awkward and has low self esteem / doesn't easily open up to people.\n\nThis is how I have felt for such a long time, and also what my ex mirrored to me to make me fall for him. It was like watching a copy of the persona he presented to me, but then a genuine version. I felt so sad for the guy and I could relate so much. I felt his loneliness and he seemed to be really a type of person I could genuinely fall for of course if I got to know him better. He seemed kind, shy, a bit introverted but so sweet. This made me realise how much I thought my ex was to me, but it was all a fake and a lie. He knew exactly how to get to me, I must say, great acting very well done. And now I don't miss him but I was so happy to feel like I finally found that person. \n\nAnd so angry with him, I mean he must have sensed my loneliness and took advantage of that in the most cruel way. I could never imagine doing that to the man in the video, you see a persons pain then abuse that. It's about time I got angry, I have only felt sadness until now. I need to get myself back out there, there are people around who will appreciate me and it's not him for sure. I can be a wonderful partner for a man who would know how to appreciate me and who could actually SEE me.",

You can check out my other posts if you’d like from when I was still in my worst stages of grieving. Long story short, I am nearly 100% positive that she was a covert narcissist all along.

All in all, though she meets every other criteria for a covert narcissist, her post breakup activity has not been as expected (not being unnecessarily cruel and actually showing some remorse). This is confusing me.\n\nFor one thing, she took a lot of sentimental stuff that had no value but had everything to do with our relationship on the day she left. Other than necessities, she prioritized gifts I gave her, including a stuffed animal I gave her only a month ago. When I caught her and she chose him, she dragged out the process of moving for an unbearably long time. They had an apartment since the day she moved out, but for some reason, she continually made excuses for not getting her stuff. I started to pressure her about it and she finally took a load of things one day, and then another a few days later, and after many cancellations, she got the rest out of here yesterday. She has been in minimal contact but still makes contact. I had asked for a sentimental necklace back that belonged to my mother. She failed to bring it back twice, claiming to not know where it is, although we both know it is in her jewelry box. I saw it before she left. She also never offered her ring back, but I didn’t ask.\n\nToday she asked about her birth certificate. I thought she had it already, but I found it in an unexpected place. I told her I had it and that I could drop it off at her work. She sent me a text with a smiley face and said she would just stop by to get it and to give me the necklace once she finds it.\n\nIt’s starting to feel like this is on purpose. I know her new life with this guy is a huge downgrade compared to what I gave her, maybe she is regretting this? She seems to be leaving an open line of communication and trying to be friendly, even after I exposed her and told her that I believe she is a narcissist, which I thought would send her running for the hills. Maybe I made a mistake when we said our final goodbyes though. I told her then that I was sorry for my part in everything, even though I did nothing, and I hope she will be happy and that I forgive her. She cried a little when I said that. At this point I am having trouble figuring out if this was a permanent discard, if she is trying to keep me on the hook in case it doesn’t work out, or if this was all a game from the start to try and come back to me once I’ve learned my lesson. I just want to be prepared. She hasn’t blocked me on anything or even I unfriended me. She hasn’t taken her relationship public yet. She hasn’t even told her family, apparently. \n\nAm I making it worse by acting like I am OK and that I forgive her? Should I have been mean?

When I wasn't cleaning, I just kind of zoned out or scrolled reddit.\n\nI literally don't know how to have fun anymore or what I even enjoy doing. Any activity I enjoyed as a child is now triggering for me as an adult as my parents turned any hobby or interest into something I had to be the best at. They literally sucked all the joy out of me. I dread work ice breakers and am in constant awe of my colleagues who have all these great hobbies and interests outside work. I avoid the Monday coffee pot talk like the plague so I don't have to say my weekend activities consisted of driving my daughter to her activities and deep cleaning the baseboards.\n\nCan anyone else relate? Has anyone successfully found ways to reintroduce enjoyable hobbies and activities without it being so triggering?",

The intuitive ability to see a narc for who they are, when everyone else either doesn't believe you or see it until it's too late. But after healing, you'll find you're even more perceptive towards them than normal ppl. Being the family scapegoat, who bore the brunt of so much abuse, maybe I was built differently to begin with in that I was naturally more perceptive, which was what made me their target? Anyways. \n\nMy single Nmom surrounded herself with enablers, so I was surrounded only by adults who fell for my mom's outside mask, believing she was this super great, sacrificial person with no fault. All they would tell me was how great she was, not aware of her hidden abuse behind closed doors and telling me how I should feel \"grateful\" for her. The gaslighting, the years of being taught as a child that abuse was \"love\". The years of being conditioned to always feel \"less than\", indebted, and \"grateful\" to my abusers. Gaslighted to feel like if I am bullied, the abuser is always right and my experiences and pain are inherently unreal or invalid. \n\nIf I heal one day and become \"normal\" (which is my motivation now), I will always remain distinct. I will always stand out for not having a biological family, having to find a \"chosen family\" instead. That and also having to find solace and content with just being me, for me. Outside of a trauma support group, no one will quite get my experiences and some may even not believe me. Yet, at the end of the day, I don't need anyone else to validate my existence, except for me.  \n\nThose dating a narc may have voluntary got with on by accident. But for me, for the first 20 years of my life, I had no reality or existence other than being abused. I'm finally allowed to be ME now, which is a sigh of relief, with everything I've had to learn at such a young age. I have strength. I have hope.",

Keep in mind, I was the one who ended it, not her but shes making it seem like she left me. \n\nYes I've called her a whore and truthfully I got really toxic in the relationship towards the end. \n\nShe says I was the meanest but she has always been mean to me from the beginning, if I try to talk to her about something, ask her to do something, and she even got mad at me that I was mad she used my card without permission. \n\nI just always end up having to hold my emotions in because I knew it would get no where and it would end up with me just letting it go and begging her to unblock me or most of the time, with the \"problem\" being sweapt under. \n\nShe says im obsessed with her when something shady happens and every time I feel like she manipulates what's going on and always has an excuse of why such and such happens. \n\nThese are her recent attempts to try and contact me. \n\nThank you for showing me how trashy you were as a person, now I realize that I was never the one with the problem, the problem was always you. You criticized me so much and called me a whore and that’s because that’s the only way you liked women, I’m so happy I don’t know anything about you, I thank God for having the courage to get out of this relationship. \n\nI was never going to write to you but I feel such courage for everything you did to me, you are the meanest person I could have ever met, no one ever managed to hurt me so much and get away with it \n\nI see that you didn't care about anything, I'm not surprised, you never loved me and you only wanted to hurt me, you were obsessed with fucking up my life. I was hoping you would change and I was wrong, I always hoped you would be a better person, but you only disappointed me, you threw everything away for your whims, it's so easy for you to do your life as if it didn't hurt you at all. \n\nKeep in mind everytime Ive tried to end the relationship this is what happens. \nShell block me, I'll go no contact, and then shell try to contact me by either sending these kinds of messages or trying to love bomb me. \n\nShe's admitted she never says sorry for anything and I have to beg her everytime, and when she does apologize they're very bland and always has a \"but.\"",

        "text": "So I recently got into a new relationship, and she is wonderful, but I’m still terrified that she is going to get tired of me and leave. I’ve been working through my triggers and trauma responses through trauma therapy ever since I escaped my nex in 2021, but the waves of anxiety are still intense and overwhelming. It’s especially exhausting because they have been happening for no reason once a week or two. \n\nYesterday was especially bad. For the whole day, I fought off intrusive thoughts until I couldn’t anymore. I kept myself from asking for help/reassurance until last night when I was on the verge of crying my soul out. TLDR, she told me that she wasn’t doing mentally well too, and said as much as she wanted me to go into detail on what was wrong ((she knew I was on the verge of crying)), she wouldn’t allow it so her mental health wouldn’t drop more. \n\nI wasn’t and am certainly not mad at her for it. In fact, I’m proud of her for setting that boundary for herself. I asked if I could anything for her because I wanted to support her, but there wasn’t anything, and reading that KILLED me. I didn’t realize it at the time, but that was a moment when I needed reassurance from her. I wanted her to hear me and tell me that she isn’t tired of me ((like my nex constantly was..they would go into detail of how much of a burden I am on them and showed me that I wasn’t good enough)), nor is she going anywhere. But my walls went up and I told her I was gonna give her space for the night and that I loved her, and I cried for god-knows-how long until my body went weak, wishing that all of it would stop and damning my nex for making me so weak and helpless. \n\nI’m SO scared….I want to tell my girlfriend that and go into detail about my nex because I don’t think she fully understands how traumatizing it was for me, but I don’t want to be another source of her problems. I don’t want the reassurance to be constant and I don’t want to burden her, but the thoughts and anxiety are eating me alive, and I can’t calm down",

        "text": "Has anyone had issues with their therapist invalidating them or just not “getting” that they are dealing with a manipulative, abusive person? My nex was covert so he was good at pretending he didn’t mean to be hurtful. He would apologize for lying and then lie again. He would make little jabs and put downs that were subtle enough to make you wonder if you were overreacting. He would “remember” things happening in a completely different way. He violated my boundaries and engaged in the classic lovebomb, devalue, discard, and hoover cycle. \n\nMy therapist knows the vast majority of what he did in the short span of four months, which was pretty fucking terrible. She knows he sexually violated me and says it’s valid for me to label it r*pe (he said months later on that it was an accident so it’s hard to tell. Pretty sure he was gaslighting me, though). I’ve told her he was well aware he broke my trust and my heart. Only for him to act like he wanted to get back together then call things off— but I had to reach out to him to find that he was no longer interested despite him knowing for a while he didn’t want to date me again. Two weeks later, he was in a relationship. Besides all this, he’s a shit person in general.\n\nDespite her knowing all of this, she decided to insert her opinion and say she “thinks he did care.” I told her that he might care, but not the way a normal person would. Somehow feeling like he cared but was an asshole is supposed to help me heal or something. \n\nShe brought up how he apologized and I told her that he never gave me proper apologies and always repeated the same behavior. She asked if maybe he was actually just trying to make me feel better because he knew it mattered to me. I had told him how my ex rarely apologized, so he probably knew I wouldn’t put up with him not saying sorry if he did something shitty. She said she was worried that my way of thinking he didn’t care was harmful and was concerned it would turn into a lesson about how men are bad and the world is a scary place. I told her I believe he is manipulative and she said you can only be manipulative if you’re doing it intentionally. Then she looked up the definition of manipulation and read me the aspects and asked me if the applied and 75% did. I’m pretty upset. If someone had opened my eyes earlier, I probably would have left. But to have her still thinking he’s *just* an asshole and actually cared feels like a betrayal. I kind of felt like I was being gaslit by her. It took me so long to accept that he was wearing a mask and is manipulative (even if he’s not outright thinking of ways to hurt me). And for my own therapist to not get that is super invalidating.",

Isolation and abuse are all I've ever known. \n\nI've attracted malignantly narcissistic bullies as my \"friends\" since middle school and narcs gravitated towards me in high school. It's been almost 2 years of college, and I only woke up to understanding that I was a victim of narcissistic abuse this past December, although it's been a chain of events and realizations since the middle of last June. \n\nI attracted narcissistically abusive lab partners 3 classes in a row, with my very last (4th) lab class being my first time with healthy people. In my volunteering last semester, I attracted a really narcissistic clerk who tried to get close to me on the pretense of \"supervising\". I had no boundaries and she ended up crossing my boundaries by touching me and dumped any extra work on me she didn't feel like doing. \n\nI'm done and don't interact with people like that anymore. But I've had to spend so much time this past break doing the inner work with trauma symptoms, re-parenting, and healing. I've also almost had to re-wire my mind. After so much trauma, it's almost like our brains have been built differently. I feel like there really is something inherently different about those of us who have gone through immense abuse and trauma since childhood. But I'm learning to not find abuse \"familiar\", trust my gut instincts when reading ppl, surround myself with the right types; love, respect, and prioritize myself and center all of my interactions around that first and foremost. It's difficult, bc I still live with the narcissist (my Nmom) and have a year or more before I can move out. Today I went into trauma responses trying to test my ability to read ppl and pick good ppl to sit next to in class. Sometimes I feel on top of it, healed, and self-confident; other times I feel battered and soul-less, like an abuse victim. I'm still learning to validate my own emotions and my own perspectives. Today wasn't easy, but knowing I'm working through 20 years of being mentally hijacked by the pyscho b\\*tch of an Nmom I had, I know I'm already doing a good job.",

At the age of 16, I made a friend not knowing what was to come next.\n\n At first it seemed as if we had an understanding with one another. She’d invite to places, stay up on call late at night, compliment me, made me feel as if I was special and kept me close like her little pet. Her true colors gradually showed, starting by bullying others and justifying why she’s in the right.\n\nShe made new friends that could pay more attention to her than me and worship her, but then she bullied a friend I’ve made out of the group. I was scared that she would hurt me, but paired with my outcasted friend to call her out and leave her.\n\nShe still wouldn’t have given any of us peace, and basically cyberbullied the two of us and our new small group, she just couldn’t let us go, she couldn’t let ME go. When I was 17, she had her minions cyber bully me so that I can call her myself and I had no one to turn too. \n\nThe adults I grew up with were very abusive, so telling them this person was harassing me felt futile. I was the manipulated to be her friend, and she fed me more lies about my group so that I can stay with her. I ruined the one bond I’ve ever felt safe in, and I’m sure a part of me wanted more of her admiration.\n\n\nNow at 19, I’ve decided to break her off seeing that she hasn’t changed. She tormented me for years, knowing I had no power in a dysfunctional environment and invaded my boundaries as an aromantic person by flirting and guilting me that I’m a “robot” who can’t feel love.\n\n\nShe also befriended discord creeps who would prey on others in her group, but she wouldn’t listen to them  unless the groomers went against her majesty. I blocked, deleted, basically said Sayanara to any contact I’ve had with her. It’s better to have the one true friend that made me feel safe for years, over one that’s materialistic, a bitch , and made me feel even more lonely",

        "text": " \n\nNarcissists see people as objects they use to meet their needs. When you no longer add value and serve a purpose to them, a narcissist starts to let go of the grip and slowly discards you. You may think your relationship with a narcissist seems good, and then the next day, you are thrown to the side as if you never mattered to them. You might think you’re responsible for it, but it’s always about the narcissist. So, what makes a narcissist discard you for good? And why do they do that?\n\n**1: You were difficult for them to control.**\n\nThey are all about control, they think they own you and they have a fear of losing it. Once they sense that you are too difficult to control, they feel threatened; they become frustrated about it and sometimes react with anger.\n\nWhen narcissists can no longer control you, they’ll try to control how others see you. Before putting you away like a toy, they’ll poison the minds of others with anyone they influence, including your close family and friends. All the false information will feel unfair, no matter what stays above it.\n\n**2: You no longer fuel their ego.**\n\n**N**arcissists have inflated egos and see themselves as superior to others; they strive to be the best most accomplished and beyond competent in their field. They must be right, have the last word, and always be in control. Fueling their ego may be in the form of attention, validation, and compliments.\n\n**Continue reading here:** [https://www.bignama.com/10-reasons-why-narcissists-discard-you-for-good/](https://www.bignama.com/10-reasons-why-narcissists-discard-you-for-good/)",

Looking back I  notice small things that were kinda digs at me like saying my legs are werid after I told them I fell from free rock climbing and broke my fible bone and it's been stiff and hard to rehab it. I dismissed it and thought I was just being over senstive. \n\nAt the begining of the friendship they were kind and helpful. They take their time to help me with my CV to apply to a job because I haven't worked in a couple of years because I been to therapy due to my anxiety. \nThey also help my partner their work CV because my partner works in the same field as my friend. \n\nWe put chocolate in their letter box to say thank you. \n\nI once gave them a covid test because they were concern they had covid and it was before you could buy covid test from the shops. I asked my partner if they could get some form work. I put it in their letterbox. \n\nMy friend didn't do the same thing, like gave anything in thanks, looking back.\n\nSo....this unfolded by starting project together a reading class online for kids once a week and we take turns once a week to teach.\nHowever at the very begining my friend told me to make more post on the socail media page so I thought oh snap! I better pull my socks up and do more. As time went by I notice I was doing everything, for example posting socail media content from videos to reminder posts for my reading class and my friend's as well. I was creating the event pages for my friend too.\nAfter a while I assume my friend felt guilty and told me they will do their own event page for the reading class. Though...after time...week by week it slowly went from posting it at the begining of the week to 3 days or 2 days before the reading class. I would find myself reminding them which was frustrating on my end.\n\nI know they have a full time job and it's full on from what they told me. However! they go on dates with people  during their  work week. So I saw it as they have the time  to make a event page. It doesn't take much effort.\n\nThen one day my friend told me \"You can teach the kids the fundamentals of reading and I will teach them the dirty tricks\"\nI felt afarid to speak up and say no, so I was kinda like ...\"oh yep...\". \nDeep down I was furious.\n\n\nWe did a competition to win this book on our social media page to get more followers. I thought it was best if one the current kids who go to our class wins, but my friend said no and told me to chose this person because they look poor looking at their Facebook page and they will join the class. Well....they never joined the class and! I had to pay for sending the parcle which was $18 and my friend never paid half. \n\n\nAnyway, I was contacted by a kindergarten to  do a reading class for the kids in person..They asked me directly not through our reading class socail media. I thought to involved my friend  since I felt a bit scared to do it all by myself and I have socail anxiety.\n\nMy friend wanted to do it for free. However I wanted us to get paid, because it's the cost of driving,petrol and time put into a class.\nThe person who contacted me to do the class we will name them Rory, insisted to pay us $40. I told my friend this and they said ask them if it's $40 each? so I did and Rory replied in email \"you can spilt that up between you and your friend\".\nMy friend  was annoyed and told me I should've negotiate better.\nI felt ashamed and it kept going through my mind over and over \"You should've negotiated better\".\nI felt ashamed and guitly that I did something wrong some how.\n\nI pretty much orgainsed the whole event but I kept letting my friend make choices like what date to do it at. Instead of me chosing.\n\nMy friend told me they will email me flyers to print for the class but didn't, I had to remind them.\n\nI asked them  to do the invoice payment because at least they can do one thing. Well...they forgot and I had to remind them.\n\nWe did have a phone call the night before the reading class because I was really anxious to do the class. So my friend suggested she will do the intro and the health and safety and the warm class. Which I did appreciate that.\n\nDoing the live class in person went well.\nThough I notice I taught the kids and they stand on the side taking photos and that was it, where as my partner helped out a lot more with the kids.\n\nAfter the reading class Rory asked if we do it again, my friend jump in and said yes I said we will think about it. \n\nAs we were getting ready to leave I had this odd feeling from observing my friend they weren't happy and seem distance. I didn't felt at the time to ask what was up.\n\nThe messages between each other drop dramatically. \n\nI message them and they didn't get back to me until 7 days and 10mins before class started through zoom. I was so anxious that they were upset with me that it bothered me for days I even spoke to my therapist about it. \nI said this in my message quote \"I was thinking because we might have new kids in the class, it would be good to keep on the fundamental reading steps, because then we are consistent in our teaching of the fundamentals, help them to reinforce good habits and in the long run their art will improve. I recalled going back to the basic at school with one of my teachers and I started to improve heaps again.\"\n\nThey message me this 10 mins before class started.\n\" morning! let's talk after class - I've got a packed weekend so I can't meet in person, sorry\"\n\n And we'll I notice they worked on the fundamentals because I saw their written papers through zoom.. So obviously they saw my message but it didn't show it was \"read\" but didn't bother to message back! \n  \nAnyway, we spoke before our reading class started, I asked if everything is okay? they said yes, and seemed happy.\nI asked are you sure? and my friend said yep.\n\nI asked to make sure  \"So we are okay? because I notice I message you but you didn't got back to me. \"\n\n they said\" oh yes, I was telling myself to reply back to you.\"\n\nI then asked \"So if anything happened between us, you will tell me\"?\n\n and my friend  responded \"oh yes, you would know\".\n\nAfter the class we had a chat through zoom about reading class, I asked how their week was and my friend mention how they been on dates with guys.\nI thought to myself! I knew it! they were having a grand old time and me was worried about them and I was constantly try to remind my friend to do things!!! for the reading class. And she is doing none thing!!!\n\nBesides the reading class before I pulled away from it.\nThey  seem to become distance, at the time they were going to therapy and I notice they suddenly stop talking to me about their work problems or family life issues or their greif with their parent that passed away. The reason why it bothered me is because I realised that they were only talking to me about their problems and getting vaildation from me, I didn't realised this  at the time. I thought what I was doing was being a good friend I didn't notice I was being used. Well that's how it feels anyway.  It was only when they start going to therapy that they didn't bothered to talk to me accept for the reading class. I was the one that suggested them  to go to therapy because they told me they would wake up anxious every morning to go to work.  I felt sorry for them as I have intense anxiety myself so I have them this calming tea and put it in their letterbox.\nI feel a bit sad by this and I do feel a bit used like I was \"therapist\"at the time before my friend went to therapy.\n\n\n\nI eventually built the strength to message them this because I was starting to build resentment and bitterness with the whole reading class and doing everything alone. \n\nI said this \n\"Hi,\nHow are you? I haven't heard from you for a while, so I hope everything is going well in your neck of your woods.\nI've been thinking about reading class and what I want to focus on with teaching, I've noticed there seems to be a high demand for reading classes of history. \nI got this feedback from Rory from Kindergarten and what the parents were telling him, what they were looking for. As well that one girl in the reading class we did, how the mother asked if we do anything else. I also thought it was important since there is lost of history knowledge here .As I've discussed this with my aunt who is teacher in socail studies at high school. So I feel strongly and passionate to help the kids with the history, as it can be hard to seek resources and teach yourself.\nI would prefer to focus on teaching the history for a small group of kids so they can get the attention they need. I don't want to over-commit myself to too many classes and would like to step away from the free reading classes, so I can focus solidly on the fundamental history reading class.\nIt will take a lot of time of research and finding what will be easy for the kids to digest from looking through adult history fundamental books, as and doing it kinda like a course so they can take in the information about what they need to learn.\nI do value our friendship and what we've done with reading class and I appreciate your help and your kindness you've shared with me, it means a lot.I would like to continue to spend time with you going forward. I know recently the time we've spent together has been around Reading Class and I don't want to lose you as a friend, or not see you anymore. Can we still orgainse to me up, for example once a month kinda thing.\"\n\nThey reply back with this\n\"Awww babe\n\nThis reads like you spent ages thinking about how to explain your decision - you don't need to!\nOf course we're friends beyond art class you goose.\nYes, if this is what you want to do, then do it\nI'll take over reading class and see how long i want to keep it going, cos it's not a forever thing for me, either.\nAnd flip yes we must meet up once a month for a gossip etc\"\n\nI replied back and felt a bit defences when they said to me \"you spent ages thinking about how to explain your decision\"\nWhich wasn't really the case it was more to do with me being very clear because of my past challenges with friends.\n\nI replied back and said\noh, I was trying to find the words to express and explain myself. ☺️\nI didn't want to hurt your feelings or anything like that, that all.\n\nYou okay to do it alone with the reading  class?\nI don't know if your upset or bothered me pulling out?\nI just want to make sure you are okay.\n\nYes excatly drinks.\noh must ask why was that dude a dud?\nwas he creepy?\n\nMy friend responded and said\n\n\"Nah I'm not upset. Like I said, this isn't forever for me, too. But I'd like to keep going for a bit, so I will.\nNo, just a raging disappointment. He cancelled a date TWICE last Sunday, both times only letting me know half an hour beforehand. Then promised to make it up to me but ignored me for a week. Basically slow fading me.\nSo he is no more.\n\n\n I then made a post on the reading class social media page I'm leaving and I said this \n\"\nReading friends, we have some news we'd like to share with you. A year ago SevenSailorRumcat and their ftiend started Reading class to share a love of reaidng with  kids. Now, our lovely SevenSailorRumCat is taking a new reading  career path, and will be leaving. They will be well missed for all the hard work they have done for this community, and we wish them the best. If you want to contact or follow them,, you can do so on them Instagram. \n\nReading Class will continue with your tutor with SevenSailorRumCat friend , and a new schedule of classes will be made available soon.\nWith the messaging. \n\n\nI let my friend read it before posting it and they said it was fine. \nI did edited later on and added hard working because I was a bit pisst off. \n\nAbout a month after my birthday we meet up and they went on about the guy they dated and how the dude keep cancelling on them and they were angry at about it. But didn't seem angry when expressed it though. \nAnd then their family issues. They said how they haven't done anything with the reading class and it's hard to do it alone. Which I did notice and they haven't done anything with it since.\nI mentioned how I felt sad and lonely doing the reading class and they said to me coldly and very matter of fact \"Well I told you work comes first for me\". \nI was shocked and didn't know how to respond and it was a little off saying goodbye. \nLater on it bothered me so much I didn't even recalled my friend telling me this at the very begining when we started the reading class. I told my sister and partner and they said if was true your friend said that to you, they would know it from me and I be so upset I wouldn't stop going on about it. \n\n\n\nMy friend told me once how they forget to reply to people. It's not personal.\n\nI said \"yeah I notice that, you seem to reply in the evenings.\" After I said that, she suddenly stopped replying to me in the evenings\n\nAt first my friend started from replying to me often to a couple days in-between. Then the days went to a week or 2 weeks, I notice if you send more than one message then they would reply so say 3 messages. But now they don't anymore. \n\n I recalled when it was their birthday last year and I offer we go out for drinks and I did a protrait of them. I do art on the side so I thought it was a nice gift. They seem to really like it. \n\nWhen it was my birthday, they forgot didn't got me anything or said anything. \nWhen we meet a month after my birthday they said they forgot it was birthday and thought buying me a smoothie be okay??? \n\n\n\nMy friend said some things that are odd and I thought maybe it be worth to share to see if it points direction of a narc, I'm asking because I feel so confused, rejected, sad and keep blamming myself I was a bad friend.\n\nMy friend told me how before they reach to the age of 10, they thought they were better than everyone else, but realised that they had no friends. So they started to make friends. \n\nMy sister whom we catch bus from school to home with my friend. My sister pointed out how they found them odd. I asked how? So they made up a example which was say if you brought yourself a t.shirt and say hey look at my new shirt! my friend would be in response \"I don't like that shirt\".\nMy sister explain to me that my friend reminds them Sheldon from the Big Bang tv series. In the sense of how Sheldon isn't aware of socail cues or people emotions.\n\nI asked my other friend about them and they said they always appeared \"smart\". \n\nAnyway my friend told me their longest realtionship is 5 months and how whenever they go out on a date with some dude, they eventually get annoyed with them and complain about them to their friends. Then breaks up with them because they need to get them off them. \nI suggested why not tell them what annoys you then? and my friend said \"Oh no I can't do that\". \n\nThey go on Tinder and date men left, right and centre. They say there is no spark with that person and would happily just drop them like a hot potatoe. They seem I guess confused because they told me how they spoke about this to their sister's husband when they were dating some dude at the time and said there was no spark.\n\nThe hot potatoe examples would be like.\nExample be they dated this guy who is like 6 years younger than them and were going out say a month I said how's your boyfriend? and they said they wouldn't call them there boyfriend.  When I meet them last time they were already looking for guys on Tinder and said that the guy was too touchy and didn't like them stroking their hand. And how they would think they were in trouble by the way there friend told them jokes. \n\nI didn't hear them during Christmas hoildays so I asked to hang out. \nThere they told me how there friend was hooking them up with there friend, but my friend didn't seem that thrill about it. I asked later on how it went they said this \"Yeah! I never met the guy so no worries. I'm just back on tinder having chats there\"\n\nmy response was \n\"oh fair enough won't be odd. Was the dude odd? \n\nOh yep ☺️ have you thought it's just a suggestion like a professional dating set up. So the people help you find someone but with your personatily ? My cousin  did that and now he is getting married. I thought it might help?\n\n\nmy friend response \"No the dude wasn't odd, he looked totally normal. You don't know how these things can be set up if 2 third parties are managing it, so im not fussed. I'm not keen on a professional dating site to be honest. I can get dates, I'm just picky and I know it\"\n\nI repsonse with this but got no response\"2 third parties are managing it? you mean the professional dating? Do you know what you are looking for excatly?maybe we should go by star signs match. So you are Gemini so.... your match would be\"\n\nuntil later on saying it's not there thing. \n\nRegards for a friend being there. \nYeah no. \nEarlier on I told them how I had a hard time with a pervious friend who bullied me badly and wanted to reconnect and I was debating should I? I spoke to them online but they wanted to meet face to face. And how I saw them walking by one time in my car because they came overseas and I live nearby their parents house. \nSo I told my friend how I had these flash backs.\n\nThey didn't reply or responded to that message but the other message they did.\n\nI told them how I was doing EMDR therapy and I broke down crying because a song triggered it and brought back feelings of my parent leaving the family. \nThey said this \"Ohh you ok? Did a bit of a cry help?\"\n\nI replied back and I said I'm okay and explain a bit what was going on..They saw my message and never replied back at all. \nI found a funny picture and sent it to them never replied back. \n\n\nWhat's your thoughts of this friend? \ndo they seem narcisstic or traits of it? \nare they ghosting me? \nwhy would someone use someone for vadilation and just drop them like the a hot potatoe? why help me and be kind to me at the begining and slowly go cold? \nI'm so confused. \n\nAny insights would be appericate and thank you for reading this long message and taking your time to read it as well.",

Happy, confident, respected in my career, pretty, and alive. \n\nI wish I could be rid of this crippling social anxiety that has made me into such a whack job. I don’t even know how to interact with people anymore. I took a new position in my field and the interactions I have had with my co-workers are just pathetic. While my actual clinical work is still quite good, it’s overshadowed by my awkward AF nervousness.  I had a near panic attack during a conversation and I was doing everything in my power to hide it, but there was no getting around it. My brain started to freeze and I felt dizzy. \n\nWhat triggered it was my automatic response to feeling like I had to defend myself. He didnt do anything bullying or attacking, but for some reason my brain and body started shutting down. It was humiliating. I dont even know how to come back from that. He probably thought I was a whack job or a complete moron, or at minimum just totally incompetent. \n\nI have worked so hard to get to where I’m at in my career. What do you even say about that? Oh sorry, dont mind my PTSD, my brain gets stuck in survival mode sometimes and I spontaneously stop functioning.  \n\nI panic thinking about what would happen if I lost this job. I’m raising my son as a single mom and paying my lawyer a billion dollars to get my life back.  I wish I didnt have to fight my own brain on top of it.

It's a serious relationship even though it's been a short while. We knew a lot about each other's lives prior to dating. \n\nNow I'm slowly noticing things about his character as well. He's great in many many ways. He literally treats me like a queen. But only during normal and good times.\n\nTo me his affection seems conditional. It seems like I'll be treated well only if I say yes to him and agree with things. What he feels is reasonable is reasonable. If my needs are not aligned with his, it comes across as unreasonable. \n\nFor a long time I went along with things with fear, but when I finally opened up in a discussion, he lost his calm and said very upsetting things and later apologised. And later was distant with me because I took a week to get back to normal. Now again i ended up apologising for taking offence at his outbursts and again he brought up things from the past disagreements and i had to apologise for them too. Things that i should not be sorry for. They were just differences of opinion. Adults can have different opinions. He doesn't seem understand that. \n\n\nAm i overthinking or could this be some form of unacceptable behaviour? Is this covert narcissism? \n\nSeeking help as this is the first time I'm seeing someone behaviour this way. Came after after reading a lot of articles about silent treatment, stonewalling, narcissism. \n\nBELOW CONTENT MAY BE SKIPPED IF TOO LONG TO READ. \n\nTo read further, many instances are usually one of the below: \n\n- If we have a small disagreement, he goes silent for 2-3 days, uninterested replies and moody. Usually this is resolved by me asking him several times if all is okay and then after several requests he opens up and says what he thinks. He never lashes out or screams etc. It's all civil and polite. But these disagreements are topics that normal people usually just discuss then and there, and clear it out, because they're the small stuff. He says he takes time to think to maintain the calm and think before he says, but even for the smallest topics/disagreements? And until i beg him to open up, he doesn't respond normally to unrelated topics. \n\n- whenever he has things to be grateful about. He always lists his parents, siblings and then me. Always in that order. Which i don't mind. But in some contexts, even though I'm the one who hears him out on things related to work, he would still be grateful to his parents first and then family and then me. Sometimes it seems like he's showing his priority. I question myself if it'll be the same after marriage, and if my needs will always be of lower priority over his family's.\n\n- even though I'm hurting because of something he said, I'm the one apologising and bringing the relationship back on track, all the time.  When he screamed at me once, i told him where and why he was wrong and he seemed to apologise. Only to bring up what i said two weeks later and tell me what i said was wrong. Basically when given criticism on his behaviour, that one time, he did not accept it and turned it on me and i ended up apologising for asking him to be a bit better. \n\n- always says he's the one making most compromises. Randomly. Honestly I'm the one who has and will be too. But i never bring it up because i thought I'm doing it for the best of our interests. I strongly feel he's in delusion that he's making compromises and will bring it.uo later on and that would lead to arguments. \n\n- every small light thing said, he feels like he's being judged and blows it out of proportion when it's just simple words. He says he will change for the better but when somethings pinpointed, it's justified rather than accepted. \n\n- if i don't share the same opinion as him, then the whole cycle of uninterested responses follow the next 2 days. Even if i express my needs, if they contradict his way of living or beliefs, then it's termed as difficult and sometimes these requests and desires also follow with awkward silence the next day. \n\n- and there's some excessive positivity from his, which makes me hesitate to bring up any discussion about the future which may lead to conflicts in opinions.",

        "text": "Hi, \nFor context I am 22F, 3rd year undergraduate \n\nI have as recently as last week cut all contact with my best friend whom I believe now to be a narcissist. I’ve figured out she is one before she realised I had and now I’ve gone and cut all contact. She’s in the midst of a smear campaign against me (recently learned this term from researching narcissism) and I’ve accepted my losses and am focusing on graduating &amp; healing myself. \n\nMoreover, ages 16-20 I was a victim of grooming, domestic abuse, and a bunch of other things by my (older than me ~ 8yrs and female) ex who has been arrested now as I went to the police in the end (it’s how I got out). That ‘relationship’ was with what I believe to be a narcissistic sociopath. It nearly killed me, I re-did 2nd year of uni (and conveniently I can blame it on Covid when people ask me why) and I’ve worked really hard to get to a place where I can be highly functional enough to do my degree and live independently. \n\nAnyway, I meet this girl I’m referring to as my best friend about a year ago. I was finally in a good place with great friends and was no longer depressed. We’re both instantly drawn to one another. In hindsight, it could not be more clear she is a narc. \n\nI clearly have written on my forehead that I’d be the perfect victim. How do I stop ending up in these intense and turbulent relationships with narcs - platonic or romantic? Weirdly, despite my best friend and me both having boyfriends most of our relationship (I’m bi for more context- I am also no longer with said boyfriend), it always felt like me and her were more than friends. I considered us platonic soulmates, and we often joked about having been married in a past life. I’m tired now, and I don’t trust my judgement much anymore because it’s happened twice now I’ve been a narcs supply. I’m getting out at an earlier stage now having realised she’s a narc (about 11 months as opposed to 4 years with my ex) and I’m proud of myself for choosing myself but it still took me 11 months to realise and now she’s taking my other friends with her and I don’t stand a chance. I lost the moment she decided to make me her best friend - and I know she decided because she told me she chose me. \n\nHow do I heal? What is a healthy friendship? Why do i so desperately want to have a single person I can worship above everything else? Why have I only ever felt truly loved and understood by women who treat me with such malice? Why can I not pour energy into myself the way I did for her? Any advice big or small would be appreciated!",

I always thought she was gas lighting, but she really believes the reality she has created for her self.  I have done research, but I am not claiming to diagnose her accurately. \nNot sure if it's a mania, or erotomania, or some other delusional disorder.  She thinks famous people like Elon Musk are following her social media accounts.  She has several accounts where she pay's tribute to ELON....She has developed this behaviour where she actually thinks she is communicating with him and he is paying attention.  (Some weirdo on the other side seems to get off role playing).....\n\nHer theories and behaviour are weird, bizzare and not based in reality.  She refuses any help and will not see a psychologist or doctor of any kind....\n\nShe is filled with grandiose thoughts . Conspiricy theory and WOKE movement are here mantras.  After 4 years of her mental decline, I divorced her in September 22.  She did not contest anything in our divorce,  she didn't show up to any hearings.  She just didn't care.  I moved out in January 2023.  She is unemployed and now faces eviction from the apartment we lived in... Her eviction trial is Friday, 17th....\n\nI expect once evicted she will knock on my door looking for shelter. (We have two kids, I have full custody).  \n\nI tried to pre-empt her by getting a restraining order.  They told me that since She is not violent,  I cannot get a protection order filed.  \n\nI am afraid she will find a way to move in while i am work through convincing my kids to let her stay....  If she does this, is there any legal recourse for getting a guest evicted ?  We are divorced, and she is not 100% well in the head.\nI don't know what resources are available for keeping her away if she is not violent. \nHow do I evict an ex wife from my home if trys to move in?",

This part of the message is for people who are newly out. \n\nFocus on yourself and not what your toxic Ex is doing. Take the energy that you were going to spend on them and spend it on yourself. \n\nIts okay to grieve the relationship and be sad.its part of the journey. Its not okay to romanticize and play the what if game. Here is why , are you perfect . No . Did you make mistakes , Yes. Who is perfect no one , who has not made mistakes. \n\nUnderstand this, you are loved, you are enough. \n\nUnderstand this , a relationship with an unaware cluster b is like a bad movie, You want it to end better and everyone have a happy ending but the truth Is this , it’s a train wreck and there was nothing that you could have done to stop it. That was not your fault.\n\nStay strong. CB come around on holidays not to win you back or woo you, they come around for validation regardless of what form it takes. \n\nHappy Valentines Day\n\nTo the ones that are still in it . \n\nI am sorry for your pain. \n\nYou need to do some hard introspection. Are you really someones valentine, if your getting abused, if your getting gaslight into thinking your self worth is based on their approval.\n\nYou need to ask yourself how are you getting your needs met\n\nYou need to look in the mirror, you are enough. And if your in triangle relationship, What are you actually fighting over, someone they preteneded to be in the beginning.",

I can never tell a lie, I am authentic and have many friends. \n\n[I didn’t mean to make this so long but appreciate your time reading]\n\nI moved to a new town with my long term partner - I didn't know anyone in the town except for a loose family friend connection which I never contacted. I found a Facebook Group for people of my ethnicity (it welcomed people over multiple cities) which was recently put together by a few people who met over Facebook. They found me and I ended up meeting two ladies over dinner.  I was further asked to hang out and go for hikes and more meals. The admins of this group all became close quickly, but I never felt like I fit in - I was much younger and didn’t have kids. However, I enjoyed their company.\n\nAfter about 3 months, I was invited to a lunch where I met N. N was my age, and it was crazy how much we hit it off  (or so I thought).  We became SUPER close SUPER fast. She shared extremely personal things quickly. She talked about herself so much and all her problems. She was a victim in life. She was constantly complaining about something. Some things were really scary - included guns and stalkers, and all sorts of weird situations.\n\nShe constantly talked shit about the ladies of the Facebook group- always putting them down, mocking them, calling them losers, ugly, bad at their job etc. to the point that I had to say “okay, let's stop talking about them.” EVERY TIME I WAS WITH HER THESE WOMEN CAME UP. Obviously this was a huge red flag, but I was so happy to finally have a close friend in this new city and i got used to changing the topic. At a party with these women she came into the bathroom and warned me that one of the girls was talking shit about me. I went home and was shocked and so hurt I cried for hours. Ever since then, I slowly removed myself from the group and thought the shit talking girl was a fake friend. N later told me more stories of others shit talking and I didn't want to surround myself with those types of people.\n\nN did not have Facebook. I was also surprised she did not have any other friends - red flag. She told me she ended it with her previous bestie - and used a very similar story to one of  one of my friendship breakups. \n\nI had a friend I was growing very close to (outside of the FB group) and N said “Make sure you wear our BFF bracelet so she knows you already have a bestie.” She was EXTREMELY possessive. I started feeling like I couldn't breathe but at the same time felt so loved and was flattered by it. \n\nShe was in a relationship of 7 years, but I never met her boyfriend. It was the strangest thing, there were tons of excuses about him not wanting to be around people or he was busy. I hung out with her probably 4-5 times a week, constantly invited him and never actually met him. She didn’t even have a photo with him. \n\nOur friendship lasted for 6 months total, but it put a whirlwind in my “new-city life.” \n\nAbout 4 months into the friendship, and after a couples camping trip that her boyfriend didn't end up coming to, she told me he hit her and that she was breaking up with him. She told me all these scary things about him that I actually felt like he was coming to murder me- I kept a bat by my bed. She told me “please tell me that if I don't break up with him you won't be my friend anymore.” I was on edge for WEEKS; she made me feel like my life was in danger. \n\nWeeks later, after being there for her at the drop of a hat supporting her breakup, there was an incident at her birthday party (which included a few random people from her work and none of the Facebook Group people because she didn't want anything to do with them). After the party, she gas lit me. She shamed me. She told me people thought I was super weird. Feedback I never received before. She was so cruel that I decided to block her. My gut said, this is the end. \n\nLastly, a few months later I am scrolling on Facebook and see a photo of her with the Facebook Girls on a trip. I was absolutely shocked. I found out through one of the girls that she showed the entire group a shitty text that I sent N mocking a girls outfit (the one that was talking shit about me at a party). They were all reading my personal chats with N and talking about me all night. She turned all of them on me. Probably filled them with a ton of lies and made up an incident that I did at her birthday party. They have all blocked me. I have been shunned from an entire group of people. She got her revenge I guess? Oh and that family friend- that bridge was cut off too because of gossip and things said by N that backlashed on me. \n\nI was in a really bad place last year after all this. Like my identity was stripped and  I was imagining everything. How does someone have capacity to do this? How do those people not see that she is a lying, manipulating person? Where is my justice? No one cared to hear my side of the story. I feel like this horrible person who was exposed and twisted me to be someone I am not. I found other amazing people in my life but living in a small town I feel like if i meet anyone in my ethnicity that they are connected to her… or have heard rumours and gossip about me. \nIt's also hard seeing people around (I’ve ran into two out of the 7-10 girls) or being afraid of running into someone. Let alone the entire group at a restaurant. It really sucks to feel this hate for shit I didn’t do- this person they think I am is not me !!!!! \n\nThere is so much more but … this has been long. Any support, confirmation that N is truly an N, and anything that can bring me peace of mind would be appreciated.  Thanks for reading.",

She told me all these scary things about him that I actually felt like he was coming to murder me- I kept a bat by my bed. She told me “please tell me that if I don't break up with him you won't be my friend anymore.” I was on edge for WEEKS; she made me feel like my life was in danger. \n\nWeeks later, after being there for her at the drop of a hat supporting her breakup, there was an incident at her birthday party (which included a few random people from her work and none of the Facebook Group people because she didn't want anything to do with them). After the party, she gas lit me. She shamed me. She told me people thought I was super weird. Feedback I never received before. She was so cruel that I decided to block her. My gut said, this is the end. \n\nLastly, a few months later I am scrolling on Facebook and see a photo of her with the Facebook Girls on a trip. I was absolutely shocked. I found out through one of the girls that she showed the entire group a shitty text that I sent N mocking a girls outfit (the one that was talking shit about me at a party). They were all reading my personal chats with N and talking about me all night. She turned all of them on me. Probably filled them with a ton of lies and made up an incident that I did at her birthday party. They have all blocked me. I have been shunned from an entire group of people. She got her revenge I guess? Oh and that family friend- that bridge was cut off too because of gossip and things said by N that backlashed on me. \n\nI was in a really bad place last year after all this. Like my identity was stripped and  I was imagining everything. How does someone have capacity to do this? How do those people not see that she is a lying, manipulating person? Where is my justice? No one cared to hear my side of the story. I feel like this horrible person who was exposed and twisted me to be someone I am not. I found other amazing people in my life but living in a small town I feel like if i meet anyone in my ethnicity that they are connected to her… or have heard rumours and gossip about me. \nIt's also hard seeing people around (I’ve ran into two out of the 7-10 girls) or being afraid of running into someone. Let alone the entire group at a restaurant. It really sucks to feel this hate for shit I didn’t do- this person they think I am is not me !!!!! \n\nThere is so much more but … this has been long. Any support, confirmation that N is truly an N, and anything that can bring me peace of mind would be appreciated.  Thanks for reading.",

        "text": "I've been six months apart from my narcissistic and extremely controlling ex. Only two months of complete no contact though. When I left him because he made my life hell and his control and micromanagement of my life were increasing (everything had to be approved of by him: the clothes I could wear, the places I could go, what I could post on social media, the friends I could have, etc) and he was always accusing me of things I never did such as cheating on him or wanting his passport. There was no basis for his accusations, he just seemed to spiral and accuse me of things, while I was trying to continuously defend my integrity. I never cheated, not even flirted, but he didn't care. If I showed him my chat log and he couldn't find any proof, he'd say I erased the proofs, so there was no winning. With him, I cried every single day, put on weight, lost hair, and started having migraines. \n\nSince I left him after two years of trying to make him see how his control and manipulation were wrong, he turned the tables and said it was my fault because I wasn't patient enough, that he was prepared to change but I gave up. Only two days after I left he started dating a new girl and rubbing her in my face, saying how much better she was and how loving and respectful and less resentful she was compared to me. However, he still wanted to keep me in his life. He would say he wanted to get back with me but if I told him that I was open to it, but that I would not keep contact with him while he was dating someone new, he would get mad at me. He saw he couldn't make me stay because I was not prepared to be his second dish. Then he started saying we could try to work on the relationship once he went back to his country, but now, while in this country, we couldn't. I interpreted it as \"while I'm here, I'm going to date this new girl and see how it goes, and then I'll date you\" (we were long distance). I told him no. I told him I was not prepared to have him back after he started dating a new girl so soon and rubbed her in my face and shouted how much he loved her and how many feelings he had for her in only a month. Again, he got mad. I think he didn't expect it. \n\nThat wasn't over though. After a lot of back and forth in which he tried to soften my heart towards him (while still dating the new amazing girl), sending texts like \"what a coincidence, I'm writing to you now and hearing this thing that reminded me of you, blablabla\". When he realized I wasn't softening at all, that everything was over, he started saying we weren't compatible anyway, that he had to respect the new girl since she was committing a lot to him and wishing me a good life. He even said he wished me to have a peaceful relationship with another person and sent blessings, said may God bless you and prevent Satan from disrupting your peace (something like that, to which I responded that he had been the only one disrupting my peace, not Satan). \n\nAs a response, let him know that even if he was the last man on earth I wouldn't take him back anyway, that the damage he caused was permanent and told him that girl could have him, and if it wasn't that girl, the next one could have him. Coincidentally though, after his \"blessings\" I received very good news about my citizenship that was accepted, which would give me a lot of good opportunities in life. This was something I waited for two years or more and he knew it. So I also told him that this good thing happened to me, that maybe his blessings worked, knowing full well that he knew how much I waited for that. Well, he couldn't send any congratulations message or anything. He completely vanished. Before, he would go back and forth with manipulative messages, but now he was gone. I also didn't attempt to send another message and partially felt relieved that this toxic texting back and forth was over. \n\nHowever, it made me see how fake his blessings were. When his blessings had no real outcome in my life, he had no problem throwing them at me. The moment something really good happened to me, he literally vanished. Is this common in narcissists? He couldn't even make the minimal effort of saying \"hey, congratulations, you deserve it\" after he sent his fake blessings.\n\nThe only thing I know from him now is that he drinks a lot every single night and plays video games for hours every single night.",

My son does not have a relationship with either of them and he will be confused and possibly hurt. I am extremely vigilant in protecting him and keeping him away from her toxicity was in fact the driving force to going NC. My aunt and I used to be extremely close but the family has now been manipulated and poisoned against me. The message was sent by my aunt but per usual, the words have been dictated to her by NMom. I reckon that Nmom would love me to say “no” to this request as it would add to her victimhood and make me out to be the heartless daughter that she has been preaching. I can hear her narrative now and my many cousins wondering “what happened” to me. I am by no means going to give in to these games as my son will always come first, but what do I do? Block? Respond?

My dad was manipulated and controlled by my nmom. My nmom would never call or be interested in her own grandkids in nz. We moved from nz. I have blocked them of all platforms. How do you recover? Is therapy necessary? What helps to process all of this? Its so much to unpack. I don't want my kids to ever go what i went through and now im putting myself first in my life. Of coarse my nmom and nsis is gone make my name so bad and smeared. It's really hard and my nsis friends have already started blocking me without even askin my side of things. I've been the victim for far too long and enough is enough. Im looking for counselling talking to my spouse helps alot he gives me tips to work through it. Is it normal that the pain is so deep and sore. All my nmom friends and my nsis friends believe them without questioning. My mom stole money while my gran was living with her. My uncle got abused too for asking straightforward questions. My mom also abused my gran. My gran was an empath and was my only emotional support. Ive also realised my mom never wanted me. My dad is just as quilty for not doing anything to protect me when i was growing up. According to everyone around us we looked like the perfect family but behind closed doors we were disfunctional, toxic and nasty family with no structure ni talking. I was gaslighted, degraded constantly criticised, as long as i smile and wave my mom wouldnt touch me or tell me something. She is very manipulative and ive realised she is the one in the family that have lied, and devided the family. She abused and was so nasty with my gran too after stealing all her money $50k. She can never be happy for me ever or my nsis. If I was doing good she was radio silence and nothing. She only talks to me and my nsis jumps on the band wagon and say whatever to support my nmom. My nsis have 3 kids they are 5, 3 and one is 3 months old. It break my heart to see the kids being raised in that environment. My nsis kids they didnt ask for it. My nsis husband is not any better or know any better or just very gullable as he doesn't care and just go out partying all weekend long with my nsis and go drop the kids of at my nmom house. I was never allowed to be me to express myself to be heard and validated. I was immediately shut down and my nmom would rather do what she wants and her family already breaking and doing it still. She is so selfish, greedy and self centered i never want to be like that ever like she ever was and not want to repeat the cycle. No matter what i do i was never good enough. I have self worth issues and big self doubts. I never believed in myself and never have self confidence. I have from abandon issues to trust issues and everything because of all this trauma. If it didnt serve my nsis or nmom it wasnt good enough and i wasnt allowed to do that. It was always about them they can't see passed their own eyes that their is other people. All I know is the one person that was suppose to protect me, destroyed me. Never protected me and my needs was never even on the list. There is a special place in hell for these narc people. I dont know how you live with yourself and sleep at night knowing you destroy humans for a living. The house i grew up in was a prison and everyone was isolated from me. I lived in survival mode mostly and tried to get away but failed. My mom broke up me and my boyfriend frm a long time ago. My nmom sat in an interview my first one so not normal. My nmom always look for ways to spy on my and make myself look like the nasty one always cuzzing me out and belittling me. When would stand up for myself my nmom and nsis would just gaslight me. I was like a robot living in someone elses body if it wasnt for my husband I would have been unalive myself. My nmom never cared and never give a crap and that is whats hitting me the hardest. Sorry for the long post have to just get it all out there. I am an empath my grandmother was an empath and she was my rock. She raised me being my only emotional support.",

We share  alot of mutual interests and hobbies.\n\nH randomly approached me F(30)at a family gathering and mentioned she was concerned about my M(31) partner- H said he was 'too quiet' and that she didn't like this- we had been dating for 5 years at this point and up until then no one had anything but nice things to say about him and he got along well with everyone participating happily in all family events. I told H the truth: he's just introverted and not always very chatty even with his own family, but i love that about him it compliments and calms my anxious personality, he's a great listener and very introspective. I didn't really think much of it at the time, but over the course of 6 months at any family gathering H kept prying asking if I was ok saying I looked sad, wanting to know if we fought, etc.  But he and I are fine  i think we actually have a really strong, honest relationship we talk about everything and share our goals and expectations. My problem was - I was just really anxious about attending events with H because she was making this whole big deal about pulling me aside infront of our other family for 'private girl  talks' no one really paid much attention but I did notice a shift with some other family over a few months - they began commenting to me he was really quiet and all the other concerns H had asked me about at one time or another. I ignored H's gossip and baiting I had faith my family knows she can be dramatic and exaggerates. Several other cousins had a pretty close relationship with him we played boardgames weekly together for the past 5 years so I figured rather than feed her argument I would let it fizzle out- H's used my anxiety diagnosis before to try to get me to slip up in conversations ex \"are you sure you want to buy a house with bf or is it your anxiety making you feel like your missing out\" regardless that I tell her its not how it works because of my anxiety I've always been cautious with my decision making and im very good at managing my anxiety and knowing when I might need extra support. Prior to this issue with my bf starting I thought it was out of concern for me but now im doubtful.\n\nDuring this time H got engaged, bought a condo and in her words was living her best life (rich fiance and inlaws, new condo new job, planning her dream wedding ect) My bf and I bought a cute little cottage as well in that time and we're renovating it together - H was pretty plain when we made the announcement to our family she thought our house was a fixer upper- cute but not as good as her condo. Shed also made comments that we had been together so long and he still hadnt proposed while she got a ring after one year. I was happy for her and all our other cousins our age doing similar things with their partners we'd all been really close growing up and I was excited we were all moving into this new part of our lives at the same pace.\n\nA few weeks after H's engagement she called me to have a girl's afternoon get together - I thought she might ask me to be a bridesmaid or wanted some help with wedding stuff (im pretty creative)when I got there she was pretty short with me telling me she had another thing to do in about 90 minutes proceeded to tell me all about her fabulous wedding plans and how prefect her fiance is - i gave her an engagement gift which she thanked me for but said she didnt want, then let me know I was not in the running as a bridesmaid I didn't fit the image of what she was wanting to go for and she couldn't not have the other girls she'd asked(cousins on her other side)  my feelings were hurt I felt like we were closer than this and it was a bit callous to throw this girls afternoon 'party' to rudley tell me she didn't want me in her wedding party - I had no expectations I was going to be in it I'd hoped but I was realistic with myself.I was a bit shocked with her and just told her polielty it was her wedding, so she should plan it how she wanted. I only wanted her to be happy on her day. Her fiance came home then and she hustled me out barely let me say congrats to him and wouldn't let us speak.\n\nFor the next few months it was a bit awkward but as normalish as it had been I was a bit more careful with what I said to H or other family members and though this crap was finally over.\n\nSadly her dad passed away our whole family was there supporting H, her other cousins and aunts were a bit weird with me as was H. A few comments were made about my bf not attending( work would not let him off) but I wrote it off as mourning and just confusion I'd lost my mom a few years back and knew what it was like and did my best to help and support.\nTwo days after the funeral I had a day off work and went over to assist H's mom at her house -  H her fiancée and her sister in law were there and said my aunt would be back soon so I was cleaning up the kitchen a bit when H called me into the living room where they all were and H asked me to sit down because she wanted to ask me something - I figured mabey about grief counseling since I'd lost my mum but she let me know she'd though about this long and hard and with my bf not coming to support her when her dad passed she was no longer going to invite him to her wedding but I'd put in alot of effort so I was still welcome. I kinda blanked in that moment white noise wtf where did this come from and just sat there - H started up again with her list of why she hated my bf her main point was she felt he was \"emotionally mistreating me\". H's fiancée and sister in law kinda just sat there saying nothing and I could hear my aunt and her brother getting back from funeral related errands, so I just told H my bf tried really hard to get the time off but he couldn't and he was sorry for that and it's her wedding she can invite whomever she likes - I was very polite because while I was really upset holding in tears I didn't want my aunt to walk into a fight about something I though was so stupid and inappropriate to be discussing in that moment. After I left later that night I had a good cry in my car and just decided I'd let it go for now it could be her grief talking like I mentioned she can exaggerate and be a bit dramatic at times I'd wait until she sent the invitations out. I spoke with my dad and bf (separately) they'd begun to notice my anxiety getting worse and I was behaving differently. We had good chats and left it at that. \n\nUntil the next big family event it was awkward for a few months and myself my dad and my brother had each been approached separately by my 2 aunts and 2 other cousins about my partner they expressed concerns about my bfs quietness and theyd been told by 'someone' close to me my bf was abusing me and he forced me to buy our house so he could isolate me away from family. My brother and dad supported my bf and i and I firmly but politely told anyone who asked that I had no idea where they'd heard these rumors I was deeply hurt by them and that they thought so poorly of Dan after all these years. And that indeed if he was hurting me I would have gone to my dad and brother for help, hell even my bfs parents and sister wouldn't stand for that kind of hbehaviour from him and gladly have helped me if i needed it. I figured now with the parents involved and thoroughly smacked down by my dad bro and i H would get over whatever this was.  \n\nThis past Thanksgiving we were at H's mums home, by this point I was so anxious about going to my families events and stressed out about the whole scenario  I hadn't been sleeping and after 2 years of no panic attacks I was starting to have mild ones again my bf and I decided while I didn't want to allow H to chase us out of family gatherings ( my family has always been super important and holidays are something I look forward to alot) it would be best to take it slow with this one and stay only a short period and then go to his family's gathering for longer than we normally do. We'd only been there mabey 15 -20 minutes and were having a good time chatting with other cousins when H got everyone's attention and told us she was going to be handing out invitations - I'd worried about this happening and told both her and my aunt ahead of time we would be leaving early ( i hoped this would be a preventative measure H could hand us ours on our way out and then have her fanfare with everyone else saving my partner the embarrassment of being excluded infront of everyone and H from awkward questions/possible fights her inlaws had also flown in from out of town and I didn't want them to have a bad impression of anyone ) Needless to say H didn't do this and handed them out announcing names as she did so - I don't think my other cousins noticed but my brother and his wife did and I had already been having a hard time holding it together so waited 5 minutes holding back tears not talking or opening my invite. I put the envelope with my name only away and told my bf I wanted to leave now- he bundled me up my brother and his wife told us they would cover for us and we left. About 2 hours later H text me and said i left abruptly and she hoped she didn't upset me and that I was excited to party at her wedding with her. I ignored it for a few days needing time to calm down and about 6 days later I sent H a really heartfelt message I put all my feelings about the last few months into it and how inappropriate her behavior was I'd given her the benefit of the doubt over and over and that at the end of the day she'd done alot of damage to our relationship and i was dissapointes in her and I didn't want to speak to her for a while i needed some space for myself. Her reply was what you'd expect she denys her actions even silly inconsequential things says she was looking out for me I can't tell her how to plan her wedding and she didn't owe my bf any kindness and she didn't want to talk to me. \nAt this point our relationship is irrevocably damaged and I am not sure if I can forgive H's behaviour toward my bf. My problem now is how to approach the bulk of my cousins and aunts - most are quite some supporting her and others I am unsure of. I'm upset as I had  kept this between her and I for quite a while hoping she's reach out to talk to my bf or all of us together so we could resolve this like adults, while she involved our mutual family and her father side months before I knew she'd spoken with anyone besides me im willing to be courteous and polite to her at family gatherings so I can still have that bond with everyone else I viewed her mom as a second mom after mine passed her brother is like my own and I love them all very much and I'm a bit lost. My Bf  has been super supportive and while he told me he has never liked H he never said anything because he knew I was close with her, he is happy to support me in whatever decision I make. \n\nAt this time I have RSVPd no to her wedding and have not heard from her since Thanksgiving my bro and his wife are supporting my bf and I. H's mom my aunt barely acknowledges me and hardly speaks to me my cousins are distant but polite my father is enraged and has attempted to speak to H's mom his sister but she is avoiding all contact with him.",

It's been rough, and eye opening, and terrible, but my headspace is not completely full of her. Feels really good.\n\nShe and her boyfriend are going on a cruise. I know this because my kids told me. The cruise leaves today (Monday). I got a text on Saturday that said \"I need to talk! It's urgent!\". I immediately put my phone down and took a breath. I asked our daughter (19) to text her mom and see what was going on. Our daughter knows the situation and understands why I'm not talking to her.\n\nTurns out, they didn't get their passports, so they needed to use their birth certificates. I assume the passports just didn't come in in time, but I also don't care about why. She needed our marriage certificate to prove that the last name on her birth certificate is her, because she didn't change her name after the divorce.\n\nWhich I think is super interesting. Needing proof that we were married. Funny.\n\nSo, of course I still have the certificate because I am responsible and organized.\n\nSide note: I took all the kids on a cruise last year and didn't have any problems securing passports for all of them in time.\n\n2nd point of interest: She hates cruising. She went on one about 7 years ago with the fam, and never wanted to go again. She said she felt \"stuck\". Unable to \"escape\". Interesting.\n\nHer boyfriend somehow convinced her. My understanding of NPD and BPD is that she will take on the preferences and opinions of her new person...at least in the beginning. She's also now into football, fishing, and Lord of the Rings, among other things she hates.\n\nSo, here's where my psychological analysis comes in (which I'm not sure if it's true or not, but it could be). Is she wanting to make sure that I know she is doing something with someone who isn't me that she previously would never do with me? And to call it \"urgent\" Looks to me like she wants me to know that she still needs my help.\n\nI know this is possibly \"reaching\", but I am allowing myself the entertainment of thinking it's a pathetic attempt at keeping me at arms length.\n\nWhen they were saying goodbye to hang up, I heard her say, \"Tell Papi I didn't mean to bother him.\"\n\nInteresting.\n\nIt's not actually bothering me. But what she did do is attempt to water a seed she's planted in the kids that I am someone who gets bothered. The kids live with me. They know I don't get bothered. They know I'm chill. They know why I'm choosing to not communicate with her.\n\nAnd on that note, I am feeling more and more free. This whole interaction was like someone I used to know asking for a favor. Someone I didn't really even used to have a connection to. My stomach didn't sink, my thoughts didn't reel, it didn't ruin my day. I felt good about not jumping to her rescue, I held firm on no contact, and I was not manipulated into bending over backwards for her.\n\nTwo years since discard this week. She probably has no idea (or care) of the date.",

        "text": "nMomster died. It's finally over. \n\nI feel relief and sadness, it's an odd mixture of emotions tbh but I knew that mourning her a second time would be complicated. I no longer have to stress about her trying to weasel her way back into my life or trying to meet my son. I no longer have to worry about seeing her at family events or trying to keep my address from falling into her hands. \n\nThere are *many* memories resurfacing, whether because I'm talking and thinking about her a lot right now or because I feel safe to remember them I don't know...but the more memories I go through the more I remember why I went NC in the first place.\n\nNow, when people ask about her, I can finally say she's dead instead of explaining why I don't have a relationship with her and getting the pity or the dressing down for being selfish.\n\nIt's over.",

I just purchased a house and I’m getting ready to move so I am packing and throwing things away and it’s not something I wanted to carry with me. He didn’t pick up so I messaged him. I guess I was more surprised that I called him after unblocking him and was able to get through to his phone. I figured that he had me blocked as well. I’m glad I didn’t get a response. Surprisingly, I didn’t feel sad, mad or even disappointed. Indifference, is what I feel at this point. I guess that’s a good thing!",

        "text": "I recently realized that I've turned a corner in my healing journey after I was insulted by a narc and took it as a huge compliment. \n\nI've known this for years but only recently internalized it: When narcs criticize, they rarely make things up out of whole cloth. They either display a surprising amount of self awareness by projecting their own shortcomings onto you, or they take what they see as your best qualities and pointedly reverse them. For example...\n\nMy friend's narc husband just told her that he doesn't like me because I am a \"boring, basic bitch\". My reaction was to say, \"boring? Basic??\" and then burst out laughing. I am a lot a things, maybe even a bitch now and then, but \"boring\" and \"basic\" have never been on the list. I am a bona fide weirdo and if I had any more character I'd be a cartoon. I told my bf about it and he had the same reaction. \n\nIn the past, this would have really hurt my feelings and made me so self conscious. Now I know that he only chose those words because they are the opposite of who I am, which makes it a wonderful compliment when put through the Narc Translator.",

They left a note in my mailbox and one on my car. They said something along the lines of: “stopped by today to say hello, but couldn’t reach you. Let me know if you need anything and sorry we missed each other!” \n\nI was so paranoid but I went out and did my errands anyway. I’m still scared they’re going to try to come by again. It’s one thing to say you’ll be strong if they ambush you, and another thing to actually be strong about it. It would really really suck. \n\nI want them to leave me alone but it feels like they never will.",
