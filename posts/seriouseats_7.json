Would increasing the recipe by 1.5x present any issues in a dish like this? My only concerns are 1) not enough room in the pan and 2) too much bread crumbs if 1.5x. But if feels like 1.5x would bring the dish close to the brim of the pan, just enough to not go over.",

As a result, I used all of the cream the recipe called for to get it halfway up the slices. \n\nOther than that, I think I hit the recipe exactly right (including using a mandolin to get 1/8” slices).

The meatballs and sauce from The Food Lab were unquestionably the best thing I ever made. \n\nHowever, I attempted making two of the Serious Eats \"No Hold Barred\" lasagnas and the final product is a touch bland. I'm likely to blame for under-salting, and also ran out of room making the bolognese. Massively underestimated the volume of sauce, even using my largest stock pot. Also was short on parm cheese.\n\nLong story short, I cooked one lasagna fresh Christmas. One I froze, uncooked, and planned to give away. While it's good, it's under seasoned and needs salt. What's the best way to \"fix\" this for baking the frozen one?

        "text": "Omg - I can’t believe I made this! The prime rib was absolutely perfect and will be my go-to recipe for all future prime rib preparations. I don’t have an instant read thermometer so I used multi-probe leave-in thermometer and kept track of the temp in two places — pulled it out of the oven for the initial rest at roughly 132 degrees and then went back in for a few mins at 500 which yielded a tender inside and a nice crisp bark on the outside.\n\nOther items were herb roasted carrots, a classic mashed potato, creamy horseradish sauce, and a warm brussel sprout salad w/ bacon, apple, pecans, pomegranate, and lots of hard cheese shavings.\n\nThe bit that stumped me was the gravy. I sautéed a pound of mushrooms, garlic, and butter the day before and was planning to make a gravy using drippings from the prime rib, some flour, and store bought beef broth. I ended up having to change plans at the last minute and forgo the drippings because there were none! I probably should have expected that given the low cooking temp. I ended up making a roux with butter and flour then adding the broth and mushrooms as well as some soy sauce for color and salt, but I really didn’t feel the flavors were developed that well nor the color deep/rich enough. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips/recipes to help produce a flavorful, rich brown gravy when using Kenji’s prime rib method?",

        "text": "Sigh, hi friends.  I’m afraid I’ve made a grave mistake!\n\nI quadrupled the recipe for Kenji’s [Better No-Knead Bread](https://www.seriouseats.com/better-no-knead-bread-recipe). \n\nThe dough is supposed to rise at room temp for 12-24 hours.  Mine has been sitting in a 23C room for 12-24 hours. It has been 3 hours, and the photo shows the rise so far.  It has doubled after a quarter of the time (bottom edge of tape is starting height, AT the 2 qt. line, now at the 4 qt. line).\n\nWill transferring the dough to a larger container at this point cause it to deflate irreparably?  Am I better off leaving it as is, and putting the current container into a bigger container and covering this nesting doll setup?  Or am I ok to dump the dough out into a bigger container now?\n\nThank you for any help you can offer this too-enthusiastic person!",

I think it turned out pretty well. \n\nHere’s the recipe. \n\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/slow-and-easy-pannetone-recipe\n\nI was intrigued by a large display of Panettone in boxes while shopping for Thanksgiving, so I started thinking about making it then. I figured I could probably make something better myself. \n\nI made at least one mistake - it mixed most of the ingredients and forgot to mix in the biga! It was hard to get it to blend/kneed in after that, but after a lot of mixing and kneeling I think I got the consistency right. It was a very wet dough - it never really balled up, so I added more flour. \n\nI really like the flavor and texture. I am thinking about buying some paper molds so I can make it again with the traditional shape. I would also try a more traditional recipe using sourdough starter instead of instant yeast.",

Due to the blizzard, my family has decided to move our big family meal to Monday, 2 days later than initially scheduled. My question is: Since my green beans and button mushrooms will 4 days removed from the grocery store, should I make the green bean/mushroom/cream mixture today? Then add the fried shallots and cook it on the day of the dinner? Or just keep the veggies in the fridge and they will be fine 4 days out of the grocery store. Thanks for any two-cents I get! Happy Holidays to you all!",
