Sky bird rock drop smaller black rock from sky.  \n\n\nWhen black rock almost hit ground, black rock create much light! Light was bright as big glowing sky rock that make day!  \n\n\nOne bonk later, Jugg get push back and hear big sound! Light from black rock create big wind! Much wind!! Jugg lost balance, but Jugg okay. Jugg ears made ring noise.  \n\n\nFive bonk later, Jugg feel much heat! Jugg felt like Jugg was in front of fire! Almost hurt! Jugg see that area closer to light from black rock become fire! Jugg feel terror.  \n\n\nTwenty bonk later, big wind now go opposite direction towards where black rock light was. Big wind made huge dust, which made mushroom shape in sky. Jugg feel more terror.  \n\n\nFour sky rock spin later, Jugg tribe no feel good. Land animal no feel good either. Jugg tribe move to land farther from where black rock light was. Land animal feet better there.  \n\n\nShould Jugg worry about more evolved sky bird rock dropping black rock that bring light, fire, wind, no feel good near or on tribe? Any tribe witness black death rock before?",
