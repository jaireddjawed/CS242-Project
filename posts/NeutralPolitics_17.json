        "text": "In honor of Presidents Day in the United States, I thought I'd ask about Presidents.\n\nA [Presidential system of government](http://www.annenbergclassroom.org/term/presidential-system) has three distinct branches of government, legislative, executive, and judicial, and heads the executive branch with an independently elected President who is directly accountable to the people.  \n\nIn contrast, a [Parliamentary system of government](http://www.annenbergclassroom.org/term/parliamentary-system) has as the effective leader of the executive a prime minister, who is elected by and accountable to the legislature.  The prime minister generally either must be from a party holding a majority of the legislative seats, or else be supported in their continuance in office by enough members from other parties to maintain office.\n\nScholars such as [Juan Linz](https://scholar.harvard.edu/levitsky/files/1.1linz.pdf) argue that Parliamentary systems are \"more conducive to stable\ndemocracy than\" Presidential systems.\n\nHowever other scholars such as [Jose Cheibub](https://sites.hks.harvard.edu/fs/pnorris/Acrobat/stm103%20articles/Cheibub_Pres_Parlt.pdf) argue that term stability and having an office with a national constituency are very important features and that Presidential systems can be designed to overcome some of the flaws critics would propose.\n\n",

        "text": "There was [a recent article in the Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2020-census-prison-population_us_5a7cb966e4b044b3821b0507) that made me start thinking about this issue. \n\nThe author of the article focuses primarily on the issue of redistricting based on this information. I was curious about other impacts, such as potential resources being diverted from lower income areas because of the way prisoners are being counted. Are there ways that this can affect areas beyond just the redistricting angle? \n\nThe article is referring to the announcement on 14 February that the Census Bureau will continue the trend of counting prisoners at their location of incarceration, what they deem to be their 'usual residence'. [Their webpage](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/about/residence-rule.html) explains the reasoning behind this.\n\n&gt; The Census Act of 1790 established the concept of “usual residence” as the main principle in determining where people should be counted, and this concept has been followed in all subsequent censuses. “Usual residence” has been defined as the place where a person lives and sleeps most of the time. This place is not necessarily the same as the person's voting residence or legal residence.\n\nThe article cites a [memo (pdf alert) from the Prison Policy Initiative](https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/letters/2016/PPI_Demos_2016_FRN_comment.pdf) that lays out an argument for not counting prisoners where they are incarcerated. \n\nThe numbers are not yet out for 2017, but with [a prison population at the end of 2016](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=6187) of around 1.5 million people, it is worthy of discussion; looking at the arguments for and against counting prisoners where they are imprisoned and the potential impacts either direction can have on communities\n\n\n",

[Roughly 32-42% of Americans report that they live in a household with guns,](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/15/politics/guns-dont-know-how-many-america/index.html) though the only data we have come from surveys, and therefore there is a margin of error.\n\nBoth of the principal surveys showed that rates of gun ownership declined from the 1970s-1990s and have been about steady since.\n\nSurveys also estimate that among gun owners, the number of firearms owned is highly skewed, with a very small portion of the population (about 3%) [owning half of all firearms in the US.](https://qz.com/1095899/gun-ownership-in-america-in-three-charts/)\n\nThe US also has a very high rate of homicide compared to peer countries, and an about average suicide rate compared to peer countries.  [Firearm homicides in the US are much more common than all homicides in any peer country](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-u-s-gun-deaths-compare-to-other-countries/) however even US non-firearm homicides would put the US above any western country except the Czech Republic.  The total homicide rate of 5.3 per 100,000 is more than twice as high as the next highest (Czech) homicide rate of 2.6 per 100,000.\n\nThe US has a much higher firearm suicide rate than peer countries (6.3 per 100,000) but a fairly low non-firearm suicide rate, which puts the US about middle of the pack on suicides. (same source as above paragraph)\n\nGiven these differences, is there any good evidence on different measures relating to guns which have been effective in reducing violent crime, especially homicide, and suicide?  Are there any notable failures or cases where such policies backfired?",
