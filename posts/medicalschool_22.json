I’ve noticed that people during finals generally are so stressed and start correcting each other on things and get very tense. Everyone loves to brag about how much work they’re getting done. My friends however will do that all the time. They talk so much about things I don’t even relate to and I don’t have energy sometimes to talk about what I like because they don’t even relate or they’ll try to make it relate with something they know but it’s just not the same. You know if you say something, friends will just agree with you even if it’s not completely true? Mine don’t do that with me. However one of the people in our group is very smart and they hype that person up. She could say shit and they’ll be like “I love that for you” or “ya I agree”.  \n\nWhen I say something, they will be like “well maybe it’s this. Or that” and in my mind I’m just like “JUST freaking agree with me! I don’t wanna start a whole philosophical debate for goodness sake”.    I think they and a lot of people at my med school assume that cuz you’re not loud and outspoken like others, then you’re probs not smart. However I know for a fact I score as much or better than this person sometimes but I just don’t brag. \n\n\nI don’t wanna since I have common sense. Also I’m the only person of color in my group and I’m at a school in the south and I just generally feel like I’m not what’s considered attractive here nor do I fit in completely. I feel very alone and I think it kind of amplifies my Insecurities. I think my bf is sometimes even taken aback why I feel so insecure but I don’t feel confident in any aspect of my life right now. Maybe this is just imposter syndrome idk. Do y’all have friends like this in med school? Do I just need to get thick skin?",

        "text": "Listen, reader..I don't know why you're on medicalschool reddit as a student. I came here to see the panic or paranoira or fear of med students and...wow, it is insane. \n\nIt is also very unneccessary.\n\nYou are part of a very elite group, just by thinking this reddit will help you through school, because..you're in god damn USA medical school! So 43% of applicants get into medical school. If that was an NFL passing completion %, you wouldn't even sniff the league. It is also the NBA record for % of 3-pointers made, thank you steph curry.\n\nLets consider this. Most people applying to any medical school in America, DO NOT GET IN. And not only that, this 43% is not 43% of the general population. So think about this: you had better odds than a coin flip and you were about like top 99th% in terms of education and/or intelligence and/or personality. (probably a bit of all 3)\n\nSO, what are you worried about? I get it with some specilities, especially the surgical subs. Perhaps you need a research year. Still, is that SO stressful? \n\nThe other stressful aspect I see from people is \"where will I match? location is so important\". Is it? This is not the rest of your life, its not even close. Average graduation age is 28, and we will probably all be touching 90. So 4-6 years plus 2-3 resident is about 1/8 of your adult life. People are very concerned where they match, mostly cause of geography, but it is not like youd quit cause you had to go somewhere else.\n\nKeep \"where\" you're going expections low, cause why does that matter? Keep \"honors in every rotation\" low on your priorities, cause..honestly..residency programs dgaf. They care about the person, the empathy, personability, the \"want' to help patients and their families. \n\nTHAT is what matters. THAT is what's key. Shelf scores mean nothing when you're patient is dying. Shelf scores mean 0% when you save their lives. Go where you're comfortable with, have a frickin awesome time and help some people. \n\nIsn't that why we became doctors in the first place?\n\nSincerely,\n\nA nonstressed MS3 applying to General Surgery.",

        "text": "Hello All, I am a ER RN and am going to be pursing Medical School. I apologize for the long post but will appreciate any guidance i can get. I have some questions. First a bit about myself, I'm a Registered Nurse (24 y/o M) who currently works in the ER and have always had an interest in science, medicine, and helping others. I had thought of med school when I graduated high school but decided to go into nursing instead with the end goal being Nurse Practitioner. I finish my Bachelors in Nursing next semester. I have weighed out the decision between NP and MD/DO and decided to go to med school because I feel I will always have the lingering feeling of \"what if\" if I don't atleast try, and I also appreciate the wealth of knowledge and expertise the Physicians I work with have and know I won't get that from an NP program.\n\nI still need all of my science pre reqs so my game plan is:\n\nSummer (full term)\n-BSN Capstone (Final BSN class)\n\nSummer A\nChem 1 and Lab\nPhysics 1 and Lab\n\nSummer B\nChem 2 and Lab\nPhysics 2 and Lab\n\nFall\nBio 1 and Lab\nOrgo Chem 1 and Lab\nBiochem\nCram for MCAT\n\nJanuary- Take MCAT and apply to med schools\n\nSpring\nBio 2 and Lab\nOrgo Chem 2 and Lab\n\n\n\n\nMy questions for you:\n\nAfter giving up on med school I had the B's get Degrees mentality and didn't put forth maximum effort into my courses. I currently have a cum 3.02 GPA and hope to bring it closer to a 3.2-3.3 after all of the above classes are finished. I am taking two current BSN classes not listed above. I'm unsure how to figure my \"science gpa\" but imagine it will be higher than the cum 3.2 after all the above are complete.\n\n-With a competitive MCAT score and a cum 3.2 gpa do I have any reasonable chances at getting into med school? This a main concern for me.\n\n- Will all of the above classes be sufficient for pre-reqs? (I have already taken Comp 1&amp;2, Algebra, Statistics, Psych, Microbio, Anat and Phys 1&amp;2, etc.)\n\n-Are volunteer hours and research a deal breaker? I have hundreds of volunteer hours from 2012-2016 in highschool but none since, I was in leadership roles in the clubs that did the community service as well. I plan to volunteer as a nurse for a local free clinic that is open one day per week. I have no clinical research experience. I will be working full time as a nurse up until I am accepted into med school. I work 3- 12 hour shifts per week.\n\n- Referencing the above schedule will I be okay to take my MCAT without taking Bio 2 and Orgo Chem 2? I'll be 25 this summer, 26 by the time med school would start and don't want to have to wait an extra year to apply. I've seen most schools will only accept MCAT scores as recent as the Jan before the application period. What do you recommend for MCAT studying? I don't mind paying for a study program.\n\n- Is there anything I'm missing or should also be doing? I have Physicians I work with who can provide my letters of reference.\n\nThank you for your time.",

        "text": "I think SDN and outside sources really shit on this school way more than needed. I want to do a name and fame for this school. Its not perfect. Its not a top 20. I'm not even arguing its a top 75. But I think its a great place to get an education. Its tried and true, and its the least gunner environment  i've encountered in higher education to date. Don't get me wrong, the rotation situation stinks, its fragmented and all over the place. That's not what i'm advocating for or against. Pre-clinically, this school does a great job setting you up for success. They make it easy for you to succeed, they don't have huge expectations for you to show up to every lecture, every class, and are flexible. Need an excused absence from a team based learning activity, just submit it in the school app. And as of this year, they don't even require a reason anymore. Only time you need a reason/doctor's not is to move an exam date or request an extended absence. The match list at DUCOM is great. Its not full of top 10s or ivy's, but we send tens of student to places like Cooper, Jefferson, and Temple. We send a small handfull of students to Mt. Siani, Stanford, and Kiaser. Yes, a majority of students don't enter the program envisioning themselves going into neuro surg or gunning for top residency in NYC or MGH for derm, but the ones that do have a network of 10,000 previous DUCOM physicians across to the country to make connections. Its a no frills school, that doesn't get in the way of its students (most times). Yes, there's a high turnover of faculty, yes there's limited resources and its expensive, but so are most private med schools in this country. My friends and I haven't at any point felt stressed or overdone by this school, they'll sometimes listen and accommodate where possible, and they've even built a new med school for the incoming class to attend in the heart of the city. Its not perfect, and if you got into Jeff or Penn i wouldn't' tell you, \"go to Drexel over those schools\", but at the same time i've enjoyed my time here. I think we've had it easier than most of those programs, and the flipped class room style makes it conducive to travel during your MS1 and MS2 years while not falling behind. Anyways, here's for being okay DUCOM. Not saying a lot, but i guess it does in a room of toxic programs.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/11azqrs/a_guide_to_medical_school_things_i_wish_i_knew/",
        "text": "Hey all, this is part 3 of a guide to medical school. This part focuses on Research and Publications. \n\nHere's Part 1, where I wrote about the general mindset you need to have:([https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/10s77ts/a\\_guide\\_to\\_medical\\_school\\_things\\_i\\_wish\\_i\\_knit's ](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/10s77ts/a_guide_to_medical_school_things_i_wish_i_knew/)\n\nHere's Part 2, where I wrote about boards studying:([https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/10xb3u6/a\\_guide\\_to\\_medical\\_school\\_boards\\_part\\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/10xb3u6/a_guide_to_medical_school_boards_part_2/))\n\nI’m writing this as a fourth-year currently applying for residency in a competitive surgical subspecialty. I got 250+ on both boards,  20+ research pubs in a year without prior experience, finished away rotations, and completed interviews. \n\nHopefully I match but even if i don't I will not regret writing this if at least one reader benefits. \n\nI wrote this because there are many things I regret doing in medical school. \n\nI sorely wish I had someone who warned me ahead of time. I could have saved a lot of time, energy, emotional wellbeing.\n\nThis guide is basically composed of the things I wish I knew, and is written for first, second, third year, and early fourth years.\n\nAs my time in medical school comes to a close, I'm hoping to help at least one of you, since posts from random strangers on this subreddit helped me a ton throughout my med school journey.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n=================\n\n# Part 3: How to Leverage Research into Interviews\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo rehash what I said in part 1 of my guide, you should always ALWAYS take with a grain of salt any advice someone gives you (including me). \n\nAlways evaluate what someone's actually done when taking their advice. \n\nDo NOT take boards advice from someone who is a PHD in biochemistry (they've never done it themselves).   \nDo NOT take clinical rotations advice from a 2nd year med student.   \nDo NOT take research advice from someone who has not felt the pain of publishing research and going through ERAS/interviews to see the impact of that research on matching. \n\nThat said, I'm going to tell you about my credentials when writing this. \n\nI have published over 20 peer-reviewed publications all with Pubmed IDs including case reports, systematic reviews, meta-analysis, retrospective chart review, and prospective studies. \n\nI have presented research at multiple national and international conferences. \n\nI have seen how both community and academic residents and attendings react to this resume, as well as the resulting interview invites and interviews. \n\nAlso, I need to let whoever is reading this know that while I am proud of my work, there was a significant sacrifice to mental health, overall well-being, and time with loved ones involved. \n\nI could have leveraged my time and energy much more effectively and lived a fuller life had I known some key lessons beforehand. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLesson 1: Reputation/Relationships &gt;&gt;&gt; Number of Pubs\n\nIf nothing else, take this lesson from this post. \n\nThe real currency of research as it pertains to matching into a residency program is a way to gain **reputation and relationships with people with decision-making power**. \n\nWhen I was an MS1/2, all of my peers would talk about publication numbers as if it were some kind of secret sauce to get into competitive specialties. \n\n\"Oh wow so and so has 15 pubs they are definitely gonna match derm!\" \n\nIt was not until MS3/4 when I actually started to look at matches, that I realized that there were plenty of people with numerous publications who did not match. \n\nAnd there were plenty of people with little to no publications that did match. \n\nIn an extreme example, I know of someone who had 50+ publications and failed to match (went to a USMD school, I do not know their board scores unfortunately).\n\nWhat happened? \n\nI realized that there is a whole other game beyond the game of ERAS/research CVs. \n\nIn some programs, a very very high emphasis is placed on phone calls made by attendings from other prestigious research heavy academic programs. \n\nThese attendings often went to prestigious research heavy programs together and know each other personally. \n\nThose phone calls are very often the basis for someone getting an interview invitation or even getting put on a rank to match list. \n\nWhat do they talk about on those phone calls? \n\nResearch often serves as the fodder for those phone calls and the \"mentors\" could talk about a candidates qualities with respect to the research that they did. \n\nIn contrast, in some other programs, they do not place much weight on those phone calls at all. \n\nInstead, a high emphasis was placed on clinical performance on an away rotations, remarks on LORs about clinical abilities, and personality/tolerability. I will write more about this in my next post.\n\nSo, depending on the program, phone calls or clinical performance on an away can be much much more important than publication number. \n\nYou might be thinking, \"wow, medicine is so full of nepotism and corruption. why doesn't number of research pubs or board scores guarantee you a spot?\" \n\nThis nepotism might be true on some level, but try thinking about it another way.\n\nSurgical residencies for example, need to take someone for 5 years. \n\n5 years is a long ass time, and it's really really important that the resident isn't a jerk, is reliable, is able to do the job, and has an overall good attitude. \n\nWhat better way to evaluate  someone's character and abilities than by taking the word of someone you know and trust? \n\nAlso, as a non-traditional who has worked plenty of other jobs, this is how ALL hiring processes work to some degree. \n\nIt's worthwhile to accept this reality and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLesson 2: Research can be a HUGE waste of time; tread cautiously\n\nSince the real currency of matching is reputation/relationships, it follows that Research is NOT necessary. \n\n**Let me say this again. Research is NOT necessary!**\n\nThere are many ways to demonstrate your value to programs. \n\nDemonstrating clinical abilities on rotations is one way. \n\nProviding value by volunteering with national organizations is another way. \n\nResearch is just another way.\n\nResearch can very effective depending on your situation and goals....\n\nBut on the flip side, research can also be extremely **time consuming and pointless** even if you do everything right. \n\nYOU are responsible for deciding whether the investment is worth the time. \n\nYOU need to live with the consequences.\n\nWhat people don't tell you about research is that there are so many research projects that will NOT help you improve your reputation/relationships with people who have decision making power. \n\nFurthermore, there are also SO many research projects that get started that never even make it to publication. \n\nSo, on average, how much long does it actually take to publish a research project?\n\nHere is a (very) rough estimate just to give you an idea:\n\n1) Case report: 20-40 hours to complete initial manuscript, 3 months to publish if good\n\n2) Systematic Review: 40-100 hours to complete initial manuscript, 3-6 months to publish if good\n\n3) Retrospective Chart Review: 40-100 hours to complete initial manuscript, 3-6 months to publish if good\n\n4) Prospective Studies: Months-Years! You to complete initI'veal manuscript since you can be held up by IRB, institutional logistical issues, etc, also you need some follow-up time for most clinical studies in order to get useful results. Its best if you canI'mhop onto someone's Isomeone'sit can be must shorter. \n\nAnd this is all assuming that you've already sourced a project and have all the skills and abilities to push these projects to completion. \n\nSo, how do you know if a project is worth it? \n\nHere's are some things you can ask yourself:\n\nIs the senior author someone with decision-making power at a residency program you want to attend? Is the senior author someone who can write you a letter of recommendation that will provide weight? Are you academically stable / not failing? Are you receiving authorship commensurate with your effort? Is the project idea well vetted? Are you interested in the project? \n\nThe bottom line is, do not be afraid to say NO even if a resident offers you a research opportunity. I've experienced and heard of cases of residents who take advantage of medical students, make them do 100s of hours of work, only to put them third author on a paper and snipe first authorship for themselves.  \n\nThe bottom line is, only take time effective projects that will help you gain reputation/relationship with people with decision-making power.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLesson 3: Research is unfair, you may have to hustle very hard and even then, its not guaranteed \n\n**The research game is extremely unfair**. \n\nThose at top 20 medical schools will have access to unbelievable research labs where it becomes very easy to churn out research. \n\nThose who go to no-name school will often have no access to research.\"Finding research will be come extremely difficult. \n\nThere is no secret blueprint to finding research but here is what I did:\n\n1) I applied to dozens of research opportunities in my field \n\n2) I reached out to about a dozen faculty at my school who was remotely related to the surgical subspecialty I was interested in\n\n3) I started early in medical school to find these opportunities\n\n4) I always replied to messages immediately and took action to complete any task/project as soon as possible\n\nIf I had to do it all over again, I also would have focused way more on:\n\n1) Shadowing residents in my desired surgical subspecialty as much as possible\n\n2) After proving my worth, I would subtly mention research as an interest\n\nThis creates dual value of both proving yourself clinically and also sourcing research projects with PIs who are directly related to residency programs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLesson 4: Learn how to learn\n\nOnce you get on a project for the first time, it's going to be difficult trying to learn how to do new things. Depending on your situation, there may be nobody who tell you how to vet ideas, gather data, perform analysis, deal with IRB issues, submit papers. \n\nUltimately, most things in research you will have to learn on your own. \n\nYou may be tempted to ask your resident or PI all the questions you have. \n\nResist that temptation as much as possible. \n\nOnly ask if you absolutely have to. \n\nUltimately, people only want to work with someone who creates value. \n\nYou don't want to be the member on the team who constantly needs their hand held and is always asking a million questions. \n\nYou need to learn how to answer questions that move the project forward without asking the resident/attending. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n=======\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis post is not comprehensive about research. I decided to focus on what I thought were the most important points. \n\nI know questions you have will be very different depending on how deep you are into research. For example, I didn't talk much bout the nitty gritty of how to actually do research, like how to vet ideas, gather data, perform analysis, deal with IRB issues, submit papers, and finally more advanced topics like how to publish quality research, how to churn out many many publications from a single database, how to produce research without a PI. There was just not enough time to write about all of this, but if you think it'd be helpful i can write more about those topics too. \n\nAnd also, I have some free time for the next few months, if you have any questions about research, boards, or just med school in general feel free to DM me and I'll help as much as I can. \n\nI know not everyone has guidance in med school so just offering whatever help I can. \n\nCheers!",

You’ll get to do and learn so much with extremely smart people who love to teach what they do (for the most part, of course YMMV depending on institution). \n\nMost importantly imo, you also get exposure to some basic practical skills and procedures that you pretty much won’t do on any other rotation (except maybe EM) like intubating &amp; extubating, placing IVs, learning how to draw and give meds etc. All extremely useful skills I’m really glad I got to learn in MS3 rather than learning these as an MS4 on a sub-i. \n\nJust my thoughts, maybe I’m lucky and my rotation here has just been really good but it seems to be the experience for many who rotate through anesthesia.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/11auc4m/advice_from_an_im_intern_on_rank_list/",
        "text": "Hello all,\n\nFrom the deep depths of the r/Residency subreddit I have ventured back to r/medicalschool to give some advice on rank lists. Last year in your position I had waded through multiple rotations in anesthesia and IM and had not decided on a specialty until the middle of february. I had 20 programs on my rank list between anesthesia and IM including two combined programs. I had interviews to Upper middle tier IM, Anesthesia, and even an ivy league program. I also had lower ranked IM programs. I went to a low tier MD school with pretty average step scores. When it came down to making my final rank list, I ranked my low tier IM program number one much to the chagrin of some in my family. My IM program is about 90% IMG/DO and does not have in house fellowships in Cards/GI. It is in a good sized city and a tertiary care center but not university program. My mom and sister literally screamed at me on the phone that I was making a mistake and \"destroying my future\". Here are some factors that led me to my decision and a story on why it was the right decision which I hope can help some of you that may be agonizing on how to make your rank list. My top three programs all had very good vibes from the residents and the programs were very responsive and helpful throughout the interviewing process. In the age of virtual interviewing I know how hard it is to really get a vibe for things on a 3 hour zoom call. Here's what I would say you should think long and hard about.\n\n1. Financials: does the program pay for health insurance? Does the pay match the ability to live in the area on a resident salary? Do they have a food stipend? Is parking free? Do they match your retirement contributions? \n\nFor my program the financial aspect of things really isn't that great or horrible. I live in a fairly reasonable area, health insurance is good, we have a good food stipend and free parking, but no matched retirement and health insurance premium goes up if you have a family. Able to save money each month but not living it large or anything. They give us uworld but we have to pay for step3. \n\n2. \"Vibes\": sometimes those pre interview dinners are just incredibly awkward, the residents look tired or bored, or you just dont get enthusiastic responses. If a resident likes being at the program they really will try to sell the program. They have loyalty to the program and want to see good residents in the future classes. If they don't like the program they will not talk highly of it. These socials, while awkward regardless, you should be able to get a feel for the enthusiasm of the residents for the programs.\n\nFor my program I already knew the residents as a medical student and always got good vibes on how they liked the program. Doing the zoom socials now I always try to sell all the positives of the program.\n\n3. EHR. Title says it all. Epic&gt;cerner&gt;meditech\n\nMine is epic. If you do not know this send an email to a resident/APD. Epic is a huge plus since you also have nuance which you can use your phone for dictating.\n\n4. Call schedule/hours. You should know about how many hours the residents work per week, you should know about night float/24 hour shifts/whether its q3/4/5 call. You should know whether it is 4+1/4+2 or traditional. 4+2&gt;4+1&gt;traditional. Night float&gt;24 hour shifts. Q5&gt;Q4&gt;Q3. \n\nMy program is 4+1, no 24s, Q5 call. If you do not know this send an email to a resident/APD before ranking.\n\n5. Program faculty vibes. During some of my interviews I had some pretty \"meh\" conversations with PDs, some PDs really do give that friendly vibe. I had a couple PDs which just came across as boomer dicks who were stuck in their ways (shoutout to abott northwestern in Minnesota). I think if a PD comes across as friendly and accomodating in the interview, they are likely like that as PDs to the residents as well.\n\nLove all the faculty at my program, while some attendings I like more than others, none are mean or discouraging, the only thing I can say about some is that they are slow or pedantic. Our PD is one of the reasons I decided to rank my program so highly.\n\n6. Personal reasons. There are sometimes going to be personal reasons that are so important that if you get an interview at a program, as long as they aren't a dumpster fire, you will rank that program number one. Oftentimes these are related to location of family, significant others, or connections.\n\nPersonal reasons which I will not disclose to maintain my anonymity are what helped me sort through my top 3. My family ironically did not approve of my number one choice being my number one but it was the right choice (in retrospect).\n\n7. Fellowships in house. Decide if you have any subspecialties in mind and if the programs have those fellowships in house. If not then you will likely be subject to a chief year to match unfortunately (lost income/time).\n\nMy fellowship that I wanted was luckily in house. The ones they don't have I am not interested in. \n\n8. Location. For each person the location calculation will be different. I would say go somewhere that you have friends or family at least driveable. I think it would be pretty isolating to move to a region of the country with no friends or family. Some want big cities, some want rural, I personally prefer mid/small metropolitan areas (cheaper, still stuff to do, less traffic). Some enjoy cold, some enjoy warm. Just decide what is best for you in regards to location and try to rank accordingly.\n\nI live a couple hours from my college friends, have the beach and mountains nearby. Really enjoy my location.\n\n9. Hospital support staff: do your nurses and techs do their jobs or are you going to have to do lab draws at night because your nurse is either lazy or incompetent. If you don't know this I would email a resident if you are having a tough time ranking your top 3. \n\nMy hospital is a pretty mixed bag. Some floors are amazing and others are just atrocious. \n\n10. Miscellaneous. Really less important stuff but still makes a small difference in quality of life during residency. Unionized? Yes&gt;no. Call rooms, resident lounge, and computer availability. Nice call rooms and having lots of computer can be a positive. Education related stuff: do they give you resources? CME money? how and when are morning reports?\n\nMy programs call rooms are fine, resident lounge is atrociously awful, and computers are sometimes hard to come by. Overall not a huge negative but something we are trying to improve upon.\n\n11. Gut feelings. If you have a gut feeling about a program I would say it's probably right. Trust your gut. Ignore prestige if you feel that a less prestigious program will be where you will be happy.\n\nIf you've made it this far through the post I will tell you a personal story about residency that really hits home some of these points. A little while ago I got sick. When I say sick, I mean that initially the diagnoses that were being thrown around were types of diseases that mean I would die in the next few months-years. My diagnosis was ultimately treatable but the survival statistics for this disease are that 5-10% die of this illness even with treatment. When I was admitted to the hospital I chose to have my coresidents and attendings take care of me despite the option to be taken care of by those I didn't know. Over the past 6 months I have built a camraderie and respect for the program and our attendings such that I was confident my wellbeing would be best taken care of by my attendings and coresidents. Yes, sometimes it was awkward to tell my coresident that I did not do IV drugs or have sex with men, but it was the right decision. I told my PD what was going on and he and my chiefs asked if it was okay to let others know what was going on. I said it was okay and the entire program leadership and many of my coresidents made me a nice get well soon card, and visited my while I was hospitalized. I've received 6 weeks of paid leave and am now returning to work fully recovered. My gut feeling was right. There are many other parts to this story that really solidify that it was the right decision to stay here, but overall I hope the point gets across that gut feeling and vibes&gt;prestige.",
