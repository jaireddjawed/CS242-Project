I am aware that there were many questions about lightweight distros but nothing that would fit my use case (running only one tool, not for normal use). Is GNU/Linux even a good option or should I use something different?\n\nTo give a little background:\n\nThere is a tool called [MouseTester Reloaded](https://www.overclock.net/threads/mousetester-software-reloaded.1590569/) for Windows OS. It intercepts mouse HID reports and plots various graphs (latency, frequency, x/y count, etc.). Due to many running services in a background and rather high level api, it is not very precise and not really useful while developing custom hardware and testing USB implementation. My intent is to create a tool that would operate on low level, gather the reports and save them to file for further processing in a normal desktop application. As I don't really want to create a custom USB HID driver and other stuff around it, I was thinking of using some really small distro. I don't know if it's the right way to go and was hoping to get some feedback from you.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "I'll probably get shat on for this. But I've been trying to learn Linux off and on for the past 7 years. When it works, it works fantastically. But something that nobody seems to talk about is just how god damn hard it is to troubleshoot. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I've had issues in Windows that happen where I've had to flat out reinstall the entire OS because all the \"solutions\" didn't work. But with Linux, it's even worse. Let me look at it from a noob perspective. \n\n90% of the time on Windows, if something breaks or doesn't work properly, you can search your issue, and if you do enough digging there will be several solutions. Eventually one of them will work. Problem solved. And it makes it easier because if your issue is on Windows 7, 10, 11, etc, you can kind of filter it out. It'll be there. \n\nHaving multiple distros, versions, package managers, dependencies, makes it so much more fucking confusing to find a solution. A lot of the times it's just, \"Backup my data and reinstall\". What happens if you have a package installed that flat out doesn't open or work properly? You search, \"Snap version of Spotify not opening\". (That's an example). Oh, but this person doesn't have exactly the same issue as you, and they're on Fedora. So you type, \"Snap version of Spotify not opening Xubuntu\". Maybe absolutely NOTHING comes up, or the thread is 5-6 years old. It's fucking bullshit. \n\nLook. If you can force yourself you gather the extensive knowledge of the Linux base, those issues shouldn't be too much of a problem. I can agree with that. You do have to learn. But when shit like this happens, you don't want to. It pisses you off and makes you want to say fuck it and move back to Windows...and then go back to Linux 6 months later because Windows is doing stupid shit. But my point is, Linux is being talked about as the replacement for Windows. And consumers should main a machine with a distro. But how in the fuck is a consumer going to main a Linux distro when the stupidest things break sometimes, and the solutions require you to have an extensive knowledge of the OS and/or terminal? Windows solved that issue in 98 and XP. Linux has yet to catch up. It's close, but not quite. \n\nAnd for those who are saying, \"LOLOL you're just mad because you don't know enough about Linux\". No, I'm mad because if people want to treat distros like Ubuntu, PopOS, and Linux Mint as user friendly, simple issues need simple fixes. Otherwise, we need to stop advertising Linux as user friendly just because it has a GUI and a pretty package manager.",

I may boot this in several ways:\n\n* as the primary operating system for a desktop pc\n\n* as a virtual box vm running on macOS \n\n* as a qemu virtual machine running on another archlinux server (a)\n\n* as a qemu virtual machine on yet another archlinux server (b)\n\nAll three of these were working yesterday, but as of today the third has stopped working.  I have taken the following actions since the device was last confirmed working:\n\n* full system upgrade of the ssd itself\n\n* full system upgrade of server a\n\n* ungraceful dismount of the ssd from server a during reboot \n\nAt this point, the ssd continues to boot as the primary os on a pc, and when it does I can find the following journal entries referencing it:\n\n    Dec 21 09:14:10

I have tried several different mirrors of pentoo without success.\nI've formatted my drives to both file system without success.\nHere are my steps:\n1. I download the pentoo mirror\n2. Open Unetbootin\n3. Select to create from iso image and select my downloaded mirror\n4. Click to create the drive and one thing here that happens is that Unetbootin gets hung up about half way through the initial file gathering on a SQASHFS file. Then a popup appears that says that the squash file was already present.\n5. Click \"yes to all\" on the popup and Unetbootin will say it successfully created the drive.\n6. Restart and select the drive (which doesn't appear in boot options) from the boot override. \n7. This is when I get my black screen pop-up that says it didn't find any operating system on the selected drive.\n\nI've tried this several times with the changes I mentioned above with no success.\n\nDoes anybody else get this? And have a solution?\nThanks for looking at my question. \nI can provide screen shots or warning codes if needed I'll just have to run through it again to get them.",

Do you feel any noticeable difference in everyday situations and especially memory starved ones?",
