        "text": "Free/libre open-source software sounds cool, no doubt, but I feel like the rabbit hole that being interested in GNU and Linux has taken me down has deteriorated some of my joy in using a computer system.\n\nMy interest began in August 2021 using Manjaro Linux to try running Roblox via WINE after I had recently heard that it was able to do so. After messing around with that, I decided to take a look at some other aspects of Manjaro, interested in what it could do, and what programs were available.\n\nIt was fun learning what Linux could do, as well as some of the advantages over Windows that it possessed. You could use applications on a system with 1.5GB RAM usage total, compared to Windows being 4GB idle. Programming was much easier as you didn't have to get and install a whole SDK. Customizability was quite nice. Also having one facility to install most things was rather helpful.\n\nThen I got into distribution comparisons, gaining my dislike towards Debian-based distributions for their slow package updates, and towards Gentoo for its hours-long install time. I also initially disliked Fedora for their hard(-ish) stance on free software, since I wanted to be able to run Discord, but later disliked it for DNF.\n\nThen that took me into the privacy sector, and how most websites are bad because of their egregious use of JavaScript, and how software propriety enables spying and data collection for forwarding to surveillance agencies and big tech. \n\nThen that took me into hardware, and how management engines and Secure Boot are supposedly making it basically impossible to avoid the aforementioned surveillance and vendor-locking computers into using Windows, along with Intel and NVIDIA doing things generally anti-consumer like proprietary graphics drivers and locking features of newer Intel CPUs behind paywalls.\n\nThen that took me into init freedom, with growing disdain towards all distributions using systemd and how many applications and big name software rely on it. Cue new hatred towards the GNOME ecosystem (which I grew hate for with the introduction of libadwaita and the breaking of themes).\n\nThen that took me into \"bad\" programming languages; how C is the holy path and everything else are utter abominations for languages made by people who were smoking crack, and how you should avoid making anything in anything else. Related: musl vs glibc, reinforced by static linking.\n\nThen that took me into my phone, and how using that is making me further vulnerable, and how almost nothing other than stock Android supports my phone model and I should've been an owner of a PinePhone or something like that.\n\nMix all that, plus a few other things, and you get my state of mind wherein I have great dysphoria over the fact I currently am still daily-driving Windows 11 on an Intel/NVIDIA laptop and running proprietary software yet can't find a place in Linux anymore due to all the stuff I've looked at. I've acquired greater disdain towards society as a whole from the fact that they're okay with all of this.\n\nSometimes I wish I'd just taken the blue pill.",

        "text": "# TL;DR\n\nA curious question that came to mind - is there a tool in Linux that allows you to easily share files with other computers on the same network as you? I.e. I meet a friend in a coffee shop, we are both connected to the same wifi network, and I want to quickly transfer them a file.\n\nIf not, is there a specific known reason why not?\n\n# Background:\n\nI was watching the WAN show from LTT and they mentioned they were disappointed that Windows doesn't have easier file sharing where you can see other computers in your local network and just drag a file over to them to share it. Of course shared folders can be set up in a LAN and such, but if you meet a random person in a coffee shop and want to transfer them a file you end up resorting to a 3rd party tool (like email or DropBox or something).\n\nThis made me think \"I am not really surprised that Windows doesn't have it, but there must be some random project for Linux that someone made that can make this possible\".\n\n# The Question:\n\nI looked around a bit and did not find anything, making me realize this must be more complicated than it seems, so I guess my questions are:\n\n1. **Is there a tool that I missed that enables easily finding other computers on the same network as you and allows sharing files with them (like in my coffee shop example above)?**\n2. **If there is an existing project like this, why do distros not install and enable it by default?**\n3. **If there is no existing thing like this, is there a specific reason? Is there a technical reason that it is very hard to do/not possible at all? I imagine there is a lot to be concerned with from a security stand point, but I do not understand enough in these topics to know anything and I am curious.**\n\nNone of this is intended as a rant or anything like \"its 2023! this should be done already!\". I appreciate the hard work that is being done all around in the Linux and open source space. I know  that much smarter people then I are making these distros and tools and I am just curious to here insights on this topic.\n\n# Some Thoughts Of Mine\n\n* Can SAMBA/NFS be theoretically be installed on all Linux machines with a default shared folder that will allow anyone in your network to see and access it (using a password you provide), no matter if the network changes (as long as you are both on the same network)? If so, why is this not being done?\n* I know other tools like rsync and scp and things of that sort exist but that is not really what I am talking about. These tools need you to know the network details of the machine you want to share with (and don't identify machines for you to make things simple or allow simple drag and drop).\n\nThank you for reading if you got this far and I appreciate any thoughts/knowledge anyone may have.",

        "text": "One of the greatest strength of Windows/Win32 is that binaries will work on pretty much any version of Windows, whether its 10-20 years old or likely 10 years in the future. The only thing you might need is some VC/.NET redist runtime, and you will be prompted to download it or it will get installed automatically so there's no impact on the end user.\n\nThis is very different from Linux where there's no binary compatibility between distros or versions of a distro. This is due to lacking stable ABIs and ever changing dependencies which means everything must be built again and packaged in each distro's repo. And this is a losing battle which is why we have appimg/flatpack/snaps which have their own problems.\n\nIn Windows, you can keep a folder full of portable versions of apps along with their config. You can get portable versions for a huge variety of apps, including almost every open source one, and for software that doesn't offer a native portable version there's [portableapps.com](https://portableapps.com). These app versions can be updated easily, or you can just keep what works. And then it can be synced to any pc you want and everything is going to work. Settings are stored either in local config files or in %appdata%\\\\app, very similar to \\~/.config/app.  Its esp great when you have an older version of an app you want to keep around.\n\nI've used this exact same setup for many people and it works great.\n\nThere is simply no equivalent in Linux. Of course you can 'sudo apt/dnf/pacman &lt;list&gt;' and then git clone .config etc, but its not the same thing at all. You are not going to get the latest version of apps, in fact you are guaranteed not to in most distros, things may break, you may get a snap when you wanted a deb (thank you Ubuntu), and most importantly you have to redo it all with any update and certainly across distros. Its not a static reproducible setup. Probably works much better in something like NixOS.\n\nYou cannot guarantee an app binary and its dependencies will be available and work. You cannot pin an app version. This is a very real problem that the distro maintainers were unable to solve and why containerized app formats were invented. You simply don't need this in Windows. \n\nI'm not trying to say Windows is better. Of course it has its own problems like no centralized package managers etc. Linux makes some very different design choices, and every choice in software is a compromise. But I think its good to recognize strengths and weaknesses. I hope we can have a constructive discussion.",

        "text": "Title: Building Your Own Custom Linux Distribution: A Comprehensive Guide\n\nIntroduction: Building a custom Linux distribution may sound like a daunting task, but with the right tools and a bit of know-how, it's easier than you might think. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of creating your own Linux distribution, from selecting a base distribution to customizing the user interface and creating your own packages.\n\nPart 1: Choosing a Base Distribution The first step in building your own custom Linux distribution is choosing a base distribution. While there are many options to choose from, we recommend Gentoo or Arch Linux for their flexibility and customization options.\n\nPart 2: Customizing the User Interface Once you've chosen your base distribution, it's time to start customizing the user interface. One option is to use a lightweight window manager like Openbox, but you can also create a custom desktop environment using a tool like Xfce or GNOME.\n\nPart 3: Creating Your Own Packages If you want to create a truly unique Linux distribution, you'll likely want to create your own packages. This can be done using a package manager like Portage (for Gentoo) or Pacman (for Arch Linux).\n\nPart 4: Automating the Installation and Configuration Process If you plan on distributing your custom Linux distribution, it's important to make the installation and configuration process as easy as possible. This can be done using tools like Ansible or Chef to automate the process.\n\nPart 5: Adding AI and Machine Learning To take your custom Linux distribution to the next level, consider integrating AI and machine learning. This can be done using tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch.\n\nPart 6: Creating Mobile and VR Versions If you want to create mobile or VR versions of your custom Linux distribution, consider using tools like Flutter or React Native to build mobile apps, and integrating with tools like OpenXR or WebVR for VR.\n\nConclusion: Building your own custom Linux distribution may seem like a daunting task, but with the right tools and a bit of know-how, it's easier than you might think. Whether you're looking to create a lightweight, text-based Linux distribution, or a feature-rich desktop environment, the possibilities are endless. So get started today and create your own custom Linux distribution!",

        "text": " ‚ÄúJBD‚Äù stands for ‚ÄúJournal Block Device‚Äù ([https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/man1/pmdajbd2.1.html](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/man1/pmdajbd2.1.html)). ‚Äújbd2‚Äù is a kernel which is started by executing ‚Äúkthread\\_run()‚Äù function ([https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.1/source/fs/jbd2/journal.c#L277](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.1/source/fs/jbd2/journal.c#L277)).  The name of the kernel thread has the following pattern  ‚Äújbd2/\\[DeviceName\\]‚Äù. The code is part of a kernel module ‚Äî as you can  see in the screenshot below.\n\nMoreover,  as we can see from the code it is a file system journal-writing code  (part of the ext2fs journaling system). The journal is an area of  reserved disk space used for logging transactional updates. The goal of  ‚Äújbd2‚Äù is to schedule updates to that log ([https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.1/source/fs/jbd2/journal.c](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.1/source/fs/jbd2/journal.c)).\n\nThe kernel thread executes the ‚Äúkjournald2()‚Äù function ([https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.1/source/fs/jbd2/journal.c#L169](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.1/source/fs/jbd2/journal.c#L169)).  This main thread function is used to manage a logging device journal.  Overall, the thread has two main responsibilities: commit and  checkpoint. Commit is writing all metadata buffers of the journal.  Checkpoint means flushing old buffers in order to reuse an ‚Äúunused  section‚Äù of the log file ([https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.1/source/fs/jbd2/journal.c#L152](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2.1/source/fs/jbd2/journal.c#L152)).\n\nLastly,  JBD was written by Stephen Tweedie and it is filesystem independent.  There are different filesystems that are using it like etx3,etx4 and  OCFS2. There are two versions: JBD created in 1998 with ext3 and JBD2  forked from JBD in 2006 with ext4 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journaling\\_block\\_device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journaling_block_device)).\n\nSee you next time ;-) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k4ucid5xd2na1.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=14ee665bd13d4112ace809d852521c84b9eb4d8d",

On Linux the quality of YouTube/Netflix was always worse than on Windows. Its a bit pixeled and unsharp, even when watching in 4K quality on a 4K screen.\n\nBack then I googled for a solution but it sounded like there is none. I don't know the exact reason anymore but the conclusion was that it won't get better on Linux.\n\nIs that still the case? You gonna tell me that on a high-end pc with 4K display I won't be able to get a sharp quality out of YouTube/Netflix, no matter what? Just because I'm using Linux apparently?\n\nHonestly if that's the case, it sucks balls.\nSo... is there yet a way to improve this? Like changing browser, installing some proprietary stuff or even buying another GPU or whatever.\n\nAnd also: what's the reason for this?",
