        "text": "Let me rephrase, since you seem to be obsessed with ideological purity: I am so further from you that we cannot even be compared, you shit-smelling tankie. Tear down capitalism and what do you have? Everything built to reinforce capitalism, whether they be sports arenas, megachurches, or sky scrapers. Those come down next, and whatever else. Next comes disempowerment of the first world. Yes, I'm a third worldist, you woke college bro. And what do I plan to do? Spread anarchism on reservations. The average Indigenous youth, once able to realize how their community is still colonized and everything that lead up to that, will lean to anarchism. I know countless. The average Indigenous youth makes you look like a liberal. And we don't trust your state because the state has done nothing but screw us over. The revolution will be Red and you wokebros will oppose it, and will be pushed out when that reactionary part of you comes out.\n\nWe practiced socialism while you were tossing shit and piss and animal innards out of your windows, and wondering why everybody was so sick. We recognized the fragility of ecosystems before it was too far to go back. We have historical precedent while you have the contrary. Why wouldn't we become radical when we have experienced horrors you cannot comprehend, and know that socialism has worked for us? You are fucking nothing, shitlib.",

        "text": "his is something I've been trying to write for a while, its kinda rough. Let me know what you think.\n\nThe Kochs [historical background](https://np.reddit.com/r/KochWatch/comments/85xtfv/the_kochs_reason_magazine_robert_lefevre_and_the/?st=jmaeoyso&amp;sh=95a891c5) with [extreme elements](http://www.unkochmycampus.org/los-preface/), their father and attempt to control the Ludwig von Mises Institute, is well documented and Nancy MacLeans book examines their association with James McGill Buchanan.\n\nBut their contempory interactions and funding aren't as well understood or clearly documented. \n\nWhat they point to is the Kochs being a major influence on the promoting the notion that white people are under threat from dangerous minorities and permissive liberals, and the pipeline from libertarianism to anarcho capitalism to the altright.\n\n[Charles Murray, author of infamous The Bell Curve, is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute – one of the key Koch funded think tanks and David sits on the board of directors.](https://www.aei.org/scholar/charles-murray/)\n\n&gt;Garret Jones, an economist at George Mason University, the largest recipiant of Koch funding on college campuses with 95 million between 2005-2015 and earlier this year it was discovered they have in fact obtained control over the hiring and firing of faculty [whose recent monograph was positively reviewed by VDARE in July 2017. Jones draws heavily on the work of white supremacist and eugenicist Richard Lynn, and even personally thanked the Pioneer Fund figurehead in an article he published in the Journal of Economic Growth in 2005. In 2015 Jones delivered a lecture which argued that less democracy in the United States would lead to better governance.](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/stefan-molyneux)\n\n(You have to scroll down a bit to the timeline of interviews)\n\n[Florida Atlantic University professor Marshall DeRosa is a member of the League of the South and employed by the Kochs for their 'prisoner outreach'.](https://www.thenation.com/article/how-charles-koch-is-helping-neo-confederates-teach-college-students/)\n\n[Assistant Professor Jonathan Anomaly at the Department of Political Economy and Moral Science at the University of Arizona, which has received 1.8 million from the Kochs and 2.6 million from their associates, published an article, Public Goods and Education. Anomaly has discussed the value of exploring links between genetics and IQ of different racial groups, and the value of eugenics.](https://www.tucsonweekly.com/TheRange/archives/2018/01/02/libertarians-on-public-government-schools-from-milton-friedman-to-the-koch-brothers-to-ua-and-asu-an-incomplete-history)\n\nThese three come just from stories found on /r/KochWatch, considering how much money they spend on colleges, endowments they have provided, schools they have set up on campuses how many more are there?\n\n[The Kochs, along with the Mercers and DeVos, fund another think tank Young Americans Foundation that funded those lecture tours of Murray and Milo Yiannopoulos that caused so much commotion.](https://www.alternet.org/right-wing/rightwing-billionaires-are-intentionally-funding-hate-speech-college-campuses)\n\nAs the Jones link demonstrates Stepfan Molyneux maintains connections to Jones, Murray who is Koch funded, the League of the South which DeRosa is also associated with, and others in the emerging altright, which are all Koch linked either through direct funding or associating with those they fund, and so too is [Jordan Peterson](https://mobile.twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/968633924724256768)\n\n[In Canada, Rebel Media was founded by Ezra Levant – formerly he worked at the Koch funded Fraser Institute and did an internship at the Charles G. Koch Foundation.]( https://www.vancouverobserver.com/politics/2012/04/25/charitable-fraser-institute-accepted-500k-foreign-funding-oil-billionaires?page=0,1) And Rebel Media is a regular platform for Peterson. As well as the likes of Lauren Southern and Gavin McInnes.\n\nCharlie Kirks TPUSA [is also Koch linked.](https://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/who-funds-conservative-campus-group-turning-point-usa-donors-revealed-2620325) \n\nYoung Americans Foundation, TPUSA, Rebel Media, and another think tank that employs many Koch alumni [Speech First](https://www.thenation.com/article/dark-money-behind-campus-speech-wars/), Peterson, Molyneux, etc all promote the mantra of 'liberals' silencing dissent on campuses.\n\nThe academics provide the 'intellectual' underpining of the “racial realists” and altright movement, the think tanks work is cited to 'prove' there is a cultural war between 'us' and 'them', the work is used by the likes of Peterson and Molyneux and Kirk and media outlets like Rebel Media to motivate dissafected young people and provide the simple emotionally appealing explanations for what the cause of their problems are, and directing them on to the libertarian politics other elements of the Koch network promote.\n\nAnd for additional evidence, the high school carriculum they donate when schools run short of funding ([because of Koch backed efforts](https://qz.com/1245033/this-koch-brothers-backed-law-stops-states-from-raising-teacher-salaries/) to cut taxes that fund them): [1](https://www.theroot.com/millions-of-students-are-quietly-being-taught-the-koch-1823742091), [2](https://www.alternet.org/human-rights/what-koch-brothers-want-students-learn-about-slavery).\n\nWhat this should all point to is that the Kochs are not merely libertarians concerned with government overreach, but rather while we have no direct quotes we can nevertheless surmise from their repeated pattern of associations and funding that the Kochs are racists and seek to create a 'let the chips fall where they may' institutional-bias racism.\n\nAnd it should also point to a confluence of these academics and media personalities pushing a demographic to an increasingly extreme position that welcomes conflict.\n\nAs one of their pet academics once said:\n\n&gt;In support of building their own youth movement, another speaker, the libertarian historian Leonard Liggio, cited the success of the Nazi model. In his paper titled \"National Socialist Political Strategy: Social Change in a Modern Industrial Society with an Authoritarian Tradition,\" Liggio, who was affiliated with the Koch-funded Institute for Humane Studies (IHS) from 1974 to 1998, described the Nazis' successful creation of a youth movement a key to their capture of the state. Like the Nazis, he suggested, libertarians should organise university students to create group identity.",
