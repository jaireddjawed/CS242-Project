        "text": "I love hiking and I adore remote places like the deserts and wilderness in the western US, Alaska, and the Appalachians. When I'm hiking or traveling I always romanticize any piece of tech I come across. Things like network towers on remote peaks, the sensors that gather wildlife or environmental data, GIS equipment, remote observatories, even oil field work. Every time I hear about oil rig jobs I always wonder what their IT people do. I'd love to get an old 4x4 and drive to a worksite in west Texas or Montana. Or work at one of those remote telescopes in Chile or something. I saw oil companies are rushing to the Skeleton Coast in Namibia and my first thought was how amazing it would be to work there.   \n\n\nI have experience in Sharepoint development and your basic corporate data pipeline stuff. I know enough Python to get a job but I've been holding out for the right position. I've also been our top sysadmin for about 5 years. My previous experience was a service consultant for Harley Davidson so I'm used to communicating complex technical issues to rugged, toxic types.   \n\n\nI know those jobs have to exist I just don't really see them often when I'm searching. Sometimes when I search GIS jobs, should I try to focus on that?   \nMy dream job would be a remote consultant somewhere who goes on-site to troubleshoot.",

        "text": "TLDR: I don’t know if I’m just being a ~sensitive hysterical woman~ or if this is actually bad, I’m really demoralised and want to make things work if I can. Advice appreciated!\n\nMy current SM is something of a nit picker and micromanager. I’ve never had any problems with scrum masters in the past, I’m a very diligent and conscientious worker so I tend to pick up on any negativity from my seniors. I’ve raised this to my manager who told me to speak with my SM directly which hasn’t helped at all. Other members of the team have noticed and mentioned this without any prompting from me.\n\nA few examples of things that have happened within the last week:\n\n* during sprint planning I gave the team a proposed solution and explained it would be very easy to implement as it’s something I’ve done many times before, a few days later he added me to a teams chat that he had been having with my manager and a senior from a different team where he had been telling them that I didn’t know how to do it and asking if they could step in\n\n* a tester found a problem with one of the requirements of a story I had just put into awaiting test (*not* a failed test), SM sent an “Important!” teams alert message to the whole team calling me out for a failed test. He has never done this for even genuine failed tests of others. He knew that me and the BA were already aware of the issue and were working on it so it was completely unnecessary \n\n* when he asked me for feedback on how he was doing (he is relatively new to the company) I told him honestly that I felt he wasn’t giving me the benefit of the doubt a lot of the time and I felt that he didn’t trust me to do my work, his response was to throw a hissy fit in the next days stand up and ultimately blame everything on kanban and didn’t try to resolve anything\n\n* he decided he didn’t want to do a “proper retro” after a sprint that desperately needed one, when I raised one of my concerns and a suggestion of what we could change (which the rest of the team agreed with) he said “what do you want me to write that down? Can’t you just remember it?”… in a meeting an hour later our BA reminded everyone of the new approach and his response was that he didn’t remember us discussing that and that we would just do it the old way\n\n* every stand up he makes a comment about my contribution. I could have pushed a whole US and multiple bug fixes the previous day as well as give a clear plan about my day ahead and he will still make some snide remark. Whereas my colleagues can give half an update about nothing and he will be encouraging and positive to them.",

        "text": "I'm an international grad student about to complete my degree in spring. As is the case with every international student, I have racked up a bunch of student loans back in my country. The only sustainable way to pay it off would be to work in the US for a few years and then go back once the amount is reduced. Hence, I urgently need jobs. But almost every job description specifies that they will not sponsor a work visa. Even internships (they don't even consider that I can use my OPT to work for up to 3 years without sponsorship). Career fairs are no different. The representatives bluntly told me that their company policy bars them from considering international students for their positions. Why is this suddenly the case? I remember getting responses from companies in October 2022, and I've also been interviewed by companies back then, so this has to be a new development. Is this new policy here to stay? Is there any chance for us to wait this out? The timing of this development is so unfortunate is that its too late for me to maintain my F1 status by applying for a PhD, but I have no option of giving up as I will undoubtedly face financial ruin if I go back to my country without any sort of work experience.\n\nI have a GPA of 3.93 and my concentration is in ML. I've done a lot of projects involving ML but I have no industry experience. I've been looking for internships as a result, but without any luck. I am very confident in my knowledge of ML and I am sure I can tackle any questions in the technical round. But I'm not even getting a chance.",

I personally could spend 2 or 3 times more time working and still be within the normal 40 hours per week. Recently I just go through our project to find bugs or technical debts to not be idle.\n\nI wonder if anyone else has experienced something similar and what the implications might be. Is this a red flag that the company is struggling or losing clients? Is a layoff coming? We all work via contracts, so we don't have the security of full-time employment.\n\nI would like to know if anyone has any advice on approaching this situation with our managers. Should we voice our concerns and ask for more work or wait and see what happens? Any insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

You never know what they are going through, especially in their job/career in computer science.\n\nI asked my best friend/mentor, who works at a FAANG company as a Project Manager, this past weekend this question. He literally broke down in tears talking about how he missed coding and how being a project manager is not what it seems to be. \n\nEvery Sunday he prepares reports and upcoming stories so by 2am Monday morning, he presents them to the main headquarters of his team that are 6 hours ahead in their time zone. During the week, he has to oversee some software engineers that are slacking in their stories, over 25 repositories needed to be merged and branched properly, more reports, and do it all over again starting on Sunday.\n\nHe was thinking about switching over to a different team in his company but as a Senior Software Engineer but  he didn't know if he was making the right decision and wanted assurance from someone. \n\nI did notice a big difference in his demeanor ever since he was promoted as a Project Manager. He wasn't as lively, didn't have time to do some code wars or do our Friday coding sessions with me and I knew that just strictly coding was his passion instead of overseeing others as a project manager and that's ok! Being a Project Manager is not easy, especially in a FAANG company. There's a job for anyone!\n\nI told him to go for it and know what you truly wanted in this company as an employee. Today he's going to submit his letter of transfer to another team but as a Senior Software Engineer.\n\nSo I ask you all as well since this subreddit gives sounding and thoughtful advice: How Are You? How's everything?",

However, I'm trying to figure out a longer term path that will set me up with the knowledge I need to be a more well-rounded developer. \n\n**Quick background:** I'm a bootcamp grad and my background is almost entirely in front-end development (3+ yoe @ startups in React / JS / TS ) and though I'm not looking for a full-stack role in my job search currently, I'm looking to transition my way to over to full-stack engineer and have the skills expected of a full-stack dev at a top tech company before I start interviewing for it (sometime within the next 1-2 years).\n\nThat being said, for me, landing a high quality tech job is a top priority right now, full-stack or not, and leetcode (along with systems design) seems to be the biggest bottleneck for me in achieving that. I'm wondering at what point I'll need to invest more time into understanding and internalizing the skills of DS / Algorithms that Leetcode tests beyond the Grind 75. \n\nIs it worth investing the time and energy into completing a more thorough DS / Algo course? I'd hate to grind leetcode just for the sake of interviewing. I'm looking to morph this into a longer term, programming fundamentals curriculum for myself. \n\nI've seen some people recommend the DS and algorithms course by Princeton and I guess I'm just looking for reassurance from some more seasoned developers that it's actually worth investing the time into.. \n\nI realize a frontend developer will rarely need to implement solutions that are the equivalent of a hard LC problem, and for that reason I'm choosing to focus on Easy / Mediums for LC and dedicate the rest of my time to just learning more about web development topics in general and practicing system designs interviews. \n\nAny advice here would be appreciated!

A few questions:\n\n* Are layoffs mostly over? When do you think the bulk of mid/senior-devs will be reabsorbed?\n* I've heard people calling the current recession as a sign of lessening demand for web devs, as web has become mature and tapped out of innovation. Of course things can and probably will change in future (AI startups will maybe start reviving junior market, once post-greenfield, in 1-3 yrs), but my concern is that current market needs can be satisfied by experienced dev pool for \\*a while\\*, without much need for investing in juniors. When will junior (frontend) market recover, if ever?\n\nI'd prefer to skill up, rather than send out mid-level apps everyday for months. [How do I](https://imgur.com/a/UloKKZp) (yes, uncredentialed) prepare for when the market opens up?\n\n* I'm thinking of developing [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/10wn8gq/autopsy_made_a_spreadsheet_editor_from_scratch/) to completion in the next 3-6 months, and SaaS'ing the backend and maybe even the editor (iframe? session api thingy like Stripe's checkout session?). If I build out an ecosystem (landing page, documentation system, payment plans, etc.), can I frame it as work experience (&lt;2 yrs), even if there's no customers? I didn't plan on taking the project this far, but hiring seem so rigid and status-oriented nowadays, that reputation-laundering seems to be the way to get past recruiters/ATS. I don't like this idea, but it feels weird to be seen as 0-YOE.. for years. Cuz otherwise, what the hiring process is telling me, is that I should just make a few tutorial apps and pluck dandelions until I die of bitter, old age.\n* Or alternatively, should I start focusing on data engineering or backend stuff, cuz there will be more opportunities there?\n\nWould appreciate any advice.",

Bear in mind that I live in southern Europe, not the US.\n\nI'm a software engineer with 7 years of experience working for a very big company that is not a tech company but has a sizeable tech department. Right now I'm in a very comfortable position that is relatively secure (in my opinion), the main problem that I have is that I get bored as hell. I really don't enjoy all the bureaucracy needed to get something done and to be honest my motivation is not at its best.\nI get paid a fair salary, but it's on the low end of the range I could easily get interviewing around. Also during the last year the company has eliminated all the little extras we were getting before.\n\nDue to people I know in my same field switching jobs recently I decided to do some interviews to see what I got offered and I've received several offers from smaller companies. The one I'm really interested in is from a small self proclaimed scale up, they are offering me a 50% base salary increase with a bigger bonus as well. The company is 9 years old and supposedly profitable and growing. \n\nTo be honest my main fear is doing a risky move in this market and something going wrong. I'm also a bit wary about the small company life as I've have heard horror stories online. My previous experience in an startup was stellar, but that could perfectly be complete luck.\n\nI'm writing this while calling myself stupid for thinking about rejecting such a salary increase, but I'd like the opinion of some completely unrelated people.",

        "text": "**TLDR: Graduated from a good but not top-tier state college in May 2022 with two degrees in CS and Math (Stat), but a 3.4 GPA and no internships, jobs, or side projects, only the remains of a good freshman's resume: high school internship, full tuition college scholarship, national merit scholarship. Haven't done anything worth mentioning or even applied anywhere since graduating. What are the chances I can still get a CS job, how would I do so, what do I put on my resume, and what kinds of employers are likely to accept me?**\n\n\nI need some advice on how to proceed with my career, and about how likely it is that I could get a programming job, or just how low to set my expectations. I know that I'm an intelligent person, and I had a ton of potential entering college, but that has all gone down the drain since, especially since I began a horrible and long downward spiral in the fall of 2020, my junior year. \n\n\n*BEGIN self-pity that you don't have to read*\n\n\nI've long struggled with mental health issues such as low energy, procrastination, poor time management, delayed sleep phase, depression, and some social anxiety. I still managed to do quite  well academically, and had a period of three semesters in high school in which I was relatively happy, made tons of friends, got a GF, and did an unpaid internship at NIST. I entered college with two different scholarships and one and a half years' worth of AP credits (which enabled me to finish with two degrees). But then I was pretty stagnant and made a few mistakes in my first two years of college, and didn't get an internship, mainly due to procrastination and poor time management, and because I liked my free summers and thought I'd be fine just to get an internship after junior year. But once junior year started, I became paralyzed by procrastination and anxiety, and became more depressed. \n\n\nHere's one example which is indicative of the larger trend, and similar to other mistakes I made both before and after: I signed up to do a personal project for research for credit under a professor, but ended up procrastinating on it and ghosting the professor for the entire semester, all the while believing that I would still start the project and work 3x as hard to compensate for the missed time, until I finally gave up and took a W for the course on the deadline to do so; and this all started because the professor emailed me in the first week asking to do a Zoom call. I think this experience, more than any other, completely broke the faith I had in myself to procrastinate and still be able to make up for it in the end, especially for large projects.\n\n\nThis paralysis continued for the rest of college and afterwards, and my anxiety, depression, and grades only worsened. I briefly tried in the summer to update my resume and start applying to jobs, but even if I managed to overcome procrastination, I would always get so fatigued before making any major progress that I had to take a nap and/or give up. Soon after that I split up with my GF of over 5 years, moved back home, and I haven't talked to any of my friends or really anyone outside my immediate family since. In this time I've also developed chronic pain (including my thumb/wrist) which prevents me from exercising much, and more recently mild neuropathy, of unclear origin since I endlessly procrastinate on making any doctor's appointment that requires a phone call. The only mildly positive things I've done with my time since graduating are making some money on +EV sports betting, and doing a fair amount of reading about the various topics that I'm interested in, like politics, economics, AI, psychology, and biology. My programming skills have atrophied somewhat cause I haven't managed to keep a consistent practice going, but I'm still confident that I could get up to speed in any programming job relatively quickly, if I could pass an interview, but I've never done a coding interview, and the one (phone) job interview I've done in my life wasn't successful. \n\n\n*END self-pity*\n\n\nI've been getting more desperate to get a job and make money, mostly so I can pay for various forms of better healthcare, and so that I can move to my own place as soon as possible. I also feel more capable than I did in the past, although that's not saying much. But I've cut my weed use from multiple times a week to &lt;=3 times a month, and my sleep schedule and habits are getting a bit better. I'm also starting therapy soon. \n\n\nBut I don't know how likely it is that I can get a tech job, or how long it might take after I start applying. I figure it might be better and more likely to get a (summer) internship to prove myself, but I don't know if companies offer this to people who already graduated. I know that in this economy it's still fairly easy to get some low-paying job, but tech might be one of the relatively worse-performing fields? Even a job I like would probably be a rollercoaster for my mental health and time management skills, but a more mind-numbing job like retail would be the fastest possible route back to depression and anxiety, and make it even harder to make any progress in my free time. At that point I might prefer setting my own hours on Uber Eats or something like that, if I'm gonna need a long time and some side projects before I'm likely to get any tech-related job.\n\n\nAny advice is appreciated.",

        "text": "This was my first job out of college and they started me off at 85k which I thought was awesome. Working here, I consistently got rated with the highest scores by my boss, provided a lot of valuable work for the project and now I'm making just over 100k. I was pretty content with it because I felt like they saw what I was doing and valued it, and six figures was enough money for me to be happy with.\n\nRecently I became manager (in addition to still coding) and was given a few new hires to supervise. As their manager I can see what they make, and it's 95k fresh out of college. It made me feel like my raises had been nothing more than just inflation increases. It's really depressing to know my 3 years of experience and all my project-specific knowledge is only worth 5k.  \n\nI'm not sure what to do here. I feel bad complaining while making 6 figures, but at the same time it really kills my motivation to work. I have no doubt I could get away with bare minimum work for the next year and working 5 hours a week from home (they don't supervise us hardly at all). And I'd probably get like 1% less raise at the end of the year. \n\nI brought it up to my project manager who said we don't have money to raise salaries because of the economic environment, which is complete bs because we just hired like 5 new people. It makes me want to job hop, but I hear the market is terrible right now, which scares me. Anyone been in a similar situation before and have advice?",

I was hired as the sole Android developer, but as of the last 8 months I've also taken on the role as sole iOS developer. I've also been handling my own UX designs since our designer left. My apps account for about 99% of the userbase. We have one other engineer who has been there forever and is an ideal senior engineer. He primarily works on the desktop app and also handles API stuff, and isn't nearly as knowledgeable on mobile. \n\nMy tenure has been marked by success after success. I've single-handedly fixed all the major problems on mobile and radically improved all user metrics (review scores, crash-free ratings, etc...). Everyone agrees that I'm crushing it. But there's still plenty to do, as I have some long-term projects coming up in 2023 that are crucial to the company. \n\nI feel that my increased responsibilities and my accomplishments merit a pay increase. I think asking for a raise to $90k would be fair, but I realize that this could be asking a lot considering the current economic situation. I would definitely accept $80k.\n\nWe are supposed to have performance reviews every February, but they just didn't happen this year. I asked the senior engineer, and he didn't get one either. But he thought I should ask for one, as \"everyone knows how well I'm doing\".\n\nSo I'll have to approach the owner myself (via email I guess) to ask for a performance review. What I'm not sure about is:  \n\n\n1. How to phrase my request for a performance review\n2. How much of a raise to ask for\n3. What kind of negative ramifications my request might have",

Not only did it seem like they already had their mind made up before the interview began, but they even started asking why I didn't have a bachelors degree and made it seem as if it was a huge negative. I currently have over 3 years of work experience. Of course, I didn't hear back for 10 days after the interview and was ultimately rejected, but they provided absolutely zero feedback as to why.  \n\n\nWhy waste a candidates time (6+ hours in interviews) and not even provide an ounce of feedback afterwards? Also, why make such a huge deal about education in the final round? Just ridiculous lol..",
