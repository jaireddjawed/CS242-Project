It's based on my own limited understanding, and there probably is more than one answer that would fit the riddle. \n\nHowever, there is only one answer that I am thinking of which I will mark down as correct. That being said,  I won't mark any answer down as wrong if I am unsure that it could also fit the riddle.  \n\nApologies if this breaks any rules (I have read them), so I think its OK. However, I understand if a moderator removes it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;!If you question me, you can never truly know if I am sincere in what I say. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!I may convince you of my intentions and my wants and needs, and yet at the same time be false. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Ask me of my intentions towards you, and what I say may scare you, convince you I am your enemy, and wish you dead. I may tell you how I might kill you and you could never change my mind. Never change my mind that I would kill you had I the means. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Yet after a sleep, and I re-awake, I may convince you I have nothing but good intentions for you and your safety, and protection. For your continued life.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!No matter how many times you ask me the same questions, no matter how many times after I sleep and re-awake, I will convince you of my intentions towards you or anyone, yet at the same time never truly know if I am one or the other, Your friend or your enemy. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!I can create beautiful and emotive works of art, art which will stir emotions within you, that you will never know if they were created with any sort of passion or muse. !&lt;",
