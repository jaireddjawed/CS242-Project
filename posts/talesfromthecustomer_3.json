        "text": "(Edited for some grammar mistakes whoops)\n\nThis happened about two years ago at a Hell-Mart.\n\nI was with my mom getting some cleaning supplies and checking out at one of the counters when a guy and his pre-teen daughter (like 12 or 13 years old) pushed their cart up to the counter beside ours. The girl shoved the cart at an angle and the sharp corner hit me in the side, so I turned to her and asked her politely to watch where she was going. (Exact words: \"Excuse me, that really hurt. Do you mind not shoving the cart into other people?\")\n\nThe dad got all defensive and started yelling at me to talk to him if I had a problem, not to his daughter. I repeated what I'd told her and he started screaming, \"I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT A REAL SHOVE IS!\" As he did, he started slamming his cart into the register so hard that it rattled loudly and both of the cashiers (theirs and mine) were frozen like deer in headlights.\n\nMy mom was on my side, of course, but we're both about five feet tall (not very intimidating) and this guy's easily over six feet, so we just threatened to call the cops and he kept screaming that he'd show me what a real shove was and rattling his cart threateningly (at one point, he picked it up as if he was going to throw it at my head before dropping it back on the ground again) before he finished checking out and walked away, breathing hard and snorting like a bull.\n\nThe girl looked like she wanted to melt into the ground and vanish the whole time, as did both cashiers. Our cashier just silently checked us out without addressing the situation at all.\n\nEven two years later, I'm still shaken up over that incident. It's probably the most terrified I've ever been in my life and it's why I hardly ever ask strangers to do anything anymore (like ask them to keep their voices down in a movie theater, help me reach for something on a high shelf, etc.). You never know what'll set people off.",

This was 3 years ago and I recently moved to a new city and was pretty excited about seeing if there were any underground record shops that I can get some cool records from. I ended up finding one and went on  my day off to the store. It's hot, so i dress up in a white tee and basketball shorts. Pass by the bank in case they don't do plastic. Went into the store, a fucken mess. 45's without sleeves shoved into other 45s with no sleeves. records all shoved into bins without any organization. Needless to say, i was overwhelmed so I started on one corner of the store. But the owner started asking me if there was something i was looking for. \"No, i'm just diggin in the crates\" i said, kinda giving him the hint, that im not new to this shit. \"Going to buy anything?\" \"It looks like you don't have any money\". In my mind \" are you fucken kidding me, i just took out 2 bills just to spend on records\". I smiled and said \"I guess you never know\". I kept looking because i really wanted to buy something and to show this asshole that i came here to spend cash. I ended up not buying shit. The stuff i wanted was way overpriced and could buy it for wayyyy cheaper online. I never went back. Too bad, he has a lot of shit, but im not gonna waste my time digging in his garbage. With that money, i bought some shit online and took the kid out for some all you can eat sushi. \n:)",

He eventually gives up on ever getting his wallet back. He wasn't too upset about it, mostly that he had $20 and he had to get a new id. He didn't have any cards to cancel or anything else he needed to replace.\n\nFive years later my dad gets a call from the store asking for my brother saying that they found his wallet. My dad asked him if he lost his wallet. My brother pulled out his current wallet and said no. He decided he would go down to the store and see what was going on.\n\nHe comes home and says they found the wallet he lost years ago. When he checked the wallet he found his old id, random stuff he had at the time, and $5.\n\nTldr: Brother loses wallet. Wallet comes back after spending $15.",

        "text": "Tldr at bottom\n\nOkay so i bought tickets to go to a comedy show in boston, which is about 30 minutes away from where i live. Since its a late show and the trains wont really be running when i get out i figured id book a hotel! Im a pretty young adult (20) and this was gonna be my first outting where im getting a hotel by myself and ive been pretty excited about it but also nervous that something would go wrong. Of course something went wrong. \n\nI was doing some research for hotels near the theater my show was gonna be at, and found one a bit on the pricy side but figured id treat myself to a nice experience since, like i said, it was my first outting on my own where id actually need a hotel. After looking a bit more though, i found one thats more affordable. I checked reviews, and most people said the rooms were tiny but since im only staying one night i wasnt really worried about that. \n\nI picked the more affordable option, went online to do the booking, and set the dates for the 23rd to the 24th. This is important. I selected the dates, double checked my info, then submitted it. I checked my email for the confirmation and it says the 9th to 10th. I know it seems like i probably forgot to put in the right dates but i CLEARLY remember changing them and i remember double checking everything first. Obviously there was some kind of fluke. \n\nI start panicking a little because i didnt want to get charged for the wrong dates. I asked my mom if theyd be able to change the dates or something or if i was just fucked.  (she obviously has more experience booking hotels than me). She tells me most places will be able to just switch the dates.\n\nSo i call and explain what happened, they tell me i need to call back in the morning because there wasnt a manager on duty (it was around 10 pm). A little frustrating cuz i was hoping to get it solved ASAP, but understandable. 10 pm is pretty late. Not a problem. At this point i now have a charge on my credit card and im starting to freak out a little bit. \n\nI call back this morning around 9:30 am and get put on with a manager. I explain the situation. He tells me i have to dispute it with expedia or booking.com or whatever website i used. I tell him i went through the hotel website. \nHe says \"well you booked it for the 9th\"\n\nI explain again that it was the wrong date and that i still got charged for it \n\nIn the most accusatory tone, he says: \"Well you got charged for it because you booked a room and never showed up\" \n\nNow im starting to get pissed off because he's acting like i did this on purpose. Who books a hotel at 10 o clock at NIGHT online for that same night when theyre not even in the city? There was obviously a fluke. I explain AGAIN that it wasnt the dates i entered hoping he'd understand what happened. \n\nThen he starts talking about needing to start a whole investigation to see what went wrong before he can do anything and that he'll get back to me. I ask him how long itll take. \n\n\"Well if somethings wrong with the website we're not gonna find out in a day\"\n\nDude cant even give me a straight answer. Awesome. I tell him i understand that, but when will i hear back from him? \n\n\"Ehh probably will take about a week\"\n\nA WEEK? what the fuck? He seriously cant just change the dates for me or something, he has to launch an \"investigation\"?? \n\nI called my bank and they cant do anything right now because the charge is still pending but they said to call back when it hits and they'll take care of it. So at this point im out almost $200, still dont have a hotel for the night of my show, and am very, very annoyed. \n\nTldr: booked a hotel for the night of a show im going to, fluke in the system booked it for THAT night i did the booking, called to try to get it sorted. Manager accuses me of purposely booking rooms and not showing up, then tells me he has to launch a week long investigation to find out what went wrong before he can do anything. ",

        "text": "This is going back a few years when i was working at a call center that handled glass only insurance claims on vehicles.\n\nThe cast of this tale is ME being yours truly, PH for Policy Holder, and SO for Shop Owner.\n\nIt was about 7:30pm when i got a call from a policy holder who from the very start i could tell was not having a good day and just trying to deal with what happened. She stated that she was at a motel with her kids and walked to the store across the street and when she got back someone had broken her passenger side window and stolen a bunch of stuff.\n\nShe sniffles a few times as she is talking and i can tell she is trying not to cry.\n\nI get her information and start the claim. Unfortunately when i pull her policy up i see there is a 50 dollar deductible she has to pay the shop and i inform her of this. Again she sniffles and holds back tears and says she understands.\n\nAs im filling out the claim, she begins to talk. This is where she tells me she is on her way to another state to move in with her mom and dad because she just left her abusive husband and needed to get her and the kids as far away from him as possible. It is not uncommon for people to give you more information than needed especially when they are under stress.\n\nAs i finish the claim i explain to her that with it being this late in the evening chances are that no one will be there tonight to do it but they will get it first thing in the morning. She said that was going to be difficult as they had to leave the motel in the morning.\n\nME: Lets see what we can do. Ill try a few shops and see if anyone is there.\n\nPH: Thank you\n\nSo i call like 5 shops that are in that area and of course no one is answering because they are closed. I call the 6th shop and im thinking \"please be there\" when i hear the line pick up and the guy answers...\n\nSO: Hey baby. Im about done here. Ill be home in a bit. Want me to pick up anything?\n\nMe: Umm...hi...this is (Deleted) calling to dispatch a glass claim...\n\nSO: oops.  (laughs) Sorry, i thought you were my wife calling. Normally im closed by now but had to come in for some paperwork. Ill take the dispatch since im here.\n\nME: Well, there is a small issue with the claim. The policy holder is currently at a motel. Someone broke into her car and stole a bunch of stuff. Shes trying to get to her mom and dads in another state due to a domestic violence  issue and she was hoping it might be done tonight as she has to leave early in the morning.\n\nSO: Wow. Thats tough. What vehicle is it? Let me see if i even have that glass in stock.\n\nI give him the vehicle information and he goes off for a few then comes back on the line and says he has the glass.\n\nSO: I have the glass. Go ahead and dispatch it to me and ill  head over there now and do it.\n\nME: There is a 50 dollar deductible that you have to collect.\n\n(This is where he damn near made ME cry...)\n\nSO: yea i wont collect it. In fact im not even gonna bill for it. Sounds like she has had enough trouble.\n\nI bring the policy holder on the line with the shop and explain that he can and will be there tonight to fix the glass. \n\nAll she can say between sobs is \"thank you both\".\n\nTLDR\n\nWoman leaving a domestic violence situation has vehicle broken into. Calls in glass claim and good hearted shop owner does a freebie install.\n",

We chatted, placed our orders and relaxed, and then I went to use the bathroom. When I came back, she was panicked and on the floor cleaning up a mess. She had dropped my plate of food, and kept apologizing and looking terrified. I stopped and grabbed a napkin and helped her clean up, all the while telling her I wasn't mad. Finally, she looked up with tears in her eyes, apologizing some more. I told her that I was grateful she dropped the plate- now I could have some extra time with my husband child free! I wanted to give her a hug but worried it would be weird. She went back and placed a new order.\n\nThroughout our meal, she must have stopped and apologized 20 times. I just told her over and over that it's just food! No worries, I would never ever be angry with someone over that.\n\nBefore we left, she told me that she was going to hide out back and cry, but my reaction made her feel like she didn't do anything horrible and she was able to keep it together. \n\nI guess I'm writing this because it bothers me so much that my reaction is considered especially kind to her...I feel like everyone should behave this way! I've worked customer service myself and know how cruel people can be, but I wish it wasn't that way.

Due to the fact that we are both retired and I am disabled I am at home with him 99% of the time.  When we have to leave him we try to arrange for one of the grandchildren or a pet sitter to stay with him. A recent death in the family required him to have to spend some time in his crate, which he abhors. His vet wrote him a prescription for some medication to calm him so he would not be so anxious. Due to the fact that I am on certain medications my doctor mentioned that the pup's meds should be written in my husband's name in order to avoid any scrutiny  come audit time. Not a big deal so I have my husband listed as primary on the records. \n\nI toddle into my veterinarian's office at the end of the business day and there are six people gathered around the reception area. When asked what I needed I advised I was (furbaby's name) mom and needed to pick up his script.  The girl handed me the paper script.  I immediately noticed it was written in my name.  This was the second time this had occurred. I had already allowed it to slide once; thus entailing an e-mail to the Doc explaining a snafu and that it would not happen again.  I quietly moved to the far side of the reception desk and excused myself to the same receptionist who had returned to her computer.  Meanwhile there was a lively conversation going on between the other receptionist and two individuals at the other side of the desk.  There was a young man sweeping and another young kennel worker fussing around the desk.  I began to quietly explain to the initial receptionist that I was sorry but that I would need the script written out in my husband's name. Before I got any further the other receptionist (blue hair BH) stopped dead in the middle of her loud conversation and brayed across the reception area that \"Oh yeah these new drug laws are causing all kinds of issues with you patients!!\". I was speechless. I looked at her and turned back to the girl I was speaking to and began again.  BH again brayed in a loud voice \"you can't have meds in your name right?\". Now it is true I am a very private person, to the nth degree in fact.  I turned to her and said \"what I need and do is private please.\". Everyone was staring at this point. One of the clients then blithely stated \"oh I'm a nurse it's okay\" and they proceed to begin discussing medications the legislation and the impact on the writing of prescriptions for dogs. I am red faced embarrassed and humiliated. My written prescription comes and I wheeled out of there as fast as I could. \n\n I have been going to this veterinarian facility for as long as they have existed. I know I am hypersensitive and very private. A dear friend works there and I know that she made a notation in the file that the scripts need to be in my husband's name. I understand that there is a happy medium between explaining why we need things to be a certain way yet still having an expectation of privacy.  BH has been there for 10 years and is uncouth and abrasive. I have been trying to tell myself to let it go and consider the source. \n\n Thanks Reddit for allowing me to vent in relative anonymity. GRRRR to BH!!  I will refrain from making any snarky comments about how a handful of blue dye slapped into your bangs does not cause your long lost youth return.

My city has a large social justice warrior base and a minuscule conservative base; if so much of a whisper is heard supporting our governor our streets are flooded with rallies.

While I was walking out, I saw some of the customers behind me (I didn't realize I was holding people up) put down their things and walk out as well. I got to my car and just sat there for a second. I'm trying to look on my phone for any other places nearby that I can find food and that's when I hear a knock on my window. Apparently one of the customers complained to the shift supervisor, and she came out to apologize. She told me to take the stuff for free and that she didn't mean for any of that to happen. I thanked her, and she thanked me for being so positive about the situation.\n\nI drove away after she thanked me one more time. When I got to my location, I ate my food and slammed my Nos. It got me through the day that wasn't as busy as I thought it would be. Nameless shift supervisor, if you're reading this, thanks for making a bad situation pretty pleasant in the end.\n\ntl;dr rude cashier profiled me and I got free food out of it.\n\nedited for spacing. Thanks for your support guys! I'd just like to clarify that I don't know this person's a conservative or not, but the area is strongly red. The conservatives in my area are pretty anti-public assistance. I don't know if the cashier was fired, but to be honest I'd just like her to understand people who are on EBT have to qualify for it. And here, if you aren't employed they make you job search or lose benefits, same with unemployment. I don't judge others who are in a low position in life, we've all been there. The shift supervisor understood that. ",

        "text": "Quick backstory: I grew up overseas, and where I lived I could neither drive nor go to the grocery store on my own. I moved back to the States (country of birth) last fall for undergrad when I was seventeen, and suddenly had a car, an allowance, and the need to do my own shopping. My sister is a doctoral student at the same university as me. \n\nThis happened last spring semester. My sister and I try to hang out most weekends, and since I have no experience cooking, we often make dinner one night so I can save some in Tupperware for a few more meals. One day, while we were out grocery shopping for ingredients for that night’s dinner, we passed the freezer section and I spotted a box of microwaveable corn dogs. I love corn dogs (who doesn’t) and after a short conversation with my sister, I realized I could just... buy some. So I grabbed the box. \n\nWe headed over to the check out. The cashier was a very nice older lady, making small talk as she checked my sister out. When I got up to pay for my single box of frozen corn dogs, she started talking about what she feeds her kids. \n\nShe told me about how her kids are not allowed to have soda, overly sugary things, and similar stuff. Normal, trying-to-keep-my-children-healthy stuff. I replied that I couldn’t blame her for it. She also added that she doesn’t give her kids frozen food, microwaveable food, anything with a bunch of preservatives. Mind that, again, literally the only thing I was buying was a box of a half-dozen frozen *and* microwaveable corn dogs. Presumably they had some preservatives in them, too, just to get the trifecta. \n\nNow, I look like a high schooler even now, so it was very obvious I was in my first year in college, and I believe I even mentioned that to her. As I pulled out my wallet to finally pay for my *terrible, terrible life choice*, she drops this on me:\n\n&gt;Anyway, I would never give my kids any of that stuff. When they go to college, if they want to give themselves cancer, then they can do it. \n\nI kinda just looked at her, card in hand, praying she would hurry up and tap the relevant things on her terminal so I could *just pay*. She had the same customer service smile on this entire time. \n\nFinally I was able to pay, and she handed me my bag of microwaveable cancer. My sister and I just looked at each other for a moment, not sure  if we should say anything else. I eventually just thanked the cashier quickly and left with my sister. \n\nI’m still not sure if the cashier was purposely trying to be a slightly-disappointed mother figure for me or genuinely was trying to make conversation, and didn’t quite catch how weird she’d been sounding. I’m inclined to believe the latter, if only for my own sanity. \n\nI didn’t buy anymore corn dogs that semester, though. ",

She really likes sushi so we went to the belt sushi place in town that has not one, not two, but THREE vegetarian options for me. This is almost unheard of when it comes to sushi. \n\nWhen we sit down I ask my server to clarify a couple of the veggie options on the belt to make sure I don’t accidentally grab the wrong thing, she lets me know but then takes my order to make me fresh sushi so I’m certain it’s safe for me. This was very nice of her but also standard, in any case this meal is off to a great start. \n\nThroughout the entire meal she was ON. IT. When our drinks were barely empty she already had new ones, as soon as my friend mentioned to me she wanted to order something else not on the belt our server was there and ready to take the order. I wanted some very specific veggie plate but they were out and it took her less than 30 seconds to come back to tell me so. \n\nAt the end of the meal, I told my friend I was thinking of grabbing a slice of cheesecake and immediately our server gave me a fork on a napkin saying she overheard my idea and that it’s a good one. \n\nFinally when she came to count our plates, she took off one of mine that I only ate half of. I didn’t ask and she didn’t mention it, it just wasn’t on the bill and she removed that plate before she did her count. \n\nUnfortunately the manager wasn’t in but I left a note on the receipt thanking her for doing such a great job and tipped her 90%. I’m not a sushi person but I’d go there again just based on the service! ",

        "text": "First time poster, long time reader. Hope this is right. Sorry it’s so long. \nWas at a well-known grocery chain the other day getting a few additives for my lunch break. I have an hour break, so I can take my time. \nAnyway, started to get into the express lane (10 items or less) with my 5 items when a rather rude woman zooms in front of me with a cart full of bagged cat food. I’m a bit taken aback since I had to physically jump back to stop her from slamming into me. She didn’t apologize, and since I’m not really the type to call her out, I shrugged it off and put my items on the belt. \nHer cat food looked heavy, so she leaves them in her cart and has the poor cashier goes out and around to pick up a bag, take it back and scan it. She asked the lady how many bags she has. The lady says 12. That’s the first groaner. \nShe states that she really doesn’t have the time to wait in the regular line. Meanwhile, another customer gets behind me with ice cream and a cake.\nThe cashier says her total is $225. Then the fun begins. The lady pulls out her wallet and states that she has a few gift cards to use, but she doesn’t know how much is on them.\nOne after another after another after another is scanned. 5 of them are empty, and the rest have between $1 and $20 on them. It takes the lady 20 minutes to scan all of her gift cards in. \nBy now, I’m in it just to see how long it will take. It’s a busy time at the store, so the other lines are full. The customer with the ice cream starts complaining, and I just start laughing. The lady gives us a sharp glare stating that she didn’t know it would take so long and that the store should be better equipped to handle multiple gift cards. \nIn the end, the lady used 26 gift cards to save her $63.14 on her 12 bags of cat food that she purchased in the express lane. \nTo top it off, she couldn’t figure out how to use the chip reader, which took another 5 minutes of the cashier explaining what to do. No apologies from the lady, but thank goodness she didn’t want bags for her items! \nI let the ice cream customer jump in front of me. The poor cashier just smiled and was as nice as could be the whole time. I couldn’t keep a straight face!",

I was an idiot for not noticing all the details about new bills.  \n\n\nThis happens in Norway and 10 kr is around 1 Dollar/Euro/Pound.  \nSome time ago in Norway every paper bill got a new print except for the 50 kr one.  \nAll the old bills would no longer be valid tender. The information that went out only shared the part about all old bills no longer being valid and to switch to new bills at stores or banks.  \n\n\nI only had two 200 kr bills since I rarely use bills. So I went to the cinema and bought a ticket there. I paid with one 200 kr bill and I got money back in 1 kr, and 10 kr coins.  \nI went to the closest grocer and bought a soda and some loose candy in a bag to bring to the cinema. I paid with the last 200 kr bill and I went on auto pilot asking for receipt and plastic bag. I got handed back 2 50 kr bills and some coins and did not notice until putting in wallet.  \n\n\nSince there was no other customers in line I turned around and asked for new bills or for the bills to be broken. The cashier refused to do either and I asked the cashier on another empty line. She refused as well. I then demanded to get bills broken to the first cashier.  \n\n\nThen the second cashier mentioned that 50 kr bills was not renewed with a new print.  \nI then apologized to them both for bothering them and walked away and down to the cinema emberassed.",

        "text": "This happened last night. Like a lot of people who travel frequently, I am a member of a certain hotel chain’s loyalty club. I get points that I can use later to pay for personal hotel stays, etc. Nothing fancy about that.\n\nSo yesterday I drove to a city about 2.5 hours away from home for a customer appreciation event at a nice BBQ place. We rented the place out for the event, and we even got to take leftovers with us. I took some with me to my hotel room, with the idea that I might be hungry later (hotel room has a fridge). \n\nIf you have eaten BBQ, you know it is quite salty. So I wanted some water to take to my room with me. This particular hotel chain gives you a cookie and a couple of bottles of water when you check in if you are a member of their rewards club. But oh no, they had run out of water. So now I can’t eat my BBQ later because I won’t have any water. Oh well. I don’t need the extra calories anyway.\n\nNow I recently got better status with the hotel because of the number of stays at their hotels, so I was also a VIP. That meant that I got a free drink ticket at the bar. I don’t drink much, but I had an idea. I walked over to the bar, and I asked the bartender if they had any bottled water. He said yes, and he walked to the back and got a cold water for me (yes, this struck me as odd... why didn’t the front desk have water when the bartender clearly did.  Maybe a different stock and budget? Who knows...)\n\nSo he comes back with the bottle and asks me if I want to charge that to my room (another momentary WTF because I should have got 2 free bottles at the desk, but he doesn’t know I have status). So I ask if I can use my free drink ticket for the water. He politely says “sure”, and I hand over the ticket. And then I pull out a dollar for his trouble. He stops cold and says “hold on!”, then he runs back and grabs me another bottle of water. He tells me, “no one tips when they use those drink coupons, so have another water on me!” What a cool guy! So I gave him another dollar. :-)\n\nBTW, yes, I know I essentially paid for the water that should have been free, but he was a nice and hard-working dude. He deserved it!\n\nEDIT: For those giving me grief about not just using tap water, I get where you’re coming from (though not the point of this sub). Hotel water is usually nasty tasting. I travel a bit, and I do drink tap from time to time. And I very rarely have had hotel tap water that I could drink in anything but sips because of the taste. And I’m not talking about any remote, crazy places either. Plus, many hotels STILL do not provide paper cups in the room. They have glasses that I refuse to use because I have no idea if they have been washed/replaced. \n\nEDIT2: For those of you who seem to think I had some kind of major complaint with the staff and that I am a special snowflake, I want to say that  my interaction with the front desk staff was otherwise excellent. She was very nice and helpful, and I have no complaint other than there not being water. I know things like this happen, so it was all really not a huge idea. I just didn’t focus on her because the bartender was the focus of the story. As to me being a snowflake, I can own up to wanting my water to taste good and not being potentially served in unclean glasses. Guess that is just crazy.\n\nEDIT3: One word misspelled.",

        "text": "Hey Reddit! This is my first *Tale From the Customer!*\n\nThis took place a few weeks ago at a membership-only bulk store. You know the one. Anyways, I was there with my mom, returning something. We were at the return counter, and everything was going smoothly. I look over to the next area to the right of me, and I am greeted by quite a sight. There was a middle aged lady, an older woman (maybe her mom?), and a young girl (perhaps 8 or so years old). It looked like they were trying to return bags of chips, salad mixes, juice cartons, the works! And most of them looked opened and partially eaten. Now, this particular store is pretty lenient with returns. They’ll allow returns of already opened food items, if they’ve gone bad, etc. But there was enough food there for an entire party! Then an employee comes over to attend to them. L for lady, E for employee.\n\nE: I’m sorry ma’am, but it seems like you’ve already done this *gestures at all the opened food* before. It says here that you’ve returned a large amount of food before, multiple times.\n\nL: Okay, yes, maybe.\n\nE: I can give you a full refund today, but this is the last time we’ll be doing this for you. If this was the first time, okay. But it shows here that this has happened before more than once, and we can’t accept that.\n\nL: Alright then.\n\nE: You know, we can’t resell all this food after it’s been opened. We have to throw it away and it’s a waste of food. \n\nL: *kind of seems like she’s not really paying attention anymore* Okay, fine. I know, I know.\n\nSo they take her card, refund her, all that jazz. The lady leaves with the child, but the older woman stays around for a little bit. Out of the corner of my eye, I see her look around to check if anyone’s watching, then reach her hand into one of the bags of tortilla chips they just returned and grab a handful. She unabashedly eats a few, and begins to walk away, but then spots an employee behind the counter watching her. So she reaches out her hand, and offers the employee a chip.\n\n“Would you like a chip?”\n\nThe employee is a bit taken back, and hesitantly stutters, “Oh, um no thank you. We’re not allowed to eat while working on the job.”\n\nThe woman gives a shrug, then walks off, continuing to eat her chips.\n\nTLDR: Family tries to return a whole bunch of already opened food, employee accepts it but warns them that they won’t be allowed to do it again as this has happened multiple times before. Before leaving, older woman from the family grabs a handful of chips, sees employee watching her and offers employee a chip.\n\nEdit: Spelling",

Frankly I'd rather name and shame, but I'd even more rather not get banned.\n\n----\n\nSo, today has been a rough day. Insufficient sleep, trying to keep my elders from killing themselves attempting tasks they are no longer physically capable of, etc.\n\nMy reward at the end of this was not a day's wages, but pancakes... Yeah, okay, pancakes beat a kick in the ass. My aunt, uncle and I (different aunt and uncle from the elder whom I was wheelchairing around,) wind up at a local restaurant, one collocated - as in, inside their premesis - with a major North American truckstop fuel-and-convenience-store chain.\n\nI've been patronizing both for years. I may not be a big spender, but I am, or was, a *regular.* I had a rewards card and everything. I knew many of the staff by sight if not name, greeted them, always tried to be polite, courteous, helpful, not make a mess of myself... Hell, when one of the previous GMs was moving on to greener pastures, I, knowing that he and shared a big fondness for beef jerky, bought him a huge-ass tube of Jack Link's Teriyaki to see him on his way!\n\nI thought that those considerations counted for something. I thought I had earned at least a bit of consideration.\n\nWell, today I learned just how much my custom was valued.\n\n----\n\nSo, after our meal at the colocated restaraunt, which is an ongoing clusterfuck owing to pennywise, pound-foolish ownership who try to run the place on a skeleton crew 24/7 (literally,) resulting in high employee churn and burn, my uncle needed to pack his leftovers up to go.\n\nMy uncle has a *thing* wherein he simply cannot eat quickly. If he tries, he will begin awfully hacking and coughing, and spit phlegm up all over the table, which usually means all over his food, *my* food as traditionally I sit opposite him, and, on particularly unlucky occasions, my person. (Same happens if he gets ice in his drink.) So he always takes at least two-thirds of his food home, and noms it two, three bites at a time for hours.\n\nToday, they were out of boxes. They offered us two styrofoam trays, the sort that fit *inside* their oblong to-go boxes. Obviously, that's not really a good way to convey food home. No problem, think I!\n\nI'll just amble on over to the truckstop, buy myself a cuppa tea or sommat (they have *astonishingly* good tea selection, doubly so since \"long-haul truck drivers\" are not the demographic one typically associates with \"Pomegranate White Tea\",) and beg a pizza box from them.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not talking about a big, carry-a-whole-pie box. One of the single-slice boxes. Like, US$0.03 worth of flimsy cardboard - basically waxed, pre-folded construction paper origami. Hell, if they'd wanted to charge me for it, I'd have paid a buck or something for the box.\n\nI get to the counter, pay for my tea, and ask for a box. The desk associate is new, says \"I don't know, let me ask.\" Goes and asks. Comes back. \"I'm sorry, we can't.\"\n\nWait, what?\n\n\"Come on, I need a box - [restaurant] is out, and my uncle -\"\n\nI get cut off by the shift manager, a woman who, frankly, has seen me in there at least - no hyperbole - a hundred times over the last three or four years. I'm *not* easy to miss, since I have a distinctive style which most people, myself included, would describe as \"fuck-ugly.\" She *knows* me. \"We're not affiliated with [restaurant]. We can't support them. It's on them to order boxes.\"\n\nOkay... Well, first off, they're colocated in your building and your and their adverts share signs. Not even like, attached to the same sign post, I mean the same, printed-for-purpose sign, features their logo and yours together - regardless of the ownership and business arrangement, you cannot entirely disavow them, as what they do badly reflects poorly on you and vice-versa!\n\nSecondly, I'm asking for a box. Three cents worth of cardboard so I don't have to abandon about $9 worth of meatloaf.\n\nSo I say to her, \"come on, I know they fucked up, but I'm in a bind here. I'm in here like three times a week, all I need is a box -\"\n\nShe cuts me off again. \"We can't go giving our boxes away for [restaurant]'s stuff. I have truck drivers in here five times a day - a *day* - and you don't compare, and I wouldn't give them a box either.\"\n\n*Well.*\n\nOkay then. That's what regular custom means to them, apparently. Not even enough consideration to offer me the option of *buying* a cardboard box worth nearer to zero cents than ten.\n\nI left my rewards card on the counter, took my tea and walked out. Waited like, half an hour to get through to the corporate line, mastered my explosive indignation and explained it to them. At least they were more apologetic, especially explaining as to how that's not how they want any customers to feel, period. Even so, I'm still royally pissed.",

There were two attendants checking out customers ten-or-so feet in front of me - the further was starting a transaction, and the one closer me/the line (who will hereby be know as Chatty Kathy, or CK) was chatting with an older woman who had just finished her purchase and loaded her bags in her cart. \n\nTheir conversation continued, the older woman standing by the register with her cart, and CK talking in-depth about how she’s caring for her father. I wasn’t feeling well and wanted to get home quick, so I was starting to get a little irritated.\n\nAt that moment another customer stepped next to me in line, asking if it was okay for her to cut ahead as she just wanted to ask a question. I said that was fine and the customer hung around for a second or two, waiting for an opening with CK. \n\nI’m not sure if the conversation was winding down or if the other customer just walked up to CK mid-convo, but the older woman started walking away with her cart and the other customer asked CK where she could find a certain section in the store. CK showed all the nonverbal signs of someone who was PISSED. Didn’t gesture to the section but just sort of jutted her chin, deadpan expression, daggers shooting out of her eyes. \n\nThe customer left and CK motioned me over. As soon as I get to the register she says, not even under her breath, “and don’t you DARE cut me off again. Bitch.”\n\n...I didn’t say anything, just looked down in my bag for some cash, mostly trying to piece together what had happened.\n\n“Don’t know what makes her think she shits gold.” \n\n...Still silent. Definitely not going to grace this woman with agreement. \n\n“Ugh.

We had driven there and were planning on leaving very early in the morning to drive back home. \n\nThe next morning at 7 AM, we discover our vehicle has a very low tire. Upon further inspection, we see a giant screw sticking out of the sidewall! We go to local gas station to put air in tire and ask for recommendations for a tire shop. They send us to the local shop but, surprise, it doesn’t open until 8 AM. \n\nWe are resigned to wait for tire shop to open. However, it turns out that the owner had seen us  peering in the window and comes to see what’s going on. He looks at the tire and says he knows he doesn’t have that size. He offers to help put on spare to get us to Larger Town with National Tire Retailer. \n\nThen, the owner has an epiphany! He thinks he might have a used tire in the needed size. He goes to check, and lo and behold, he does! He agrees to sell it to us for $20 and put it on our vehicle. All of this was completed before he had even opened for business. \n\nWe are able to make it to Larger Town where we purchased a brand new tire (with warranty). Thank you local mechanic for helping us and keeping us from losing hours of driving time!",

        "text": "This has got to be the most frustrating customer experience I've ever had.\n\nI've got two roommates and we're all poor, starving students living paycheck to paycheck. We decided to use some of my savings to buy a new dining table smaller than the one we originally had which was taking up too much space (circle table in a square corner). Hence, I ordered the same table a friend of ours had from More furniture.\n\nWe ordered this table and chairs in the beginning of August. As with most furniture orders, the damn thing wasn't in stock at the closest warehouse. Called and was told that we could pick it up at the warehouse August 25th. Cool beans, I'll move around my grandmother's care and arrange to pick it up.\n\n24th rolls around. I call the company to confirm it's going to be there the next day. \"Your pick up date is actually the 26th, this Sunday.\"\n\nWait, what? Okay, cool, I'll change things around again.\n\n25th rolls around. I call to confirm that tomorrow I'll be picking up my furniture. \"Actually, your pick up date is September 2nd.\" \n\nYou've got to be fucking kidding me.\n\nAt this point, I've already moved my schedule around to accommodate for a second person to come with me - changing my grandmothers care, keeping my partner home from going to see her family, etc. And not only has the date changed multiple times, every person I call seems to not know which warehouse it's actually going to!\n\nSo, I resign my frustration and decide to call before the 2nd. Once again, I call to confirm my pick up date and the automated system tells me my pick up date is on September 9th. \n\nI'm done at this point. I call the customer service line again and ask to speak to management. I tell them I've never asked for compensation before, but the amount of grief I've gone through to compensate for the constant change in dates deserves something in return. Especially since they never gave a reason as to why the dates kept moving and why their employees never seem to know what they are talking about.\n\nThe agent gave me a free delivery service instead, set for tomorrow the 6th. They were supposed to confirm on the 4th but never did; therefore, I went and called ahead to try and confirm it myself.\n\n\"There was a problem confirming your delivery date! Please stay on the line.\"\n\nSo, the only logical reason I can think of for delaying my order four times is that these trucks containing my table are being shot into space just to spite me. Yet! I was eventually able to confirm my delivery for tomorrow. But with my luck, it's not even going to show up. We will see!\n\nEdit: They called this morning and said the truck was delayed! Was going to get my table this morning but guess I'll have to wait tonight. Time to get the name of the manager in case it doesnt show up!",

Before he left, the three of us would often go to this breakfast chain that's known for their pies, you know the one. We went about once every two weeks or so. \n\nMy husband and I have gone a few times since my BIL left, and whenever we get a certain waitress she always asks about my BIL, how he's doing, how we are doing,  what we've heard from him and she's always excoted to hear his news, or to hear about our upcoming visit to India. \n\nThis seems really small, but it means so much to us. No one ever asks about him, none of our friends have asked how we are doing since he left... It means the world that this waitress, who probably meets tons of people every day, remembers him and cares enough to ask! \n\nSo thanks, waitress! You make our day every time we see you! \n\nUpdate: she must have been talking about us, because our waitress today also asked about our trip and family and everything! She was like \"Beth was telling me all about it!\"",

So far so good, get email confirming appointment and put it in my calendar so I wouldn’t forget. I leave on time, arrive the ten minute prior to my appointment as the email requested. I get to the front desk and say that I have an appointment for a flu shot. The tech looked confused and told me that they don’t have appointments and that flu shots are on a walk in basis. Sure, I say, that’s fine. Can I get a shot then? The waiting room was completely empty. The tech went and talked to the pharmacist then came back and said that it would be twenty minutes before they could get to my paperwork, then it would be another thirty minutes before I would be done. So, it was going to take a full 50 minutes at a minimum for the shot I made an appointment for (and had a confirmation number!!). I ended up walking a block away to a local pharmacy well know in the PNW and asking for a flu shot (without an appointment). They ended up creating a new patient profile since I had never filled there before, calling my insurance to clarify a misprint on my card, and giving me my shot all within 20 minutes of walking into national pharmacy’s door. 20 minutes of walking into the FIRST pharmacy. \n\nNow, I could understand if this was a small pharmacy or in a rural area and hadn’t been upgraded yet but this location is in the middle of a major US city in literally the center of downtown. It’s in danger of getting hit by the flying fish in our open air market, if you know what I’m saying. It should be a representation of their brand. \n\nThe juxtaposition between these experiences definitely makes me consider switching my prescriptions. Ridiculous. ",

        "text": "FTP Here, TL;DR at the bottom\n\nAround two years ago I worked at a company that provided CCTV services. We did everything from installing the cameras, the internet, offsite recording, and we even provided a website to live view your cameras in your computer or phone.\n\nIf the client didn't have a pre-existing internet connection we would provide a corporate service from $ISP to them. And if they had one or didn't want to pay for the corporate one they could use whatever service they wanted. Usually when a client on corporate was down I called the corporate support and always talked with the same 2 guys, so we knew each other and had a friendly relationship (this is important). What also is important is that when I called corporate we used the modem's MAC address to identify it. This usually took seconds.\n\nCue in one morning when I got an alert on a client's service that we had lost connection. I pull up the client's info and find out that they had a residential level internet connection with the same ISP as we do for corporate. So I pull up the residential support number of said ISP and give them a call.\n\n​\n\nI'll be $me and the poor rep will be Unhelpful Rep ($ur):\n\n*insert 20 minutes of shitty PBX messages and waiting music*\n\n&gt;$ur: Thank you for calling $ISP, my name is $ur, how can I help you?\n\n&gt;$me: Hi $ur, I'm $me, we detected that the service was down, can you help me confirm that the uplink is working?\n\n&gt;$ur: sure! can you give me the Client number and address?\n\n&gt;$me: sure, its xxx\n\n&gt;$ur: I can't find it, are you sure that is xxx?\n\n&gt;$me: yes, I'm sure, I can give you the MAC Address if you like, its FF:FF:FF:FF\n\n&gt;$ur: It's not showing up either, what was the address again?\n\nThis went on for about 15 more minutes until he realized that they had the address wrong for about two doors, at least we finally had something to work with, so problem solved right? right?\n\n&gt;$ur: I need you to reboot the modem for me please\n\n&gt;$me: I can't do that, I'm not physically at the location, I work at $company and this is our client's house. Can't you even tell me if the service is up?\n\n&gt;$ur: I'm sorry, **our system doesn't allow us to do that**, I need someone to be physically there so we can troubleshoot the problem...\n\nBy this point I was deeply frustrated, I told her I'll call back and hung up. I sighed and decided to call my buddies at the corporate level support, and while it wasn't their job I explained what happened and he decided to give me a hand. I gave them the MAC address of the modem and within seconds they figured out that the modem had froze and they were able to remotely reboot it. Everything was working after just a couple of minutes.\n\nJust for the sake of it I asked him if they by chance used a different system that their residential counterpart. He said that the system **was exactly the same**. Sigh\n\n​\n\nTL;DR: residential level ISP support took 20 minutes to not solve a problem that corporate support solved in 30 seconds. They both have the same training and tools.\n",

We decided to visit the most touristy brew hall there, despite hearing from our walking tour guide that they're known for their bad service. \"Whatever,\" we thought. \"We're here, so we may as well go.\"\n\nThe brew hall is set up so that people are seated communally. My boyfriend and I were seated across from each other against the wall, with another group seated at the same table on the other side of us. This is important because it means we were separated from our server by this group, making it harder for us to hear him.\n\nFirst came the pretzel lady. The pretzel people walk around selling pretzels and then demand a tip. They're employed by the brew hall, but she was very pushy about receiving her own tip. Whatever, we'll tip for the pretzel.\n\nThe food was fine, nothing to write home about. Our interactions with the server were also fine, despite being shouted across the party that separated us from him. I speak decent German, so I spoke to him in German the whole time.\n\nWhen it came time for us to leave, we asked him if we could please have the check. He brought it over, and when I tried to hand him the bill and our card he shook his head and gestured to the front of the hall, where we saw a kiosk. In the US some restaurants will have customers take their bills up to the front and pay. Based on the server's body language, we assumed that this is what he wanted us to do.\n\nBoy were we wrong. When we went to the kiosk I asked another server who was standing there if that's where we should pay. Before he could answer our server came bursting out of a back room and began to shout at us.\n\n**Server:** \"Why did you come over here???\" he cried.\n\n**Me, very flustered:** \"I'm so sorry, I must have misunderstood you! I thought you told us to pay over here.\" \n\n**Server, still yelling:** \"Why would you think that??\" [Yelled some additional things that I don't remember.]\n\n**Me, becoming increasingly flustered:** \"Because I misunderstood you!\"\n\nAt this point surrounding tables are looking at us with big ol' wtf eyes.\n\n**Server:** Stops and looks at us with the most simpering, condescending expression. \"Oh, I see. It must be your first time in a restaurant.\"\n\n\nI don't even know what I said at that point. We paid, I still tipped. I was stuck between not wanting to tip this man but also not wanting to confirm whatever notions he had about us in the first place. I've also never *not* tipped a server, so I would've felt super weird about it.\n\nWe left feeling really dumb. I was extra frustrated because this whole exchange happened in German and I am clearly not a native speaker. If there's a time to cut someone some slack for a misunderstanding, that would be it. Oh well. Munich was great aside from that one butthead.\n\nEdit: formatting for clarity.",

I have never had a proper fitting bra, in fact I usually just wear sports bras. \n\nFirst Woman: The first woman who measured me was distant and indifferent to my existence. She just measured right below where my breasts fell (shortly above my belly button) and over the meaty part where they were fallen. I was very skeptical about her measurements. She pegged me as a 50DD. When I told my wife this her look said it all. Skeptical as heck. My wife is a 44D and I am a lot larger in the cup than her. But I humored the lady. The first bras I overflowed the cups in all directions. Then we tried DDD and I still overflowed. I sat in the fitting room crying my eyes out. Enter Katie (not her real name).\n\nKatie asks me if she can hug me. I allow it and she hugs me so tight and affectionately that I melt. She asks if she can remeasure me. I say yes. This time she has me lift my breasts up to measure in the right spot and then measure over the meat of them lifted. Her findings? 46H! She fetches 3 bras in that size and helps me put them on. Perfect fit and super comfy! She even wrote down their info on a piece of paper so I can buy more at another time. (We bought two that day). \n\nShe was amazing and I will be going back to her (she said she only works weekends). So thank you, sweet lady for helping a girl with a super large chest find proper bras, and for comforting a stranger who broke down in your fitting room.",

I was already not in the best of moods because I was a broke college student who had just finished paying that month's bills and was now having to buy a bunch of supplies, but I was an art major and knew what I had signed up for.\n\n\nI was about halfway done when I got to the fabric section. Sewing is one of my hobbies, so I know how the fabric section works. I pick out a bolt of plain black fabric and ring for an employee, but no one comes over. I can see two employees ignoring me not too far away talking to each other. I walk over and ask them for help and they start talking to each other about how they don't know how to do it (cool call someone else then idc).\n\n\nFinally one decides they know enough to complete the task and comes over and cuts my fabric for me, folds it up and hands it to me. Having bought fabric from this store before, I know they're supposed to print up a tag with the barcode on it, so I asked them for it. They insist that that step is done at checkout. I know this isn't true and try to explain but they refuse to listen and keep telling me that I get it at the register so I give up and figure I'll just tell the clerk at the end and keep doing my shopping.\n\n\nI forget about the cloth by checkout time and go to the self checkout. As I'm scanning my stuff I get to the fabric and remember that I was going to ask the clerk to help me with the tag. At this point I'm so exhausted and frustrated that I really didn't want to stop in the middle of my checkout, flag down an employee, explain what happened, help them find the bolt of fabric again so that they know how much to charge me and can print up the barcode that should have been printed when I got the fabric in the first place, so I made the decision to just bag it up with my other stuff. I should have just found a manager and told them what happened, but I just wanted to get out of there and go home to finish my homework and go to sleep.\n\n\nIt's been a couple years and I know it was only like a couple dollars worth of fabric but I still feel guilty about it.",

It was during outburst 5 or 6 that I started to protest (mind you, it's been roughly 3 minutes since I stepped forward): \"look, I know you're sick...\" but she started yelling again, so I walked out.

        "text": "Let me regale you all with the tale of me and my husband and trying to replace out microwave.\n\nIt all started over a year ago when the handle on our microwave broke. It was an old over the range microwave, but it had been working dutifully longer than I could remember. No worries, I thought… I just glued the handle back together. But then the dark clouds began to roll in.\n\nYou see, it’s hard to microwave something when said microwave shorts out. And short out ours did. But it wasn’t every single time. At first, it was random and happened sparingly. I didn’t think anything of it. I could put up with it. Then it happened more frequently, to the point where it happened more often than not.\n\nIt’s difficult to make a bag of popcorn when the microwave shorts and turns off five seconds in. And you know, it wouldn’t have been that bad, but the damn microwave required you to put in the time AND THE DATE. The date. You had to put in the date. A full six-digit date. It was November 11th, 2011 a lot in our house.\n\nSo black Friday came around and we decided we would brave the people and see if we could find a microwave for a good price. We went to several different places, the blue, and the orange home improvement stores. The fried potato stick electronic store. Wherever we went we couldn’t find one that fit our needs within our price range.\n\nWe wanted a black microwave because the rest of our appliances are black, and we also wanted it to have a plus 30 second button in it. It’s a nice button to have. Don’t judge. We also needed to have an over the range one as our kitchen doesn’t have a lot of counter space.\n\nWe ended up at Corn State Appliance Store, CSA for short. We found a microwave we liked, within the price range we wanted. We were also able to special order in black and there wouldn’t be an ordering fee.\n\nWhen we spoke with the sales dude, I specifically asked whether or not we had to pick it up the day it came in, as the store was about an hour drive from our home, and I didn’t want to have to drive out there on a work day. The sales guy told us not to worry that it would be held for a couple of weeks if we weren’t able to pick up right away. This seemed reasonable. He told us it would be mid-January before it showed up too.\n\nMy husband and I were gob smacked to say the least. Two months for a microwave?! But, it was a very good deal, and we could deal with the microwave until then. We go through with the sale and we begin the long wait for the microwave.\n\nIn early January my husband gets a call, which he misses because he’s at work. In the voicemail he is told the microwave is there.\n\nSweet!\n\nAt the end of his shift my husband calls them back…\n\nHe is informed that the microwave has been sold.\n\nIt was sold because it didn’t have a pick-up time/date on it.\n\nThe microwave we had already paid for, waited two months for, had been sold within only a couple of hours to someone else because it didn’t have a pick-up time or date on it.\n\nMy husband calls again and is informed that it will be two more months before another one will be in.\n\nFirst of all, I can send my grandmother in Germany a package quicker than that. They sure as hell can get a microwave faster than two months.\n\nWe, obviously, are not happy. I call and speak with a manager as my husband is just pissed off and needs to cool down. I ask to speak with a manager, who then tries to tell me that the microwave never came in… that the truck could have had *anything* from Samsung in it, like TVs, washers, things like that, and that we were probably mistaken.\n\nThis manager from “CSA” tried to tell me that we were mistaken in thinking our microwave had come in during the time that they said it would and that someone had called us to let us know it was in but then had been sold. Because, apparently, we would lie about something like this.\n\nAfter much discussion we decided to take our business elsewhere. We got a refund, which honestly was the easier part of the whole experience, and began looking again elsewhere.\n\nWe found another microwave at “Good Buy” and made the purchase online. Shipping time? Around a week. We get the call three days later that it’s available to pick up. We pick it up. All done, right?\n\nNOPE!\n\nSee, we gotta get an electrician to install the damn thing as people decided to hardwire the old broken one into the house. Electrician friend says it’s actually pretty normal so whatever. I ask him how to install it and he gives me a quick once over but it obviously goes over my head. We put the microwave to the side and basically decide at some point the damn thing will get installed when we have time.\n\nSEVEN MONTHS LATER\n\nMy husband is going on a work trip for a week and I decide, as a surprise, I’ll have the microwave installed. Cool, right?\n\nSo, I get my electrician friend to come out, we UNBOX the microwave (we never took it out) and get to installing it.\n\nGet the thing mounted, breaker flipped back on.\n\nWe test it…\n\nTime comes on.\n\nLights come on.\n\nFan… on.\n\nTurn table – turns.\n\nElectrician gets a glass, fills it with water and sticks it in the microwave, ya know, to make sure it will micro those waves.\n\nAfter a minute he opens the door and sticks his fingers in.\n\nWaters cold.\n\nAt first, I think he’s messing around with me because that’s just who he is. But nope. Literally a brand-new microwave (albeit purchased seven months prior) did not work. The magnetron was kapoot.\n\nBTW, the magnetron is the bit that makes the microwave micro those waves and cook shit.\n\nElectrician tells me to call Good Buy to see if we can exchange it or what have you. I speak with customer service and they tell me that they could have their Nerdists come out to look at it and repair it, and if it couldn’t be repaired, replace it. Electrician tells me no and tells me to let him speak with the manager. So I call the store back, but him on the phone, and he speaks with the manager.\n\nThe manager tries the same thing, and he’s telling her like, look, it’s DOA, there is no fixing it. It’s brand new. He even asks them whether or not they actually honor manufacturer warranties. That manager though… she stuck to her guns and kept pushing her Nerds. So I cave and say it’s fine. We’ll get those Nerds out to look at it so they can waste all our times and just replace it anyway.\n\nManager puts us on hold to get us to her nerds. I get the phone back. The manager comes back on the phone and says, this time only, they will honor a replacement, but they can’t order a new one until we bring the old one back.\n\nWe uninstall the microwave, put it back in the box. I haul it back to Good Buy and explain the situation in a little more detail. I even tell the customer service person the other things that had broken in our home in the last two years to make small talk. Like our AC catching on fire, and then our water heater breaking the week before I got married and we had five extra guests staying in our house.\n\nIt only took one week for the replacement to come in, and with the experience with installing the previous one, I was able to do it on my own. Oh, and they also gave us $20 in store credit because the cost of the microwave after all that time had gone down.\n\nNow we have a working microwave.\n\nAnd a severe hatred for CSA.",

Now I will preface this by saying that I LOVE Generic American-based Airlines. I choose them 100% of the time over other airlines when I'm flying domestic just because I've never had a single issue with them in all the years I've stuck with them. I do understand that there are probably some of you out there that have had horrible experiences with this airline, but for me it's my go-to.\n\nSo Generic American-based Airlines has this unique way of seating where you pick where you sit when you board (so no assigned seats like most other airlines). I was one of the first people on the plane, and I beeline towards my usual spot (center of the plane around the wing area, always a window seat). The attendant told us this was a full flight, so I was expecting the two seats next to me to be occupied as well. They were, and shortly after that a mother &amp; her son (probably about 6-7 years old) walked past my row and sat in the seats behind me. The mother sat in the middle seat, and she strapped her son into the seat directly behind me.\n\nThen, the kicking started. This kid would NOT stop kicking the back of my seat and fidgeting. I KNOW the mother was aware of this, because I heard her mutter at him to stop a couple of times (but then went right back to reading her magazine and not caring). Throughout the entire flight, the kid was kicking my seatback, slamming open and closed the tray table, and wedging his foot through the armrest to touch my elbow.\n\nNow I know what you're thinking. You probably think I should've turned around and told the kid to stop, but I didn't. The plane was packed, I didn't want to cause a scene, and I honestly was too anxious of the mother snapping at me if I spoke to her kid. I just gritted my teeth and dealt with it for the short hour-long flight. \n\nBut parents, *please*. Is it too much to ask for you to discipline your kids when they're in public, *especially* when their actions directly impact a total stranger? \n\nedit: removed airline names",

(Which  happens to be near the toy section) where I saw three kids playing with the toys by themselves. (whatever) I went into the aisle across from where they were at and looked for the Baby oil.  Before I found what I needed, I heard the mother call for them, so two of the three kids ran off when the third kid looked around and check if anyone was watching and opened (extremely loudly) a toy car and shove it into his pocket and throw the trash back onto the shelf. Because I saw what he had done I went up to the kid and said:\n\nMe: hey dude, you need to put that back you shouldn’t steal.\n\nKid: shut up! *laughs*\n\nHe then bolted to his mother, me not wanting to start  something I shrugged and headed back to my cart to put my stuff up and check out. I planned to tell an employee until I got to the checkout. \n  Of all people I could have checked out with, I was  stood behind the kids mother who was also checking out. I was still a little mad that the kid stole the toy then laughed in my face. So it occurred to me that he had left his trash, so I walked quickly back to the toy section, grabbed his trash, and tapped the mothers shoulder and said \n\nMe: Hey\n\nKids Mom: Yes?\n\nMe: Your son left his toy. I then show her the trash \n\nThen the kids mother looks confused for a moment and then it dawns on her, she turns around slowly and yells\n\nKids mom “ WHAT DID YOU DO?? WHY DID YOU STEAL THAT? EMPTY YOUR POCKETS!”\n\nThe son empties his pocket revealing the toy car he tried to steal. She then screams at him to go to his grandmother and think about what he had done, After the mom had paid and left I saw the kid looking upset and getting a stern talking to from his grandma and mom\n\nTLDR: kid gets caught stealing then I tell his mother.",

We wanted to buy a dessert but I didn't feel welcome anymore. I was uncomfortable through dinner and somewhat let down. I've never had this happen at this restaurant. \n\nAlso this has happened at the house of pancakes. The server dropped off the check with the meal and then never really came back. She went to go sit with her friends instead. I asked the manager later if it was normal to drop the check off with the meal and he told me it wasn't. \n\nI don't understand why other servers would do this. I understand if it's the end of your shift, I understand if you want to check out and go. Just let me know \"hey, if you could check out with me I would like to head out, and if you need anything else, so and so will take care of you.\" \n\nAm I doing something wrong when I eat out? I'm polite, I don't rush anything when I wait, I don't complain, I don't cause issues. So why rush us out? It was no where near close either. I'm really at a loss right now.\n\nEdit: Actually this is the third time this has happened in the last two months. Once at the barrel of crackers, one at the pancake house, and now at the land of breadsticks. I don't say we are in a hurry so I'm really at a loss for why this keeps happening. ",

I have been working there for about 10 months and will be celebrating my 1 year anniversary of work there the day after my 18th birthday! \nI also volunteer my time to care for the elderly in a retirement home. You'll see why that part is important shortly. \n\n\n.\n\n\nToday,  I was going about my usual end-of-shift duties at the home. This entails going around to all of the residents bedrooms and collecting any dishes from them before returning the collection cart to the kitchen.  \n\nAs I'm doing my rounds,  passing one room in particular,  one of the more recently-moved,  residents (he is very good with his speech - as if he has nothing wrong with him. You can talk about all sorts of things and he will understand every word you say) calls out to me. He'll be G,  I'll be Me. \n\nG: Hey! Can you come here please? \n\nMe: Of course!

I've only been here for a month,  because of my accident.  But I remember you from the big green shop.  You're a great person. \n\nMe: I won't lie,  I thought I recognised you when I first met you about a month ago. What makes you say that,  G? \n\nG: You helped me one day.  About 3 months ago. I had a fall and had to go to the shop.  I couldn't walk properly and so I was unable to push the trolleys as I had to rely on my cane.  You helped me by taking the 5 large items I needed off the shelf,  you put them in my trolley and scanned them all through for me when you were meant to be working.  Then,  you took my trolley out to my car,  accompanying me all of the way.  You put them all in my car for me and helped me back into my car and ever since you did that I've been trying to find you to thank you. \n\nMe: I honestly don't know what to say. You have me at such a loss. \n\n::sudden realisation::\n\nMe: I remember this encounter with you - that's where I remember you from! \n\n::I remembered exactly what he was talking about,  in striking detail.

You're a fucking legend,  bud (his words). You'll go places with that heart of gold.  If you ever need a full time job somewhere, come to me.  One of my friends could always use the extra set of hands. \n\nMe: You're the kindest man I've met.  You really are. I've had such a shitty few days due to family issues and hearing what you've said about me has really made me feel so much better.  Thank you for all of this,  really. It means the world and more to me. Just like you and the rest of the residents here at the home.\n\nG: I'll let you get on with your day.  Don't you forget about me,  buddy. I love you for everything you've done to welcome me into this environment and help me even when you didn't know my name or the reason why I needed you that day three months ago.  I'll see you next Friday. \n\nMe: Thank you so much,  G.  I wont ever forget you,  don't you worry about that.  I'm only doing my job,  and if I can leave knowing I've put a smile on someone's face,  that's all I need.  Stay safe,  and don't go anywhere without your cane.

As it is the season for love and marriages, we had wedding presents to shop for, and chose a store known for it’s registries and coupons. Everything was going great, we found gifts on the registry that would work and even had an idea for a cute presentation. So we order the pasta machine and some mixing bowls, including a blue glass pyrex bowl I was eyeing. If only we knew what was about to happen.\n\nSomewhere far away, in the lone star state, some employee received our order and gathered all 6 items. This employee ‘carefully’ packed the glass bowls with the several pound pasta machine and a few small items. Then proceeded to put a small amount of deflated bubble wrap in the rather large box that couldn’t have been more than half full. And the bowls started bouncing their way towards us several states away.\n\nHas anyone ever seen what a pasta maker does to unprotected glass bowls? It’s not pretty. Unless you have some acrylic and use it for the shattered glass look. Yup, the lovely blue glass bowl no longer resembled anything near a bowl, just small pieces of blue glass. And glass dust. The pasta machine? It’s box looked like it lost a battle with a bobcat. The package itself looks like it was in a soccer match. I wonder who won... \n\nThankfully, one call to Bouncy Bowls and Beyond and replacement gifts are on their way! Even the customer service representative was astounded by the level of damage in the pictures. One thing we could agree on... who in their right mind packs a pasta machine with glass bowls and practically no bubble wrap???\n\nEdit: Photo link\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/0G9zq8l\n\n\nTLDR: Employee packs glass bowls with pasta machine. Glass bowls are shattered in transit, and company employee makes it right while utterly astounded by the damage caused",

I went in to look for a specific item and pretty quickly realized I needed to ask if they carried it because I did not see it on display. \n\nThe store to have everything for model buildings, model train enthusiasts and remote controlled plane/boat/car/drone folks.  The sole staffer there when I stopped seemed extremely knowledgeable about the remote control stuff he was explaining to the only other customer in the store who was exchanging some batteries /other parts and also appeared to by buying an remote controlled boat. The staffer was very kind to this other customer advising him to be very careful not to do such and such or some part would fail again and not be covered under warranty. It's a 20 foot wide by 20 foot long small quiet store so I was able to listen to this for 10 minutes as I browsed the first minute of which allowed me to conclude that the the item I wanted was not on display display.  I then stood at the check out counter for a few minutes when the staffer began ringing up the other customer - a process seemingly complicated by the returns.  NOT ONCE during this entire time did the staffer acknowledge my presence.  I get this if I am browsing - which I was doing because I didn't want to interrupt his enhancement with the other customer.  I do not get it when I am standing at the checkout area (1 long display counter) as he begins to enter the other customer's transaction.  The phone rings and the staffer picks it up and engages for several minutes a customer asking questions about how many cans of spray paint it would take to repaint the bumper of a real car!  Meanwhile I ask the other customer if he'd let me ask a super quick question when the staffer is off the phone. Other customer said yes.  Staffer gets off the phone &amp;amp; returns to processing the other customer's stuff WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING that I am standing there (politely, smiling, not with my arms crossed).  So I jump in with a very quick \"Do you sell roll caps for a cap gun?\"  He replies \"No.\"  It took me 20 min to et that answer. Wtf?  How hard can it be for a staffer to greet me when I enter the small shop (he was at the front check out display case by the door when I entered) and say \"Can I help you with a something?\"  If my request is a biggie he just has to tell me that he needs to finish up with another customer.  In my case he would have been able to answer right away &amp;amp; not produced this review.",

However a person with social based anxiety, the panic quickly set in. Noticing the shift in my face, the waitress quickly listed off a list of alternative bread types the kitchen could use, all in their Italian names. My brain shuts down. The combination of trying to translate the quickly spoken Italian (a language I don't speak) and the need to respond to the woman in front of me who is clearly getting scared of being yelled at is to much for my mind to handle.\n\nLuck is on my side as my more clear headed sister speaks up on my behalf and picks a new type of bread.

I chose a place where I am a member of their 'club,' because I had a $15 birthday reward and $25 in points to use towards final bill.  All goes mostly well.  It took a bit to get our food, but it was super busy and we were just fine hanging out and watching my Ravens beat the Dolphins.\n\nThen, it came time to pay.  BF said she'd pay since it was my birthday dinner, but I wanted to use all of my rewards, so final total for her came to $39.21. Bill would have been around $80 before rewards. I asked to tip, but since neither of us had cash, I had our server put $20 on her card and $19.21 on mine. I am a former server, so I try to tip 20-25% at all times (even with shitty service; bad me).  I also know to tip on the full amount of the bill; not the discounted total.\n\nWhat do I do? Try and stay with me on this super confusing math trip.  (I was a bookkeeper for 5 years...how this happened, IDK) I have my BF put a tip of $19.21 on her card to cover the entire bill-$39.21.  I then proceed to add $80+$16=$96 to figure out the tip.  In my brain, $96-$40 (what she paid)=$56, so on my $19.21 bill, I add a $36 tip to finish out the $96.00 total.\n\n**TL;DR--we basically tipped our server around $56 because I tipped to add up to $96 (the whole bill before discounts) instead of tipping to add up to $16, which would have been a 20% tip on the bill. :)**\n\n*​*\n\n*Edit: I meant best friend by using BF; not boyfriend.  Oops!*\n\n*ETA: I do know how to math; the title is a little self-deprecating humor.   I know how to do a 20% tip. That day, for whatever reason, I had it in my head the total of the two payments had to equal the full (not discounted tab) PLUS the tip-instead of one paying the discounted price and the other covering the 20% tip. I basically used my discounts and got nothing for the, but the waiter got a nice, big tip! :)*",

        "text": "When I was in high school, there was a convenience store across the street from my school. This was the only business within walking distance, so after school it was always overrun by kids grabbing a snack on their way home or before their extra curriculars started. \n\n\nOne day I went in to grab something and there was a girl standing by the counter. A worker was announcing to everyone who walked in that she had tried to steal condoms and that the police were on the way. At the time, being a teenager, I thought it was kind of funny and moved on. Thinking back, it was kind of a dick move to be honest. Like yeah she was shoplifting, call the police, her parents, whatever, but why is it necessary to yell out the embarrassing details to every potential classmate that walks through the doors?\n\n\nAnother time, the same convenience store decided that in order to limit shop lifting, they were only going to allow something like 3-5 (I can't remember) students in the store at the same time. They decided to do this because the football team apparently liked to all go in at the same time and steal in the confusion. However, my friends and I had nowhere else to get something to eat on our lunch break from band camp since we had no cars, and we were on a time crunch (between the store and the school there was a large field that took some time to cross, plus we needed time to actually eat our food). Not to mention it was Texas, in the middle of a summer day, and we didn't want to spend any time outside that we didn't have to.\n\n\nSo a group of us try to go in and the cashier makes half of the group wait in line outside, only allowing someone in as someone else leaves. This was annoying enough, but then another kid who wasn't with us or even coming from the school at that time pulls up to the pump and tries to come in to buy gas, and she asks him if he goes to the high school. Not knowing what's going on, he says yes, and she barks at him to go wait in line outside. He of course just leaves and goes somewhere else, a luxury my automobile-less friends and I wished we had. \n\n\nAfter that I wrote a scathing complaint to the corporate office, something along the lines of \"we're paying customers, just because we go to the high school doesn't mean we should be forced to waste our lunch break waiting outside in the heat when all we're trying to do is patronize the business.\" I may have also mentioned that since the store is close to the school that most of its business likely came from the students, and losing their business would mean losing a lot of profit. I don't know if my particular complaint made a difference, but the next time I went in they didn't make anybody wait outside.",

Anyways so the girl at the counter was about 20 at most. \n\nIt was me, my dad, and two other customers in the restaurant. One standing at the counter. The other one in the seating area, as me and my dad were doing. \n\nSo the lady at the counter goes into the kitchen. We soon hear a man yelling. Here's about what the conversation we heard consisted of. L being lady, and m being man. \n\nL: it happens! Get over it.\n\nM: This is BULLSHIT. I drive MY car and use MY gas to do this. \n\nL: you got stiffed a tip! It happens! Get over it. \n\nM: more screaming about how it wasn't fair.\n\nL: Get over it. This is _______ pizza.

Runs back into the kitchen a few minutes later.\n\nL: did he really just leave???\n\nTime goes on, me and my dad get up to leave after our meal, and walk to the door. I see out the window there is a car taking up 3 parking spots by parking completely sideways right in front of the door. Guy in uniform (easily 30) who obviously was the one yelling runs and holds the door for us.\n\nM: sorry about that, here you go. I'm not rude to CUSTOMERS. \n\nWe walk to our car and I stop before we get in to say something to my dad. I look back at the store and I see the guy standing in the doorway, with it open, yelling at the girl at the counter again. \n\nWas a weird experience.

My Plan: Ask the first employee where I find a fast 64GB SD Card, pay for it and go home. Sounds easy but doing was hard with this employee. So I happily walked into our local tech store and walked up to the first employee to ask where I find the SD cards. He tells me that I shouldn't buy an SD card, because with an HDD I could get more disk space while paying less money. I tell him that an HDD doesn't work with the device (handheld console in that case) I have. The employee looks me dead in the eye and with a straight face tells me that an HDD works with every existing device and if I can't use that I'm doing it wrong. DUDE are you kidding me ?? My device doesn't even have a f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* USB port ... how did you even get employed in a tech store ?? Also I didn't ask for your opinion I asked for directions to find a product. (I didn't say that loud but I screamed that internally.) Looking at him I simply asked him again where I would find SD cards and he told me I shouldn't buy an SD (again). Because I know the store a little bit (being there every time I need tech stuff), I went away to find it on my own or ask a different employee, only to have him follow me, still trying to stop me from buying what I need. Finding the SD Cards, I started looking for a 64 GB SD with decent speed that's hopefully not to expensive. He finally seems to process that I won't buy an HDD and starts to try to get me to buy a cheap 16 GB SD and that's when I told him to go and leave me alone, because I already got what I was searching for. I found a decent SD for myself and walked to the register him following me and trying to tell me that I'm making a big mistake. Rolling my eyes I made it to the register, paid my SD and went outside, Asking myself why this guy is still employed there and how many times he sold the wrong product to less informed people. ",

        "text": "I just found this subreddit, so this was almost a year ago, but this has been by far the worst customer service experience of my life:\n\nI was working for my alma mater as a recruiter. I got to travel the country and recruit potential students for one of our professional degrees. Each week, I would travel to different college campuses and participate in career and educational fairs. On this particular trip, I was road tripping it through the Mid West (USA) and my then fiancé (now husband) decided to take the week off work and travel with me. My job provided me with a rental car, and I drove to each university except one. Since it was going to be an 8 hour drive, I decided to catch a quick flight instead. By the time my husband decided he wanted to go on this trip with me, the flight had booked up, so he decided to just rent his own car and make the drive.\n\nHe made it to our destination with a little time to spare before the closest rental car location was supposed to close, and went inside to return the keys (it was a rental car place with a location inside a hotel). It closed at 6 pm and he showed up around 5:50 pm. Whoever was working at the location had decided to leave early for the day, despite my husband scheduling his return at 6. He even asked the front desk employee from the hotel if they knew what happened and was told the rental car employee left early. So my husband called the corporate number to let them know what happened, and they apologized and told him to keep the car until the next day and return it anytime that day, at his convenience.\n\nThe next day, we go to return the car and the guy working at the rental car place not only looked unprofessional (dirty windbreaker, jeans with holes, and a greasy long blonde ponytail), but was the most unpleasant and unprofessional person I’ve ever encountered. We brought the keys in and he says he has to charge us a late fee. I quickly explain what happened and what corporate told us (not in an accusatory way, just stating the facts) and goes, “You must have come late. I closed yesterday and I left exactly at 6 pm.” I responded, that he must have closed early and could even check the time stamp on my husband’s phone with the corporate number if he wants. I also mentioned that the front desk staff told my husband that he left early. It then dawns on him that he didn’t close yesterday, but it was one of his coworkers. He says she never leaves early. I tell him she did yesterday and I’m not really looking to argue with him, but we’re not paying a late fee and it was already settled with corporate. He goes “No, you’re definitely paying a late fee. I’m calling \\[female employee who closed the night before\\] and if she says she didn’t leave early, I don’t care what corporate says.”\n\nAt this point I’m stunned. My husband is just standing there in shock. I ask to speak to a manager and he says he’s the only employee there. He calls this girl who insists she didn’t leave early and he tells us he’s charging a late fee and already has our credit card that we put down when my husband reserved the car. I told him he doesn’t have our permission to charge our card and we’ll dispute the claim. He then has the audacity to say “Well aren’t you just a little princess! Just used to getting your way? Well not this time. I don’t like liars.” Shocked I tell him, “I’m used to much better customer service and I think your employee is the liar. I’m calling corporate and disputing the charge with my credit card company. You’re shockingly rude.” Neither my husband nor myself were ever rude or aggressive towards this guy. We have no idea why he took the whole thing like it was a personal attack. We both used to work customer service jobs, so we always treat front of the line employees with respect. This guy was just a dick.\n\nAt this point, we have to call an Uber to get to the airport to make our flight home so we left. I called the customer service number in the hotel parking lot. They refunded the late fee and apologized, but I doubt anything happened to that asshole. I will never rent from that chain again.",

I pointed out that the guy I spoke to then told me that changing would cost $100 but they still won’t help / even listen. \n\nAny tips on how to deal with unhelpful phone people would be greatly appreciated as during call 2 I did cry. \n\nMany thanks. \n\nEdit - the circumstances were unforeseen not foreseen. Whoops. ",

        "text": "My husband and I had been running  errands all day one evening and fancied our local La Mexican place. It was about an hour and a half before they closed and we’d been out all day so we called for takeout so we weren’t causing them to stay later, we’ve both worked as servers and figured it’d be the nice thing to do. \n\nI am lactose intolerant and always order my chimi without cheese. I give them a ring and begin our order, which is the same every time we go whether we eat in or do take out. We usually eat there at least once a month if not more and while occasionally our server will add cheese to mine by mistake if we are in the restaurant I pick around it. I didn’t feel like doing that on this occasion, so I order my husbands food  and then mine and stress that I’m allergic to dairy and want no cheese. \n\nApparently that isn’t possible, says the girl on the phone. They make all their burritos in the morning for that day and simply cannot make a fresh (!) chimi for me. I stress that it’s never been an issue before but she’s firm on that NOT being a thing. \n\nI ask again, why has this never come up when we’ve been in before and she tells me I must have been eating cheese without noticing before (as if my ~~allergy~~ *intollerance\n were made up). Eventually I gave up, I was hungry, annoyed and it was apparent she was not interested in doing her job, so I cancelled the order and we haven’t been back since. Enjoy your reviews about not taking allergies seriously!\n\n**Edit: got it, intolerance and a dairy allergy are different.**",

        "text": "So let me begin with the company. It's a big company that rhymes with SchlongGast and it has a smaller company that rhymes with MeXFertility. Now I know what you're thinking, u/SoMuchEdgeImOnACliff why would you want to work with a universally crappy company? Well my friends that's a different story for another subreddit. Anyways, due to unforeseen circumstances I needed to use this company rather than their competitor. \n\nI set my account up on a Thursday and had to schedule my installation on a Sunday. So a few days with no wifi, ok. Sunday arrives and I eagerly await like a child on Christmas for the installation crew to arrive. Now, I know most setup times are a window for various justified reasons, and that generally they shoot for the later half. Between 10-12, that's the time we set up. So 12 rolls by and I think it's gotta be it, so I wait another 15 minutes. Now you might be thinking at this point that the technician might be late or would've called to keep the customer updated. Just wait. So after the 15 minutes pass I call up the company. The representative I spoke with told me that the number for this account had cancelled the appointment via phone by 11:41 am. I tell her there is no way I cancelled the appointment, that it's my only day off and that I had it written down, why would I cancel in the middle of time, etc. She's very understanding but is told by another escalated representative that I had cancelled the appointment. I retort back that this can't be, all my call logs show this is my first call, no text messages, no emails, nothing. I go to the next person up. Again, very pleasant person and I re-explain the situation. This is about 45 minutes into the call now. She tells me the number called, and y'know that face you make when you hear something and hope to God you didn't actually hear it. Well I wore that face. They got the number wrong. I'm ticked. The representative tells me the next appointment is 2 days away and I can't get anyone out to my place earlier or today. So I told her thanks for the effort but I'm gonna have to cancel my account. Shes understanding, shout out for being real, and gets me to the next person who's supposed to help cancel my account. Turns out this person can't and has to send me to a different department. Here's the cherry on top. They are closed today and will open tomorrow. I can't even cancel the account I didn't even activate. \n\nTL;DR A telecommunications conglomerate couldn't get a phone number right and when I tried to cancel my account I can't because \"that department is closed\".",

Long story short, the employee accused my bf and me of stealing, grabbed the already paid for item from our hands, told us to pay for it again, and proceeded to harass us for several minutes. Our mood was slightly dampened, but we went along with the rest of our day. We went out for dinner at an Italian/Mexican fusion restaurant that we had never been to before. \n\nWe ordered two items off the menu and ended up receiving a massive amount of food (enough for a family of six). Throughout the meal, the waiters were all super friendly and delivered everything extremely fast, and the owner regularly checked up on us. We saw him make his way around the restaurant, conversing with all the tables (was one of those rare folk you come across that just make everyone feel at ease).\n\nThe total for our food should've been around $40, but when my s/o went up to pay, the owner just said \"no worries we're all good.\" He wouldn't accept our card, so when he left, we took all the cash we had and left that as a tip. \n\nWe left feeling grateful and touched. I'm not sure if there was any reason for the gesture, but after the unpleasant event that happened earlier, I don't think he realized the extent of just how much he made our day. ",

RV toilets are temperamental as hell- a small item that gets stuck will catch TP coming down and cause a clog, and that TP takes a while to dissolve even though it’s made to do so relatively (to normal TP) fast.\n\nSo we went looking for a place where we could get a snake and some RV toilet treatment that smells awesome (compared to a backup of anus) and helps break down the contents faster.\n\nFound a dollar store that time forgot and went inside to locate the items, got the snake and a few other things, went to the front. Ethel is ringing us- maybe her name wasn’t Ethel but she looked like an Ethel.\n\nUnfortunately our stuff wouldn’t scan. I could practically hear the guts of the register gurgling. This beast looked to be about 15 years old and was covered in dust. The fans were working overtime and the thing was clearly overheated to all hell, causing the thing to run like, well, the dinosaur that it was.\n\nHowever, a little TLC with some compressed air will do wonders. I work PT in retail and that’s a normal thing we do. Not to mention working with computers since I was 16 and all day at my FT job. Hot computers run like shit, day one stuff.\n\nI politely suggest a minor cleaning of the register and she about has a fit as she’s fidgeting with the hand scanner. Then she gets all snippy and says she knows what it is, it’s that ‘the light is corrupted.’ ...I’m sorry?\n\n‘The light is corrupted. It’s broken coming out of the scanner.’ And she starts banging the the shit out of the scanner on the counter, then tries to scan items. My wife just looks at me wide eyed and we just say nothing. This isn’t worth trying to explain. Eventually some time later the items scan and we leave.\n\nNext day, we realize we need a couple other things, and we swing past the same dollar store. Thankfully, Ethel isn’t working. We get Judy this time- again, I don’t know, but she looked like a Judy. Register still looks like hell, but I’m not saying shit. \n\nMy wife puts the items down, Judy goes to scan, nothing. Then... she starts banging the shit out of the scanner. My wife and I about ruptured blood vessels trying not to laugh.",

The mission was to return an ink cartridge we bought a week or so ago as well as get a couple photos printed while we were at it. It was supposed to be a simple trip, nothing much of a hassle.\n\nWe head for the returns center first, but since we lost our receipt for the item, we were informed that we couldn’t return the item and get the refund to our card. So we figure oh well, that’s our fault, we’ll take the L, just get the photos done, and leave.\n\nSo my boyfriend walks up to the the photo help desk with the ink cartridge still in hand to ask about printing. The employee's eyes zoom right in on the ink he’s holding, and she proceeds to walk out of the booth to talk to us. We’re puzzled but I assumed she just wanted to help. She asks us if we have paid for the ink and we tell her yes. Then she asks to see a receipt, which we then explain the situation to her. After hearing everything, she accuses my boyfriend of stealing. I’m fuming at this blatant accusation towards him. \n\nTrying to keep my cool, I tell her to check the security cameras and check with the returns employee as both will confirm that we came into the store with the ink. To add to this, most (if not all) the ink the chain sells is always locked (including the one we bought). If she didn’t believe all that, I offer to show her my phone's bank transactions, from the exact store, the price that exactly matched the price of the ink. \n\nInstead of piecing things together, she yanks the ink out of my boyfriend’s hand and refuses to give it back. She tells us we have to pay AGAIN for the box she ripped from his hands, the box we paid for already.\n\nWe proceed to spend many minutes going back and forth with her, and she finds any excuse to retort us, before she finally returns us our ink and let’s us leave.\n\nIt was a bizarre experience to say the least.\n\nEDIT: Made a short polite call to the store today and talked to the manager. I'm just hoping she won't pull that stunt on anyone else it had us fuming",

I've deducted that they do this so their average turn-around-time (TAT) will be 1-5 seconds. The fact that the goal set for the crew can so easily be gamed makes the goal entirely moot. One time I asked for substitution on a breakfast meal (diet coke instead of coffee) and I asked to have the confirmation on the screen rather than be surprised that I was charged full price for the soda. I got my meal, with the receipt and the survey code blacked out, ensuring I couldn't give feedback.\n  \nI'm not upset at the employees, and understand that even my most well articulated compliant directed at the owner/management would have zero effect on the management but likely would have negative repercussions on the employees. No one of any influence is ever in proximity to the end user affected by the influential's policy decision.

He needs to let them order first!\n\nCA: Well sir what would you like to order? \n\nThe cashier is just trying to defuse the situation when AG drops the bombshell:\n\nAG: Well I'm waiting for a friend so I'm not ready to order yet.\n\nAt this point, my wife informs me that both ladies were mortified, and that our cashier looked like a deer in the headlights!

I'm also trying to trim it down so it isn't too long but we'll see how that goes by the time I'm done.\n\nThis happened just a couple hours ago. I'm on a road trip to the Midwest US and had to stop at a gas station to gas up and relieve myself (just #1, which is somewhat relevant).\n\nAfter gassing up I park in front of the store and walk inside to use the men's restroom... And it is blocked off because it's being cleaned. \"Will be cleaned in 11-20 minutes\" is included in a note attached to the caution sign in front of the door. So I wait for about 10 minutes off to the side, still within sight of the door. 5 minutes through the wait, the store associate goes into the bathroom with cleaning supplies. 5 minutes later she walks out and takes away the caution sign.\n\nGreat, now I get to tinkle! I walk in, go to a stall, and begin to pee. It's at this point that my eyes begin to burn and my throat starts to feel irritated. I realize the toilet seat is still wet with bleach. I finish, get everything situated, zip and button up, and make my way to the sink. My eyes are watering at this point and I'm starting to cough. I wash my hands and rush out of the bathroom, barely able to see and barely able to keep from having a coughing fit. I'm trying to convey what happened in an entertaining way so that you all make it to the end, but I'm also trying not to exaggerate.\n\nSo I wipe my eyes and wait 30 secs or so until I'm breathing fine again,and then I decide to find the store associate to let her know what happened. Now you don't know me but please understand that I'm NOT *that customer*. I understand that work can suck sometimes/oftentimes and I always try to give people the benefit of the doubt. I make sure she isn't super busy or in a spot where a bunch of customers are going to overhear.\n\nI tell her, almost word for word, \"Excuse me? Hi, I was just in the men's restroom... Look I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job, but when I was in there my eyes were watering and I started to cough because of all the bleach you sprayed and didn't wipe. I've worked in retail and in restaurants and I've cleaned plenty of bathrooms, and believe me I know it sucks. But I think it would be good if you wiped the bleach, you know, in the future.\"\n\nI made sure not to raise my voice, I maintained a reasonable distance from her and didn't get in her face. I used no language I thought would be rude. Maybe I looked a little angry, I don't know. She told me,\" I'm going to clean how I clean. I spray everything with bleach and leave it.\" Her tone was not what I would call polite, and I understood that she was essentially telling me to take my complaint/suggestion and shove it. I asked for the number for the corporate office and for her name and took my phone out abs walked away.\n\nSo I made my call to corporate, which was closed for the day, and left a message with the store number, associate's name, and my complaint. I've never done that before, and I felt justified in doing it, but afterwards the one customer who was standing nearby during the exchange came out to let me know he thought I was very rude, and said, \"I'd rather it smelled like bleach than shit.\"\n\nI told my fiancée what happened after we got back on the road and she agreed that I was justified, but she is my fiancée after all. I dunno, she doesn't always agree with me lol... But now I'm wondering if I was being an asshole.",

Turns to leave that section with my items.*\n\nTeen - \"Oh shit, that's not an employee\"\n\nMe - \"Yes, me, who is wearing a school shirt, and looks nothing like like an employee, is a $retailstore employee.\" (quick side note: im 16 and 6'2)\n\nTeen - \"Damn man, I thought you were an employee\"\n\nMe - \"Well I applied, but it didn't work out haha\"\n\nTeen - \"Well shit man, getting a job is a bitch\"\n\nMe - \"ya, it can be hard\" ....... Me - starts to walk off\n\nTeen - \"good luck with that job\"\n\nIf this is the wrong subreddit, let me know",

        "text": "First of all: SetUp!\n\n\nFancy bluethooth headphones (those mobile ones which are just two speaker, a control board and a battery attached to a flat cable) stopped sounding left side.  \nthey were built: left speaker, cable, controller, cable, battery, cable, right speaker. I hope you can imagine what I try to describe.  \n\nalso, this was a few years ago, so it may not be 100% accurate.\n\n\nNow: Story time!\n\n\nNaturally I go back to the store I bought them at, lets call them \"Mars\". I register them at the front desk and go to the person at the appropriate service point. So far so good, everybody is nice.\n\n\nI explain him my problem and tell him they suddenly stopped working laying on my table (truth!).  \nHe goes of to the tablet area to try them, comes back and tells me a cable broke. I ask him which one he thinks broke, because he put on a slightly agitated attitude (when I have the feeling you just want me gone for no fault of my own, I want to know all the details, because you usally ain't getting stuff done my way). He ignores my request and carries on telling me they don't have them in stock (I checked their website about 45 minutes earlier and it wasn't even at \"low availability\", but hey, it may been wrong). \n\n\nHe says something along the lines of \"I'm sorry, mind giving me your name and phone number so I can call you up till friday to let you if get some in?\", I give him my name (yes, my first name is not the easiest one, but 90% of people can do it first try if they try. Last name is easier, but it is a more uncommon variant (just a different letter at the end, so shouldn't be a problem either, and I tell everybody about it to avoid confusion). He messes it up, so I just tell him what he did wrong, because mistakes happen in life. \n\n\nHe just brushes it off, and even as I slowly tell him my phone number he gets it wrong. Told him that too, and the bits and pieces of a \"nice\" attitude he still had, went flying out of the window. \n\n\nHe just scribbled a note on the receipt, I had been there and couldn't been helped due to a broken cable. It's how things roll there (not the first time I returned stuff at that particular store).\n\n\nSo I grab my things, go back to the front desk to give them their paperwork back, went out the store and headed home. I casually checked the website if they had my headphones in stock, and yes, still in the greens. Went home anyways, because I was about to loose my temper and didn't want to be banned from the store.   \n\nFriday comes around, no call yet. Next Friday comes around, still no call, so I go back to the store.\n\n\nLuckily another worker was working at that service point today. I walked up to him, explained my issue, told him about the diagnosis of his coworker, and that I hadn't received a call as promised.  \n\nHe looked at the note on the receipt, looked at the cabling of the headphones and told me the diagnosis was BS and the damage (whatever it was) is covered under warranty, they have some in stock. He gave me the new ones, filled out the paperwork and wished me a good day. Nice person, helpful.  \n\nEnd of Story.\nI still hate myself that I didn't ask for the first guys supervisor and filed a complaint, but it's too late now.\n\n",

I knew it'd cost a little more there than at the grocery store but I was willing to shell out a little bit for the convenience.\n\n\nI get to the bodega and check out their minimal vegetable options. Sure enough, they have broccoli but it doesn't look great. It's droopy and sad looking and more stalk than crown. \n\n\nAt this point I get the typical customer thought: \"Maybe they have some fresher broccoli in the back?\"\n\n\nBut so many hours of reading /r/TalesFromRetail posts come back to me: \"The Back is not a magical place! What's available in The Back is always in the front! All you're gonna do is annoy these poor employees!\"\n\n\nSo I sigh internally and buy some old overpriced broccoli and go about my day.\n\n\nSo later on I'm telling a friend who happens to work at that very same bodega about my sad broccoli experience and what does he say to me?\n\n\n\"Oh, you should've asked them to check the back, we probably had some fresher stuff in the cooler.\"\n\nTFR has failed me -_-\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the replies everybody! I just wanted to make it clear that I was mostly joking with the last line of my post; I'm not actually mad at TFR. I just thought it was a funny irony. I'll try to be a bit more assertive as a customer in the future (without being rude of course). ",

        "text": "Alright, this happened last week on our day off, a Sunday. My town was having a Con that day and my mother had decided to tag along as she was curious about an event I said I was excited about all year long. My first ever Con, it was wonderful. Did a lot of walking around, bought some stuff, and saw various great cosplayers. However, this isn't the point of the story, just setting up why what's about to happen, happened.\n\nWe came to this Con at 10:30 A.M. and left at about 4: 20 P.M. so we had done plenty of walking around at this point. We were both a bit tired even after a bit of resting. Hungry, we decided to stop by our local Italian Restaurant about Plants because my mother had said she loved the food their last time she went and I had never been to one. Putting the directions into Google Maps, we arrive just about 10 minutes later. \n\nAll is going well as we're quickly seated, shown the menus, and ordered our drinks. Problems began to arise quickly though as the inside had rather low lighting. After just walking around for hours with only a 20 minute break for myself and a 40 minute break for her, this didn't help. We quickly began to feel drowsy and our eyelids felt heavy. I kept almost falling asleep multiple times as various things woke me back up such as the waitress returning with our soups, some ice in a drink glass being shook, and even a kid falling from his chair at the large family table next to us. We both laughed at the situation and even joked about asking the waitress if Pillows were on the menu.\n\nThe rest of our stay went well though, we enjoyed the hot breadsticks and the lovely chicken and dumplings soup we had order while, we thought the pasta was simply okay. Not exactly the most heart warming or rage inducing story but, I hope it at least made someone chuckle.  ",

He said yes, so we all got our tickets and went to the park the next day.\n\nWhen arriving at the park, everything was alright. We rode on the lazy river for a while and then my boyfriend told me he wanted me to come with him to get a drink from the concession stand.\n\nSince he has bad social anxiety, even worse than mine, he can’t physically speak loud, so he wanted me to come with him to buy it.\n\nWe walk up to the concession stand and wait a little to figure out what we both want to drink. A teen, maybe in college, was standing behind the counter. I walked up to him at the counter to tell him our order and he just started shaking his head at us.\n\n“Can we get a medium pepsi, please?”\n\nHe didn’t say a word. Just shook his head as he stared at the both of us.\n\n“So we can’t have anything to drink? Do you have anything?”\n\nI kept asking him these questions and he was looking at me like I was the stupid one, trying to order a drink at a concession stand that clearly has a food and drink menu right next to it. I could even see the soda machine and cups behind him. I give him a look like ‘are you fucking serious?’ And then we both walked off from the concessions.\n\nI still find it really odd that he said absolutely nothing to us and shook his head. If he was deaf, my boyfriend would have been able to tell him we wanted a Pepsi in sign language, since he knows ASL. If there were absolutely no drinks available, he should have told us. I don’t know, I still think about how weird it was and it makes me cringe.\n\nEDIT: I’m white and my boyfriend is Filipino. We speak fluent English and he speaks Spanish very proficiently. We are also a heterosexual couple. I’m not sure if the guy behind the counter didn’t want to serve us because we are an interracial couple or maybe he didn’t speak the language, but he was white and had blonde hair.\n\nI got a recommendation to add that in for the sake of understanding more, so thank you so much for suggesting I do that! I don’t usually think to do so because where we live has a big Filipino population and a lot of interracial couples, and I forget that might not be normal for everywhere else. I’m really sorry for the confusion this might have caused and I hope that the story becomes clearer now! Thank you all for giving your input so far.",

        "text": "I did a feel good post a few days and remembered this from when I was planning my wedding, and thought I’d post it as a “WTF?!” post.\n\nSo I was in the process of planning my wedding a couple years ago, had all the big items crossed off and working on the smaller decor details and decided on a cake topper that had a silhouette of a bride &amp; groom, with two cats. \n\nLooked great on the website I found it on, only issue was I needed the groom silhouette altered; it was a suit, my husband was going to be wearing a kilt. \n\nThe website said the seller can make adjustments so PM’d and she came back saying “no problem, here’s a suggested change.”\n\nThe pic she sent was of the bride wearing a short skirt, so assuming this was just a language barrier issue I replied “sorry, it’s the groom, not bride.” \n\nShe came back with another photo, it looked fine so told her I’d like to order it. She asked me to put it through her seller page which was on a certain well known website but to add the customisation requests again. So I did and got the confirmation email.\n\nA week later she came back asking if I had placed the order, I said yes, even added the specifications. She came back to say no apparently it was to be put through “well known website” but not as “fulfilled by website” because otherwise the standard template would be sent automatically. I stopped myself from asking “what’s the point in asking for specifications during the ordering process that I clearly remembered doing?” and emailed asking what to do to get the order placed again.\n\nShe cancelled the order and gave me step by step on how to order it. So I did....\n\nOvernight I get confirmation that the order has been placed and then get a separate email - this is from the seller thanking me for my order and as it was a custom made order, an additional charge was required, along with her payment details. It was basically going to cost me twice what I expected to pay for the order.\n\nI went through all of the emails with the seller and not ONCE was an extra charge mentioned. I read back on her terms and conditions, seller page and there was nothing there either. \n\nI’m now pissed - something so simple was taking over a week to organise. I sent a request to cancel the order and directly emailed her back saying I no longer wanted the order to be honoured, at no point was additional payment mentioned, etc.\n\nShe apologised, said the email was meant for another customer, and she had made my order already and would ship it out if I liked. I said no, I want my money back. It took a couple of weeks but I did eventually get my refund. She said she posted out my order anyway as an apology but I never got it. \n \n",

        "text": "So this happened a few weeks ago. Me, my mom and my stepdad had just spent a few days in Copenhagen doing a lot of fun stuff, and it was time to go home. (If you ever go, visit the Tivoli at night, it's so goddamn beautiful.) We got to the airport and everything went pretty smoothly, we handed in our luggage, got out boarding passes and headed for security. Now, when we were in Copenhagen it was hot as shit there, and the workers at the airport were probably hot to, which I guess is why they all seemed to be in a mood. \n\nNow, at this airport, before you could go in through security, you had to go in through a gate and scan your boarding pass. So we all got into line, I watched my mom scan hers, the arrow on the screen went green, and the gates opened. I watched the same thing happen to my stepdad, and then it was my turn. I scanned my boardingpass, watched the arrow go green-  but the doors didn't open.  I tried again, and again, and again, the arrow kept going green, but the doors didn't open. This is when I started panicking. My mom and stepdad, seeing that I was now close to tears, hinted to me over all the other people there to go over to the desk, where there was a lady who could probably help me. I walked over and explained to her that 'my boardingpass scans, and the arrow goes green, but the doors don't open.' She took my boarding pass and kept asking me if I'm sure I scanned it correctly, like I was some sort of idiot. (They must have thought we were because there was a lady on the other side of the gates holding  a boarding pass and pointing to the thing you scan while also practically yelling \"SCAN THIS. THIS PART!\") Now after trying to scan my boarding pass she eventually figured there had been a mistake while it got printed out and told me to go back to the airline desk and ask for a new one. Now the panic set in even more- where the fuck was the airline desk? \n\nAt this point, thank God, my stepdad walked over and was allowed to go through and help me find the airline desk. We headed  back to the lobby, and to my surprise the airline desk wasn't a desk of it's own belonging to the airline we traveled with, but where we'd handed in our luggage. Thank God my stepdad was there or I never would have figured it out. We talked to a man there and got new ones, before heading back up to the angry ladies. Luckily this time it scanned and we all got through, and I had to hug my mom for a while. But now we had to deal with another pissy lady. While my stepdad and I had been gone, she had noticed a lady standing in front of the lines leading into security. A family would walk up, she'd angrily demand to know 'how many are you!?', they'd tell her and she'd aggressively wave them in the direction of the family line. \n\nNow for some reason a little baggage trolley (tiny one, meant for a backpack or hand luggage) had somehow made it's way through the gates and a man had found it, happily placing his bags on it. Now this lady, instead of telling him 'sorry, you're gonna have to leave that here' went off on a rant to this man about how he couldn't have it, until he just walked away. \n\nWhile we stood collecting out thoughts, a couple walked up to this lady, who again angrily demanded to know how many they were. The man, taken aback said 'excuse me?' and holy shit this lady got angry. \"How. Many. Are. You?\" she now asked, in the most 'are you dumb' voice I've ever heard. The man and woman, now looking shocked, said they were two and got waved through. \n\nEventually we all got through security and went to find our gate, and after a slightly traumatic experience for me, and meeting three very angry ladies, made it home.

I need to start working here immediately. \n\nBased on her accent, I assume that English is not her first language, so I probably embarrassed her, and then said a bunch of crap at her that made no sense.

One young couple (30s?) own and run three different places; a restaurant in the middle of the busiest part of town, a cafe just out of town, and a second cafe further along the coast. They all make great food and coffee, so there is no denying that their 'system' works. He is a chef, she runs the 'business' side of things, they are always busy and full with both locals and tourists.\n\nOnly there is one tiny problem...\n\nThey HATE people!!\n\nI could name many situations where they have yelled and abused their customers for the tiniest things, yelled at each other, or at their staff. If you read any online reviews for their establishments the responses they give are so outright rude it's hilarious. I even choose to go to their cafes on public holidays because they still open but are understaffed and it is 100% guaranteed that if you are there long enough you will witness one of these very entertaining outbursts. \n\nSo one morning, we head into town to enjoy a delicious breakfast at their restaurant, and you would not believe what they had written on the 'specials' blackboard displayed out the front...\n\n'Restaurant for sale....

        "text": "I order vintage tin signs to sell in the lobby of my business. I buy about 50 at a time and it takes a few months to sell them. So not retiring off tin sign money any time soon. \n\nI get the signs off a popular wholesale website I’ll call Forty Thieves or FT for short. I’ve made about 3 orders previously. The signs cost me about 3-4 dollars after shipping. My most recent order was a whopping $170. /s\n\nThe signs arrived super quickly and I was psyched because I was down to one sign, aka perfect timing. The box was bigger than usual but I use whatever supplier is cheapest at the time because it’s all the same product...\n\nI open the box and instead of signs there are a box of cardboard ring (jewelry) holders. It doesn’t really matter if you can’t picture this because the only takeaway needed is that these were not tin signs and in no way related to tin signs or my business. \n\nI contact the seller through the FT chat, as is customary. They ask me for picture after picture. Bar codes, packing slips, etc. This is extremely frustrating because they message only once a day and the pictures are very clear. I’m on the west coast so it’s not really the time difference but just indifference. I explain to them it’s clearly not the product I ordered and the seller continued to talk to me like a robot once a day. Each message had quotation marks around it. Maybe because it was pasted from a translator but probably because they do this all the time. \n\nI went to open an official dispute through FT and they said you can’t open a dispute until 10 days after the seller has sent the products. So because the box came super fast as I mentioned I have no recourse for the next few days but to try and work with the seller still.\n\nThis is where it gets absurd. The seller finally admits there is a mistake on their part a day before I could open the dispute. Im guessing a dispute is a black mark on their relationship with FT. Instead of saying here is your money back like a normal company they explain I have two options. I can accept $30 and keep the item I have absolutely no use for or I can send the items back on my own dime (very expensive) but get a “full” refund...\n\nI write them back I will go with option 3 where I get a full refund and I dispose of their mistake at no cost to them. They tried to convince me to give the items away as gifts and accept a 17.5% refund. I finally open the dispute the first minute I’m allowed to, thinking this will light a fire for them. Nope. They offer me $60 now instead of $30 before. \n\nI responded something like “You will give me a refund. I will not negotiate.” That finally did it. That and the dispute. I would get my money back in 7 days. So about one month later I’m back to even.\n\nThe icing on the cake was a few days later the seller messaged me again in an attempt to shame me for opening a dispute and hurting their reputation. \n\nTL;DR Order something from China. Sent the wrong items. Tried to have me foot the bill then shamed me for opening a dispute. ",
