I was under the impression that corn came to Europe during the Columbian Exchange. Is Strong wrong? Did corn disappear and reemerge in Europe?",

Did my people plan where to go and knew their destination, or rather at some point on the way decided \"here is good\" and settled?\n2. If they did not know where they are going how did they deal with terrain obstacles (straits, mountains, larger rivers) they didn't expect?\n3. How did they transport their belongings? Did they take animals with them, e.g. sheep and cattle? What happened to things and people who did not migrate with the rest? How did they gather resources during the journey (food, clothing, tools...)?\n4. Did they travel as a large, cohesive mass of people or rather several smaller, independent groups? How many people actually migrated? I understand, that each case will be different, so I'd be glad to see some examples. \n5. How did the migrating people communicate with those they met along the way and in their destination? I believe the language barrier was a serious problem, particularly for the lower classes - kings or priests could have known Greek or Latin all around the Mediterranean, but what about contact between peasants?\n6. Were the migrations peaceful endeavors looking to coexist peacefully with the local people, or did they look more like invasions and conquests?\n\nAll in all this appears to me to be a very wide topic and very diverse between different times and particular cases.

But it cannot be denied that the Americans sent us materiel without which we could not have formed our reserves or continued the war. The Americans provided vital explosives and gunpowder. And how much steel! Could we really have set up the production of our tanks without American steel? And now they are saying that we had plenty of everything on our own.\"\n\nHowever, some historians say that lend lease was initially received in limited amounts, and all the decisive battles had already been won by the Soviets by the time the lend lease exports heavily ramped up in production in 1944, and that it was only a matter of time before a surrender would be forced, regardless if they received American help or not, and the impact was rhe duration of the war and deaths suffered.\n\nWhich view is correct?",

Maybe all the migrants back then mingled together and i'm a product of those people  \n\n\nAs a supplement to the test itself: I live in Liège (Belgium) which was a principality ruled over by the Holy Roman Germanic Empire, my name is fully french and after having asked my grand-parents about their grand parents (they were born back in 1850 maybe), they said they've always lived around this region so it's not recent immigration. Being almost half mediterranean is surprising to me considering the geographical location and the fact that it's not recent immigration.  \n\n\nMy personal interpretation is that it is linked to Charles V or Charles Quint in french since his empire perfectly matched with the colored areas on the test but it seems like it stretches too far back to be the explanation.  \n\n\nThank you for your help, here's the test ([https://imgur.com/a/lqXXjZy](https://imgur.com/a/lqXXjZy))",

I believe, based on the names, this occurred in France. Dean also mentions that the Church preached against inter-class marriage at the time. So would the father’s likely motives for forbidding marriage to a person of higher station be because it would be socially unacceptable to go against current church doctrine or are there other common motives I’m missing? Also, for what purpose did the Catholic Church teach against inter-class marriage? Thank you in my advance for any answers.

He argued that Homer's identity was ambiguous and he could rather be seen as person who compiled pre-existing epics and most poetry from that time is lost anyway so we can't be sure.\n\nNow, this question is really bothering me. Juvenal and Hesiod comes to my mind, but the argument that a lot of literary works from their time being lost applies to them also.\n\nIt may sound dumb or I may not have expressed it correctly, but that is pretty much my question.
