        "text": "Hello! I am currently an Offensive Security analyst (also known as Pentester, ethical hacker or red teamer). I specialize in Web and network penetration testing. \n\nMy job is mainly about finding security holes within my companie's software and exploiting them.\n\nI have got into this field autodidactically. I have been teaching and researching ethical hacking by myself for roughly 8 years prior to 2020 and have gotten enough skills to get into the field officially. Before this I was a welder who specialized in beer brewing equipement. The only official diploma I have is a GED!\n\nIf you have questions about my self-learning path, Cybersecurity or even about my transition from traditional labour into the tech industry, AmA! :)",

Does anyone in the group have any contacts in California in the veterans over there who may be able to assist as I'm now vision impaired but not completely blind. This treatment is approved in the USA and final trials are now completed here. works for most brain injuries and PTSD. When approved for use in OZ it will save the department millions. It will also save a lot of pain and misery. The treatment has been approved for autoimmune diseases on the PBS scheme here but around twenty thousand AUD in the USA. Currently it appears it will be two or three years for approval here but I can't stumble around in the dark for that long. Any overseas VA assistance will be appreciated.

Oh, and we are now working on using the DNA that animals shrug off and leave behind as they make their way through the environment in order to estimate populations.\n\nAll of what we discover in these 58 lakes (and their watersheds) in a remote part of Ontario up in Canada becomes data we are excited to share with the world, which then influences the polices that governments and industries across the globe implement to protect fresh water for future generations. \n\nWe (Sonya Havens, Chris Hay, Scott Higgins, Michael Paterson and Thomas Saleh) have learned so much over the last ten years, and now we want to share what we have learned with you.\n\nSo, ask us anything*\n\n*within reason, of course!\n\n**My Proof:** https://twitter.com/IISD_ELA/status/1618311471196418048",

        "text": "Hi Reddit! My name is Vivienne Chang and as of today I am a published author of picture book THIS IS NOT MY HOME! Seriously the book comes out in Barnes &amp; Noble, Amazon, [Target.com](http://target.com/), [Walmart.com](http://walmart.com/), and more importantly your independent bookstore!! I’m also a proud Taiwanese American and senior in college at Washington University in St. Louis (WashU) studying Economics &amp; Finance. My best friend Eugenia &amp; I met in WashU in 2019, wrote our book in October 2020, got an agent in December 2020, and signed our 2-book deal in a heated auction sold to Hachette in January 2021. We’re one of the first traditionally published GenZ book authors and we’re trying to change the game!\n\nProof 1: [https://twitter.com/viviennechxng/status/1617904973895045121](https://twitter.com/viviennechxng/status/1617904973895045121)\n\nProof 2: [https://www.lbyr.com/titles/vivienne-chang/this-is-not-my-home/9780316377102/](https://www.lbyr.com/titles/vivienne-chang/this-is-not-my-home/9780316377102/)\n\nProof 3: [https://www.vivienneandeugenia.com/](https://www.vivienneandeugenia.com/)\n\nTHIS IS NOT MY HOME is our love letter to Taiwan. How does a PLACE turn to a home. It’s a reverse immigration story about a Taiwanese American girl, Lily, whose mother breaks the news to her that they’re moving to Taiwan to help take care of her grandmother. At the end of the day, we want to teach kids everywhere what it means to be an emotionally intelligent and good human and Eugenia and I will continue to make books in that manner.\n\nWe’re happy to answer any questions about publishing, publishing as Gen Z, picture books, Taiwan, college, literally anything!!",

I’m Skrintch. Ukrainian artist who paint colorful pet portraits. Me and my 2y.o. daughter lоst our home near Kyiv when the wаr was started. We didn't have a car and were forced to walk. Three weeks we hid in bomb shelters because the Russian troops were advancing. I told about it in the Internet and caring people helped us find a person who will take us out by his car. Now we have temporary housing in another town. We paint and send colorful portraits to people who help Ukrainians from around the world. There is no work here but some commissions help us buy food and pay for housing. Art makes her happy and distracts from the constant howl of an air alarm siren when misiles and kamikaze drones fly over us. My daughter thinks we are just walking for a long time and keeps asking when we will be back home because she doesn't understand that we have nowhere else to return. ASK ME ANYTHING  \n\n\nHere is my instagram: [https://www.instagram.com/skrintch\\_artist/](https://www.instagram.com/skrintch_artist/)",

I help build a $24M in GMV (gross merchandise volume) marketplace with 1000+ vetted developers.\nWe’re a Ukrainian startup. I’m leading all the Lemon.io tech aspects, living and working from Ukraine. In 2022 we donated $500k to Ukrainian charity, including 182k to KOLO foundation, and I’m extremely proud of that.\nBesides work, I love to create and try out all kinds of things. Songwriting, chess, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu – sometimes people around me wonder if there’s anything I haven’t done yet. Having returned from my crazy [7-months trip around Asia (2017)](https://lemon.io/blog/how-i-ignored-every-rule-of-freelancing-and-became-the-cto-of-a-freelance-platform/) with nothing but a laptop and guitar with me, I felt like it was a story worth telling.\nI will be answering your questions here Today (in 5 minutes from this post) on January 23th, 14:05 am – 18:00pm EST.\nLet’s talk about startups, CTO’s mindsets, leading a company during wartime and more.\n\n**My Proof:** https://postimg.cc/CRq4sFZZ",
