        "text": "So this happened to friends of mine while I was at their place. We were 4 people, the couple that lives in the apartment, me and another friend. Everyone was hungry except for me and they decided to order food. (I joined in with a small order for minum order value reasons).\n\n\nThe couple had several coupons for online ordering (like JustEat for example, different company though). They decided to use two coupons to save a few bucks (which wasn't necessary since they had the money) and therefore place 2 seperate orders at the same restaurant. I casually advised against doing this since there *will* be confusion at the restaurant.\n\n\nFast forward to after the usual delivery time. The food was paid for, two seperate orders, paid online, coupons used, everything's good so far. \n\n\nSo the driver rings the bell, my buddy answers, driver hands him two pizzas. My buddy asks about the other 2 pizzas since they ordered 4 in total but with seperate orders. The driver didn't know anything except that he only had these two pizza for this address. Maybe there was another driver bringing the other order.\n\n\nSo my buddy assumes that everything's fine. The two pizzas were my buddy's and a small one for me, we offered pieces of pizza to the other 2 but they decided to wait for their own. We eat, we keep on waiting (we were watching something on TV I think). \n\n\nAnother 20 minutes pass which was unusual, it wouldn't normally take this long. So my buddy calls the restaurant.  They are and oldschool restaurant with no real customer-service intentions, anyone who's free picks up the phone and tries to communicate. The person said they delivered the order, two pizzas. My buddy tries to explain that there were two orders, the restaurant person said they'll check and call back.\n\n\nSo no one called back, naturally. After his girlfriend and the other friend were starving they called the restaurant again. And again. And again. Then they wrote an E-Mail to Paypal. And another one. And another one. They eventually got their money back but that evening they starved and had to order again or eat whatever was eatable in the kitchen.\n\n\nIt was funny to watch for me as someone who had nothing to do with this tbh. It wasn't my decision to place two seperate orders and I bet the restaurant thought that we made a faulty order and placed the correct one a few minutes later. Since that restaurant was very chaotic they didn't record the scrapping of the order and my buddy wasn't able to somehow prove they placed two orders.\n\n\nI guess it's not *that* funny, but still enjoyable since everyone screwed up.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Buddy placed order for 4 pizzas in 2 seperate orders to be able to use two coupons. One order (his gf's and her friend's pizza) never arrived.",

        "text": "Most of my posts are as a result of reading another post that triggers a memory in my old tired brain. This one's no exception. Also, it's a little long. Sorry in advance.  \n\nMaybe 5 years ago, our old cable box was packing it in and we decided to get a PVR to replace it. At that time, the cable company had two options - either rent one indefinitely for $10/month, or rent-to-own over three years for a couple bucks more, no interest. We decided to go with rent-to-own, and the only payment option available was to give them a credit card that they could charge the monthly bill to. (Our regular cable bill was just the usual monthly paper statement which we paid via online banking.)  \n\nAfter about 8 months, I got a call from the credit card co. about some suspicious charges on the other side of the continent. Sure enough, my number had been skimmed. They were great about reversing the bad charges and issued me a new card.   \n\nNow comes the cable co. I called their billing line and explained what happened and that I wanted to give them the new card number to bill for the PVR. The rep that I talked to said it looked like this month's payment was already processed, so it would be too late to change it. However, she said it was no problem. She'd just put a note on our account with all the details. The payment would come back refused, and whoever reviewed it would see the note and resubmit the payment on the new card. I watched the card statement, and it appeared that was exactly what happened. The $12.50-ish charge to cable co. showed up and all was good.  \n\nOr so I thought.  \n\nI'll admit, other than a quick glance at the balance, I don't pay much attention to CC statements. If it doesn't look like the balance is crazy, I pay it, and that's the end of it.  \n\nSo, another 8 or 9 months later, the cable box refuses to work. Everything is unsubscribed. I call the help line and am told they disabled the box because I hadn't paid for it in 7 or 8 months, and I owe them something around $100. I explained what had happened, but I didn't have any dates or the name of the original rep I'd talked with, so basically I assume they figured I was giving them a made up sob story. I gave them my updated CC info, authorized the charge to get the account up to date, and that was that.  \n\n...Or so I thought...  \n\nTwo months later, their collections dept. is calling. I'm still not paying for the PVR and now my whole account is flagged as a deadbeat customer (or whatever term they use). I explain what happened. I did have dates and a name for the 2nd call. But they're having none of it. I'm truly sick of this by now, so I tell them to just charge the complete balance for the PVR to my CC and close this rent-to-own BS, which they do. While they had me, they told me about this great deal where if I signed up for automatic payment of my regular cable bill, they'd give me like 5 or 10 bucks a month of for 6 months. Why not? Sign me up. It's all good.  \n\n...Or so I thought...  \n\nA year goes by and I notice that the monthly bill has gone up a few times, just a couple bucks here and there, but it's adding up. That's why I don't like automatic payment - it's too easy to ignore what's going on. I call and ask to be switched back to monthly billing. Guess what? There's a deadbeat flag on my account and the only way I can have service is if I use auto payment.   \n\nI really wish we had more competition up here in Canada...",

        "text": "My boyfriend and I took a trip to our local super-store (rhymes with Dalmart) to see a bicycle we found on sale on their website. We find the bike and notice it's the only bike without a price-tag. We wanted to be sure that it was the price we saw online so we went to find an employee. See a somewhat elderly gentleman who works there an walk up to him. I say hello and ask him if he could possibly do a price-check on a bike for us. He will be EE I will be me:\n\nMe- Excuse me can you please help us with a price check on a bike we saw?\n\nEE - I don't know anything about bikes.\n\nMe - Okay, well is there someone else could possibly help us then?\n\nEE - Just show me the bike. \n\nSo we walk over to the bike and he starts looking for the price-tag. He realizes there isn't one on there. \n\nEE - There isn't a price-tage.\n \nMe - Yeah, that's why we asked if you could possibly do a price check for us. \n\nEE- I don't know anything about the bikes. \n\nAt this point I am annoyed. \n\nMe - Well can you possibly get someone who knows something about the bikes and can help us??\n\nEE- Wow there is no need to get rude! They don't pay me enough to deal with this shit! \n\nMy boyfriend and I are pissed at this point. I didn't yell, yes I snapped a bit and had a little gay sass, but did not raise my voice and this guy is acting like I asked him to do the most inconvenient task. He finally decides to get on his radio and ask for assistance. A manager replies and says \"I don't really have time but I'll be over there shortly\".....\n\nSo we wait and the entire time we are waiting the employee is going on and on about how he \"doesn't get paid enough for this and he's sick of dealing with rude people\"...um maybe get the fuck out of retail if doing a simple price check is too much for you. Finally after 15 minutes (yes, 15 minutes) the manager gets over there, doesn't say a word, checks the price (wasn't on sale) and both employees walk away. \n\nFuck you guys! That's what I get for going to Dalmart. ",

It came up in conversation recently, though and now I have a story to share with you!\n\nA group I was staying with for an event ordered two pizzas to be delivered from [popular pizza chain]. We called, we ordered, all was well. So we thought.\n\n45 minutes later and we have no pizza. So we call, they apologize and say they're swamped, it'll be there soon. Fine, things happen. \n\nAn additional 45 minutes later, we finally get our pizza. Except, wait... that's not our pizza. That's one pizza and an order of wings. Where's our food?\n\nCome to find out, the delivery driver GAVE OUR FOOD TO SOMEONE ELSE (and those jerks just took it, knowing it wasn't theirs, so don't think I let them off the hook).\n\nIt's now been nearly two hours, and we're starving and somewhat frustrated. So someone calls the place again.\n\nAfter waiting some more (I'm not sure exactly how much time passed) we still have no pizza. So one more call gets made. Unfortunately, I didn't hear the person on our end, so I'm not sure how the miscommunication occurred (my guess is they wanted to make sure nothing funny had happened with payment because someone else had our order), but the pizza place tells us they thought we wanted to cancel our order, when in reality we just wanted to receive the actual food we ordered. \n\nI think the entire ordeal last somewhere around three hours, just to get two pizzas. This happened in a different state than the one I live in, and I'm still afraid to order from that chain ever again.\n",

        "text": "A few weeks ago, I decided to hit up a bar in my neighbourhood. I don't go out much, and I'm a person who tends to find a favourite spot and stick with it. This place is six blocks from my house (walking distance), so I decided to give it a go. The place is a bit more rowdy and crowded than I typically would go for but I figured it was worth a shot. \n\nNow, I'm a person who is very stuck in my ways. I like one specific brand of beer, and one specific brand of bourbon. That's it. I don't stray.\n\nSo when I got there, I ordered my beer. All was well. I checked out the menu, and ordered some soft tacos. The menu was a bit fancier than I'm accustomed to for bar food, but they had a few good drunk-food options.\n\nOnce I had finished my beer and my meal, I started checking out the wall of bottles - and my heart sank a little. So far, I'd been having such a good experience. But they did not appear to have my brand of bourbon. In fact, I couldn't find any bourbon at all. The bartender came over to see if I wanted something else, and I asked if she had my brand, or any other brand of bourbon. She searched for almost ten minutes and came up dry.\n\nJudging from the fact that a couple of the other girls had been helping her with the till, and showing her how to mix certain drinks; and from how nervous she seemed, I figured she may be somewhat new. She was getting super stressed by not being able to find anything for me, so I called it off and just got another beer.\n\nFast forward to last night. I figured I could live without the bourbon, I wanted more of those tacos. So I went back. As I sat down in the same spot at the bar where I had been the last time, I looked up at the wall - and there on the shelf, right in front of me, was a bottle of my bourbon. As I'm waiting for the bartender to come around and take my order, a guy walks by, stops, and says, \"Hey, you're the (brand) lady, right? We brought that bottle in for you, you better drink it!\", laughs, and walks off.\n\nI left a very good review on Facebook later that evening. Two people liked it - a girl I recognized as my bartender from the first time, and the owner of the bar - the guy who walked by and recognized me. Turns out the bartender I had previously actually brought it up to the owner and he ordered a bottle specifically because I requested it, even though I wasn't a regular yet. That is some excellent customer service. I will definitely be making that my regular spot. ",

        "text": "So last night I attended my really good friend's birthday party. It was at 6:30 and I got off work at 5, so I had plenty of time to get home, change, and get to the restaurant. I'm really weird about time and never want to be late to anything, but I showed up around 6:45 to give other people a chance to get to the restaurant before I did. Well, turns out I was the first to arrive.\n\nSo I get out of my car, walk in the restaurant, approach the hostess, assuming reservations were in place, and explain I'm here for my friend's (we'll call her Anna) birthday party. I get looked at like I'm crazy after the hostess takes a quick glance at a computer screen, and she informs me that nobody named Anna has made reservations for tonight. After a little back and forth, it's clear we're not making any progress, so I decide to call my friend and ask what's up.\n\nTurns out she and a few others got held up at work, but were on their way-and yes, she was supposed to have a reservation in place (there were about 13 people in our party). As I'm having this conversation, a few other girls arrive and I explain what's going on, even offering my phone to the hostess so Anna could talk to her.\n\nThe hostess refuses to talk on my phone because it's 'against policy for an employee to be on the phone during shift,' and we try our best to make do of the situation-we forget about the reservation and ask if we could somehow pull together a table for our party (keep in mind this restaurant is basically half-empty, so it seemed reasonable), but she claims they're completely booked and don't have any openings. We ask about the dozen empty tables and she says they're all reserved.\n\nIt gets to the point where she's so fed up with us that she basically KICKS US OUT for 'creating a disturbance.' We didn't even put up a fight and ended up taking our party next door, where (even without a reservation) we were catered to and had a wonderful evening.\n\nI fully plan to call this restaurant tomorrow and speak to the manager.",

        "text": "Hello, everyone. I have a story to tell. It's kinda cheesy, but bear with me. \n\nSo. A bit of context. There is a small pizza place near my house. Not gonna name names, but it's a pretty well known chain. Now, my family has gone to that same place every now and again for several years. It's usually the same thing-one large cheese, extra cheese. Ordering it with extra cheese ensures that the pizza is fresh and hot (similar to ordering fries without salt), and the cheese nice and melty. VERY IMPORTANT-they do not charge extra for the cheese. They never have.\n\nHowever, every now and again, there will be a new cashier who doesn't realize this. They'll try and charge extra for the cheese. Usually, they'll concede if you say otherwise, but once or twice a manager has been involved. VERY IMPORTANT: managers *always* say there is no extra cost for cheese. They correct the new employees, and thus we receive a cheesy pizza at a decent price.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that my mother is always the one to contest the cheese prices. I myself, having read many a tale of angry customers demanding lower prices, do not have the heart to ever argue. Plus, there is the nagging fear that they've finally changed their cheese policies (policheese, if you will). As such, I leave in shame, paying extra for pizza.\n\nSo, yesterday. I went into the pizza joint, and ordered the cheesy disc of deliciousness. I'm fairly certain the cashier was new.\n\nC: \"That'll be [a dollar or so over the usual price].\n\nOh, shoot. The cheese price. At this moment, I am torn. Do I bow my head in shame and pay more for the pizza, like usual? Do I cancel the extra cheese? Or do I argue?\n\nFor once, dear readers, I decided to have a spine.\n\nMe: \"Did you say [the price]?\"\n\nThe cashier nods. \n\nMe: \"I'm sorry, but you don't charge extra for extra cheese.\"\n\nC: \"Yes we do.\"\n\nAt this point, another person has entered the pizza place. A line will form any second. My newfound spine is cracking. \n\nMe: \"I'm sorry, but I know you don't charge extra. You haven't before.\"\n\nThere's a brief, INCREDIBLY uncomfortable pause.\n\nC: \"Ma'am, we do.\"\n\nAaaand I broke. I called off the extra cheese (leaving my pizza with only a thin, leathery layer) and-forgive me-apologized profusely. After all, maybe they'd finally changed their policies. Maybe I was in the wrong. Maybe I was the bad customer. Maybe later, this cashier would boot up Reddit, and write a tale of the crazed patron demanding lower cheese prices. \n\nHowever, what the chaser said next...\n\nC: \"Sometimes, new cashiers don't charge because they don't know, but we're supposed to.\"\n\nIt may have been a pizza joint, dear readers, but there was something fishy. Like I said, managers have confirmed the cheese does not cost extra. More than once. Which meant either a) this cashier was new, but didn't want to sound new; or b) was trying to gyp me out of my extra cheese. \n\nIf I were a stronger redditor, I would have asked for a manager. I KNEW the extra cheese didn't cost extra. \n\nBut alas, I am not a stronger redditor. As such, I left the pizza join with my head hung low and my pizza lukewarm and light on cheese. \n\nAnd that is my tale. I know it's not very entertaining, but here it is. Thank you for reading, and goodbye. ",

It does not matter how much poison you spray.  They are still there.  It just keeps them somewhat at bay.\n\nBut this little bastard was on my nightstand.  While the lights were on.\n\nFor those of you not familiar with German cockroaches, they like the dark.  They only come out in the light when the infestation is really, really bad.\n\nI've lived away from Texas for 39 years.  In places that don't have German cockroaches.  It's been heaven in that regard.\n\nSo this little fucker really freaked me out.  I quelled my disgust and went about the business of eating my dinner.\n\nWhen I finished, I bagged up the garbage and took it to the lobby trashcan.  No reason to give those little assholes any more reason to show themselves in my room.\n\nI stopped by the front desk to (quietly) let the FDA know that a roach showed up while the lights were on.  Now, maybe she's not as well-versed in roach behavior as I am.  It's possible. She's young.\n\nBut her excuse for the roach was that I didn't want any scent sprayed in my room and that she'd let housekeeping know.\n\nReally?  REALLY???????  It's not housekeepings fault.  The roach didn't come out because I didn't want Febreze sprayed in my room.\n\nDoes she really think I believe housekeeping sprays for roaches every single time they clean the room?  If that's how they deal with roaches, no fucking wonder they have enough to come out while it's light.\n\nI told her housekeeping did a great job on my room and I just wanted her to know so she could have management call the exterminator after I leave.  I made sure to tell her I didn't want poison sprayed in my room while I'm here.\n\nI plan on going out tomorrow and getting some boric acid powder and treating the room myself.  That shit's magic.\n\nAlso, I plan on unpacking in my driveway when I get home.  Or maybe I'll just put my suitcase in the freezer for a day.\n\nYou know what?  I don't really need that suitcase or those clothes.  I'll just buy new stuff. /s",

Everyone has this happen.\n\nI occasionally get bored enough to go out of my way to remove my email address from these accounts and lists by calling the company in question (obviously not by clicking anything in the emails! Don't do this!)\n\nSo far, I've learned that a very well-known gaming console's account support doesn't give a crap about fraudulent accounts, which means that if I ever do want to set up an account with them I can't use my own email address or I risk possibly being accused of taking over someone else's account, I guess (if you work for that sort of company and can do something about that, maybe, PM me and I'll tell you if you're hot or cold - I have a long-ignored ticket number and a bone to pick).\n\nI just got off the phone with the account support line for a formerly-large ISP.

I explained the situation and why i was concerned, and told him that I don't particularly want to be a party to any sort of fraud whether accidental or intentional, and the poor guy's nervous chuckle, admission of \"well, this is new\" and putting me on hold made me cringe a bit. I've been there before, on the other side of that phone. But when he came back, he explained that I had nothing to worry about. He told me that there isn't a worst-case-scenario for me. He told me that, at worst, someone probably mistyped something and it isn't as though I've been hacked. \n\nOf course not. I explained to him that I didn't particularly want to be in a very good position to take over someone else's account. He didn't seem bothered by the prospect and, indeed, told me not to worry about it and ended the call.\n\nSo, if I assume that someone did just mistype their recovery email address and didn't realize it and change it later, then there is some poor sap out there that [intentionally-redacted] doesn't give a flying crap about. Of course, that also means that, should this have been the far more likely scenario of someone setting up a free account for use in spamming large numbers of other people and for whatever reason request a password reset, I could then take control of that account should I want to and still this company wouldn't really care. \n\nSecurity? \n\nNah. We might've been mighty once, but there's a reason we aren't anymore. Nice rep, baffling situation.",

        "text": "I'm back again! Posted like three days in a row, clearly life is going well. So, during Hurricane Irma, a ton of rain was forced into my cheap Kia, and it now smells gross. I stuck in a damp-rid and called a local auto parts store, thinking I should probably change my air filters just in case they are also full of water and dampness. (spoiler: they were)\n\n\n\nSo I call, and a not so enthusiastic person answers. We'll call her NE (not enthusiastic).\n\nNE: Hello, Auto parts store, how can I help you?\n\nMe: I need to order a cabin air filter and engine air filter for a *year* Kia *model*\n\nNE: Uh, don't you have bigger things to worry about after this storm?\n\nME: Um, water got into my car and I want to make it not smell. I'd say that's important. My house is fine, so this is at the top of my list. (Almost wanted to say \"uh, is that your business?)\n\nNE: Well my car is totaled and my house is ruined, too. And I have a baby.\n\nMe: Okay, I'm sorry to hear that. I know I was pretty lucky. Hope everything gets better for you, so do you have any air filters?\n\nNE: Yeah, we can order them. They'll be here around 1.\n\nMe: Great, I'll see you then.\n\n\nBut it doesn't end there. I go to pick them up, turns out she's the manager and had to help the guy ringing me up do that, that's fine. I then ask, because I'm a 20 year old girl and have no idea how cars work and my mechanic is closed, if someone can point me in the general direction of how to change the filter. It's fine if they can't, I'll google it, but having a person is kinda nice and they aren't busy at all. This chain has always been willing to help me before. The guy at the desk is new and flat out says he has no idea how to do it, that's fine. NE says she will take a look.\n\n\n\nI lead her out to the car, open the hood, etc. And she completely takes over, which is not a problem, but she didn't really have to. And then she starts complaining.\n\nNE: You know, I shouldn't be doing this, I'm the manager. I'm not supposed to leave the store.\n\nMe: You don't have to, it's ok. I can figure it out.\n\nNE: Ugh, no, it's fine. I just shouldn't be doing it. You know, in case someone needs me.\n\nMe: ....\n\nNE: Ok there it's done. You're lucky you even have a car, you know.\n\nMe: Yup, I am. Hope your day gets better.\n\nAnd she leaves to go back inside. \n\n\nI get that a lot of people lost a lot due to the storm, and I feel for them and usually even ask people I meet in public how they're doing, but I don't really need some lady guilt tripping me for not losing everything.

        "text": "So this occurred a few weeks back. My girlfriend was away filming for the day and she'd taken my phone as hers didn't work. This is relevant. \n\nI arrived home after work - starving. I had completely forgotten that my girlfriend had my phone at this point. I decided to order Pizza online via JustEat. (I should be able to give their name as they are not the company the food comes from - they are just a third party ordering service.) There was a new place nearby and I figured why not try them out.\n\nI placed the order and waited, and waited... and waited. \n\nAfter an hour I went to call them and realized I didn't have my phone. I grabbed the house phone and called them up. I was told that the driver was at my house but I wasn't answering the door. I informed the guy on the phone that there was nobody at my door and that I'd run down the road to see if he was perhaps at the wrong house but on the same street. The guy on the phone told me he'd get the driver to wait. \n\nAs I was going up the road I spotted a silver car and a dude inside it on the phone. I tried to wave him down but he pulled off fairly aggressively and sped away. \n\nI ran back home, called the pizza place again and asked if their driver was in a silver car. They told me he was and that he'd gotten fed up waiting for me. They told me I could come and get the food now as I'd inconvenienced them. I explained that I'd completely forgotten that I'd left my phone with my girlfriend and apologized but I had no way of getting to them for the food. If the guy could drive back quickly I'd take the pizza off him. He couldn't be more than 5 minutes away at this point. The guy on the phone said he'd get the driver to come back. So I waited on the road. 15 minutes go by - no driver appears. \n\nI went home again and called them for the 3rd time. The same guy picked up and told me that the driver wanted to speak to me. He told me that he'd been 'f*cking waiting for me for half an hour and I could come and get the food if I f*cking wanted' because he didn't 'give a sh*t'. I told him that he'd been at the wrong house as nobody had knocked on my door - I was told again that he 'didn't give a sh*t'.\n\nI am totally aware that I messed up by not having the phone but I did all I could at this point to try and make up for it. I asked if they could send the food out again and I'd stand at the entrance to the estate so that the driver couldn't miss me. They refused. \n\nI was getting annoyed at this point so I asked for a refund if they wouldn't deliver the food to me. They refused this also. Saying that the situation was entirely my fault. I tried arguing that we were both to blame as I didn't have my phone but they'd gotten my address wrong. I asked them what address they'd taken down and the guy told me number 15 whatever avenue, whereas I am number 19 whatever avenue. \n\nAt this point the guy on the phone realized that they had in fact messed up as well. He now decided they would send my food to me - with the same driver who'd just cursed at me over the phone. I was now well past the point of wanting to receive anything but my money back. They refused and said they'd send my food - I told them not to and hung up.\n\nThey then began to call my house phone several times which I ignored. \n\nIt was now over two hours since I'd originally ordered the food. I contacted JustEat and explained the entire situation to them - both my negligence for not having a phone and the pizza places responses to the situation. They refunded me on the spot.\n\nI get that I messed up but I think the fact that a representative of this pizza place decided the right thing to do was get on the phone and swear at a customer was insane.",

        "text": "So, a couple of weeks ago, my fiancé had a friend in town to help him do some work on a project. Friend was here over the weekend, and the guys really needed to get shit done by Sunday afternoon because the project needed to be complete for the following week. So, they put a really good dent in things on Saturday, and on Sunday morning, they decide to grab some breakfast before getting back at it. I decide to come along, because breakfast is awesome and food made by someone else is always great.\n\nSo, we roll up to this little diner around the corner from our house. Fiancé and I have been going to this joint for years and years. Food is super basic but filling and cheap and usually pretty quick, so we figure it's perfect. We're seated at about 8:15, and around 8:20, our server finally comes over and gets a drink order. We all put in for coffee and waters. \n\nAbout another five or so minutes pass before she returns with our drinks. At this point, we're ready to order -- I order a waffle, the guys get breakfast platters, all is well with the world.\n\nTen or so minutes go by. Our server returns with a phone clasped to her ear. She moves the mouthpiece away long enough to tell me, \"We're out of waffles.\" I go, \"Oh, um --\" and then she walks away. When she returns another ten minutes or so later, now off the phone, she asks what I want instead of the waffle. I tell her pancakes, but at this point we're all looking at the clock and wondering when the hell we're going to get out of here, because my non-waffle order could have easily been taken when she came over initially if she hadn't been on the fucking phone.\n\nMore time passes. Our coffees slowly diminish. But hark! Our food finally arrives! Or at least everything but my pancakes, because fucking of course! Server reaches across me to put my fiancé's food in front of him -- and subsequently knocks my full water glass into my lap.\n\n\"Aw, damn it. Why'd you have it there? Ugh, I didn't get enough sleep last night -- I wish you hadn't put your water there!\"\n\nYep. No apology, but instead I get blamed for where my water glass was on the table. (And for the record, it wasn't at the edge of the table or anything like that. There was quite a bit of water on the table as well as on me.)\n\nMy pancakes didn't come out for another almost fifteen minutes, and I asked for a box right away we could get out of there. It was still close to 10 when we left. Nothing was comped (to be fair, we didn't ask), and while I did get an apology from the *other* server working there, nothing was said to me about the water or my pancakes or any of that.\n\nWe haven't been back since, even though the place is literally walking distance from our house.

I've been without power for about 36 hrs (and stuck inside for even longer) and the estimates for it being turned back on aren't till later this week.  \n  \nLocal businesses are just starting to open up here and there. All the restaurants that have opened have hour long lines (even fast food) because everybody has been cooped up in their dark houses eating chips and sweating and wants to get outside.   \n  \nThis morning I got up super early to hunt down some gas. I got really lucky and found some! And even better, across the street was a golden arches fast food joint that was open. Nothing sounds better then hot food when you haven't had it in a couple days. There was a super long line for the drive thru but plenty of parking for inside, so I parked and walked up to the doors only to see huge hand made signs that said \"lobby closed\" \"drive thru only\". No problem. I understand why they might need to operate this way for now. So I get back in my car and get in the drive thru line which is now wrapped around the building completely. It was even blocking the people leaving the drive thru which slowed the line down a bit as people had to reverse to let them out. After I got in the line it even extended out into the road!  \n  \nI had absolutely no problem waiting in this line. It would be worth it. After 45 mins, I finally pull up and I'm ready to place my order.   \n  \nCashier guy \"hi welcome to golden arches, we will only be accepting cash this morning\". \n  \nMe \"are you FUCKING SERIOUS\" (I lost it guys, I'm sorry). \n  \nCashier guy \"yes, I'm sorry ma'am but there is nothing we can do but take cash\"  \n  \nMe \"I understand that, but why haven't you written a sign somewhere to let people know?\"  \n  \nCashier guy \"we're unable to do that at this time, again I'm sorry\"  \n  \nMe \"you can cover your doors and windows with signs saying lobby closed but you can't write a sign saying cash only??????\"  \n  \nAnd yes, I'm ashamed to admit that I peeled out and sped out of there. I was fuming though! All my dreams of hot hash browns had been dashed. I realize I acted like a total dick in this scenario, and this should probably teach me to carry cash.... but how hard is it to put up a sign?  \n  \nEdit: I forgot to add that there was two girls in the lobby area cleaning with mops and wipes and stuff, talking and laughing. So it's not like they didn't have an employee available to make a sign. ",

        "text": "Background: My Dad and I go golfing once or twice a month during the summer and we always return to the same golf course because we love it so much. In the past, the staff has treated us with respect and the overall customer service was great. We booked a tee time to go golfing yesterday, and we were treated like scum by the new \"golf manager\" for not following the dress code. I fully understand Golf Etiquette as I wear a tucked in polo with golf shorts &amp; shoes when I go golfing. My Dad, on the other hand did not have a collar on his shirt yesterday, but he was wearing a plain dry-fit T-shirt tucked into golf short (with a belt) and golf shoes. This is my Dad's usual outfit when we go golfing, and we have never had troubles in the past with him wearing a non-collared shirt (he's stubborn I know).\n\nAnyway, we booked a tee time to go golfing yesterday and when we arrived at the golf course I dropped my Dad off at the club house to pay as I went to the parking lot to unload our clubs. My Dad paid for our round of golf and we grabbed a cart to begin our round. We then drove up to the 1st hole, there was a group of 4 people in front of us that just tee'd off so we had to wait a minute before we started. Usually on the first hole there is an employee that checks your receipt and writes down your name and cart number for liability purposes, but for some reason this employee was not present when we were there.\n\nWhile we were waiting for the group in front of us to tee off, we hear somebody behind us yelling \"Hey guys!\". My Dad and I turn around to see an employee walking towards us trying to get our attention (we will refer to him as shithead for the rest of the story). I recognized shithead from a previous employer I used to work for (he used to be a service advisor at a car dealership that I worked for/My Dad takes his car in to get serviced at said car dealership) so turns out my Dad and I know shithead. Before we can get a word out, shithead proceeds by yelling \"Dress Code!\" at us. My Dad and I look at each other in confusion, but I realize that my Dad does not have a collared shirt on. We then apologize for this mistake and try to explain how the employee at cash did not stop us when we paid for our round, but shithead is having none of it and continues to say, \"I never let ANYBODY through who is not following proper golf etiquette\". We were quite taken back by this, as we have never had troubles with wearing a plain t-shirt before. Also we have never seen shithead work here before (turns out he is the new golf manager and started a month ago).\n\nInstead of giving us a friendly reminder to wear a collared shirt next time we come golfing at the establishment, shithead gives us an ultimatum, \"You either need to come inside and buy a golf polo or take your business elsewhere\". I am usually not one to get angry, but I was furious that shithead knew the both of us and was basically trying to up-sell a $30 polo on top of our round of golf. I was fuming and told him that we were going to take our business elsewhere after he refunds us for the round of golf. Shithead rolls his eyes and tells us to go to the club house to get a refund. Once in the club house, shithead continues to badger us about the polo, as he says \"I can sell you this polo if you want to golf today\". I was sick and tired of him, so as much as it pained me to keep my mouth shut I told him to \"shut the fuck up and give us our refund\". My Dad told me to go wait outside and cool down, so I did. But doesn't shithead follow me outside to give me a stare down while I'm loading our clubs back into the car. I was officially out of fucks to give so I cursed at him some more (woops). \n\nI'm still trying to wrap my head around why he gave us such a hard time for wearing a non-collared shirt. This whole fiasco could have been avoided by simply reminding us of the golf etiquette for the next time we retuned. We are currently trying to get a hold of the owner to complain about shithead, as I think he went overboard with the policy. I understand that he was trying to do his job and enforce golf etiquette on the course, but he could have been more lenient &amp; friendly about it. I don't think we will be returning to this golf course again, this whole thing left a bad taste in our mouths.\n\nTLDR: My Dad was not wearing a collared shirt at a golf course and we got told to either buy a polo or take our business elsewhere.\n",

        "text": "When I was in grad school my friend and I moved into an apartment a few miles from campus. We both had TVs that we wanted to put in our rooms; the problem was that only one bedroom had a cable jack. We asked management if we'd be allowed to install another one and they said it was no problem and people did it all the time.\n\nSo we call the cable company, explain what we want done, and set up an appointment for them to come out. When the guy gets here he hooks up the cable in the room with the existing cable jack, and sets up our wi-fi and prepares to leave. I ask him why he didn't install a cable jack in the second room. He looks extremely confused and said \"why would I do that?\" I said because that's part of what this appointment was for. He tells me he isn't normally allowed to do that in apartments and I'd have to ask management if that was allowed. I explained that they already gave me permission, and he says that even so, he doesn't have the right equipment for that and we'll have to set up a second appointment.\n\nNot wanting there to be any confusion for the next time, I call customer service and make another appointment but I also ask them to email me a description of what the appointment is for. I also make sure to get written permission from the landlords to put a cable jack in the wall.  So I'm fairly certain everything is all set.\n\nThe day of the second appointment arrives. The guy (different guy) comes in, walks into my bedroom and goes \"oh whoops, wrong room, there is there no cable jack in here.\" I told him he's supposed to install it which is why he is here. He says no, he isn't usually allowed to do that in apartments and I must be mistaken. I show him the written permission from the landlords as well as the email confirmation from the cable company that says exactly what this appointment is for. He says that nobody told him that, and so he doesn't have the right equipment and we will have to make another appointment. Obviously I'm pissed, but I'm not sure what else I can do besides call the company again.\n\nSo I call them to complain about the absurd lack of communication between customer service and the contractors they send out. The representative seems really understanding and apologetic but basically tells me they get complaints just like this all the time and they're \"working on it.\" I tell her if there is any confusion with the third appointment, I will be taking my business elsewhere. \n\nThe day of the third appointment arrives. Once again, I have an email confirmation saying the contractor is supposed to put a NEW cable jack in the wall. The guy gets here (again a different guy) and basically says the same thing as the second guy, that apartments normally don't allow that and he wasn't told about this and so doesn't have the right equipment. I tell him \"I have nothing to do the rest of the day. I will wait here while you go and get the equipment you need so you can do the job I asked for, and if you don't like that then you can take all the other stuff with you because we'll be using another cable company.\" He looks kinda pissed and gives me a kind of look like \"geez calm down woman,\" but he agrees to go and get the right equipment.\n\nHe gets back about 40 minutes later and the whole job was done within an hour. I thank him and he leaves. We didn't have any other issues after that, but my god I never expected something like this to be so difficult. I get that maybe installing new cable jacks isn't allowed in some apartments, but every landlord is different and the fact that I had written permission should count for something. \n\nFun fact: after all this happened, a cousin of mine was briefly employed at this company and left after not even a year because he said he couldn't work for a company that had such poor communication and treated customers so ridiculously.",

The manager offered to find us a table downstairs with more space, but as we'd already sat down and pulled a few tables together - and no one had reserved those tables - we politely asked if we could stay there rather than make everyone move.\n\nSo the manager said that was fine, but there would be a slight wait on food. I was expecting half an hour to 45 minutes, but I don't think it was even half an hour. It was good food, too.\n\nSo props to that pub for handling a sudden massive walk-in excellently, and to that kitchen for somehow getting our food out in a normal time.",

        "text": "This is an on-going issue. I am here to both vent and seek advice.\n\n\nSo, one of my professors recommended we get 2 textbooks to help us, not only with the class, but in the future. One was a [writing] book, to help with writing things like proposals and what-not. The other is an [engineering] book, to help with, I dont recall. But it came highly recommended. Upon viewing the prices for both on [online river], they both were reasonably priced, and my mom said go ahead and order. In addition to a book for another class, the [writing] book arrived just fine. Mind, all three books came from 3rd-party. I had been using [online river] for years, no issues. The long-awaited [engineering] book arrives, I open it, and I am greeted by [history book]. I check the shipping label, my roommate and I share the same first name, and it was indeed shipped to me. I check the package slip, it very clearly says [engineering] book on it. Not to mention, [history] book is paperback, while the slip said [engineering] book was meant to be hardcover. I email [online river] and 3rd party vendor, because I wasn't 100% about what I was supposed to do. [river] says to let them know if vendor doesn't fix the issue, increasing my worries.\n\n\nI received an email from vendor relatively quickly; however, in my initial email, I made it very clear what my issue was, and that I didn't want a refund. I wanted the book I ordered. The way all emails have been worded thus far makes me feel like they didn't even look at what my issue is. This has been ongoing for a week now, and the email I received today goes:\n\n\"Please give me 1-2 business days to figure out the problem. Would you like us to send the second book if available?\"\n\nWTF!!! YOU HAVE HAD WELL OVER A WEEK TO FIGURE OUT THE ISSUE!!! I sent pictures, like they asked me to. I sent a picture of the cover of the book I received, the package slip, and the ISBN label. Now it sounds like they might not even have the book I ordered to begin with. Of course, that's assuming the 'second book' is [engineering] book.\n\n\nThe previous email asked me if I wanted a partial refund or a full refund. (Partial would be if I kept the [history] book, full would be if I returned it. Given some of the stories I've read here, I have a sinking suspicion the return would be at my expense. Should I just take the refund and forget about getting [engineering] book? Am I expecting too much for the vendor to honor my order?\n\nI understand that some people will try to cheat and lie in order to get free stuff. At the beginning, I just wanted to exchange [history] book, and get [engineering] book. I came in with the understanding that mistakes happen, and the person I was dealing with was probably not responsible. At this point, however, I am getting angry. I feel like I am not being heard, and they are not taking the necessary steps to fix THEIR mistake. The apologies I have received feel hollow, like they are required to tell me that, but they don't mean it. I don't recall seeing a number to call, or I would have handled it that way, because clearly email exchanges aren't working. This whole thing is just pissing me off, and adding stress I really do not need. \n\nMy apologies for the length, and I hope you all have a good day.",

        "text": "Yesterday several of my coworkers and I went out to a local bar and grill place to celebrate a coworker's birthday. I'm new to this job but evidently many of my coworkers have been coming here for years and know a lot of the staff, and one even knows the owner and has his number. We knew we were going to have about 10 people in total so we made a reservation just to be safe earlier in the week for 3:30 (we are all teachers so school let out at 3 and we came straight there). Three of us got there right at 3:30, and the place was empty and there was nobody to seat us, so we went to a corner and pulled a couple tables together and waited for the others. This place is usually a seat yourself kind of place anyways unless it's busy, so it didn't really matter (they have a sign at the entrance that says \"if you do not see the hostess, you may seat yourself).\" \n\nAs the rest of our party is filing in, a waitress comes around and starts taking drink orders, greets us, etc. At 4 we ordered a bunch of appetizers to share and at 4:25 our food arrives. Just as we start passing plates around and distributing silverware, a girl comes up to us and says \"you all need to move to another table.\" We're a little confused and ask what she's talking about. She tells us a \"large party has made a reservation and requested this specific spot.\" We tell her that our group also had a reservation. She tells us that our group was meant to sit somewhere else and had no business just coming in and seating ourselves here. We told her when we got here, the place was basically empty and nobody was there to seat us, and there was nowhere in the restaurant where tables had been put together for us that would indicate our party was supposed to sit there. At this time, the place is slightly busier but not much. So we ask if we can move after we eat, since everything is already on the table, and since nobody said anything to us about this in the hour we'd been there. She tells us the other party is coming at 4:30 (it was then 4:28) and we need to move right now, and she points at a table clear across the restaurant. So we're pretty pissed but, not wanting to cause trouble, we grab everything and move. The girl did not offer to help us carry any plates or drinks and instead just walked away.\n\nOnce we're settled at the new table, we ask if we can talk to a manager because the whole thing was handled very rudely. We are told that the girl who told us to move actually is a manager, but there is another manager we may talk to. So we explain to her that we had been there for an hour where nobody told us we shouldn't sit there while we ordered food and drinks, and that the manager who told us to move was very accusatory and rude to us, when in fact we were just following the restaurant's policy of seating yourself when it isn't busy. If someone had said something to us earlier before all the food arrived, we would have had no problem moving. This manager does apologize to us but her tone was kind of sarcastic, and she kinda says \"well I wish I could do something.\" And walks away. We're still pretty pissed about how the whole thing is being  handled, but for the time being we are hungry so we eat our food and have a good time.\n\nWhile all this is happening, we can still see the table we moved from, and we glance at it occasionally to see who ended up sitting there. Keep in mind the reservation was supposedly for 4:30. At 5:00, nobody is at that table and we're wondering if we've been lied to. At 5:30, an hour late, a group of four teenage looking girls walk in, go up to the counter and say they have a reservation and they're sorry they're late and didn't call but they were out shopping and lost track of time (I was on the end of the table nearest to the counter and could hear), and are escorted to the table we left earlier. The tables were still pushed together. These girls legit look like they are 15, and I'm not even sure they're old enough to be in a bar like this. We thought maybe there were more people in their group coming, but no, it was just them. Later when I got up to use the bathroom I had to pass by their table to get there, and could hear one girl saying her Daddy wasn't going to like how much she spent at the mall on his credit card today, and the others start giggling. I shit you not this was their conversation.\n\nSo that was the reason we were asked to move- for four teenage girls because they wanted to sit in the large group tables by the windows, and who ended up being an hour late for their reservation because they were on a shopping spree. In what kind of world is this acceptable?! We're totally baffled at this point. My buddy who knows the owner, asked if the owner is here tonight. He's not, but the general manager of that location is now here and she asks to speak to him. He just tells her \"well my manager said she wasn't rude to you\" and does nothing. We were in no way trying to get them to give us anything for free,  but we just wanted someone in authorityto apologize to us, and mean it, for the inconvenience we were caused on the restaurant's behalf. But apparently that wasn't happening. My buddy told the manager that most of our group had been coming here for years and never had any trouble, and that after tonight they would no longer be getting our business. The manager just says \"well I'm sorry you feel that way\" and walks away. \n\nSo we pay our bill and leave around 6. The only person who actually apologized to us for real was our waitress, and she didn't even have anything to do with it. She said she felt bad that it was handled so wrongly and we shouldn't have been treated that way. We thanked her and reassured her that she did nothing wrong and was nothing but kind and gracious to us through the whole thing. ",

It's extremely hard to find a gas station with fuel, and if you do, it'll be gone within an hour. This makes it insanely difficult. \n\nSo I start of my Wednesday calling around to gas stations in my area, who sound irritated or some don't even answer at all. I work retail, I hate answering the same questions all day, too, but this is a little more important than usual, but I digress. \n\nI finally find a gas station that says \"The truck is on the way, it's on *local interstate* And should be here within the hour!\" Great! I hop in my car and plan to wait at the gas station until it arrives, get some ice cream while I wait, all that.\n\nSo I get there, on other car is waiting as well, and more begin to arrive. When I went in to get my ice cream the owner again states it's on it's way. Perfect!\n\nI take my ice cream outside and stand outside my car. I'm not trying to waste the gas I do have by running my air like all the other idiots, because I've been duped before in this gas shortage. I strike up a conversation with some other people, and then some even turn off their cars and come over and join the conversation. All in all about 5 or 6 people all chatting about the storm, like a community does.\n\nAnother customer walks up and says \"I just want you guys to know, this truck isn't anywhere close to being here, I just heard the owner on the phone with someone about it\" \n\nNot less than a second later the owner runs out to our little group, frantic. He stutters a bit about some sort of explanation, but it's really making it clear he never knew when the truck was going to get here and just wasted our time.\n\nAnd then his phone rings. He says \"ah, this is my distributor, I'll put it on speaker\" and so he does. Her name is C.\n\nC: \"DID YOU TELL CUSTOMERS THE TRUCK WAS GOING TO BE THERE SOON? I can't believe you, I never told you any sort of time frame for this exact reason! It won't be there for at least a few hours, and you'll be closed by then! Send them all home and apologize!\" \n\nHis face drops and he says goodbye to her and begins to explain and before he can I say \"Yeah, we all heard what she said. We get it. Don't bother.\" \n\nHe says he opens at 6 tomorrow, and he will have fuel at that point, so we all grumble and drive away. I did still go back to that station at 6, because no other stations could give me an exact time to be there. I did end up getting gas, but I was just very put off by how he handled this situation.",

I had my first experience of a downright rude employee at my local Sandwich-Way today and I thought I'd share it with you guys:\n\nFirst and foremost, I work in customer service too, so I understand that rudeness goes both ways, regardless of which side of the counter you're on. Iv'e had customers be incredibly rude to me in the past. For this reason, I try to go out of my way to be polite to people in the service industry. \n\nAnyway, I entered the Sandwich-Way and it was kinda busy. It was early afternoon, so I figured it was kind of a late lunch rush. Whatever. I just waited in line patiently like everyone else until it was my turn to order. I noticed one of the sandwich artists had a bit of an attitude with other customers as I was waiting in line. I could tell she was starting to get pissed.\n\nAnyway, it was my turn to order. I will refer to this woman as RSA (rude sandwich artist for the sake of the story):\n\nMe: \"Hi. May I have a Vegetarian Delight on sourdough bread please?\"\n\nRSA: \"UMM we only have these breads available!\" *Points aggressively to sign that listed available breads*\n\nFair enough. I just didn't notice the small sign. Calm the hell down.\n\nMe: \"Okay. Can I have that on Italian instead?\" \n\nRSA: \"Yeah. What kind of cheese?\"\n\nMe: \"No cheese.\"\n\nRSA: \"Umm, NO cheese?\"  \n\nYes. No cheese. What part of that don't you understand? Why are you being so rude? Keep in mind, it's busy, but not crazy busy. She had no excuse to act like this.\n\nSo after she put the veggies on my sub she asked what kind of condiments I wanted as usual. I just wanted to get the hell out of there.\n\n RSA was triggering my anxiety with her unnecessary rudeness. I get that this industry is stressful, but come on. You don't need to take it out on polite, well mannered customers. \n\nMe: \"May I have some sweet onion sauce, please?\"\n\nRSA: *squeezes the remains of the basically empty bottle  on sandwich* \"Is that enough?!\"\n\nMe: \"Yes.\" \n\nThere was no way in hell I was gonna ask her for more. I was done with her at this point. \n\nRSA: \"GOOD.\" \" Cuz we're out.\"\n\nI was honestly taken a-back. Really? This is not how you treat customers. I don't care if it's just Sandwich-Way. I would NEVER treat my customers with such rudeness at my job. Everybody else in line was looking at me like *are you gonna say something?* \n\nIt was very awkward. Luckily, the cashier who rang up my order was very polite. As I walked out with my sandwich, I thanked the cashier for his politeness:  \n\nMe: \"Thank you.\"  I said. \"At least SOMEBODY knows how to treat customers around here!\" \n\nI stormed out and my hands were shaking with anxiety. I'm usually a very mild-mannered person but this woman just pissed me off.\n\nI'm honestly thinking about complaining. What do you guys think? Am I over-reacting?",

I'm given\nwiggle room to use this card as i see fit but i must obtain receipts and also i can NOT give tips on the card. These i have to pay out of my own pocket. I don't have any issues\ndoing this at all. This tip thing will become important later on.\n\nNow we have what we call \"local accounts\". These are company's that have a credit account with us who fill up their fleets of cars, van's and trucks daily. Most of our \"locals\" spend\ntens if not hundreds of thousands a year with us so when one of the higher ups from these company's come in they are treated well.  Sorry i'm going on here but i'm getting to\nthe story..\n\nYesterday while i was on my own lunch i had walked up to the main street to grab some food. Just as i was about to go into the store i heard a familiar voice call my name from\nbehind me. It was Dave(not his real name) now Dave is the owner of one of our biggest accounts. His company spends so much money with us it would make a Saudi oil baron\nsay god damn. But Dave is not your usual millionaire. He's your common garden, old torn jeans wearing, muddy boots, swear like a drunk navvy kind of guy. An all round top\nbloke who would not pass you by without asking how you're doing. Anyhow, we got chatting and i invited him out for a spot of lunch. He looked a little embarrassed when he\ntold me that he's not got his wallet with him as he was only out for a walk. Not to worry Dave i have the old corporate card. Lunch is on \"redacted company\"\n\nSo off we go to a restaurant just down the street. We were seated and waited for out waitress to come over. When she did i explained to her that i will be paying with a card\nbut i will give her a tip with cash. She took our orders and while we waited Dave and i got into a heated discussion on who was the best captain on Star Trek and why?\n(did i not mention that we're both massive trekkers. It's how we became friendly in the first place but that for a different story)\n\nOnce our food came we tucked in while still fighting over the whole trek issue. A little while later i manage to catch the eye of our waitress and asked for the bill. She came\nback with the usual print out on a plate with a little smiley face hand drawn on the paper. Urrgh.. don't you just hate that?  anyway, i grabbed my wallet and put the company\ncard down on the plate while taking note of the final bill of £28.00(ish). Working out that a £5.00 tip should be plenty i took out a £20 note(only had two twenties in my wallet)\nand told her to take £5 from it for herself. She seemed happy and said with a smile that she'll be right back with my change.\n\nThen out of the blue some other waitress came over with the little tray and my £20 in hand grumpily saying they had not got any change. Well sorry i replied that's the smallest\ni have just now. Where's our waitress i asked? she replied that her shift ended and she's taken over. Now i knew something was not right here as i looked over my shoulder and\nseen our original waitress in the back looking really upset. \"now do you want your change back or what?\" she asked with a look on her face like i had just fucked her beloved pet dog.\n\nYes, i would like my change back. I stood up, snatched my £20 back then apologised to Dave for the scene i was about to make. And with a whisper i informed this new waitress\nto get the fuck out of my face. She looked shocked like nobody has ever dared to stand up to her attitude before. She was the queen bee and she ruled her land with an iron\nfist. err.. wing. I'm guessing that this new bitch had seen our waitress's tip and somehow bullied her into taking over trying to steal her well earned tip from her. \n\nI walked over to our \"real\" waitress. Dave followed me and i asked if she was ok but you could see she was clearly upset. I asked her to get the manager for me please.\nWhen she returned the manager was just behind. I was calm, i kept my cool while explaining what just happened. He looked over at the other waitress and glared. By the look\ni don't think this was the first time he's had trouble with her. He then tried to apologised to me but i stopped him by saying that i'm not the one who needs hear it it's your hard\nworking friendly waitress standing their next to you. I then held over the £20 to her and she smiled, thanking me.\n\nSorry there is really no ending to this. Well apart from Dave giving the manager a right bollocking about how he is allowing obvious workplace bullying to happen. But the words\nused by Dave are too extreme even for the most hardened of redditors to read. \n\nCould have i handled this better? Probably. Did i just get a grumpy, rude and bullying waitress into trouble or fired?\n\nI fucking hope so. \n\n\n",

        "text": "My local national-chain home center \"unofficially\" welcomes dogs that are not ADA service animals. I like dogs. However, I don’t trust those I don’t know, and I don’t approach them. One day there was a woman with a German Shepherd on a leash right in front of the plant display I was interested in, so I stopped several feet away. In a few seconds the woman led the dog on, saying “Gooood giirrrlll” in a reassuring tone. Fine. I went to the display.\n\nA couple of minutes later as I was selecting my purchase, guess what I heard directly… and I mean DIRECTLY… behind me: “Goooood giiirrrlll.”  The aisles in the indoor plant area are narrow. The dog’s owner had her choice of several open aisles, yet instead she chose to sneak up behind me with her dog, in spite of (or maybe because of) the fact that I had previously refused to approach it. After getting whatever satisfaction she was after by forcing her dog on me, she led it away. (To be perfectly clear, I do not blame the dog, and it did not in any way act aggressively.)\n\nI wrote a letter to the home center’s manager to express my concern that obviously some dog owners don’t care about anyone else’s rights, personal space, or comfort, and I sent a cc to corporate since the dogs/no-dogs permissiveness appears to be on a store-by-store basis and I thought they should know what goes on. Nobody asked me if I was willing to be used as a pet-toy or a pawn in some canine socialization experiment when I came in, and there's no reason for pets and their owners to be using paying customers for agility-course pylons or stalking them as practice-prey.  \n\nNo response. None at all, from either the store manager or corporate. A customer expresses a valid concern about the damage an under-supervised or badly-trained pet might cause in their store if it's unlucky enough to have an owner who's an idiot, and the store reps don’t even bother to acknowledge that concern, even though their “official policy” as I understand it is that only service dogs are permitted in their stores. \n\nScrew 'em. I won't be back.\n\ntl; dr: Stalked by stupid woman and her big dog in the home center; store didn't give a crap.",

Only reason I do that is I have a friend who works there, but he is still training and can't work on everything. So far it's only needed a few oil changes. I brought it in two weeks ago for an oil change and was told by one of their technicians that there is a leak in the transmission. I took the car home and said i'd be back for the leak when my schedule allows. \n\nMy car is under warranty so I called the warranty department at the dealership to confirm the transmission service is covered, it is. I also got two other of my friends who are in training as technicians to confirm there was a leak. I called the service department back and asked to make an appointment for the transmission leak.\n\nTec: Oh no, there's no transmission leak. We just need to replace your front and rear shocks. \n\nMe: Uhhh, what? You just looked at my car two days ago and told me there is a bad leak in the transmission.\n\nTec: Not at all, the shocks are leaking badly, it'll be $1200.\n\nMe: I'd really prefer you double check, I don't have that kind of money for the shocks right now and I would rather you do the major things like the transmission first.\n\nTec: All right I'll check, but I just looked at your car a few days ago and the shocks are really bad.\n\nSo he does check, and OH wouldn't you know? The transmission DOES have a leak, and it would have been a $2,500 repair but my warranty covers it. I bring the car in a few days later to have them work on the transmission.\n\nCustomer Service Lady: Hi UluheFern! So it looks like we are repairing your front and rear shocks today, and it will be $1,200.\n\nMe: Um, no? I talked to the technician and he confirmed this was a transmission job today.\n\nCSL: Oh? He wrote up this bill of service last night and said there was no leak in the transmission.\n\nMe: Well I have written proof from the technician there is in fact, a transmission issue and that was the service to be performed today.\n\nWe go back and forth and FINALLY get the correct paperwork for my car to be worked on. I told them I was very unhappy with the lack of communication and being mislead. \n\nThey end up keeping my car for three days and I had a loaner. I am extremely skeptical of their work and had my friend not been working there I would have never even come back. My friend kept an eye on the car and ensured everything was being worked on correctly. \n\nI got my car back and was still sour and expressed my annoyance at the terrible communication. They still insist on my shocks being replaced, but at this point it won't be with them! ",

One of my friends, who's maturity level is about that of a 14 year old, said he would go out and he suggested we go to a place that rhymes with Bilted Jilt (if you're unfamiliar, it's a chain similar to hooters with a Scottish pub theme and scantily clad waitresses) in the downtown area.  It's only a 5 minute Uber from my hotel, so I didn't complain.\n\nWe arrived at 8:00 PM to a fairly dead house, so we were seated promptly.  About 30 minutes elapsed between the time we were seated and I was starting to get thirsty/hungry (I had flown in from LA earlier that day and if you're familiar with CLE, there's not a lot of dining options around or in the airport).  I finally walked up to the bar and put an order in for 2 beers.  When I got back to the table our waitress, who reeked of cigarettes, comes up and says \"You can't do that, only I can take your drink orders\"\n\"Well we have been sitting here for 30 minutes\"- I replied \n\"Nobody told me I was on my dinner break, what do you want to eat\" she snapped \n\nThis wasn't going to be a good dinner.  \n\nWe put our orders in and she walked away, at that time my buddy and I turned our attention to the football game that was on tv and drank our beers.  \n\nFinishing them up, we tried to find our waitress again to put an order in for two more.  She was nowhere to be found.  I sent my friend up to the bar to get two more beers and he came back ready to go.  He paid for them at the bar, same as I had and kept the receipt, some thing I didn't do.  \n\nFinishing up our second round of beers and watching a nail biter of a game between WVU and Virginia tech, we looked at our watches and it had been an hour since we put our orders in.   I tried tracking down our waitress with no luck so finally I found the manager, who was the only male employee not wearing a kilt.  \n\nI asked where my food was or where my waitress was so we could eat or settle our tabs and get out of there.   Finally our waitress, who had an aura of fresh cigarette smoke surrounding her, comes out and tells us our food will be out in another 30 minutes.  We have been at this restaurant for an hour and a half and it's it's going to be  30 more minutes for my food. \n\nNope. \n\nI asked her to cancel the order and we were just going to leave.  I was hungry at this point, and I will just get some food truck or a pizza slice on my way back to the hotel.    She replied \"I can't cancel the order since they're already making your food\" \n\"Ummm it was ordered an hour ago, where is it?\" My buddy asked\n\"It's still being made ima check on it and tell the cook to stop then I'll get your check\" she stated with an annoyed tone \n\nShe then comes out with the food in to go containers and the bill.  I looked in the to go containers and the burgers were in there, albeit room temperature, like they had been sitting out.  The bill was for our burgers and had 4 beers on it, at $10 each.  \n\nI looked at my buddy and told him this wasn't right and that we needs to find the manager again.  We left our food on the table and began trying to find the manager.  The bartender told us he had left for the evening, and we could talk to our waitress about any bill discrepancies.   \n\nWe left.  Just walked out the front door.\n\nWorst restaurant experience of my life ever.  \n\nEdit: Removed business name, My apologies mods.  ",

We got there at 1230pm with a 200 check out, and it wasn't busy. Surely we'd be good, especially as a table of just two.\n\nWe are seated immediately and go through the menu, both having time to decide what we'll be eating, and I am SUPER indecisive and admittedly easily distracted (sometimes I even forget I'm supposed to be deciding on a meal!). A gentleman brings us water as he delivers drinks to someone seated after us, ok, weird but whatever. \n\n15 minutes since we have been seated and we still have not been greeted (besides the silently placed waters) or even had our drink order taken! I pop up to the hostess stand to see if there was an error and ask where our waiter was. I assume he saw me approach them because as I turn to point out my table he's speaking to my husband.\n\nI swiftly return, ready to order, and he asks if everything is ok. I explain that I was wondering where he was because we had waited so long and was a little concerned because we did have to check out in around an hour. Immediately his smile turns to a glare, which caught me off guard, I was trying to express my concern in a polite manner. He said \"Fine, what do you want?\"\n\nThis caused me to raise my eyebrows. He was being ridiculously unprofessional, so before I ordered I asked if he thought our time frame would be an issue. His response was \"Depends on what you order.\" No suggestion, no apologies, no nothing.\n\nAt this point I turn to my husband and say \"If that's the case we better not risk it\" and stand to leave. He walks off, and I go to the hostess desk and ask to speak to a manager. Now I know this sucks for the waiter but he treated me poorly enough that I literally walked out for the first time ever in my life. EVER.\n\nAs I'm explaining the situation to the manager, he starts pacing behind the manager, glaring at me, and shaking his head to intimidate me. So rude. The manager just says he's sorry and doesn't even offer to seat us elsewhere!!\n\nSo I left a sour review. I didn't expect a comp but at least offer to let us eat at your establishment! If you don't want my business, I won't fight to give it to you.",

        "text": "This is a fairly short story.\n\nThere's a pretty great place I found in my town, which delivers pizza, calzone and a bunch of other stuff for a really great price. And their portions are bigger than others, so I've ordered a few times from this place. After an extremely busy week, I wanted to reward myself by ordering from this location. I added quite a bit of food to eat and put the rest in the fridge for the weekend.\n\nI started to snooze a few minutes after placing the order. Approximately 50 minutes after my order, I got a call. The guy asked whether if I was the one who ordered and said he'll be in the front door soon. Since I wasn't fully awake, I didn't understand the point of his call till he hung up. I tried to give him a call to see whether if he needed me to come downstares but couldn't reach him. In couple minutes, he called me again and the following conversation ensued:\n\n\"Am in the front door.\"  \n\"Do you need me to come downstairs?\"  \n\"Yes am in the front door.\"\n\"Can't you bring it to my apartment?\"  \n\"No come get your food.\"  \n\"Is this a new rule or something?\"  \n\"What?\"  \n\"I mean, is that something your employer doesn't allow you to do anymore? Because I ord...\"  \n(He cuts me) \"COME DOWN AND GET YOUR FOOD!\"\n\nSo I just gave the store a call.\n\n\"Hello, can you please cancel my order and refund me right now?\"  \n\"Sure, which order was this?\"  \n\"The one to tftc street. Your driver refused to bring the food to me, and he literally yelled at me to come down and get my food and I'm not taking that.\"  \n\"I really apologize sir, I will refund you.\"  \n(He steps away and talks with someone else in the store.)  \n\"Sir, if you'd like to take your food, I will still refund your money. I apologize.\"\n\nI don't know whether if I was in the wrong or not. I was actually preparing to step outside when I was on the phone, and if he said that was a rule or if he kindly asked me to come get it because he was tired that would have been fine for me. In the past I have called a store which I ordered from to add additional tip whenever driver looked extremely tired, so I still have a little bit of humanity left in me. But yeah, I wish things didn't go that way.",

        "text": "A previous story about first time car buying prompted me to write about my experience. Rarely do people have good car dealership experiences, so I wanted to share mine.\n\nA few years ago I decided that I needed to upgrade my car. I needed far more work done to the one I owned than it was worth, so I figured I’d shop around before my car completely died. Over the course of the year I did a lot of research, and was pretty confident I knew exactly what I wanted. Finally it got to the point that I couldn’t really wait longer. Since I knew I'd be buying slightly used (2010 – 2012ish), I just had to wait for the \"right\" one to pop up, and to basically test drive whatever did come up. Since this particular car make is super popular in Colorado where I live, I wasn’t too concerned about not being able to find one I liked eventually. \n\nOne day I noticed a luxury car dealership (not of the make of the car I was looking for) near my work had a listing for a white 2010 model I wanted with a sunroof. Sounds great. I called and they said they sold that one the previous day, but did have a 2011 one in black but without the sunroof. I was a bit bummed, but figured a sunroof isn't make-or-break, so I told them I'd swing by on my lunch break.\n\nI got to the dealership and they had washed the car and had it parked in the front ready and waiting for me (for reference, I work at a brewery, so I showed up in jeans, a tank top, a flannel, and boots… not exactly business casual for a woman in her late 20s). The salesman met me promptly at the door and was super welcoming. I sat inside the car and he went over the basics. Since this car was a completely different make than the dealership itself, he had clearly put in some time before I arrived to familiarize himself with this particular car. I knew I loved that exact car the moment I sat inside, even though I had driven about a dozen almost identical ones. \n\nSince this was my first time buying, I was super hesitant to make the purchase. It’s a weird thing to wrap your head around a $15k the first time you do it (except college I guess…. But that’s a whole other topic). I called my dad so I could talk with someone about what was going on in my head since I wasn’t expecting to actually buy the car, and the salesman gave me all the time and space I needed. When I finally went back inside he wasn’t pushy, and waited for me to say I was absolutely ready. I had already been approved for a loan. My credit union has this sweet reciprocity program thing 50 or so dealerships around the area, so the actual financing part was a complete breeze and cut down on paperwork. The whole time the salesman kept asking if I needed water, or if I had any questions, and was friendly the entire time. \n\nWhen I was finished at it was time to take the keys, he gave me a nice gift bag with the keys, the manual, and a few dealership gifts. Then he escorted me to my car which had a giant red bow on it like in commercials. I was stunned. While filling out paperwork they had detailed the car and made it showroom ready for me. They took my picture with the car, and even sent me a “happy car anniversary” card a year later.\n\nI was so impressed. Even though I was purchasing one of the cheapest cars on their lot, they still treated me as if I were buying a $100,000 luxury car. I was probably the prime example of the type of person to ignore (young woman, dressed down, first time buyer, looking at a used car), but they made the whole experience really great.\n",

        "text": "I've been going to the same grocery store for the past 3 years and about 3 times total I've asked for a roll of quarters in my cash back when I've been in dire need and couldn't go to the bank. Every cashier has been more than happy to give me a roll and I've always been super thankful as I know they need their change to run their business.\n\nUntil this one fateful day. I'm at the check out register. The cashier was an elderly man who I've never seen before, so he might have been new. The bagger was a guy who was probably in his mid - early 20's, and I know he's been working there for a while. I go to this store once a week for the past 3 years, and I remember the familiar faces. All my groceries were scanned and before I slide my card to pay...\n\n&gt;Me: If I request 10 dollars in cash back, could you possibly give me a roll of quarters?\n\n&gt;Cashier: I don't know what change I have in my drawer.\n\n&gt;Me: I can request the cash back, and when the drawer opens, can you check then? If you don't have a roll, I can just take a 10 dollar bill.\n\n&gt;Cashier: I don't know what I have in my drawer.\n\n*Before I could say anything else, the bagger interrupts...*\n\n&gt;Bagger: We don't do that here.\n\n&gt;Me: I've gotten a roll many times before with no issue.\n\n&gt;Bagger: We don't do that here.\n\n&gt;Me: Okay, bye.\n\nThe bagger had a smug look on his face and an attitude like he was so proud he shut me down. I was kind of embarrassed and had frozen food, so I didn't stick around or argue any more. They both just repeated themselves with no explanation. I was pissed off. I wasn't pissed I didn't get quarters, I was pissed on how they handled it.\n\nWhen I got home, I explained the situation on the \"contact us\" form on the store website and asked for more clarification as to why it was okay before, but suddenly now they \"don't do that here.\" A week went by with no response. So I went to the ethics website (for the company that owns the grocery store company) and filed a complaint for dishonesty. \n\nI got a call from someone in corporate a day later and he explained the policy:\n\n&gt;\"If a customer asks for quarters, the store must give them a roll of quarters if there is an ample supply to do so and the store can still run the business. If the cashier doesn't have a roll in their drawer, they must ask the manager to check behind the customer service counter for more, and if there isn't an ample amount to be able to give the customer a roll, only the manager can tell the customer no, not the employee.\"\n\nThe corporate guy said he was going to speak to the manager at the store and remind them of the policy and recommend they let the employees know. Funny, after that, the manager finally finds time to email me back explaining the policy and they he has spoken with the employees. I replied saying I understand the policy as I already spoke to corporate dude and I want to put it all behind me.\n\nI'm just happy I know the policy now and I dare that bagger to hit me again with a \"We don't do that here\" next time I ask for quarters.\n\nEdit: If you're going to call me a cunt or an asshole, at least tell me why because I'd really like to know why it is so bad that I wanted to know what their policy was and that the manager was made aware of an employee giving out wrong information.

        "text": "Okay, so I just bought a new car. This is my first time financing a car, and christ, people aren’t kidding when they say car buying is a fucking nightmare.\n\nI tried to make things easy by contacting the dealership and telling them exactly what car I wanted in which color, judging their inventory online. I bring my mother with me because she’s my lifeline. She looks out for me, my happiness, and my comfort levels. Plus, she’s bought many many cars throughout her lifetime. I trust her and her advice. \n\nJust a bit of a back story: I’m a financial consultant at a bank. I deal with people and their finances all day, every day. As soon as I clock out, my work brain goes off. Once again, I’m a first time buyer so I figured I wasn’t going to get approved for the 0% financing they were offering, but it wouldn’t hurt to try. It didn’t really matter to me, I needed a new car, I left work early (and now have to make up those hours on Friday, a day that I was supposed to have off), I’m leaving with a car. Push comes to shove, I’ll refinance with the bank I work for in 6-8 months, maybe a year.\n\nI arrive to the appointment on time, find the guy I’m supposed to talk to and he hooks me up with a sales person. We’ll call him Harvey.\n\nHarvey seemed nice…at first. If anything, he was just really annoying from the get go. Very overbearing. No sense of personal space. Really loud. Obnoxious. I could not deal with him. Anytime I’d try talking to my mom (nothing about the car or finances, just chit chatting with her about my day) he comes out of nowhere and loudly interrupts us with some random ass personal questions. “I just can’t believe you’re mother and daughter! When did you deliver her?” This is a common theme throughout the 4 hours we were there.\n\nHe has me fill out the credit check paperwork and as I’m filling it out, I pull my phone out because they need numbers and addresses for references. He says “If we want to get this done quickly, you need to fill this out” Anytime throughout this process if I pulled my phone out, he assumed I was not committed to filling out the paperwork and was dicking around. I said “I’m aware you need this, I’m getting reference numbers and addresses to put in these areas you highlighted” “Oh”, he’d say. \n\nThe entire time I’m trying to fill out this paperwork, he’s nitpicking everything. “You didn’t fill out this line” “Well yeah, because I haven’t gotten to it yet, I’m working on the line above it right now…” “Well everything highlighted needs to be filled out” “Yeah I got that, if I have any questions, I’ll ask you” \n\nBut he fucking continued hovering over me while filling this out, making comments here and there and talking to me like I’m a child (fill this out, this out and this out whatever is highlighted MOTHERFUCKER I KNOW). Eventually, I snapped at him and told him he really needed to be quiet and back off. \n\nAnyways, he takes my application, brings it back and says “you put $0.00 in the rent box” Well, I don’t pay rent, I live with my mother. “Oh, well put like $100.00 in the line, it makes you look responsible” Dude, I fill out loan applications for various different things for a living. No one has gotten denied or has been told they’ll look “more responsible” for something in the rent box if they’re not paying rent. My mom steps in at this point and tells him to take the application to whoever he needs to take it to.  \n\nThey tell me I’m not gonna get the 0% financing and insist on my mother cosigning. I said absolutely not. I don’t want anyone on the car but myself, what can you offer me, I might be able to get you X%, okay let me run some numbers, yada yada, yeah that’s that’s cool. \n\nSo then Harvey tells me he needs my proof of insurance. I pull out my phone to get started on that, and 2 minutes later he brings me another sheet where I again have to write out my references, and I said “Okay, I’ll get right on that right after I email you my proof of insurance” He begins to walk away but turns right back around to say, pretty aggressively, “Blondekay, They need THIS *points to reference sheet* immediately.” I responded, exasperated, “Dude, I’m trying to send you my proof of insurance, which is what I just told you. I’m not dicking around on my phone here, I’m trying to get you what you need. Do you want the insurance shit first or do you want the paper filled out first?” He says the paper. Fine. Great. So I still need my phone for those phone numbers again, and he repeats himself “They need this right away” “Harvey, walk away” So we get all of that out of the way and then they bring the car I want around so I can drive it.\n\nI’ve been driving a car built in the 90s since I started driving, so I’m not used to the fancy way of turning on the windshield wipers, or the headlights, or using the fancy shifter. Instead of showing me how, he does it himself and gets in the backseat. We start driving, it’s been raining all day, we’re on backroads that I’m not familiar with, these brakes are super tight compared to what I’m used to, I’m doing the speed limit and trying to be careful. After all, this isn’t my car yet and the rain is my enemy. \n\nFirst thing I did when I got the car to turn on was turn the A/C off. My mom and I were freezing.\n\nHe starts asking why I’m not going faster. I tell him it’s raining, I’m trying to be careful. He says “Well fine then, let’s just turn around and go back to the dealership” I respond by laughing at him and saying no, we will keep driving. \n\nHe then proceeds to reach over from the backseat with the top half of his body and says “look at this, look at this, look at this” etc, (and turns the A/C on…which he watched me turn off previously) and then decides to turn the car into manual. While I’m driving. In the pouring rain. I can’t even drive manual nor am I worried about it. I tell him this. He switches it back, but continues to reach over and distract the fuck out of me while I’m driving. He switches the car to manual 2 more times. \n\nHe decides he’s going to be a driving instructor and tells me to “slow down” (I was doing the speed limit), and to “stop at the stop sign” (no shit?) and, once again, tight breaks, I am breaking a little early to slow down, trying to get comfortable and he tells me “Stop breaking and go up to the line at the stop sign” I say “No Harvey, I’m just gonna  come to a complete stop 10 feet away from the sign” My mom says she’s cold, I say me too, I turned the A/C off, but I guess Harvey was hot. Harvey says oh no, I’m not hot! Dude, I watched you turn it on, lol. He then rolls the window down while it’s pouring down raining. If you’re hot bro, just say that…\n\nWe eventually make it back to the dealership, and he leaves us alone for the most part, randomly interrupting our conversations while we’re trying to entertain ourselves to ask more personal questions or to talk about his family. He then says that if we get a survey, don’t bother taking it if we won’t give him a 10. It’ll effect his commission, he says. I don’t even respond. He also says these two ladies that just bought a car are really nice, and it’s easier to be nice than nasty (passive aggressive!) I laugh that he thinks I’m being nasty for no reason.\n\nTime goes by, he wants to show us the service station. He starts walking towards it and then turns around outta nowhere to show us the vending machine instead. Acts offended when we told him we don’t want anything, we’re good, thank you. Takes us into the service station, out of ear shot from everyone, and gives us a “real talk” about the survey again. I try to be polite when I say “Dude, look, I get it. I get graded too. The difference between you and I is I like to know how I can improve. You’re clearly comfortable being the way you are, and you clearly know how you are if you beg customers to not take a survey. After tonight, I will not be dealing with you ever again.”\n\nImmediately after, we go to the financing guy. He brings up a plan that they offer and my mom asks about how their GAP works, gives a personal experience to what happened to her, and he proceeds to imply she’s an idiot and a liar. He didn’t flat out call her these things, but the implication was definitely there. She explodes because it’s been me being the “nasty” one all night, it’s her turn. We almost leave, we don’t because I just want this night to be finished. We get shit done, the finance guy more or less runs over to the sales manager to let him know that we were pissed, he comes over and tries to be polite, we were in no mood to be pleasant at this point, so we more or less shrugged him off. The cherry on top is I was supposed to get 2 sets of keys. I got one set, because they can’t find the other set. /facepalm\n\nI should have left tbh.",

        "text": "I hope this fits here. The first part of the story is relevant to this sub, the second part adds some more chuckles.\n\nYears ago I was in a long-term relationship and we loved the outdoors. We went to BigCampingStore and bought ourselves a very nice lightweight camping tent. We spent many trips together in this tent and I still have fond memories of those times.\n\nLong story short, we eventually broke up. As we were sorting through our common property, I said I didn't want much, but I would like the tent.\n\nMy ex said, \"But only if you're not going to sleep with any other girls in there!\" \n\nI was the one doing the breaking up and was unnecessarily feeling a bit guilty about it all (we just weren't a good fit, no big drama of cheating or anything) so I said, \"Okay, I won't sleep in the tent with other women.\"\n\nOf course this was promise that was going to be difficult to keep. So I had an idea. BigCampingStore had a very generous return policy, so I went to their Customer Service desk. I told the CSR the whole story...how my ex and I had bought the tent together, we broke up and I got to keep it with the caveat of not using it with another woman. The poor young CSR actually listened to my whole story with a very good retail smile. \n\nI said, \"So what if I return the tent to you, you refund my money and then I buy the exact same tent back? That way it will be 'my' tent, not 'our' tent.\" \n\nThe CSR said, \"No problem, we can do that!\"\n\nThe CSR then accepted my return and gave me $237 in store credit (what I paid for the tent originally). She then said, \"Well, since it's an older model tent, I can't  actually sell it back to you for the same price. I will have to sell it back to you for $109.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said, clueless as to what just took place.\n\nI finished up my other shopping there and went home. The next day, it dawned on me of what happened. I had just scored! I had just bought my practically brand-new tent for $109 instead of the $237 I had originally paid for it. At first I felt a little guilty as I had clearly just cost BigCampingStore some real money. But the guilt has paid off for them...there has been several items I had wanted to return for various reasons but decided against it...to work off my karma with the store, probably in their favor now.\n\nA couple years later, I noticed the rainfly of the tent was flaking. The waterproofing material on the underside of the rainfly was peeling off. Not good. After my good score with BCS, I wasn't going back to the store for a second return. I had no idea what the manufacture warranty was, but I contacted them anyways. They said, \"Yep, we've had some issues with the flys on those tents. Send it in for repair.\" So I sent in the whole tent setup to them. A couple weeks later, I get a package from the tent maker. They had sent me a 100% brand new tent! The other one wasn't that worn at that point, but 100% new is all the better. I was thrilled.\n\nSo the cows.\n\nWe moved to the countryside. Lots of cows around. My new SO and I had gone camping and when we came home, I set up the tent in the backyard to make sure it's totally dry. It's self-standing tent, meaning the tent poles keep it upright and no tent stakes are necessary for it to hold shape. My mistake. A breeze came along and picked up the tent. It scraped across a barbed-wire fence, leaving huge gashes in the thin fabric. It must've happened at night and in the morning I find the tent just over the fence and had clearly been stepped upon by cows and was smeared in fresh cow poo. The tent poles were slightly bent, probably lost much of their strength (wouldn't do well in high winds), but we still use the poles today.\n\nWe found a SmallerCampingStore that was willing to sell us the body of the tent, sans the poles and rainfly. It think it was about $70. Since the poles were serviceable and the rainfly was not on during the barbed-wire/cow fiasco, we once again had a mostly new tent. Still using the tent these days, in fact we just spent the weekend in it and had a great time in the mountains.",

        "text": "Sorry for the length of the post, I'm a rambler.\n\nI decided recently to switch banks. Mine's been annoying me for a while, and having recently bought a new Android and discovering they don't support Android pay (in the year I've had access to Apple pay, I've gotten pretty used to not bothering with my wallet and I don't want to have to start again), I decided it was time.\n\nOne of the banks in my area that does support Android pay also has a promo on where opening a new account gets you $300. Yay! Who doesn't want $300?! So I went through the application on their website and received a confirmation that said to go to any location within the next three weeks to complete the account opening and get my new debit card.\n\nI was off work super early today, so I decided to go get it done. Walked up to the greeting counter where there stood a hipster looking fellow whose beard was apparently so heavy he couldn't smile, and explained why I was there. Once he had finished making a big deal of my not having an appointment, he wandered off to see if there was anyone available to help me. Fortunately the first office he walked into contained someone who was free as a bird, so she came out to greet me. The first thing she said was, \"I hear you opened your own account online by yourself! Good for you!\"\n\nOkay, so I'm 24. I look 24. One time I tried to hand my ID to a cashier in a liquor store and he said, \"Pfffffft! I don't need to see that! You're obviously not underage!\" I'm not dressed up professionally or anything (I work with dogs so my work outfit is old jeans, a tank top, a hoodie, my hair pulled back, and no makeup), but I'm pretty obviously old enough to handle my own banking and navigate the internet without it being too much of a shock to anyone.\n\nDespite my lurking doubts about this bank caused by unpleasant hipster greeter and the advisor's condescending tone, I followed her into her office to continue the setup. I'm a millennial - I'll put up with a lot for $300 and the ability to pay for things with my phone. She asked for ID, so I handed her my driver's license and sat back and waited while she inputted my information. While she was typing, my phone made a noise to let me know I had a message. Sure, she seems like she'll be busy a while, so I pulled out my phone and answered the message. A minute later, it went off again. Again, I pulled it out to answer. As I was typing the response to the second message, she said to me, \"You can answer that!\"\n\n*Gee thanks*, I thought, *it's wonderful to have your permission to use my own phone. Especially when I'm already doing it.* \"I am.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you can answer!\"\n\nI didn't know how to respond to that, so I just continued texting until she handed me a piece of paper to sign. Covering the vast majority of the text on the paper with her hand, she pointed to a line labeled \"Parent/Guardian signature,\" told me to sign there, and stared at me expectantly without moving her hand.\n\n\"Do you want me to sign in the parent/guardian spot, or the one over here that says 'primary account holder'?\" I asked, trying very hard to keep the sarcasm out of my voice.\n\n\"Oh, on the primary account holder spot! Wait, are you over 18?\" This was after she'd spent 5 minutes inputting the information from my driver's license into her computer, and I could clearly see my date of birth listed on her monitor, followed by \"age: 24.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm 24.\" No chance of sarcasm-free tone now.\n\n\"Oh, you look young!\"\n\nShe still hadn't taken her hand off the text on the paper she wants me to sign, so I told her I'd like to read it before I signed it. Still without moving her hand, she started to explain the text. I repeated that I'd like to read it, and she finally moved her hand.\n\nOnce the paper was read and signed, she said, \"Okay, now we're going to walk over to the ATM and set up your four-digit PIN! Can you think of a four-digit number in your mind?\"\n\nI have no idea how I managed to get through the process without asking her to stop talking to me like a child, but somehow I made it through and now have an account set up. I think I may contact their customer service and give them a heads up, or I might just make a point of avoiding that branch and seeing if the others are better. If not, I guess I'll just have to keep my fingers crossed that other banks will pick up Android pay soon, and then take my $300 and run.",

        "text": "I had braces a few years ago, and when I had them taken off, I was given a retainer to wear a couple of nights a week to make sure my teeth stay straight and don't move back to how they were before. Anyway, one of the retainers cracked, so we ordered a new one. The problem came when we went to pick it up.\n\nIt was just one of those days. Everything had gone wrong, we were running really tight on time and we get to the top of the stairs (which are numerous, narrow and steep) at the dentist's office before I realise 'aren't we meant to be going to the orthodontist?'.\n\nMe and my mother *ran* to the car and drove like crazy to get to the orthodontist which is on the other side of town. My mum drops me off outside the door and goes to find a parking space because we were on the exact minute when I was meant to have my appointment. I hurry in, get stuck behind an idiot who can't work out how to use the sign-in screen (i.e. can't read). By the time she's gone and I sign in (using the perfectly-functioning sign-in screen) I'm only 1 or 2 minutes late, but nevertheless, I get told to just sit in the waiting area and I'll get called when they have a free slot.\n\n**45 minutes later:** Still waiting. My mum calls me asking where tf I am. I explain that I'm still waiting to be called.\n\n**Another 10 minutes later:** My mother quietly storms into the waiting area and asks the receptionist wtf is taking so long (but in a polite way, which I could not have managed at that point). We get told to go upstairs and wait there. This feels like progress, right? Spoiler: it's not.\n\nNow, the upstairs 'waiting room' consists of one two-person seat wedged between two doors each leading to an orthodontist's room. So we sit there, and realise that one of the rooms we are *right next to* is the one where my appointment is meant to be. After a few minutes, people walk out, and go back downstairs. We debate what to do, but a second later, the next people come up and go in.\n\nAfter they leave, the next people come up. We still haven't been called. At this point, we've been waiting for **over an hour** (about 1 hour, 10 minutes). I decide that if we're not called in next, I'm going to go in and say *'look, we've been waiting for an hour, all you need to do is hand me my retainer and I can leave, it will take you all of 3 seconds.'*\n\nBut before I can do that, a receptionist comes down the stairs (there's a lot of stairs in this place) and says 'are youRealWitchyMermaid?'\n\nMe: 'Yes?'\n\nHER: 'Oh, we've been calling you downstairs for 10 minutes.' I.e. they called us right after we were told to move to an area where they don't have the PA system so how the fuck would you know if you were being called?\n\nAngry, but containing it, we follow her upstairs. I go into the orthodontist's room (a different one to the one we were told to/usually go to), get my retainer and we're out of the building within a minute.\n\nAll this for being less than 3 minutes late.\n\n**TL;DR** Had to pick up a retainer, was 1 or 2 minutes late because the lady signing in before me couldn't use a basic sign-in system and then they made me wait an hour and a half for an appointment that took less than 10 seconds.\n\nIt was a shame, because until that point, the service there had always been great. Needless to say, I'm now glad that (barring disaster) I won't ever have to go back there.",

A couple days later I received an email that I \"never picked up my oven from the factory\" and that the purchased would be refunded. Sure enough, I check my bank account and $700 was refunded to me while the oven is in my kitchen. Me, having a guilty conscious, called customer service to get this settled. I explain to the first person I speak to the situation (that I have a free oven in my kitchen) and he transfers my call. Next I talk to someone in appliances. I explain to them that I was refunded for an item that I have. The woman explained that she had never dealt with a situation like this and transferred me to her manager. After waiting on hold for 15+ minutes, I explain my story a third time before being transferred again to the factory directly. This person transfers me to the credit department where I hold and explain again. Finally, I'm told to call my local store... which makes no sense at all. I call them. Explain the situation again. The guy is literally rude to me and says there's nothing he can do about an online purchase.\n\nI tried SIX TIMES to give people $700. ",

I'm not on mobile so any formatting errors are my own fault and should be thoroughly ridiculed in the comments.  \n  \nThis story takes place about a month ago. I had just moved to a new town that is about two hours away from my hometown where I had been living for some time. Since most of my kitchenware was still packed away in various boxes I decided to order out for lunch from a pizza chain just up the road that rimes with Pizza Butt. I grab my laptop and within a few minutes I've submitted an online order. As soon as I hit the submit button this message appears on the screen.  \n  \nYour order will be available for pickup in X amount of time at (Old Hometown)'s location.  \n  \nShit. I didn't update my account so it just sent it to the location I usually order from, a location that is now two hours away. No big deal I'll just call the store and cancel the order, it's been no time at all so they probably haven't even started making it yet. I quickly google the number for the store and give them a ring. The conversation goes like this. I'll be \"M\" and confused employee will be \"CE\".  \n  \nCE: \"Hello this is Pizza Place, how can I help you?\"  \nM: \"Hi, I just moved and was trying to order a Pizza but I sent my order to the wrong location and I need to cancel the order.\"  \nCE: \"What's your name?\"  \nM: \"the_dead_faux\"  \nCE: \"Yeah, okay, this is carry out, I don't need your address.\"  \nM: \"Huh?\"  \nCE: \"Your order is for carry out, you just have to come pick it up.\"  \nM: \"I can't pick it up, I don't live in (Hometown) anymore.\"  \nCE: \"It doesn't matter where you live, this order is for carry out, just come pick it up at (Store Location).\"  \nM: \"I literally can't do that, I live two hours away now\"  \nCE: \"We don't need to know where you live, carry out means you come get the pizza yourself.\"  \nM: \"Can you please just cancel my order?\"  \nCE: \"Are you sure?\"  \nM: \"...yes.\"  \n  \nI'm not sure if there was some kind of miscommunication going on, or maybe I just didn't explain myself clearly, but my brain was thoroughly wrinkled after that exchange.",

        "text": "Short back story before we begin: My wife and I started working in food service, first in a well know \"mexican\" fast food place and then in a buffet restaurant where the \"waiters\" made tipping wages even though all they did was try to get drinks to make it easier and remove plates from the table when a guest was finished eating from it (something I failed at doing during my time working there, so I know I'm not cut out to be a waiter). All names have been changed.\n\nSo back to the story at hand. We live about an hour and a half away from a larger city and tend to visit a particular restaurant whenever we drive there due to the atmosphere, service, and of course the amazing food. We were finishing up a long vacation with our family and my sister and her son and decided to stop in and introduce them to this awesome restaurant while we were there. Six people, on a Saturday night, wait time for the table around 30 minutes, not a big deal. After 40 minutes I go up to check on our table and the hostess looks worried while trying to find our group on her tablet. She says she needs to check at the other stand and I am hearing them go back and forth saying things like \"you can just bump them back into the queue\" before realizing I'm within ear shot and promptly find a table to seat us in (a section that is half empty, I might add).\n\nAnother 10 minutes go by without a waiter even comping up to our table. My wife notices one at the next table and starts talking to us about the wait and wondering when we might get service. This waiter comes around and says he's sorry about our wait and \"D\" will be our waiter. This waiter, \"Matt\", gets our drink order, and brings it back even before we see our waiter. He then gets our order, including helping us pick meals for two kids on the autism spectrum (various textures tend to make it hard for them to eat, so no small feat if you don't know them) just picking up queues from us and not needing an explanation or getting upset or flustered by it. After about 10 more minutes, D comes around and starts apologizing stating that he is sorry because they have sat so many tables in his section and he is just getting over whelmed (once again a primarily empty section). After hearing the 5 minute explanation he says he'll get us refills for our drinks and check on our order.\n\n10 minutes later, Matt shows up and checks on us, saying that D is really good and will start showing it, and he'll make sure D's coming with our refills. The refills come out with our appetizers and all is well for another 15 minutes or so. Another waiter comes by with the food, and proceeds to set a plate in front of my daugher. Upon asking who had the second plate, we realize that none of the rest of our food is there, and this order was for another table. At which point the waiter picks up the plate, and proceeds to bring it to another table and serve it to the intended guest (after at least 2 other non-staff members have touched it at this point). \n\nAbout the time we are waiting for another refill D shows up with our food order and proceeds to hand my 9 year old son a hot plate fresh from the kitchen. I reach up and clear a spot for it and help him just before he drops it on the table from the heat as he's saying \"hot, hot, hot\" repeatedly. Matt walks around the corner as D hands my wife a plate which she states is hot for her. Matt looks at him and just starts in \"we never hand hot plates to guests.\" Then to my wife, \"are you ok? I'm really sorry about that.\" He helps pass out the remaining food while my wife explains that we are more worried about my son that was handed it than her. So Matt takes D by the shoulder and leads him to the kitchen talking to him about what just happened.\n\nD comes back a little later to check and see who needs refills. And starts saying things like \"I'll get them back quick cause mama looks tired\" referencing my wife. He makes his leave quickly before she can react and Matt comes back around to apologize again for the plates and says he'll make sure D will be back with our refills. Another 10 minutes later and D comes back with refills making another comment like \"I better keep moving, I don't want to get on mama's bad side.\" Our meals here come with a small dish of icecream, so D takes the orders and is back within 5 minutes with them and drops the checks off with us after asking how we are splitting the check.\n\nHe hands us one tray for both checks and states he'll be back in a bit, \"cause mama looks tired and he doesn't want to make her wait.\" We both place our receipt with the cards we're using in the tray and D comes back and asks \"wait, you had me split it and are using one card for both bills?\" So we have to explain how both cards are there for our bills. He then brings them back and ends our dining experience with \"I'm gonna tell my manager to stop seating me these parties, I just can't keep up with all of them.\" (On a Saturday night with a half empty section). Matt sees us and wishes us well on the way out of the main restaurant (after we tip D a big fat 0 on both checks).\n\nSo we stop at the hostess stand and ask to speak with the manager. She was there in under 5 minutes and listens to our experience. She about faints when we tell her he handed our son the plate and stops us to make sure his hands are fine and not burnt or still hurting. She then starts to go pale as we finish and throw in all the \"mama\" comments along with the final \"they can't seat my section anymore.\" We explain that if it wasn't for Matt, we would have left well before dessert and wouldn't be coming back. She stated that Matt is the best waiter on staff and she wishes she had ten more of him. Since the cards had been run on D's account, she couldn't move them to Matt's to tip him. She ended up, after hearing how far we live from the restaurant, comping about half of our meal and said she'd make sure Matt was taken care of, while promising D will be getting a fair amount of coaching on the whole experience this night.",

In Access Point Mode it does not hand out IP addresses to devices that connect to the WiFi and also doesn't seem to assign itself an IP, instead it allows the wired network to handle that. So I am at a point now where I cannot administer the device, since I cannot access it's IP address in a browser to get to the web management interface.\n\nNote: I am a Systems Administrator by day, so it is not a lack of networking knowledge causing my issues. That being said I am leaving a lot of technical detail out of this post, but don't take that as a sign that I don't know what I am talking about.\n\nSo I reach out to the vendor's support with roughly the following message:\n&gt;I am unable to access the Web Interface of the router anymore. I'd like to factory reset it, but all documentation that I could find references a factory reset button, that this router does not appear to have unless I am missing something.\n\nVendor's response roughly:\n&gt;I understand that you would like to do factory reset, but you are unable to access the web interface of your router. I apologize for the inconvenience caused and I will be more than happy to help you.\n&gt;In this case, I suggest you the below link to factory reset the router. Please follow the instructions given in the link.\n&gt;https://www.vendor.com/support/faq/1004955/\n\nI follow that above link, and second step (first step was powering it on) was to access the router's web interface! So I respond to tech support with roughly the following:\n&gt;Unfortunately that doesn't help me as I an unable to get the web interface to load at all. My problem wasn't that I didn't know the URL, but that the URL (router.vendor.com) or any combination of IP Addresses that I could think of do not load the login page. It is stuck in Access Point mode and is not assigning itself an IP address for me to access it through.\n\nVendor's response roughly:\n&gt;I understand that the factory reset does not help you to get web interface. I apologize for the inconvenience and I will be more than happy to help you.\n&gt;In this case, I suggest you to update the firmware of your router by following the instructions given below:\n&gt;1) Download and extract the firmware for your router from &lt;link&gt;\n&gt;2) Access the router's web interface\n\nThis is where the issue stands as clearly the tech support representative did not understand the issue and I had lost patience at the time.

I walked over to this lady and said, as politely as I could:\n\nMe: Excuse me, ma'am, but the line to check out starts over there.\n\nI point to the sign near register 2 that literally says \"Line Starts Here.\"\n\nOL: Well, I'm in this line, so I'm fine.\n\nShe continues unloading her cart.\n\nMe: Actually, it's kinda like a bank - you don't wait in line for a specific register, you wait in that line over there and are called to the next open register when it is your turn.\n\nShe wrinkles her wrinkles at me (I dunno, it happened though).\n\nOL: I don't think that's how it works.\n\nI appeal to the chashier:\n\nMe: Ma'am, am I misunderstanding how this works?\n\nCashier: *sheepishly* No, you're correct. You are next in line.\n\nOL: *with max grumpitude* Well, that's now how *I* see it.\n\n\nMe: You know what, you can see it any way you want as long as you see it from the back of that line.\n\nShe was absolutely steaming... as she loaded her cart back up and moved to the back of the line.",

        "text": "A few years ago a friend and I went to a local brunch spot during a non-busy week day. We were greeted by our hostess and seated. \n\nWe sat down and looked over our menu, when our server came over and just kinda looked at us and sighed. We asked to have another minute to look it over. The server grunted and left. No introduction, no hi how are you. Ok, that's fine, people have bad days!\n\nShe comes back about 30 seconds later, and we order our meals. It's brought out very quickly as the place was nearly empty. We had just begun to eat when our server brings over the check. We figured, ok cool. Been there almost 10 minutes but thanks for being prompt!\n\nWe're about halfway done eating, when our server comes back and picks up the check book, we had not paid yet because we were not done eating and I wanted to order something else. The server huffed at us and said, \"you gonna pay?\" I said yes but, we're not done eating yet and I wanted to order something else. The server just tosses the check back on the table and leaves. Didn't take my order, ok whatever. \n\nShe comes back again, we're almost finishing up, and she straight up asks as \"Can you pay your check and go now?\" while I was absolutely shocked, my friend just ignored her and kept chatting with me. The place was not busy, we were not quite done with our food, and I wanted to chat some more with my friend. The server who had the check book again tossed it at her and grunted about us having to pay, my friend just gave her a glare and said \"when we are ready\". \n\nAt this point I just wanted to leave, we had been there about 25 minutes, felt uncomfortable and the server was constantly glaring at us from across the restaurant. I told my friend we should leave and she paid with a 15% tip, we were both in food service and pretty upset with the rude server, but hey.\n\nThe server saw we were paying and ran over, took a look at the 15% tip and made this awful groan-hiss sound and said \"Seriously? 15% that's it?\" and left. \n\nI didn't write a review because we don't go there often enough and maybe she was having a shitty day, but no conversation whatsoever, being pushy about the check and the tip, and tossing our payment and meals onto the table made it quite a bad experience.

        "text": "This happened a while ago, and we haven’t frequented the restaurant in question since, but another story reminded me of it so I thought I’d share.\n\nMyself, my mother, my sister and my SO are all out for a meal (I honestly can’t remember if it was lunch or dinner anymore) at a great restaurant that we’ve been to a few times before because they’re really good with handling allergies (my sister is gluten free).  It’s a tapas and larger share plates restaurant, so we’re all enjoying nibbling at a variety of different dishes and chatting.  \n\nOne of the dishes we got was a special of some marinated and pan fried prawns, sounded delicious.  Mum was the first person to try one, but she took one bite and put it back saying he thought it tasted a little off.  We decide we need a different person to taste it, in case maybe the marinade or something just isn’t agreeing with Mum, because honestly we all think it’s pretty unlikely we’ve been given off prawns.  I’m curious, so I volunteer and have a bite.  Well Mum is right, something about it just tastes a little funky.  We don’t know what is wrong with it, but at this point we haven’t even eaten one full prawn (out of a pile of 6 or 8) so we decide to send it back.  \n\nWe wait until a server pops over to ask how everything is an let them know something about the prawns doesn’t taste right to us, and we’d like to send them back.  The server assures us the prawns are fresh and that there’s nothing wrong with them.  Still, we say we’re not comfortable eating them, have barely touched them and don’t want them.  He picks them up, takes them back to the kitchen and we thought that was that.\n\nObviously not.\n\nWe see him walking back to our table with the same dish we sent back.  He arrives and tells us that he relayed our concerns to the Chef, who says there’s nothing wrong with the prawns and told him to bring them back to our table! To put it frankly, we’re all a bit flabbergasted.  Mum pipes up first and says something to the effect of “Well I’m a Chef too, and I think there’s something wrong with it.” And I add “I think how little of it we’ve touched shows that we won’t be  eating it.  Please just take it away.  We don’t like it or want it, the Chef’s opinion of it doesn’t change that.” So he left again.  I admonished my Mum for her comment, because it sounded pretty uppity IMO.  She said she just wanted them to know she did in fact have industry experience, and wasn’t trying to be deliberately difficult.  I suspect it had the opposite effect.\n\nThe server comes back again.  Still with the plate.  He said he is sorry for interrupting (as he places the dish back on the table), but the Chef said that you (directing his comment at my mother) are a liar, because any Chef would know there is nothing wrong with this dish.  While we’re all still in shock at this person calling my mother a liar straight to her face he leaves.  \n\nMy sister immediately flags over another server and asks to speak to a manager.  We explain the whole situation.  The manager leaves to speak to the Chef and the server.  When he comes back he tells us that the server (who appears to South American maybe, we hadn’t really thought about it prior to this) speaks English as a second language, and he would never be rude to a table on purpose so his comment about Mum being a liar must have an issue with the language barrier.  He says this about a server who has had no problem maintaining conversation with us, in perfect English for the whole time we’ve been there.  The manager goes on to tell us that normally they wouldn’t remove food from the bill simply because a guest didn’t like it, but given the misunderstanding we had with our server he would make an exception, but he stressed there was absolutely nothing wrong with the prawns – it was us that was the problem.  \n\nAt this point we requested the bill, paid, didn’t tip, and promptly left.  This whole interaction had probably taken place over a period of 20 – 30 minutes, so we had finished eating by now.  My mother and sister both work in hospitality, you better believe they bad mouthed this place to everyone they knew.  I work in corporate, and am solely responsible for booking in functions and business lunches, which were never hosted at this restaurant again.  I sometimes hear similar stories of mistreatment by their staff from other people, apparently their rudeness wasn’t a on off occurrence, but amazingly they’re still open. ",

I decided to share because of all the 'check in the back' stories recently posted on /r/TalesFromRetail.\n\nI was a very little kid with my sister and father in a mall pet store. At the time, my sister was raising Zebra Finches, which are cute tiny little birds with orange beaks. \n\nWe get the attention of an associate and my sister points to the one she wants. The associate grabs a net (one of the ones with metal wire around the net) and proceeds to flail around the cage trying to catch it. Instead of catching the bird with the net, the associate managed to smack it with the edge and it fell down to the bottom of the cage motionless. They then picked up the limp bird, handed it to another employee, and told them \"Put it in the back with the others.\"\n\nNever been keen on asking employees to check the back since then; I just imagine a room full of piles of dead birds. \"Put it in the back with the others\" did become a family joke though, so at least there's that.",

This made me curious and when the server came for our order, I asked about it. I'm quite aware she has no say in the pricing or selection, I was just curious. I ask the nice server, how is X beer a premium import? She launches into her spiel about premium cultivated lists from around the world, blah blah blah. I ask her if she knows where X beer is brewed. She doesn't know. \"It sounds German\". I tell her the premium imported beer I'm referring to is brewed right here in our state as has been for 150 years. It is heavily distributed throughout the Midwest and in limited quantities nationally. For roughly 2.00 more than the single bottle price I can pick up a six pack from the gas station across the street, how does it cost more than Y beer? I wasn't rude or arguing, but man, we got crap service from everyone the rest of the rest of the night. We were properly ignored for most of the show. I know she went to the back and told the other servers, we could see her pointing us out. I know you're paying for an experience, and other than the price gouged beers, it was a good show. We tipped before leaving despite being ignored and the hefty built in gratuity. ",

Since we were running errands together, I came along with him. He checked-in and the receptionist was polite towards him. He sat down next to me and this is where the trouble started.\n\nThe receptionist kept glaring at us. It wasn't just a casual look, it was a full-on [glare.](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--ZEA1ziKoxA/Uo18VEfNzkI/AAAAAAAAIU8/_jDx0eTDmAw/s1600/buffy+eyes.gif) At first we ignored it, then I got fed up with it and decided to take action.\n\nWhen she turned again her head to us to keep glaring, I piped up and asked her \"Hey! How is your day going so far!?\" and she just turned her head away without even replying.\n\nThis went on for the full fifteen minutes that we waited until my husband got called. After that she disappeared from the front desk. We he was done she came back, we paid and that was that.\n\nWe decided to complain because it made us pretty uncomfortable. We mentioned that everything was fine, but the fact that she glared made us feel uneasy, no biggie, right?  Just something to keep an eye on.\n\nThis is what the Director of Development replied:\n\n&gt; Hi *John*,\n\n&gt;My name is *Jon Johnson* and I am the Director of Business Development for the *-salon-* in the area. I wanted to follow up on your survey you left and apologize for your uncomfortable experience.\n\n&gt; *Mary*, is from the Philippines and is still learning some English. She is very kind and friendly but may not understand everything. We are working with her to learn these things. I am sure she did not mean you any ill will and was not aware of what she was doing. I will pass on your survey to the *-salon-* Manager so she can work with *Mary* on being more aware.\n\n&gt; Again, I apologize for your experience and I hope you will consider us again in the future.\n\n&gt; *Jon Johnson*\n\nIt's great that he replied but... Why the hell does he have to bring up her nationality and her English when we never even mentioned anything about her speaking the language or what she looked like? Not once in the survey did my husband mention anything aside from being uncomfortable due to staring/glaring. Also her English was accent-free and perfect, there was nothing wrong with it. \n\nI guess glaring is the kind of thing you can only do in English.\n\nWhile we found this fucked up in so many levels it also made us realize that almost always shitty management/direction= shitty service because of unhappy employees. \n\n**Edit**: We don't care about her nationality, it's irrelevant. We never brought it up. The Director excused her using her nationality, which honestly seems very shitty and inappropriate coming from a higher up. ",

The clerk goes into the back to fetch the items.*\n\n**Clerk 2** (turning to the customer with the toilet seat): Can I help you?\n\n**Customer:** Hi, you guys renovated my entire bathroom, but my toilet seat is loose.

As I take a step back I look at the clerk who clearly does not know how to react.*\n\n**Customer** (grabbing the shitty mechanism and twisting): See, no matter how long you turn it, the inside does not turn along. Here, you try.\n\n*He holds out the toilet seat to the clerk, but you can see he's not willing to touch it.*\n\n**Clerk2:** And what is the name and adress?

After 9 years he goes in to the shop to complain about his toilet seat being loose, demanding it be fixed under warranty and to prove his point he brought his toilet seat, but didn't bother cleaning of the sh*tstaines.*\n\n**Clerk2:** I'm sorry sir, that is far beyond the warranty.\n\n**Customer:** What? So I let you guys install a complete newly renovated bathroom and you can't even service my seat? That's pretty sh*tty customer service!\n\n*At this point, I audibly chuckle while Clerk1 rushes to the back holding back his laughter.*\n\n**Clerk2:** If you want I can make an offer for a new toilet, but installation will have to wait a few weeks since we are going on holiday next week.\n\n**Customer:** No, I will find someplace that does want to help me.\n\n**Clerk2:** Have a nice day sir.\n\n*At this point the customer storms out, hitting the door with the toilet seat that cause the lid to fall off. At this point I feel a hand on my shoulder. I don't know where she came from, but a very nice lady says \"excuse me\" and starts spraying everywhere and anything that came in contact with the seat while visibly gagging once in a while.*\n\n**Clerk2:** I'm going on a break.\n\n**Clerk1:** Be careful on the toilet!\n\n\n",

        "text": "Hi there. So this happened at a lovely local grocery store in Germany. There was one register open that had a very long line. Usually this means that a second register is about to be opened up, which makes some people linger around the second register in case it opens rather than standing behind that long line at the first register. \n\n\nIt's pretty common that people just form a line at the second register before it opens. If you're standing in line at the first register and you don't switch lines you obviously have to wait longer.\n\n\nThere was a young person lingering around the second register looking very carefully if an employee was about to open it up. I was standing in the general area and thinking the same thing. Wouldn't have made much sense to stand in the long line. The person lingering was from the middle-east I think. \n\n\nSo we stood there and soon enough a second cashier was called and was coming towards the register. The middle-eastern guy was first in line, then there was someone else, then there was I. An old guy (German guy) from the first line approached to be fourth in line and called out to the middle-eastern guy something like \"Here in the free west we wait in line! You can't just do anything you want!\" \n\n\nThe middle-eastern guy was confused when he realized that the old guy was talking to him. He was very young and polite, so he asked the old guy if he was in a hurry, he could go to the front of the line if he wanted. The old guy said something like \"No, *I* know how to wait in line, I don't break the rules like you do!\"\n\n\nSo the middle-eastern guy shook his head, the cashier was doing her work and the old guy said \"fu**ing foreigners!\". Since this is Germany, it's very not-okay for people to say something like that. My parents are Turkish and I look middle-eastern as well and as I was in line in front of him as well I couldn't help but be offended by that.\n\n\nUnfortunately, although I am usually witty and very intolerant when it comes to people like that, I literally froze up and couldn't believe what I just witnessed. A few minutes later (when I left the store) I was ready to put that asshole in his place. But I didn't. It was unbelievable. Yet another part of my faith in humanity was destroyed.\n\n\nTo clarify: the original order of the line from the first register doesn't apply to the second register. The old man took that idea as an excuse to bash a foreign looking person that was probably the son of a family that lived here many for years. He didn't even have an accent.",

        "text": "Rather than getting into my lurking habits, let's get straight to the point.\n\nSo there's three post offices in my town that I tend to use. The first one is the town's big, main branch, just about three minutes' drive from my house, and is usually fairly busy. The other is a smaller one in downtown, probably about 15 minutes away, that typically doesn't have a lot of people in it, so I don't have to wait in line much. And the third one is also about fifteen minutes away, but in a different direction [south], and also pretty much empty every time I go in. Because of how close it is, I usually opt to use the first, larger one. That's where my story from today takes place.\n\nI just sold a bunch of my old manga online and I went to the post office to send off the package. One of the boxes was rather large, containing thirteen books. As such, it was a bit heavy. Apparently, a little heavier than the prepaid shipping label indicated, by about a pound. Oops. The scale I weighed it on at home must've been calibrated wrong or something, it's an old scale.\n\nBut the lady at the desk got *pissed* about it. For the sake of painting a picture, she was an older Asian lady. Just so you can imagine the voice with which she snapped at me about the weight, asking me *why* the label said it was seven pounds, when it was actually eight, and then glaring at me. I was caught off-guard by her reaction, and I stumbled for an answer; I'm one of those people who's always low-key anxious, but things like this make the anxiety flare up. \n\nI eventually managed to stutter out my explanation about the scale [quietly because I was intimidated], and asked if it was possible to pay the difference for a label with the correct weight. Or *tried* to ask, because she cut me off, loudly asking if I planned to pay the difference or not. The whole time she's got this really sour look on her face, and I stumble more to say \"Yes, if I can, please. Thank you.\" Getting quieter with every word and fumbling to get my wallet out. My anxiety was skyrocketing. I wished she'd stop looking at me like I'd just insulted her. I really didn't mean anything by it. It was an accident, an honest mistake. I wasn't trying to cheat her or anything.\n\nAnd then she asked me what was in the package. \"Oh, it's just a bunch of books.\" I told her.\n\n\"Just books?\"\n\nI nodded. \"Just books.\"\n\nShe narrowed her eyes. \"No, it's not.\" She sounded like someone scolding a child. \"Not just books. What's in there?\" I repeated myself, stating that I was only sending books, a lot of books. She refused to believe me, and kept asking if it was *juuuuust books* and giving me this *look* whenever I stated again that yes, it was books. Then she says \"Because they're going to open it and inspect it, and if it's not *just books* they're going to throw it away. Garbage.\"\n\nUh. No. I...I don't think it's...I don't think they can just throw away my package like that. I mean, I don't know shit about the inner workings of the postal service, but I don't think they would just throw it away like that. At least I'd hope not.\n\nThe woman seemed less crabby with my other, smaller packages, but the damage was done at that point. I was nervous and more than a little upset from her raising her voice at me in front of the rest of the busy post office. It was embarrassing. All because of a mistake on a shipping label. I understand that I hadn't paid enough to ship the large package, but I think her reaction was overblown--*especially* accusing me of lying about what was in the box!\n\nHonestly, I don't think I ever want to go back to that particular post office again. This was kind of the last straw. Every other time I've been there, the people at the desk have been rude and dismissive. It was disheartening, but tolerable. But this was...I dunno. I just don't feel like it's worth it anymore. I think next time I'll just go to the downtown branch. They've always been okay to me. And the southern branch has really friendly people, so there's that, too.\n\nI really don't think I did anything wrong. I'm confused and still kind of upset and on edge since this just happened about an hour ago. I just wanted to ship some books, man.",

As I was proceeding to the checkout line (a zig-zagish line), I notice one of my co-workers from my store just about to go up to the register. As she gets called over, I lightly grab her shoulder and say, a bit loudly, 'hey, I was next in line'. She whips around and looked like she was about to blow a gasket until she recognized me, who was grinning from ear to ear barely containing my laughter. She was a good sport. The clerk said she was going to be like, 'NOPE. You two can work it out for yourselves'.\n\nShe was clearly next in line and there were 2-3 customers behind her, but everyone had a good laugh.",

        "text": "This happened about a year ago when my family and I were on vacation in Banff, Alberta. For those that are unfamiliar with Banff, it is a resort town located in the Province of Alberta (which is usually flooded by tourists all year round). \n\nWe went out one night to grab a bite to eat at a local restaurant downtown. It was particularly busy downtown because it was a Friday night, so we made a point to book a reservation at this restaurant. When we arrived, the restaurant was PACKED. We had to wait about 5 minutes to be seated with out reservation, no big deal. So my Mom, Dad, S/O and I get sat at a table for 4 people (this is important). So we order or drinks &amp; apps and are just sitting around talking while this group of 15 people (I assume a family on vacation) enters the restaurant. We were close to the entrance so I overheard the host explaining that it would be a 30 minute wait since they did not have a reservation. The group consisted of Asians, so I could not understand what they were discussing once the host told them about the wait. \n\nAt this time, I decided to go to the washroom and the strangest thing happened when I was walking back to our table. I was walking back and noticed the big group that walked in decided to sit wherever they pleased. Chaos ensued, as servers were running all over the restaurant trying to tell these people that they needed to wait to be seated. Some were sat at the bar, some were piling dirty dished on top of each other and sitting at tables that we're waiting to be bussed, and some were just standing beside people's tables waiting for them to finish their meal. It was absolute fuckery. But the cherry on top of the cake was when I returned to our table, surprised to see someone in my seat. The looks of confusion on my family's face was priceless. I'm like wtf (in my head) as my S/O tells me that they tried telling this man that this seat was taken, but he was having none of it (he obviously didn't understand English). This man saw me walk up to the table, and still didn't move so I decided to find somebody in the restaurant to help me out. Before I had the chance, this massive group started piling out of the restaurant and one of his friends/family members signalled him that they were leaving. He didn't even look at me, just got up and left the restaurant without saying a word. I was flabbergasted, but I just sat down at my seat and we all had a good laugh about it. Our waitress apologized for the confusion, but we said it wasn't her fault and left her an extra big tip since they had to herd these people out of their restaurant since they didn't make a reservation.\n\nA few from this group surprisingly stayed seated at the bar (I was surprised because they were polite enough to take a bar seat while waiting to be seated at a table).\n\nTLDR: Massive family walks into restaurant without reservation and starts seating themselves. In which I find one member of this group stole my seat while I went to the washroom.",

        "text": "So this didn't happen to me, but it happened to someone I know. Hope that's okay.\n\nThis person that this happened to is a runner, and they were about to do a long run (I forget how long exactly as this was quite a while ago). It was summer and he realised he didn't have any suncream, and since he was going to be outside running for a few hours (and because we live in England where the sun being out in full force is rare) he decided to nip into a shop to get some.\n\nAnyway, he finds the one he wants, goes up to the counter to pay and the cashier tells him that that particular product is part of a buy-one-get-one-free offer. Now, he has to carry this around with him for the whole run since he already checked his bag. I'm pretty sure he had a hydration pack or something, so he didn't have to hold it, but it would go in a pocket on the pack. In any case, it's extra weight that he didn't need or want, taking up extra room, but suncream is important so he didn't have much choice; it was either buy some, or burn.\n\nHe tells her that he knows about the offer but he only wants one because of carrying it around ect. but she won't let it go - \"But it's free. You don't have to pay for the second one. It's not costing anything more.\" - even after he explains that he doesn't have room for a second bottle even if he did want it, she's still trying to convince him.\n\nI can't believe we live in a society that's so hungry for free products that someone can't understand the concept of not taking a free item that you don't want. \"But it's free! You must want it!\" No. Sometimes, you don't.\n\nTL:DR; someone won't buy an item they don't want and cashier can't comprehend this because it's free and how can anyone turn down something that's free even if it will inconvenience them?",
