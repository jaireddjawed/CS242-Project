        "text": "Hello to anyone who takes the time to read this or help me in this journey!\n\nIn 2007 my father published a book through AuthorHouse. He had wanted to do this for as long as I could remember, and had my brother and I help type all of his written work up so that he could compile his poems into the book that was sent off to be published. \n\nHe was a self-employed contractor as he was writing his book, and when he finally decided to publish it the recession had begun to affect his business. The cost of materials were skyrocketing and people chose to be more conservative with their interior remodeling projects, so he was out of work very quickly. The last bit of money he had left, he sent off in hopes that his book would get published and he could make that his full-time career. It was a risky gamble, as he had three adolescent children; compounding this risk was that my youngest brother has an intellectual disability and epilepsy, so medical bills were constant for my parents. \n\nThis risk caused my family to start to suffer financially, caused my parents to fight even more than they had, and was the reason that spiraled my father into a state that led to his death seven years later. After he waited for weeks, months, and years to hear anything about his book- he eventually gave up. I genuinely mean this in the most literal interpretation. Over the subsequent seven years, he became incredibly depressed, was turned away by his father when my mother had kicked him out of our home, had been rejected by my two brothers due to the abuse they sustained at his hand, had no job, he had no money or desire to find a way to provide for his family, and his dreams had been crushed. \n\nMy father denied all medical advice, prescriptions, diagnoses, and treatments for the various medical issues he was suffering. My father turned into someone that I didn't recognize, which wasn't the first time in my life that this had happened. He became more feeble, more confused, more irritated. It was difficult to watch, and even harder to muster up the empathy needed to want to take care of him. I became the only one in my family that would take care of him though. I watched as a cocktail of untreated ailments took their toll on my father, and eventually he died in March of 2014. I was 24, and had no idea what to do. I thankfully had my mom, but not for too much longer as she passed in 2019. \n\nMy father, with all of his pitfalls and selfish choices, had an incredibly difficult life with only one dream that he never accomplished. I want to change that, even if it is posthumously. His book is listed on Amazon, but I don't know if I have rights to it or what I can do. I'm afraid to go straight to AuthorHouse because I've read heinous reviews about them and how they treat authors. Can anyone help me? Is there anything that I can do to get the publishing rights back or transferred to me? Any and all help would be appreciated! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: My dead dad wrote a book and I want to get the publishing rights for it but don't know how.",

A couple of weeks ago, I finished Brave New World, which I had to be in high school. At the time, I remember feeling like it was very adult. On the re-read, it was not much like what I remembered at all, and really didn’t like it at all. I just finished reading one of my childhood faves, Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH. Rereading it took me back and I was surprised how vivid and spot on my memory was. Great book that still holds up well. Glad I reread it, and today, I just learned that there were essentially two sequels written by his daughter. Never knew that. Now I’m curious what other gems people rediscover as an adult.",

Him cradling Rogozhin in the finale after Rogozhin murders Nastasya and leads him to view the body was brutal. Honestly Myshkin is too pure for his own good and by the ending he truly becomes \"The Idiot\" through his series of actions.\n\nIve read \"Crime and Punishment\", \"Notes from the Underground\" and \"The Idiot\" of Dostoevsky's work, eventually looking to tackle \"The Brothers Karamazov.\" I honestly view this at least as good as \"Crime and Punishment\" in terms of quality and enjoyment.

And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.\"\n\nWhile I'm not wanting to ignite a discussion specifically about Penguin changing the words of Roald Dahl's books, is it fair to link 'reviews' (i.e. amendments) to books by publishers to 'ensure that it can continue to be enjoyed by all today' to the practices of Orwell's 'Ministry of Truth'?\n\n(Of course the 'Ministry of Truth' is fictitious, and Penguin and other publishers are not guilty of all out Orwellian practices, but personally I can't ignore their similarity in light of the recent events).",

It’s not only this book, a lot of booktube suggestions have been falling flat for me… The backstory is that I was an avid reader in my late teens and all through my 20s and while I did keep reading, definitely fell off for a while… I’ve recently gotten back into it in a big way, but so much just isn’t hitting the way things did when I was young.\n\nThe science fiction aspects were so surface level, the characters so one dimensional…. One of the bigger reveals was obvious within 20 pages. Am I just cranky? Is it because most of book tube are on the young side?

        "text": "I read Bunny last fall and absolutely loved it. Dark comedy meets magical realism with very real and flawed characters and an unreliable narrator is totally up my alley. I'm now in a book club and have been wanting my book choice to be this type of book because I know it's very different than what the other women in the group typically read. I'm wondering how others have found All's Well, especially as it compares to Bunny and books of the like. I'd also just love other suggestions in this type of storytelling because I find it very compelling.\n\nOther books that fit this \"type\" that I have enjoyed to various degrees\n\n\\-Boy Parts by Eliza Clark\n\n\\-The Pisces and Milk Fed by Melissa Broder\n\n\\-Nightbitch by Rachel Yoder\n\n\\-I'm Thinking of Ending Things by Iain Reid\n\nAny suggestions helps a lot :)",

I lost this passion throughout my teens and young adulthood but am actively trying to pick it up as a hobby again because I do love it, just harder to find the time now.\n\nI’ve just finished a book where I was dragging myself through to the end, I was so frustrated with how the book was written and the ending. It’s a book that’s part of a series and I loved the other ones, just bitterly disappointed in this one. The only reason I finished it was because I wanted to check it off my ‘to read’ list. And now I have I feel like I wasted my time. \n\nObviously I know some books are going to be better than others and it’s also down to personal taste but I’m so grumpy I spent hours reading a book I thought was rubbish by the end.\n\nHow do you move onto the next book without the fear you’ll also dislike it?",

Coming to you all for help. \n\nI shoot street fashion in NYC. I take candid photos from a distance of people going about their everyday life. I get permission from every person after the photo is taken if I can share the image. I often times will conduct a quick interview asking about the clothes, style and the person as well. This started turning into more about the people which was a nice surprise. \n\nThe book will be a photography book compiled of images I have taken over the years, some of my musings about the BTS of a photograph and some very quick small interviews of the subject.\n\nSo I am looking for cover ideas. I like simple designs. Wondering if you all have any insight into the importance of a book cover and binding. Any and all advice is happily welcomed. \n\nThanks in advance.",

But Mistborn the differences are stark. The plot is not different but entire sections are written differently. These changes are not changes to what happens but just how it is written and the syntax of sentences and paragraphs. How common is this? I assume the audio was made based on an original edition and then changes were made to the book. Why was the book rewritten like this? Is this something Sanderson does or an editor? It’s just confusing to me and makes it difficult to listen and read together. It’s doable, but I’m mostly just curious about the process of something like this.",
