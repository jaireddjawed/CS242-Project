I am looking for things at a ground level that if you were to design a metro right now -  would need to be incorporated, such as ability to travel not only into and out of the city, but around the city. In Boston it is well known that you have to \"get in to get out\" meaning you have to head downtown switch to a different line and then travel back out towards the area you want to head to. Obviously this is not ideal.\n\nI would also love links to good reads.\n\nThanks all!",

AVs are a tool. We humans have to decide if and how we want to use them.  \n\nThis\\^  I get so nervous about the rise of AVs.  The damage that the introduction of mass automobility caused to our cities was not an inexorable result of the technology but of bad choices we made to accommodate that technology to the exclusion of other modes.  A minority urban-enthusiasts seem to understand that mistake but I believe most people -- particularly policymakers -- either don't see it or don't care.

A solution to this is changing development to a more people focused mixed-use design. We are starting to see these shifts in development with urban infill and master planned neighborhoods. However, outside of new construction and further development is there something we can do to improve the current supply? Construction is expensive and takes a long time - generally it can't keep up with demand. Furthermore, it's quite a lot to ask of populations to just pick up their lives and move. I think we will see major population shifts back to higher density mixed use development but that will likely take decades. What do we do in the mean time? Can we provide temporary solutions to existing development that sequesters the issues that arise with single use zoning?\n\nMy thoughts: road diets and complete street design are a good place to start",

They approach the subject with somewhat of an utopist stance.\n\nI want to gift them something nice but I'm not quite sure what. I had hoped that I would find something like an art book full of illustrations and photographs. Surely, the 20th century must have been full of attempts to create 'utopist' urban environments that are by now historical, I thought. But I didn't manage to find anything nice in print. \n\nIn the absence of visual works on urban planning, I think an art book on utopian architecture would also be cool, if that exists. A compilation maybe of works about things like [Ponte City](https://explorepartsunknown.com/south-africa/south-africas-tower-of-dreams/). Maybe even modernist and brutalist architecture, if the link to utopian urban planning is made strongly.\n\nIf there aren't any good books/artbooks, I'd also gladly gift a print or other piece of art if anyone knows something good.\n\nAny ideas?

On the lower end of that spectrum you'd need it to be a university town of course, like Cambridge, Lund, etc. Though I have no data to support this however. \n\nThankful for all kinds of input you might have!\n\n-teodor",

Most residents seem to be against it. It's supposed to add about 2900 homes and seems like it would really mess up our traffic. What do you guys think?",
