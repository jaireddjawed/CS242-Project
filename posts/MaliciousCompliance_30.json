        "text": "Long ago while in grad school I worked at a big box electronics store doing a commissioned sales gig. The job wasn't all that bad, but as with all big box retailers they really wanted you to push their lame personal service contracts which was their fancy word for an extended store warranty. \"Where da real money is made!\" as they say.\n\nThis place was a way for me to make money on the side while finishing the last leg of school, so I didn't bother with the warranties all that much. I'd mention them, they were good money, but I wasn't pushy with customers. Then a perfect storm hit that allowed me to not only make some money, but a shitload of money, all while having some fun at the store's expense.\n\nPerfect storm ingredient 1: Management started heavily hinting that they were going to start writing up salespeople if they didn't start selling X amount of warranties per week and getting X amount of people to sign up for their useless store credit card.\n\nPerfect storm ingredient 2: This store had a generic low price \"store brand\" of networking hardware. Well it turns out the company's buyer and some other management people had taken massive kickbacks from this low price brand to keep them in the store which resulted in a shitstorm from on high. The buyer and anyone else in on the scandal was fired. In addition prices were slashed and commissions were raised to get this brand out of the store as fast as possible.\n\nSo thinking about my new weekly goal and wanting to be a good customer, I started selling warranties more aggressively with the following speech to customers:\n\n\"So I know you haven't heard of this brand compared to your Netgears and your Linksys, but think of it like this. You can buy this router that does the same job for $20, get a $10 warranty, save $40 because they're having a fire sale, and if it craps out then you come back and they have to replace it. The real beauty is they're getting rid of this line so they have to replace it with the next best competitor which means you get a full price brand name item for the $10 it cost you for the warranty.\"\n\nSurprisingly a lot of people saw the logic of this and bought their fire sale tech along with a warranty that often cost as much as the item being sold. Eventually my boss, who was a pretty cool guy, called me over to ask why my warranty numbers were suddenly so high. I liked the guy so I explained exactly what I was doing. He stared for a moment, then said \"you shouldn't be selling a $10 warranty on a $10 item we're discontinuing.\"\n\nI explained I was just following upper management's orders. Everyone hated upper management so he just smiled and shook his head. I kept right on selling warranties until the fire sale was over and had some of the best weekly commission numbers I ever got at that store thanks to the fire sale commission prices and the added warranties.\n\nThe real kicker? The store manager who'd threatened writing people up if they didn't hit warranty targets came over a couple of times to congratulate me on all the great work I was doing. She could see the numbers, but apparently my boss forgot to mention to her why that number suddenly spiked.",

        "text": "This is a story that’s somewhat legendary around my minesite that I work at, and I think it belongs here (skip down if you don’t feel like reading):\n\nOne of the big bosses (we’ll call him BB) around the site decided to be a smart ass one day, and instructed someone a level below him (we’ll call him AA) to save the mine $34 Million a year. Here’s what’s important, BB said didn’t care how he did it, he told AA to just get it done or else he’d make sure they’d lose their job. \n\nNow AA had been putting up with shit from this BB for the past few months. There’s a code of conduct and responsibility that needs to be followed and BB worked very hard to find his way through every loophole possible that stopped him from slacking off. \n\nThis includes dumping a fair amount of extra work into his employees, but the one in this tale of ProRevenge had it the worst. BB would constantly belittle AA on the mine radios, dump extra paperwork on him (including BB’s own paperwork), make him drive other employees around the minesite when AA was already swamped with the extra paperwork causing him to lag behind in his other duties that he was SUPPOSED to be doing. AA was no assistant, it was not his job to do BB’s shit, and if he refused BB technically could start the process of AA’s termination through some bullshit loophole. \n\n•Skip to here if you don’t feel like reading•\n\nSo here’s where it gets interesting. After BB instructed AA to save the mine $34 a year, AA figured out damn well that BB was trying to kiss the ass of the higher ups and make himself look good. However instead of doing the work himself, he has once again dumped it onto AA. And AA had had enough.\n\nBB has his designated time off and comes back to find a massive (and I mean MASSIVE, this thing is one of the biggest production movers on site) conveyor line parked up miles away from where it is supposed to be operating and in the equipment graveyard. If you haven’t seen a conveyor line, think if a crane and a conveyor belt had an enormous love child. It has been disassembled and sits in three enormous pieces. \n\nBB flies off of the handle. He explodes, he gets onto the mine radios and screams for AA to get his ass down there. AA rocks up, and when asked what in hell he’d done, AA simply shrugs and says “I’ve pulled the conveyor out of production. It saves you $34 million a year.” \n\nNo matter what BB argued or how much he threatened, AA simply said “you told me to save $34 million a year. I did just that.” No matter how much money the mine would actually LOOSE with this massive machine out of construction, AA did as he was told.\n\nOf course the big BIG bosses found out, and when they questioned BB about it he pointed to blame to AA. Once again, AA stood his ground and said that he was did as he was told. Once BB confirmed what he had instructed AA to do it wasn’t long before BB was sacked. He packed his stuff and walked out of the gate that same day. AA still happily remains, stress free and not to be fucked with. \n",

He also started lots of drama in the workplace, and was genuinely everyone’s least favorite person to be scheduled with.  He quit because he was apparently tired of all of the drama but he caused it all. \n\nHe was super lazy, and always used the fact he had seniority to do nothing. He wouldn’t touch the dishes, he refused to prep certain food items, stay on the register all night instead of assisting with making customers orders, and sometimes even flat out refuse to get off his phone and help make sandwiches. (note that there’s usually only 2 people scheduled bc we aren’t a busy store, so when he refused it would be one person making food) \n\nWhenever someone would question it or accuse him of being lazy, he’d just say that he’s been here longer so he gets to tell them what to do and they can’t do anything about it. \n\nI told my manager about his behavior after he quit and she said I should’ve snuck off to the bathroom to call her so she could give him the proper punishment. \n\nAfter he quit, two days later I was working night shift. 10 minutes before closing, an online order comes through which is really annoying for obvious reasons. it was 2 sandwiches. I noticed the name on the order was his best friend’s. one of the sandwiches ordered seemed a lot like something he’d order. It makes sense that he’d put in an order so late because he knows it would piss off whoever was working and he hates all of us. \n\nWhen looking at the order, I noticed he had lots of special requests like extra banana peppers and light lettuce. Since I knew it was most likely his sandwich I decided to have a little fun. Instead of spitting is food or sneaking in a jalapeño, I put 3 pieces of shredded lettuce on his sandwich and put enough banana peppers on his sandwich to keep it from being able to close all the way. I also wrapped his sandwich up loosely because he would always give me shit for doing that. \n\nHe came in and picked it up with a smug look on his face. I felt safe because I knew he wouldn’t have to balls to call and complain because management hates him so even if he did I wouldn’t receive punishment.  \n\n\n \n\n\n",

        "text": "FTP! LTL!\n\nTL:DR:  Man owed 5 cents on an old loan. Bank auto-generated a loan offer to ‘lock in’ a rate on said loan, man tried to explain this to bank and was cut off rudely. Man proceeds to waste banks time and effort year after year renegotiating terms for interest on a loan he only owes five cents on, costing the bank far more time in labor than the loan is worth to them. \\[thanks to u/GandhiOwnsYou\\]\n\nThis isn't my story but was told by a friend and thought you might enjoy it.\n\nBackstory:\n\nThe story took place a several years ago over a time span of 6 years. A decade ago it was possible to get a mortgage in my country where you loan a amount of euros and only pay interest over, you don't have to redeem it for a 30 year period. Due to stricter regulations the government changed it to lower the mortgage debt of our country.\n\nAt the time my friend needed to upgrade his house and got such a mortgage, because your monthly expenses for them are quite low due to only paying interest.\n\nMy friend is a smart man and is good in personal finance and he doesn't like BIG BANKs in particular. He finds them bureaucratic giants with no soul and feeling for the small man. After the house was done he started to aggressively pay back the loan.\n\nThe loan was shrinking hard and after a while he got a notification it was fully paid off. He was a happy man afterwards, thinking he would no longer have to deal with BIG BANK. The second mortgage was paid off or so he tought.\n\nThe fixed interest period on his primary mortgage was ending and he got a offer from BIG BANK to fix it for a new period. Next to the offer for the primary mortgage there was a offer for the second paid of mortgage. They checked the letter of this mortgage and found out there still was 0.05 cents left in the second mortgage. This letter was a official offer which came by official post including instruction letter, marked return envelope etc. \n\nA long process of calling the BIG BANK ensues and he finally got the right department within BIG BANK or so he thought. He got a financial adviser which wanted to discuss the very great offer BIG BANK provided for them.\n\nThe adviser was not really the brightest person and kept pushing about the primary mortgage deal. My friend who said it was not about the primary mortgage but about the second mortgage was shut off right away. Adviser told about the great offer the bank made and how BIG BANK doesn't make mistakes very often.\n\nAfter a few attempts he just nodded along and wanted the conversation to be over. He \"thanked\" the adviser for his time, and the adviser just clearly stated one last time they really should consider the offer BIG BANK made.\n\nAnd so he did.\n\nHe scheduled a meeting with his wife and he was nominated president for the meeting. They went over the offer and discussed how long they should fix the interest period. Calculated different scenarios in excel and finally went for the 1 year extension. Hoping the bank would find out about the mortgage and terminate it due to only costing the bank money (due to processing fees, postal cost etc.).\n\nThey bank never did anything and so they decided to continue for another year and schedule another meeting.\n\nThey even invited friends over to discuss the offer. And within the third year the meeting became a practical joke between friends, they just started to look forward to the annual meeting. Because for them it was a fun night out and a good excuse to have a BBQ with each other.\n\nAfter a \"heavy\" debate they still would go for a one year extension, knowing this would cost the bank money to renew and provide a new offer each year. \n\nThe story was concluded when the bank put in a rule where you started to pay a service fee for the bank account if it has small amount on it. The service fee would be 12 euro a year.\n\nAt the 6th annual meeting, a board of 12 decided the loan must be terminated because the 240 times increase in interest could not be justified.\n\nAlthough not a big story with a lot of damage, I found it quite amusing!\n\nEdit: TL:DR according u/GandhiOwnsYou write up from comments. Apologies if the story is not clear, english is not my first language and writing is not really my strenght.",

Just do it.\" \nMe: \"Ok I'll just send you some information so you can do it later. \" \nCustomer \"fine fine,whatever.\" \nSo I check and these purchases do qualify according to their information and no other refunds of this nature have been done on their account before. So I can make an exception,refund  these purchases and just these purchases. I saw other purchases that might qualify but it's not my job to guess what the customer wants. I can only do what they ask me to do. Or in this case TELL me to do. And I follow company policy and refund the purchases.  I ask if there's anything else they say no and just hangs up. I of course had noted all of this in my notes. Turned into a paragraph at that point.  So they got refunded for 2 purchases. BUT there where at least a dozen more they wouldn't let me tell them about because THEY where in a HURRY. Of the same type of refund that they could have just lumped into as one giant refund.I figure they are going to regret their decision in their haste. So hey when a customer service who deals with your money tries to help, let them.\nEdited to fix some errors.",

        "text": " A friend and I worked in a cafe at a university.  We were the last place to close in the food court so naturally everyone rushed to get food just before closing.  We usually started our close routine about 15 minutes before closing to avoid staying late.  One school year we got a new manager who came from a better school, we knew this because he told everyone this all the time.  So he started a new policy, anyone who came through the gate just after close could stay and wander around looking at the closed stations until they finally realized that we were the only ones opened. So we were making meals past close and delaying or re-starting our close routine almost every night.  It pissed off my co-workers because leaving 5 minutes later meant a difference in 30 minutes for catching their buses.  So, we started working slow, instead of using a thawed burger, we'd put a frozen one down which took longer, we'd prep fresh condiments instead of using what was on hand. Basically, we gave the same service, just really slow.  It took a few days for the manager to catch on.  He had to turn the lights out, lock up etc so he couldn't leave until we were done, he realized that he was leaving 30+ minutes after close as well.  He changed the policy back to no admittance after closing. ",

        "text": "Greetings! This story is from a few months ago in my local school Choir. Let's dive right into it.\n\nThe players are:\nMr. B: The choir director. Outstanding guy but very hesitant.\n\nMark: Tenor section leader. Funny guy, respectable, very skilled.\n\nSteve: Bass section leader. Very chill and relaxed but still respectable. Very very skilled.\n\nCass: The resident bitch-face of any group, and this story's compliee.\n\nSandra: Cass's friend, a fairly silent but well-liked girl.\n\n\nContext:\n\nMark and Steve are two of the four section leaders, and both are wonderful people. I can't really put it into words. They're talented and know how to control their section. It's exactly what you want in a section leader. Each section leader is in charge of a section of the choir, arranged by voice part. In this case, tenors are the guys who sing pretty high, and basses are the guys who sing pretty low. Steven and Mark are both well decorated singers in their respective voice part, where Steven has even received state acknowledgement in the form of a 2nd chair placement in the official State Choir. They're also both huge nerds.\n\nThink of our choir as sort of a corrupt government. Mr. B is extremely passive and favors non-action, but all of the section leaders are a group of tight-knit friends who have a lot of say in the actions of the choir. It's not a perfect system, but the section leaders are voted in at the start of the year and tend to be well-liked and levelheaded people. They don't technically have any real power, but the director is always open to persuasion, and nothing ticks him off more than students who don't participate. Speaking of which, let's introduce the last star player.\n\nCass is a standard bitch-face. She wears a soccer jersey but is bad at sports, is a makeup guru with the wrong foundation color, and has that \"can i speak to your manager\" haircut. It's been several months since this story and I still can't tell if Cass is genuinely interested in choir. She spends most of rehearsal complaining but doesn't offer any solutions, and any after-school rehearsals result in either her not showing up, or showing up but not participating.\n\nI should also add that Cass is an Alto. Each section of the choir is placed on a different spot in the performance layout. Cass is on the opposite side of the layout as her friend, Sandra, whom is a Soprano.\n\n\nThe issue:\n\nThe big concert competition is a week away, followed by a home concert starring those songs shortly afterward. Mr. B has wrestled away the auditorium from the school band and theatre programs for that whole week in order to practice in the correct layout. There are two after-school practices. The Tuesday and Thursday rehearsals. This event takes place on the Thursday rehearsal.\n\nIt's no secret that Cass doesn't like what we've been practicing. When asked, she'll talk about how much the songs \"suck\" and how \"they're terrible\" but not why they're terrible. So it was no surprise to everyone that Cass walked in late to the Thursday rehearsal and then took her spot at the Sorpano section in the middle of the first song. Mr B didn't take notice, but the Tenor section certainly did. When we cycled off the stage so that the girls could sing a song alone, there was lots of quiet chatter about Cass. Why is she in the wrong spot? Why is she talking with Sandra between songs? Etc etc.\n\nMark, Steve and I were all sitting and listening to the girls sing. When we came on stage afterward and sang the guy only songs, a similar thing happened. None of us minded. But Cass seemed to take personal offence to the fact that we were talking during her beautiful song (which she wasn't even singing, mind you!). After the guys sang, we all reconvened on stage while Mr. B went to grab sound equipment for some soloists in the final song. Cass angrily marched up to Mark and Steve, whom were in close proximity of each other, and began practically yelling at them. It was hard not to hear her. The conversation went something like this.\n\nCass: \"How could you sit and critique my song while yours are terrible?\"\n\nMark: \"???\"\n\nCass: \"You sat out there and nitpicked our songs and then came up here and choked! You sounded like a dying cat!\"\n\nSteve: \"Cass, go back to your section.\"\n\nCass: \"No, I demand you tell me what you were saying, dipshit!\"\n\nIt was at this point it was obvious that Mark was growing sick of Cass's shit. Cass was personally insulting Steve and the integrity of the choir. What follows is not what we were talking about. I don't even think we were talking.\n\nMark: \"We were talking about how you were sitting down between songs, in the wrong section of the choir, and chatting with Sandra while you were on stage.\"\n\nCass: \"Bullshit, I...\"\n\nMark: \"You do not get to act entitled to anything, because you are not. You have been consistently lazy over the past weeks, between not showing up to rehearsals, talking over Mr. B, and now insulting Steve. I will not let this fly. Go back over to the correct section or I will personally push for your removal from the choir.\"\n\nCass: \"You can't do that.\"\n\nMark: \"Yes I can, I have proof.\"\n\nCass: \"Show me, pussy.\"\n\nA smile spread across Mark's face as he pulled his phone out of his pocket. Steve went to go fetch the Alto section leader, and Mark opened his photo app.\n\n\"This is an album of different instances in the last 4 days of you not participating in class. What should we start with, the 3 minute video of you not singing [song 1], the 2 minute video of you sitting down during [song 2], the pictures of you talking to Sandra in the middle of [song 1 on a different day], or Tuesday's attendance log where you didn't even show up?\"\n\nCass's jaw practically dropped. Her face turned a bright red as she knew this was over. With a valiant \"fuck off\" she retreated to the alto section. No punishment ever came, but Mark did and still does have those recordings and pictures. It would be hard to remove her, but even she knows it was possible. And that was enough for the rest of the year, because Cass straightened herself up. Sandra stopped hanging out with Cass and started hanging out with the section leaders and I for an unrelated reason. Last I heard, Cass's last friend moved across the country.\n\nI really hope this is good Malicious Compliance, and either way it's a story that I've really wanted to tell. Mark kept his cool and told Cass what we all wanted to tell her, and she was placed in check. His actions may not have been ethical but I stand by them as the best method at the time.\n\nTLDR; Bitchface acts entitled, gets called out, asks for proof and gets fucking served.\n\nedit: formatting",

        "text": "I’ve been lurking in this sub for a while and just today remembered that I do, in fact, have a story to contribute. \n\nI teach high school English, and I have to (reluctantly) learn at least a little bit of teenage slang every year just to keep up. I generally try to have fun with it, though. Definitely it worked in my favor when I learned that “lit” meant good, so for about a week I could enthusiastically start off class while holding up a novel and shout, “Guys, look, it’s LIT (*as in LITERATURE*)!” Cue teenage groans, amp up cheesy smile, fun times. \n\nSo, this past year, one of my students’ most favorite colloquialisms turned out to be “BET,” typically said in exclamation (!!!) in response to someone’s exaggerated brag or foolish claim. Over time, I learned that it was essentially a dare, as in, “I *dare* you to follow up on/prove that statement you just so confidently made.” (I mean, I know what the word *means*, but I hadn't heard it so frequently in this context.)\n\nAbout halfway through the year, in one of my morning classes, a particularly enthusiastic gentleman decided that he would utilize the word as often as possible in response to my normal instructions, essentially rendering them redundant. So, class would proceed in this fashion: \n\n&gt;\"Okay, guys, take out your textbooks and flip to chapter 3.\" *BET*.\" Yes…yes, I bet you will do that. You should definitely do that. Okay…\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Now, let’s turn to our notes on this subject.\" *BET*. \"Yeah, yeah, let’s bet on that. You bet that’s a good idea.\"   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Poe’s a pretty messed up dude. We’re going to talk about some of his background here in just a sec.\" *BET*. \"Okay…okay, yes. Yes, I do think we are going to do that. Okay? Yes, I bet so.\" \n\nTo be clear, this wasn’t happening in every class, every day, every time I spoke, but it was happening *juuuust* often enough to be slightly obnoxious. I could have formally disciplined him, I suppose, but he was an otherwise good kid. And, to be honest, his responses were so deadpan and quirky enough to kind of be amusing that I didn’t think it warranted any real response. \n\nOne December day we’re in the middle of *Brave New World.* I’m giving them fair warning that a pop quiz is coming up (on a chapter they are supposed to have already read) because I know the little…precious angels...haven’t been reading, so I’m trying to motivate them with some good old fashioned fear. I end up saying something like the following: \n\n&gt;“What I need you to realize here, guys, is that a pop quiz is coming over chapter *blah blah*. This is your fair warning, okay? You won’t know when…you won’t know how…you might not even know why…but a pop quiz will be happening.” \n\nSo, the only way I can explain this next part is that the kid just wasn’t thinking. I guess that just having said it over and over so many times, he was driving on autopilot. And with his eyes glazed over and his perfect deadpan voice, he said the word that had annoyed me so many times before: \n\n&gt;**“BET.”** \n\nOf course, he immediately realized his mistake. But, it was oh so late. \n\nI smiled. Angels sang. Bird chirped. Proverbial fucking choirs rang out as I said:\n\n&gt;**“BET RIGHT.”**\n\nAnd I gave them a pop quiz. \n\nNow, if the story ends there, I’m kind of just a dick of a teacher. And to be honest, there’s a part of me that wanted to just let them all fail to maybe (*juuuust* maybe) push them to read a little more. The problem is that they would have ended up blaming that one kid, who was visibly not having a great day at that point, and since I had been okay with him using this little joke so far in class, that really wouldn’t have been cool. I'm making the whole thing up on the spot, btw, and they're writing on their own paper. So, while the first few questions I make up for the quiz pertain to the book, the questions later on get…a little more interesting. \"Who would win in a fight: Spiderman or Batman?\" \"Why is the sky blue and not umber?\" \"Why is *Twilight* a stupid book (and there ARE wrong answers here)?\" Ultimately, the kids pick up on the fact that I’m not going to fail them all, *at least not yet*, and we have a few laughs over it. Quizzes become paper balls in the recycling bin, and we move on. \n\nThe kid does start betting me far less often in class, which is nice, and the kids always want “weird” questions on quizzes from then on. \n\nTL;DR: Kid bets me to give the class a quiz. I do. ",

        "text": "This happened yesterday. I work front end at a grocery in the northeast that, according to legend, never mops. Just look at their floors. It's 5:30, and Customer Service lead is done with her shift, so she leaves me her override number, which is a three digit code and a four digit password that allows CSLs/Managers to access functions of the register that regular employees can't access, like voiding large amounts of items, taking certain coupons, among other things. The CSLs are pretty liberal about giving out overrides, especially to me, because I've worked there for nearly 5 years and have repeatedly proven my trustworthiness.\n\nThe CSL leaves, and the next one isn't scheduled for a half hour. Five minutes later I have to do an override, but it turns out the CSL gave me the wrong number. No big deal, I'll just ask the girl working the service desk for hers. Her name, for the sake of our story, is Ashley.\n\nAshley is one of those people who thinks that she's friends with everyone and that everyone likes her, and as a result of that thinks it's ok to condescend to everyone, even people who are more senior than her. (Like me.) She's also dumber than a box of rocks. So when I ask her for her override number, she says that she won't give it to me, but she'll come out and do the override. I'm about to protest, but I realize what she's suggesting and I agree.\n\nOut she comes from behind the service desk, walks over to the registers (a reasonable distance away), does the override, and makes her way behind the service counter. Two minutes later, another override. Again, out from behind the service desk, walks over to the registers, does the override, heads back. This happens seven or eight more times in the space of a half hour, and since she's constantly going back and forth, she has quite a line at the service desk. The cashiers are also getting backed up, because they have to wait for her overrides. \n\nThe first thing the CSL asks when he arrives is why the lines are so long, since it's not a peak hour for us. I tell him exactly what happens, and he gives me his override number and says if she ever pulls that shit again to go ahead and use his. He then has to go help Ashley behind the service desk, because the lines are so long.\n\nPlay stupid games, Ashley, win stupid prizes.",

        "text": "I have been fighting this forever and a day, but a while back I was given the ultimatum to find a metric to grade my tech support crew on or they would find a metric. \n\nI banged my head around trying to find the most useless metric that would lead to only those truly deserving of the boot to get it. \n\nI found it. Average time spent on calls. For those unaware of the corporate level phone tech support, very few calls reach the level of what you would consider long or excessive. \n\nMost calls are 5-7 minutes and are resolved with very few people coming back with the same issues. The average time selected was 20 minutes. This means that unless a phone call goes over an hour, you literally cant go above an average time of 20 minutes. \n\nThis lasted all of 2 weeks when the management decided to add an extra stipulation in. Any call going over 30 minutes has to be recorded and collated down for review. \n\nIn a week we had our first offender... if you can call it that. A tech was working on an issue and had to go to lunch so I had another tech take the call. While the issue was being resolved, a new one cropped up. This made the call go over 30 minutes, but no one knew it. \n\nThe first tech worked the call for 20 minutes and just about had it fixed when he left for lunch. The second call had the original issue fixed in 2 minutes, however the second issue that cropped up caused him to be on the call for 20 more minutes. Total time on the call was 43 minutes. Neither tech went over the 30 minute mark, but the second tech got dinged. \n\nI got a call from an exec wanting to talk about the first offender. They linked the call log and asked me about it. I informed them that neither tech went over 30 minutes so he should not even be seeing this log. He told me that the customer was on the phone for 43 minutes and that it did not matter which tech did what. He was going to put this on the record of the second tech who worked the call. \n\nAfter that, I said no more. I was done. \n\nI called an impromptu meeting of the IT support team and gave them all the lowdown of it without getting into specifics. The looks on everyones faces shifted from disgust and anger to laughter when I told them my solution. \n\nNo phone call, no matter what, is to go above 25 minutes. If you have to hang up and call the customer back, then you do it. That was when one of the workers had a better idea. \"Why not just make it as close to 30 minutes as humanly possible? Ending our calls at 29:59 if we can?\" \n\nMy response was to direct people to do that. They will not have calls go over 29:59 no matter what. If upper management had an issue, they could come to me. \n\nSo from then on we had every user terminating calls at 29:57-59 seconds every single time. If the issue wasnt solved, we would call immediately back. ",

I receive metal forgings and machine them for use in oil and gas pipelines.  These specific forgings are used in the manufacture of several different parts (relevant) and are rather expensive.   \n\n\nOne day I received a batch of forgings that were out of spec.  If I were to machine them, the result would be a part that is out of spec and not fit for use.  (An angularity issue for those in manufacturing that are curious.)  And in a pressurized pipeline, out of spec parts can have serious consequences.  I went to my boss and told him that the forgings are out of spec and that I can't run them for this part.  Since the forgings are so expensive, I can save them for another part where the specs are not as critical.\n\nBoss: How do you know the forgings are out of spec?\n\nMe:  I measured them.\n\nBoss:  How did you measure them?\n\nMe:  With a protractor.

I explained the forgings were out of spec.  They want to know why the forgings weren't saved for another job.  I explained Boss's command to run them anyway.

        "text": "This happened on a multi-use trail along a canal that I frequent, both by bicycle and on  foot.   On this particular day, I was riding my bike, and the trail was kind of a mess. We'd had a lot of rain and the path had flooded, so whole sections had turned into mud puddles.  Where I live, trail etiquette says that cyclists yield to everyone, and pass on the left while giving a verbal warning or ringing a bike bell.  I've had encounters with asshole cyclists so I always follow these rules.  And on this day I'm being particularly careful navigating the muddy trail and slowing down so as to not splash people.\n\nNow, most people are pretty courteous and move to the side when they hear a bike approach, and a handful are oblivious or just jerks about it. And sure enough, on the last mile of my ride, I come across a pair of jerks. This couple was walking part of the path where the left side was quite muddy and there was a puddle covering a little less than half the width of the trail. I ring my bell and slow down as I approach.  I'm hoping they'll move over a bit so I don't have to ride through the puddle, but I'm already splashed with mud so no big deal if they don't. Instead, both of them turn around and scowl at me and one yells \"Don't make so much noise!\", before turning back around and continuing to take up the same amount of space.\n\nFor some reason, this pissed me off much more than normal. So I decided to be a jerk right back at them and do exactly what they asked - I didn't say a word or touch my bell again, stopped decreasing my speed and plowed straight through the puddle, sending up a nice little splash onto their shoes before continuing in my merry way.\n\nTL;DR - Got yelled at for warning pedestrians of my approach, silently rode through a puddle and splashed them.",

        "text": "I am a vendor at a big box retail store with a buy and best in the name. My job is to show off and demo a specific product. We are suppose to build a good relationship with the managers and employees. I am also suppose to train the employees so that they know the product in case I am not at the store or available.\n\nTo develop these relationships, you need to talk to them, right? So that is what I do. When the store is slow, I talk with the employees and get to know them, as well as training on my product. But management doesn't like that at all. So the manager on duty (MOD) comes to talk to me.\n\nMOD: Why are you talking to my employees and distracting them from work?\nMe: I was just building our relationship and training them on my product.\nMOD: Sure sure. But don't do it when customers are around.\nMe: There are 3 times as many employees as customers i-\nMOD: Don't Tell me how many customers are in MY store! Who do you think you are?\nMe: Well I-\nMOD: Don't speak to any employees in this store anymore and do only your job. We are sick of your distractions! Now, go back to your area and stay there.\n\nI went back to my area and called my manager to let him know what happened and tell him I would comply and they would pay for it. He laughed and thought that compliance was a great idea, but told me that when they apologize, then help again. I agreed.\n\nFor the past couple weeks, I stayed in my area and didn't speak to any employees. Since managers are employees, I don't speak to them either. This is quite problematic for them because only I have the key to this particular product and all of the stock of it. It has cost the store around ~$150k in sales so far. No apology yet, but I could tell they are starting to hurt.\n\nWell, corporate caught wind of their bullshit (I think from my organization since we file reports to their corporate HQ on this type of crap). Now they are hurting from a significant loss of revenue AND corporate is coming down on them. Today, the area manager (or some big wig) came in and chewed the whole management team out about their behavior and the loss of revenue to the company (it seems like this isn't the first time something like this has happened to them). Then, the area manager came to me with them and all of them apologized and then he did too. I haven't heard a peep from them since and I am as smug as can be.",

        "text": "This is an update from my original post you can find here: https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/8uiipb/see_you_in_court/\n\nHappened today. Couldn't put it up until now. Last of month + Friday = suck.\n\nLet me start with a little information about small claims, at least in my state. You can file small claims for up to $5000 for pretty much any reason. You just have to have a reason. You file the small claims, they get sent a notice, served by the county's finest. They sign that they received it. You get a notice that they signed, by email, and then you file your evidence. Court sets a date for the notice of small claims, usually about seven days out. Just so happens to land on the same day I have my evidence hearing with Lisa.\n\nEvidence hearings take place at least twenty days out from the original notice of small claims hearing. I have to file the evidence before the hearing, and the defendant can come and refute it at the evidence hearing with their own evidence. So that's where I find myself. Lisa's evidence hearing for her small claims, and Tina's notice of small claims. Technically, I only have to be there for the notice of small claims. Lisa had to come to the evidence hearing if she wanted to refute. Tina, however, didn't have to come at all.\n\nI get there, and it's just me and the judge. It's the Awesome Judge this time. Sweet. This is going to go smooth like silk. Anyway, no one else is there. He calls for defendants, and no one answers. We go in and take care of the first small claims I had (another guy, different matter, small claims granted). A few minutes into this matter, Lisa and Tina show up.\n\nSo then we get to Lisa and Tina.\n\nLisa's evidence hearing is a slam dunk. She has no receipts, because she didn't pay anything, and we keep pretty solid books. There's nothing she can do but admit she owes it and, abraca-fucking-dabra, she's got a rather large claim placed against her.\n\nSo now it's Tina's turn. She's been waiting patiently, though red-faced through this whole ordeal, and now the judge addresses me in regards to her. He asks me if this is Lisa's mother, and if she was the co-signer on the apartment, and I answered yes to both questions. I then verified the amount on the small claims, which was the same as on Lisa's.  This next bit is paraphrased slightly, but it is generally the conversation that happened.\n\nTina: \"Why am I getting charged the same amount? Shouldn't it be--\"\n\nAwesome Judge: \"Ma'am, this court allows for one person to speak at one time. When I am talking, you don't talk. When he is talking, you don't talk. When I am looking at you and tell you you can speak, you can speak, alright?\" To me: \"Why are you charging the co-signer the same amount?\"\n\nMe: \"It says it will happen right here in the co-signer form she signed when her daughter moved in.\"\n\nAwesome Judge: \"Let me see the co-signer form.\"\n\nSee, one part I didn't say earlier, because I wasn't sure if I was going to get Awesome Judge this time, as I got Asshole Judge last time, is that he is the one that basically directed me on how to do things when I originally messed things up the very first time. He was patient, answered many of my questions, and even warned me about other judges. I asked him about certain things that I considered loopholes to make sure I closed them as much as possible, and one of those was the co-signer form. How do I file against a co-signer? He pointed me in the general right direction, and it took a while, but I realize the co-signer form had language in it that was *just right* to take the co-signer to small claims for the same, full, amount. This was confirmed by a retired lawyer friend-of-the-family.\n\nI hand him the co-signer form, hoping that he remembered what he told me, and would follow it.\n\nAwesome Judge: \"Ma'am, this is your signature?\"\n\nTina: Silently, nodding, then, when told by the judge she has to answer verbally, \"Yes.\"\n\nAwesome Judge: \"By this contract you signed, you are able to be taken to court for the same amount as your co-signee. I am going to--\"\n\nTina tries to interject something, but Lisa actually told her to be quiet and the judge gave her a not very happy look.\n\nAwesome Judge: \"Mr. cmarin17, I am going to enter the claim for $4465.00 against Ms. Tina. Is there anything else you want to add?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, your honor. We've contacted Tina several times regarding her daughter's account, and we were always told she wasn't responsible and to do whatever we wanted to.\"\n\nAwesome Judge: \"Is this documented?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, your honor.\"\n\nAwesome Judge: \"Tina, you may now speak. Do you have anything to say at this point?\"\n\nTina is silent for what seems like two minutes, but is probably just maybe ten seconds. Finally, she asks, her voice a little shaky, \"What happens now?\"\n\nThe judge explains that she has twenty days to refute the evidence and statements, but she will need to provide receipts, bank records, or some other phyiscal evidence that shows that my evidence is wrong. Since there isn't any, I know there's nothing she can do. Her face is going more and more pale. The judge decides this is over, tells us we will have the full evidence hearing after twenty days, and to check our mail and email.\n\nI'm gathering all my stuff up, since I had brought *everything*. I'm not trying to stay, and neither is the judge, but he's having to enter something onto his bench computer. I hear Tina harsh-whispering something to Lisa about how this is going to ruin her credit and she won't be able to get that house, blah, blah, blah. I didn't care. I left.",

She also explains that 6 months later, when the 50&amp;#37; promo has ended, I will be able to register under my name again and enjoy whatever promo available for new user at that time. As the ISP contract only ban me for 6 months, and there's none that prohibit one home address to change names.

It was a fairly busy night and we'd had a lot going on, there had been a few people hard drinking in the bar but they were starting to drift off to bed.I get a call from the front desk, they've just had a room service order phoned in. Usually all I do with these is sort out any drinks needed and leave them on a tray in my store room for whoever is delivering the order to the room to pick up on the way past, but this time the lady on the front desk is quite agitated and sounds like she's not happy about something. $me is me and $fdl is front desk lady.\n\n&gt;$me: what's up $fdl? You don't sound too happy?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$fdl: this guy has ordered a bottle of champagne and two glasses to be delivered to his room and I know he's in there by himself  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: ooookaay, maybe he's got lucky  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$fdl: i don't think so, he sounded pretty drunk and he asked that the order be delivered by \"the blonde waitress\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: ffs! He must have been drinking in the bar earlier $blonde\\_waitress has been working here with me on and off this evening  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$fdl: well I'm sure as hell not sending her up to his room!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: no worries, get someone up here to cover for me and let me have his room number. I'll deal with it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$fdl: ok, just don't do anything that makes me have to fire you  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: I'll be the model of professionalism!\n\nSo, ten minutes later I'm knocking on this guy's door with my tray, a bottle of champagne, two glasses and a rose I'd stolen from a flower display in the corridor on the way there (just for shits and giggles). The door opens and here's a guy who's clearly seriously drunk, middle aged, wearing only a hotel dressing gown (bathrobe for our colleagues across the pond) which is gaping open at the front. It's painfully obvious he's got nothing on underneath and it's not a pretty sight! He registers my presence and looks annoyed as it seems I'm not who he was expecting. He will be $dg for drunk guy\n\n&gt;$me: your room service sir  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$dg: &lt;attempts to speak but makes only incomprehensible noises&gt;\n\nI walk in and place the tray on a table, usually when serving champagne we offer to open and pour it for the customer. It adds a little touch of class and avoids them spraying it everywhere.\n\n&gt;$me: would you like me to open it for you sir?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$dg: &lt;looking around to see me, a not huge but bigger than him guy, standing in his room while he's practically naked. At this point the penny drops and he realises the blonde waitress isn't going to appear&gt; no! Just leave it there!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$me: certainly sir, hope you both have a pleasant evening.\n\nI leave and head down to the front desk where $fdl and $blonde\\_waitress are waiting for me. I tell them the story, leaving out the nudity bit as I don't want to freak either of them out. We all have a good laugh and I tell them if they're ever unhappy about a situation like that again I'll always help them out. $blonde\\_waitress and I became good friends after that.\n\nThe malicious compliance? Well the thing is,  we more or less carried out the $dg's request, I'm also blond",

(Tbh he was pretty good at giving you ways to make brownie points and i did actually like him as a teacher but i guess he and i butted heads on the homework issue.)\n\nAnyway, as i said im a lazy piece of shit so i never, and i mean never, did my homework. (Especially for a lousy 10% come on!) I was, however, also one of those assholes that never studies and aces tests, and considering that tests were a whopping 75% of our grade and I was known to have something like a 103% average by the end of the semester (he always read the top three scores for the last test and our averages thus far and like i said - good about brownie points - i could sometimes miss one or two questions but id usually make it up with the bonus, and still score, say, “101%.” \n\nAnyway, come our midterm report cards, he gives me a 55%!!!! \n\nA 55. Not even like a D, straight up F-. Only thing on his comment section - “poor homework dilligence” or some bs like that.\n\nWell. Lucky for me, i had kept a copy of that little contract, and therein began my first case of lets call it... specific compliance. \n\nI first spoke with him and tried to reason that why would he fail me based on homework alone - regardless of my homework accountability, i was also pretty often participating in class. Math has always been my preferred subject and im not gonna lie its kinda natural for me and for the most part, easy. I like the logic behind it all. \n\nLong story short, a two week long debate culminated in a meeting with the M(E)yself, MTeacher, my Mom, VP and Principal where the conversation went something like this:\n\nME: Well i just need to know where you justify this grade. I am one of the top performers in your class, test wise, and participation wise, Ill be the first to admit, i dont do my homework all that often, but if thats the problem you have with me why are you dropping me to a 55???!\n\nMT: I had warned you several times that if you did not start doing your homework I was going to fail you\n\nMom: true?\n\nMe: true. HOWEVER. (Oh man i remember how excited i was to pull out my copy of that stupid “contract”) according to this contract that we signed because you gave it to us, homework is assigned 10% of our final grade, meanwhile tests are 75% of our grade. If i do recall correctly, last time we had a test yoh called out my collective average to 103%, did you not?\n\nVP: (looking to and fro between us legit almost comically) \n\nMT: uh... i mean yeah but i gave you verbal warnings about your homework\n\nMe: so yes, my average test score is 103%, for a 76% of my final grade. This should be the lowest possible score, and thats assuming that i never participate in class, which i dont think you can say, can you? I mean i feel i participate fairly often. On a scale of 1-15 what would you rate my participation?\n\nMT: ... maybe about a 8.\n\nMe: ok perfect, thank you. So that puts me at 84% doesnt it? So why am I failing?\n\nVP: ... why IS he failing? We have a bunch of students who are deseving of failing that we push through but youre holding him back? For what?\n\nMT: ....\n\nChanged my grade to a 87%. I dont think my mom has ever been so proud.\n\nAnyway long story but, i think it fits, i complied with a contract! Lol to this day: screw homework!\n\n",

Apart from anything else, on nights, especially on the weekend you get the dreaded late night walk ins.  \n\nThis night my co-worker was wandering around and I was left on the desk shortly after midnight. A couple come to the desk and ask for a room, I explained that we were full with my usual \"sorry we're full, we don't have a single room available tonight\" in the vain hope we could avoid the \"none at all ? Not a single one ?\" routine. Once we'd been through the routine and I'd assured him we had nothing, and that we were charging £140 for the night even if we had a room, hoping this would make him piss off. He drunkenly went and sat down and got his phone out.  \n\nI had an idea that he didn't believe me that we were full and was trying to book a room online. After a minute or two I saw him smile so I tried to warn him nicely \"excuse me, hi please don't try to book online\" he just turned towards me with a big stupid grin and put his finger to his lips to tell me to shut up.  \n\nOk.  \n\nA couple of minutes later he walked up to the desk and said that he knew I was lying all along and he'd booked a room for much less than I'd quoted. Then he ordered me to check him in, the prick thought he was hot shit in front of his lady friend.  \n\nI checked in the pc to look at his booking, and just smiled and said \"no problem, your room will be ready at 2pm\" my colleague came back just in time to help me explain that we were full and the price was indeed £140, but as it was after midnight he'd booked a room for the Sunday, which is a quiet night and the prices are lower, oh yeah, he'd booked the none refundable price too.  \n\nFuck you telling me I'm a liar and telling me to shut up when I'm trying to help.",

        "text": "I posted here a while ago about one of my good managers, so I figured I would post an instance of Malicious Compliance against one of my bad ones. \n\n\n\nI have a manger who we will call Jan, and we do not get along. The reasons for this are long and wide, but to sum it up quickly she lies to customers, makes up her own policies, is randomly mean to other associates, moody, and most significant to this story, she takes associates off their assigned duties to cover others. \n\n\n\nYou see, I work the service desk at [insert grocery chain here] with my very lovely fellow associate Ronda (name change). She is the yin to my yang, and taught  me everything I know about the service desk. I couldn’t possibly imagine working it without her (shoutouts to Ronda). However since we are both pretty good at our job, we sometimes get a little downtime between rushes. In these moments, Ronda and I scramble to get out desk cleaned and in order, however Jan sees this as an opportunity to steal me and cover cashier breaks.\n\n\n\nAt first I found this to be a reasonable request. Sometimes call offs can screw us over, or sometimes it’s just really busy or whatever, but I quickly found that this isn’t the case. The breaks are specifically spread out in the system to makes sure everyone gets there breaks on time, and covered by another cashier. By adding me to the equation sometimes people would end up getting there breaks too early, or too late. Also once I leave the service desk, it would get swamped every. Single. Time. Poor Ronda would be working in overdrive just to keep up until I got back. It’s understandable to pull me over to cover a break every now and then, but completely unreasonable to do it every day just because it’s more convenient.\n\n\n\nSo on to the compliance. One fine afternoon I had a nice lady come up to  the service desk to get a money order. I don’t see her enough to call her a regular, however I have seen her enough to get out of my professional shell, and speak more casually.\n\n\nAs we started the transaction Jan came marching up, and didn’t tell me, but commanded that I cover the break on register 3. I said alright, after this customer, and she marched off. As she walked away, our conversation went something like this. \n\n\nRonda: I cannot believe she is making you go out there again.\n\n\nMe: I’m not even surprised anymore. \n\n\nAs Ronda and I complained, my lady customer (LD) was digging through her purse for change, when she said \n\n\nLD: so you don’t have to go to that register until you’re done with me right?\n\n\nMe: that’s correct?\n\n\nAnd this is we’re LD’s master plan unfolded. After hearing us complain about the situation, she took matters into her own hand, and began taking forever getting the change she needed. She needed 42 cents to get to an even number, and she took nearly 7 full minutes to complete this task. I started keeping track after what had to be at least 2 minutes, so it could of been even more time.\n\n\nShe kept telling me she’s sorry, and she can normally find change faster. However she was giggling like crazy the whole time, so I knew exactly what she was up to. She was taking her time on purpose just to spite Jan. I told her to take her time, and it’s no big deal while occasionally looking up at Jan giving her a universal ‘I don’t know’ face, and  she could only scowl on. \n\n\nLuckily Ronda is an absolute god, and managed to keep the onslaught of other customers at bay while I patiently waited on LD. \n\n\n\nFinally LD found her change, I gave her her money order, and she left with a big smile on her face telling us not to work too hard. After she left I silently blessed her and went to register 3, only to find that the person there was already replaced. I went to Jan and she told me she won’t need me anymore because I took too long. The defeat on her face was priceless. I just told her that I was working with that customer, and couldn’t leave until I was done. \n\n\n\nIdk it’s a small victory, but god it felt so good to get the last laugh this time. \n\n\n\nThank you LD, I can’t wait for our next interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "This happened about 4 years ago now at a job where we were severely understaffed.  I was on a team of 5 analysts - 1 senior, one mid-level (which I had been recently promoted to), and 3 entry level.  At this time they had just replaced my open entry level position and I was training her in addition to carrying some of my work forward to my new position (you always get screwed like that with internal promotions) and then our workloads were just unreasonable in general.  I easily put in 70+ hour weeks.\n\nOne of our responsibilities was creating quotes for our sales team to provide to customers.  A single quote generally didn't take you long but the volume was huge.  Our service level (officially) was to turn over requests in 2 business days, 1 busy day if it was high priority.  One person was out for the week and my new girl couldn't do things unsupervised yet so we're only keeping our heads above water by me working until 11pm or later.  One sales rep was being extra high maintenance.  Sales people are generally type A, and I can handle that no problem, but over the course of 2 days he was constantly calling and emailing for changes for a customer.  I got an important project for a half million dollar margin analysis from our CFO and VP of sales that had to be done ASAP.  Which meant his 80th request to make a tiny change on a $20k quote was going to have to wait.  Like, a few hours.  I have a solid track record and relationship with the sales team for always doing my best to help them and get things done and so they are usually very respectful when I say I can't do something immediately because it means I truly must have something big happening. \n\nThis guy was just not taking it that day.  He kept emailing and I wouldn't respond.  So he started calling.  So I stopped answering.  Then he started calling the front desk to be transferred to me so that I wouldn't see his number.  Stopped answering that too.  Started calling from other numbers (I wasn't stupid enough to even pick up at that point).  Then he gets his regional director to call me who explains that this sale and relationship with the customer COMPLETELY DEPENDS ON HAVING THIS WITHIN THE HOUR.  Guess what?  He said that to me yesterday and the day before.  No dice.  I'm going back to work on my significantly higher priority project.\n\nSo the director calls our senior analyst who doesn't know that any of this is going on.  He emails me to nicely ask that I do the quote for him.  I immediately pick up the phone and explain to my senior what happened and he is on board with me not rewarding their bad behavior, but he did promise it would be done by the end of the day.  Oh really...  ok.  I will do it today.  It will be the very last thing I do before I go home.  And guess what time that was?  Almost midnight.\n\nIf this rep and his boss hadn't become such raging jerks about wasting my time and hounding me I would have done their quote in the late afternoon as soon as my project was done just to keep the peace and have good will.  But no.  They insisted on wasting my time, pissing me off, and going over my head.  Congratulations, you know get exactly what you were promised!\n\nBonus: no, we didn't lose the customer.  We also made more changes to that same quote for at least another month before they made the purchase.\n\nTL;DR  Sales rep blows up phone and tries to go over my head to get me to prioritize his low dollar sale over a project for my VP and CFO.  After getting my senior to agree (without knowing what was going on) to make sure that it got done that day, I did it as the very last thing before I left for the day, which was after 11pm.  If he hadn't been an asshole he would have gotten it much earlier.",

Apparently the last guys that went there stepped on her side of the imaginary line and she freaked, calling the owner. Basically he told us to avoid dealing with her as much as possible and just stay on our own side. We had a pretty big storm one weekend so limbs were everywhere. I was picking up the limbs when I saw her watching me, so I decided to be a jack ass. I grabbed a shovel and went down the property line breaking any limb (even the little ones) and only picking up the half on our side. I just looked up at her and smiled, and carried on.

        "text": "Disclaimer: A customer was doing the compliance, not me.\n\nI recently made a post regrading my experience at a large consumer electronics retail store (that I referred to as Pear for convenience) which turned out to be popular, so I wanted to tell another short story stemming from my time there. In case you missed the last post, I worked on the floor and sold a ton of pPhones, pPads, and pBooks to hoards of Pearsheeps.\n\nI was working a weekend shift about 10 days after the launch of the pPhone 6. This generation of the phone was a huge upgrade over the previous devices, literally and metaphorically, and as a result sold out rather quickly. Stock was very short and the company implemented the 2-phones per person policy for anyone looking to buy.\n\nThat morning, we had just received a shipment of about 300 phones. This was quite rare as the distribution schedule was typically undisclosed and as a smaller store we don't often get shipments of this size. Our store in particular was located close to an airport so our inventory was usually low due to international buyers picking up units before heading home.\n\nRight as we opened the doors, a stocky gentleman walked nonchalantly up to me and said he'd wanted to pickup 10 pPhone 6s, gold, 64GB. He had a heavy Russian or Eastern European accent and this look in his eyes like he's seen some shit in his life. I told him about the 2-phone policy per customer, and he looked at me for a second and said \"you don't vant my money?\" I told him I don't make the rules and I am not able to do a sale with more than 2 pPhone 6s at a time without manager approval. So he asked to talk to the manager.\n\nOne of my managers walked over and repeated exactly what I told him. 2 Phones per person, no exceptions, and politely asked him if he wanted to take home two pPhone 6s, 64GB today. The man thought for a second, turned around and said \"I'll be back,\" as he walked calmly out of the store. As he left, my manager informed me that this gentleman is a actually a well-known reseller who frequently purchases new phones in bulk and exports them to Europe to flip them (the exact type of customer that the policy is targeting). I didn't really care too much at this point and told him I'll let him know if I saw the man again.\n\nLiterally less than half an hour goes by before the man walks back into the store with a crowd of 20 people behind him. There were women, teenagers, and people of various ethnicities following him. My manager is alerted, and approaches the man to ask him what he wants. The man looks at my manager, then points back at the group of people behind him and says \"I vant you to meet my brother, my uncle, my sister-in-law, my cousin... etc. They don't speak English, but we each vant 2 phones each. Forty of them total, gold, 64GB.\"\n\nThe crowd of people behind him just stood there and didn't say a word. My manager told the man to have a word with him privately. They talked in the corner of the store for about 5 minutes before my manager calls me on the radio to ring through 40 phones for him. I complied and instantly jumped about 50K in sales that day (no commission, unfortunately).\n\nTo this day I still wonder if this guy called out a bunch of his accomplices or simply paid randoms folks out on the street to follow him.",

Then let it run all the way down again.\n\n\"You guys suck.\"\n\n\"Hey, we asked you not to play us.\"\n\nWhen he got the ball, we provided no defense whatsoever.  Do you know how fun it is to score on people that aren't even trying at all?  Not fun whatsoever.\n\n\"Ha ha, are you guys even trying?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nHe runs out of money.\n\n\"Ok, well, I'm going to quit now.\"\n\n\"Cool, we win by forfeit.\"\n\n\"No, I just don't want to spend any more money.\"\n\nMy buddy and I high-five each other.  \"Nice job.\" I start singing, \"We are the champions, my friend...\"  He decides to come back for more punishment.\n\nFinally, we get to halftime and it's 35-0 douchebag.\n\nI turn to my friend.  \"You want to actually start trying now?\"  \"Sure.\"\n\nSo we decide that we are both targeting his quarterback on every defensive play no matter what.  See, in Cyberball if a robot player gets too beat up it explodes and then you get a 2nd, 3rd, 4th string quarterback.  So after blowing up 3 or 4 of his quarterbacks, he can't even complete a pass and we are intercepting with ease. \n\nSo he finally starts running the ball.  We target only his running back and then he gets to the 3rd or 4th string on that too.  So he starts fumbling on nearly every play.\n\nShockingly (since we didn't even try for the entire first half), we eventually won the game 49-42.\n\nDouchebag was pissed, cussed us out and left.",

I had to find a temp job until then and found one for a small business in my town. I contacted him, let him know it was temporary, and we both agreed to the terms. He gets an extra set of hands that he doesn't have to worry about and I can show the younger engineering interns how to work on things. \n\nMy second week on the job, I mention to him that a design he was making wasn't going to work. He told me that it WILL work and just because I have my Master's doesn't mean anything because he has 30 years of elengineering experience. Whatever. He has a valid point. \n\nA week goes by and, big surprise, the design didn't work. \n\nHe pulls me into his office and SCREAMS at me. \"You embarrassed me in front of the entire company and made me look bad! You act like a know-it-all and I'm sick of it! What I say goes!\". I just sat there. I have never been treated like that, so I was shocked. He started yelling and I felt overwhelmed, and a split second later I saw red and wanted to fight him. Instead, I sat there and took it. I didn't say a word and just apologized. \n\nI was just trying to save the dude money. He paid a full time engineer and 3 interns to work on that design for a week, and I qas just trying to save him money. I almost quit that day. \n\nInstead, I am just sticking it out, biding my time here for another 6 weeks or so, keeping my head down and not offering any more advice. \n\nNow, onto the MC. He had this part I was designing, and it needed a rather custom screw. I designed the hole to be M4 (4mm diameter). When I mentioned this, he starts **freaking** out. \"I'm sick of all of the damn engineers here designing shit in metric! Make it a #4 hole! We are in AMERICA! *They* use metric! The Chinese use metric and so do the Russians and we have to beat them! WE HAVE TO BEAT THE CHINESE. Do whatever it takes to make sure it's made in America!\"\n\nAt this point, I'm floored. Honestly, I'm trying to keep it together. I was trying not to laugh. I did whatever was necessary though! I had custom screws ordered that cost $10 each. \n\nA pack of 10 metric screws would have only been $8.\n\nThe rest of the time here, I'm committed to following **exactly** what he wants, even if it is more expensive.",

        "text": "This will likely be rather long, because there is a lot of explaining to do, and some backstory.\n\nI work in property management and am \"taking over the business\" from my aging parents. They are currently in Europe on vacation, and difficult to reach, but not impossible. Me, I am running the office and doing about three people's worth of jobs. Usually, I'm pretty laid back, can get everything done, and can work with just about anyone regarding getting them approved for an apartment. Sometimes that works to my detriment. This story begins with a young woman named \"Lisa\", and her mother, \"Tina\".\n\nLisa is applying for an apartment. Lisa is a young twenty-something. Has a baby daughter. In some kind of abusive relationship. Poor work history. Third-party program was willing to help pay rent for a short while, and her mom, \"Tina\", would co-sign, as she had good credit. I approve her. So, for about four months, everything went along fine.\n\nThen Lisa loses her job. Starts to fall behind in rent. We send letters, she pays a little, then falls back to nothing paid. I call the co-signer, mother Tina, who basically says, this isn't my problem, I won't pay for her rent. Okay, time to move onto eviction notices.\n\nLisa, on the other hand, is completely avoiding me. I call, phone number has changed. I go to knock on the door, knowing she is there, and she doesn't answer. I put a notice on her door that I'm going to inspect her apartment, go there when I know she is there, she locks herself in the bathroom, turns the shower on, and stayed quiet until I yelled through the bathroom door. She promised to come in and do something about the rent.\n\nWhile going through the eviction process, Lisa gets some other, non-related, person to pay her rent to keep her out of eviction. But I know it won't last, and we are nearing the end of the lease, where I can just 30-day her, and get her out without the non-payment of rent. I call Tina again, see if we can work out something. Nope, nothing.\n\nAfter a couple court hiccups -- I had filed the wrong paperwork, as it was my first try at actually evicting someone -- I get both an eviction order and a large small claim against her. In court (which she suddenly decided to show up for), she asks why her mother isn't being charged. I replied that she is, and that she is going to be put into collections when I get the final amount tallied up. Lisa will be, too.\n\nSo now we're a day away from eviction. I've been getting calls all weekend that she's been partying, doing drugs. Even Lisa's child's father comes into my office, with evidence that she is doing drugs in the room her daughter uses, asking me for help. I tell her she's getting evicted, and he can come along and take whatever he wants that is going to be left behind.\n\nI go to the apartment for some other reason, and Lisa and her mom are there, carrying out clothes and such. Obviously not packed. I talk to them calmly, politely, and remind her that she's got one more day. The mother, Tina, talks to me some but seems more worried about moving stuff. The conversation lasts a few minutes.\n\nA day after the eviction, our receptionist gets a call. It's Tina. The receptionist tells me that Tina is asking to speak to my boss. Who is in Europe. I get on the phone, ask her if there's anything I can do. She says no, she wants to speak to my boss. I say he's on vacation. When will he be back? Early October (this happened this month, June). She says she will talk to him then.\n\nShe calls back, talks to the other property manager, who tells Tina the same thing. She finds out that Tina is upset because I \"didn't shake her hand.\" Demands my boss's cell phone number. Other property manager figures, he's in Europe, won't have his cell phone with him, no harm, right?\n\nWell, apparently, their cell phones do work in Europe. Next day, I get a call from my parents, wondering who this woman is, and why she wants to \"see us in court\". I explain, they chuckle a bit, and the call ends.\n\nSo, I decide, she wants to see us in court? Fine by me. I file for the same large small claim against Tina. She gets served, blows up my phone, which I am conveniently \"out of the office\" for a few days. The court date where I present my evidence is tomorrow afternoon.\n\n**TL;DR: Co-signer mother of an evicted tenant gets pissed I don't \"shake her hand\", says we'll see her in court. Yep, we'll see her in court.**\n\nEDIT: I didn't see any rule regarding updates, so when I do have the results, I will make a new post with what the fallout is/was.\n\nEDIT 2: The next part is in: https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/8uww9c/so_we_went_to_court/",

(If this is a substandard story, I will delete)\n\nI worked at a gas station that also did ice cream, some days we would do over $1,000 in ice cream on days we thought would be slow. this would be very hectic. One time I missed a customers bag of chips and we already did alot to displease this customer; So I told them I forgot to ring them up, but that they could just have them and apologized about the problems. Fast forward to the next day, my manger (A real dickhead who got mad at me for anything. I would be written up for forgetting temps once in a 6 months span. while He would do the same at least weekly), was holding the waste receipt for them and asked me about them.  He called me a thief and told me I had to pay for the bags of chips. A total of $4.16. Else I would be fired. I was really mad to be called a thief like that, I caused loss, shrink, I did not cause theft. Anyway I complied and payed for them using my Credit Card. Funny thing about credit card transactions is the report feature, 6 weeks later I got the letter in the mail from mastercard that my dispute was agreed in my favor and I got my $4.16 back. A store manager is not made aware of credit card charge backs, so he still believes I have paid for these bag of chips.\n\nFrom that day forward I only did what my shift task were. I was one of the only hard working employees. Many things stop getting done, I stopped setting up 3rd shift like I always did and 3rd shift would everyday go over, causing alot of overtime, which looked bad on the store manager.\n\nP.S. Just the month before I was doing morning paperwork and noticed we were short another $50 and through drawer open/close times, transaction records over $50, and the employee I suspected clock times. I within 10 minutes found footage of this employee throwing $50 bill in the trash. I then dug through the trash and found it. But shame on me for losing $4.16 and not knowing better to never give out merchandise. (It was allowed for customer satisfaction at my previous jobs and never really discussed at this one, a simple \"don't do that\" conversation would have been fine, instead I was treated like a criminal).",

        "text": "Sorry for the formatting I’m on mobile. \n\nThis happened about a decade ago when working for a large mainly red big box retailer whose mascot was a big red plug. \n\nI was a supervisor who closed the store often as an acting manager. When closing one night there was a problem with the alarm so I contacted the ops manager to let him know. I was yelled at over the phone to “Never fucking call me at night you POS!”  Hmm, ok well I’m a very revenge-is-best-served-ice-cold type of person so I decided to remember this. \n\nA few weeks later there was a fancy new key box installed on the wall in the warehouse. Warehouse workers needed to have keys to get into locked areas but they had to check them out and leave something like drivers license or car keys behind so they don’t walk off with the warehouse keys. One huge oversight was that only two people had the key to unlock this box, the store manager and the ops manager who both work opening shifts into afternoons. \n\nThis was the first night with the fancy box and I was the closing acting manager. Warehouse associate tells me his car keys are in it and can’t get home without them. I call store manager who lives an hour away. He tells me to call ops manager and we hang up. I was about to call when I remember that I was a “POS” and I was “never to call him at night”. So I took a crowbar and ripped this box off the wall, now there’s a nice hole where it was in drywall. I then smashed the shit out of it with some other tools we had laying around the warehouse. By the time the keys made it out the box was hardly recognizable. I placed it on the ops managers desk along with a note saying only “sorry about your box, associate needed his keys”. \n\nNext day I walk in at noon for my shift and immediately get pulled into store managers office with ops manager and get read the riot act. I just sat and waited for my opportunity. Finally they ask why I did it. I remind ops manager of the phone call, store manager had no idea of this prior call. Store manager asked ops if this was true, he sheepishly replied yes.  Store manager says “sounds like this is your fucking fault then get out of my office!”  I stayed behind and bs’ed with the store manager for a while then got to work. Loved that store manager, despised that ops manager. ",

        "text": "My first post here so please be kind :) also on mobile so sorry for formatting.\n\nJust a little background;\n\nSo I am a student worker at a university for the media services office where we set up the tech for events (microphones, speakers, mixers all that good stuff). This is my third year working there and I already had prior experience with my audio engineering/dj gigs from beforehand. Thanks to my extensive knowledge and my willingness to show up on extra events/overtime shifts, my boss really likes me and helps me out also whenever he can. Our school also has a History department filled with asshole professors who believe that they are entitled to everything.\n\nSo, a few weeks back, during the week of commencement, we are packed with events and I am literally working about 12 hours a day. All the other student workers are also working events and there are times when the office is locked down until a worker comes back from their events, pretty casual stuff for our job. So, after working for about 6 hours, I’m at my last event before I take my lunch break and the event is at the History building. I have finished setting up the speakers and the projector and am taping down the cabling (which is the most important part of the job as if anyone trips and damages the equipment/themselves, its on the person who didn’t tape the stuff down). It takes me about 20 mins to tape down the whole room and then I head back to the office. \n\nIt turns out all of my other coworkers are still at events and the office door is locked. So I proceed to unlock the door and I see a history professor we can call D waiting outside, visibly annoyed. Once he sees me he starts to yell at me for “not being at the office when I’m supposed to” and informs me that he has been waiting for 30 mins. I explain to him that this is an extremely busy week and that everyone is working events so there are times that the office is locked. I also point to the sign on the door which says “Sorry you missed us, please go to the room XXX for immediate assistance from the IT crew”. He says that he doesn’t care about the IT and he immediately needs to schedule us to work an event the next day (we need the reservations to be made 2 weeks prior to the events) and that he had seen me “taping some fucking cables instead of being at the office doing my job” At this point I’m getting a little annoyed because this guy is acting like a dick and taking time from my lunch break. Thankfully as he keeps yelling me, my boss comes in to the office. He asks the professor what is going on and then proceeds to tell him the exact same things I did word by word. The professor is still pissed off and mutters something like “retarded minimum wage fuckers” to which my boss still stays calm. He then says that he will take care of the event for the next day and asks him what he needs. The professor says that they have a huge departmental event and will have a dozen speakers so he needs about 10 microphones.\n\nThis is when it starts getting fun, my boss asks “all you need is 10 microphones?” and the guy nods and says it better be on fucking time and then proceeds to get out of the office and slam the door. Right after he leaves I try to explain to my boss that I was at an event but he immediately says its not my fault and to put the event in the system. He then asks me if I can work the event the next day so I say sure, I can use the extra hours. I am annoyed but I also need the money so I don’t really have a choice. The next day I’m at the office and I’m preparing the cart for the D’s event. As I’m about to put the cables and the speakers on the cart, my boss goes “I got this, don’t worry about it” so I’m like sure but didn’t you want me to work the event? He says nah, I got this, you can just stay in the office for if the other student workers need help (basically doing nothing). As I said, my boss is the coolest guy alive and he helps me out whenever he can. So I head out of the office and go home while clocking in the hours.\n\nI come in to the office the next day right at the moment where D is there absolutely possessed with anger, yelling his lungs out. Turns out my boss literally put 10 wired mics on the table for their big event and left. No cables, no speakers and no sound mixer. This guy and his speakers had to yell at an audience of about 600 students for their event. D said some shit about going to the dean of the college to get my boss fired for sabotaging an event but my boss just pointed to the camera at the ceiling and said “You asked for 10 microphones, you got 10 microphones” with a huge grin on his face. After D left me and my boss had a great laugh as we watched the security tape over and over a few times.\n\nTl;dr Guy was being a dick, asked for 10 microphones for an event and got only 10 microphones, no speakers or cables. Had to yell at an audience of 600 for 4 hours\n\nEdit: Grammar",

She just told me not to do shady shit again and to stop texting her. I love my mom. ",

        "text": "The recent story about breaking up with someone reminded me of a similar story I had. I'm not going to go into tons of detail, but they were pretty shitty and did lots of things that were unpleasent (Though I was by no means innocent either.)\n\nIt was the day that they were celebrating their birthday, because their birthday was on a weekday and they had school. We were talking about how we hadn't had much time together lately and thet said that we could hang out either before or after the party as just us, probably cuddling. Well, turns out we weren't able to be together alone at all, and so when I got home I expressed displeasure at this, and they got upset at me. They gave me an ultimatum, either do not talk to them or contact them at all until they contact me, or our relationship is over. \n\nA little bit after that I decided fuck them, I was done being pushed around and manipulated, especially since it wasn't the first time they had given me that exact same ultimatum, so I just texted them \"We're done\".",
