I love Biology and the STEM field but I’ve been concerned recently with a few instances how a Biology degree don’t end up netting you a job in a field of biology due to either not having different certifications or not having a hand in that specific field via internships. On the other end of the spectrum, biologists are in demand, with jobs available left and right for those who need it. \n\nSo I’m lost: is pursuing a Biology Degree worth it? Should I be looking for internships and volunteering at the same time? Is there something I should be worried about or should know in advance? I’d love to hear from other biologists about your two-cents.",

I will be using it while simultaneously live streaming to my computer, hence I want to stay with the trinocular set up. Camera will be purchased separately so just looking at the base package of each scope.\n\nSo I am down to these model's as of right now:\n\nOMAX:  **M83EZ, or** **M837ZL**\n\nAmScope: **T120C**, **T380C**, or **T390C**\n\nSwift: **SW350T**, **SW380T**\n\nOut of the 2 Omax options, I will probably go with the M837ZL as I found it for sub 400.\n\nOut of the 2 Swift options,  I will be probably going with the SW380T.\n\nOut of the 3 AmScope Options, I cant tell what the difference besides body is on the T120 vs the T380, and the only difference with the T390 and the T380 I could tell was the T390 was 20W halogen.\n\nNormally I would buy the LED over the halogen, but their LED power is 1 watt, even with halogen equivalence that seems pretty under powered at 7 to 10W max, so I may be leaning to the T390C\n\nSo unless the LED's are easily swap-able, it will be these 3 i need to decide between:\n\n1 - **M837ZL** (OMAX)\n\n2 - **T390C** (AmScope)\n\n3 - **SW380T** (Swift)\n\nDoes anyone know if any of these 3 above offer a Wider field of view, or smoother adjustment, or another benefit over the others?\n\nAppreciate any insight here =)",

However, during vasoconstriction, the rate of blood flow decreases even though the blood pressure increases. How does this make sense and why does this happen? \n\nAlso, as blood moves from the large arteries to the arterioles, why does the blood pressure decrease instead of increasing, since the lumen of arterioles is smaller than that of the large arteries? Shouldn't the blood pressure increase, just like it increases during vasoconstriction where the lumen also becomes narrower? Why does the narrowing of the blood vessel increase blood pressure in one case but decrease pressure in another case?",

I figured it was too big to be a bug, so I focused on it. I've never seen anything like this in my life and I've spent a whole hour googling trying to identify what it was but it turned up nothing.\n\nIt was maybe an inch tall, and it was standing upright. I noticed it was actually walking on what appeared to be two legs. It also had a tiny pair of arms and three fingers. The head was the shape of an egg that is upside down. The head was about as big as the body. The overall body shape reminded me of what a grey alien's body looks like in most illustrations. There was some sort of spike at the center of its head/face, and there were two beady eyes. Atop its head was some sort of stem-like structure, and there appeared to be a leaf of some kind sprouting out of the edge of this stem. I touched it and it made some high pitched noises, then it ran off into some bushes and I lost sight of the thing.",

If the pH increases above or decreases below haemoglobins optimum pH level, wont haemoglobins affinity for oxygen decrease either way? Same goes for temperature. Why do we say that decreasing the temperature increases haemoglobins affinity for oxygen and vice versa? If the temperature goes above or below the optimum temperature of haemoglobin, wont its affinity for oxygen decrease anyway? So how does this make sense?",

        "text": "As a wildlife photographer I have filmed around 10 American Pika this year in different states. Whenever I make a pika video, someone says there are only 400 pika left. The number is always 400, but I cannot find a single source on pika populations. Maybe I'm just bad at googling but I spent 30 minutes and couldn't find an answer. \nI understand their populations are decreasing due to global warming. It's very sad and it will become harder to find pika in the future if we don't change things. They have to seek higher elevations to avoid heat. But I have found at least 10 pika without putting too much effort in, so I find it hard to believe there are only 400 left. The Wikipedia page also says conservation status is of least concern. Anyone have any information on this? Thanks!",
