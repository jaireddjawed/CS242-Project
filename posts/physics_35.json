        "text": "So I was on a quest to find a piece of matter that could not be broken down into constituent parts or building blocks of that “matter”. So we took a rock, but noticed it was made of smaller parts. Different minerals, a variety of molecules, etc. finally we broke down one of those parts to a molecule. The molecule had space between it, and between the empty space there were atoms. Finally it appeared we found the smallest piece of “true” or “pure matter” but then discovered that that atom of copper for instance was actually largely comprised of empty space, and between the empty space were subatomic particles——electron, protons and neutrons. Surely, these must be the smallest peices of singular matter. But then we noticed that oddly, the electron is 99%+ empty space. The material that the electron is made of…..and this is where I get confused…..I haven’t don’t enough reaearch and I’m not a ph.D or qualified to speak on quantum mechanics, but am I mistaken in saying that the elements that comprise electrons are coming in an out of existence. The first time I saw the double slit experiment i began to believe in this great singularity. I’m starting to mentally masturbate here cause I’m way out of my depth, but if something does not exist (like the cat in the box) until my reality creates reality, then does that mean that the cat and I are the same? And if so does that mean that there is no space between things that appear separate?\n\nSingularity is theoretically impossible in a world comprised of matter right ? That’s why black holes shouldn’t exist ?  Doesn’t singularity mean that there is no space between things, and therefore “things” (namely matter, doesn’t actually exist,  because singularity cannot exist in the same universe that space and therefore distance exist? And without distance there can be no time?\n\nSo if “pure matter” cannot be isolated in a world where time is a function of velocity (is that correct, is time a function of velocity) then would it seem accurate that thought is the singularity of “all that which is”? Thought much like light has no mass. But thought has no distance. This makes me think that the reason nothing can travel faster than light is because light is the visible expression of thought,  bUt only at a certain wavelength (sort of like visible light, and the wave function in the double slit ex) \n\nIs it logical that the only conceivable singularity is thought? So where does a black hole lead? To singularity. Thought? But matter cannot be destroyed. Unless it doesn’t exist. Is it possible that thought is the singularity of The universe, or God, and matter cannot be isolated because it does not exist but is all thought? \n\nMy fav quote “we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively and for its own amusement   , so that the secret of its own nature may be discovered. There is no such thing as death life is only a dream and we are the imagination of ourselves”\n\nSince light has no mass and thought has no mass could the two be one? \nSince thought exists only in the reality of the perceiver (like the tree falling or the cat) could reality itself be both real fake and everything in between?",

        "text": "Sometimes a particle gets destroyed during kinetic interactions at the quantum level. We, in rocket league, call this “demo”. This is when a car strikes another car with enough kinetic energy to demolish the other vehicle. It requires a high enough kinetic differential.\n\n\nSometimes the group of particles interacting will “thermalize” and obtain the same travel path due to the shared kinetic energy at a particular vector. This is when a m.f. BUMPS you when you’re trying to hit the ball and all three objects in the arena (you, them, and the ball) all travel at the same speed (relatively) in the same direction.\n\n\nYou could say that the speed of each object within the finite space of the arena produces a certain amount of “average kinetic energy”, and assign a “temperature” to any moment within a match.\n\n\nSometimes particles will combine, reducing the overall kinetic energy of the arena. We call this “rule 1”. Basically rule one is that: if you accidentally hit front bumpers in a game, both players will (for whatever reason) keep holding down the right trigger as long as the other player continues to hold their right trigger, causing the cars to stick together. For some reason this has become a collective choice within the community and we all call this “rule 1”\n\n\nSometimes particles will actually teleport…like instantly be somewhere else. We call this “Lag”. Objects will sometimes just BE somewhere else due to the fact that your sister just got on the Wi-Fi EVEN THOUGH YOU TOLD HER IT WAS A COMPETITIVE MATCH AND NOT TO F WITH THE INTERNET FOR 5 F-IN MINUTES!\n\n\nI’m just wondering….if they are both so similar…..is the quantum realm CONSCIOUS like we are when we play rocket league 1v1 matches on our x-boxes and PlayStations?\n\n\nAnyways, gg’s everyone.

        "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI'm a 2nd year physics student and currently trying to get in computational physics. I give my first try to solving ODEs for a particular system. I've two questions to ask.\n\n1] Imagine having an infinite chain of particles tied to each other by springs. If you're interested by how particles move when you're exciting the system, you'll get differential equations by 2nd law of Newton. For a given n particle, you have an equation coupled to equations of neighbors particles. \n\nIf I want to approach solutions, I think I need to solve the whole system. Still, I'm not very interested to particles at the very end of the chain, but more to particles that are at the center ; I know that the way I'll set the edges will have some consequences to solutions (discrete modes, etc). How can I do to solve the system without really fixing conditions at edge? \n\n2] Secondly, I want to do the same for discrete lattice, having both horizontal and vertical chains coupled. For a n-th particle, should I solve separately equations for x and y? \n\nI'm using euler-cromer method to approach solutions but I'm also enclined to discover new algorithms.\n\nThanks.",

The probability density function appears normal. I was wondering if anyone knew why this happens - is it a poor attempt at data visualization on my part or is this just a misunderstanding re quantum mechanics?",

Sounds like the expansion of the universe making your local horizon smaller and smaller while pushing you away from the big bang or singularity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will say this again i fully understand there is a 99% chance i sound completely and utterly stupid right now but im just curious about whether that 1% chance that i don't sound completely stupid because i first had this thought at like 11/12 years old and im just curious as to whether teenage me should have put his efforts into going to a college and studying physics rather than just deciding to be the best stoner i could be lol.",

This would be assuming the universe is a white hole and not the universe would be created by a white hole I guess. I'm not very intellectual so I can't really disprove this idea so I was hoping an intellectual here could tell me why this could not work and why it is unintellectual:)",

I recognize that outside this would be much harder, but in an indoors environment, is it possible to design a drift-less parachute?\n\nAnything you could think of testing (holes, multiple parachutes, parachute shapes, etc) I would be open to testing.",

        "text": "I was watching a video the other day about the deaths of various masses of stars, and there was a brief discussion of how white dwarfs are prevented from contracting further by electron degeneracy pressure. Basically, the atoms are crammed so close together that their outer orbitals start to overlap, and since the Pauli exclusion principle says that no two fermions can be in the same quantum state, once the outer orbitals are full of smooshed-together electrons from the two atoms, they can't get any closer.\n\nMy question: What counts as \"the same quantum state\" for the PEP? I mean, two rest-state helium atoms a meter apart in an otherwise hard vacuum both have electrons in the same quantum states -- 2 electrons in the1s orbital, 1 each spin-up and spin-down. So clearly there is some distance at which the PEP doesn't directly apply, or absolute position is part of the quantum state, or the electron-degenerate atoms create new shared orbital configurations that obey the PEP, or something else.\n\nI'm guessing that the \"new shared orbital configurations\" explanation is correct. It seems to make sense that when they're close enough to interact in this way, you could no longer talk about orbitals in the way we do for non-electron-degenerate matter. You'd get orbitals associated with both atoms simultaneously, that don't look anything like the orbitals seen in non-degenerate matter.\n\nI'd be very interested to get (or be pointed to) a solid explanation of how this works.",
