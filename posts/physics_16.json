Using the laws of motion but excluding special and general rel i calculate that by using my rocket boosters and gravity i can accelerate past light speed before i will reach the neutron star. Obviously this is impossible. Now let’s say i accelerate towards the object and turn my rocket boosters on full blast to accelerate me more. Assume the most powerful rocket boosters imaginable. I know that i can never break light speed before i hit the neutron star but what will my reasoning for this be. What will i actually experience? What will my excuse be as to why i did not reach light speed before impact if you hypothetically asked me after my death? As i approach light speed in my reference frame will I see the distance to the neutron star length contract so that my distance to it shrinks and i dont have enough distance to accelerate past light speed?

Their math is simple by today's standards, yet remains correct. They are not studied or mentioned because they are incompatible with General Relativity - no four-potential, they are in three dimensions, and they treat these three dimensions differently (not Lorentz covariant). However, nothing in the simple math is incorrect, and they offer a path to unite gravity and electromagnetism.\n\nObviously, General Relativity has been tested rigorously, and if these two theories are incompatible that would pose a problem. But GR has many problems today: singularities must be unphysical, and there is a need for dark matter and dark energy to be added to any complete cosmology. The fact that GR alone does not remotely account the formation of galaxies, their gravity, and many other cosmological features in the universe could just as easily be shown to be a failure of our understanding of gravity as opposed to being the necessity for enormous quantities of dark energy and dark matter.",

        "text": "Hi fellow physics redditors, I'm in need of some advice. \n\nI'm 28 years old and completed my master's degree in theoretical physics in 2018 from a respectable European university. My GPA equivalent was 4.45.\n\nBefore starting my master's degree, I had decided that I wanted to pursue a PhD in string theory or a similar \"cool\" subfield of theoretical physics after finishing my studies. I specialized in mathematical physics and quantum field theory and took courses in topics such as GUT, supersymmetry, string theory, cosmology, differential geometry, representation theory, spectral theory of operators, and even representation theory of SO(n) group. My master's thesis was about representations of the conformal group. However, I soon realized that the more I learned, the more mathematics was required, and I started to hate the fact that I was becoming an abstract mathematician rather than a physicist. Due to this I burnt out and so after finishing my degree I started a job in data science, where I have been working since.\n\nRecently, a friend who is an undergraduate physics student asked me for help with homework problems, and as I helped him, I realized how much I loved physics before I went down the mathematical physics rabbit hole.\n\nNow, I am considering moving into a more applied physics field, like computational condensed matter. The problem is, I only took a few courses in statistical physics during my studies, so my knowledge of condensed matter is limited to e.g. basic molecular dynamics, the Ising model, and Landau-Ginzburg theory. This makes it difficult for me to choose a potential advisor, as I don't understand what most people in the field are doing.\n\nAnother problem is that I don't think I have anything that sets me apart from other candidates. I haven't published any papers (as it is difficult to do anything new in string theory as an undergrad), and it's been five years since I graduated, so most people might assume that I am a bit rusty in physics (which is probably true, though I have been trying to renew my knowledge by reading books and doing exercises). The only advantage I have is my experience in programming and statistical and optimization algorithms, which I have used extensively in my data science career.\n\nNow I feel like I have two options:  \n1) try hard to find a funded PhD program (I have already started this process but have not had much success so far, though I have only contacted a few potential advisors).\n\n2) start another master's degree, this time in condensed matter/computational physics, to increase my chances of getting a good PhD position. I have saved up some money so that I can fund myself for a few years without a stable income, but it feels risky to spend most of my savings on some goofy dream of mine.\n\nTo make matters more complicated - I also need to coordinate my plans with my soon-to-be wife, and I don't want to relocate somewhere where she would have trouble finding a good job.\n\nHave any of you had a similar experience? What do you think about pursuing a PhD in my situation? Do you think it's too late for me? I feel like life ends at 30. :D  \n\n\nSorry for the long post and have a nice day ;)",

        "text": "Hi everyone! I would like to ask for some advice from more experienced people, as I am struggling to find a way out of this situation.\n\nContext: I am currently a third year student for a bachelor's degree in physics, studying in this country that has many sanctions. I am originally from a third world country, and my most affordable opportunity to study physics abroad at the time was this country, as it was cheaper in comparison to Europe or the States. My resources were limited, I came from the countryside and my family didn't support the idea of me becoming a scientist, plus I didn't know any other language like German or French for applying to Europe. \n\nSince last year I am desperately trying to leave this country, I don't support what it's happening and I'm conscious that staying here will downgrade my CV, even though I have good achievements. Main issue for leaving is again money, I would have done it already if I had the resources to legally move to other western country. I am really hoping this next semester I will be able to transfer to another university so I will be able to finish my studies.\n\nI have already been denied internship opportunities in Europe as I am linked to an institution in this country (I completely agree with the sanctions), and I am afraid I will not be able to get any job for this summer to save some money to move away from here.\n\nQuestion: Taking in account the given context, is there any other thing I could do that could be better than my plan of transferring and try to finish my degree elsewhere? Do you know any internship programs that could accept me, even if I am still stuck here?\n\nAny further advice that could be useful is welcome, hope you have a great day (⁠•⁠‿⁠•⁠)",

Light doesn’t have particles so it’s speed is constant.\n\nDoes my ideas make sense? This is just a gut feel and nothing formal, so I’d like to get your opinions or where I can find data against this ideas.\n\nThanks in advance!",

The incident also occurred off San Diego in 2004.\n\n&gt;One of the pilots, Cmdr. Dave Fravor, told \"60 Minutes\" that personnel found a \"little white Tic-Tac-looking object\" moving above the water before it disappeared. Seconds later, his ship — the USS Princeton — said the object ***reappeared on its radar 60 miles away***.\n\nI've bolded the parts I'd like to see discussed, as I have not seen much discussion on those particular incidents. Going from 80,000 feet to 50 feet in one second would mean the object was moving in excess of 50,000 miles per hour. It is claimed this same object then shot up to 20,000 feet and hovered for several hours.\n\nCould this all be a hoax?",

I know that in the first equation Work is defined to be done ON the system and in the second it's done BY the system. It's also the case of the 1st law of thermodynamics (ΔU=Q+W and ΔU=Q-W respectively).\nBut if by definition you take W to be done BY the system, then if W is negative the work is done on the system, or if by definition you take W to be done ON the system then if W is negative work is done by the system, so there's here two definitions of W each if is negative indicates the opposite of the other (if it's also negative) and the two of them produce two lists of equations that differ only by sign. Therefore, shouldn't each equation derived from the work equation be clarified if W in the equation is done BY or ON the system? For example the Work done BY the closed system in Isobaric process is W=-PΔV and the Work done ON the system is W=PΔV. and does the use of one of the Work equations be accompanied by the use of the corresponding  equation of 1st law of thermodynamics, or it doesn't matter (as long as you know the difference between the definitions)?",

Light is equivalent life, dark is equivalent of death. We are a special type of light known to us as UV light. Light evolved multiple times over creates structures in greater and greater complexity until you have humans. Sight is consciousness in that it is the way we can perceive ourselves. Not just seeing, but sensory light as well (heat, sound). These are methods of interpreting light. There are laws of the universe that cannot be changed. Light and dark are stagnant states of being, color is variant and scattered when shone through a crystal. Crystals (or repeating patterns of carbon) are the only way to perceive color light. This is where we get art, personality, nuance. These color representations are similar to our emotions and can even tell us proximity to life and death. Colors must exist in a certain order for balance, clarity, and order. If atoms are misplaced, they become disordered and cast into darkness. There are many interpretations of this relationship in our day to day lives. I need physicians true thoughts. Thank you!",

So what if I give the burden of new problem writing to ChatGPT?\nHere is what I got for the prompt: write a numerical physics problem related to friction force.\n\"A block of mass m = 2 kg is placed on a horizontal surface and is subjected to a frictional force f_friction of 20 N. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the surface is μk = 0.2.\n\nDetermine the acceleration of the block.\nDetermine the net force on the block.\nDetermine the speed of the block after it has been sliding for 5 seconds.\nSolution:\n\nThe acceleration of the block can be calculated using Newton's second law:\na = F_net / m\nwhere F_net is the net force on the block.\n\nThe net force on the block can be calculated as the difference between the frictional force and the gravitational force:\nF_net = f_friction - m * g\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nSubstituting the values for f_friction, m, and g into the equation for net force, we get:\nF_net = 20 N - 2 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 20 N - 19.6 N = 0.4 N\n\nSubstituting the value of F_net into the equation for acceleration, we get:\na = 0.4 N / 2 kg = 0.2 m/s^2\n\nThe speed of the block after 5 seconds can be calculated using the equation for average velocity:\nv = v_0 + a * t\nwhere v_0 is the initial velocity and t is the time elapsed.\nSince the block is initially at rest, v_0 = 0 m/s. Substituting the values for a, v_0, and t into the equation for average velocity, we get:\nv = 0 m/s + 0.2 m/s^2 * 5 s = 1 m/s\n\nSo, the speed of the block after 5 seconds is 1 m/s.\"\n\nNow, I have a new tool to fight against Chegg :)",

        "text": "The International Prototype of the Kilogram, IPK is made of 90% platinum and 10% iridium. The IPK’s mass is almost never altered and is sometimes even used as the definition for a kilogram.\n\nBut my question is why platinum iridium is the material. Is it related to the thermal expansion? Does certain alloys have a smaller overall change?\n\nAlso, are there any alternative materials for the recreation of this figure?\n\n(I am not an expert in science, so I just want to know why it’s specifically platinum iridium)",
