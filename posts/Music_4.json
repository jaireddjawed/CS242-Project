        "text": "So there’s this guy who’s kind of an asshole that lives right below me in my apartment building. It’s clear to me that he has surround sound and he frequently plays his jams and it normally doesn’t bother me. But, every once in a while he’ll play it a very inconvenient time such as 3am or 8am on a weekday.\n\nThis morning, he decided to play it at about 7:30am and it literally woke me up from sleep. My bedroom door was closed and all that stuff that could help too. I decided to just get out of bed. I had about 7 hours of sleep and I’m off of work today.\n\nI happen to have a surround sound system myself. I also consider to have what I call “sound priority” where being on the top floor gives you the advantage. I pointed my subwoofer straight to the floor, hooked my phone up to the main speaker via BT, and played music with the deepest bass that I’ve ever heard. I could feel my floor shaking. By the time I turned it off, the music downstairs was completely gone. Any similar thoughts/experiences?",
