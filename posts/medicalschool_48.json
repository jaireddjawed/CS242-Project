I‚Äôm going to list the instances I‚Äôve had with NPs.\n\n1. Went to urgent care to get a strep test. That was my only purpose in going. Nurse practitioner listened to my lungs and told me verbatim ‚Äúyour lungs sound destroyed‚Äù. Send me for lunch X-ray that was completely normal. And I had zero cough shortness of breath or respiratory symptoms and I told her that. Then she told me well I guess I don‚Äôt need to give you medicine for pneumonia since the X-ray is clear. I was thinking no shit I don‚Äôt have pneumonia I don‚Äôt have any symptoms of it. \n\nDuring this same appointment, my heart rate was 110. I told the NP that my heart rate is always elevated in the office due to anxiety about having it measured but whenever I take it at home it‚Äôs always normal. She decides to order an EKG anyway. Now keep in mind that she orders this ekg right after I was just informed that my lungs are ‚Äúdestroyed‚Äù and I need a lung X-ray. And I told her I have anxiety. So my heart was pounding the whole ekg. She then tells me I need to see a cardiologist and even says I should possibly go to the er to have it checked out. My gut told me she had no idea what she‚Äôs talking about so instead of doing that I made an appointment the next day with my PCP, who is an amazing doctor.\n\nNext day at my PCP I told him everything that just happened. He listened to my lungs and said he doesn‚Äôt have the slightest clue what she thought she heard, my lungs sound perfect. He then looked at the ekg and told me I don‚Äôt know what she thinks she sees in this, these are normal waves. He told me I do not need to see a cardiologist.\n\nThen 2 days after that appointment with my PCP, the NP calls my cellphone?! She asks if I made an appointment with the cardiologist and I said no my PCP said I don‚Äôt need to. She then tried to press me to see one anyways. I hung up on her.\n\n2. Went to urgent care for a stomach bug. NP prescribed metronidazole. After the appointment I looked it up and my gut told me that sounds like serious overkill. Make an appointment with PCP and he told me absolutely don‚Äôt take that and prescribed me zofran.\n\nWhat the hell is going on with these NPs????? Do y‚Äôall see this happening? It‚Äôs absolute insanity to me!",

She asks about head CTs, chemotherapy regimens and time given (which honestly seems relevant for her), requested consults, and things like most recent CBC and when CBCs are scheduled to be drawn. She has even suggested CHANGING labs being drawn and adding different chemotherapy drugs that the doctors were never considering and continued to not consider after her input. They always entertain her, but is she out of her scope here?? To make matters worse, today we had a second medical student round with us in the Peds heme/onc unit and there were TWO dietitians, one who showed up ‚Äúbecause she wanted to round with us‚Äù. Obviously these patients don‚Äôt want a zoo of people coming in for most of them to say nothing to them and just smile at them. So what happened? The students were told ‚Äúonly one student per patient‚Äù and BOTH dietitians got to see every patient on rounds just to sit there silently and input nothing while the other one of us could have been learning and seeing this patient with the oncology team. \n\nIs this inappropriate behavior by the dietitian or am I just being cranky?",

        "text": "Just needed to vent. \n\nThe system makes no sense. Why is it that the doctors who need about everything are paid the least and therefore not attracting as many top students. This may just be coming from a disgruntled student perspective, but it doesn't sit well with me. \n\nI am definitely in the bottom half of my class. I've been told that by my dean. I did pass step 1. I've been passing my shelves and getting good clinical evals, but my shelves have been fluctuating on the lower side of the national average. I also don't really have research or leadership to write home about because I suck at studying and need to focus on that to be able to just pass. I've tried switching things up with anki, qbanks, reading review books, reading actual textbooks, videos, podcasts, whatever. I am just not an above average med student, which I am fine with. I fully accepted that when my MCAT was bottom quartile of the only med school I got into. \n\nI came into med school thinking a primary care specialty, and did enjoy that rotation, but I've been really leaning towards a moderately more competitive (not surg sub) specialty. Not to mention I only just passed that primary care shelf by 3 points so my clerkship grade wasn't great. Even if the more competitive specialty paid worse than a part-time pediatrician with a full Medicaid panel, I would still want to do it over a primary care doc making serious bank. \n\nHaving to study for step 2 has taken a toll on my mental and physical health. I feel like I don't know anything. Some question blocks I'm like a 70th percentile, others are like 20th. It just feels like a luck of the draw for what topics show up on test day and I've never been a stellar standardized test taker. If I don't do well on it, then I'll be less likely to match into the more competitive specialty and will apply primary care, which would make my imposter syndrome even worse. \n\nHow can I be a jack of all trades when my test scores clearly show I'm not that?\n\nThe thought of being a generalist scares the everliving shit out of me. So many drugs, signs, symptoms, etc. to learn about in some of the shortest residencies. On my family medicine rotation, I think I got good with the common things, but when a patient wasn't there for their wellness check, I just didn't have a good foundation to pull from. I do best on the exam questions related to patients I've seen in clinicals. The amount of pathology and management to learn by patient experience in three years of residency to then becoming an attending primary care physician doesn't fit with how I noticed that I learn best. Please just let me focus on a specific smaller area of medicine that I can be good at. \n\nStudents are incentived to pursue higher paying specialties in our capitalist culture. Good primary care doctors are invaluable to a well functioning healthcare system. They should be compensated more so more of the smart smart people wouldn't dismiss them because of their salary. I just want to pursue the specialty I think I'd fit best in, regardless of the compensation. I don't know enough to be a good primary care intern. I don't think residency would prepare me particiularly to be a good primary care attending. If I do go primary care, I'd probably burnout quickly and switch out of medicine before the decade ends. \n\nFor patients sake, I want them to have the best doctors in primary and specialty care. I don't think I fit that primary care personality, and me failing to do well on a broad general medicine test thereby pushing me to practice general medicine is not fair to patients. The sad part of me is saying I won't do well on step 2 to continue my waking nightmare. But I really do want to manifest a good enough score to be considered for interviews in my preferred specialty. I don't need ophtho scores, I just want to be average.",

We are currently in the process of setting up rotation schedules and we were wondering what others have done. \n\nThe general recommendations seem to be the following:\n\n1. Specialty of interest should be somewhere in the middle\n2. IM before surgery is a good idea\n3. IM in the beginning (to get the tough stuff out of the way) or near the end (for step 2 preparation) is a good idea. \n4. ObGYn into Peds is nice\n\nIs there a particular reason to put specialty of interest in the middle? The general reasoning behind this seems to be so that you are a bit more prepared to work effectively during the rotation if it's in the middle and if you don't like the rotation, you still have the other half to look into.\n\nHowever, if you're pretty confident on doing a particular specialty, why not do it last? You'll be most prepared and have a LOR that is most recent. \n\nLastly, if we follow the general recommendation of doing specialty of interest in the middle of rotations, that makes pediatrics somewhere in December. That is peak RSV season. Wouldn't that just make things more difficult?",

The way it would work for clinicals is that I would do \"2 on, 1 off\" or \"1 on, 1 off\" to use the \"off\" to study for and take shelves and hopefully earn some free time as well. This definitely sounds great to me - I would love to sleep more and do more fun things during rotations and then also do better on shelves with the additional few weeks of study time (they're graded for us). I think that I can crush shelves/rotations this way (more sleep, more time), as opposed to just get by and certainly not get honors via the default method.\n\nMy question is - how would this look for residency applications? I'm leaning hard towards psychiatry, with PM&amp;R also on the differential. Would the better scores/overall performance help my application, or would that bonus be outweighed by the fact of slowing down med school? \n\nThanks in advance :)",

Wouldn‚Äôt the thin filaments being more near the M line mean that more cross bridges can be formed and thus more active tension can be produced?

Got mainly low and some mid tier ortho programs but simultaneously (and unexpectedly) got very good rads IIs, as in quite a few of the top 25 on the doximity rankings.\n\nNow I‚Äôm trying to write up my rank list and it‚Äôs been a bit hard putting one specialty on top of the other.\n\nObviously passion is first and foremost in choosing a specialty and I always really like ortho. But I have come to kinda appreciate DR (analytical, lifestyle, can still make good cash, no social work) despite having been gung-ho in the bone wizardry department.\n\nSo a few questions if anyone can advise. Just trying to predict what position I‚Äôd rather be in a decade from now. Apologies if these are dumb questions, kinda at an impasse here so just trying to get some opinions.\n\nOrtho questions:\n1. Does where you go to residency in ortho matter if I don‚Äôt wanna do academics? That is to say, do certain private practices only want graduates from top notch programs or nah? Also am I excluded from certain fellowships if I go to a \"low-tier\" ortho program (ie newer programs, older programs that aren‚Äôt well known outside the region)?\n2. How necessary is it to go to the middle of nowhere as a brand new ortho attending to get a good contract? I‚Äôve heard going to large metropolitan areas really stunts the compensation and gives you a nuts call schedule early on and it take like a decade to make partner.\n3. When can you have a chill lifestyle in ortho as an attending and still make good cash? Guess a corollary to this question is when do most private practices let you buy into ancillaries and ASCs?\n\nDR questions:\n4. How significant is it to go to top tier DR programs? Do doors open up that would otherwise be closed?\n5. I've heard that compensation rates for reading images are dropping drastically for DR. Can anyone comment if this is true, hypothesize about the coming trajectory, etc? Fortune tellers welcome.\n6. Do some DR private practices have opportunities to buy into ancillaries (ie imaging centers or what have you) to build passive income as well?\n7. Token \"will AI take our DR jerbs\" question. (complete sarcasm on this last one)\n\nAnyone who was between ortho and DR, any thoughts about the decision making process or ideas now that you're in one specialty vs the other?",

I am very passionate about medicine however I'm unsure if I'll have the time to relax and meet likeminded people - let alone have time to myself.\n\nOf course everyone differs and it's different place to place, but if anyone has any experiences/advice that would be great.
