Zero calorie chips, Zero calorie candy, Zero calorie dipping sauces, etc etc. This will put nanobots into your tongue to trick it into tasting the desired flavor! Then the nanobots go into your stomach to simulate the feeling of satisfaction after a meal!\n\nZero calorie Protein soda and protein water! This will give you 50 grams of protein for the measly cost of just ZERO calories!\n\nEnergy drinks as meal replacements!

It was based in its own wiki-esque website and a few of the big things I remember was it was leaning towards the harder end of the spectrum, it had multiple classifications of singularity with each being to the previous as a singularity AI would be to us, and there was a massive section dedicated to a big fucking-over of the solar system. The aforementioned fucking-over was caused by a sequence of events that included AI revolt, bio-engineered plagues, and other such stuff and eventually culminated in the Earth becoming a \"tier 2\" singularity called Gia. I'll try to amend anything else I can remember while I continue to search for this setting again, and I'll note it here when/if I do find it.",

        "text": "Who’s read “Tomorrow and Tomorrow”, by Charles Sheffield?  What a fascinating hard science fiction novel!  It sure had some extremes in it, too:  \n\na.  A story spanning 43 billion years\nb. A population approximately = ((6^19)-1)/5, not including the main character, Drake Merlin\nc. Many selves:  the number of different versions of Drake Merlin was in the quintillions (one quintillion = one million cubed)\nd. Gigantic plants:  the Shiva, which were at least semi-intelligent, reached up into planet’s atmospheres and measured about 200 km across at the base\n\nDoes anyone know if there was ever a sequel to this?  If I remember correctly, [composite] Drake was telling his wife that all his selves, even if they were just digitized, not necessarily corporeal, amounted to an extremely huge amount of data.  Information is equivalent to energy, which is equivalent to matter/mass, so all his selves alone, not taking into account all the rest of the matter, dark matter, and dark energy in the universe, would condemn the universe into being closed, meaning that eventually, expansion would slow down, then stop, and the universe would ultimately compress back down to a singularity again in a “Big Crunch”.  His wife suggested that they escape their universe through one of the “caesuras”, artificial wormhole-like portals that could or did lead to other universes, where the laws of physics could be different enough to accommodate all of composite Drake Merlin with that universe ultimately compressing into its own Big Crunch.  That sounds like a great foreshadowing of a sequel:  Drake Merlin and his wife exploring a whole multiverse.  Maybe Drake could even shunt some of his selves into multiple universes and somehow maintain contact with his other selves, or meet back up with them and share novel experiences with them, or maybe these shunted selves could go on to create their own new composite selves.  At any rate, some of these other universes might be very strange, bizarre, fascinating, awe-inspiring, wondrous, and wonderful.  I remember that “Tomorrow and “Tomorrow” included an afterword that was a fascinating science article by Freeman Dyson.  Anyway, I just wanted to share some of my opinions and questions about the book.",

        "text": "My friends tell me I dreamed this character, but I'm sure it is from a novel about super-heroes. Please help me remember where this side character is from. Below is everything I remember:\n\nGhost Tank was a WWII tank that was inhabited by a Japanese spirit on an island in the Pacific during the war. The tank appears and operates no differently than a normal tank of its kind, except it operates autonomously with dog-like intelligence. Ghost Tank never runs out of gas or ammunition, but its firing rate and top speed are both very slow. If Ghost Tank is ever destroyed, its remains magically disappear and a reformed tank magically reappears - maybe overnight? maybe at the next full moon?\n\nGhost Tank is a side character, and doesn't do much for the plot of the story. I think it shows up about half way through the book along with some other rag-tag super-hero recruits that augment the main characters for a final battle. Since Ghost Tank's top speed is only 20ish MPH, and its main gun is not particularly effective against the enemy being faced, it gets left behind for every major story beat.\n\nI cannot remember what book or series Ghost Tank is from. I think its a super-hero franchise that has zombies in it, because the heroes have a base of operations (maybe in California) where they leave noncombatants when the go on missions. My best guesses are Stiletto (sequel to The Rook), Secrets of a D-list Supervillain, something by Drew Hayes or possibly The Dresden Files.\n\nAny help is appreciated.",

Due to how light travels and how space works, they'd need wormholes and massively faster than light travel, both of which absolutely destroy our conceived notion of what the Universe is and laws of physics. \n\nI'm not saying those are impossible technologies, I'm saying that any civilization that is advanced enough to have these wouldn't even bother with the primitive Apes that humanity is compared to them\n\n\n2: Just because we exist, doesn't mean they would even want us. There's nothing a civilization advanced enough to break physical laws and bend the fabric of the universe to it's will with FTL spaceships can't do that a primitive civilization could. There's literally nothing special about us at that point. There's an infinite number of planets with out exact same climates that doesn't even have inhabitants or sentient life\n\n\n3: If they have all these other advanced technologies, then there's literally no way humans could ever win. They could literally erase the entire planet in less than a second but sending a FTL missile at us. They probably could create bioweapons and stuff too.\n\n\nPoint is, there's no way for mere humans to ever even dream of fighting back. And the stories where the humans beat the aliens are even goofier. That's like saying Spartans could win a war against modern day USA. So goofy",

At least I think it's sci-fi, the concept is a science experiment (15) somehow getting out of a facility and the first person (16M) it sees takes it in and cares for it. \nI'm calling the story \"He, you, man.\" (Human). \nThe science experiment starts off as a normal human, but it gets mutated with, well, science. It can't speak, read, or write. However, it can understand words. The person that takes care of it is trying to teach it to do everything it can't, and he is even bringing it educational concepts to work with so he can teach it more about the world. The person ends up falling in love with the experiment and he tries to tell it, but it doesn't necessarily understand until he shows it what love is. The experiments name is Seven, due to a \"007\" being on its arm (much like 011 from ST). The human (doesn't have a name yet, suggestions appreciated) has taken care of 007 for a little over 1 month by now and has tough it as much basic stuff as possible, even gender concepts (since the human has friends with different identities). This is when he learns that 007 was born a male and has never been referred to as such. It has only ever been called \"it\". \n007 learns about all these feelings and such and falls in love with the human, this is when 007 speaks for the first time. \n\nIt points to the human and says \"He\"\n\nIt points to itself and says \"you\"\n\nThen it grabs the humans hands and says \"man\"\n\n\"Human.\" \n\nAny suggestions or comments?
