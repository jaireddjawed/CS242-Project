        "text": "This is my first post here so if this isn't where it belongs, please tell me. \nThis morning I decided to reorganize my bookshelf. To do this I completely removed all the books from one shelf at a time, wiped the shelf down, then put the books back. I have more books than space on the shelves, so I rearranged a few and stacked them on top of each other in places. \nNow, there's a gap between the wall and the shelf, so on two of the shelves I use bookends to keep them from falling in the gap. But on the second to bottom shelf I just press the books against each other really tightly and they hold themselves in place and don't fall. \nI was really happy with how much cleaner it looked and admired it several times throughout the day, and all of the books were pushed back into their spots, but about half an hour ago I noticed that one book was pulled about half way out and slightly up (like the bottom wasn't flush with the shelf; it was at a slight angle.)\nI thought maybe the book had slipped, but this isn't the one against the wall, it's completely on the shelf. \nNo other books were disturbed, including he ones on either side and stacked on top, which is really weird because they're so snug that you have to really kind of yank one out and hold the others in place so that they don't all fall. \nI have cats but I don't see how they could have done that without messing any others up, and I've been on my bed or desk all day with a clear shot of the shelf and would have heard them climbing on it, which they never do anyway.\nMy dad got home about five minutes before I noticed, but he hasn't been upstairs where my room is, and it's just been me alone all day. \n\nI know this doesn't seem big but it really creeped me out?",

        "text": "I hope this is the right place for this.  Something truly odd happened to me last week and I'm having no success googling it to see if there's a scientific explanation, so I'm honestly not sure if I'm losing my mind or if I had the most boring time travelling experience of all time.\n\nSo: In order to get to work at 10 every day, I begin a 3 stage journey on public transport at about 9am (a bus, a train and another bus).  I might be 5 or 10 minutes late occasionally if the bus is late but never more than that, and never willingly, because I'm a little terrified of my boss.  Last Thursday, I woke up while my wife was getting ready for work at about 7.30.  She left, and called me at 7.45 asking me to look for something she'd left behind.  I got out of bed, went downstairs to find it, and text her at 8am (which my phone verifies).  I then quickly got dressed, made breakfast, and ate it whilst watching a 40 minute long TV show (I double checked my Netflix queue when I got home and I definitely only watched one episode).  By this point it was 9am so I grabbed my stuff and left to catch the 9:07 bus, but realised I'd forgotten my headphones, came back, got them, checked the clock (9:12) and left to catch the 9:17 bus, which came at 9:19.  The point I'm making is I was repeatedly checking the time, on my phone, my laptop, my coffee maker and my radio (all digital).  The 9:17 bus will still allow me to get to work by 10am.  When I boarded, I realised my phone was low on battery (curse you Pokémon Go), so I closed down my apps and stuck it in my bag.  The rest of my journey went normally- no delays at all.  When I was 1 stop from my job, I checked my phone again- and it was 10.57.  I ran into work asking about the time, thinking maybe the clocks had changed without me knowing, or my phone was wrong, but nope, it was 11am, I was an hour late, and my boss was pissed as hell.  \n\nI have spent days trying to figure this out.  All the clocks were and are keeping the right time.  None of the public transport was delayed. My morning routine was exactly the same as usual and couldn't possibly have taken 2 hours. What could have happened?\n\nTL;DR: A 1 hour journey somehow took 2 hours with no explanation.  ",

I wasn't a Marvel fan at all back then so I didn't know anything about the movies other than the couple of characters I only hear about from time to time. Flash forward to a year or two after that when I first saw The Avengers, and I for some reason remember Nick Fury and I remembered him being there in one of the Hydra Headquarters scene. I didn't know much about marvel then either and I didn't know who Nick Fury was. I just suddenly remembered him from that scene. So me and my family got a little familiar with Marvel because of the first Avengers movie so a few weeks and whatnot after that that I started to play Captain America (which was on netflix back then) and I kept trying to tell my parents to guess who this next guy was when the scene I remembered was near. And there was no Nick Fury. I never remembered Red Skull either. ",

Which I don't know why, but I did.\n\nI was mad and texted a coworker and told my girlfriend about it.  The fridge is cleaned out every Friday, but this was a Wednesday.  There were not any remains in the trash can, because I looked in there before I left. \n\nThe next day, I come in and my coworker that I texted said, \"I don't know what you are talking about.  All your stuff is in the fridge...\"  I didn't believe him, so I went to the fridge and it was all in there.  Everything that I left.  The snickers bar was cold as if it had been in there the whole time and the cheese things were not missing.  \n\nThere are ten total people in this office.  When I left, there were two people still here.  When I returned, there were three people here.  I don't know why anyone would be messing with me, nor am I accusing anyone.  I just don't know how I could have possibly missed that blue bag, especially since there were not any other items in the fridge.  I'm freaked out. ",

I can recall the movie to an extent, all the super villains that become heroes are in jail and need to take care of a situation that only they can handle. I dont remember the exact plot because I didn't find it interesting enough. I remember the girl smashing a window and saying \"what we're bad guys\" pretty much right after they all get out of prison.

We shared the bedroom. Our bed were side by side to each other. In between there was a space for one person to walk for. I hope you guys are getting the picture. if not see this ( http://prntscr.com/br5j2g).\n\n\nI woke up early. I was looking at the roof of the bedroom. Kept laying for like 5 minutes. I did not look to my sister's bed etc. I was about to stand(for going to bathroom) when i saw my sister towards the end of bed standing, Looking at me.\n\n\nNow here is the interesting part i sat on my bed and said to her \"what are you doing, this early?\" She did not say a word.\n\n\nI said to her \"Go to bed now! or i will tell mom\". She went towards the door. While she was going. I looked for my slippers and i saw my sister's bed. She was Sleeping. And by this i clearly saw her face. Not like she was Pranking me or something.\n\n\nI got scared as hell! I hide under the Blanket. For like 2 hours till my mom came. I told her why i was hiding. I got a high fever the very day.This happened like 10 years ago. And i still remember it crystal clear.\n\n\nA similar encounter happened 2 years ago. I went to the bathroom to wash my face. I saw my mom laying on bed watching tv. When i came out of the bathroom. I asked her to make juice for me and she nodded. I went to my room and she was sitting there. See this pic (http://prntscr.com/br6he7)\n\n\nNow she could have not overpass me cause i directly went to my room. Now i don't know what kind of experiences were these. My mom was shocked when i told her that i saw her like just a minute ago in her room.\n\n\nWe are in the Same house. As we were 11 years ago, And the most Interesting part is that. Before we bought the house. A kid had a even worse experience then me.\n\n(Additional not my Experience)(Start)\nThere is a storage room in our house. What the kid tells us that. He was in my current room sitting. looking towards the room straight next to mine which has the storage area. He saw an white entity coming out of the door.\nWhat he Describes it like (The entity was pure white, Glowing! no nose, just eyes, no ears, wasn't transparent and was floating, no hands, ). He was around 20 at that time. He says it followed him till he left the house. He got scared as Hell and that's why his parents left the house.\n(End)\n\n\nThese are totally unexplainable experiences. Even if i say the story told by him is just a lie, I can't explain the encounters happened with me. I never drink, smoke take drugs etc. What are your theories guys? I would love to hear them. Sorry this was this long...\n\n\nEdit: for those guys thinking why we bought that house even if knew about the encounter. He told us like 5-6 years later after we had bought the house.",

        "text": "To give some sort of perspective here, I’ve been awake for about 24 hours now, purely because of this subreddit thoroughly fucking me up. Whatever this is, be in Mandele affect or glitch in the matrix, I feel y’all will at least enjoy this.\nTo preface this, you’re completely free to discredit my entire story because I’m on antipsychotics, but my brother also remembers this, so I have no idea. I barely experience the psychosis side of schizophrenia, more executive dysfunction and weird empathy, but I thought I’d add a disclaimer just in case.\nMy brother is a year older than me, I’ll call him Shaun, and we spent a good portion of our childhood out in the woods behind our house, and in this huge clearing that was about the size of two trailer homes, and surrounded entirely by forest. I remember it so clearly, because every year for the fourth of July, Shaun, our dog and I went camping out in this clearing so we could mooch off the neighbors fireworks. To our knowledge, other people definitely knew about this place too. Every time we would go, be it some game we were playing or running around with our dad’s camera, we always ended up picking up empty beer cans and cigarette cartons. At one point, when I was around twelve, we actually ended up scoring one of those weird holographic pocket knives.\nPretty much, the both of us knew those woods like the back of our hands, and because mental illness kinda runs in the family (thanks dad), Shaun always counted his steps to the clearing and back due to ocd. 82, give or take a few weather we followed the creek or not. We even marked our “special” trail, which had already worn down with all of our walking, with wooden stakes with cut up pieces of a hoodie drawstring that came off in the wash, and I actually ended up losing some expensive lens on our dad’s camera in this clearing. This’ll be important later.\nShaun left for college in 2014, I left in early 2015, and we both decided we would go keep our dad company during spring break, seeing as we didn’t really have anything to do on our respective campuses, and after a couple beers and an hour or so of reminiscing about our childhood, we decided to take a trek through the woods at two in the morning.\nShaun counted his steps, and still being roughly the same size he was at age sixteen, counted his steps. We followed the beaten path now overgrown with weeds, our stupid drawstring stakes were still there, but 82 steps later, we were still in full grown trees. The path just stopped. We even saw a piece of slate we pretended was some ancient slab when we would play around here as kids, and stuck halfway in the dirt directly next to one of these trees was the old lens for my dad’s camera.\nNow, at this point, I was straight up dissociating, because none of this made sense. We both remembered the clearing so vividly. And there was no way full grown trees, covered with the same amount of moss as the rest of them, could grow in the few months between me graduating senior year of high school, and coming back on spring break less than a year later.\nSadly, the camera was sold years ago, and I doubt our dad even kept the stupid movies we used to make on there in the first place. If this is on the wrong subreddit, or if this isn’t exactly what you’re looking for, feel free to take this down. I literally made an account just to post this because I’m not an active user, and just happened to stumble upon this when my brother showed me, and thought I should type this up. Also, sorry for any weird grammar or punctuation, again I've been awake for a very long time thinking about this. I also can't seem to fix the formatting on this, again, new to reddit.",

        "text": "My last major disparate jump to an alternate parallel universe/simulation occurred on 28 December 2015 in the UK. I was crossing a street on foot to get to my hotel. I stepped out onto the street, carelessly, with headphones on, without looking, and a big van was literally right THERE.\n\nI felt my nose almost touch the van, as it careened down the 20 mph road at what must have been 60 (100 km/hr). I felt the wind of hte van against my nose, as I was about 1/8th of an inch from it getting torn off. The force of the wind wake knocked me to the ground. Then van guy never slowed down.\n\nExtremely visibly shaken and knowing that I had almost certainly died in another parallel universe, or at least been grieviously injured, I crossed the final 20 feet (6m) to the hotel and proceeded to go to my room: 240 on the 2nd floor, through the main corridor, through the side corridor, and up the stairs.\n\nExcept. There was no side corridor. I had been staying for 2 weeks. What used to be a glass door leading to ~20 rooms on the first floor and 20 on the 2nd was now an empty wall.\n\nI frantically tried to find my room. I doubled back and went up the stairs in the lobby, only to find a Do Not Enter sign on a locked door leading to the corridor i walk through multiple times every day.\n\nI rushed by down to the lobby. A guy in his 20s I'd never seen before asked me if something was wrong. I said, \"I can't seem to find my way to my room, Room 240.\"\n\n\"Sir! He said, clearly disturbed. There IS NO Room 240! The entire second corridor was burned down a few years ago and we're just now rebuilding.\"\n\n\"That's impossible! I've been staying there for 10 days!\"\n\n\"I don't know what to tell you! What's your name?\" I told him. \"It says you're in 115 right down that way. Would you like a new key made?\"\n\nI was like, no. And I started freaking out but i decided to calm down and figured I needed to see what else was different in this reality, maybe it's a better place?\n\nI went outside and meditated and in 5 minutes my friend drove up for our previously-planned outing. I told her what was happening.\n\nWe both walked into the lobby, and the guy wasn't there. It was the girl I always remembred. I asked her where the guy was, by his name, and she looked puzzled and said, \"I don't know who you're talking about.\" \n\nI asked if she had seen me leave the hotel just minutes before and she said, no, that she had been standing there all morning and hadn't seen me leave since I went to my room. She then said how that was strange, how she didn't see me leave but now sees me return (there's only one entrance/exit).\n\nMy friend and I went towards the corridor, but now there was a glass door again, and I was effortlessly able to enter my room.\n\nHere's the google maps of the hotel. https://goo.gl/maps/qWgpB4dYQFu\n\nI was staying near the middle of the side building that juts out to the side on the left. The van nearly mowed me down in between the KFC and BP gas station. I have no idea how it could be driving that fast in that area, but it did.\n\nI instantly realized that this was probably a clear indication that Quantum Immortality, at least in my case, is probably legit.

        "text": "Last night I had a really vivid dream of living and working in NYC. In real life I have only been 3 times and even then I don't know the city that well ( I'd be lost without a tour guide or map etc). The dream was so vivid it kinda freaked me out. In the dream I was working for a limousine company that drove VIP's in and out of the city. I seemed to know the city quite well, I was driving in and around the streets without a problem. I knew where everything is and all the current news and events regarding NYC. Now onto the weird bit, the \"glitch\" if you will.  Around lunchtime this morning I get a call from my friend asking how I'm enjoying my stay in NYC.  I told her I wasn't in America and she flips out. She had a very strong feeling or knowing that I was in NYC. Ever since lunchtime today I have felt a strong and growing connection with the city.  Is it possible I have another \"me\" that lives in NYC and I slipped into his or her universe? Has anyone else had this thing happen to them before?\n\nNote:  There are probably grammar mistakes and stuff but I am on mobile and it's a pain in the ass typing on this.",

As in, NONE of the posts appear on the other one..?\n\nFor example, right now,  I'm looking on my phone, and there were two really interesting posts, one about a person's cat turning into a dog for a few seconds, and another one about cult English comedy 'The Young Ones', and a hitherto-unnoticed fifth cast member appearing in certain scenes. \n\nI wanted to read them more comfortably, so I switched to my laptop, which I'm now typing from, and there are no such posts, or any of the others from the phone. But the times of posting all overlap, between phone and laptop. The only new-ish ones I can see HERE are 'Everyone is crazy except me', a grandmother glitch, and a Philly man standing on a grate...(I had read all the others up to those ones already)\n\nIs this, in itself, a glitch of the most terrifying kind?? Please don't disappoint me and tell me that there is a common and logical explanation for this, and that it happens to people all the time, due to, like, technology or something :(\n\n(What would be really spooky now, is if this very post shows up on my phone, but not on my laptop)\n\nThanks in advance.

None of it makes sense from a logical perspective.\n\nAnd also, from people killing each other over petty arguments, to ignoring others who are in pain and need and then complaining when they are in pain and need, it makes NO SENSE. There is literally zero logical explanation for the foundation of human behavior.\n\nI hear about scientific advancement and reasonable decisions but they're never personally experienced by me, these things are only talked about from far away. In person everyone seems to be operating on unspoken unknowable motives that seem like they were drawn out of a hat. I don't think I've ever seen someone follow a fully logical train of thought in my entire life. \n\nNothing at all makes sense about the way people act or behave, I am 100% convinced, that by conventional definition, everybody other than me is clinically insane.\n\nIf this is the matrix the AI is broken and needs severe work. I'm stressed out because people are not only unpredictable but also unstable, it's like their brains don't really work they just pick random actions.\n\nHas anyone else felt this way?",

I parked and walked down to the pool, usually that's where she is in the summer. \n\nAs I'm walking and about 30ft away I notice a duck swimming on the surface. I grab my phone to take a pic. On my phone if you double press the power button its a shortcut to the camera. I double press and it starts but freezes and turns to black screen, not something I can recall it doing before.\n\nI look up and I see a figure moving and duck down behind the deck by the filter. This isn't it uncommon, as my grandmother fiddles with the filter whenever she cleans or does maintenance to the pool. I notice a bright pink color, I figure it's her shirt, but it's hard to see much more than that because I can only see through deck spindles from where I'm standing.\n\nI then hear her say, \"SHOO\" and the duck reacts. It jumps onto the side of the pool and then flies away. Just as it goes out of site my phone \"unglitches\" and the camera comes on.\n\nI laughed, because she has told me before that she's had problems with ducks making her pool home. I start walking around the deck and say something to announce I'm here. \n\nI turn the corner and face the filter...there's no one there. I look back toward the house. I walk around the pool. No one.\n\nI walk back up to the house, go inside and call out. She answers, she's in the back bedroom. I go back there and find her at her computer, wearing a bright pink shirt.\n\n\nNeedless to say this is messing with my head a bit. Its almost as if my brains way of dealing with it is to push it out.\n\nI asked her if she was down at the pool, as if a 73 year old woman could sprint past me up a hill without me seeing. She was not. I ended up telling her and later my boyfriend what I saw. They were both strangely apathetic about it. The whole thing just feels weird.",

        "text": "So this happened a few days ago to my friend and it was so weird she called me about it.\n\nShe was at home in her basement playing a game alone, wearing only one earbud in her ear, that way she could listen to the game music while staying aware of her surroundings. She heard footsteps and breathing behind her which was weird because no one was supposed to be home at that time (noonish). I considered the possibility of it all being the game music but she was 100% sure it wasn't. The chances of anyone in her family coming home early that day was zero so she panicked and went upstairs. \n\nThats when she noticed that a few things weren't in place like her curtains. However, it would have impossible for anyone to get in via the windows because they were locked and too far from the ground for anyone to climb up. She checked her front door, basement door, and all other entryways to find they were locked as well. Normal.\n\nSo she goes to her room, locks her door, and takes a nap. She texted her other friend about the situation before falling asleep and wakes up to find him sending a million worried texts and calls. So she calls him back to let him know she's good. You'd think it's all over, right? Probably just her imagination? Nope. She later scrolls up to see all of his worried texts only to find 2 messages (http://imgur.com/HQR8HNv) she sent when she was supposed to be asleep. She's a light sleeper (is that the word?) meaning when she wakes up, she stays up so she couldn't have sent 2 messages and fallen back asleep. She's also not the type to just send 2 measly texts to calm a friend down (other friend didn't think she sent them either) so we're all super confused and freaked out as to who sent those texts.\n\nAlso, a little bit later she was facetiming worried friend and both she and worried friend felt/saw a shadow pass quickly over her rooftop window in her room. I go over a few hours later and help search her room only to find nothing/no one. Weird.\n\n",

        "text": "Ok so on the 15th which was a Wednesday I went to lunch at Mcdonalds. I don't know if the value meal numbers vary between states or what but I know for a fact that NJ and MD have the same numbers for everything (this is important later).\nAnyway I am looking at the order board and the #3 is the quarter pounder with cheese it has always been and that is what I order. The order number was 321 and I went to the side and waited. Eventually I very clearly heard them call 321 so I went to grab it. I even asked \"321?\" and was told yes and have a good day.\nAs I fill up the cup they gave me on my way out I thought I heard them call 321 again but figured I misheard. When I got out to the truck I reached into the bag and found it was a ten piece nuggets instead of the burger. I was in a rush and said screw it. Didn't think much of it (a mistake at McD's isn't that rare an occurrence).\nLater that night I'm at a convenience store and go to where they keep some premade food when they have it. This chain makes a bagel sandwich with pepperoni but I knew chances were slim that they'd have one made at this time of night. Sure enough there was no sandwiches, only boxes of other appetizer type stuff. I went and ordered some food from the counter and my order number was 621 (I was tired and the similar number of my McD's order didn't occur to me at the time).\nI go and get a bottle of water and am going up with bottle in and food receipt in hand to pay and I pass the premade food thing again and there's a pepperoni sandwich behind all the appetizers from earlier. There is NO chance I missed it the first time. While I can't say for sure that it wasn't added when I was out of sight for ~30 seconds it wasn't as hot as when they first come out and it was in the back on it's own. I cancelled the food order and took the sandwich.\nThose both happened in NJ. The next day I was in MD with my wife and she wanted to run through McD's. On the way there I told her about how they messed up my order in NJ the day before and that now maybe I'd actually get the quarter pounder. I ordered the #3, again while looking at it on the menu board and drove home with our food. I sit down and pull a ten piece nuggets out in place of the quarter pounder to my, and my wife's disbelief. I waived getting the receipt but I would have shit my pants if it was order number 921. Still odd over all.",

It just seemed like a bunch of paranoid people over thinking little coincidences, but this, this was no coincidence. \n     I was on the main floor of my house in the kitchen looking into the fridge after a nice nap. I grabbed a freezer burned hotpocket, tore off the fragile cellophane wrap, and nuked it in the microwave. As I stood there impatiently waiting and entranced by the intermittently growing aroma of the Philly cheese steak, someone came through the door and walked into the living room. My little brothers voice called out \n\"what's up jake\"\n\"Making food\" I replied\nThe conversation ended at that and my attention readjusted to the piping hot food the microwave just spit out. Being the impatient, food crazed person I am i took a regrettable bite out of the steaming hotpocket and seared my tongue. I plopped the plate onto the island in frustration and decided to go complain to my unlucky little brother in the living room. As I walked into the room nothing was strange except for the large lump underneath the white throw blanket. I knew it was my little brother, so being the considerate, wonderful brother I am i figured I might as well scare him. I approached the blanket and he started laughing, I'd been caught. In a quick attempt to get him I wrapped my arms around the mass under the cover and yelled \"argh!\"\nNo response, no one under the blanket, I threw the blanket off the ground frantically and to my horror only the coarse carpet remained. I sat in shock for only a brief moment before the front door again swung open. My little brother, shuffled in and in a oblivious voice he asked,\n\"What's up jake?\"",

        "text": "Ok, first time posting here, so if this doesn't really belong in this sub please do forgive me.\n\nWhen I was younger, though I don't remember exactly how old, sometime in my teens because I was in high school I lived in a pretty crappy, ran down house with my parents.\n\nThe house had a reputation for being haunted, as two people had died in it, though neither were violent deaths. But I'm pretty sure what I experienced here wasn't anything supernatural. (Though even as an adult the basement of the place STILL creeped me out, and I'm not easily scared by things.)\n\nSo this night in particular I woke up at what I remember my clock saying was around 1am. I'd woken up to the sound of a loud POP! It sounded like an electrical breaker giving up the ghost and blowing a fuse, that's the best description I can give. But I remember it being VERY loud, and I'd woken up with my heart beating really fast and in a slight panic.\n\nI looked to the far end of my room to my TV cabinet, what I thought the only real source of some sort of electrical sound like this could be from in this small room. As the only electronics other than my little digital clock was my TV and a few game systems hooked up to it.\n\nThe strange thing is I remember seeing this faint \"gray\", for lack of a better term, glow coming from the TV screen. Like an afterglow of sorts, because it wasn't like an actual electronic glow. It was faint, almost like how glow in the dark toys look, but grayish instead of green like those.\n\nI remember smelling a pretty low-key, but foul smell in the room too. Like sizzled electronics, or burnt ozone. So, naturally I got up in a hurry and went to turn on my TV in the dark. I was (still am) a hardcore gamer and didn't have much in terms of money so I was worried my favorite possession just died. This was a nice TV, a pretty large Sony model. This was before HD TVs, so it was BIG, a cathode ray tube. It had been a hand me down from my dad when he'd gotten a large flat screen (these were fairly new at the time, again this is before HD) for the living room. I'd upgraded from an ancient Zennith (I don't even think this brand exists anylonger) 19 incher.\n\nThe TV seemed to be working, I fired up the game systems connected to it via an AV switch box, they all seemed to work fine as well. I remember once the initial shock of being woken up by this had started to wear off I was pretty damn tired as I guess I'd woken up in the middle of a sleep cycle.\n\nSo I was yawning and noticed the smell was gone, and I turned everything off, but the faint glow was still there. I remember kind of being creeped out by that as I lay back down to go back to sleep. I let it go, didn't think much of it. That was that.\n\n\nFast forward to about a year and a half, maybe even two years later I was playing an online game on PS2 one night, I think it was a Friday or Saturday night, because I wasn't in bed, I didn't need to wake up early the next day. A storm had been blowing over pretty good outside, this is the heart of winter, so it's pretty cold outside. \n\nSuddenly there's a explosion outside followed by the sound of something sputtering sparks. Everything goes black. The storm ended up being a severe ice storm and blowing out the power because frozen rain had coated the power lines outside and some of them had broken under the weight of the ice and the harsh winds.\n\nIt was a pretty bad storm almost everyone around us lost power, and plenty of folks even in other counties around us did as well. The power was out for about a week. \n\nWell when we finally did get power back on, it's like it always is after an outage, it comes back suddenly, unexpectedly and everything hums to life simultaneously. You hear microwaves beeping, clocks start flashing 12:00am, etc. So I go to check on my electronics in my room. \n\nI walk in and smell that electrical burning smell faintly and recall thinking it's weird, but never connecting the dots to that night a while back waking up to it.\n\nMy TV won't turn on, in fact nothing will. I look down and notice that my entire power strip seems to be blown, it's light not on now. I can see char marks around the plug to my TV. So I go rummaging around in my closet to pull out an older backup power strip, reset everything. The TV still wouldn't turn on, but all the game systems and the alarm clock worked.\n\nAs it turned out somehow the section of the power strip that the TV was plugged into blew out and it went straight through into the TV, which had been turned on when the power went out. I guess it blew out it's power switch, because it killed the TV.\n\nThis had really bummed me out, because I didn't have a backup TV, ended up having to borrow one from my uncle.\n\n\n\nNow in the present I look back and this and for the first time have sort of connected the dots between these two events. Something happened that night I woke up to the loud popping sound, and it left me really unnerved and unsettled at the time. For whatever reason I feel like I experienced a glitch that night. A precursor to the fate of my TV later down the line.\n\nWhat are your opinions?",

Before hand, we went to the Macs milk a few blocks away to get snacks, chips, pretzels, etc. I got a bottle of Coke with everything else. We paid for all of our crap, then started back to my place with the bags. Upon returning, I recall placing the Coke bottle on a shelf in my room, so that I would know where is for later. Keep in mind that my girlfriend hadnt entered my room yet, so she couldnt have stolen it. I left my room for a while, dont remember the reason, but when I returned to my room, the Coke bottle was gone. This really feaked me out, well, for the obvious reasons. However, my girlfriend and I carried on with our movie night, and that was that.\n\nMeanwhile, one day in April  I went to look for something in my shelf, and I saw a Coke bottle, still cold, and dripping with condensation, in the very same place I left that other Coke bottle before its apparent disappearance. I dont think I have ever been this freaked out by anything in my entire life. I mean, can an object disappear, and reappear nine months later in the same condition? Am I crazy? Or is there a possibility that my Coke bottle traveled into the future?\n\nDISCLAIMER: This post is probably riddled with typos, because I am using my phone to type all of this.",

I've been living the past few weeks in limbo as I have opened a new spiritual door (dimension, awakening, whatever) so I thought I was going crazy at first. \n\nHe had no recollection of the scar previously. It was quite noticeable and defined so it couldn't have just happened as it was also completely healed. ......?\n\nThen later in the night, we went out to dinner with a few friends. As we were all leaving I saw our friend walk to her OLD car. I was very confused because she had told us that her car had broken down about a month before and was getting a new one. I remembered her being very excited about that and when I saw her the time before this night she was driving her new silver jeep. I remember asking her \"is that your new car?\" And she said yes: \n\nWhen I asked her what happened to her new jeep she told me that she ended up never getting it, which confused me even more. I asked my boyfriend what happened and he said she never got it either. \n\nI'm super confused and/or crazy. Feedback? ",

No way for cars to come from another direction. \n\nI was kind of bored and observed the life going on outside the car. A woman with two children came out and headed to her car parked just to the front right of me. It was a beige Wolkswagen with a rather unique shade of beige. When she drove past me I noticed that the Wolkswagen logo at the back, which also serves as the access to the compartment, wasn't in its locked state. It flips to open and it was as if she hadn't quite shut the door completely. \n\nI followed her car with my eyes as she pulled out on the main road to the left. When I then went back to watching the store entrance, just a few seconds later the very same car goes by in front of me again. The same woman and two children in it. The child in the passenger seat putting a big fluffy piece of candy in her mouth as they pass by in the exact same way. The Wolkswagen logo half open just as before. I freezed and figured at first that I must've nodded off for a second or something but everything else going on outside the store was absolutely normal, including a dad walking slowly to the car while his children devoured their candy bags which took place during the entire incident. No jumps or repeats in any of these other activities going on. \n\nThere was no way for her to either have time, nor a way to do a u-turn and reenter the lot from the right. \n\nI still have no feasible explanation.

I was holding a cat (I do not own a cat) while two other people administered vet treatment or something similar, getting bitten multiple times in the process (I'm an animal lover, so that's kind of whatever to me).\n\n It's my understanding that you shouldn't be able to experience pain in a dream but it definitely hurt. While still dreaming, I remembered that you also shouldn't be able to count... so I went to count my fingers, and I could. \n\nThen, when I woke up I had two small, fresh scratches on my arm which were welted up exactly as my arm does with cat scratches. They're very thin and straight, and definitely not from anything I may have done to myself while sleeping. ",

Around the 2nd grade I somehow arrived at the idea that I could ask my dead ancestors to intervene on my behalf. I probably got this from watching too many episodes of Are You Afraid of the Dark or something.\n\nI remember mentally asking questions, mainly aimed at my long-dead grandfather who I had never met (I was a really weird kid.) At some point I came to the answer (or the answer came to me) that I could ask for an intervention, but that I would only get so many during my lifetime, and to use them wisely. I was so excited to try it out that one day on the playground I had to give it a go.\n\nIn elementary school you get a crazy spectrum of ages running around during recess. Some of the older kids are gonna take a swipe at the younger ones. Usually me and my friends were safe, but for some reason that day I felt uneasy. I didn't feel any specific threat, but something was off. So I asked the universe to help.\n\nThe bell rang, and my group began our unhappy walk back to class. Crossing that field takes forever when your legs are that little. Then about a third of the way across I heard a man's voice say, \"Raise your arm.\" My body moved before I could process it. My arm cocked up like a martial arts move and I began to turn to see what I should be blocking.\n\nAs I turned around WHAM! A soccer ball that had been punted at me by older kids bounced off my arm and into the field. I don't remember having had any trouble with these kids before, hell I didn't even recognize them. I remember trying to play it off cool, like I had meant to do that. I wanted to convince the older kids that I had lightning fast reflexes or something and that I wouldn't make a good victim. But as I looked around I realized that there were no adults at the rear of the field, no person who could've said those words to me in a clam low voice.\n\nDuring class my arm started to ache and I ended up with a pretty nasty blotchy bruise. If I hadn't raised my arm I would've taken the blow right to my head.\n\nI know this sounds like some half-assed attempt at creepypasta, but I'm telling you: This fucking happened to me. I still get uncomfortable thinking about it, hence the throwaway account.\n\nI'm not really religious today, but I sometimes wonder about that moment. Most days I dismiss it as a coincidence and childish thinking. I dunno, I guess I had to get this weird little incident off my chest.",

I should also preface buy saying my sister's boyfriend used to be a firefighter, and that is what he was training to do in tech school for the air force. Anyway, a few months pass and she finds a cloth fire fighter mask in the laundry with his name on it. Didn't really think anything of it thinking it must just be an old mask from when he was home, she just put it aside until he got home. This was a little over a week ago. After he came home a few days ago, she gave him his mask, he looked at it very confused and asked how she got it. She said she had just found it in laundry. But he's positive it's the same mask he was using at tech school, in which she was not visiting him during, because it had his rank on it. Not really sure how this mask which should still be at the base where his training took place, ended up in our house hold before he even returned home. He also didn't send her anything the entire time he was at school.\n\nTl;dr my sister's boyfriend's firefighters mask from the air force showed up in our household before he even came home. Nothing was sent to her either",

The story is, I was born in Italy to an upper class family. I was taught privately, and I inherited the family business.\n\n  The other story is  Iwas raised in Washington state, went to public school because my parents wanted me to be well equipped with life skills.\n\n  I was raised by my mother, and my father was not in the picture. My mother was also a drug addict, and my father a saint.\n\n  I could keep going, but I'll move on.\n\n  Growing up, I have very distinct memories. I know where I graduated high school, I know who my first kiss was, I know where my family vacationed in 2008.\n\n  I do not have a formal high school diploma, I have never physically met my first kiss, and my passport was never stamped from Australia.\n\n  I have memories that greatly conflict each other.\n\n  I remember my dad as an abusive alcoholic. I remember him as strict but caring. I remember him as dying when I was 6.\n\n  I know that most likely I am crazy, and the world I live in is the real world, my real world, but where have these vivid memories come from?\n\n  My theory on the matter is that at different points of my life, something has happened, and I have swapped places with a Lucitta from a different verse in the multiverse. Sometime the Luci I switch with has had the same life, except she had a blue first car isntead of white. Sometimes it's massive, such as my example about my dad.\n\n  As for the memories being jumbled, my theory is very unscientific, and just a wild theory. For some reason when we swap places, our consciousness stays behind, yet the brain we now have has previous memories, and slowly but surely my consciousness fills in blanks and tries to fit it all together.\n\n  I know, you're going to say I'm crazy, and I probably am. However, to me, this is a reality. I know I graduated from multiple high schools just as well as I know I am going to have to do a captcha to post this.\n\n  If anyone has any theories of their own on what is going on, please share them.\n\n  If this is happening to someone else, please message me.",

        "text": "Long story so bear with me. Back when I was 12 my father cheated on my mother with a 20 year old where he worked. My dad at the time was upset and resentful for obvious reasons and my mom took him back and all was well. Then he started acting strange. My dad would walk on our roof at 3 am because he swore people were laughing up there. He had signs in his car that said explicit things such as \"fuck my wife\" and talked openly about suicide and killing himself to my 5 year old sister and I at the time (something a 12 year old should never hear a parent talk about, or ever hear it). This weird behavior where he acted irrationally lasted for about 3 years and any therapy never worked. He lost so much weight that he wasn't recognizable (was a good 180 and dropped to around 140, big issue). He would always degrade my mom and ran away from home without his phone for 6 hours in the middle of the day while he was still openly discussing suicide. This day my mom told me that she had been trying to leave my dad since I was 5. Then one day at the end of my freshman year of high school I got a call from my sister (about 8ish at the time) and she was crying and obviously distressed telling me that our father was breaking and throwing things and packing up his stuff. Then one day he had to get a gall stone removed and everything changed. I know it was what people may call a traumatic experience but now it's like my middle school experience never existed. My parents only reference my life in middle school if talking about my old viola which I used to play. My dad never went to therapy during my freshman year and isn't on any medication that would make him not act out like he used to. He gained all his weight back (and some) and is known as the mellow and reserved dad. I don't know what happened. It's like no one remembers my father (or whatever else that was) acting irrational. I feel like something this big would obviously not be talked about by my parents (duh) but literally no other family member talks about this. Like not at reunions where gossip is pouring out of people's mouths or anything like that. Like the only way I can describe it is that it's almost like it never happened for my parents. Idk if it was maybe a switch or a possession or what could have possibly happened but I've been confused since. Please send help Reddit I'm open to anything and everything",

Nothing is blurry, so why would the area around my hair be just a blur? I wasn't moving when the picture was taken. Also, I dyed my hair, so not all of it is as dark as it looked in that picture.

On one side was our house and the other was what in Florida is called sugar sand (It was the foundation for the old railroad, you can still kick up metal railroad nails out there). It's very fine and very hard to even walk in, let alone drive. Anyway, on the opposite side of that road was forest. My friends and I would go through and cut trails into the woods far enough in until we found a spot with very few trees, then we'd clear it out to have little hangout spots. \n\nWe'd bring chairs and tarps, just stuff to make a campsite and get away from our parents for a little while. Well, One day we were headed out to one of the camps and I remembered that I forgot my flashlight, so I told the guys to go on ahead and I'd catch up. I ran back to get it and was back to the entrance of the trail in maybe 5 minutes. So I'm walking down the trail and all of a sudden the trail stops. I'm standing in a very wooded area and can't go forward anymore. I yelled to the guys and I heard them say they were at the camp, but I couldn't see where to go. We had just cut the trail the day before but for some reason it was overgrown. \n\nI turned around thinking I may have taken the wrong path, even though this was the only one we had cut in a while, and sure enough, just outside the trail was the orange piece of cord we tied to a tree to mark the spot. When I turned around, my friend Dave was standing behind me and scared the shit out of me. He asked me why I was so jumpy and laughed at me when I told him why. We took the exact same trail I just walked out of and it lead straight back to the camp. No overgrowth whatsoever. I still can't explain that. \n\nThe other story I want to tell you is about what we called \"Trickster.\" \n\nCertain things would happen in the house that always made us uncomfortable but we tried to laugh about it to keep from being creeped out. My Mom was kind of OCD about stacking dishes in the cupboards. The largest items would be on the bottom and they got stacked smaller as she went. Makes sense. Well, She would put dishes away and walk to the living room to watch TV and when she came back to the kitchen, the cupboards would be open with the dishes stacked with the smallest on the bottom and the largest bowl sitting upside down on top. \n\nAnother thing that would happen pretty frequently was that our dogs would be switched. \n\nWe had 2 Beagles at the time, a male and female. We had run lines for them that stretched a good distance for them in the back yard so they could play but still be separated. Well, we had taken them outside and put them on their run lines and about an hour went by. When we went outside to check on them, our female dog was on the male's run line and the male was running loose in the back yard. This happened about twice a week. \n\nAs I said, we eventually got creeped out enough to move out of that house, but a few years went by before we did. ",

I lurk around here a lot and decided to talk about my experience, even though it might not be that interesting. I also wasn't exactly there, so I'm only going off what I've been told. Let me know if I'm not in the right place, haha.\n\nMy parents had tried to have children many, many times before me, and each one had ended in miscarriage (I have something to say about later on but it's probably even less interesting). Before I was born, I believe they had had 3 or 4 miscarriages, and 1 after I was born. \n\nTechnically, I was also miscarried. My mom tells me that she was just getting a standard checkup on me. I'm not sure exactly how far along she was, but I believe it was relatively far. I was 100% dead; no heartbeat, no movement whatsoever. This was the case up until the day I was born (almost entirely healthy, though I was one month premature). I have always felt very connected to spirits and energies, and it shocked me when my parents told me about the circumstances of my bith.\n\nAdditionally, I also have a collection of drawings/\"letters\" I made when I was very, very young. They are all to my miscarried siblings and they are all addressed to them by name (my parents did not tell me what they would have named them). I have very little memory of my younger childhood but I do remember telling my parents each siblings' personality in detail, along with a memory of me (this is going to sound corny but bare with me) floating in a dark, red space, looking down at myself as a baby. The first bit may have just been some sort of coping mechanism, but it's still weird to me.\n\nWell that's my story! I hope it wasn't terribly boring. ",

        "text": "My original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlitchInTheMatrix/comments/4joiu9/train_station_remnant/) seemed to go okay, so I figured I'd tell you guys a bit more of what happened. \n\nWe had a driveway that went from the right side of the house, around through the back yard, and came out of the left side of the house, basically a U shape. Well, the left side of the house was where most people came in for some reason. It was made of something called shale which, for those of you that don't know is basically sand with small seashells in it. The rest of the driveway was mulch. Well when people would drive in, there would be shale from their tires that would overlap the mulch and you'd see tire tracks. This happened all the time and was just the way it was, tire tracks leading into the mulch. \n\nWell not long after the incident with dad seeing a kid in the house, we started noticing a bright yellow car, not quite as yellow as a taxi, more of a faded out shade, that would pull into the driveway. The car would pull in, but was never there when we walked outside to see who it was. This went on for months; every few days we'd see it from the window, so my dad started waiting on the back porch to see who it was. \n\nI was in the living room one night around 7pm, playing Nintendo (yes, it was that long ago) and saw the car pull in. Dad ran to the porch and I went to the bathroom where I could look out the window to see if the car backed out or not. I watched this car make the turn into our back yard like it was going to keep going, but my dad never saw the car at all. It was like the entire car vanished. To make it even more creepy, we got looking around in the back yard a few minutes later and not only was there no car, but there were no shale tire tracks either. There was no sign whatsoever that anything had ever been in our yard. ",

        "text": "When I was 10 we moved into a little house on the outskirts of town that had a very odd [layout](http://imgur.com/vVS3pV4). Every room had an exterior door (with windows) on it and a skeleton keyhole. I found out, years after the fact, that our house was actually the original train station for the town and had been decommissioned in the 1940's. At first I thought that was pretty interesting; I grew up in a place that was a historic landmark really. Then I thought about all of the odd things that happened and it made my hair stand on end. \n\nWe moved into the house, as I said, when I was 10. My dad was a Marine so we bounced from place to place but he finally settled on Florida and we were happy about that because we had spent a lot of time in the snow, so some sunshine was a welcome change.  Our first week in the house was what I'd like to tell you about now. \n\nMy dad, to this day will tell you this is a true story and it scares him to even tell it but I'll try my best to do it justice. I remember waking up on Saturday morning, still getting used to being in a new place, and walking into the dining room for breakfast. My dad, as usual was sitting reading the paper and when I walked out, he folded it up, set it on the table and waited for me to sit with my cereal. \n\n\"Son, who was your friend that stayed the night last night?\"\n\nThere was a bit of trepidation in his voice, which was something I wasn't used to. \n\n\"Umm, I don't have any real friends yet, Dad, there was no one here.\"\n\nTo this day, I've never seen that particular look on his face. I could tell right away he didn't believe me, but what really struck me was how nervous he seemed. \n\n\"Son, I know someone was here last night. He was in my room. If you're going to have friends over....\"\n\nMy Mom interrupted him. \n\n\"There was no one here last night, Bob. We've only been here a week. I'd have told you if anyone was staying the night.\"\n\nI sat, eating my Lucky Charms, not knowing what to think \n\n\"I know what I saw, Carla. There was definitely a boy in the house, and it wasn't our son.\"\n\nMom kind of shot him a look of \"Really, Bob?\" but Dad was adamant that someone was in the house. Looking back I understand that he wanted a logical explanation. \n\nThe way he tells it...well, I'll just quote him. \n\n\"This morning, around 3am, I woke up because I heard something fall. I thought it was one of the boxes that we had yet to unpack so I sat up turned on the lamp. Walking out of the closet was a boy, around 9 or 10 years old wearing a newsboy cap and a black jacket. When I turned the lamp on he looked me dead in the eyes and walked out of the room into (my) room. I got up and followed him and he walked into (my) closet and shut the door.\"\n\nThe unnerving thing is that we had just moved in. There were boxes, pretty large boxes, stacked in front of the walk in closet in my parents room. That, and my closet door was locked when we moved in. The landlord had to have a locksmith come out to get it open. What really gets me is that to get to my closet you had to walk right next to my bed. To this day I wont put my bed near a closet. \n\n\nA couple years ago I did some research and found out that a few deaths happened at that train station before it was bought out and the new train station was moved closer to town. One of the deaths was a little boy, around 9 years old, that fell in front of one of the trains and was killed. \n\nThis wasn't the only odd incident that happened in that house, but to be honest, we eventually moved because of the creepy things that happened there. \n\n ",

It's hard enough to describe.\n\nA couple of years ago, when I still lived at home, I had a huge picture frame - poster size - over the headboard of my double bed. One night I was asleep, on the left side of the bed as usual, when I suddenly became aware of my surroundings. It was like I was asleep - I still *knew* I was asleep - but still able to control my actions and perceive things - something that not only has never happened before (and never happened since), but I'd imagine myself incapable of doing it since I'm a really heavy sleeper. I was even aware of time passing, and knew that I remained in that state, unable to wake up, for a good 5-6 minutes.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, I feel like I *have* to turn over onto my side. So I do, bringing myself closer to the very edge of the bed - and almost immediately, I'm startled into full wakefulness by something hitting the bed next to me. For a few moments I just remember laying there and panicking, too scared to look. When I do, I see the picture frame - it fell down onto the bed a split second after I'd turned over, and the closest side to me is only about 5 cm from my side now. If I hadn't have followed that impulse to roll over, the picture frame would have fallen on me and probably broken my nose. I laugh when I talk to people about it and jokingly compare myself to the kids' book Flat Stanley but it still makes me a little nervous to think about even years later. Is this a glitch - that I knew I was in trouble even though I was asleep?",

        "text": "Last Thanksgiving break, I took a journey by train to visit my best friend at her dorm, the first chance I had to see her in a year. Being college students, I wanted to bring some weed with me, and another friend of mine (let's call her Lauren) lent me a purple weed container that was essentially smellproof, to help me get it there safely. The container had three parts; a part meant to store weed, a small grinder, and a lid. My trip isn't important to the story, but just to show I was familiar with the container.\n\nA month or so ago, I drive Lauren to a friend's house, and she brings a backpack with her. At the end of the night, I carry her to my car, drive her back home, and make the hour-long trek to my house. She wakes up at noon, missing her backpack and her shoes. Naturally, Lauren heads back to the friend's house, where she finds her pipe and the purple weed container, with weed inside, missing its lid. Lauren texts me, asking if her backpack and shoes were in my car, not mentioning the container at all.\n\nI walk out to my car to check, and find a pair of small black shoes on the floor, and Lauren's backpack on the back seat. I open the bag to see if her black jeans were inside, as she needed them for a play later that night. Next to them, I see the purple weed container, complete with lid. I open it to see if anything is inside to find that it's empty. This was odd, as she had a decent amount of weed the night before, but I just assume she worked her way through all of it. I text her back, telling her that I found her things. I remember thinking it was weird that I found the container but not her pipe, but I don't tell her that in case she thinks I was snooping through her bag. I drive back up later that night, see Lauren's play, and give her bag and shoes back to her.\n\nLast night, we sat around the living room, having a couple of drinks, when this night somehow comes up in conversation. Lauren tells me, for the first time, about going back to our friends house and finding her container and pipe, and then asking me about the rest of her stuff. I bring up the inconsistency, and both of us are completely baffled for the rest of the night.\n\nLauren still has the container, still missing its lid. It's a really minor thing to be caught up about, but we both remember our version of things incredibly vividly, and neither of us can offer an explanation for what happened. ",

Anyway...\n\nI have 2 separate occasions.\nThe first one was relayed to my by one of my close friends and her fiance at the time (they're now married, it's been a few years since this happened). They used to live in an apartment complex by me and at that time I drove a green Mercury cougar; my car was very distinct. So one night they are on their way back to their apartment and I guess they saw me in my car making a left onto the street I live on, which wouldn't be a big deal besides the fact that that night I was nowhere near my apartment at that time...I was on the complete opposite side of town for the night. A few things 1) I have lived in this neighborhood for years and have gotten to know people and what they drive over time; Ive never once seen another person with a green cougar like mine. Ever. And 2) her fiance was so certain it was me, he said the person driving the car looked identical to me and everything. So that's my first story which is weird but definitely not as weird as the second story...\n\nStory number 2:\nThis just happened a few weeks ago actually and freaked me out at the time. Now I guess I just think of it as a \"glitch\". \nI was at my parents house about to get into my car ( different car, no longer have the cougar) when I noticed one of the back doors was unlocked, I didn't feel like locking it for some reason ( I have manual locks) so I got into my car and reminded myself the whole way home to lock my back door when I reached my complex. This wouldn't even be a big deal but there's been too many break ins and I trust no one. Anyway,  I get to my apartment complex, turn off the car, turn around to lock the door and what do you know...its locked.  I was so freaked out by this because I am 100% positive that the door was unlocked, if it was locked I wouldn't have been reminding myself every 5 seconds to lock it... My first initial thought was that there was a ghost in my car or something, I don't know I was just freaked out, like I said before I have manual locks there's no way I would have been able to do it by accident. \nSorry if this is kind of long or if it seems minor to most stories posted on here but these events are significant to me because nothing like this ever happens to me...but here are a few of my experiences with parallel realities. I have a few other stories I could share but dont feel like typing and my phone is about to die",

(kind of related note : i want to work at hot topic and he wants to work at comics n stuff). at the time, i came up with a combination of people who could be her. one is his ex best friend (who i think is super hot) and a viner. it took me until a few days ago to find who she looks most like, and its a random cutie on facebook who i did not know at the time. i sent him a picture of her and he confirmed it could be her. possible prediction maybe? probably not. this freaked me out a bit but i hope someone finds this interesting and possibly some sort of explanation (if possible).",

        "text": "Been with my GF for three years now. She works at 6 AM during the week so we usually don't stay with each other except on weekends. \n\nThere has been another girl that I met about a year ago that I feel I have a pretty strong connection with. Occasionally, I have thought of what it would be like if I broke up with my girlfriend to try to date this other girl, but I love my girlfriend too much to do that. I did have some points last fall where our relationship got really difficult, and the thought of being with the other girl became very appealing. Things have since gotten better since then, and I'm confident I made the right choice sticking with my current girlfriend. You can say I'm shitty or whatever for potentially having feelings for someone else, but I'm not just going to toss someone who loves and cares about me to the side because I may have found someone who could turn out to be objectively \"better\".\n\nAnyways, the point of all of this, is that my girlfriend vaguely knows of the girl, but that's all. I think she has met her one time at an event, but she has no reason to think anything is going on, I have never talked about her, and my gf has never had any kind of insecurities about this girl.\n\nLast night, while my girlfriend was sleeping with me, I had a dream that seemed to last hours. It started around the present time, and I broke up with my girlfriend. After that, it was a general timeline of what happened after that. Obviously, my current girlfriend was upset and I struggled with it as well because I felt horrible. Eventually, we both got over it and my life with the other girl began. \n\nI woke up feeling very guilty about it even though I had no control over it, and she woke up soon after. She was very upset for some reason, and I asked her why. At first, she didn't want to talk about it, but eventually she told me about her dream. It was the same dream I had just had, from her perspective. The same events happened in the same manner, and it was the same girl. \n\nI'm still freaked out about it. As I mentioned, she would have no reason to suspect anything about this girl, I have never talked about the girl, the only thing she knows about the girl is that she exists. The dream just seemed to be too specific for both of us to have it on the same night while sleeping together. I'm starting to think we saw an alternate timeline where I did leave her for the other girl, but I don't know how plausible that is.",

I believed that it would be spectacular to do a burnout on the wet pavement, in a local neighborhood. So i sat at a stop sign to contemplate this notion when i decide that life is short and i should go for it. I slam on the gas and turn the steering wheel. My tires screech, as the black rubber was blissfully eaten away. I was about to straighten out, when i realise that my automatic 4wd was on. This was where i fucked up because at this moment all of the grip that my back tires had lost, was suddenly regained by my front ones. This sends me sailing toward a sturdy brick mailbox. It apeared as though dynamite had exploded within a 40 lb bag of flour. The mailbox was no longer recognisable as a mailbox, only gravel and fine dust from the shattered brick. feeling guilty and not wishing to deal with this trouble I decide, \"this is fucked, im going to come back tomorrow morning and fix this shit\". I then pull out and head home to find out that my truck had almost no damage, besides the paint being slightly scraped and the bumber dropping about an inch. When i return to the exact house that very next morning to fix what i had done, there was a perfectly well built brick mailbox set up in there yard. Not only was it perfectly built and dry, but there were no traces that another mailbox had fallen. Feeling skeptical, I drive down the road several times to make sure i wasnt mistaken and found the wrong house, but it indeed was the right house. It was strange, almost as if they had kept a spare mailbox in their garage in case this might happen.\n   ",

There was a huge room with metal walls and metal pillars were pounding on the floor at different rates. It was so loud it sounded quiet to me. Then I would see a little girl in a pink dress walking around the big metal room and leaving flowers wherever she stepped. I remember hearing a tinkling noise like bells with every step she took, but it was so quiet it seemed loud to me. I remember always feeling like the girl was in trouble, and the metal pillars were so angry and dark and that they were going to hurt her. \nI brought up this weird dream to my sisters around 10 years later, and after relaying it to them they just stared at me and told me they had eerily similar dreams at different points in their lives. The dreams were all slightly different but shared the same thing: big metal pillars pounding, so loud it seemed quiet, and a little girl in pink that produced a tinkling sound when she walked, that was so quiet it seemed loud. We were all totally freaked out and didn't really discuss it any further, and to this day my sister won't talk to me about it because it scares her so much. \nIs there some kind of scientific explanation to these weird shared dreams? If we had had them all at the same time I would chalk it up to something in our environment that triggered the dreams, but we had these dreams years apart from each other. \nThis has been bothering me for years, and I don't think I'll ever have a real answer, but I thought getting an outsider's input would shed some light on it.

        "text": "Well over a year ago I got a tattoo on my left arm between my wrist and elbow. It's an orange, red and black geometric shape, not very big but my arm is tiny so looks big on me. This tattoo means a lot to me and I was planning on getting it for a very long time before I finally did, for some reason I was always convinced I wanted it on my left arm, not right. Now a fact that might play some importance in this is that sometimes the black parts of the tattoo get bumpy and itchy, might be something to do with the weather or an allergy or something, not sure, never been a big problem. Last night I got home from my part time job, tired as usual, straight to bed. As I was falling asleep my right arm kept itching the same way my tattoo sometimes itches, at the same spot the tattoo is on on my left arm, and my half-asleep brain kept thinking it was the tattoo but I kept reminding myself it was the wrong arm. I soon fell asleep and forgot about it.\n\nToday I got up, got dressed, went to uni, came home, got on my laptop and put on a warm jumper because it gets cold in my room. Didn't pay attention to the tattoo any more than I usually would since I don't really think about it much, it's just a part of me now. At some point my right arm started itching again, I pulled up the sleeve of my jumper and there it was, my fucking tattoo. Neatly between my wrist and elbow, on my right arm. Checked my left arm, nothing there. Naturally I'm pretty fucking freaked out at this point, but it gets worse. I remember I uploaded a pic of it on Facebook when I first got the tattoo, I was sat on my bed in my old room facing the window and in the pic you can see my legs on the bed with my arm stretched out on top of them, with the wall on my left side next to my arm. I go to find this photo, and it's not how I remembered at all. It's now my right arm in the photo, and I'm sat facing the back wall of my room, my back turned to the window, so the wall is now on my right side.\n\nI casually asked my housemates if they knew which arm my tattoo was on but they weren't very helpful, all of them just said they weren't sure. To be fair thinking about it now I don't remember which arm any of my tattooed friends' tattoos are. I don't know if it could just be my mind playing tricks on me? I either forgot where I got my tattoo nearly two years ago or it switched arms, and neither of those options sound very normal.",

        "text": "Before I tell my story I wanted to mention that I was almost 100% sure that I suffered some sort of memory loss from this event but I was told by my doctor that it would have been unlikely to have lasted an entire day, especially without being in a state of confusion / seeming off to others.\n\nI've been a pretty good swimmer all my life. I was enrolled in lessons at a very young age and continued right up to Life Saving level 1 before quitting due to an age restriction. For the past several years, it's been a tradition in my circle of friends to spend the last weekend in August up at the cottage. This cottage, along with the surrounding cottages, are all on their own mini islands and require a boat to get to. One August weekend, I woke up really hungover from the night before and, although it's the LAST thing in the world you'd want to do with a terrible hangover, I've always found that hard exercise the morning after is great for getting rid of my hangover. Normally, if I was hungover, I would stay close to shore and swim laps for half an hour or so before heading back to land. On this particular day, I had woken up pretty early and knew it would be a few hours before anyone else was awake so I stupidly decided to swim to a nearby island which usually took around 40 minutes to get to if I was in a sober state. \n\nSo I headed out across the lake and eventually made it to the island, took a breather, and started to swim back. I was extremely close to the shoreline of the cottage when I got a REALLY intense cramp in my left leg and it hurt like hell to move it. I started panicking and yelling for help and luckily, some of the others in the cottage had woken up and one of them ran into the water to get me. I remember having an extremely vivid dream that I woke up in a suburban two story house, got dressed and went down to eat breakfast with my wife, Caroline. I had a toasted english muffin with herb &amp; garlic cream cheese and a coffee while we talked about Lisa's birthday, I'm not really sure who that was. I ended up kissing her goodbye and going to work at a news company called Newshub which I've never heard of before. \n\nThe next thing I remember, is waking up at my friends cottage. It was 10am and I walked into the kitchen and asked everyone what had happened after the accident in the lake. They all gave me a confused stare. Apparently, my friend has pulled me out of the water while I was unconscious and administered CPR. I had came to and after thanking him for saving my life convinced everyone I was fine and that everything was ok and I didn't need medical attention. According to everyone else, I seemed normal and didn't show any signs of being off in any way. I'm told I continued on with my day where we sat around, went fishing from the dock, and made dinner. I DON'T REMEMBER ANY OF THIS. Like I mentioned earlier, I had chalked this up to memory loss which is possible after drowning but I was told my by doctor that it's unlikely I could have forgot an entire day AFTER waking up. For some bizarre reason, that entire day I spent with my friends after coming to, in my mind, was replaced with that strange dream I had. This is something that has really got me stumped. I don't see how I could have gone on autopilot for the better part of a day and not remembered a thing about it. I figured I'd at least have looked a little off in some way to my friends if there was something medically wrong with me but they all said I seemed completely fine and was cracking jokes / having conversations. Does anyone have some sort of medical explanation for this? is it possible the doctor could be wrong?\n\nTL;DR: Drowned, was given CPR and after coming to, continued on with my day which I have no memory of.",
