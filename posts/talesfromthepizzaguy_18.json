        "text": "Recently started delivering for Dominoes. Tonight I had an order for 2 large meat lovers pizza for delivery just around the block. So I drive up to the address on a dead end street and a strange man sitting in his car flags me down. The only house on this road was a cabin deep in the woods. So I figured this guy just waited for me down at the end of his driveway to make it easier.\n\nI go up to his car and give him his pizzas and drinks. He tips me well and everything goes smoothly. I drive off when my boss calls me and tells me that the man called the store to say he never got the dipping sauces he paid for. Luckily I have sauces in my car for situations like these so I toss some blue cheese and mango habanero in a bag and drive back to the creepy road guy.\n\nWhen I pull up he's still in the same spot so I just drive up to his window to hand him the sauces. Then I notice that his face is full of sauce and cheese and can see that he already demolished one of the pizzas in the span of 8 minutes.\n\nI ask him \"why you eating in your car man?\" He then says \"don't ask questions you don't want to know the answer to.\" I nope the fuck out of there and pray that I don't have to ever deliver to that man again.",

Firstly there is no light illuminating the sign to the neighborhood entrance. You approach it just coming off of a curve so it's easy to miss. There is no HOA so there is no one to complain to about this. Secondly since we live in the county our street has zero street lights so it's dark as fuck outside. Thirdly (this is actually something I can fix) we have no house numbers. In fact very few houses in the neighborhood have them. I can easily put some up though. After realizing this I figured it would be best to get take out instead of delivery. We have a PJ's near us but I'm not sure if we're in their delivery zone since we're outside city limits.  So I will not burden pizza folks with trying to find our house.",

This dude is known through out the store as he refuses to tip.  I take the .90 and straight faced thanked him turned took 1 step and chunked his change off the 3rd floor. Door hadn't even closed. IDK if he saw but I didn't care.  Last time I delivered to him he gave me $5 in nickles and dimes w/o tipping. \n\n2nd Incident came at 1130pm! 2 ladies come walking in 30 minutes past close, lights were off and open signed turned off and the manager and driver refused to kick them out, as they didn't want to be rude.  Manager came back and asked me what to do.  I walked out and politely asked them to leave. They proceeded to claim \"well your door was unlocked, why can't we order\". We have 1 door for drivers, same as carryout.  Well can't you just deliver to the parking lot, same thing as parks(depending on if we like you) NO, we need physical address and proceed to escort them out and lock door behind them. ",

At this point I have one guy standing pretty close behind me, and one guy (the one paying) in front. Out of habit, I glance back at my car as he's counting out the money, and I see the third guy circling my car. When the third guy notices I'm looking at him, he suddenly pulls out his phone and holds it up to the building as if he's trying to take a picture all of a sudden. Almost like he was trying to cover for the fact that he was walking around my car.

You know, the ones that you'll probably use in about two seconds. Well, I hated that price, so a lot of times I'd just give it to the person for free. In my mind, if someone asked what happened to one or two dipping cups, I'd pay the dollar or so, if the manager cared enough.\n\nSo, I was driving out to a small trailer park, and saw a couple waving me down. They were both really nice and energetic people, but the woman mentioned that fact that they didn't have their sauces, and after I asked listed off what they had ordered (which they had indeed ordered). I sighed and apologized immensely and told them I'd be back. I got back to the store and there was no deliveries waiting, and no orders on the screen, and it generally was just slow (it was around 11).\n\nI forgot the exact amount of sauce cups, but knew they ordered four blu cheeses, so I got a bag, tossed four of everything in it, and hit the road. I pulled up, and the couple kept thanking me. According to them, their sauces got forgotten all the time and I was the first driver to come back.\n\nAll in all, they seemed like cool people, and the opinion didn't change when I returned another day and found them giving me a pretty decent tip.",

        "text": "Obligatory not a driver (only on certain occasions) and not a pizza deliverer (we deliver sandwiches).\n\nSo I'm night shift manager of a sandwich chain that operates til 3am at our location. We get a call at 2:40am from a woman who has called before, I pick it up. \n\nHere's some background info on this woman, she talks A LOT, for a LONG TIME, and doesn't give you room to talk or butt in. She has called before, leaving me on the phone for AN HOUR talking to me about how great our service is and how thankful she is for us being open late. I was bashing my brains in the whole call. From what I can tell, she sounds older, because she talks slow. She has a son (I know this because she's told me on the phone) that comes in a good amount of times a week, 2 minutes before close and asks for one of our special meal boxes that involve a lot of work, and it obviously pisses us off. \n\nThe first thing she says on call is \"Can I have your name?\"\nBad start. I give her my name and ask what I can help her with, here's the convo: (\"W\" for \"woman\", M\" for me) these are not actual quotes unless in quotations\n\nM: What can I help you with?\nW: First of all, I'm recording this conversation to send to corporate, because they told me a different thing than what someone did yesterday. Corporate said we can deliver outside of the delivery zone, but someone at your store said that we can't. I live a block away from \"x street\" (our north cut out end) and I just wanted a delivery tonight and I wanted to know if you can make an acceptation and deliver outside of it for tonight. \nM: I'm sorry m'am, but I don't have the answer for you right now. That's for the general manager to decide on, and I don't want to break a rule tonight. From what I know, orders over $50 can be sent anywhere in town. I can set up a pick up order for you tonight but you'll have to get here soon because we lock doors at three. But you're going to have to wait on that delivery until I'm able to ask the general manager tomorrow about our policy on delivery zones. \nW: I do not want a pick up order I want delivery tonight. Could you please make an acception for me? I have my son come in almost every night and buy two special boxes and it comes over $25 in total. *begging ensues* \nM: I'm sorry, I don't feel comfortable breaking a rule tonight. You will have to wait until tomorrow and call, or do a pickup order. \nW: *begging continues* Please, I'll even pay double the delivery fee. Is there a manager there I can speak to?\n\nWell here's where the problem comes in where I'm not so sure about on my part. I say no, but I am the manager. But I've only been manager for less than a week. I was never trained on this situation, I've only been working at this location for not even two months. I didn't want to say \"yes, I am the manager\" because I mean, I don't really have the knowledge of a manager or awareness of any sort of customer feedback training stuff. So I said no, and she paused for a bit and said something along the lines of that being a problem, and that's when it hit me that she was still recording this for corporate and corporate will hear that and thing we don't have a night shift manager when we do and it's me. \n\nSo after that happens she begs one more time. I was annoyed, it was 5 minutes til close and there was two customers up front. I wanted to end the call. I basically was tired and wanted to be done at the point so this is what I said,\n\nM: \"Well, it's 5 minutes until closing, by the time we make your two special boxes it will be past three, and by the time it's delivered it will be past about 3:10. (I start to bullshit at this point) I can't have the delivery driver out past 3:10 because of safety and management reasons of having the doors unlocked past 3am. I'm sorry about this but I just can't send out a driver past closing time, and I can't delivery to your area for tonight regardless.\"\n\nAnd this is what she said that scared me,\n\nW: \"Alright. That's all I needed to hear. Thanks.\" \n\nand then hung up.\n\nWell, did I fuck up? Will corporate kill me off? Should I had said yes? \n\nGod help me, I've only been a shift manager for 3 days and this happens. ",

It was rush hour, and I was crossing [street coming straight up from highway], aiming for [Lazy alley type street]. Look right in direction of highway (have to look through SUV windows owned by other drivers, I see nothing) Also, if I poke my engine out I will get clipped if I'm not quick. With the best of my ability and judgement I take the opening, which looks clear meaning that the few seconds of red light has engaged. Clean getaway? Sadly, no.\n\nSedan smacks Blizzard. **Hard.** $XXXX in damage hard. Didn't have enough insurance coverage, so I have to make an expensive choice. Save up and repair? Get a new one? Blizzard can't stay like this.\n\nPlease be careful. Because you are out on the road much more means that not only does your vehicle wear more, it's more likely you will be in an accident. Get full coverage. I just did now, and my bill is double. Your car is also your work space, like a cubicle moving down the street at an average of 30 mph. Take safe but longer routes during rush hour, and the quicker ones while it slows down. I am reminded of this every single day.\n\n**TL;DR: Be more careful than the average driver**",

        "text": "Currently I'm working at a pizza place that I started at a year after high school and quit shortly after. Now I'm back 3 years later. At the end of the night if we have more than two full leftover pizzas that haven't gone out on the buffet we  box them up and will donate it to one of the local hospitals. \n\nTonight we had 4 large pizzas that were to be delivered to a local emergency room.\n\nBefore I arrived an ambulance had just pulled up to the entrance and the nurses rushed a patient inside. The place was also packed with cars in the parking lot, so you could assume it was a hellish night so far for all of the staff.\n\nWhen I entered the check-in area I could see a visibly stressed nurse with a phone to her ear. Shortly after seeing me she hung up the phone and asked what I could do for her.\n\n\"Ma'am I have a couple of pizzas here for all you fine folks busting your butts tonight, courtesy of my work.\" (actual name not listed for obvious reasons)\n\nHer face just lit up with a bright smile as she told me, \"You just made my night.\" She went on to talk about how crazy it's been and how they were understaffed. She claimed that the pizza would be a great boost to moral early on during a long night. \n\nIt's little moments like this that let me love my job and make me wish I could do it more often. Sometimes I think about putting more pizzas into the oven before close just to put a smile on someone's face with a fresh pie instead of one that's been sitting for a while. God knows ER staffers deserve it more than anyone else. ",

Instead of driving straight home I parked under the Valero gas station awning right next to my store. I ran inside to get some napkins and left my car running. I say hi to my old Indian friend behind the counter and start pulling napkins out of the dispenser. I have a bunch of napkins in my left hand when suddenly the door flies open and two men run in. I think, wow these guys are acting rowdy. Why is that guy jumping on the counter?.... Then I saw they both had guns and were totally robbing the place. I stood there like a good hostage and put my hands in the air and just staired at the drink fountains. They got the tills and left quickly. \n\nMy pupils are the size of pin drops right now. I feel weird. I just had to tell fellow pizza people while the adrenaline goes away.\n\nEdit: Some typos and pin drops are not a measurement of size... ",

        "text": "I recently made a delivery to a beach club and as per my restaurant and beach clubs rules, I am not allowed to walk to the customers cabana and they must meet me in the lobby. 90% of customers are understanding. So I do my thing and call the customer when I am two mins away so I don't have to sit around waiting. No answer. I get to the driveway outside the lobby. No answer again. Wait two mins. No answer again. Wait two more mins. Walk inside the lobby to see if the customer is there or their is someone at the front desk. Nope. I repeated the calling and waiting process for 10 more mins before I was called back to pick up another delivery and also explained that I am bringing this order back to the restaurant and left the customer a message to call me or the restaurant. \nNow it's important to mention that this beach club is 25 mins out of the way of literally every other delivery I can possibly make and I hate going here. So Im making my journey back to the restaurant and I am almost there when I get a call from the customer asking where there food is. I apologized (because I totally meant it) and explained that I waited and called multiple times. The customer then bitched me out about how the order says it was to be delivered at 5:45 and I was there at 5:20. I politely explained to the customer that the GrubHub order clearly says delivery BY 5:45 and not AT 5:45 and I am sorry they their order was 25 mins early but I would be glad to bring their order back, but they would have to wait a bit as I have other deliveries to make now. (I had 4 waiting in the store for me and was walking in) or they can come pick it up (the faster option but the wanted delivery so I don't blame them). The customer began to yell at me and call me retarded and that I need to bring them their order first. The whole time, I was very calm, but someone shaken up and proceeded to tell the customer that I am very sorry, but I am only doing my job and will be there as soon as I can, but they are very far away, so they have to work with me because I am only human. I got called retarded again and they hung up. Needless to say, I am almost positive they got blacklisted and my boss would rather lose a customer than let his staff be treated like shit. \n\nAlso, still got my prepaid tip and my boss said he would deal with the customer so I don't even know if it was delivered. $10 tip whooooooo",

Because of that, their systems were complete garbage- we would be unable to clock in for hours on end.\n\nBut the worst bit was that the zip code took priority over the address.\n\nWe would frequently get delivery orders from people past the next store over. And every time, it always went the same way.\n\n* The delivery mapping system took you to an empty patch of land. It was literally a bunch of trees. No matter what the address actually was, it always took you to that exact spot.\n\n* The street name changed between the printed map system and the delivery. On the delivery it said (name) Street, while the map said (name) Street Road. Which was, in fact, an actual road... in a different city.\n\nSo the end result the first time it happened was an hour of searching around the supposed location, trying to use my GPS to get to the supposed location before realizing how far away it was, and then putting the actual location in and realizing it was half an hour away in the opposite direction.\n\nOn my way there, I actually passed a delivery car from the other location.\n\nThe worst part is that these orders *kept on coming*. Every month or so we got a new order from these idiots using the wrong zip code. Every month or so, the managers told them the problem and to redo their order with the proper zip code.",

And each one would almost always do the following:\n\n* Tip badly if at all\n\n* Take up to five minutes to either let me in the building (yeah, that's right, one of them also had electronic door locks, so I had to page them not only to let me inside the neighborhood, but to either let me inside the building or come and get their food. Usually the latter)\n\n* Never give me the correct gate code.\n\nThat last one is the worst part. Because these gated communities are huge, super hard to navigate, and change their gate code daily. So the customer gives me the wrong code, and instead of opening the gate, it calls some random person. When I call them on the phone to confirm the code, they assure me it's the right one. I had been convinced that the gate's pound key was broken for half a year because of those people!\n\nAnd the worst part is, the front office is only open for four hours every weekday. So when they order dinner, I can't get them to open it for me. So I have to walk a mile just to get them their stuff.\n\nAnd when the food is late and I'm clearly exhausted, and I had made it clear that their gate code didn't work, they get mad at me.",

        "text": "I've been wanting to rant about this guy for a while. This dude is one of the few regulars I have that I actually dread getting because all the little issues involved with his order. Allow me to list the routine that happens every time, without fail.               \n\n1. The guy lives far as fuck away, basically as far as you can get on our delivery radius. This and the combination of roads it takes to get there make getting there a complete drag. *Obviously* this detail isn't his fault, but it's the first annoying thing.             \n              \n2. I drive there and punch in his gate code. It's one of those gates that calls their phone and they buzz you in. **He never answers his god damn phone to open the gate.** **Never.**                   \n               \n3. I call his number that's on the ticket. It's, of course, the same number that the gate uses, so, of course, he doesn't answer that either. (I don't even do this step any more because it's literally the same shit every time. He never answers it.)                  \n\n4. Thanks to our (vague, nonspecific and arbitrary) company policy, I can't just bounce. I have to sit there and wait for someone else to come along and open the gate.                 \n\n5. I drive around to his building, ring the bell, and he makes me wait there *FOREVER*. Okay not forever, but up to 5 minutes just standing there while I hear curses and shouting from inside and \"ONE MINUTE\"s. If someone has a good excuse for why it takes a while to get to the door- fine. But this is all on top of the other inconveniences.                 \n\n6. Without fail he'll have some rude or snide comment/joke (or something about how dangerous his dogs are), and he'll hand me a single dollar bill from his change and act as if he's so generous.                   \n                \nLiterally EVERY TIME without fail it's been those exact steps.               \n\nI tried to get him blacklisted, believe me. I even used my trip odometer to show that, once I park outside his building, he's technically 0.2 miles past our delivery radius. I even brought up the waiting at the gate issue with multiple managers, but it's always \"someone will come along soon enough so just wait\".            \n               \nSo anyway, rant over. Just fuck that dude. All I can do to get back at him is not take turns as slowly as I usually do with food in the back. I HOPE YOUR RAVIOLI IS SLIGHTLY SHOOK UP, DICKHEAD.",

        "text": "November of 1999.  I drove for Domino's in Cherokee, NC.  Y2K was drawing near.  There was an incredible amount of hype and fear that all of the computer dates were going to roll from 1999 to 1900 and the end of the world would be swiftly upon us.  This event made the 2012 Mayan Calendar thing look like a day at the park.\n\nI worked for the most laid-back, easy-going, go-with-the-flow owner that ever existed.  He was a x-th degree black belt in whatever-martial-arts....  and you knew he was *actually* good at it because he never bragged or talked incessantly about it (we all know THAT guy).  We're going to call him Bruce.  \n\nSometimes, you'd be walking out of the walk-in freezer, or turning around from taking an order from the phone and *WHIFFFF* you felt a breeze past your nose, only to see that Bruce had kicked merely inches from your face as he finished his pivot on one foot and laughed at your confusion.  He was so awesome.\n\nYou always knew when Bruce was working because the pizzas would come out EXACTLY the same.  Perfectly rounded, sized, and topped.  He would be simultaneously making pies and pulling them from the oven to be boxed without ever missing a beat.  I don't think I ever saw a pizza make it so far as the oven's conveyor belt stopper under his watch.  He ran a completely smooth operation.\n\nDid I mention he was laid back?  Nothing ever got under this guy's skin.  He was the most humble guy I've ever met.  To a fault, IMO.    It was a little annoying at times, because customers and employees would often take advantage of his gentle nature and he would let them do it without any confrontation.  I asked him one day, after an encounter with an angry customer, why he lets people walk all over him.  He said, \"When I was younger, I nearly killed someone in a pointless fight, and since then, I'm terrified of letting it escalate to that point.\"  So much respect.\n\nThere was a banner Message of the Day on all of our order taking terminals.  It had never been changed as long as I could remember.  It said \"UPSELL CHEESY BREAD!!\"  I thought it would be hilarious to change the message.  The only thing I needed was the 4 digit manager's pin.  I watched Bruce's fingers as he checked me out for the night and saw him punch in his pin.  I made a mental note.  Now, what to write?\n\nThe next day, as I remembered my plan and the pin, I went to the terminal and selected the option to change the Banner MOTD.  It asked for the pin, to which I obliged.  I pondered for a second, then it hit me...  Jackpot.  I used all caps for emphasis:  \"WARNING:  THIS COMPUTER IS NOT Y2K COMPLIANT!\"  Now we wait, have a few laughs, then change it back.  No harm, no foul.\n\nIt went largely unnoticed for most of the evening.  Many deliveries went by, nothing.  I pretty much had forgotten about it until I came back from a delivery and a devastating scene unfolded before me.\n\nPizzas were piled up at the conveyor belt stopper and backing up into the oven.  The store was in chaos.  And poor Bruce.  His face was beet red, and the front of his hair had a cowlick from where he had been pulling it over and over while yelling over the phone at Corporate trying to figure out what was going on.\n\nOnce I realized what was happening, I walked over to Bruce and pressed the button to hang up the phone.  He looked at me inquisitively with crazy wild eyes and labored breathing as I showed him what I had done trying really hard not to laugh--but at the same time, terrified for my life after seeing him pushed so far to the edge.  We got the store back in order, THEN we laughed.\n\nI ran into Bruce a couple of years after I left Domino's to pursue an IT career.  It turns out the entire system had crashed about a month after I left and had to be replaced--and I honestly had nothing to do with it.  But to this day, even 17 years later, every time we run into each other, he squints his eyes and points at me and says \"I know it was you.\"\n\n",

        "text": "It was late night on a Saturday and business began slowing down. The phone rings and I answer, going through the same script I had many times before. In a deep, raspy voice I hear the customer ask for delivery and provide the address. I immediately notice that the address is on an industrial back road, exclusively lined with factories and businesses. I didn't think much of it, assuming that someone from a company was ordering food for a late night shift. 15 minutes later I bag the order and leave the store.\n\nAs I approached the destination, I decided that there was a mistake. To my left was a small gravel lot, filled almost exclusively with shipping containers and old trucks. There were two abandoned mobile homes sitting by the road, and a long warehouse towards the back. Finally, resting all the way in the back near a field, there was an extremely small and dilapidated metal mobile home.\n\nI pulled my car right in the middle of the gravel lot and stepped out into the cold night. Everything was pitch black and there were no numbers posted on any of the buildings. I call the customer to ascertain whether or not I was in the correct location. Again, the same deep, raspy voice answers.\n\nMe: \"Hey there, this is JWho1337 with Donatos, I was calling because my GPS had me pull into a gravel lot down the street from the Marathon gas station and I don't think this is the correct location.\"\n\nCustomer: \"Oh, no you're in the right place. I'll be right out!\"\n\nAgain, I must reiterate that the customer's voice was very deep and I assumed them to be a big, burly man. In my head, I established that the customer must be working a late shift and will probably be coming out of the warehouse. Accordingly, I began walking towards it. As I approach closer, I'm surprised to hear a distant creaking noise from behind me. I turn and see the tiny tin mobile home’s door swing open, and a frail silhouette begins walking towards me.\n\nImmediately this puts me on edge as this person approaching me looks nothing like the customer I expected to see, so I try to break the ice by saying hello. My voice cuts through the night air and is immediately drowned out by silence. The silhouette comes closer and I can now see an old, frail woman limping towards me. She doesn't respond.\n\nI back up slightly and try again, asking them if they had ordered food. No response. This is when I genuinely felt my fight or flight senses kicking in. A huge chill unlike anything I had felt before flooded my body, and I began contemplating whether or not I should haul ass or beat up this old woman.\n\nFinally, as she got closer, she responded, \"Yes… I ordered food\" in that familiar deep and raspy voice. A wave of relief washed over me and I told her that her total was $28. She handed me two $20 bills. When I asked her how much change she would like, she stumbled for a moment and then told me that she didn't need any.\n\nYou don't have to tell me twice. I handed her the pizza and walked to my car. My legs were jelly at this point but I was extremely relieved that nothing bad happened. In hindsight, I overreacted in the moment. The lady was completely innocent, and here I am contemplating whether or not I should hit her with a stone cold RKO or run off with her food. \n\nThis is by far the creepiest experience I’ve ever had on a delivery, hope you enjoyed. \n\n\n \n",

I place the order online, done and done. Not even 30 seconds later she messages me back, changing her mind, wanting to get a different deal. I admit, I was a little frustrated (former pizza employee, fwiw) and I called them up to change the order. Here's how it went down:\n\nEmployee: \"Thank you for calling {pizza place} at {location}, is this for delivery or carryout?\"\n\nMe: \"Hi, I just placed an order online, and I was wondering if it's too late to change it...\" (give my details)\n\nEmployee: (clearly annoyed) *exasperated sigh* \"Yeah, I guess, but I'm already halfway done with making it.\"\n\nMe: \"You know what, never mind, it's my mistake, I'm so sorry for the inconvenience, my wife decided to change her damn mind right after I ordered it, you know, like women like to do.\" (Note: the employee is female)\n\nEmployee: *chuckles* \"It's okay, I understand, and yeah, no comment on that last part you said!\"\n\nMe: \"Would it be too much trouble to add a pizza to that order? Just a 2 topping medium.\"\n\nEmployee: \"Sure, no problem, and just to let you know, since it's a different size than what you originally ordered, it's not eligible for the deal.\"\n\nMe: \"Eh, that's fine, my mistake anyway.\"\n\nEmployee: \"\"Wait, you know what? I'll just punch it in as part of our promotion, and I'll even put in an employee discount. At this time of night, I rarely get someone who is nice, and sober, and I really can't tell you how much I appreciate that.\"\n\nMe: \"Thank you, I really appreciate that ma'am, I did not need that, but thank you! I used to do this for a living, so I know exactly what it's like to be treated like dirt. I promised I would never do that to another fellow service worker. You guys are awesome for all of the crap you put up with!\"\n\nShe is taken back by this, we end the call, and I arrive there in a few minutes. I walk in, she greets me, I greet her back and she very excitedly shows me the pizzas, rings me up, and I pay. \n\nI tell her to have a good night, and as I leave, she exclaims,\" Wait!!! Feel free to take a 2-liter with you. And I have an order that hasn't been picked up in an hour and the guy won't answer. It's yours if you'd like.\"\n\nI gladly accept, and I go home with 6 pizzas, a 2 liter, and a sandwich, all for $18. All just for being nice. \n\n(I'm aware that she probably would've just given those to whoever else may have walked in, but I choose to believe she did that on account of my handling of the situation.)",

Not that I necessarily agree with this fee, but I (and my co-workers) make sure to tell all customers  in advance to ensure there's no complications that arise due to people not being aware of it. Anyways, last week it's a bit busy and I get back from an order only to see the screen completely full  which kinda freaked me out. It wasn't uncommon for it to happen, but I noticed the other driver had been gone for well over 45 mins which should rarely ever occur. I go over to the managers office and ask him where the hell the other guys at and he explains a customer sent back a $60 order because he flat out refused to pay the extra $2 surcharge which really pissed me off. Not only did it hold me up, but by the time it was worked out the next delivery took around 45 mins to get the next customer who had ordered. After explaining the situation to the other customer he laughed and said \"he should make his own fucking pizza then\" and left a pretty decent tip. Overall a pretty good night but it just really bothers me how wasteful and ignorant some people can be. ",

Arriving home just as you are about to shit yourself, seeing the car in front of you get caught by a speed camera you didn't know existed, finding the love of your life (admittedly that one is an assumption), and coming back to the store to find a ticket for Martha Webber up when its your turn to deliver. \n\nIn many ways, Martha Webber is the best and the worst. The one-eyed elderly woman has been a loyal and constant customer. For the longest time she always, no matter what, tipped $10. When we got hand-held credit card machines, she couldn't handle the technology so the man she lives with (Son, brother, husband, nobody knows) handles credit card transactions. Now Male Webber managed to outdo his solo-eyed roommate. He tips $20 on every order, no matter how much the total is. So if you are fortunate enough to go there, you know you're leaving with $10 at worst, and $20 if they're not paying in cash. It honestly will make your whole shift. \n\nBut with that sort of consistency comes greed. The hideous five letter word that we all have inside of us and try to suppress to varying degrees. Martha Webber threatens to tear the brotherhood of drivers at my store apart. So powerful is her draw that us drivers resort to unsavory methods to feast our eyes on her. Locking other drivers in the bathroom, taking her order with others going the opposite way, stabbings, an unconfirmed shooting. Once a plague rat was set loose in a driver's car just to keep him occupied as I-er, I mean the perpetrator- escaped with her order. Its gotten to the point where being honest with your job is a sure-fire way to *never* get it. \n\nAnd so the legend lives on. The heart will always race, the palms will always sweat, and the anxiety will always increase when Martha Webber is on deck. ",

The roads were plowed but still pretty slippery. \n\nWe'll call the poor sap who took this delivery Dave.\n\nApparently Dave arrived at their driveway to find that it was entirely covered in 2ft of snow. And a plow drift even higher. I mistook this driveway as an ATV trail the first time I went, as it's about 1/4 mile long, deeply rutted, and entirely made of mud. Snapping an ankle would be a well-founded concern in these conditions. Not to mention it was about 20°F outside.\n\nDave called the customer to complain about the lack of a pathway, but relented and took the journey. Which was about a half hour, each way. When he got to the door the customers were *pissed* that their pizza was cold and refused to even tip. So he took the long drive back with only frozen pants and the $3 delivery charge to show for it.\n\nAfter being gone for about 2 hours (30 minute drive and 30 minute walk each way) and relating me this story all I could say was \"*And you actually did it??* I wouldn't have walked through that. You should have told them to come pick it up!\" Poor dumb, sweet Dave.\n",

        "text": "This happened this past Sunday during my opening shift.\n\n\nWe get a call from a customer asking if the driver would be willing to pick up a pack of cigarettes for her on the way, assuring she would tip generously. I was the only driver as it was about noon. I still hadn't had a delivery yet and we were pretty slow so I said sure, as long as they were above 18. The customer was in her late 50s so I didn't have a problem.\n\n\nCustomer calls back a few minutes later, I answer, she tells me the type of cigarettes and I get back to work. Right before I leave, she calls again and adds to the order. Great. I wait another 6-7 minutes for the extra food to be done, read the receipt and see she needs a Pepsi. No problem, I grab one as I leave with the order. As I'm minutes away I realize the receipt says Diet and normal pepsi, two 2-liters, not one. Great. Get to the house, hand over the pizza and soda, explain that I forgot a 2-liter and will be right back. I hand over the pack of cigs I picked up on the way only for her to say she wanted 2 packs (She didn't). No problem I guess, I'm gonna come back here anyways with the extra soda.\n\n\n\n\nFast forward a bit, I come back with the soda and extra pack of cigs.\n\nMe: \"Okay, I need $12 for both of the packs of cigarettes.\"\n\nCust: \"Oh, it was supposed to be on the card.\"\n\nMe: \"No, we can't add cigarettes to your bill.\" (Obviously, right?)\n\nShe doesn't have cash and I tell her she can add it as a tip on the other card receipt. (She had 2 separate payments because of the late addition.) She agrees and adds $12 to the other receipt (The first she tipped $5 on.) End of interaction, I leave and work the rest of my shift, all is good. Except it wasn't.\n\nI came in to work this afternoon to find that she called corporate claiming that I forged not just the $12, but the $5 actual tip. The $5 is accounted for because on that slip she wrote the net total, but the other slip she wrote the total as it was without the $12 added because she signed it the first time I got there and I hadn't asked for the money for the cigs yet. She didn't update the total either.\n\nSo far, nothing more than light questioning by my manager has happened to me personally but she said the issue has escalated pretty high up the ladder.\n\n---\n**TL;DR:** I picked up cigs for a customer, not once, but twice in one delivery. She pays via tip on credit card. She then turns around and said that I forged the total on both slips and tries to get me fired.",

She said, \"Oh damn, you're soaked!\" And laughed, right in my face. Then no tip and shut the door in my face.

My mom would order over the phone, and pay with card over the phone. She'd always give me cash, and tell me to go get the pizza. One particular time, I answered the door with no shirt, and XL super mario pajamas (I was a small). The guy complimented me on the pajamas, and handed me the pizza and the check. He was pretty friendly and he mentioned it was his birthday (don't remember how, but it didn't seem like he was trying to go for a bigger tip, though he probably was). After I got the pizzas I gave him a 10 and asked for change. He said he had change out in his car, but where I live you have to walk downstairs to get your car, then back up. So I just said keep the 10, happy birthday. But then I did what I always do, and put the amount I tipped on the check too, another 10, and gave it back to him. He was pretty stoked to say the least, but I thought he just really wanted 10 bucks. \n\nI double tipped for years. When I found out I felt like a fool. At least that guy got a sweet tip on a single pizza.",

        "text": "All three JJs I worked at had some roadside danger or quirk to it: the old franchise headquarters had the notoriously shitty tippers in the southern neighborhoods; the (then) brand new store had the largest population of Californians/Texans who moved in, and thus posed major threats in 4-way intersections; and now, the one I work at, with it's massive speeder problem.\n\nBy \"massive\", I'm talking seeing someone pulled over on the road facing the store thrice or quarce a week. Before one could pop a justice boner, a closer examination of the suspect would reveal that they're an older fellow, and not some young boy racer. It was always a BMW, new Honda CR-V or Toyota Rav4, or some other maroon-or-black retiree car. Sure, you'd *hear* some teen driving hard, like this one RSX-R that blows on by weekly, but as stated, the biggest culprits are tired midlifers blasting their way home in their family cars. They're quiet, but you better check your mirrors well, as they'll tear the doors off your ride.\n\nThis brings me to \"the Soccermom\".\n\nWe have this lengthy stretch of construction around our store. Cones, trucks, redirected roads, all the works are present. Well, I'm somewhat of an autocross fan, so when I see cones, I like to get as close to the cones as possible. Makes things a little fun on a slow day, you know. Well, as I was making the usual cone hijinks, I see this Odyssey pull up from behind. This person was obviously inhibited by my speed, judging by how she appeared as a dot in my rearview mirror one second, and then a clear bust portrait in the next. I felt compelled to push the speed limit a little bit, just to see what she would do. I drive a sport(ier) car with brand new struts on it, so I figured it wouldn't be much trouble for me.\n\nSure enough, 35 became 40, and then 45, and she stuck right behind me, unwavering. She even pushed on through the redirected route that I, in a mood of spirited driving, heel-toe through! Whoever she was, she wasn't playing around.\n\nEventually, the construction-inhibited serpentine path straightened out and widened back into the standard street once the traffic lights came into clear vision. The turn arrow was green, but I knew it wouldn't be for long. I heel-toe down from 3rd to 2nd, anticipate and account for the dip in the road's geography around the drain gate, and swing the car around the corner for one final diversion before turning into the business center containing the store. But hot damn, I looked in my rearview mirror one last time to see if that van was still there. Not turning up results, I felt a bit smug, as I finally lost that cargo barge with my fun little car. Well, that was until I saw it blow by me as I turned my head back around.\n\nThat van, kicking up loose gravel on the freshly paved road, tore off into the distance, leaving me far behind. Stirred, the last thing I remember about that van was the sticker on the back: \"2016 [acronym] Champs\" in the shape of a soccer ball.\n\nDamn son, I wonder what her hurry was.\n\nTl;Dr got smoked by a soccermom in the corners and sort of in the straights",

For some background, I deliver in a risky area, so much so that we don't use car top signs and we are the highest paid store in the franchise. I'm a really small, young woman and I get comments almost everyday about being so young/small and being afraid to do my job. Yesterday was sort of a blur for me anyway, as I had a lot on my mind. I got to the house totally distracted, my fault- knowing the delivery area I should've been on high alert on this particular street- but went to the door at usual. A man walked up to me to pay, but was also holding a pistol aimed in my direction. I was just in shock and did my normal routine, albeit awkwardly and staring at the gun the entire time. I mean, who am I to argue with a stranger with a gun? He wasn't hostile or threatening, just holding it like it wasn't a big deal. I got the money and left and was just in shock for the last 30 or so minutes I was there, and didn't mention it to my manager. Is it too late to mention it now? I've kind of gotten my wits about me and have been kicking myself all day for not speaking up. I don't want another driver to be put in the same situation and possibly have a different outcome. \n\nEdit: (Update) I told my assistant manager what happened. GM was called, and he came to the store immediately. A report was filed, customer called, and she said dude doesn't live there blah blah blah. That house was added to our (mile long) \"do not deliver\" list and the police were notified. Since he doesn't live at that address, and I could only give a description but no name, there's not really much they can do but keep an extra watch over there. Other drivers were told to be extra vigilant just in case, and to be aware of their surroundings at all times. Standard procedure but a fresh reminder. Stay safe out there, y'all. This driver is retiring soon, I've had too many things go wrong to keep justifying staying. ",

GM's gf was yelled at for not wearing proper pants or non-slip shoes, manager got roasted for not wearing his hat while working make-table, but nothing is being done because \"The GM and [Cook's Name] denied everything that you guys are telling us\" so yeah\n\nSo yesterday was my last day working as a driver in California. I'm moving to Texas for grad school so I had to quit (although I wouldn't have been against just qutting on my own with all of the drama happening).\n\nI come in and it's a satuday opening shift. Manager is finally not mad at me because I stopped wearing manager shirts (aka. I ran out of clean ones so I wore my regular shirt). After an awkward conversation about Texas and such, once his girlfriend came in, I pretty much had nothing much to do.\n\nI was so excited, though. You can imagine it like being a high school senior, saying like \"This is my last first day of school ever!!!!\"\n\nThis would be my last first delivery in California! It would hopefully be really easy, really chill!\n\nI get the delivery, and put in the address. It's to the local Jiffy Lube, a place I went to just a few days ago to get my oil done, because I am a corporate shill and pay more than I have to to support the capitalist regime (and my mom paid for it so).\n\nA single pizza, and an 8 piece of wings! It wasn't... horrible, but single pizza deliveries to businesses usually suck ass. What these usually end up becoming is me driving there and having to spend 5 minutes finding the dude because he's still at work, dealing with at least 1 customer saying \"hey it's for ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)))))))))!!!!!!!!! Lemme get a SLICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\", and then you usually don't get tipped because life is a fuck.\n\nHowever, it's better than pretending to clean the 0 dishes we had and pretending to be friendly to the other two workers. Plus it's mileage so whatever.\n\nSo I go to cut, put the garlic crust on (because it's hand-tossed and all hand-tossed pizzas come with a garlic butter crust, which it says on the website), double check and confirm everything (because I'm not ready to have a Ranch Roast Session on my last day).\n\nI get to the Jiffy Lube, and firstly the entrance is only on one side of the road. So I park by the In-N-Out next door and walk over. \n\n\"HEY LEMME GET A SLICE\"\n\nAt least I got it over with early\n\nMe: [Hearty fake chortle with hopes that he will stop]\n\nSo I get there and after finding the guy, turns out he's the shift manager.\n\nTurns out he's busy and will be with me in like 5 minutes\n\nTurns out he got the entire pizza for himself. No sharing.\n\nSo I'm sitting inside, and it's \"LEMME GET A SLICE\" man, making a few more cracks about his desperate need for a slice of pizza this instant, and another employee who's busy doing paperwork.\n\nWe talk for a bit and we both come to the conclusion that nobody else in the jiffy lube is getting this pizza except for him. Which gets the worker a little bit understandably annoyed that the manager didn't even ask or anything. \n\nAfter he literally said \"Fuck man this guy is a dick, I'm thinking about putting my 2 weeks in\", the manager comes in, pays for his food, and I leave instantly.\n\n$2 tip, pretty okay considering I didn't have to coerce him for it.\n\nChugga chugga choo choo, I go back to the store\n\nI get back to the store and my GM just laughs and says \"dude that guy was so pissed\"\n\nI begin to freak out a little bit. Was this my fault? Did I forget his sauce (that he didn't order)? Did I put a wrong topping? Did the pizza flip? Did I take a fat shit on the pizza without realizing?\n\nHowever, here was the problem.\n\nThere was garlic butter on the crust.\n\nThis simple fact lead this man to run to his (probably work) phone, call up our store, and literally scream at our manager. I'm not sure exactly what he said, but it was enough for my GM to say \"god that guy was an asshole lmao\"\n\nSomehow he also managed to finesse his way into getting his entire card refunded, rather than just having a credit taken or another pizza delivered (which would have sucked but idc it's my last day)\n\nBecause his entire card was voided and refunded, this also voided the $2 tip that he wrote on the card.\n\nBasically, this man finessed himself a free pizza and wings, paid nothing for it, he gets to eat it while not sharing any with his coworkers, all by complaining that there was garlic butter on the pizza that he ordered with garlic butter.\n\nLife is hell and hell only serves pizza.\n\nThe next delivery I took, I got a $20 cash tip though, which was nice.",

Two future orders with 7 pizzas each show up, ovens get backed up. More and more orders are piling up and we're trying our best to get shit done. Meanwhile T who came in late hasn't done much more than help a few customers and sit in the office on his phone. \n\nTwo hours go by and we're just starting to get slow and only by a fucking miracle does T come to the back and get out two pans and preps up some thins for me. Hands me one and says it's Hawaiian luao, takes the other and of course it's just fucking cheese. Finishes that and goes and sits down. So now for three hours he's done a whole cheese pizza and that's it. \n\nI'm at my fucking boiling point now but shit is chilling out and I can just stand at the front for a bit to help get all these carry outs to their owners. While I'm up there I let the CSR know she can do the tips and just split them between her and the cook. I don't need to worry about a few bucks and I make more then now anyways. \n\nT comes over while I'm helping another customer and tells the CSR not to touch the tips (he usually stiffs her, so I'm sure that's why it was such a big deal to him). He starts bitching at her how he's the closing manager and blah blah blah. CSR girl let's him know that he is in fact not closing manager and that I am. I swear I could see steam coming from his ears as he tells her to stop \"playing her bitchy childish games\". \n\nJust to make sure he asks me if I'm closing and I say \"yep!\" with a big smile. \n\n\"Well no one told me. When do you want me to go?!\"\n\nMe: You can go now, whatever. \n\nSo he stomps off home where he bitches more to my coworkers and then gets into a fight with the CSR that stopped by his house to hang out. All because he didn't get to be closing manager. But man he's such hot shit when he sat on his ass for four whole fucking hours while me and a new cook did everything on a Saturday night. \n\nFuck you T. \n\nTL;DR dumb shift lead sits on his ass for 4 hours, gets pissed when he learns that me, the new shift lead is closing and storms off to his house where he bitches about me and gets into a fight with his ex-girlfriend (our CSR) that was the one to let him know he didn't get to close the store.",

This happened when I worked at a pizza place in a fairly small town.\n\nI had just completed a delivery for a regular customer and was about to get back in my car. Suddenly, a car ripped up on the neighbor's lawn across the street. I thought they had somehow skidded out and crashed, as they were literally in the lawn and pulled in with much force. I was still staring with mild bewilderment when this lady jumped out. \n\nLady, yelling from across the street: Excuse me! Do you know how to get to (car drives by, drowning her out) street? (She stares at me expectantly.)\n\nMe: What?\n\nLyfats: Do you know wh (another perfectly timed car drives by) eet is? (Still looking at me like I should have heard her).\n\nMe: Huh? I can't hear you.\n\nLyfats: I'm trying to get to Pl (yet another hilariously well timed car drives by. She apparently doesn't understand how noise works).\n\nMind you, this a main road, but a small town. The fact that she kept getting drown out was a huge coincidence. But I wasn't about to shout directions across the street.\n\nMe: I can't hear you and I have to get back to work.\n\nI go to get back in my car and leave. This lady then jumps in her car and rips up into my customers driveway. Once again, this isn't a terribly busy road. She could have easily walked across at any point. Now I have to get back out and talk to this clearly deranged woman.\n\nMe trying to remain polite: Where are you trying to get to?\n\nLady of questionable sanity: I'm looking for Pleasentdale St or Pleasentville St or something like that. There's a Buddhist center up there.\n\nMe: Oh, OK. I know exactly where that is. (I proceed to give her perfect directions. It's not too far and there's only a couple turns involved. The lady continues to stare at me in her blank, expectant expression.) Ummm.... yeah that's it. \n\nThe customer has now come back out of her house, clearly confused by my conversation in her driveway. The lady of questionable sanity turns to her, and I take this opportunity to make my escape.\n\nMe: Got to get back to work. Time is money. (Fake laugh, as I jump back in my car and leave this poor customer to deal with the situation.)\n\n",

        "text": "First time poster here, and as a side note, I have been out of the service industry for over 10 years. I had a conversation with a co worker recently, and we were discussing what we did before we got into our current line of work. Turns out he and I started out at local pizza places as teens, cleaning dishes, tables, etc. He mentions to me that he currently works as a driver part time, just for some extra cash, and he was sharing a story of a customer who was totally clueless about how online ordering works. Elderly man most likely in his 80s, so it's understandable.\n\nWhich got me to thinking about one of my favorite memories from back in the day.\n\nAfter a few months at my local joint, I was trained on how to take orders over the phone (early to mid 2000s, so online ordering hadn't quite taken off yet.) This guy calls in, an elderly gentleman (important for how this ends) asks about our specials, how far we deliver, you know the drill. He places his order for a large cheese pizza and a calzone, with a drink. Pretty simple. I then tell him that for just $1 extra, he can have up to 5 toppings (current deal with purchase of a side item in addition to pizza.)\n\n\"Sure, what the hell! Pepperoni, beef, Canadian bacon, black olives, and pineapple.\" Take down his payment info, his address, and I tell him how long it will be, and to have a great night.\n\nFast forward to an hour later, the same guy calls, and he sounds like he is choking, and he somehow yells, \"G*dammit, that pizza almost killed me, what the hell was on it?! Is this a sick joke?! So help me God, I'm gonna sue you and ruin you!!!\"\n\nI immediately pull up his order and ask him what was wrong with it, he replies, \"I don't know, but something in there is poison! I can't breathe, and I know it's the damn pizza!\". Even though I was 15, I realized rather quickly what most likely caused it.\n\nMe: \"Not to be intrusive, but are you allergic to pineapple by any chance?\" (I swear I can hear the gears turning in his head over the phone)\n\nHim: \"Sonofab***h, g*dammit, that's what it is!!!\n\nMe: \"Sir, how did you not know you were allergic to pineapple?\"\n\nHim: \"Huh. Well, how was I supposed to know? My wife passed on a few years ago, and she kept track of this kind of thing.\"\n\nI instantly felt my tone change from being annoyed to feeling sad for him, since I realized he was just a lonely old guy, and I honestly believe he forgot.\n\nMe: \"Do you need us to call 911 for you? We have your address, so we can take care of that.\"\n\nHim: *still choking and sputtering but sounding a little better \"No, I'll be fine, the Nazi sons of b***hes couldn't kill me, this ain't gonna do me in neither!\"\n\nI completely lose it at this point, putting the phone down so he doesn't hear me laughing, and my manager steps in and takes over. He comps him, even though it was his mistake, and makes sure one more time that he doesn't need help.\n\nOne week later, an older guy walks in, and I happen to be cleaning up the salad bar area, I greet him, and his face lights up, \"Hey, you're the one that helped the dumb*** that didn't know his allergies! It's me!\" From that day forward, he would come in to the store every other day or so, and during our slow times, he would regale us with old war stories. And whatever he ordered, we always reminded him NO PINEAPPLE!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The driver comes back and again no answer. So I cancel the order.\n\nThe customer calls a second time and I basically tell them that I'm not going to deliver the pizza. Of course he gets pissed. He's cursing and cussing up a storm and belittling me. Let's call the customer AH for a-hole and ME for me.\n\n&gt;ME: Sorry sir.

You are on speaker phone and 6 people heard you cuss at me.\n\n&gt;ME: &lt;confused&gt; I did? what did I say?\n\n&gt;AH: You said 'crap'.\n\n&gt;ME: &lt;long pause&gt;... Really? After all the things you said to me you're going try and get me in trouble for saying, \"you've treated me like crap.\" You're not getting any thing from this store anymore.\n\nI hang up and head to the computer. I access the guy's record and edit his name and address to 'DO NOT DELIVER' and add the note 'no tip' so the driver won't want to deliver anyway.\n\nAnd yes, pizza delivery drivers do keep track of good and bad tippers.

        "text": "Technically we're supposed to show off the pizza to the customer before we start the transaction to make sure everything is fine. However sometimes we don't either due to a long line of customers, or it's a driver and they don't know to do that because it's never mentioned during training (training being a random person being like \"press this button don't fuck up lmao\")\n\nSometimes we make genuine mistakes. We'll put on pepperoni instead of salami, we'll accidentally forget a crust topping, we'll give someone the wrong pizza because the receipt fell off. And if a customer leaves the store and realizes this, we'll probably give them a credit as a means to [s]not have to deal with this shit[/s] apologize for the mistake.\n\nSometimes, however, people are weird. They'll get mad because there's a \"wrong topping\", even though they ordered it. They'll scream because there's \"not enough sauce\" when there's enough sauce as determined by our portioning system. They'll make a bitchfit about how the \"extra sauce\" isn't extra enough after eating the entire pizza. If they complain in the store after seeing the pizza, we'll usually just re-make it for free. If they complain when they get home, we'll offer credit but also if they drive back and bring back the old pizza we'll give them the correct pizza. Standard stuff\n\nSometimes stuff befuddles me though. Primarily an incident I remembered while typing another post.\n\nRather than a long story, I'll just keep it brief\n\nHOW THE FUCK DO YOU ORDER 2 DINNER BOXES AND NOT REALIZE THAT YOU ONLY GOT ONE AFTER 45 MINUTES AND THEN DEMAND THAT WE MAKE ANOTHER ONE FRESH FOR YOU.\n\nLike yeah, cashier should have checked, but ultimately at the end of the day, you're responsible for making sure you have everything. That's why I check the pizzas on my own before taking it home, that's why I sit at the end of the drive through and make sure they didn't put stuff on my burger I didn't want, that's why I make sure everything is correct when I do ANYTHING online or in person.\n\nBUT HOW\n\nAND HOW DO YOU NOT NOTICE FOR 45 MINUTES\n\nI give someone a good about 10-15 minutes from receiving the order to see if they're going to complain about something. Because that's about the time it takes to get the order, settle down, get ready to eat, and then be like \"oops wait\" (assuming they just don't start immediately).\n\nEspecially if it's carryout and you're just litreally in your car and can open the box\n\nOr not even open the box, just literally be like \"damn these two boxes are super light and also feel suspiciously like one box\"\n\nThis job is making me go insane please kill me quickly",

I legitimately did EVERYTHING that I physically could, and watched an episode of Always Sunny before anything happened. \n\nSo we're sharing stories and she tell me of a story that happened last night.\n\nSo someone takes a delivery and forgets the marinara cup. This is pretty annoying but also insanely common, since drivers don't really check for it. I try to combat this when I'm at cut by putting the marinara in the box, but I can't win them all. Usually when this happens, I do one of one things.\n\n1) Apologize, give them a credit (unless they're just being hoes and it doesn't come with marinara and they didn't order any extra), and just let it be because honestly like it's marinara who the fuck\n\nAnd this is the plan that my GM uses. I've actually driven back to a house for a marinara cup, but I did it behind my boss's back and only because the place I was delivering to was on the same road as this house. But usually it's fucking stupid to drive all the way back for a marinara cup, especially during dinner rush.\n\nApparently though this man was NOT okay with this. After screaming on the phone for about 5 minutes about how he deserves his marinara and how this place is shit and how our GM should be fired (which like he's not wrong but) and how the universe relies on this man's cheaply produced cup of marinara, he apparently drives his bitch ass over to Pizza Hut and demands to speak with our manager.\n\nThe GM left for the day to go fuck his girlfriend (having her cash out an hour early after she hung out in the corner on her phone, when our GM wasn't even the manager on duty today), so of course it's just our shift manager.\n\nM: Manager\nT: Mike \"The Rock\" Tyson\n\n&gt;M: Hi I'm the manager what's up\n\n&gt;T: NO YOU'RE NOT\n\n&gt;M: a\n\n&gt;T: THE MAN I SPOKE TO WAS A MAN\n\n&gt;M: Well I assume you mean our GM, he left for the night and I'm the manager on duty now\n\n&gt;T: GET HIM BACK\n\n&gt;M: Sir he left\n\n&gt;T: GO IN THE BACK AND GET HIM\n\nThis manager, being someone who is not in the mood to deal with this shit, walked over to the back, and after dicking around on her phone for like 2 minutes, mentally preparing for a WWE Smackdown, walked back to the store\n\n&gt;M: He's not there, he left\n\n&gt;T: WELL I WANT MY MARINARA, YOUR MANAGER IS A PIECE OF SHIT\n\n&gt;M: a\n\n&gt;T: I'M GONNA BEAT HIS ASS. WHEN'S HE COMING BACK\n\n&gt;M: [gives his shift]\n\n&gt;T: FUCK YOU GUYS, I'LL GO MIKE TYSON ON HIS ASS. *Dramatic exit into the sunset. The Matador of Marinara would continue his quest for Marinara at a later time*\n\nI'm not sure exactly how I feel about this because like I thought the people that drove and screamed at me for \"stealing their money\" was bad but like\n\nthis is a cup of marinara\n\nEven if he paid for it like fuck lmao it's 50 cents\n\nIt's not even that good\n\nDip it in the pizza lmao\n\nfuck go to the store and buy some marinara\n\nthis shit is literally bagged gloop with 6 flasks of water\n\nand honestly at the end of that all I'm not even sure if he got his marinara cup that we could have just literally given him.\n\nMoral of the story: If you happen to be fucking insane, please order carryout so you can at least check before you leave.\n\nAlso legally I have to say please don't beat my GM's ass but also as a person I wouldn't particularly be too mad about it",

They got a future time order at 10:47 for noon. 60 pizzas and not just 30 cheese and 30 pepperoni but all sorts of deluxe pizzas. Naturally everyone freaked out because these assholes gave them less than 1hour and 15 minute notice. Hell I didn't even know there was enough dough in the cooler for this. They managed to pull it off and off goes the driver with all of the pizzas to some business in a business park. I never thought to ask him how long it took to unload a $1,000 worth of food so I'll update later. He hands whoever was in charge the receipt to sign off on it and hand it back to him. Then they say \"oh wait a minute\". He hands them back the receipt they scribble on it and hand it back to him. He looks at it and on the tip line it has $130 crossed out and $10 right next to it. They tell him I was tipping like this was a restaurant but I forgot, it's just pizza.\n",

Meaning if it will only take us 7 minutes to get there we will deliver it. On my second day I grab 2 boxes check the addresses and head out. Deliver the first one no problem, go to put the new address in for the second pizza and it lists 30min away... Well that can't be right someone must have entered the address in wrong. I call the customer and confirm that is the address and it indeed is in XXX town 30 minutes away.\n\nI call the store to ask them what I am supposed to do. They inform me that I have to deliver it and to let them know they are outside of our service area for next time. Ok I guess. Its pretty slow at the pizza place anyways. Ill probably get a 2-3 buck tip to make up for the gas. No big deal.\n\nI arrive to the location. It is one of those warehouses converted into condos. Call the customer she says she is in apartment/condo thing XXX. I ask which building and she describes where it is. I enter in and then can't figure shit out in this maze of a building. Finally I arrive, give her the pizza and side marinara that she ordered. She then asks where the other one is and I said it looks like there is just the one. She then jokes by saying I guess I know now not to order from that store anymore. Have a great night. Check the receipt... tipped 70 cents... I was pretty pissed on that ride back.",

Well it certainly has to be the first number I gave you.\n\nNo sir, none of the numbers came up and I'm certain this is because you are not in our delivery area. We do not deliver to you.\n\nI know you've delivered to us. You're on (really long main street that travels through several different cities, why I never just say yes to being on said street but always reinforce with side streets) and we order from you all the time.\n\nYes sir we are on that street, but there is more than one PH on that street. Your information did not come up in our system, we have not delivered to you and you are out of our delivery area.\n\nAre you sure you haven't reset your information recently and erased our number from your system? I know we've ordered from you guys, not that long ago!\n\nNo sir, we have not reset any of our information. Nothing has been reset. You are not in our delivery area.\n\nNo no, you are wrong. You guys have delivered to us several times. In fact I know I've talked to you before and you have taken our order. \n\nHold on please. (Look at map, get number of the area that delivers to him, go back to phone, wait for him to pay attention again.) You are out of our area. I can give you the number to the PH that delivers to you.

That nice Hispanic guy has delivered a few times, that older white guy. We've even had a girl driver deliver to us a few times. I know you've delivered to us, you've been the one to deliver to us every time we've ordered!\n\nNo sir, you are not in our area. We have never delivered to you. I can give you the number to the PH in your area if you'd like to just write it down.\n\nNo no, we order every week! Sometimes more than once a week! We get pizza with cheese in the crust, and wings, and we order salad without onions, every week from you guys.\n\nSir, we do not serve salads and never have.\n\nOh.

        "text": "So if you guys haven't already gotten it from my other stories, I've grown to hate my GM.\n\nHe started off as a okay guy, and most of what made him okay are still okay. Very flexible with scheduling, works his ass off and will help out when needed, works well with school and won't schedule you on a day unless your availability says you can work that day.\n\nBut then things started going downhill.\n\nI've already talked about how he started dating a then 17 year old worker, who's relationship has escalated from just him hovering around her, to him being very subtle about things (knowing where she lives, for instance), to her being able to skip out on company policy, to her being scheduled only on the days nad times he works, to her spending HOURS out back with him, to her coming back on the 4th of july with hickeys on her neck, to SO much stuff.\n\nThen I learned he's an asshole to other workers. I never noticed it because I've been on his good side, but I heard lots of stories. Then I began hearing it.\n\nDriver: \"I can take that as a triple!\"\n\nGM: \"haha, you're funny, I should write you up for that.\"\n\nHe fired someone for getting a little stressed at him and saying \"bullshit\", he tries to \"transfer\" anyone that doesn't like him, and he likes cutting hours to people who give him shit.\n\nHe hasn't hired any new managers until this week, even though one quit in may and the other in the beginning of the month, and has been leaving the other 2 managers stressed to the point where one broke down crying during a shift because of how overworked she was, and how he constantly would yell at them for things out of their control.\n\nAbove all that, I worked my ass off for this pizza hut, because I love the people that work there. Besides the girl that my GM is screwing, as well as another girl that's a little annoying (but who apparently got let go), I love coming into work and seeing them. Especially when my GM isn't there, I have so much fun working. I work my ass off, drive hard, cook hard, prep hard, and make my damndest sure that every customer has a great fucking experience.\n\nThis is how my GM killed my passion.\n\nSo I have a joke that every shift I cover, it gets fucking crazy. I'm covering a tuesday afternoon shift and... it gets fucking crazy. There's only me and the morning driver, who's a pretty okay driver, but she can't handle this all by herself! Especially because things aren't exactly portioned out super pretty in our area, so not everything can be made into a pretty double. \n\nI come in and work my magic. I try to figure out the best doubles to take, and slowly but surely, we manage to slow down orders (also my shift manager put the wait time at 2 hours which was nice. Nothing took more than 1 hour though).\n\nEventually the deliveries stop. The numbers look kind of low, but I prioritize everyone getting their food on time over numbers on a computer, so whatever. Plus I'm helping sales by clearing out the screen so our manager doesn't have to keep the delivery times up at 2 hours. \n\nSo I'm just hanging out, doing my tasks and whatnot, when the deliveries start coming up again. Sometimes during this, my GM comes in. He's not managing or anything, I think he's literally just training someone who may or may not be manager (cool dude btw).\n\nI joke around a lot when I'm at work now, now that I feel more comfortable around everyone. I usually end up sliding around and having a good time while joking around. \n\nSo I see a double that looks... pretty okay. But it's not okay according to the computer. I know the two areas and know that it wouldn't be the worst thing to take, and I can clear things up since the delivery time made it back up.\n\nSo I ask the shift manager \"Yo, can I take these two? They're at (xxx) and (yyy)\"\n\nAnd she's like \"uhhhh lemme think.\"\n\nSo I say \"haha, man if I were [shift manager] I'd be like \"oh yeah CDFReditum do it\" hahh-\"\n\nThen my GM comes out of nowhere. \n\nGM: \"Yeah and if I were [shift manager] I'd say that you doing that would ruin our times and numbers, and that you should stop being selfish and care about the manager for once\"\n\nI'm a little bit dumbfounded by this. I really don't respond to him other than a \"okay\" because I'm honestly a little bit shocked.\n\nI am the same person that has worked his ass off for the company the entire time I've been here, even though I had huge school commitments to take care. I'm the same person that literally went into the work the day after I landed back from a month long vacation from Europe, and worked for 6 days in a row. I'm the same person that has covered multiple shifts every day this week, both opening and closing shifts. I'm the person that had worked so hard that everyone sees me as an honorary manager (and I would be manager had I not been moving to Texas soon), I'm the person that has worked 7 days in a row, had 1 day off, and am now working 5 days in a row. I was scheduled for 40 hours this pay period (2 weeks) and worked about 70. I've given my whole self to this company to make things happen, I've ran around doing other people's jobs, both driving, doing cut, cooking, answering phones, trying my best to just make things work. I tried my best to save ship when the new manager fucked everyone's orders, and I constantly make sure that this place is working like a well-oiled god damn machine. Yet it's ME who's selfish because I don't want people to get their food late.\n\nThe next 2 deliveries I took were late. One of which was a future order.\n\nHis girlfriend also came in, not wearing her hat and lounging around when both of her orders were ready to go. Meanwhile I'm trying to figure out how I can take more deliveries while narrowly missing the 6 hour mark so I don't screw over my manager for not giving me a lunch.\n\nI'm not passionate about Pizza Hut. I'm going to graduate school to be a Music Therapist, I don't care about my future with the company. What I do care about is that when I walk though those doors to work my shifts, that good hardworking people get what they ask for, and that I'm doing everything I can to make that happen.\n\nI hate this job so much because my GM has shown that he doesn't give a shit about the customer. He doesn't give a shit about anyone but those who suck up to him. And he doesn't see hard work and selflessness when it's staring him in the face. I don't work as hard as I do because I have a fetish for working, I work hard because I feel that I have an obligation to give it my all when I do anything. It's not fun when I have to tell my girlfriend \"hey, I got called in for work, we can't spend all day together like I planned\", but I do it for the company. I do it for my coworkers, I do it for the customers...\n\nBut god damn am I so glad it's my last week. 4 more shifts of this bullshit then I'm done. I can go work at wherever I end up in texas, then I can work as a music therapist, live a happy life with my wife, and forget about this shit, because no person should be working this hard just to get told off like that, and accused of being selfish when they've spent so long being selfless for the company.

He was fine - I did my best - don't think we ever got the request again, but I didn't usually work days.\n\nhad a \"just sauce on the crust\" order as well - no toppings or cheese - again, had to say \"not sure how the sauce comes out after that - do you want it on AFTER?\" he didn't ",

I swear the ring sounds different when you get a feeling the person on the other end is going to be a jackass. \n\nThis happened a few weeks ago. The phone rings, I answer it and ask for the guy's information. He gives me his address which doesn't sound familiar at all. I have a feeling it might not be in our delivery area so I ask him if he can hold and then quickly pull out my phone and check his address on the gps. \n\nYep, it's not in our delivery area. It's just slightly off by one street. \n\nI get back on the phone, \"it looks like that's not in our delivery area but that the Pizza Hut down on # Street can delivers to you and can take your order. Would you like their phone number?\" No answer. I hear shuffling sounds so I assume he put his phone down or something. \n\n\"Hello?\" \"Still there?\" \"hello?\" \"Still there?\" \"hello?\" \"Still there?\" He never responds. I didn't have anything else to do so I thought I'd give him a chance to get back on his phone instead of just hanging up. \n\nA few seconds later he angrily says, *\"hello!?\"* As if I hadn't been trying to get his attention the last 20 seconds. \n\n\"Hi, sorry about that. It looks like you're actually in the other pizza hut's delivery area. Would you like their phone number?\"\n\n*\"What do you mean?\"*\n\n\"That's not in our delivery area but the other store delivers to you, I can give you their number.\"\n\n*\"Why's that matter? It's still just pizza. Can't you just deliver it!?\"*\n\n\"No. It's not in our delivery area. The other pizza hu-\"\n\n*\"Jesus fucking Christ! Fucking stupid!\" He interrupts me and then hangs up.*\n\n\nGreat start to a long shift. ",

        "text": "some of the comments recently made me think of this\n\nback in my day (the 80s) a portion of the customers thought that we were personally responsible for the orders.  As in - if they rejected it (for being late, or having a bubble, or whatever) - the cost came out of MY pocket.\n\nthis came up regularly - unhappy customers (almost never because of me - but a couple times) almost gleeful that I'd have to eat the cost - when, instead I got to eat the pizza along with my co-workers (always gotta hope it isn't a weird one). At least that was how it worked back then.  \n\njust wondering - I certainly hope you aren't - since it's never a driver's fault (I mean I guess: tripped on the stairs and fell on the box - rolled the company car - that kind of thing) \n\nmanagers would also sometimes make \"crew pies\" - just an extra pizza to share for the heck of it",
