When/if that new immigrant gets their green card, they can then sponsor someone else. \n\nIn any single step, **only** parents, children, spouses and siblings of the green card holder can be sponsored, right?\n\nSo then the \"chain\" term comes in when I sponsor my brother, who then sponsors his wife, who sponsors her mom, who sponsors her 5 kids, who then sponsor their 3 siblings each...so my one sponsorship could potentially lead to the sponsorship of people with no relation to me.\n\nDoes all that conform to the current law as I've described it? And after that, what does the current administration want to change it to?\n\nThank you.",

        "text": "Our users may not realize, but the majority of submissions to NeutralPolitics require at least some changes to be approved, and many cannot be approved at all.  I want to go through a few of the common issues we see and give some advice.\n\n##**Avoid Negative Framing.**\n\nOne common issue is leading questions which use negative framing like:\n\n* Why don't we do [X policy]?\n\n* Why doesn't [X politician] do Y?\n\n* Why can't we have [X thing] in the USA?\n\n* Why shouldn't it be required that people [do X]?\n\nThese questions are leading.  By using a negative frame, they presuppose the positiveness or correctness of the thing they're asking about.\n\nA better way to ask a question is to ask it affirmatively, or ask for details, so:\n\n* What are the pros and cons of X policy?\n\n* What are the precedents for [an office-holder/candidate] doing X?\n\n* Is it feasible to have [X thing] in the USA?\n\n* What is the evidence for and against requiring people to do Z?\n\nThis allows a user to give a concrete answer without building in the assumption that the answer should support a particular premise.\n\n##**If you \"heard\" something, source it.**\n\nYou would not believe the number of times people post about things they're \"hearing\" about.  NeutralPolitics can't allow anything like that to be approved.  If something is being talked about a lot, it should be easy to find articles talking about it.  If you want, you can even modmail us and ask for help with your post.  Most of us are news or policy junkies and probably can help you find some good sources.\n\n##**\"The right\" and  \"the left\" did not say things.  Name a person who said the thing.**\n\nAnother big issue we get is things like \"people on the right/the left/republicans/democrats/the media\" have been saying X.  Often X is an inflammatory/strawman argument.\n\nLike things you \"heard about,\" this will not do.  NeutralPolitics doesn't do blind quotes.  Find an opinion article or something with a named person making that argument.  For example:\n\n*  **Bad** \"[X party] has been saying that [Y policy] has been really popular despite the polls.\n\n* **Good** [Person A], a [X party] member of Congress, said \"[Y policy] has been really popular despite the polls.\" [link to source]\n\n##**Avoid asking \"why\" people do things.**\n\nNeutralPolitics is full of policy nerds, not mind readers.  Asking why a politician did X or Y is almost always futile, and going to result in a bad thread. \n\nInstead of asking just \"why\" someone does or says something, consider these:\n\n* What are the stated reasons for [X person doing Y]?\n\n* What reasons other than those stated would [X person] have for [doing Y]?\n\n* Who stands to gain or be hurt by [X person doing Y]?\n\nThose all change the question to one which can be more readily answered with facts.",

It states that the only reason Robert Mueller and his investigation exist still is because Trump's White House Counsel refused to carry out Trump's order. Trump then backed off when the White House Counsel threatened to quit in response.\n\n-\n\nOn Fox News, and specifically [Fox and Friends this morning](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/01/26/trump-slams-report-claiming-sought-to-fire-mueller-blames-fake-news.html), some hosts have argued that this act does not matter because Trump didn't end up firing Mueller in the end, so the report is a non-starter. It would only have been obstruction had the order been followed to completion. \n\nOther pro-Trump arguments [(same Fox News article with quote at 1:45 in video)](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/01/26/trump-slams-report-claiming-sought-to-fire-mueller-blames-fake-news.html) include that Trump backed off of the firing after being given proper guidance by his Counsel -- albeit guidance in the form of a threat. But nonetheless, Trump let the investigation continue once he was given more information regarding the matter. \n\n-\n\n-\n\nMy question, in the title, is something that is being hotly debated on every single news channel and in every debate circle. Does obstruction of justice need the actual act carried out to completion? Is the case of obstruction of justice less weighty considering the fact that Trump didn't pursue the firing after White House Counsel threatened to resign? Does Trump now have a better case *against* obstruction of justice seeing as he changed his mind on firing Mueller and let it continue unobstructed?",

        "text": "[CELL PHONE PRIVACY Case description in **Carpenter v. U.S.**](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/16-402)\n\n[SCOTUS ON PHONE PRIVACY CASE](http://thehill.com/policy/technology/overnights/362450-overnight-tech-scotus-considers-phone-tracking-apples-new)\n\n\"Members of the Supreme Court appeared troubled Wednesday that police can search cellphone location histories without a warrant, but struggled with where the line should be drawn on privacy in the digital age… Carpenter says the FBI violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure by obtaining a history of his cellphone location data without a warrant from his wireless carriers, MetroPCS and Sprint. The government then used that information at trial to convict him…   The standard is higher to obtain a warrant, with law enforcement officers required to show there is probable cause to believe a crime has occurred.\"\n\n[The **Liberal-Conservative Alliance** on the Supreme Court Against Digital Surveillance](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/bipartisanship-supreme-court/547124/)\n\n\"On Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard what could become the most important electronic-privacy case of the 21st century. The justices considered whether the government, without a warrant, can effectively trace our movements in public for months on end by demanding 127 days of the geolocational data—known as cell-site location information—that mobile phones beam out 24 hours a day. During the argument, it was encouraging to see two justices with very different perspectives—Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch—make passionate arguments for why allowing these kinds of mass searches of our digital effects would be as invasive and unreasonable as the hated general warrants that helped spark the American Revolution. It’s possible, therefore, that Carpenter v. United States may continue a welcome recent trend: Liberal and conservative justices on the Court, by broad bipartisan margins, are insisting on translating the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution into the digital age.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan framed the stakes in the case by asking Michael Dreeben, the deputy solicitor general, how this case was different from United States v. Jones, a 2012 case where the government tracked a suspect for a month without a warrant by clamping a Global Positioning System device on the bottom of his car. Five justices, led by Justice Antonin Scalia, said that the police violated the suspect’s property rights by committing a physical trespass for the purpose of collecting information—they walked onto his driveway and physically seized his car… Dreeben responded that the Jones case involved government surveillance in public, while in this case, the government was seizing business records that individuals had voluntarily turned over to their third-party cellphone carriers, who stored them in the digital cloud. A 1979 case called Smith v. Maryland held that individuals have no expectation of privacy in the telephone numbers they voluntarily surrender to third parties, establishing what is now known as the third-party doctrine.\"\n\n[Would cell phone evidence be more likely to **prove your innocence** that to prove your guilt?]\n(https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnvillasenor/2017/10/22/is-warrantless-access-to-cell-site-info-a-fourth-amendment-violation-a-primer-on-carpenter-v-u-s/#1bca6c48603c)\n\n\"Given these ambiguities, with respect to evidence in criminal investigations CSLI is often far more useful as an exculpatory mechanism than as a mechanism to establish guilt. After all, CSLI can help show that a suspect was dozens or hundreds of miles away from a crime scene. But it can’t generally establish that a suspect was actually at a crime scene. Even in the case where the suspect was actually in the building of interest when a crime occurred, CSLI can at best help show that the suspect, as well as perhaps thousands of other people, was within a few miles, or a half a mile, or a few hundred yards (the precision depends on the size of the area served by the base station in question) of the crime scene… CSLI provides only a very approximate estimate of the actual location of the phone. For example, it might be possible to know that the phone is within a mile or two of a particular base station, but that wouldn’t be enough to place the phone in a particular building, on a particular street, or even in a particular neighborhood. On the other hand, if the mobile phone happens to be connected to a base station that serves a much smaller area, that would provide correspondingly more accurate location information.\"",

The group represents manufacturers as well as installers, sellers and others in the field.\n\n&gt;“While tariffs in this case will not create adequate cell or module manufacturing to meet U.S. demand, or keep foreign-owned Suniva and SolarWorld afloat, they will create a crisis in a part of our economy that has been thriving, which will ultimately cost tens of thousands of hard-working, blue-collar Americans their jobs,” Abigail Ross Hopper, the group's president, said in a statement. \n\n&gt;Suniva and SolarWorld Americas, the bankrupt companies which requested the tariffs, say tariffs would boost domestic manufacturing and add more than 100,000 jobs.\n\nSo is this a net gain or a net loss for American jobs, and what is the likely effect on the solar power industry in the U.S. and abroad?",

        "text": "With President Trump tweeting today that the the Senate should again use the nuclear option (I assume generally), I became curious about going the other way. \n\nAs background, the Senate requires 60 votes for ending debate and proceeding to a vote. This [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_option) explains things pretty well. In two situations, the rules have been changed to allow ending debate with a simple majority:\n\n* In November 2013, Senate Democrats changed rules to allow a simple majority for approval of judicial nominees (except for Supreme Court nominees).\n\n* In April 2017, Senate Republicans changed rules to allow simple majority for approval of all judicial nominees, including Supreme Court nominees\n\nCurrently, debate can end with 60 votes, with the exception of any judicial nominees, where a simple majority is required.\n\nSome Senators have stated they would like to undo the nuclear option: \n\n* [McCain and Flake (Nov 15, 2014)](https://www.azcentral.com/story/azdc/2014/11/15/mccain-flake-want-to-restore-filibuster-undo-nuclear-option/18894941/)\n\n* [Coons and Schumer (Feb 6, 2017)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/06/if-republicans-go-nuclear-will-it-be-senate-democrats-fault/)\n\nI'm interested in two parts of this issue, the first is politically, how it might come about. Since that calls for speculation, I don't believe it can be discussed here (though if it can, that would be great).\n\nThe second, though, is just procedural. The previous times the rules were changed, it was by following this process:\n\n1. Calling for cloture (end of debate)\n2. Being denied due to not having the 60 votes\n3. Objecting, saying that the rule has been misinterpreted\n4. Being denied because the rule is what it is\n5. Appealing the ruling\n6. Taking a vote (simple majority) on how the rule is interpreted\n7. Winning the vote and establishing a new interpretation\n\nProcedural, how might that situation come about to go the other way?",

A wall [they have openly said](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/08/democrats-rule-out-trumps-request-for-border-wall-funding-in-exchange-for-protecting-dreamers.html) they will not fund. \n\n&gt;A third option, [Blame everyone,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/01/18/if-the-government-shuts-down-heres-your-cheat-sheet-on-which-party-to-blame/?utm_term=.d8cbfc24faf5) in some form.\n\n- /u/FutureNactiveAccount asks, \"Who is responsible for the government shutdown?\"\n\nLet's explore what the different forces hoped to accomplish by letting it get to this point and whether they have succeeded.  Who stands to gain and lose from the shutdown, both politically and in the general population?  And what does the evidence suggest about the long-term effects of this event?\n\nIs it reasonable for the people to pursue removal or recall of legislators who failed to appropriate funds in time to avoid a shutdown of the government?
