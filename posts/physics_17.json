Because if the Space \"pixels\" is going toward the center of mass carrying any mass that exist along on them, this means that at the center they are just vanishing out letting the matter there, like some sort of space drain, that sucks just the space where the matter exist in, letting the matter there creating gravity, I'm not a physicist so I can't run math abou it, but I just thought, where is all the space being drain by these drains going? They only can be going to an 4th dimension, what mans, a wormhole that only space can be drain, carrying the matter with, but matter it self cannot vanish like space, and this form gravity, and some how, looks like mass create theses drains that only the space falls into. But then I thought, that all the space that are being drain in the universe, could have getting back in somewhere else, creating more and more space, maybe the space pixels that are being drain here on earth could be creating space in the other side of the universe, maybe expanding the universe it self by this, I remember Carl Sagan in cosmos final episode, talking about galaxies looking like they are in a surface of a bubble, like something between galaxies are making they run apart... Then I thought more, that all the pixels spaces there are getting back to the universe, could have more probability to appearing in places with less attraction of gravity, creating even that bubbles, Like energy is more likely to pass where has less resistance. And if space gets suck into a drain, and appear in the other side of the universe, this could be really the wormhole that Einstein predicted in the space-time, but just for space, and no matter! In my mind this theory make so much sense, but I doubt that no one ever thought about it, and if is not even something that I could find in a page on reddit, probably this is totally wrong but that's okay!

It‚Äôs fine to say no or to give your two cents on why I shouldn‚Äôt - but please don‚Äôt attack me for wanting to get into it. If you have nothing nice to say don‚Äôt say it at all, please.\n\nTLDR: 22, paid someone to pass 3 years of high school for me but highly regret it, reasoning for my interest in physics and the universe being triggered was a UAP encounter (you don‚Äôt have to believe - just be nice, and don‚Äôt undermine my experience). I specifically want to go into astrophysics with a dual title in astrobiology (preferably-but not necessary, also have interest in thermodynamics). For a better description of all of this read below:\n\nI‚Äôm 22, 23 soon. I did not TECHNICALLY go to high school past freshman year, I paid someone to pass it for me because I did not realize the value of education at the time (clarifying that this does not mean I do not value it now - again please don‚Äôt be rude). I was a grade level ahead in my math classes from 5th-9th grade before I gave up on school itself, but I suck at arithmetic (meaning multiplication, division, specifically long hand). After HS, I meant to go to college a year after graduation. But I didn‚Äôt apply for almost 2 years and then Covid hit. Am I just too old to start learning everything now even if I start with low level maths? \n\nMy reasoning for getting into physics is mainly due to my own experience with a UAP, which made my outlook on our universe change and made me want to know how such a craft could even exist. It changed my life in a positive way. Afterwards, I got into hard science books, like The Three Body Problem, Excession, and Blindsight, and while these may be sci-fi, and while the physics may be theoretical, it makes me want to understand the terms and the math behind the terms. (Please don‚Äôt be rude - you don‚Äôt have to believe me or in UAPs to see that this is a huge driving force for me - I am putting this here to see if there are people with similar backstories)\n\nMy main concern is ending up underpaid and overworked. I know research positions are very competitive and I am not doing it for the pay but I want to be comfortable (50k+). I am willing to put in the work. What I want to know is if it is worth it, putting in that work, and if I‚Äôm too old to learn advanced maths, and if arithmetic is necessary at all anymore.\n\nThis is the only thing I can see myself being truly fulfilled by long term. I‚Äôve avoided picking another major for a year now because in my heart I know this is it for me but I‚Äôm scared. I don‚Äôt LOVE math, I‚Äôm no mathematician, but I do like problem solving, and I know I‚Äôll love learning something new every week at work, and researching something important to me, even if that means using maths to learn and understand it.",

        "text": "Hello  \nA non science graduate here. My 1st post. I'm interested in the Forces involved in various exercises.\n\nSome Forces are rudimentary:  \n1.Gravitational force for example. We always make sure our resistance (barbell/ dumbbell etc) moves in the line of gravity so that my muscles always face resistance.   \n1a. So a Squat with a Barbell makes sense. The barbell weight is always moving against gravitational force and my muscles are challenged properly.\n\n  \n1b. A leg press on a 45\\* angle is not that productive simply because the weight travels in a tangent line Hence we can load more weight on this machine as compared to a Squat (amongst other reasons).\n\n1c.For exercises with a curvi-linear motion, we prefer to do them on a machine because in the that the machine weight plates travel, again, against gravitational force. Lateral raise machines are hence better than with Dumbbells. \n\n2.Now, my confusion is in regarding excises of a rotational nature. Eg. A ball slam against a wall.  \n[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Z48ap9bcSsk](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Z48ap9bcSsk)\n\nIn this, the ball and the rotation of the body are in the Transverse Plane. It is not even close to the line of gravity. So are the Obliques (whose function is to rotate the trunk) challenged at all? I know the Obliques are working to twist the body but does the addition of the ball add any challenge?   \nIf yes- What force are my obliques trying to overcome?\n\n3.Rope ball rotations  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCmcNVWLnes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCmcNVWLnes)\n\nAgain in this are the oblqiues being challenged because of the addition of the tool? What force are the Obliques overcoming? Centrifugal force? (because the ball wants to travel away from the epicentre ..? I don't know..just thinking out aloud over here!).  \n\n\nSo on a nutshell, when we exercise we make our muscles Work by the virtue of them overcoming Gravitational Force and...what other forces?  \nThank you!",

Why is it like that?\n\nMy guess - Is it because of the fact that when a larger surface area of the synthetic material is in contact with the target surface more atoms(of the synthetic material) can cause a charge imbalance in the atoms of the target surface, so that makes it seem like the force is getting added up resulting in the adhesion getting very strong.\n\nI am a layman in physics(high school student freshman) and haven't studied about adhesion yet.\n\nNote - Target surface refers to the surface on which we are sticking the synthetic material.",

Their eigenvalues for some operator L are likewise degenerate at that frequency. My issue arises when I want to project these eigenstates onto a separate basis (Fourier) for other calculations and then return to my original basis. The mapping is no longer unique at this degeneracy point. The matrix M that would describe the mapping from my original basis to a separate basis and back is the identity matrix, but with M\\_{n,n}, M\\_{m,m}, M\\_{n,m}, and M\\_{m,n} equal to 1/sqrt(2). It seems that my basis is overcomplete at this specific frequency only, and I have been struggling to find a meaningful framework in which to deal with this problem.

        "text": "We show that the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) is a powerful instrument in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). LIGO's ability to detect gravitational waves (GWs) from astrophysical sources, such as binary black hole mergers, also provides the potential to detect extraterrestrial mega-technology, such as Rapid and/or Massive Accelerating spacecraft (RAMAcraft). We show that LIGO is sensitive to RAMAcraft of 1 Jupiter mass accelerating to a fraction of the speed of light (e.g. 30\\%) from¬†10‚àí100kpc or a Moon mass from¬†1‚àí10pc. While existing SETI searches can probe on the order of ten-thousand stars for human-scale technology (e.g. radio waves), LIGO can probe all 1011¬†stars in the Milky Way for RAMAcraft. Moreover, thanks to the¬†f‚àí1¬†scaling of RAMAcraft signals, our sensitivity to these objects will increase as low-frequency detectors are developed and improved, allowing for the detection of smaller masses further from Earth. In particular, we find that DECIGO and the Big Bang Observer (BBO) will be about 100 times more sensitive than LIGO, increasing the search volume by 106, while LISA and Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) may improve sensitivities to objects with long acceleration periods. In this paper, we calculate the waveforms for linearly-accelerating RAMAcraft in a form suitable for LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA searches and provide the range for a variety of masses and accelerations. We expect that the current and upcoming GW detectors will soon become an excellent complement to the existing SETI efforts.\n\nComments:20 pages, 12 figures, submitted to MNRAS, comments welcomeSubjects:Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)Cite as:arXiv:2212.02065¬†[astro-ph.IM]¬†(or¬†arXiv:2212.02065v2¬†[astro-ph.IM]¬†for this version)¬†https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2212.02065",
