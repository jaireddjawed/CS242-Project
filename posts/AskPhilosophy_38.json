        "text": "Obligatory excuse for my bad English: In Human, All-Too-Human Nietzsche develops the idea of moral irresponsibility. To quote him (Human, All-Too-Human, Aph. 39): \"No one is responsible for his deeds, no one for his being; to judge is identical with to be unjust.\"\nTo better understand Nietzsche's position, I had read an essay that states that in order to understand Nietzsche's view of responsibility, one must understand his stance about free will (see source of the essay on the bottom).\nNietzsche denies free will and claims that the question of free will is already wrongly posed. Free will is a question of \"weak\" and \"strong\" will.\nMy question now is: if I understand correctly, Nietzsche makes a shift from moral irresponsibility to strong and weak will, which has no morality. But wouldn't that then be a shift in the matter, rather than a rejection? Instead of \"moral irresponsibility of all and everything,\" we would say of people that they just have weak wills, but are still morally responsible. Or am I missing something?\n\n(Essay source: https://www.jstor.org/stable/24360995?seq=27#metadata_info_tab_contents)",

Time is relative like distance and speed. Satellites need to be updated due to their distance from Earth as time moves at different rates, or our GPS would become more and more inaccurate by the day. \n\nTo say it is a made up concept seems like saying distance or speed is too. Sure, the units we measure with would be made up, but you are measuring something. Maybe categorizing things is a human concept (by all means I guess you could also see things as a jumble of particles and energy and the self is an illusion), but there would be things that fit the definition of the category, so it would seem false to say it just doesn't exist and nothing is being measured. Maybe it moves linearly or doesn't (last I heard it might not but this is above my understanding).\n\nI was just wondering if there are arguments against these points that I just haven't seen? Maybe something way more 'meta'? Or has this largely been dismissed as an idea? I like the idea that something we feel we engage with everyday could not have proof of existing though.

        "text": "To preface, I am much better read on Kierkegaard than I am on Camus. From my understanding of it, Camus' conception of the Absurd is Metaphysical in nature, defined by the (innate?) human desire for meaning and the universe's silence to that desire:\n\n&gt;What, then, is that incalculable feeling that deprives the mind of the sleep necessary to life? A world that can be explained even with bad reasons is a familiar world. But, on the other hand, in a universe suddenly divested of illusions and lights, man feels an alien, a stranger. His exile is without remedy since he is deprived of the memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised land. This divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting, is properly the feeling of **absurdity**. (*The Myth of Sisyphus*, pg. 6)\n\nor, put more simply:\n\n&gt;The **absurd** is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world. (*The Myth of Sisyphus*, pg. 28)\n\nKierkegaard('s pseudonyms), on the other hand, seem(s) to describe the Absurd in terms of Logical Paradox. In *Fear and Trembling*, Johannes de silentio describes the Absurd as the idea that the Individual could have a higher ethical standing than the Universal, in contrast to his Hegelian conception of Ethics:\n\n&gt;He acts on the strength of the **absurd**; for it is precisely the **absurd** that as the single individual he is higher than the universal. This paradox cannot be mediated; for as soon as he tries Abraham will have to admit that he is in a state of temptation, and in that case he will never sacrifice Isaac, or if he has done so he must return repentantly to the universal. On the strength of the **absurd** he got Isaac back. (pg. 85, Hannay trans.)\n\nAdditionally, in *Philosophical Crumbs*, Johannes Climacus writes on the Paradox (of God taking human form in Jesus) and its relation to the Absurd, saying:\n\n&gt;The expression of offence is that the moment is foolishness, the paradox is foolishness, which is really the claim of the paradox that the understanding is the **absurd**, but which resonates within, and thus appears to come from, the offence. Or the moment is constantly approaching, one *regards* it, and the moment is supposed to be *highly regarded*, but since the paradox has made the understanding into the **absurd**, the estimation of the understanding means nothing.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Offence remains outside the paradox, and the reason is ***quia absurdum***. It is not the understanding, however, that has discovered this; on the contrary, the paradox has discovered it and now testifies against offence. The understanding says that the paradox is the **absurd**, but this is only a distorted imitation because the paradox is the paradox ***quia absurdum***. (pg. 123, Piety trans.)\n\nIn this case, the Paradox is certainly absurd (*quia absurdum*), but is not itself the Absurd. It is the Understanding which, by judging (estimating) the Paradox as absurd, expresses Offence and constitutes the Absurd. Although these works offer differing accounts of the Absurd, both are brought up in relation to Paradox and, from my understanding, are more properly Logical issues rather than the Metaphysical one described by Camus.\n\nAre these proper interpretations of Camus' and Kierkegaard's conceptions of the Absurd? Besides similar naming convention, how are these two concepts related?",

Modern warfare, with guns and bombs everywhere. So let's consider a lot of casualties.\nCountry A are willing to conquer country B. So they killed a lot of country B's soldiers in the war. And not just that, country A's soldiers are blood thirsty and brutal, they rap*d country B's women and kill a lot of innocent people. Raid the citizens' house and belongings. Thousand of people died in this war, and most of them are not soldiers but a normal bystander. People lost their loved ones, family and home \nA lot of generations have passed, now country B is a fully conquered colony of country A. Now, the new generation of country A is no more a blood thirsty barbarian and are civilized by proper education. Imagine them as Japanese after WW2.\nMost of them are full of hope, dream and passion. Who carried their family to a brand new environment, the colony B, for a new opportunity to have a better life at a new place. Many of them gathered together and created a caring community where people help eachother at different life problems \nAnd now, there's a person, who was a country B's local. Who is full in rage onto country A, the conquerer who merciless murdered many of his compatriots in the past. Now they're invading his beloving land and make a life here. \nSo, he has a plan to teach those invaders a lesson. \nOne eventful day, a caring husband took his beautiful wife and cute daughter to the colony B, where he would be living a brand new life. With a new job that's able to feed his family, he can finally turn a new leaf. \nThe local man, full of rage, tightly holding a bag full of C4 in his hand. Waiting for his opportunity. Like a hunter waiting for his prey to finally fall into the trap. \nAnd eventually, the crowd started to gather. As a local circus show is now held at the center of the public. People gathered around, attached by the show. And the husband, his daughter is begging her father to allow her to watch the circus show. The man have no choice but to let her go. Still a bit worried, he asked his wife to accompany his daughter. \nBoom. \nThe C4 was detonated in the crowd. 70 deaths was confirmed, among the many deaths, is the man's family. The local man, satisfied by his doing. Turned himself to the police. \nOn the media, they call the local man a monster, who murdered a lot of innocent lives. \nIn the eyes of the locals, he is at country's hero, who finally managed to bring country B a sweet little revenge. \nEnd of the story \nSo, now, is the big question. Who the local man really is? A monster? \nOr a hero?",

Problem is that idea involves and is supported by so many different topics that I end up losing myself in the literature, because each thing takes me down an infinite rabbit hole. Also, any time I find good evidence against a supporting idea, that means my research question needs to change cause all of a sudden one of the initial pillars is gone. And it just keeps going like that until I completely lose touch with what I want to say.\n\nI have tried to limit myself and focus on fewer notions, but still I am taken down the same rabbit hole and end up doing so poorly that I get discouraged about actually being able to continue studying, even though I love it.\n\nIf anyone resonates at all or has any advice I would really really appreciate it, I am kind of at my wits' end",

        "text": "&gt;The truth is the whole. However, the whole is only the essence completing itself through its own development. This much must be said of the absolute: It is essentially a result, and only at the end is it what it is in truth. Its nature consists precisely in this: To be actual, to be subject, that is, to be the becoming-of itself. As contradictory as it might seem, namely, that the absolute is to be comprehended essentially as a result, even a little reflection will put this mere semblance of contradiction in its rightful place. The beginning, the principle, or the absolute as it is at first, that is, as it is immediately articulated, is merely the universal. But just as my saying “all animals” can hardly count as an expression of zoology, it is likewise obvious that the words, “absolute,” “divine,” “eternal,” and so on, do not express what is contained in them;—and it is only such words which in fact express intuition as the immediate. Whatever is more than such a word, even the mere transition to a proposition, is a becoming-other which must be redeemed, that is, it is a mediation. However, it is this mediation which is rejected with such horror as if somebody, in making more of mediation than in claiming both that it itself is nothing absolute and that it in no way exists in the absolute, would be abandoning absolute cognition altogether. \n\nThis is from the Phenomenology of Spirit",

About an analogy I made concerning the term TERF as a potential slur (acronym for trans-exclusionary radical feminist).\n\nPersonally I do consider the term a slur, but the point is irrelevant for the analogy in my opinion and not the discussion I intend to have.\n\nThe person said:\n\n&gt;they fluctuate from 'its a slur!!!!' to calling themselves that   they cant even agree on their own little cult\n\nWhich I compared to black people calling themselves the n-word.\n\nNow, obviously I‘m not saying the terms are equally horrible, nor am I arguing TERF is necessary a slur in the first place. \n\nAll the analogy is supposed to point out is that there is no contradiction there; that you can use a term for yourself and others and still think it’s a slur, and it still objectively being a slur.\n\nThat the fact that a group is using it for themselves is not undermining the claim that it’s a slur or that they perceive it as such.\n\nYou can make that analogy without thinking TERF is a slur, to simply point out that this is not a legitimate argument. If it was, you could say the same about black or gay people; „they‘re using it themselves,  they can’t even decide whether it’s a slur or not.“ But no decent, rational person would make that argument.\n\nAll I got from the other side was that my analogy doesn’t work because the n-word is a slur and TERF isn‘t (seems circular reasoning to me from the other side. I leave it open whether it is or isn’t, as an unresolved dispute, it simply doesn’t matter to my argument.) They said I‘m equating the terms (I‘m not).\n\nCleatly the analogy wants to point out the nonsensicalness of that argument, TERF needn’t be a slur to make that point. Nor does it have to be even remotely as horrific as the n-Word as a *potential* slur.\n\nAnalogies usually  have disanalogies within them, the question is whether the analogy breaks down because of it, or whether a disanalogy is relevant to the point being made.\n\nAnd it seems to me the analogy works perfectly to show that the claim made is not a legitimate argument.\n\nWhat do people here think?",

        "text": "This isn't extremely well written, messy in some parts, wrote it at 5AM last night but you get the picture:\n\n• In the world, we have religions such as Christianity, Islam, Judaism, etc\n• We call them belief systems bc they have belief in Christ, Allah, or a higher power in general\n• For them, though - the followers or, believers of said religion - it is reality. You cannot convince a true Christian or Muslim God or Allah doesn't exist. No matter how hard you try. It is their reality. \n• To us (non believers), it is a belief. We can understand why they believe in what they do, but can't bring ourselves to believe in it for whatever the reason might be. \n• You can claim to be an Athiest, but obviously there is no way to truly tell - the same way the followers of these religions cannot truly know that their God exists - but the belief they have in their God is what keeps their God real to them. \n• And to clarify, an agnostic is someone who doesn't believe nor disbelieve in a higher power as they have accepted there is no way to truly know.\n• So, then, it can be said that one could be agnostic towards reality itself. That there is no way to prove nor disprove reality, so therefore are agnostic to the concept of said reality. \n• One could argue that the proof is all around us that reality is real - the same way a Christian would point to the world around us as proof of a grand creator - but what's to say this isn't an illusion?\n• Sure, you can see the trees planted in the ground, feel the jagged roughness of a rock, smell every different scent in the air, taste amazing flavours and hear beautiful music; but how do you truly know that this is reality? \n• Our brains can be tricked so easily into believing invalid distortions; 2 drinks could have the exact same ingredients, but the smell associated with these drinks can vastly change the perceived taste. \n• So why is it so ludicrous to feel agnostic towards reality? Maybe it's a simulation, maybe it's a form of heaven or hell, maybe this reality is made up from your real brain - doing what it needs to do before it finally stops. \n• I'm not claiming to have the answer of if this is true reality, just questioning why more people don't question it",

However I’m this video game I’m playing there are no real rules except the laws of physics. Lately, in a need to defend myself I’ve discovered a new method of diplomacy. In Spanish slang, it’s plata o plomo - silver or lead. The only 3 ways to get what you want are to make it, trade for it, or take it. I used to try reasoning with the parties involved with the legal evidence needed for them to take me seriously. Since then, they’ve come to accept my evidence but only after this method of diplomacy was used which makes me think this is a valid option for getting what I want but I still don’t want people to get hurt. I just don’t have any rules in this game that prevent me from hurting people and as it becomes more and more of a reasonable alternative I can’t seem to find a way to keep both the belief that it is ok to hurt people in self defense and the belief that there are no rules to life. After all, if there are rules that makes this whole world an unjust place. Believing the world is unjust makes me extremely depressed. I think everyone is equal so if other people can act unjustly then why shouldn’t I in the pursuit of my other goals as well as in self defense so long as I do it legally? My goals are not less noble than theirs (from my perspective). It just feels really bad to hurt people in any way but because I see it’s usefulness I can’t get rid of using the idea again.

        "text": "I always considered myself a consequentialist but having come up with a hypothetical for an essay, I am struggling to provide an adequate, consequentialist answer. Here is the scenario: \n\nSuppose you have been transported back to the US state of Georgia in the 1740s. Your father, a slave-trader, is retiring and looking to hand his business over to you. Given it’s a small operation, you constitute but a minute-fraction of the transatlantic slave-trade. Thus, whether you choose to take up the business or not, the same amount of slaves will be brought over to the Americas, where they suffer immeasurably (i.e., your actions won’t affect the consequences felt by the slaves as it is an issue of collective harm). Is it a moral wrong to continue your father’s business?\n\nI can’t seem to give a consequentialist-based answer as to why we should say this is a moral wrong. My intuition says this is obviously a wrong thing, but I can only come up with the non-consequentialist line of thought that ‘slave-trading is bad in virtue of itself’. \n\nI guess you can say something along the lines of ‘taking up this business sends the signal that slave trading is permissible and so will encourage more people to do it’ but that seems besides the point. When people object to slavery, they don’t say ‘one shouldn’t do it as it might encourage others’. For arguments sake, let’s suppose you take up this business in secret so no one can be influenced by your actions. What then? \n\nAny replies appreciated 👍🏻",

The thing I don’t understand is how he can claim that morality is irrational when he recognizes the fact that morality has a utilitarian basis. If we do a good action because it will increase goodness in ourselves and in the world, isn’t that perfectly rational?",

After removing the scratchers I planned to throw away immediately, as I thought they were worthless, I noticed about 90% of each ticket remained unscratched. Thinking back on it, my friend had been very drunk that night and probably didn't understand how scratchers worked. He thought he had won nothing, even though he couldn't have known with the little information he had revealed.\n\nAs I was curious, I finished scratching them. As it turns out, two tickets won $1 each, netting a $2.00 payout. I have already explained the situation to my friend and will give him his two winning tickets. I noticed one of the possible prizes was a million dollars, and that got me thinking: what if one of those tickets had won a million dollars?

Out of my own free will, I clearly stated no and that I am not interested, yet the Christian is still here trying to change my view. Does this now not create a forceful interaction with the objective of converting the target? Christianity naturally teaches that God supplies everybody with free will. So, if a Christian is trying to consistently change my view after I declared that I am not interested and I denied interest or wanting to convert, does this not go against the free will that was assigned to me? It seems rather contradicting? So, would this be viewed as a sin, as it could potentially be going against God's naturally assigned concepts?\n\nFor the record, I do not believe in God.

Shelly Kagan's What's wrong with Speciesism points out that Singer, too, resorted to instincts in proposing only sentient agents have moral standing.\n\nShelly Kagan \"defended\" a view that ( probably ) most of us agree on with the concept of \"Modal Personism\", but seem to still resort to instincts.

He truly was one of the best teachers I've ever had, as he always had very complex and thorough answers and explanations that were very \"philosophically satisfactory\".\n\nUnfortunately I never got to hear what his answer to this question was, because I had to quit philosophy due to some logistic mess with combinations of classes, and I never ran into him again. I can't remember nor find his name anywhere - if I could I would have reached out.\n\nI'm not against the idea of taking care of the \"weakest\" (persons who can't contribute to society much or at all due to physical and/or mental limitations), but I can't come up with a straight/simple answer why if someone would have asked. The lesson was about Hitler and some other political and philosophical figures, which is why that was the nature of his question.\n\nHis question went along the lines of: \"If a society is about everyone contributing with what they can, why do we take care of the ones who can't, and not just get rid of them?\"\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "text": "In the myth of Sisyphus, Camus says (paraphrasing) that it is in his revolt against the absurdity that man regains his majesty. Surely the basic definition of majesty would imply a minor contradiction as he believes that there is no objective aesthetic value. So he must mean something else by the word majesty (which he’s used in twice; to me, this indicates that it’s of importance). Can someone clear up what he means by man’s majesty?",
