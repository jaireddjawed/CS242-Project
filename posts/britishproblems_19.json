I swear it shrinks every year. One day they will just be called Cakes. Sponge tastes like bathroom sponge.\n\nHeinz Ketchup is a sugary, watery red mess that pales in comparison to the newer alternatives that actually taste like tomatoes, and cheapens the taste of any decent dinner.\n\nWalkers are crap, compared to the massive selection of hand cooked options available, they are truly pathetic. Gary Lineker is so embarrassed even he fucked off from the ads.\n\nCadbury tastes of sugary dogshit, and with stuff like Tony's now available, I won't eat it again. Burns the top of your mouth for some wierd reason. Probably some wank new US ingredient to further cut costs.\n\nRobinsons gives me a fucking migraine from all the sweeteners. If your kids are having random headaches, this is the reason.\n\nGreggs is warm sloppy matter, shoved in a white paper bag made of that shiny public toilet bog roll. They also make clothes for morons to give them free advertising. \n\nTheir sausage rolls are idolised to the point that some absolute berk and a famous ginger wanker made Christmas number one singing about them because they know simpletons will go 'heh hehe its a song about susuge rolls heh he I luv susage rolls he he' and throw money at them.\n\nI don't know why people still idolise these massive brands when the quality has dropped so far and the standard elsewhere has been raised so high. Even co-op's own branded food tastes far superior. \n\nWe've been brainwashed since we where kids to think these are 'great british brands' to be proud of, when all they really are is shite",

It seeps into my kitchen and front room and makes me feel sick and gives me headaches. Its getting to the point now where its continuous, they are smoking maybe 8 times a day? if not more.\n\nWe complained before, and the manager of the building put out a letter to all apartments about smoking inside the building and the smell of weed.\n\nThey stopped for about 4 months and now have started again with vengeance\n\nIts honestly upsetting, I own my flat, but having to deal with the constant smell is awful, especially when we have guests. We cant even eat at our dinner table, without smelling it.\n\nI would rather not confront them as when they found out someone complained before, they went mental, the guy has serious anger issues and even punched a wall in the shared stairway wall.\n\nShould I complain to the building manager again? Is there anything else i can do?",
