As I said in the previous article, Marado's birds must be protected, and wild cats that destroy the ecosystem must be eliminated from Marado. Please agree with my petition and help me. \n\nWe don't have much time left. If you love the Earth's ecosystem and animals, please help Marado's birds.",

What are some similarities? Could Frisson interactions contain the same intrinsic properties as Nuclear Fission, only done differently? Its interesting seeing how sound and vibrations effect our very emotion, our very tempo, the entire way we exist and traverse this plane of reality. \n\nIs there something I am missing? I'm asking you all because you are smart, and have a fresh outlook on the idea.  Quantum mechanics and string theory have yet to be disproven, and show that the universe is musical stings being plucked. What if science is too? What if all we need is a combination of frequencies at proper decible rates, targeted at the right area, to emit the proper effect? Histotripsy, Creationism. 2 sides of the same coin.\n\n This might be too hypothetical or crackpot, I am sorry in advance.",

It's just for my presentation tomorrow and I'm kinda whipping it up from anything I can find on the moment. But I'm getting dizzy with all this information in the net. Some say Shrimps have CNS while Prawns do not but some sources say they do, although there is not much info on the shrimps.",
