        "text": "I think there is a good argument in favor of social safety nets, social programs, and livable wages as if poor people are paid adequately and support it adequately, all of those resources go back into the economy again in the long run. This is because poor people tend to spend larger amounts of their income than wealthier people do, which promotes a healthy economy, and also because in helping them reach their potential, we're essentially investing in these people so later on down the line they're more likely to succeed. This in turn benefits the economy as well.\n\nThe thing is that everyone with a finance and economics background that I've ever talked to wholeheartedly disagrees with this view. According to them, wealth inequality is both unavoidable and not a bad thing and they tend to think that eliminating it will do much more harm than good as the top 1% will take their wealth of the country and put it in tax havens or that kind of thing if progressive taxation were to be introduced. Their first response to dealing with any of our economic woes is to axe social programs, reduce public spending, and basically cut any sort of protection that is costly yet exists to benefit poor people. They can't see the good or point in any of these things and seem to think these programs are the same as burning money. \n\nIt reeks of trickle down economics to me, yet every time I talk to people with an economics background, even though most are socially progressive and most would put themselves at least in the middle of the political spectrum, they all tend to think this way. They also almost always think that unions are bad and that the minimum wage is bad and should be set to zero. Do they teach these things in universities? \n\nI've done my research into all of these things independently, despite not having a finance or economics background, and I never reach the same conclusions that they do. I always come to the conclusion that safety nets and protections for poor and working people are a good thing in every regard, including economically. ",

        "text": "I will try to illustrate my current feeling of complete powerlessness in a geographical layer model: \n\n\\*Layer 1\\*\n\nI live in a multi storage house in the first floor. We rent, the neighbor above me owns his flat and when he bought it, kicked out a family that lived there before. He is the most obnoxious prick I ever had as a neighbor. Doesn't greet you, moves around like a trampling elephant, has parties during workdays. \n\n\\*Layer 2\\*\n\nI live in a city street where parking is a huge problem because European cities weren't built for each family to own 2 SUVs. Cars park on the pavement blocking ramps for wheelchair users for example and taking away space from pedestrians.\n\n\\*Layer 3\\*\n\nI live in a district where we have a problem with street racing. Rich kids undertake races with their expensive cars through the city. Last year someone died in a car crash caused by one of these races. The rich kids also park their cars where they please because the fine for them is just pocket change. \n\n\\*Layer 4\\*\n\nI live in a city where rents increased by 100&amp;#37; (at least) in the last decade. There is not enough room for ordinary people or families anymore. Rich people are buying houses as \"assets\", the city is in huge debts and tries to stop the tide of incoming investors but is ultimately powerless. The infrastructure is collapsing under extreme increase of new residents over the last 10 years.\n\n\\*Layer 5\\*\n\nI live in a part of a country that used to be very poor. Industry moved away 20-30 years ago, blue collar workers are pissed and start voting for the right wing populists. The comparatively small influx of migrants is blamed for everything even though it is pretty obvious that they didn't make the decision to move away blue collar jobs in the 1990s nor is the affordable housing connected to them. \n\n\\*Layer 6\\*\n\nI live in a country so scared of the blue collar workers voting for the right wing populists, that we forget to tackle problems like education, housing, infrastructure, social equality, unemployment, pensions, healthcare, all of which are problems that will only make the situation worse for people who don't have money to begin with right now and will further threaten the social peace.\n\n\\*Layer 7\\*\n\nI live on a continent that was ravaged by wars some 70-100 years ago. That built up a diplomatic and economic system with a strict moral compass that tries to prevent this while also guaranteeing prosperity for all. That system has eroded or might even collapse in the near future. \n\n\\*Layer 8\\*\n\nI live on a part of the planet that thought 1989 marked \"the end of history\" but woke up to a new millennium that clearly showed this wasn't the case. \n\n\\*Layer 9\\*\n\nI live on a planet suffering from climate change, extreme pollution; gigantic problems that would need a huge amount of global cooperation, yet I can't even convince my neighbor upstairs to be considerate of the people living below him or convince people in my street that buying an SUV in a city is a stupid idea.

Why is this such a common trope to being with? Those 3 things don't necessarily conflict with each other and it's very possible to be a fan of all 3 subjects. Heck even sports can be an academic and artistic interest. What started this whole shenanigans to begin with? I myself like sports and am a huge buff of many academic and artistic things, they never seem to go against with my values or philosophy. ",

This of course includes a ton of other films that portray America and warfare in a more ugly manner like Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July and so on)\n\nThis trend has existed for a long time such as in films like \n\n- Top Gun\n\n- The Hunt for Red October (note that Tom Clancy basically popularised or even invented the cheesy action military story)\n\n- The Hurt Locker\n\n- The Patriot (A VERY historically inaccurate film)\n\n- White House Down\n\n- The Rock\n\n- Red Dawn \n\n... and so on\n\nThis is quite ironic as America has a complicated history of imperialism (for example it has military bases all over the world) and complicated political history when it comes to conflict and even justification of such conflict (such as the expansion of America in the early 19th Century which also lead to even genocide of the Native Americans) and of course, the involvement of America in both the First and Second World War and so on.\n\nDespite that many people today complain a lot about America despite its benefits in its culture, there is this image that America is the greatest country in the world and the heroes of the modern world, whether it is politically, militarily or sometimes even economically when in actuality, it is either the opposite or it is way more complicated than how it is portrayed in pop culture or common depictions",

        "text": "This mostly came to mind after reading about Nietzsche and his arguments \n\nSo based on my interpretation of Nietzsche so far was his views of individuality and passion and willpower based on his views towards Christianity and the shared values and morals that humans possess which he brought about the concept of the Ubermench, the will to power and the dualistic concept of Dionysian and Apollonisin concepts in philosophy. He is quite different than other philosophers as from the Enlightenment era, there was a strong trend directing towards rationality.\n\nBut judging by Nietzcshe alone, he is very difficult to intepret and understand clearly and one of this is his anti-rationalist views.\n\nI can somewhat agree with this as philosophy makes me think time and time again but I often end up thinking and ruminating and trying to take the rational approach without ever actually acting or doing anything or even feeling the moment which reflects Nietzsche's views that we are being too Apollonian and neglecting our Dionysian side.\n\n\nEven when he mentioned his \"live dangerously\" quote and his \"in the remote corner of the universe, a group of creators invented knowing\", I still kind of relate to it becuase I mostly rely way too much on objective truths without relying too much on truths that make sense to me and in the end, it makes me feel lost in the process as well without having my own sense of direction or passion in life\n\n(when I mean about objective truths, I am mostly referring to the continuous rise on the trust towards science and their verifiable evidence about the universe around us. But of course, nothing is ever as straight-forward as what certain sciences say because they either contradict each other or some evidence was not found yet meaning that whatever you felt to be discovered or explained is felt for interpretation and only time can tell. Not saying that we should not rely on science but what I am trying to say is that the focus on objective truths is so great that we are not living our lives as we want it to be)\n\n\nThink of it like this because it is difficult to explain\n\nThere are many things that I am unsure about the universe and there are many things that we think about the universe in multiple perspectives. But becuase of this, it makes it more complicated for us and difficult for us to make sense of our lives too. \n\nI rely mostly too much on what the science says especially when it comes to things that I am not sure about and when certain difficult situations occur, I often wait what sciences say instead of living my life as how I wish to be.\n\n(Put it this way. Relying on verifiable evidence is one thing but waiting until there is enough evidence can also really press my buttons and it gives me a very irritating feeling that I feel that I have to wait until what the evidence says and gives me the feeling that I am letting my life become dictated or commanded by others, even though I know that relying on verifiable evidence, at least the evidence found so far, is of the best intentions. So sometimes I believe in things or do things out of impulse even though my gut tells me that it is not right)\n\nLike for example, I am mostly certain that spirituality does not exist and mostly see it like a semi-mystical entity but at the same time, I really do like the spirit of spirituality - it feels soothing and mysterious and creative and have different interpretations for different people. There is a certain je ne sais quoi to it",
