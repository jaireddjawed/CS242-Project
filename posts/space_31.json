        "text": "Complex organic molecules have been found on Mars and on some of the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn, such as Enceladus and Titan. These molecules include compounds such as hydrocarbons, amino acids and sugars, which are the basic building blocks of life on Earth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the case of Mars, the detection of organic molecules was made by NASA's Curiosity rover, which identified organic compounds in rock samples collected on Mars. In 2018, the InSight spacecraft also detected signs of a seismic tremor on Mars, which allowed scientists to study the planet's internal structure and discover that Mars may have a crust rich in organic compounds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegarding the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn, NASA's Cassini spacecraft made several surprising discoveries during its mission to Saturn. In 2005, Cassini detected jets of water and ice particles coming off the moon Enceladus, and later discovered that the moon has an underground ocean of salt water. In 2004, the probe discovered that the moon Titan's atmosphere is rich in hydrocarbons, and in 2007, Cassini found complex organic molecules in Titan's atmosphere, including compounds that could provide energy for life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile these organic molecules are not definitive evidence of extraterrestrial life, they do suggest that the chemical elements necessary for life may be present elsewhere in our solar system. The study of these molecules is important for astrobiology and exobiology, which seek to understand the possibilities and limitations of life in the universe, including the possibility of life forms based on elements other than carbon.",

        "text": "So I've been doing a lot of surfing, looking at the fact that Mars for example has no magnetosphere, and a \"dead\" core that is not hot enough and/or doesn't spin independently to the other planetary layers. I saw that some people theorized we could detonate a large nuclear fusion payload inside the core (assuming we are able to reach it) to \"restart\" the magnetic dynamo effect by reheating the core layers so convection can occur. People usually point out that this would probably just make a mess instead of a magnetic field, because it wouldn't create spin on the core, because that is only generated by a moon of significant mass. \n\nSo theoretically, would it be possible to \n\n - Bring Ceres to Mars to provide tidal stress on the core and establish an independent spin\n\n- Nuke the core with a high-efficiency fusion bomb to liquefy it all enough for magnetic convection\n\n? \n\nThe same principle could possibly be used to bring Mercury to Venus and spin the planet's core as well. Venus already has plenty of geothermal energy, but none of it spins to create magnetism. Ofc Venus is different, Mars and Earth coincidentally rotate at almost the same rate but Venus barely does at all. So we may have to first tackle the hurdle of accelerating the rotation, I saw some things about how potentially orbiting something around it at 10 percent lightspeed could do that in 30 years. \n\nThe only other rocky body with a significant magnetic field is Ganymede, I'm not sure if it's strong enough to protect from the radiation of Jupiter though. But we could use Ganymede to study how we can get a magnetic field on a similarly sized object like Mars. Personally I think figuring out how to do it organically like this is a cooler option than having something at L1 generating its own electromagnetosphere, regardless of the short-term practical superiority and necessity. Mostly I think this because an artificial magnetic field would require a ton of energy to maintain and it may be prone to mechanical failure. A superconductor belt is a cool idea though. \n\nAlso I'm kinda fuzzy on what exactly creates a planetary magnetic field. If it was simply tidal forces and heat required we would probably see more bodies with a magnetic field, (Titan, Triton especially, Io) so idk. I saw people discuss how it is possible Earth's core just has a lot of radioactive material creating a georeactor, separating us. If that is true we would need to buy time on the geological scale by injecting massive amounts of radioactive material into a core (not feasible). Maybe we will never really know until we are able to do in-depth geological surveys on these planets.\n\nSo I'm really just curious if y'all believe it is theoretically possible to organically jump start and maintain a planetary dynamo. Please keep in mind that I don't really care about how \"ridiculously implausible\" it is for our current civilization to achieve, I'm just interested in the theoretical. I feel like if we can figure this out, then humanity in say 2,000 years could be living across 3 Earths in our system with Venus and Mars both terraformed. That'd be crazy.",
