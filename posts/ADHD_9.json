I really think I should change that and get back to 3 square meals.\n\nBut I don't know why I have weeks when I'm just not feeling it at all and will stay I front of my computer for hours past the point of hunger because, I don't know. I'm not anorexic, if food is easily available or offered to me I eat with gusto. I just really hate doing the dishes but I don't have a choice obviously (an electric dish washer is not an option).\n\nI usually exercise on a semi empty stomach cause after eating I feel a bit too sluggish and just wanna nap, so I'll sometimes push past hunger to train but afterwards I do need to eat, and I'm wondering if I'm getting enough calories.\n\nI know meds can sometimes screw up appetite but I'm inconsistent with my meds anyways and I've been off my meds since last November anyways.\n\nI just don't know, I like getting inspiration for cooking but when it's time to do it I just procrastinate.",

My prescription this past month was from the same Walgreens but the brand was Mallenkrodt and it was AWFUL. I noticed the capsules looked different as soon as I opened the bottle, I looked it up and every single thing I read was negative. I was scared but I figured I would give it a try for myself and sure enough, it had little to no effect on me, I had massive migraines all day, I was extremely anxious and irritable, and the list goes on.\n\nLUCKILY, I found an old bottle of a pre-shortage Sandoz prescription that I had hid in my closet (and forgot where I hid it) about a year ago.  It had 11 capsules in it which truly saved me this month, I have one left that I’m saving for a rainy day. It was time to pick up my new prescription this month and I was crossing my fingers it wouldn’t be Mallenkrodt again, but when I opened the bottle the capsules were a clear pink color instead of the normal orange and white that I have got with even different generic brands. This was a little scary but I knew it wasn’t Mallenkrodt so that was a relief. \n\nSo my my new prescription is Lannett, and after a little research (which I know I shouldn’t do), I’ve seen very mixed reviews on this specific brand. I have a little hope after seeing some people saying they prefer it but there is also some people who say it’s completely useless. I’m wondering if anyone has any experience with this brand at all, or any generic Adderall xr brands that you’ve had good experiences with?",

When I was young I did not put any thought into it, I just saw something I liked that belonged to a friend or someone at school and I took it. This obviously ended up causing me a lot of problems with my parents and socially, and I was bullied because of it and felt shame for a very long time. At a certain point when I got a little older I would say it became more of an addiction, and then when I became a substance user it fed my addictions. Thankfully now I am clean over 6 years and have not stolen anything since. \n\nMy thought was, it now seems likely that the stealing in my childhood could have been a result of the impulsivity symptom of my ADHD, as opposed to having just been a dishonest, broken and “bad” kid. Please please share if any of you went through something remotely similar, I’d be very interested to hear if this is more common in neurotypical children than otherwise.",

I feel lazy doing just “enough.”\n\nAnd as I take work home each night, or instead get behind, I realized that these are probably all downstream sequelae from untreated ADHD.  Everything has been hard my whole life so if it isn’t hard I make it hard. And if it is simple / easy, I’m bored and overthink it 100 ways to make it more interesting. \n\nBut this attitude that if it’s easy / short, I am being lazy, needs to go! I don’t want to be an ADHD perfectionist workaholic. I’m now on adderall and working with an adhd therapist, but wondering if others relate.",

It’s a pretty big place so I wasn’t too worried but then I forgot when I had gone, what day I went. I thought I had gone yesterday night but I went on Saturday night and I forgot what day it was. I was confused and I kept apologizing to my dad for forgetting about when I came. It frustrates me so much because I really panicked when I couldn’t remember and he had to tell me. I’ve tried writing stuff down and setting reminders but sometimes I just forget and time flies too quickly and it also doesn’t help I have sleepless nights and am very tired when I wake up. I want to know what else I could do to try and not forget things that easily",

Obviously, adderall is impossible to find right now and it just didn’t seem to be the right fit for me any more. I was nervous to say anything to my doctor because my past doctor (who I switched to after being on adderall for several years already) basically lectured me when I started with her and she told me my body would never build a tolerance to adderall and not to ever tell her that was the case. Luckily, I have recently found a doctor I felt comfortable with who assured me that it is normal for it to stop being as efficient. She switched me to Vyvanse due to this and it amplifying my anxiety (which I am also medicated for.) My prescription company (Express Scripts) stopped covering my Adderall about a year and a half ago, even after multiple prior authorizations, and I have been using goodrx to get the adderall for atleast a year. Last week, my prior authorization was approved (and I was shocked) for Vyvanse and today I found out even after this it will cost me $367. I feel truly defeated and infuriated at this point because I absolutely can not afford this, and really do not want to switch back to Adderall. I am simply asking for any advice to lower the price or anything that has worked for anyone.",

        "text": "So I’ve been on adderall for about 5 years now and recently noticed it is had little effect on me and when it does, it amplifies my anxiety x5 when it wears off.  Obviously, adderall is impossible to find right now and it just didn’t seem to be the right fit for me any more. I was nervous to say anything to my doctor because my past doctor (who I switched to after being on adderall for several years already) basically lectured me when I started with her and she told me my body would never build a tolerance to adderall and not to ever tell her that was the case. Luckily, I have recently found a doctor I felt comfortable with who assured me that it is normal for it to stop being as efficient. She switched me to Vyvanse due to this and it amplifying my anxiety (which I am also medicated for.) My prescription company (Express Scripts) stopped covering my Adderall about a year and a half ago, even after multiple prior authorizations, and I have been using goodrx to get the adderall for atleast a year. Last week, my prior authorization was approved (and I was shocked) for Vyvanse and today I found out even after this it will cost me $367. I feel truly defeated and infuriated at this point because I absolutely can not afford this, and really do not want to switch back to Adderall. I am simply asking for any advice to lower the price or anything that has worked for anyone.",

        "text": "I can’t wrap my head around the fact that ADHD is overlooked to this extent. It’s definitively one of the main reasons most of us have gone undiagnosed for years. To me it’s a crippling condition that affects all aspects of my life.\n\nReading a single page of paper takes me forever while I witness my friends finish books in weeks. I’m in grad school and reading journal papers is an essential part of me doing research, and I’m severely struggling with it. I can still remember how my post doc traumatized me by forcing me into reading so many papers when I could have obtained that information from another source. My PhD qualification exam was also tough for this reason.\n\nIn the face of distress, a normal person gets their shit together in a few hours or days, but a minor event is enough to disable me for weeks. I guess we also lack the ability to compartmentalize and confine the problems we face and they leak to other parts of our lives. For me it means getting disabled for weeks, disappearing from real world, ending up with tens of unread emails, not being able to meet deadlines, and not taking actions when I know not doing them is going to put my career or life in peril. I just become a spectator of my life going down to hell and that’s it. I can’t connect to my body and make it function wisely.\n\nIn social life, since the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in my brain won’t activate, I end up bluntly expressing my feelings and emotions which have always ruined my relationships of any sort. ADHD has gifted me with this nice disability that prevents me from being able to navigate social situations. In social settings I’m just a copier, like I’m an alien trying to fake being a human being. Gosh I envy those people who are relaxed enough that are able to crack jokes and be the funny guy in social gatherings. While in contrast, I’ve been called out for being sensitive and having a distinct style of humor. It makes me want to cry and scream that hey, I also could be funny if my anxiety and ADHD didn’t suffocate me. In my mind I’m always engineering conversations. Like, okay I’m gonna say this and then this and then that. And I stop a long time after I get a response. Like I’m talking to someone and they say something and my brain freezes and I’m processing the info and trying to find a proper reply and since it takes a while an awkward silence sets in repeatedly. When I’m fact there’s nothing awkward but my slow brain is leading to that.\n\nTasks that are repetitive bore me instantly. To a point that I literally refuse to do them and damage my life and career. For instance, when I’m doing a homework and two problems are almost the same, for the second one I just write down the important parts and values and just turn it in that way without showing complete work. I don’t even care about my GPA when ideally something in my brain should fire up and make the danger tangible to me. It’s like I have no touch sense and I can easily put my hand in molten iron. \n\nEdited",

I never got to experience any of those cool things people have stated here when they first started taking it, but I’ve become more focused and calm. Also, I have gotten rid of my emotional dysregulation which is awesome. Practically I’m seeing so much benefit from taking this medication but it is coming at a huge cost.

I forgot to bring it up with my doctor, so I called back to get some advice and haven’t heard back yet. So I figured I’d post here. Is it safe for me to continue doing that? I have really good blood pressure and my heart is healthy, I’ve heard that it can drop your blood pressure significantly and I don’t want that happening when I sleep (i was told to start taking it at bedtime). \n\nBefore the guanfacine I was taking 50mg of hydroxyzine at night before bed and did okay with that and cannabis at night, or on the rare occasion I would need it during the day due to an anxiety/panic attack. \n\nAny thoughts?

The medicine covers through my daily work shift, but it's just depressing coming home and having it wear off (which adds to the adderall crash). I've also been having strange side effects, and Im worried my doctors might take me off it entirely. \n\nWhen I'm not on my medication, there's this constant cloud buzzing with distraction around my brain. I get no ability to focus, strong forgetfulness, and the feeling of being overwhelmingly unmotivated. I create big mistakes at work when getting distracted or when required to multitask. I forget important things in my relationships, and lose the clarity and energy to get productive things done.\n\nI've tried Ritalin, or switching to smaller but more spread out doses of Adderall, which didn't help at all. I keep a day planner (which I either forget, or feel too completely unmotivated to use). Alarms, calendars, sticky notes, meditation, habit building, eating better, sleeping better, exercise, etc. I feel completely exhausted by simply trying to focus on normal things for others.\n\nI constantly have to choose whether I want to spend it all at work to not risk my job with all the ineffectiveness and errors caused by my ADHD symptoms, or to use it at home to keep my symptoms from impacting my relationships and prevent me from getting nothing done when I get home. I feel like without medication, all my brain is good for is watching videos and playing video games while being upset the whole time about it and a million other things.\n\nI feel like I'm someone with vision problems who gets to use glasses, but only for 4-6 hours a day when lucky.

        "text": "Have any of you had a similar experience:\n\nI (M21) met this girl (whom I am currently dating) on a dating app about two months ago. During the first couple weeks, we texted and sent voice messages EVERY DAY for multiple hours at a time, even so far as both of us going to bed at 2 AM because of it. I was increasingly becoming more and more excited and attracted to her because of the fact that we are passionate about all the same hobbies/interests/progressive political beliefs. \n\nThen, after about a month or so of talking, we finally met up! I also found her really attractive in person, and we talked for the whole day. Then we met again, this time talking and holding hands for many hours. The third time, we went to a karaoke and made out for like 3 hours.\n\nThen, this past Saturday, we met a fourth time, wherein I went to her house; met her very kind mom; and watched a movie in her bedroom while we made out. We were both incredibly into it, and we couldn’t wait to have sex the next day. We had been excitedly planning to have sex that Sunday for about a week now.\n\nThen, as I got home on Saturday after spending the day at her house, I felt stressed out and exhausted. I hadn’t felt this way with her before. I think all the making out was what made me super tired, but I didn’t know why I felt exhausted—“perhaps there’s such a thing as ‘sexual energy’”, I thought? Maybe I had it all saved up throughout the week, and using it all today like that felt overwhelming to me? I wasn’t sure. Then Sunday came by, and as soon as I woke up, before she even got here, I was a bit stressed because I noticed I wasn’t feeling any ‘horniness’/sexual desire. We then had sex that afternoon (it was both of us’ first time), and she noticed I was feeling nervous during it, which I was. But I also noticed that towards the end of the sex, I wasn’t feeling any sexual desire whatsoever, despite having been into it and enjoyed it. I had also found it hard to stay hard throughout it, even though I found her very pretty. She would be cuddling with me and making sounds while I just… lay there. Looking forward to this being finished, and thinking about what movie we would watch afterwards. \n\nAfter we were done and we sat on my couch watching a movie, she kept cuddling with me and kissing me and looking at me, while I noticed that I wasn’t feeling an ounce of romantic (not only sexual) desire. That remained so for the rest of the day, even after she left. I noticed myself texting her in a way that wasn’t as enthusiastically romantic as I always do. \n\nNow it’s Tuesday, and I still feel the same way since Saturday. I still find her pretty, but I haven’t felt romantic or sexual desire for her since then. I wonder, is it that I somehow randomly suddenly lost my attraction for her, despite having found her incredibly hot and attractive just a couple of days ago—or perhaps this could be directly tied to my ADHD. I have no idea whether my romantic/sexual feelings for her might come back in a couple of days, or not. \n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD and OCD years ago, and this whole situation is really stressing me out. We’ve bonded so much throughout the past months, and I don’t know why I’m feeling this way… have you gone through anything similar?",

I am now 30 but struggle with some things, I don’t know if ADHD meds would help or not. \n\nMy question is do you have to have some sort of official diagnosis to receive ADHD medications and if so since I had Strattera as a child does that mean that I was at some point diagnosed? Also, how much do you pay monthly for your ADHD medications with insurance in the US. \n\nSorry if this type of post isn’t allowed.",

        "text": "We're still at an early stage of dating. I actually didn't know he has ADHD until one day I saw his prescription pill bottle at his house( Amphetamine Salt er 15 mg). I didn't know it was Adderall until I looked it up. I haven't asked him about it because I don't know if he wants to talk about it. My first question is do doctors prescribe Adderall for other health issues besides ADHD? The reason why I am asking is that he doesn't seem like he has ADHD.\n\nWhen I'm with him, he's attentive and caring. And after I researched a little bit about ADHD, it doesn't seem like he has most of the symptoms. I only noticed a few small things that are not necessarily contributed to ADHD. \n\nHe has a hard time sleeping at night. He sometimes forgets some of the little things I mentioned before, but nothing major. I can see people without ADHD do the same thing. And he takes 2-3 days to reply to text messages unless the messages require immediate responses or are something he's interested in. I told them I didn’t like it, but he hasn't changed this behavior pattern( this’s the only major ADHD symptom I noticed). But when he replies, he puts effort into messages. \n\nAlso, sometimes he gets a little upset over some little things I did, but he doesn't take it on me. He just doesn't talk nicely as he normally does for a short period. I didn't know that's how he acts when he's mad at me until later I noticed the pattern. He's also kind of quiet when he's with me. But during the first few dates, he sometimes mumbled. He's also a high achiever and self-disciplined. He is very focused when he works and does a good job. \n\nI don't know much about ADHD. So I appreciate any comments! Is there anything I should be aware of or can do while I'm dating him? \n\nAlso, I think he didn't want to or feel comfortable disclosing that he has ADHD (if he has ADHD) when we first started dating, but as our relationship progressed, I think letting me see the pill bottle is his way to open up and let me know he has ADHD. This would be my guess because he had never left his pill bottle out like that or talked about he's taking the pill. So how can I approach this topic and have a discussion with him about ADHD?",

A few days ago I was up late doing an assignment that I neglected to do for a week or so drinking caffeine in place of a stimulant as I had done before I had started medication then went to sleep. When I woke up it was no different sat and did nothing for half an hour forgetting about everything I should have done then took my pill and that day was almost intentional to the one a few weeks ago and after a small amount of math there would have been about 45mg of caffeine in my system left when I woke up. I tried repeating it, taking about 40 mg half an hour before I take my pill and for the past few days at least it has been fully repeatable. \n\nHas anyone else had this same experience or it it just some weird interaction between the two for me ?",

        "text": "Tl;dr at the bottom\n\nI’m sorry if this isn’t the place for this or if it is too long but I do genuinely want help/advice. I’m not sure how much background is necessary. We’ve been together for 3 years and live together. \n\nIn 2021 while staying with his parents, his mom mentioned to me that he was diagnosed with ADHD as a very young kid and she told him back then (around 15+ years ago). I didn’t know and was fairly sure my partner didn’t know either so I asked her to mention it to him. She kept postponing it so I asked him myself, he did not know and seemed upset to find out. I think he viewed it as being something wrong with him. He did eventually talk to his mom about it very briefly, she did not think it was a big deal. \n\nSince then I have only mentioned it once or twice because each time he seems so uncomfortable. My friend who I have known longer has ADHD and has learned how to be extremely productive and we have talked about it a few different times. \n\nAnyway I started to notice little things with my partner that impacted him, like procrastination or motivation and anxiety/depression struggles. I wanted to help so I decided to just kindly mention (treading lightly) that he may benefit from reading more about ADHD. I think he had said he’d done a bit but it was hard on him and he wasn’t really ready to talk about it. That was probably last year. He had a period where he was getting worse but we didn’t think about it’s relation to ADHD, it was just the Covid world. Everyone’s mental health was declining.\n\nA lot has happened in our life and I have been having my own issues recently. Yesterday I got to catch up with my previously mentioned friend. I was describing my stress, and how my partner has responded. Out of the blue she says that what I am describing is something she struggles with because of ADHD and that it was probably the same for him. I can’t even describe my brain at that moment. I had forgotten about my own partner's ADHD. I told her that it hadn’t even crossed my mind in months. I felt terrible. She reminded me that i didn’t need to think about it all the time, but that it could help me to understand (not excuse) his actions better. She said ultimately it’s his job to acknowledge and work on those things as well. Which I do know is true. But this morning I thought I’d check this community to see if I could understand better. \n\nScrolling through the top of all time and I am honestly a little heartbroken. I have not been understanding at all. I have in fact done many of the things that a lot of you have vented about others doing which make you feel bad.\nHe has also opened up to me over the years about many of the things that were in the top posts, we just didn’t consider it could be from untreated ADHD. These posts helped me understand things in an entirely different way. I feel terrible to have not realized sooner.\n\nI want to be more understanding and supportive. I also do wish I could encourage him to confront it a little more, like maybe even reading some of the posts here because they really helped me. But I don’t want to push him, it doesn’t feel like my place.\nI spend a lot of time working on my mental health so it’s very normal to me and it makes me sad that he potentially views having ADHD as something wrong with him that he has to avoid, it also worries me when people ignore their mental health because in my experience it only gets worse.\nI also know that I have not been helpful in the last few months and have probably only made things worse. He was really trying his best to support me in his own ways but I couldn’t see it at the time. I can sadly say I have probably made him feel that nothing he does is quite good enough. I’m so upset with myself. \nHe’s started to build a routine for himself and honestly he seems to be managing well, better than before. There are still things I notice though. \nI don’t want to bring anything up to him if it will set him back at all. I also feel really bad though. In my lowest times I just wanted him to “listen to me and support me”. If he got distracted, I took it personally, as if he didn’t care. When he showed me that he cared in other ways I couldn’t recognize it. I could describe more but this is already pretty long. We both have a lot to work on, but we really love each other. I feel like I should acknowledge and apologize for my wrongdoings at least in some way but I’m not sure how. Any advice or input would be appreciated!!\n\nAlso for whatever it’s worth, I’m sorry to everyone here who has been put down by someone else’s ignorance/stupidity/selfishness. You deserved better. \n\nTl;dr Got caught up in my own BS, literally forgot my partner has (untreated) ADHD. Came to this community to learn more, found out I’ve been a terrible partner and not supportive or understanding at all. Seeking advice and input to be better.",
