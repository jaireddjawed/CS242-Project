I am German, so I looked at both the German and the English list of best selling music artists of all time, but they are different. For example, the lists of the artists with more than 250 million sales are as follows:  \nEnglish:\n\n1. The Beatles 2. Elvis Presley 3. Michael Jackson 4. Elton John 5. Queen 6. Madonna 7. Led Zeppelin 8. Rihanna 9. Pink Floyd  \n([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_best-selling\\_music\\_artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_music_artists))  \n\n\nGerman\n\n1. The Beatles 2. Michael Jackson 3. Elvis Presley 4. Madonna 5. Elton John 6. Eric Clapton 7. Rihanna 8. Led Zeppelin 9. Pink Floyd  \n([https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste\\_von\\_Interpreten\\_mit\\_den\\_meisten\\_verkauften\\_Tontr%C3%A4gern\\_weltweit](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_von_Interpreten_mit_den_meisten_verkauften_Tontr%C3%A4gern_weltweit))  \n\n\nSo the German one doesn't even list Queen under the artists with more than 250 million sales. So which one is correct or are they both wrong? I can't find a source that groups the worldwide sales, only US sales which are portrayed to be world wide sales.",
