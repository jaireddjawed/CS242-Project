Little does she know I‚Äôm dealing with depression but I don‚Äôt think I need to explain that to her. I even accidentally saw her group chat with her cousins and she mentioned to them how I‚Äôm so boring and she hates hanging out with me. She thinks this way of me because I‚Äôm not out partying every weekend or doing excessive drugs like her and her family. My brothers life has even turned into a mess with constant drinking  and partying but I‚Äôm the one whose worthless at 26. So what if I don‚Äôt like to party or go clubbing why does it matter? I genuinely don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm missing out on anything nor do I feel the need to prove I have friends or a life.",

As she responded, I was mentally giving myself a pat on the back for coming up with an important question and being a mature adult taking charge of my health, blah blah blah. Then she showed me to the exit, I wished her a good day, and I walked to my car happy with the appointment. I then realized that when I was congratulated myself for asking a basic question, I had zoned her out and did not hear when or if she wanted a follow up with me, and now I‚Äôm too embarrassed to reach out to her and ask again. I know I have to eventually. Smdh",

So I made it my goal to make at least a couple of friends I can hang out and talk regularly. But it's been almost 5 months and no progress. But then I realized that I may be the problem as I looked around my other classmates friend groups loomed kinda toxic. They would get into alot of arguments and I wondered if they even liked each other. For example I heard how they someone stole something from someone as a joke gave to his friend didn't give it back till the weekend. Then he said he told him to stfu and that he was gonna beat his ass or somethinglile that i wanst reallypayingattention. and this is I think common from what I have observed. This made me rethink who I consider my friends and to even pursue making friends Isolating me even more. I think I'm over thinking stuff and have a hard time accepting people's flaws it's also hard for me to form an emotional connection with someone. I have feel like I have been in stuck in my comfort for too long and it's making me feel lonely and miserable",

Since last summer all they‚Äôve ever wanted to do was watch TikTok‚Äôs or movies, no more fun‚Ä¶ \n\nYou see I‚Äôm very active, enjoy doing stuff with friends even meeting new people and I‚Äôve been able to handle the sitting around on our phones at ‚Äòthe bois house‚Äô or even watch a show or movie. \n\nBut now I‚Äôve just jumped into a dive of depression. Will only see them about a couple times a week and sometimes just don‚Äôt see them for a week or so. I feel like I‚Äôve gotten antisocial with them. I don‚Äôt even enjoy being around them anymore. I‚Äôve talked to some of them about this but nothing happens.\n\nBut as an introvert, how do I reach out to other people I‚Äôd like to be around? I get jammed up and run away it seems. I‚Äôm a 20 year old Male, my friends are all 18-19. \n\nAlso I‚Äôm not into the whole club or bars, even though it‚Äôs a good place to meet others. I have my reason why I won‚Äôt go to them.\n\nIt seems so hard to meet other people, I feel like I‚Äôm getting to the age where I‚Äôm to old to do certain things like hang out in a parking lot or whatever.\n\nAny advise helps.

If I need to partner with someone for an activity, I can match their personality for the most part‚Äì joke around with them if they‚Äôre in a good mood, stay quiet but on task if they‚Äôre also the quiet type. I‚Äôve made a few new friends this year through doing this, which is a huge achievement to me, but the issue isn‚Äôt those guys, it‚Äôs the friends I‚Äòve *previously* made.\n\nI‚Äôll only refer to one specific friend for convenience; let‚Äôs call him Jason.\n\nJason and I have known each other for about a year and a half. Last year, we were sort of friends, but my social anxiety was at its peak; I could barely exchange words with him whatsoever.\n\nThis year, it‚Äôs gotten a lot better. We got each others numbers and have texted a little bit, and in person, we often will sit together and have pretty average conversations. That‚Äôs the pattern: We sit down, talk about one fixed conversation subject (ex. English class, driving, whatever) and then the convo ends when one of us leaves. Nothing emotional ever comes up, our relationship never gets any deeper.\n\nI‚Äôm not saying this is a huge problem by any means, but it‚Äôs been starting to frustrate me recently. With my new friends, I feel comfortable enough to use my considerably more social and joking personality around them, but with Jason, since he‚Äôs known me since *before* that version of me, I can‚Äôt exactly suddenly switch to that version. I guess I want to know, how exactly do I slide into being the person I really am around him? I‚Äôve tried, but all my jokes feel forced and I feel like I constantly have to be putting up an act, whereas it comes naturally for my other friends.",

I'm not awkward anymore and usually have enough to say and do my best in balancing who the attention goes to (since i had a previous habit of running my mouth).\n\n I moved to a new school and I've been here for 3 months  now, and i still have absolutely no friends. Whenever i want to make friends I'm usually always the one who has to approach people because they'll stare A LOT but will NEVER talk first. But even when i do talk first, it feels like they think I'm a bit weird. No matter how open i am, people never really return the same enthusiasm (except this one girl i met like 2 days ago but unfortunately our teacher made a seating plan and i cant sit with her anymore :/). I feel like i come off as mentally challenged whenever that happens, its like everyone else is uncomfortable with me.  In group projects, people always make me the leader because I'm the one who talks the most (i still listen to anyone who has ideas and give them the spotlight when they do, but a lot of the time they don't really offer much) I always try to make everyone in the group feel included, but they don't seem to be very enthusiastic about being around me. \n\nBack in my old school, people would approach me sometimes and we'd hit it off pretty easily. I've been in large friend groups before and people generally seemed to like me. I've been told that people at this new school are pretty shy and usually stick to the people they know, however, I feel like that i might be contributing to the problem somehow. \n\nI am a bit insecure in this field specifically, but i wouldn't say that I'm just imagining things. Maybe they really are just shy, or maybe I really am coming off a bit too strong. \n\nAre there any judgements you guys can make based off of my post? What are some things i may be doing wrong?",

Obviously, we try to help each   other out when someone has an emergency or an important appointment etc   and switch shifts when necessary.\n\nOf   course, we have black sheep that are conveniently sick on not so   favorable shifts or always want help yet never offer some. Except there   is something in for them. So one day Bob asks me by mail whether I can   switch shifts with him so he can go to an appointment. Due to   appointments on my end I could not agree and apologized that I could not   help.\n\nSoon after he asks for   another \"switch\" by e-mail. He asked me whether he could have my rest   day and if I could do his shift at the end of the month. Reason being   that he will transfer temporary and wants some day off before beginning a   new journey.\n\nSo, he simply wants  a  day off without using any of his vacation. Probably, he won't return   either. Basically, I was offered a switch without anything in return.   Which again, would be fine if had a valid reason like an important   appointment. So,what did I answer ?\n\nI   answered him back via Mail: \"The choice between a rest day and working   is a hard one, but with my aching heart I have to choose rest day. I   would have helped you out with the problem before but like I said I have   no time. Maybe someone else can help you out.\"\n\nOf   course, like in all firms we also gossip and make fun of each other.   Most of the time I'm on the receiving end. But we are civil - at least   that's how I see it. And of course I would also complain about this   horrendous offer in a very humorous way. How I would always get offers   like this or \"Apparently, I am a yes-sayer and hence people try this on   me\".\n\nFew weeks later after my   mail, Bobs asks me how I could have no respect for him in my answer and   also talking behind his back like that. To be honest, I was quite   surprised when he randomly refereed to that incident after such a long   time\n\nWell, I told him that I don't   remember talking behind his back. After all, I was quite clear in my   mail towards him that it was a stupid offer to begin with....and what I   told my colleagues was just that: I got a really stupid offer. In no   way, did I spread false rumors or insult him.  I made fun of his   audacity and he was fully in the know.\n\nI   told him: \"While I was quite ironic I did not insult you. If I had   offered you the same switch, I would have excepted the same kind of   answer. And some level of gossip is in each of us. After all it's human   nature\"\n\nI continued that that this is not something to start a fight for.\n\nHe   would't stand here and be disrespected. I tried to be calm: \"I see  that  you didn't like my choice of words. You, me and others are taking  part  in gossip and say things that can be taken in a wrong way.\" He  demanded  examples where he was disrespectful to me. I simply said that  not  everything we say will be well received. I was quite baffled and  after a  whole 10 Min of listening how his ego was hurt I told him to  end this  discussion.\n\nAnyways, was I too direct ?",

They switched their career path, having entered the design world after college. Their portfolio has more than a few thoughtful projects. \n\nI graduated with a design degree and had the opportunity to work with campaigns and school programs. I‚Äôve actually built a few websites, too. \n\nWorking together has been interesting. Because the agency receives projects unpredictably throughout the year, we rarely work on separate projects. We all work from home, so our conversations happen via a messenger app. \n\nWe clearly have different workflows. Whenever we take on a project brief, I prefer to have a moment to digest my thoughts. They are quick to start outlining the design file. I spend more time coming up with one good idea; they spend their time coming up with different options.  \n\nMost days that we‚Äôre working together, I‚Äôm asked ‚Äúhow‚Äôs your day‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat do you think about this font/color/shape‚Äù or ‚ÄúI like what you did‚Äù. Perfectly normal questions, I know, but they come often. They‚Äôre affecting me more than I‚Äôd like. I‚Äôve never been one for small talk. I prefer questions that are concise or compact, without the extra lines.\n\nThese questions have become enough to make me anxious when they come. I‚Äôve made it a habit to respond after a while, so I can be calm. I have my coworker ‚Äúmuted‚Äù currently. \n\nSometimes I think they ask too much clarifying questions; today, it was about constraints for an commerce question. I would‚Äôve ask it in more straight forward way. Last week, they asked about the vibe a client wanted, which I thought was up to interpretation based on the brief.\n\nI consider myself a lone-wolf, avoiding questions where I can. \n\nWe‚Äôve been working on a long term website project, that they have been eager to check in with the boss. I honestly think they care about this one project the most out of anyone. I think we‚Äôve also had one to many video meetings, whether to check in over our boss‚Äôs comments or to prepare for a presentation. I agree to these meetings so that I can be helpful, but I think these could‚Äôve been emails. \n\nThey respond almost immediately to any design task that comes up. Every brief we receive to our inboxes, they are quick to respond with a long thank you. I didn‚Äôt know this was even welcomed. \n\nI‚Äôve also discovered many pet peeves designing with my coworker: shapes set to decimals, large body font, white + black text on a yellow background, and more. \n\nOf course, these don‚Äôt make my coworker a bad person. I find myself unable to match their friendly energy. If any of this sounds like a coworker you‚Äôve had, or if I can elaborate somewhere, let me know.",

It's frustrating because when I was younger I was bad at initiating plans because of social anxiety (and not having a car, but I have one now), but now I've grown out of my shell a bit and I'm constantly feeling this rejection every time I suggest something. I can't imagine my ideas suck that bad, since I'm bringing up things that I could see them being somewhat interested in doing. I don't know what the solution is, really.",

        "text": "So feeling lonely can have negative effects on physical and mental health. Research has shown that chronic loneliness can increase the risk of various health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline. Loneliness can also weaken the immune system, making a person more susceptible to illness, along with other things it can lead to poor sleep, increased stress, and unhealthy behaviors, such as substance abuse and overeating. \n\n\nI‚Äôve experienced some of these things, usually I can sustain the isolation for awhile, spending 4-5 months without talking to anyone, until the loneliness starts to creep in and I fall into another rut. But the problem is that, there‚Äôs something missing in my connection with others. I don‚Äôt feel satisfied hanging out, or having an intimate relationship with others, or talking to random strangers. I have friends but they don‚Äôt feel like anything to me. I know this is damaging to my mental health somehow. Maybe its due to having specialized in an niche field of work, with ‚Äúniche‚Äù interests and goals, that I can‚Äôt experience a shared bond between others. I feel that everyone in our society is so invested in their own obscure interests and worried about whatever is happening in their own lives. And maybe not feeling like many people are truly trustworthy individuals. \n\nThe next concern is, I don‚Äôt want to feel alone, but I also don‚Äôt want to invest a ton of time outside of work and don‚Äôt want it to squander my achievements by having to do so, but also, it simultaneously seems inconsiderate to view others this way. How do you think is the best way to go about this?  \n\nAnyone the same? What *exactly* is loneliness and how is it measured? What is it that ‚Äúregisters‚Äù in the body when we feel connection to others and how is it triggered? What amount of socializing do you think is required? What type of activities do you usually do? What level of intimacy? What are the appropriate areas to focus on to complete a healthy social life?",
