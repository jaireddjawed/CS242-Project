Any ideas?",

In December, and again this week, I was able to have my prescription filled, in full, the same day they received it.  And my doctor is able to write me a 90 day prescription, so I got 90 of each.\n\n8 years ago, I switched to a small, independent pharmacy at the advice of my doctor, and have never regretted it.  The only downside is their limited hours, but they're so much easier to deal with.\n\nHere are the benefits:\n\n * The employees have been the same for the same 8 years, so they all recognize me.\n * I've never been treated as if I am a drug addict\n * If they don't have the full quantity, they will give me a partial fill and let me pick up the rest later\n * I don't even remember the last time they've asked for my ID.\n\nAnd according to my psychiatrist, the smaller pharmacies will make sure that they have medications when their regular customers need them (which is why they're not as impacted by the Adderall shortages).\n\n**TL/DR:  Switch to a small independent pharmacy and your problems go away.**",

Three days ago my dosage was increased to 30mg and after 7 days my doctor told me to move up to 40mg if it’s going ok.\n\nSince starting my medication 3 days ago, I’ve been feeling progressively depressed and sad. On the first day I was okay, but today and yesterday have been a mess. No motivation, just total apathy, which gets worse as the day goes on. Yesterday night I was experiencing a lot of back pain (I have back problems) and laid in bed so I’d feel better but I progressively became depressed and couldn’t leave the bed. I was hungry but no food looked appealing, I hated the idea of eating anything. It got worse as the night went on. \n\nThis morning I was okay but decided to go on a 3-4hr walk and just before leaving I started to become depressed and it got really bad on the walk. I was having massive waves of crazy sadness and then being okay over and over. I got back not long ago and feel okay but I know the wave will come back again.\n\nI should note that there have been recent really sad events that have happened recently (my gf’s mom being abusive) but i don’t think it would affect me like this so I’m sure it’s the meds. And I’ve also tried concerta which made me insanely panicky and anxious and I will not try that again, ever.\n\nShould I stick it out and see what 40mg is like? Will an increased dosage help? Or should I change meds and what should I change them to? I’m worried that no meds will help me, because my ADHD has really affected me for a long time and I want something to help.",

I've noticed my sleep gets very interrupted and I wake up in what I think is a panic when taking Vyvanse. \n\nEx: I take my Vyvanse everyday between 830-9. Last night I went out for Japanese and had two warm Sakes around 730. Went to bed at 1030 and woke up at 130am with my chest pounding and what almost felt like the tingles, likewhen your arm is asleep, in my chest. It went away and eventually I calmed down and fell back asleep, but woke again with another anxiety attack. No tingles though. \n\nI will say I have been living with health anxiety for a while now. So I always have some sort of underlying anxiety, whether I'm feeling heart palpitations or nervous my foot is getting swollen...\n \nMaybe I'm crazy, but yeah curious if having a few drinks the night of taking a Vyvanse has ever given anyone side effects. \n\nAlso, I'm a male and 30. I was on 20mg for a month, and it's been bumped to 30mg. I've been on 30 for about a week and a half.\n\nThanks",

We used to talk for hours at a time almost every day while playing video games, but that time has passed. Initially, I thought I had offended her and she was upset with me, but now I realize it was her ADHD acting up. She did mention that she was initially hyper-focused with me and the video games we were playing, but that this has faded. I had no experience dealing with someone with ADHD, so I simply blamed myself, claiming I did something. She started to barely talk and i continued to believe i as the one that did something. The main issue is that this is my first ever proper relation for me and as a rookie, I did make a couple of mistakes on this relation. Initially i was saying practically saying everything to her as a way to manage my emotions and getting too obsessive and now's the time i realize that was just unhealthy for both of us as i was holding a belief that talking to your partner will solve your problem and now Im currently am undergoing therapy and i feel much much better. \n\nI also had this conversation with my therapist yesterday, who apparently has ADHD as well! He mentioned how easy it is for him to miss texts, get sucked into things like movies, and forget to contact people for a long duration, and that's when I realized there's nothing wrong with this, and every time I felt insecure about whether she still loves me or cares about me now makes sense! And now that I know it's simply her symptom of ADHD, I'm willing to accept it with ease but I feel like I still have a lot to learn regarding this.\n\nI'm currently researching ADHD and wanted to get some real-life advice from the community so I can make her feel better.  If you have anything that you believe could help me treat her better please let me know.\n\nMany thanks:)",

So I don’t have hyperactivity, instead I’m low energy and very low focus. I have tried non stimulant medication in the past, and it just didn’t work for me. I am drinking a ton of coffee (coldbrew) as I’ve found that works the best for me. I know some energy drinks have higher caffeine, but for some reason coffee works best.\nAs much as coffee helps, it no where amounts to the help my adderall gives me.\nI’ve ended up taking LOA from work because I absolutely cannot do my job safely with out meds. It’s dropped me into a huge depression because I can’t even stay home and enjoy activities that I once did because I don’t have the focus, nor energy.\nI’m just wondering if any of you have any suggestions for different forms of caffeine, or supplements that really help you with focus. Despite working with my doctor I don’t see an end in the near future, and I’d love to at least somewhat enjoy my time home, or maybe even return to work (I love my job, and its heartbreaking going on leave).

The script is for 20mg 2x a day. It’s been a couple of weeks now and while I seem to have a better appetite than with Adderall my emotional outbursts are almost back to unmedicated levels, the littlest things would set me off. As an example before I decided to really pursue a diagnosis, I had come home from a long trip with just my kids and the house was a mess which made me angry with my husband and then something I ordered from a photo service was delivered but the canvas was wrinkled and stained and I lost it. I was trying to close our bi fold closet door and it wasn’t shutting so I slammed the door a bunch of times so hard that I broke the door. On Adderall I would have been able to think it through before losing my shit, but not with Ritalin. I’m yelling again and today I did something shitty without thinking and now my brain is going in 800 different directions including unaliving myself thoughts. Which I don’t usually have even pre diagnosis.\n\nI have communicated with my doctor about this and I hope we can find a different solution(obviously won’t hear back soon because it’s the weekend).

I know he needs support, but I feel like all the negative things he reads is sticking out to him more and it is impacting our relationship.

After speaking to my NP she decided to put me on Wellbutrin. I understand this is an off-label prescription and that’s it’s primarily an antidepressant. I spoke to her and she knows I have no symptoms of Depression so I’m assuming she’s trying to avoid stimulants as a first line treatment. I would have much rather started with them considering their success rate, but I am open minded to trying other options. With all that said, I wanted to know how other people’s experiences were on this medication. Also curious if anyone uses it alone for treatment of ADHD symptoms and if anyone has any comparisons to Strattera.",

Right now I'm just happy to have a job, to be able to afford rent, food and stuff, so pls dont tell me to quit my job for therapy, cause my job also gives me stability and security which I really need for my mental wellbeing.*\n\n\\*\\*I'm 28 and I struggle\\*\\*. I struggle a lot, especially with focus, learning over long periods, managing appointments, staying persistent with finances, diet, sports, friendships, hobbys and so on. I'm interested in everything as long as I dont have to go too much into detail cause that would require constant focus and a plan which I usually dont have. I procrastinate everything. I run to the bus nearly every day cause I misscalculate time constantly. I'm perfectionistic. I check everything regarding lights, stove etc four to five times before leaving the house. \\*\\*All in all you could say: I dont really trust myself and am under constant stress due to something I cant comprehent.\\*\\*\n\n\\*Example:\\* Today I had one single appointment in the afternoon with a friend of mine and a group which I didnt know well. All I had to do was sitting there, listen to a talk and ask questions if I wanted to. I had no tasks except from showing up on time and that was enough to paralyze me the entire day. \n\nSince I was a kid I struggled with believing in myself. I wasnt the strongest , the smartest, the prettiest but I also never found a smart, creative or brave way to overcome this. Instead of working out I sit around, think and wait and distract myself. I used movies, prn, series, books, games and all kinds of narritives to escape my reality. I never really learned how to be consistent, how to properly learn or how to be disciplined. Instead of learning I clean my room or watch netflix. Instead of putting money aside I buy stuff cause I feel stressed about my sitution. Instead of sticking to a hobby I peak into much different sports, activities and else, but never just stay with one. \n\nRight now I started a new career a year ago cause I wasted my years before that studying at a university without much success. I avoided my duties and life in general. Now I have this one last opportunity and I dont want to fk this up. Do you have wisdom to share with me on how to handle the points I made better?",

I left a comfortable corporate job to create technology that could help people like me achieve better outcomes in life, two years have passed since then. I've raised several hundred thousand dollars, built a medical team and done clinical research-- all things I never thought I could achieve as someone with ADHD so quickly... but my company is out of money and without a technical lead who specializes in full-stack mobile app development, we can't bring the product I've dreamed of to market.\n\nIt leaves me feeling very sad and like so many things I start in life, unfinished.\n\nWith the recent adderall shortage I realize many of you are hurting as well and your daily projects and daily activities are going unfinished. In an attempt to be helpfulI wanted to give back to this community that has inspired me so much. My co-founder and I have created a free tool called \"Cards Against ADHD,\" which includes ADHD tips, strategies, and executive function training techniques. I hope they can be helpful to you.\n\nThere’s a free and paid tier but we will be giving the paid tier away this weekend for free for everyone who is a part of this online community. Using the code “Reddit” you will get 100% off your premium subscription. All I ask is that you drop a comment with some feedback on how we might make this content better. Currently I’m planning on incorporating a Unity based battle system against personified ADHD symptoms to make the content more interactive and worth memorizing.\n\nRedirect to the discounted Cards Against ADHD here: www.theadhdcompany.org\n\nThough I rarely post, as someone with ADHD, I've always found a lot of inspiration and comfort in this community. I wanted to thank you all for being a part of my journey. If anyone has any advice or words of encouragement, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nFunny enough, The first \"ADHD Experiment\" my company built came from a question my co-founder asked this very reddit community two years ago, \"Does sound REALLY help you focus?\". Since then I have learned so much about my personal ADHD, business, product design and experienced an even wider range of emotions than I thought possible, even with ADHD.\n\nThank you for listening to my ramblings.\n\n❤️",

I found something I loved at 26 (working outside), but worked through various seasonal positions and then pursued an MSc to qualify in my field. \n\nI graduated last year. I did really well academically, and overall had a fantastic time during the MSc. I did so well I got a well paying job at the end of it and was feeling pretty good about myself autumn last year.\n\n5 months into the job and I hate it. It is office based, admin heavy, detail oriented, bureaucratic, numerous meaningless tasks, and there is no autonomy in decision making. None of these things work with my ADHD. The whole reason I got into this line of work was so I could be outside and be away from this kind of work. \n\nI moved to the other end of the country for this position, to a really rural area, and feel particularly bored living here. The monotony of the 9-5, including the work during those hours, alongside the monotony of my life, is making me depressed.\n\nI really want to leave but I don't know where to go from here. The MSc makes me overqualified for a lot of work in the field I'd really enjoy. All the jobs in my field at the level I'm working at involve a significant amount of office work. \n\nI'm seriously considering returning to academia to pursue a PHD with a view to lecture and research because:\n\n- I do not feel that I 'fit in' in the typical professional world, and really do not want to even conform to it\n\n- I struggle with being actively line managed, and need far greater autonomy in my work (which you get with research and lecturing)\n\n- I am really ambitious but my deficiencies are so evident in the typical professional world\n\n- I get hyperfocus with research and long length projects, if I have the opportunity to work alone\n\n- I feel really energised when working with people and generally enjoy academic communities\n\nHave you ever found a position that works for you and if so how many job changes until you found the one?\n\nI'm now on job number 12 at 30 years old.\n\nAlso anyone here with ADHD pursued a PHD? How did you find it?\n\nTLDR: I am an ambitious person but I cannot cope with an office job, how long does it take to find a job that works for you?",

All will seem to be fine, but it’s almost as if my tongue is too big for my mouth and I get these teeth imprints on the sides of my tongue that drive me crazy and I bite off, which then leads to me treating the inside of my mouth like an all you can eat buffet. \n\nThen as it heals it feels strange in my mouth so I can’t stop thinking about it and start biting it all again. It’s almost like parts of my mouth don’t feel smooth or feel weird on my tongue so they must be removed, which just leads to more bumps and grooves that feel out of place that I bite off, and it’s a cycle… I don’t know if any of this makes any sense or if it’s an ADHD thing, but I saw another post about skin picking and thought this was comparable? \n\nAnyways, just wondering if anyone else can relate and/or has any tips on how to stop.",

I’m not ready to date anyone right now, but after meeting him, I realize that I will be again, eventually. \n\nHere’s the thing: I don’t know how to bring up the fact that I (most likely, I’m waiting on a diagnosis) have ADHD.\n\nIn addition to this, I live a very ‘non-traditional’ lifestyle as an artist. There are notes all over my desk, I’m constantly darting around my house (as I tend to do), am kind of forgetful at times, and sort of awkward (this part is just me, not ADHD-related), and I just have no idea how to even begin to bring this topic up to a potential future partner. I feel like I function kind of ‘weird,’ if that makes sense.\n\nIn the past, my (probably) ADHD seemed to be glossed over, but it actually makes my life absolute chaos at times, and it’s actually very stressful. I feel like it hasn’t been taken very seriously when I tell someone that I think that I have it. I’ve even been told by my ex in the past that it’s ‘not real.’ (My ex was corporate, and was constantly enraged with me because of me ‘not being like him.’)\n\nI’m wondering if anyone has some kind words or advice or success stories that you could share with me, as I really would like to figure out a way to explain this before I get into a relationship again, thank you.",

Also the more I reasearched about ADD the more I saw how my siblings and my dad also exhibit many of the symptoms. My mother is the only one who actually seems normal, although she might be a little bit narcissistic, anxious and probably depressed, which is kinda understandable when all the weight has been put on her shoulders for so long. I want to help her but I just can't, my mind wants to be tidy and organised but its like every cell in my body doesn't.

        "text": "Hey all! I was somewhat recently diagnosed with ADHD and started the oh-so fun process of finding the right medication for me. My doctor started me on Adderall XR about four months ago, I’ve slowly gone through the titration process, going from 10 mg to 15 mg and now I’m at 25 mg. \n\nInitially Adderall was so therapeutic and helped my symptoms so much, I saw a lot of improvement. I had side effects, but I was able to cast them aside, especially because I understood I was going through the unsavory titration process and not everything was going to be perfect right away. But now that I’ve been on Adderall for going on four months now, I’m overall unhappy with it. \n\nThe first 2 - 4 hours after taking it are great. No complaints. But after that, the side effects are in full effect. It makes my anxiety so much worse, specifically negatively affecting my checking OCD. Meaning I have to do my checking rituals far more and for far longer before I’m able to stop ruminating on them. Headaches are persistent. Jaw clenching is destroying my teeth. And I find myself crashing so intensely on it. I’ve tried what feels like everything. I take it with a meal, plenty of sleep, I drink plenty of water and my job forces me to be pretty active.\n\nIm just overall done dealing with the side effects, there’s also too much variation in generics. I’ve taken Adderall that has not affected my anxiety at all before, but I can’t get that brand again due to the shortage. I’m interested in trying Vyvanse as a lot of people seem to have better experiences with it. Do you guys have any tips for asking my doctor about switching over? I see her on Tuesday for a routine medication management appointment, so any advice would be appreciated, thank you!",

        "text": "I started taking vyvanse last year and on the whole the results have been remarkable. I started at 10mg and have been slowly titrating upwards.\n\nI was finding 30mg too little and 40mg too much (some days would be ok, others I’d be an anxiety-ridden mess), so I finally convinced my GP to give me 30+10 so I can scale up and down as needed.\n\nSince I started that, I’ve never once felt that 30+10 was too much. To the point that I’ve been wondering if trying 50 would be worth it.\n\nI’m running low on my split dose so today I took a 40mg that I had left over. It feels very much like it’s way too much. I haven’t felt like this since I switched to 30s and 10s.\n\nWhat the hell is going on here? I guess it could be a coincidence. Did my GP give me placebo 10s? Did the pharmacy give me empty capsules by accident?\n\nOr, maybe is there some difference in how doses in two capsules are metabolized versus the same dose in 1?\n\nCurious to see if this is just me or if anyone else has anecdotal evidence of this.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "This is my second day on Vyvanse. I got diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed it on the same day, so I’ve never taken another medication for it. I also have GAD but I’m unmedicated for that. \n\nIt seems like everything is too much. I went from absolutely no ability to focus, to too much of one. I’m getting constantly over stimulated. If more than one person is talking at once, I can hear and understand them both, and it drives my brain into overdrive and makes me start freaking out. \n\nI love everything else it does for me. I took notes in class for the first time in my life, I paid attention and understood what I was being taught. I did my homework without waiting until the last minute. I even cleaned my room without having burnout. \n\nBut the social aspects is too much. I feel like I can’t be in a room with more than one person without exploding. Children are the worse, which is very bad, because my major directly involves working with children. And I volunteer a lot with children. I love kids, too, I used to love teaching them and their loudness didn’t bother me.\n\nIs this just because I’m getting used to the meds? Does this happen to anyone else? I’m so disheartened because I love how motivated it’s made me but I’m not sure if I can live overstimulated my whole life.",
