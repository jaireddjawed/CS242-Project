        "text": "I have a fabulous little friend circle. There’s six couples in total and we all had children within the same close time frame. We have been friends for over ten years and we all ended up moving to the same village and now our kids are all at the same school. We see each other on the school run (respective of days, we all have different jobs, schedules etc). \n\nI work from home and so I do the school run every day, twice a day. It started as a mild annoyance. I usually arrive early for pick up. Therefore I get a close spot. I park in the first space, leaving plenty of room for prams, the millions of children crossing the road to be safe when I leave and just courteous to people turning in on a blind road to have space to pull over properly to check for oncoming cars (welcome to England where a two lane road is a one lane road because parking).\n\nI would walk down and wait for our son to be released and walk him back to the car. And every bloody day this tiny fiat would park directly behind me, blocking me in and causing a genuine hazard for the kids. The same car/parent will reverse out without looking nearly hitting people (this is not me being dramatic, I’ve witnessed it and had to basically throw my pram out the way to avoid it). \n\nThe driver is someone older. Likely a grandparent that either DGAF or has sight problems. I’m not THAT mum but once I was near THAT mum and she went fruit loops on this person. Who just drove off oblivious. So, what do we do to stop it? \n\nWell pick up is fairly flexible… there’s a 10-20m grace. I am always early and in the same spot. And then fiat comes. And my friend has to pick up their child from nursery first and so is usually one of the lasts to park and collect. So we park them in. \n\nImagine a corner. You can park either side of the corner but slightly right of the corner is the pedestrian lowered pavement for ease of prams bikes etc. To the right is a bollard preventing parking and then parking and a safe, dead end street. To the left is the moving traffic. I park on the short L, first space. Then the fiat parks half up the curb blocking the pedestrian space. \n\nSo my friend will come and basically park exactly next to them on the same angle. It doesn’t block traffic or pedestrians any more than they were but fiat but can no longer exit. Reverse you get bollard, forward is my car and my mates car leaves no space for even trying to turn. \n\nAnd you know what, I like chatting to my friend after a long day. We started to end up being the last people to leave. Took three days and fiat never said anything to either of us and now parks less like a fucking wanker and is no longer a liability to the families. However… I have seen them parked in by others in other spaces, I can’t claim credit but they’ve pissed enough people off that I feel it’s likely their revenge",

        "text": "Disclaimer, this was about 7 years ago, so the conversations are summarized and not 100% word for word.\n\nI used to work in a call center where everyone had little cubicles. You could chat with people on either side or behind you if things got slow, but anyone on the other side of the divider was sort of hard to see or chat with. (Only important because Karen was in this hard to see location from me)\n\nI have issues with overheating, medical stuff. I liked to sit right under the AC vent. Nobody fought me for this, because it was a little too cold for most people. Well, being a woman, this meant that sometimes I had some nipple pokey issues on some days. It's perfectly natural, and to most people, not noticeable because it was under my shirt + bra.\n\nKaren notices this and makes a report to HR. \n\nHR woman and my direct supervisor PARADE me through the cubicles and into their office, to question me about my nipples. Now, I could have thrown a fit about this to begin with, since we didn't actually have a dress code and it's none of their damn business. They asked me to prove I was wearing a bra, so I showed them the straps. They told me \"good enough\" basically, and to go back to my desk.\n\nI refused to go back. I said I needed to place a complaint about someone. They asked me who I was reporting. I said \"I don't know, but YOU do. I want to report whoever it was that's been staring at my breasts all day. Now that I know someone is staring, I feel like this is a hostile work environment.\" They acted like I was joking at first, until I said \"If you don't have a talk with them, I will go over your heads and report you for forcing me to reveal my bra to you.\"\n\nI got escorted back to my desk, and Karen was sitting there looking smug... until they escorted HER to the HR office instead. I don't know what happened to her in the office, and I didn't care- they did their part by having their talk with her. All I really wanted was to know WHO did it.\n\nSince it was a very slow day, all my co-workers started asking me what that was all about. Office gossip, you know. I told everyone exactly what had happened, and added that Karen must be fascinated with my breasts since she noticed (everyone else confirmed they didn't even notice). When she came back from HR, every person in the room knew what she had done, and was glaring at her. \n\nSnitches didn't get stitches, and didn't get fired either. But, they got treated like the Karen they were. Nobody would talk to her. People would be chatting, see her come try to join the conversation, and go silent and turn away from her. Some people did \"loud whispers\" and made comments like \"shhh, don't say anything, she will report you!\" She quit about 2 weeks later.",

        "text": "My bf (now ex) John and I had known each other since high school and we were an item for one summer, but we were both a bit immature and so we broke up. I went away for college and we didn’t really stay in touch. Years later we bumped into each other, we got on really well and feelings were still there. Eventually we went on a few dates before deciding to give it another go now we're older.\n\nNot long after we started dating, John said he needed to talk to me and seemed upset. He went to a birthday party at the weekend which I knew about but couldn't go as birthday girl wanted to keep the numbers small and strictly to people she knew. John said the birthday girl cornered him into her bedroom and tried to kiss him. He said he left the party straight away.\n\nI was annoyed but accepted what he told me over the fact that he came clean of his own accord which meant I saw no reason for him to lie to me, so we moved on from that. He was upset because he thought I would leave him having consulted a few of our mutual friends who were also at this party. They warned him against telling me as they were sure I'd break up with him.\n\nFast forward a few months. I went out with my bf and some of his work colleagues, some of whom I've known for a long time but also met some new ones. There was one girl who I'll call Janine who was a bit overbearing and a little too friendly. She kept quizzing me about mine and John's relationship and I figured she must just love a gossip. She was also very flirty with all the guys who nicknamed her \"smurfette\" which she revelled in as she was the only girl tagging along this group of guys, at least that's what they told her. They actually meant it as \"the village bike.\"\n\nThe next day, John asked me what I thought of Janine. I told him and he warned me against being friends with her, and that's when he told me she was the birthday girl. Ever since then I was a bit weary of her as she started following me on social media and always trying to be all friendly with me like I'm her bestie.\n\nShe eventually started dating another guy (Brian) from work but John told me Janine had been sliding into his DMs and was badmouthing me. When his birthday came up, she asked if I had put myself out for him and that if she was his gf, she would pleasure him all day long and let him do anything to her and use her any position he likes. (Disclaimer: I've toned down the language slightly as she was pretty graphic)\n\nThat pissed me right off. As my bf isn't all that bothered about his social media, I actually manage his accounts and therefore I have his password. Needless to say, I ended up reading all her messages and can see how John had tried to tell her to leave him alone. I told him I am taking screenshots. He asked what I was doing with them, I said I'm going to knock her off her perch. His only instruction was to just be mindful of Brian as he considers him to be a friend. However, I disagreed because Brian had previously told John to stop speaking to Janine because he thinks there's something going on between them and that John instigated it. I said unfortunately, Brian was collateral damage and he should be grateful that I opened up his eyes to the fact his gf isn’t at all as innocent as she claims.\n\nI ended up messaging Janine and calling her a dirty little whore and sent her the screenshots so she knows that I know everything. I also messaged Brian attaching the same screenshots and told him to sort his woman out. I then sent it around all of our mutual friends for them all to see. Janine never responded to me and unfriended me on social media. For a while, the mutual friends who saw her said she really hates me and thought I was such a bitch for fake being friends with her and that I was a backstabber. I never regarded her as a friend, she is a colleague of my bf who happens to be out with us because someone invited her. I was just being polite. I have my own friends, thank you. Brian removed himself off social media and did end up dumping her before moving abroad. Some of my friends thought I was being really harsh and vindictive to Janine and she didn't deserve to be humiliated in that way. I wish I cared.\n\nAs she was so graphic in what she wanted to do to my bf sexually, I got her email address and signed her up for porn site memberships, marketing lists of various sex toy shops, job sites requiring escorts and dating sites to absolutely spam her. Her email address without giving too much away said she was an \"angel.\" Angel my ass!",

        "text": "Not my story but recently happened to a friend of mine. Personal details omitted obviously.\n\nMy buddy Steve has worked at a small business for over 10 years. Most of his time there has been pretty alright but recently it has become a remarkably worse place to work. Steve is the most senior employee outside of management and by far the most productive. He's always training new hires, working extra hours, helping other departments, you name it.\n\nPretty often, Steve will come in for a couple hours on his day off to take care of backed up paperwork and general housekeeping of his department. This does wonders for keeping the department running smoothly, especially when they are busy. Management knows about this and approves.\n\nGoing into the holidays this year, they are absolutely slammed, as usual. Orders are backing up and it's all hands on deck, extra hours, full tilt. After another 60 hour work week, Steve has a couple days off. On his 2nd day off, he decides to go into work for a few hours. He knows his coworkers are likely too busy to be taking care of the side stuff, so he's being a team player and helping out.\n\nWhile he's finishing up and about to leave, Steve's manager comes up to him and they have the following conversation.\n\n \"Hey Steve, quit messing around, get back out there and do your job\"\n\nSteve replies \"Hey Manager, sorry, its my day off, I'm not scheduled to work this shift. I'm just helping out, leaving in like 5 min.\" \n\nManager replies \"The hell you are, get your ass out there.\"\n\nSteve says, \"Nope, not happening. I'm going home.\" \n\nThe next day, Steve is predictably brought into the office, dressed down, and written up for insubordination. But there's a few things about Steve that you should know, that his employers knew but either forgot or didn't care about.\n\n1. Steve has been getting fed up with his employer for a while now.\n\n2. Steve is quite financially stable, as he works in a high-demand industry, and his wife also has a fantastic well paying job. \n\n3. Steve is about to become a dad. In fact, he is very very close to becoming a dad, right after the holidays most likely. \n\nSo, Steve is in the manager's office, just finished getting talked down to, and handed his write up to sign. Steve signs his write up, and hands it back, along with an envelope with a short letter inside. \n\n\"What's this?\" manager asks.\n\n\"My two weeks notice.\" \n\nCue the backpeddling. Manager is apologetic, asks for Steve to at least finish the holiday rush, big boss comes in and offers a raise if he stays, the whole shebang. Steve turns it all down. \n\nNow Steve's former employer has to get through the holidays without their most reliable worker, which will take at least 2 or 3 new hires to cover.\n\nMeanwhile, Steve can enjoy the holidays without stress, help prepare for the arrival of their baby, and start looking for work again when they're good and ready.",

It was 1990 in the dark days before computers in an office were a thing.  We all had self generated cardexes (basically little cards in alphanumeric order in a flip to container) with client details on them.  I fell down some stairs and was off sick for a fortnight. I went into the office to find that all my contact cards were gone and the carded was full of blank cards!\n\nI asked where they were and was told the rest of the salesmen/women thought I was not coming back so had shared them around.  Ok, I’m back now, so please can you give me 10 contacts each to make up for it?  Nope, not happening.  I spoke to my boss, who said I needed to “work harder” and regenerate some more leads.\n\nI sat and fumed over this for about 2 hours, until the weekly 11am all hands compulsory meeting.  I pretended I was on a call and said I will be there in 2 minutes.  I went into the meeting and announced that I quit and I’ve redistributed the contact leads.  When they got back to the office, they found I had thrown all the cards from every cardex in the air! 😁",

        "text": "Years ago a boss is having a hell year. He's diagnosed with cancer a parent died and wife files for divorce, why you may ask? I'll spill that little morsel later. He was normally positive in all things, never quick to anger and generally a good person. This hell year really pushed him to breaking but he stilled worked through all this, never vented his pain and frustration on the people he managed and still had time and energy to listen to others problems. \n\nSo it's holiday season and our office is having their potluck, boss is asking all those with children what's their kiddos jacket size so he can swing by his church children coat drive and get proper fitting coats. And this woman(who I'll call viper from now on) with rage in her face comes storming into the potluck demanding she talk to boss now.\n\nOne of my coworkers who knows this woman walks up with a smile and greetings, that's answered with a \"move now.\" Coworker looks taken back and steps away. Boss meets viper and they leave to an empty office and close the door. I ask coworker who's viper and you guessed it. Bosses soon to be ex-wife, we've worked together for over 10 years and I have never seen viper before. So showing up like this is outside vipers normal behavior, she wasn't even at bosses 60th party that was hosted at their house. \n\nI'm not a social butterfly and was taking my plate to my desk to eat in peace and happened to be walking by the closed door office and overhear viper say \"When I married you it was for my worse not yours.\" She's a gem right!\n\nI go onto my desk to eat my plate when I hear someone walk into the larger office where I'm shoving my face like a chipmunk harvesting for winter.  I hear boss voice and stop mid chew hoping I'm not expected to answer then he says more after a short pause. Now I'm stuck, he's in the hall leading to the cubicles and I'd have to pass him to leave, this will also tell him he's not alone. Decision paralysis has gone on too long and boss has finished his phone call. At some point in time I must have made noise because he comes into my cubicle takes a look at me and tells me \"sorry you had to hear that.\" Shouldn't I be the one saying sorry?\n\n Well this awkward encounter has done some good and given boss somebody who he can vent to within office hours when divorce shenanigans happen.  Jump ahead a few months and I get the obligatory super secret message email that he needs to vent about divorce stuff. Stbx has been dragging feet and gave him the required sofa minus sofa cushions, deep freezer minus trays, truck minus keys. \n\nMe being the socially awkward dork that I am I make the comment at least she didn't put sofa cushions, baskets and keys into the deep freeze filling it full of water and turn it into great big ice cube. \n\nBoss has a truly shocked look and shudders. Then whispers \"can I use you for good?\" And gets a cat ate the canary smile. \n\nOne that I match. \"You want my inner vindictiveness unleashed on viper?\" He only answers with a nod and nothing is mentioned for months. Maybe a year.\n\nThen I get the super secret email from boss that means he needs to vent about viper.\n\nI go into his office and close the door where boss drops the news. Viper never followed up on divorce requirements of 1. Buy boss out of his portion of the house mortgage 2. Buy bosses portion of vipers car. And is behind on payments for both. Foreclosure and repossession proceedings behind on payments. Viper probably wanted to jeopardize his credit since he was looking into buying his own house and with his name still on those items will affect his credit and this is what he needed to vent about. He forgot about my vindictive desires to burn her.\n\nMy little shoulder devil is jumping and dancing with glee laughing muhaha: \"Isn't there a 30 day hold from foreclosure and or repossession where you can payoff? If you did this would the titles go into your name? Call your lawyer now!\"\n\nBoss once again looks at me in shock and terror, then calls his lawyer. Yes, the legal divorce fillings should protect his credit, but will take time since she didn't follow requirements he does have a option to payoff foreclosure and have title to the house transferred into his name this would clear up his credit quicker he could also do the same thing with her car. These may slow his ability to buy a home though. I'm in the office and blurred out \"that's what he's going to do! How soon? will additional eviction papers be needed? What's the process.\" Lawyer is quite for a few minutes then answers the questions. The old arcade game voice rings in my mind 'Total Carnage I love it!'\n\nWhen the call is done he tells me he doesn't really want the house because it's got a ton of negative memories for him and was viper's childhood home\nHe's quite for a bit then a slow smile spreads as a little devil light brightens his eyes. \"But it'll make a wonderful wedding present for our son.\" A son who viper treated as badly if not worse as boss.\n\nA few months later boss shows me a picture of Viper being put into a police car because she refused to leave the house. Boss took me to lunch and we drove in Viper's car. When he picked up the car he sent her a picture of his then and still current girlfriend driving vipers car.\n\nAbout a year after the foreclosure I attended his son's wedding at the foreclosure house and son cried when boss gave him the title to the house. Viper screamed and stormed off, I stop her before she can get into her car. \"You know if you hadn't filed for divorce because boss got cancer and told him 'for better or worse was your worst not his' I would have never encouraged him to buyout your home and car.\" Big shit eating smile full of teeth \"Tata\" 'Total Carnage I love it!'",

I've got a few items I'm trying to find and so I'm in the section for probably about 10 minutes. The guy doesn't get off the phone and his voice has tremendous projection so I'm getting quite annoyed. Since I'm a child of the '70s TV influence my sense of humor quite a bit. The logical thing of course for me is to take off my shoe and make a phone call on it just like James Bond satirist, Don Adams in \"Get Smart\". I'm wearing high tops so heck I'm in the fruit section, I pick up a banana and start greeting my cousin and start talking about the game on Sunday... Very loudly.   For the first time in 10 minutes the guy actually shuts up for a second, then I hear him speaking in a low voice saying \" some guys talking into a banana\"😂🤣 I love my mother for having such an off the wall sense of humor and absolutely no fear...!",

In our childhood they were quite mean with us and my sister, calling us dirty, poor, mocking our clothes, criticizing my mom’s job cuz “only losers teach”, etc.\n\nTime has passed and as my grandfather grew older and my uncles and aunt moved to other countries it was my family who looked after him. Last year of his life he became grateful towards us even called me “his little daughter”. I know this hurt my aunt deeply because she’s adopted but had to thank us for being here with him. \nFew years ago she had a daughter and whenever she comes for visiting I babysit her or help her with computer related stuff (I study IT) I help her in anything she needs with a smile. I can see glimpses of remorse, guilt and panic whenever I talk about when I was a kid to my cousin (I never mention names or anything that can lead my cousin to suspect from her mother) but still I never give her a chance to apologize because I change subject quickly and act oblivious as if I don’t remember well those years. I don’t want an apology, I want her to be remorseful and know how hypocrite she is all her life, and if helping her and her family makes the guilt even bigger then that’s an amazing bonus for me since I do love my cousin.\n\nMy other uncle got divorced last year for cheating her wife and now his children refuse to see him, he was the one who mocked my mom’s job and now doesn’t have money since his ex wife was the one paying for everything. For a while we used to cook for him despite him criticizing my mom’s cooking so many years before. He thanked us but started asking for more and more money very often and gave us attitude when we would ask the money back, so we stopped giving him as much. I know he doesn’t feel regret but I act friendly (my mom and sister avoid him). Every time I see him I ask him “How are &lt;my cousins names&gt; going?” “Will you spend this weekend with them?” And when he asks for money I don’t have in hand “Sorry, teacher’s salary is not enough right”. I say it in a worried or joking tone so it doesn’t come out as rude.\n\nJust for clarification my dad always stood up for us when his family miss treated us so I don’t blame him for anything. My parents reassured us that we were beautiful and valuable after every reunion but it’s something we just can’t forget.\nI could be cold and harsh like my sister but I rather not burn those bridges, I like helping and if I get to see the guilt piling up their shoulders and the shame of being helped by someone they underestimated, in first row seat makes me feel good.\n\nI know this is a mild revenge and maybe stupid but I wanted to share it.",

        "text": "This happened years ago, but I thought of it this morning and figured I'd share it.\n\nWhen I first had my baby, I was living in a cheap upstairs apartment. It didn't have the best insulation - I could hear my downstairs neighbors open and close their sliding door closet in the mornings.\n\nWell, these people just had no awareness of communal living. Any sound I made was a complaint to management. Soda bottle falls out of the fridge? Call to management. Cupboard door falls off the hinge without me touching it? Call to management. Drop the baby toy? Call to management. My friends had to tip toe up my stairs or else the neighbors called to complain.\n\nNeedless to say, I couldn't continue living there. So I made arrangements, turned in my notice and began packing.\n\nAnd if they thought I was loud before...\n\nI was already sleep deprived. So I just went with it. Stomping in my living room in the middle of the night packing. Tossing the packing tape into the air everytime I was done to let it \"thump\" a little louder onto the floor. The cheap knock-down furniture that I was tossing? Had my baby go to a friends home one night and got out the power drills to take everything apart and thump the pieces hard on the kitchen floor (linoleum is louder than carpet). \n\nI dragged this on for a good two weeks before having my guy friends come at 11pm in steel toed boots to move everything out. Petty? Yes. But oh so satisfying.",

D has countless times raised, screamed and belittled me, in person and mostly over the phone, accusing me of making mistakes that are actually just shopify technicalities... after some arguments, She decided she prefers to pay me by the hour rather than a full time salary. I agreed. \n\nThe time has come to pay me and has the audacity to not only pay me late but starts to argue with me about the rate itself and how i “dont deserve” not what I told her my rate is but significantly less because of “countless mistakes” My work is professional, aesthetically pleasing and right on brand for each of my clients. Everyone is pleased EXCEPT for her. I might have to accept the lower cost she demands to pay bc otherwise i cant pay my rent. I feel defeated but the little petty 😈 in me wants to feel the warm fuzzy satisfaction of her suffering my wrath🥰\n\nSo because violence is not “in” anymore 🙄 i need help to come up with devious ways to get her to taste her own medicine.

        "text": "During my highschool years, I have always hated doing projects, reporting, assignments, and research with a group. Before I get into details, I just want to throw in some minor details:\n\n- I grew up in a village on a mountain of indigenous people. My dad works as a security at some facility there and it was a win-win situation for our family to settle down there because me and my brother was always sick in the city. \n\n- The air was fresh, the water is unlimited and free, there is electricity. Roads are rough. We only need to walk to school. It was a peaceful place but filled with overly religious people. \n\n- I am not bragging but me and my siblings (over the years, there became five of us) are a little bit smarter than the rest of the students in that place. Me and my brother were consistently Top 1, both scholars, and are active in all community events. Both of us are teacher's pet, too. It was never a big deal at first because everyone knows everyone at that village. \n\nWe both were sometimes tasked to tutor our slow-learner classmates in Math- and I hated it. I would still do it and not show that I hate every minute of it. \n\n- I am introverted and I don't have the patience to teach\n- I don't like the idea of being responsible for someone else's grade all because I wasn't an effective tutor. It makes me anxious and the pressure of expectations are scary\n- main reason is: I don't know how to explain Math because I don't know how I understood it. When I hear it during class, I just know. But in their case, I had to break down every step and explain each steps that leads to the solution\n\nHowever, I still try to do my best and help out as much as I can. EXCEPT GROUP ACTIVITIES.  I can tolerate a partner BUT NOT A GROUP. \n\nSo for three years straight in high school, I've been known as The Soloist. I always do all group activities as solo and the teachers were okay that I'm the only one not in a group. I would still participate in a group if it's drama, music, performance for an event - but not reporting, research, etc. \n\nAt my fourth year, as a final project, we are required to do a research paper as a group. Naturally, I went up to my English teacher and asked that I shouldn't be in a group. That I could do everything on my own and still meet the deadline. She refused saying that I should learn to work with a team. \n\nI had no choice. The group consists of 5 students. They voted me as leader. The first task is to find an interesting subject, their suggestions were:\n\n\"It's up to you\"\n\"Whatever you want\"\n\"Just tell us what we should research about\"\n\"I don't know\"\nand\n\"I have no idea\"\n\nI decided we are going to do a research about SLEEP,  DREAMS,  AND NIGHTMARES\n\nI divided the work amongst us and I will collect whatever they have so far at end of everyday so I can compile and type it on my computer.\n\nNothing was done,  excuses were made, some of them got angry at me for being \"naggy\"\n\nI've been doing everything since day one because I knew this could happen and I wanted to avoid confrontations. But I still would assign something to them and would still ask at the end of the day. \n\nThere's no internet available in the village so I had to travel for 8hours as early as 4am to the nearest city to do research, I would spend most of my break in the school's library reading every book I can find, I would interview other people's perspective, beliefs, stories and opinion about the topic.\n\nFew days before deadline, groupmates were anxiously asking if I finished the paper. I said yes and asked if anyone of them would be willing to report about it so I can help him/her practice with the notes, no one volunteered. \nDay of the deadline came and I submitted the paper with only my name on it. \n\nThe teacher was mad at me for not \"involving\" my groupmates and for not \"working as a team\". She did not accepted the paper and told me to figure out how to fix this with the group. \n\nI was so angry at this point because I tried to work with them, I have been patient with them. \n\nGroupmates naturally found out about the paper and got angry at me, too. So,  I told them that if they really want to get grades for it they should be the one to report in front of the whole class. They should do a good job because 50% of the grade on the paper will come from the reporting.\n\nIt was amusing to see them struggle, stutter, stammer, in front of everyone. I did came in front and did the reporting while they stand silent at the corner of the stage. Afterwards, I told them they need to pay me money for all my expenses and troubles before I put their names in.",

With work, it would be fine if I did the whole thing because it wouldn’t be much, but on projects, I feel like I am more often than not exploited and taken advantage because I am a hard worker.\n\nLast month, we were assigned a partner project in our sports medicine class. We had to conduct an interview, make a board, rehearse a presentation, and write a lengthy essay. We had 3 weeks to do this, and I made a plan to split it up into equal parts. I told my partner all about this and she was in agreement. I kept checking in with her throughout the duration before it was due, and I thought she was all good. I was done with my half and everything. Then to my surprise she messages me “sorry can’t meet up and help. I have ROTC.” Keep in mind, she says this the day before the due date. \n\nThis would’ve been okay. I tried to be understanding and just asked her where the materials she had used for the project were so I could continue. When I went to fetch them to work on it, it was completely empty. Our project board had NOTHING on it, and even the most simplest task ever wasn’t done, which was to print images and credits. I would not accept a low grade, so I took it home and did everything by myself. \n\nI messaged her a few times with questions while working on it, to which she had very slow or vague responses, or none at all. Later she stopped responding around 11pm. I stayed up till 2am working, and I was livid. All I could think about was that she was probably sleeping soundly while I worked nonstop. \nI felt really bad I did it all myself, because I really thought I could rely on her. She is my friend though, and I didn’t want to break bridges.\n\nThe lunch before the presentation, she frantically asked for me to explain the presentation to her and whatnot- I ignored her and later said I was busy. Right before the presentation, I ended up not giving her the notecards I made to help her. She really struggled and sounded very uneducated and stupid about the subjects, while I did very well and it was obvious I knew the topic very well. She had to wing it, and didn’t even do it correctly. She wasn’t even completely sure what the topic was (even though I let her choose it) and said lots of wrong information. Classmates and the teacher stared at her with judge-mental looks and it was obvious she was embarrassed. She looked as if she was going to have a breakdown or something.\n\nIt lowered our joint grade by 20 points but it was worth it. I felt really good about it, now I feel a bit guilty though.",

The snow was perfectly packing, and it wasn’t bitter cold… all in all, epic conditions. We soon tired of throwing them at each other and turned our attention to the few cars out and about. We thought we had the perfect concealed spot to carry out the attacks. We did not consider that the freshly fallen snow would not allow us to conceal ourselves, should the car owners decide to pursue us. (Give me a break, I was 14 or 15 at the time; critical thinking was not part of my makeup).  We lobbed at a few cars, they slowed, but did not stop… until… This guy slams on his brakes, jumps out of his car and starts giving chase. We take off through back yards, scattering like the rats we were. He decides he can’t catch us, goes back to his car and circles the block, looking for tracks. When he got back in his car, we decided we were in the clear, and banded back together… He comes around the corner, our adrenaline kicked in, and it was back to the races… through some more back yards we go, trying to elude him. He gets back in his car… we think we’re safe again. We stayed split up this time… I decide to hide on a neighbor’s front porch, not realizing or processing that I’m leaving tracks in the fresh snow. Around the corner he comes again, sees the tracks, and bam, I’m caught. He grabs me by the hood of my coat and starts yelling at me. I don’t remember exactly what he said, but asked my name and where I lived. Of course I gave him a fake name and address, but he seemed satisfied, as he knew someone in that area of town. Cue the petty revenge on his part. He made me get down on my knees and kiss his car and say “I’m sorry car”. I did as I was told… To this day, I’m waiting on a kid to hit my vehicle with a snowball, so I can pay it forward to another dim witted kid.",

My bf has pretty low self-esteem, and even admitted that if he wasn’t taken he would have gone for it. He swiftly blocked her on snap.\nSo we come to today.

I asked my bf's mom if she could get me one of the little hats they wear and order Isreal's flag, I wore the hat made my bf wear his, and hung Isreal's flag behind us then I face-timed my parent. The look on their faces was so satisfying, my father asked if this was a prank I told him no and that I am gay and introduced to my Jewish bf and told them I am converting to Judaism, my mother started crying and my father started shouting and throwing slurs at us.I was going to end it here but tbh I thought why not go the extra mile so I shouted at my father to shut up as there is more I told him that when I get married I am talking my husband's name(I am his only son) and we will have kids through surrogacy using my bf's sperm and I will raise them then I finished by letting him know that I am the bottom(it was just to piss him off why won't say if it is the truth), my father ended the call after that.\n\n\nMy sister is mad at me because now she has to pick a side either go back to my parents or stay in Canada with me, she said if I just told them I was gay and left it at that she would have told them she was going to stay to convince me to be Muslim and straight again but now my parents don't care and want nothing to do with me so, I only feel a little bit of regret for my sister",

But as I was about to open the door some of them start throwing the snowballs at me. I confronted them asking why they do that and that they should stop - which they didn't do because they felt suuper cool/confident in their group. I rly had enough after today's work so I went up to them, which they didn't expect (maybe because I am a woman and they thought I'd rather back off). They got intimidated for a bit but then one kid (who I will call little shit from now on) got really cocky in front of his friends and started insulting me. So I distracted him a little, while I grabbed some snow and then smeared it all over his face. I rly did not hurt him in any way - well maybe except for his ego, cause little shit really went nuts after this and tried to hit me. LOL. But I am quite tall and trained martial arts for a while so he was more like an angwy dog trying to nibble at my fingers. So as he tried to hit me he was more ore less just swinging in the air not being effective at all. It was fucking hilarious and I had to laugh which made him even angrier. This was so satisfying and I think I will cherish this moment of putting little shit into his place my entire life. I hope his parents while thank me for the free parenting I did. Hahaha.",

        "text": " Over the course of the past Summer and Fall my significant other and I have had some issues with the new neighbours that moved into the top apartment of the triplex we live in. They are fairly inconsiderate with some things like not sorting their trash and recycling but most of all with the parking situation.  There are three parking spots with their own individual driveway but the thing is this family owns two cars and on many occasions they would double park their other vehicle in front of our driveway blocking us in. \n\n  \nAt first it wasn’t that big a deal we would just ask them to politely move it and someone would come down and move the car.  Then it started becoming a constant thing my fiancé would be leaving late for work even at some points they wouldn’t awnser the door when we would ring the bell. Eventually it got to the point where the police were called, they came and gave them a warning and told them the next time they would show up a ticket would be issued.     \n\n\nThis didn’t solve anything because the very next day they continued to do the same thing. We called the police again and they would take a long time to show up and the family would just move their car before the authorities would get here.   Fast forward a few months to winter time and my part of Canada received its first major snowfall where we received 32cm (12 inches) of snow. Me being the fairly passive aggressive person that I am decided to take my opportunity to extract my petty revenge once and for all.    \n\n\nWhile shovelling my drive way I piled up all the snow right onto the front of theirs blocking in their car.  This morning their entire family was out in full effect trying to dig their car out. They don’t own a shovel and asked to use ours. They are also under the assumption the city did this.  I’ve been laughing manically to myself all morning while drinking my coffee and eating breakfast.   \n\n\n[Image for context](https://imgur.com/a/6ljoALH)  \n\n\nAll that just to say... please be considerate of your neighbors and don't double park",

Which I should have seen coming to be honest. He has always been known for anger issues.\nAnyways- I didn’t mind his insults to me too much as it wasn’t that bad. But he started picking on new people in our friend group (we shared a group). Like insulting my friend who just had their heart broken by a girl. Or making fun of how one of our other friends pronounces a word differently (they grew up somewhere different from us so that’s why it’s a abnormal thing).\nAs things slowly progressed and progressed some people cut him off and blocked him while still being my friend as they have known me longer and know I didn’t deserve to be with my ex. I was apparently too good.\nIt got to the point my ex would mainly call me to get his frustrations out by swearing, insults. Anything that could soothe his rage. And then proceeded to go to his friends for D&amp;D for stress relief by relaxing.\n\nI left him in July because I was a pushover and I was still scared to lose him due to him being my first relationship and due to him being so caring in the beginning. I clung onto that even though I was falling out of love for him.\nUntil my best friend pushed me to break up with my ex as I would be happier and that I was too good for my ex. So I did.\nThen I’m November my ex finally contacted me again. Saying a girl confessed to him. One of my other friends. He claimed they were together but she said they were still just friends. \nI talked to her after the break up explaining why I did it since I knew they were close- I’m not sure why she confessed. Apparently it was just childhood feelings.\nBut I explained in detail that he was comparing us at that moment. “I miss how you did this…” “[Friends name] acts like this”. And how he is still being a pain to deal with.\n\nShe understood and I even convinced her to block him. Which shattered his heart. The worst part is. I already knew he loved her. While I was with him.\nThen I blocked him and my other friends had already blocked him ages ago.",

It was very busy and so as I saw someone returning their trolley, I decided to wait for them to come out so I could take their space.\n\nAs they reversed towards me, to head towards the exit that was in the other direction, a car the other side of them was driving up and immediately sped into the space. Very frustrating but I thought nothing of it as there's no point getting annoyed by these things.\n\nThen the car on the driver's side of the annoying car put its reverse lights on. I let them come out and went to drive into their space.\n\nBy this point, the annoying car driver hadn't left his car and I saw that his tyres were slightly over the line. For those who don't know what spaces are like in the UK, they're very small. I could tell that there was a lot of space the other side of the car, so it wasn't as though they were forced to park like that.\n\nSo when I pulled into the space, I parked normally and completely in the centre of the space, not slightly to one side.\n\nI got out of the car and walked away. I heard a car door open and looked back and saw this very overweight guy trying to get out of his car with very little space. He gave up after a minute, started his car again to rejig his car so it fit the space better.\n\nSide note: as he was trying to get out of his car, I took a picture because I suspected he may try and dent my door. If I had a picture of him doing it, with his numberplate in view, that would be good evidence to claim on insurance if he had dented my door. Fortunately, he hadn't and there wasn't even a minor scratch.",

        "text": "Not 100% sure if this fits as petty revenge, but anyway.\n\nFor context I had worked at a fast food chain for several years after highschool and during uni, quickly becoming management. It was one of those absolutely shit jobs for a horrible company, but somehow had the best co-workers of any job to date so good employees (at least for a bit) stuck around for each other.\n\nAround when I became a manager the store manager also changed hands, between us and my only decent franchisee we took our store from ranking roughly 320/800 to top 50 within a financial quarter, so I was confident I knew the ins and outs of running a store well.\n\nOnce I'd finished my studies I moved town and needed an income as soon as I moved so I transferred my position. The new store was happy to have an experienced manager and I was admittedly excited to hopefully pull the same kind of performance.\n\nI quickly realised this wouldn't be happening because simply put, the franchisee and store manager didn't care enough. About anything.\n\nI had been signed on as  permanent part time, however they treated me as a casual. Shifts constantly moved, no sick or annual leave ever paid out, and no casual loading. On top of an increased work load because I was the only management who cared (I did have several amazing juniors but in that environment there is only so much they can do). One day I'd had enough. One thing turned into another and I decided that close would be my last one.\n\nHere's the revenge part - their in house roster system was linked to an app and your email. It knew if you were full time, part time or casual, and if you had any shifts that fell outside of guaranteed shifts (for full or part time only) you were meant to manually accept or decline the shift in the roster. Now, I never actually accepted or declined a single shift.  Because of this, I was able to write out a 2 week resignation and then decline my shifts for the next 2 weeks (as I had NO guaranteed hours in my roster as ppt). This included the manager close I had the next day, meaning I got to legally walk away after closing up the store.\n\nThings get even better though, I was still pissed at all the leave and casual loading I lost, so I sent an email explaining the situation to head office and fair work. Because I had never accepted any shifts that were all \"variations of my work schedule\" every single hour I worked in that store was classed as overtime. They had to pay me out for 3 months of overtime payments because they tried to save a few dollars on the hour.\n\nSeveral more months passed, franchisee and store manager drop off the face of the earth. I can only imagine they got caught doing the same thing to other employees and went bust in pay outs.\n\nTldr- boss tried to short change me and had to pay out months of overtime",

I am a very petty introverted person so I have a lot of stories to tell that I couldn't share in person (I might have shared most of it to my husband)\n\nFirst year, second semester, I was 15 years old, taking IT (course).\nI hated one of my professors because he was\n- unreasonable\n- always late but we couldn't be late because he would lock the doors\n- would give activities, quizzes, exams on topics he never discussed properly\n- always answered questions with sarcasm and insults\n- expected us to just know everything overnight by reading those papers he hands out\n- most of the time absent but would not let us know so we couldn't leave the room\n- we couldn't talk to him in his office\n- would blame us when he lost most of our submitted assignments\n\nFYI, our campus is located in a humid city. Which is why most classrooms have ACs.\n\nAll of his class is assigned to this one huge classroom which has 2 AC's installed. I figured he hated the cold, however I've never seen him wore a sweater, he would always adjust the temperature so he wouldn't be cold.\n\nI got so annoyed at him that I figured out his schedule, sneaked in his classroom a few minutes before his class started to lower both ACs to the lowest setting, closed the door, and threw the remote control in the closest opened bag which happened to be my classmate's.\n\nSince it was a few days before exam week, all professors are required not to miss a class, so I know that he would be there 101%\n\nThe classroom has this large glass which mean I can see inside from the hallway. Every students always bring their own sweaters and he's there looking sooooo annoyed and pissed because he couldn't find the remote.\n\nI went to my apartment satisfied and laughing my ass out when I found out the next day that the room is still freezing cold. Apparently, my classmate took 2 whole days to find out that the remote is in his bag all along.\n\nIt's probably the pettiest revenge that I took too far.",
