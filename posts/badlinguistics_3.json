        "text": "[https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/28/politics/teacher\\-trump\\-grammar\\-letter/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/28/politics/teacher-trump-grammar-letter/index.html)\n\nThis story has been in the news the past week and it really irks me. I'm a language teacher and the way the media as well as this teacher are peddling this story is, in my opinion, a classic case of r/badlinguistics \\(well, more like r/badrhetoric\\). First there are no grammatical errors in this letter. What this teacher corrected were stylistic errors and not all of them are clear errors. The government compiles a stylistic guide which says:\n\n&gt;3.21 The  similar  designations  *commonwealth,  confederation  \\(federal\\),  government, nation \\(national\\), powers, republic*, etc., are capitalized only if used as part of proper names, as proper names, or as proper adjectives.\n\nSo it is true that many of the capitalized nouns in the letter are stylistic errors such as \"Federal system\" but others are less clear. An example is \"Nation.\" Could this be referring to the United States as a nation and thus it would be valid to capitalize it? Or perhaps the capitalization of Nation could be considered a personification which is capitalized per rule 3.34?\n\n&gt;3.34. A vivid personification is capitalized.\n\nShe also marks the letter's apparent overuse of the first person to start sentences. This isn't even a stylistic error, this is just an opinion, and in my opinion a bit of an unfounded one since the very goal of the letter is to present the point of view of the addressee of the original letter.\n\nAnd of course if we wanted to be pedantic we could mention the teacher's use of \"OMG\" and \"y'all\" which would violate stylistic guidelines for formal writing.\n\nI don't have an issue with someone calling out the president or the White House for poor writing skills when it is merited but here, with the exception of some overzealous capitalization, all of the errors are stylistic and many open to interpretation. Some fall within the purview of the government's style guide and none of them are \"grammar errors\" as the media is reporting. I would appreciate your input. It could very well be that I am way off base here or reading into things too much. ",

The same word is used for \"one\" in Etruscan.\n\nAnd later\n&gt;Basque huts \"empty\" (used for \"zero\"), Niger-Congo pu, pul, \"empty\", Ewe ful \"empty\", Tschi huhuw \"empty\", Guang fulu \"empty\", Grebo pulu, pudu \"to be empty\", Yoruba ofurfu \"emptiness\", Igbo afulu \"empty\", Efik ifu \"vain, worthless\", Avatime pluplu \"empty\", Temne fu \"in vain\", Sussu fu \"nothing\". Compare pol \"empty\".  The Tschi form with an initial h explains the initial h of Basque.\n\nSo, the Basque word *hut-s* is related to both the Niger-Congo *ku* and Niger-Congo *pu* at the same time. \n",
