Many people would disagree, but it might look strange to go up to them and be like, \"Hey, I saw you in class and I think you look cool and I want to be friends.\" I personally find that to be very awkward, and though I do it sometimes, it's not my favorite.\n\nInstead what you should do is go up to them and say something like, \"Hey, you look a little familiar. Did you go to high school near here (or whatever your hometown is assuming you're far from home)?\" When they say no or clarify where they're from, you can use it as an opportunity to organically branch the conversation further into different topics.\n\nI personally think that this is a good way of befriending people without appearing too direct and looking more natural.",

If you feel like they are difficult to understand, you may be right depending on your education, but unless you have a legitimate learning disability, you can sort most of the understanding out in 12 months. That doesn't mean you'll have a six-pack, all the friends in the world, and 7 million dollars, but you'll understand how to get those.\n\nDo not approach popular culture for any of the three. Jim Cramer, Brene Brown, and Joe Rogan are not your friends. Instead, focus on people who live their lives researching these topics and, ideally, can prove their findings. Find their teachers. Then find their enemies or critics and compare arguments.\n\nExamples (not exhaustive at all):\n\nFinancial: You may have heard of Warren Buffett. The man had an enviable start -- white middle class American -- but what's key about him is that he has simple, fundamental principles that have turned his wealth into proven billions _through investing alone_. What did he do? Can you do it? Who did he learn from? While you're at it, read some university textbooks like The Four Pillars of Investment.\n\nPhysical: Check out actual schools and hospitals that have extensive information like The Mayo Clinic and The Harvard School of Public Health. Check out the habits of Olympic champions, their coaches, and bodybuilders. Schwarzenegger didn't get that body from intermittent fasting.\n\nMental: Buddhist psychology is 2500 years old, Western is 150. That's a 25 -1.5 ratio. If you needed open heart surgery and one dude had 25 years experience, the other 1.5, would you not at least have a chat with the older doctor? Meditation is free, why not give it a try? Start reading the basics on CBT, DBT, and Freudian vs other concepts. Go fundamental.\n\nMost people cannot be doctors, bank owners, and monks. But most people can understand the fundamentals.",

What I mean is at least check their reviews first before making a choice and take all reviews, positive and negative seriously. If you choose a school with bad reviews without taking them seriously you'll possible regret it and have a \\*\\*\\*\\* up time there so really take them seriously. If there aren't any schools (with the study you want to take but this applies only to vocational school, college and universities) and the good schools (with possibly the study you want to follow) are a bit further away from you please consider the good schools further away. This will mean you have to travel a bit more but if this means that those schools are better then the closest school from you then it would be worth a consideration and to check them out. When I have chosen my vocational school with the study Software Developer I didn't take reviews seriously and expected that the closest school was good enough. Other schools which were better than that school (also the current school sadly) were like +10 km away but in the country where I live the public transit is free for students and the system is very good and seamlessly synced with each other so it's a no brainer to travel but me with my dumbass brain didn't wanted to get up on for example 6:00 AM in the morning to travel for for example 1 hour to school so I chose my current school. But then something private happened and the only thing I can say that it was very ****** up and I then immediately started to have regret that I chose the current school, I wished then and still now that I took the negative reviews seriously and never chose this school but another. Even if it means that it'll take a while to travel to school and back home.\nTake this from someone that has experienced the consequences of not taking reviews seriously and unquestioningly chose the closest school with the study Software Developer near me.",
