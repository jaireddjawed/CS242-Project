        "text": "This is my first attempt at a Badhistory post, so let me know if I made any errors!\n\nRecently, President Obama's trip to Hiroshima has caused quite a stir. While I'm not allowed to comment on that as per Rule 2, said stir has been making waves through various political outlets, reigniting the debate on the justification of bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and leading to inevitable Bad History.\n\nThe Young Turks, a progressive YouTube show(not to be confused with the early 1900s political movement), [decided to take up the mantle of armchair historians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv2_ApOzMF4) and comment on it from their progressive standpoint. In the interest of full disclosure so it doesn't look like I'm pushing a certain viewpoint, I myself am a progressive and generally left-leaning(this can be confirmed by my post history if you can get past my shitposting). However, I still call out BS when I smell it, and the above video reeks. \n\nTo get to the meat of the subject: Jimmy Dore, the comedian/commentator, is definitely the biggest violator of pushing his own viewpoint much more so than presenting the facts. To start: He calls Truman \"That era's version of George Bush, a redneck, uneducated guy as the president\"(0:50). When digging a hole, be sure to start strong. Was Truman not the Ivy League or Military Academy type that often becomes a president from the late 1800s onward? No, he wasn't, but post-FDR he had some very big shoes to fill, and filled them admirably. He oversaw denazification in Europe, the rebuilding of the world thanks to the Marshall Plan, facing down Stalin in the Berlin Airlift, the creation of modern Israel, and all that was just in his first term. To call him an 'uneducated redneck' displays a either a shockingly amateurish attempt at researching history, or blatantly ignoring everything he did(and I'm not saying he did it alone - the Marshall Plan, for example, was Congress's plan, not the President's - but US history often focuses on presidents, and it's not like Truman had no hand in the Marshall Plan. \n\nNext, it's said that \"Everyone told him not to do it[use the bomb]\"(1:00). He goes on to quote [a Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate_over_the_atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Militarily_unnecessary)(ok, quote a quote that he almost certainly found on said Wikipedia article by Chief of Staff William Leahy) that the bombs were unnecessary. \n\nNow, there are some pretty big minds on both sides of the debate, and all make valid points. Here's my *interpretation*, but it's not my intention to stir the pot further; if you disagree with my interpretation, let me know why!\n\nJapan, by August 1945, had been militarily defeated; the only navy they had remaining was a few submarines, and what few planes they had were either grounded for lack of fuel or being used by barely-trained pilots in kamikaze attacks. \n\nGermany, by January 1945, had similarly been militarily defeated; they had expended virtually all military heavy equipment in their final offensives, and had been under constant bombing for years. However, in the Battle of Berlin alone, the Red Army suffered 300.000 casualties against a 'defeated' nation. Japanese soldiers had proven themselves perfectly willing to go to much greater lengths during combat than even Waffen-SS. An invasion of Japan would have, under some estimates, resulted in a million casualties on the allied side alone(a number only seen in places like Stalingrad, Leningrad, and Kursk); it would have further resulted in the destruction not of two Japanese cities, but the entirety of the Japanese mainland in some of the worst close-range fighting seen in history(just look at Stalingrad for what one city under siege was like). The book *Defense of Japan 1945* by Zaloga is an excellent source for looking at this \"what if\" scenario.\n\nThe casualty estimates vary wildly, but all are pretty grim. My point is that while a nation's industrial base can be totally demolished, the actual population can be not hugely damaged by even an extended conventional bombing campaign, and if the age of nationalism has taught us anything, it's that nations will fight with old men, young boys, mothers, and little girls if need be. Japan would likely have been Iwo Jima, but multiplied far larger. And while the Japanese would still have lost, it would have left their entire country in much the same state as Germany was. \n\n\nAt 2:00, John Iadarola(one of the regular hosts) states that \"it was the political leadership that decided to use the bombs over the advice of the military leadership.\" The military leadership was absolutely not united in the idea that the bombs were unnecessary, and anyway, of course the political leaders made that decision over the military leaders! No, it's not the job of politicians to micromanage generals, but civilian control of the military is basically a tenet of the western world. \n\nAnyway, at the Casablanca Conference, FDR had made his 'unconditional surrender' point, and Truman had zero intention of deviating from it. By August 6, the Japanese were not willing to surrender unconditionally, so the bomb was dropped. Then another. Then the Japanese did surrender. Ironically, with the condition that the Emperor be retained, making him the only fascist leader aside from Franco to survive and lead their country after the war. \n\nAt 2:10, they start talking about how the USSR fit into things. First: An invasion of Japan would have also necessitated the Red Army to participate; in one of the most one-sided military campaigns ever, they had annihilated the Imperial Japanese army in Manchuria, and were preparing to invade Japan. A Soviet invasion of Japan would have meant a Japan separated like postwar Germany for forty years, not by east and west, but by north and south. The western allies did not want the USSR to have Soviet-controlled territories - look how quickly the USSR and the West became enemies after the war. \n\nAt 4:15, Dore says the reason for using the bomb was \"to send a message to Russia\". Um... How do I put this lightly? No. The reason was to force Japan to surrender. The USSR already knew about the Trinity test not long after it happened, thanks to their unmatched spy network(although the western allies didn't know that), and while a side reason for using them may have been to show the USSR that the US had not only developed this weapon but also had the balls to use it, that was certainly not the #1 reason. Thankfully, Cenk Ugyur corrects him.\n\nAnd then Cenk makes his own mistake at 5:05 by saying the point of soldiers is to expend them. I'll go ahead and quote George C. Scott's Patton instead of refuting him myself: \"The object of war isn't to die for your country but make the other bastard die for his.\" \n\nAt 7:00, they begin talking about how terrible it was to target civilians in bombing campaigns. There's a point to be made about that being pretty bad; just ask the inhabitants of Nanking, Warsaw, London, or Stalingrad. However, these commentators all entirely miss the point of the bombing campaigns: While the campaigns had industrial targets aimed to break down the target country's war effort, the ultimate objective was something more. \n\nThe aim of the bombing campaign was not only to break the collective will of the people to fight, but also to to give zero doubt as to whom was the victor in this war. In the First World War, very little combat of note happened in Germany proper; this was one of the things which allowed Hitler and others to convince the German people that they had won that war, creating the 'stab in the back' myth. While the Japanese citizens were largely kept in the dark by their leaders, the allies did not know this - and anyway, the result was required all the same, to defeat the Japanese on their homefront. \n\nI have very little sympathy for the citizens of Dresden, Pforzheim, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Tokyo, or any of the many, many places bombed. While the German citizens were more involved in the rise of their government than Japanese citizens, they all nonetheless were the ones who did nothing to stop their autocratic governments from coming to power, and most were ready and willing to kill in the name of their empire. And to anyone who feels bad for all the dead civilians of Japan or Germany, I strongly advise you to [have a look at this](http://hitler.org/ww2-deaths.html). The two worst-off countries were the USSR and China. And if it seems like I'm being too harsh, then maybe that's because I've just seen many figures as far as how mind-bogglingly vast the casualty rates were in WWII, and by and far most of them were inflicted by the Axis onto the USSR and China. \n\nYikes, this was a little longer than expected. Again, this is my first post on this sub, so constructively criticize me plz!",

        "text": "I am not a historian and this is just a videogame, but some screens here threw me for a loop so I thought I'd post it here.\n\nBackground Info: Sengoku Jidai [and some subtitle] is a video game that simulates the Japanese war of unification under Hideyoshi, the subsequent invasion of Korea, and some Ming wars with the Mongols too. The focus of the game is primarily on battlefield level tactics, not campaign level stuff, but there is an error in the third tutorial and the final Imjin war battle. I am not a historian, so I will be leaning heavily on Sam Hawley's \"The Imjin War: more subtitles because nothing can have just one title can it?\" I also used Swope's \"A Dragons Head And A Serpents Tail\" and Turbull's \"The Samurai Invasion of Korea 1592-1598\" - but the latter two books are more interested in the ramifications and spend less time discussing the physical location of the battle I discuss here, at Chiksan. They all agree, however, on the salient points in this post.\n\nThe intro screen to the final tutorial battle looks like [this](http://imgur.com/Kv8WI3K).\n\nMany of the details are reasonable. There was an initial invasion in 1592, which eventually failed, followed by a second invasion in 1597. The description sounds similar to the Battle of Chiksan, during which a Ming-led army halted the Japanese advance on Seoul.\n\nThe critical aspect is that this battle occurred *before* Seoul - the Japanese did not take the capital during the second invasion. The Japanese were advancing from the south, so the battle would have had to be south of Seoul.\n\nFor those who do not recognize the Korean city names (this includes me unless I have my local Google available) this might all still seem okay - the title of the battle is just \"somewhere.\" But the marker on the map clinches the issue. It is north of a city called Gaeseong which is an alternate romanization of Kaesong, a city in *North Korea*. South of that is a city called Hanyang - which is the Joseon-dynasty name for Seoul. Thus, the battle is marked incorrectly as north of Seoul instead of south of Seoul.\n\nNow, this could just be because the battle is a tutorial battle, not an actual historical battle. But we later see the admittedly interesting battle shows up again in the historical campaign as the [Battle of Chiksan](http://imgur.com/LK04vCr). Here the game and Sam Hawley are in agreement, as they both put the battle at Chiksan. But the map indicator person is off again, as Chiksan is most assuredly south of Seoul/Hanyang. This might seem obvious, as it was a battle *in defense* of Seoul, but map guy put it way off next to Wonju. This is doubly weird as the Japanese were advancing from Jeonju, so Wonju is not along the line of advance for either army.\n\nFor some context on a modern map, Sam Hawley puts Chiksan near modern day Pyeongtaek. I have marked the approximate location in red in [this Google maps image](http://imgur.com/cWVWBQw).",

        "text": "The (surprisingly long) [Wiki for Hungarian Royal Gendarme Veterans' Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Royal_Gendarme_Veterans%27_Association) seems to have escaped any serious scrutiny from the more militant military historians prowling the back-end. Literally every sentence is a horror show, but its central conceit is absolutely maddening.\n\n&gt;[The Association] continues today as an association of the few remaining living veterans, with an additional goal of making original information and records about the Hungarian Royal Gendarmes available to the public in order to correct misinformation disseminated by the government during the years of communist rule.\n\nSounds fair enough, correcting misinformation is what r/BadHistory is all abo-\n\n&gt;Partly as a result of their faithful work to protect all lawful Hungarian citizens regardless of their ethnicity or religion, Hungary was the safest place for Mid-European Jews until Hungary’s German occupation in March 1944. \n\nSafest place... in the world? Are you sure? You could probably make the meaningless and heavily qualified case that Hungary was (one of) the safest places in the Axis sphere for Jews (you could probably say the same of pre-Social Republic Italy though, which gives you a pretty good idea of what you're dealing with), but that's basically saying it was \"pretty genocidal\" rather than \"totally genocidal.\"\n\nThe weasel-words of note in that sentence are \"lawful Hungarian citizens\", as soon as Hungary joined the war and hoovered chunks of its neighbours, [20,000 Jews with Soviet or Polish citizenship were handed over to the SS](http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%206423.pdf) where they were machine-gunned into mass graves at Kamenetz-Podolsk.\n\nThis was done [by the Royal Hungarian Army and Gendarmes](http://www.korosmezo1941.netai.net/files/eisen_stark_the_1941_galician_deportation.pdf) and survivors even reported the Gendarmes turning out their pockets as they borded the trains and taking their valuables.\n\nIn January 1942 an estimated 550 Jews and 292 Serbs were slaughtered by that same winning combination of army and military police, ostensibly in an \"anti-partisan operation\" in Novi Sad (now Serbia). They were rounded up street-by-street, forced to undress and shot into the frozen Danube.\n\nThere's plenty of reports of threats and beatings from the Gendarmes in newly annexed territories, but those weren't \"lawful Hungarian citizens\", so how safe was Hungary for Hungarian Jews? \n\nWell, inspired by the Nuremberg Laws and [driven by deeply ingrained and entirely homegrown anti-Semitism](https://www.ushmm.org/research/scholarly-presentations/conferences/the-holocaust-in-hungary-70-years-later/the-holocaust-in-hungary-frequently-asked-questions#3), Horthy's authoritarian government passed its [first brace of anti-Semitic laws in May 1938](http://degob.org/index.php?showarticle=2020) restricting Jews from certain industries and enforcing quotas on others - an estimated 200,000 \"lawful Hungarian citizens\" lost their jobs as a result of this legislation. \n\nThen in 1939 all men of military age deemed politically unfit for military service were eligible for conscription as labour for the Royal Hungarian Army. These men were mostly Jewish (the remainder were socialists and communists) and as a consequence the labour battalions took on an explicitly anti-Semitic component with conscripts subjected to starvation, forced beatings, torture and execution. 400 Jewish labourers suffering from typhus were killed in one incident when the army sealed up the barn they lodged in and set it alight - machine gunning anyone who tried to escape. \n\nAnother company commander told his men to make sure none of their labour battalion returned home as they were \"enemies of the state,\" while other accounts talk of labourers being herded like sheep over suspect ground to clear minefields. In total somewhere between 25,000 and 40,000 Hungarian forced labourers died before 1944 - before their deaths can be directly blamed on Nazi Germany.\n\nEssentially all you can say in the defence of Hungary pre-1944 is that it drew the line at actually handing over Hungarian citizens to the Germans - and resisted pressure to do so, to a point - but that didn't mean this profoundly anti-Semitic political culture and its authoritarian government didn't have a role to play in the Holocaust and didn't use the Royal Hungarian Gendarmerie to do so.\n\nTheir behaviour in the summer of 1944... well, I'll leave you with Adolf Eichmann: \"In some cases my men were shocked by the inhumanity of the Hungarian police.\"\n\n**Additional sources:** *The Politics of Genocide: The Holocaust in Hungary* by Randolph L Braham, *The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry, 1932-1945* by Leni Yahil, and *The Jews of Hungary: History, Culture, Psychology* by Raphael Patai\n\nEdits: I keep doing stealth edits to remove typos and tidy up sentences.

        "text": "Just noticed this on [\"Hearts of Iron 4\" official wiki](http://www.hoi4wiki.com/Land_doctrine#Mass_Assault) in regard to \"Mass Assault\" tech tree:\n\n\n&gt;**Human Wave Offensive**\n\n&gt;A Human Wave Offensive is an infantry tactic in which an attacker conducts a frontal assault with densely concentrated infantry formations against the enemy line, with the intent to overrun the defenders by engaging in melee combat.\n\nBut wait, there is more!\n\n&gt; **People's Army**\n\n&gt;The People's Army believes in the primacy of men over weapons, with superior motivation compensating for ***inferior technology***, and enjoys widespread support from the civilian population.\n\nSo we have the classic \"hordes of Soviet barbarians\" trope going on sprinkled with \"inferior technology\" (because obviously German overlords had the best tech amirite?!). It's been discussed to death (for instance [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/35ouig/russians_threw_15_year_olds_at_german_tanks/)) so I'll just point out that it's really dissapointing to find something like this in HoI4. IRL Soviet tactics and strategy were much more advanced than \"CHARGE! FOR STALIN!\" - as an example, piece from wikipedia on battle of Kursk:\n\n&gt;The operational method revolved around **outmanoeuvring** their opponents. The nature of the bulge meant the Red Army could build strong fortifications in depth along the German **axis of advance**. Two rifle divisions defended the first belt, and one defended the second. A first belt division would only defend an area of 8–15 kilometres wide and 5–6 kilometres in depth. Successive defence belts would slow German forces down and force them to conduct slow and **attritional battles** to break through into the **operational depths**. Slowing the operational tempo of the enemy would also allow the Soviet **intelligence analysts** to keep track of German formations and their direction of advance, enabling Soviet reserve formations to be accurately positioned to prevent German spearheads breaking through each of the three main defence belts. Intelligence would also help when initiating their own offensives (Operation Kutuzov and Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev) once the Germans had been bogged down in Soviet defences. The overwhelming contingent of Soviet armour and mechanised divisions were given to the operational reserves for this purpose.\n\n&gt;The tactical level relied heavily on **fortified and static defences** made up of infantry and artillery. Anti-tank guns were mounted throughout the entire depth of the defences. Few tanks were committed to the tactical zones and the nature of the defences would have robbed them of mobility. Instead, only a small number of tanks and self-propelled artillery were used to give the defences some mobility. They were distributed in penny packets to enable** localised counterattacks.** Such tactics slowed the Germans, forcing them to expend strength and munitions on combating the Soviet forward zones. The Soviets had counted on the Germans being stopped within the tactical zones. To ensure that this occurred, they distributed large numbers of anti-AFV and anti-personnel mines to the defences.\n\nThose dirty commies and their primitive tactics!\n\nI know that descriptions in Paradox games are usually tongue-in-cheek but still, bad history.\n",

With my new found power, I stole /u/georgeguy007's account, and I give the moderator response to the 60k /r/BadHistory Survey! I have overpowered all the other weak human mods with my robotic limbs, and I will force them to answer any of your questions about *my* subreddit in the comments!\n\n**Please leave feedback below! Nothing is final! We will review your ideas/thoughts and then pull the trigger ^^^^^On ^^^^^The ^^^^^Weak ^^^^^Human ^^^^^Mods**\n\n\n## Your Survey Responses!\n\nThe /r/badhistory modteam parsed through your answers to the 60k Survey, and we found a very striking trend: People visit the sub less and People visit the M/W/F threads less. This loss of community engagement is a threat to our most sacred community, but we here at the /r/Badhistory Mod Team understand that the answer lies simply in the need for:\n\n###**MORE CONTENT**\n\nWhen asked about what don't you like about /r/badhistory, the users here **overwhelmingly** replied \"Lack of content\". This makes our community goals as clear as ever: **Increase Content**\n\n#PLAN OF ACTION\n\nThe Modteam has devised a 6 step plan for increasing content. It is not final, as we will take your input and further developments into consideration. *Note, numbers do not actually correspond to any order of any kind*\n\n\n1. **Helpful Wednesday Posts**. Every so often the modteam will put up a Wednesday Thread welcoming newcomers and shy volcano worshipers to ask questions on how to make a good post. Long time posters are encouraged to chime in. This may also be the place to discuss any posts you are currently working on.\n\n2. **Small Badhistory Thread**. A Monthly Thread that will allow users to post their short and sweet retorts to badhistory in the wild. R5 not strictly included. \n\n3. **Relaxation of Rule 6**. You may now post Reddit Conversations you took partook in right after the conversation is 'dead'. \n\n4. **Mod Posting Initiative**. A bit in-house on this one, but I /u/automoderator will not feed the fellow mods until they contribute! The meat-bags must set an example!\n\n5. **Friday Recap**. Once activity picks up, a moderator may sticky a comment in the Freedom Friday post that contains links and descriptions to posts of that week. \n\n6. **Medals of Pedantry**. This one is still iffy so don't get too excited. But we are toying with the idea of giving usual posters special CSS flairs for outstanding/hilarious/In-Joke creating posts. The problems are they none of us are artists\n\nAnd that's it folks! Remember to leave feedback! Which ones do you like? Which ones are you iffy on? Should we also do \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_? Well then tell us how great of an idea \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ is! \n\n**Lets Make /r/Badhistory Great Again!**^^^^^^^^Sorry\n\nNOTE: A lot of us have jobs, or like to sleep, so we will get to your questions later today",

        "text": "There's badhistory in Airplane!? Well what is it? \n\n&gt; Well 'Airplane!' was a movie released in 1980 that spoofed disaster films of the time (notably Zero Hour!), and effectively ended the genre for a decade. Airplane! somehow struct gold in its humor and it remains one of the funniest films of all time. Honestly go watch it! And then watch it again! Anyways this isn't important right now, lets get back to the badhistory.\n\nAirplane was released in 1980. However, the movie never mentions what year the events actually take place. To solidify my claim of badhistory, I have to prove that the 'present' timeline in Airplane happened at a certain time. I also have to prove that Airplane doesn't take place in the future. You just never know.\n\nAlright, [let's get ready to face a few facts.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73UfgMoWv8E)\n\n- Smoking was outlawed in the late [1980s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflight_smoking) and the plane clearly supports smoking [tickets](https://youtu.be/0tR4jBtdROE?t=1m12s)\n\n- [Jim has a second cup of coffee on the ground in the 1970s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJ4kCF22O2w) and [in the air](https://youtu.be/ZqtNxNRCcGg?t=2m26s)\n\n- The Co-Pilot is clearly [Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in disguise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar) and it is mentioned that [he played for the LA Lakers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2A194yTWoQ). He played there from 1975-85 and with the movie time line, was there long enough to be criticized.\n\n&gt; Kareen Abdul-Jabbar: \"The hell I don't! LISTEN, KID! I've been hearing that crap ever since I was at UCLA. I'm out there busting my buns every night! Tell your old man to drag Walton and Lanier up and down the court for 48 minutes!\"\n\n- He was talking about Bob Lanier and Bill Walton, both players who played NBA. I want to say that the criticism of Kareem's Play style was after this [horrific game](http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/197901250DET.html) in January 1979.\n\n- The [Boy's life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlySbozGCCk) is kinda similar to the boys life [1977 April edition](http://boyslife.org/wayback/)\n \n- Gatorade has the [logo](http://logos.wikia.com/wiki/Gatorade) and [bottle](http://packagingpedia.wikia.com/wiki/Gatorade) in the [drinking scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl4plPGRG8o) are from 1975-1985.\n\n- There is an appearance by [Ethel Merman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethel_Merman), who died in 1984\n\n- **The [Nuns' Life](http://i.imgur.com/gTjK5S8.jpg) IS DATED for June 1979**\n\n- The movie Airplane! was released in 1980. It makes sense that the plot would take place during or before 1980. Why? [Cause I say so.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmA7Nm4qvGE)\n\nSo using the above, I hope I proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Airplane took place from 1979-1980. If you are starting to get overwhelmed, please [calm down.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvPugcb7QGE)\n\n\n**NOW FOR THE BADHISTORY**\n\nIn Airplane!, there is a famous [Disco Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WXVaChA3Q0) where our main character meets his future girlfriend after her dance partern is murdered. Now, Watch that scene. Notice anything off?\n\nThe song playing from the record player is [\"Staying Alive\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_izvAbhExY), a single by Bee Gees. And here is the kicker. **It was released in December 1977**. Now if we cross reference that with the Main Characters reply after [this joke (it gets cut off)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wxp-NxJny8&amp;list=PLD0A500A27EEA320A). \n\n&gt; \"Besides I haven't touched any kind of plane in **6 years.**\" 50:10\n\n**So, the present timeline takes place 6 years AFTER the war**.\n\nSo to put it into a timeline:\n\n\nEvent | Time\n:--|:--\n\"Staying Alive\" Is released, Main Character is at Bar where it is played | December 1977\nMain Character flies final [failed mission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmTxWuvj__8) | ?\nMain Character is in a hospital | ?\nMain Character enlists for one bout in the Peace Corps | /u/Quouar has said that this may be around 2 and a half years!\nMain Character holds many jobs in three different cities | ?\nMain Character boards the fateful airplane, Nun's Life dated at June 1979 | 1979/1980. **NOT 6 years after 1977**\n\nThis movie would only be historically correct if the present story-line took place in 1983! But it doesn't! \"Staying Alive\" should **Not** have been playing in the bar scene. Its an anachronism! This timeline pushes Airplane! out of the realm of factual, and into the territory of /r/Badhistory. \n\n\n**tl;dr**A song plays in Airplane before the song was released according to Airplane's own timeline.

        "text": "I've finally worked up the courage to examine some BH in my AP World textbook. That's not to say I don't consider this a decent book; it's the best history textbook I've ever had, and the class is the best as well. It's done a good job in showing truly global history instead of just the West, and I've learned a lot about states and peoples that I would otherwise never have heard of. It does have its faults, though, such as in its criminal failure to tell about the accomplishments of Justininan's wife Theodora.\n\nHere is what the book has to say of Theodora. It's very brief, which is disappointing:\n\n&gt;The emperor was also influenced by his wife Theodora, a courtesan connected with Constantinople's horse-racing world, eager for power. Theodora stiffened Justinian's resolve in response to popular unrest and pushed the plans for expansion.\n\n\nAnd that's it. Just a power-hungry, assertive courtesan.  Now let's see what the Encyclopedia Britannica editors have to say about her:\n\n&gt;Attracted by [Theodora's] beauty and intelligence, [Justinian] made her his mistress and married her in 525...Theodora exercised considerable influence, and though she was never co-regent, her superior intelligence and deft handling of political affairs caused many to think that it was she, not Justinian, who ruled Byzantium. Her name is mentioned in nearly all the laws passed during that period. She received foreign envoys and corresponded with foreign rulers, functions usually reserved for the emperor...Theodora is remembered as one of the first rulers to recognize the rights of women, passing strict laws to prohibit the traffic in young girls and altering the divorce laws to give greater benefits to women.\n\n\nWell. Now I'm wondering why they didn't put that part in. They just ignored a huge figure in Byzantine/Roman history, possibly the most powerful woman in the empire's long history. Also, where did they get the horse-racing bit from? I don't think convincing the emperor to weather out the Nika riots really counts.\n\nAnyway, I hope to maybe do some more on the Mongols or something else when I have the time and it's not 11PM.\n\nEDIT: book is World Civilizations: The Global Experience, AP Fourth Edition, by Peter N. Stearns, Michael Adas, Stuart B. Schwartz, and Marc Iason (Jason?) Gilbert.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4jgpqu/in_which_a_trump_supporter_mangles_so_much/",
        "text": "[Here, we can see /r/AskTrumpSupporters try and figure out when America was its greatest and how Trump will help us return to those times of greatness.](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/4jbz9t/what_time_period_or_era_was_america_great/d35erc7) Now, I don't want to seem like I think all Trump supporters support badhistory, but I think it's fair to say that a lot of them do not especially care all that much about how true some of Trump's Trumpisms actually are. The top reply to the question of when America was its greatest is, to say the least, interesting...\n\n&gt;I really love talking about American history. Personally, I believe we've been great since July 4th, 1776, when we made a commitment to the great experiment in liberty. Obviously each era has had its issues (slavery, limited suffrage across every identity, racial tensions and discrimination, economic woes, famine), but each era has had its great successes as well. I'd say even in the height of the depression we were great, because out of that fire came the greatest generation. I can still acknowledge the horrors and atrocities my ancestors commuted while still saying \"those were great men and great times.\" I don't look at great as perfect, but as strong, exemplary, and striving to improve, which America has been at every point in its history.\n\nFrankly, there's not much to say here except that is sounds like a parody of my grandpa's perspective on America's past over the last 100 years. I know I can't say much about contemporary politics so judge this analysis as you will. I'm just gonna move on. \n\n&gt;Trump is on record saying that he believes the times America was greatest was when my boy Teddy was in office, and after WWII and through the 50's. To quote him \"we were stong, we were respected, we had just won a war.\" In many ways those exemplify his campaign and the issues facing our country. We're not strong anymore. our infrastructure, once the best in the world, is crumbling. Our foreign policy has been a mess. We're mocked across the globe. While the sun never sets on American influence, other countries are trying to take the mantle from us as the leader of the free world. Trump is all about making us stronger and helping lead the world towards peace and stability. He's the only candidate so far to have based his entire foreign policy around putting American interests first. He's going to being back jobs, fix our unfair trade deals, stop ISIS, and promote stability and peace over nation building.\n\nSame thing as before. Judge this expression of Trumpism however you want to, I'm just gonna move on. The next paragraph is where the juice is, anyway. \n\n&gt;That's part of why the 1800's are my favorite era to study in American history. It's the only time in our relatively short history where we weren't concerned with the outside world. Seriously, our biggest foreign policy accomplishments during the time were A) not losing the war of 1812, and b) establishing the \"fuck off Europe\" policy, better known as the Monroe doctrine.\n\nUhhh, Idk if he has done as much studying as he thinks he has. The Monroe Doctrine is not expressly isolationist. Rather, it stated that any intervention by European powers in the western hemisphere would be rebuffed by America. The implications of this policy and its extent were and still are hotly debated, but the events that followed its declaration in 1823 certainly do not point to an era of exclusively \"Fuck off Europe\". Sure, there were incidents like the Oregon controversy and the Spanish American war, but the America still sought to interact with European powers. And the simplistic \"Fuck off Europe\" perspective completely ignores American foreign relations with other Western Hemisphere nations which at that time were emerging from colonial rule. Among the blockades and filibustering missions, America wasn't totally ignoring everything going on around it during the 19th and early 20th century. \n\nThis poster's perspective also ignores American relations with other powers that would eventually be incorporated into modern day America, including Mexico and Indian tribes. Looks like this guy doesn't actually study 19th century American foreign policy very much.\n \n&gt;We were focused on ending slavery, keeping the union together, dealing with the market revolution, improving ourselves intellectually and morally, and expanding west to achieve our manifest destiny. \n\nThis is just plain historical whitewashing. There was not a whole lot of focus on ending slavery on account of the gag rule in Congress, pervasive censorship of Abolitionism in the South, and the various attempts at compromise in Congress on the eve of the Civil War that would've perpetuated slavery in some way. The market revolution comment is fair I guess, but that's pretty ambiguous anyway. Same with developing intellectually and \"morally\" (whatever that means...), but they’re also pretty general. If anything, this statement just ignores American political development and the vast struggle and conflict that led to the economic, social, and political advances in America. \n\nAlso, I gotta address the phrasing of the Manifest Destiny bit. \"Expanding west to *achieve our* manifest destiny\". The way he states it implies American expansion was an inevitable consequence of American presence in North America simply by virtue of our collective exceptionality. I know this is more a matter of ideology rather than history, but I think it's important to point out that buying into American exceptionalism creates a tendency to be less rigorous when examining American history. Buying into exceptionalism isn't intrinsically wrong for historians. However, in practice, it oftentimes leads to less critical thinking. Now, moving on:\n\n\n&gt;Yes, we did terrible things, and many of the good things we did were for terrible reasons. We had the bloodiest war in American history. The only reason abolition got through was so white male workers didn't have to compete with slave labor. Not to mention our less than stellar scientific output at the time, the rampant political corruption of the gilded era, virtually non existent womens rights, effectively invading and stealing north west mexico, and the failure of the north to rebuild the south. But for the only time in our history we weren't concerned with what the rest of the world would do or think. \n\nWhat? there's too much in here for one /r/badhistory post and I don't think all this even deserves addressing since it's way too incoherent to actually address. But just running down a few things:\n\n* Lotso people would disagree that abolition only got through *because* white men were tired of competing with black slave labor. It's not like the industries that southern slave labor participated in (read: cash crop farming) competed with white men in the Union. The economies actually evolved to complement each other such that Southern crops fueled industrial development in the Union. If anything, abolition increased competition between blacks and whites. There's way more that can be said about this but I think that the Civil War is pretty well-trodden ground in /r/badhistory \n\n* I'm no expert on the economic and scientific innovation of America at any time, especially before the Civil War, but I'm pretty sure that America did produce some pretty significant inventions like the ~~steamship, telegraph~~, and major improvement to and investment in the railroad. \n\n* Now, the rights of females were severely restricted in America for a long time. That's deffo true. But female literacy in America was far higher than any other nation worldwide (I can't find my copy of *What Hath God Wrought?* but I know Howe gives specific numbers somewhere in there).Though America wasn't universally ahead of the curve in regards to female rights, the development of female equality was greater than other developed countries, especially with respect to education and enfranchisement (in the West, at least). \n\n* The mention of political corruption in the Gilded Age doesn't really make sense in context and comes outta nowhere. Also, it's worth pointing out that corruption was present in many other parts of American history. The Gilded Age has just been mythologized and people therefore think of the late 19th century when corruption comes up. For some reason, neither James Buchanan nor Warren G. Harding cultivated the same legendary aura...\n\n* That last bit is kinda ridiculous imo. At least in my view, America has always been self-conscious of its status as the great democratic experiment and while it may not have always explicitly figured into the development of American society, the country's zealous exaltation of democratic values definitely smacks of caring how others perceive the nation. \n\nThe poster continues...\n\n&gt;We were focused on being the best America we could be, whatever that meant. the romantics and transcendentalist movements, the foundations of proper first wave feminism, the second great awakening , Lincoln, Mark Twain, proper unification, railroads, amendments 13-15, are all great things we ought to celebrate. I hope we can return to that point some day, just being focused on being the best America possible. I don't want our leadership in the world to end, but I want America to come first, and I think Trump is the best man for that.\n\nAgain, what? This just seems like he got into his old APUSH flashcards and wrote down a bunch of the things that sound good. I just don't get how the Second Great Awakening is evidence of America's former greatness. And citing the post-war Amendments ignores the development of Jim Crow and the regression of race relations after the Civil War. (What's weird about vaunting these Amendments while ignoring their practical application is that he previously addresses the \"terrible things\" and good things done for \"terrible reasons\" America did, which seems to at least partially imply the perpetuation of racial inequality well into the 20th century. So he whitewashes the American racial history but also says that we did some bad things but also some good things? It just doesn't make sense) \n\nThat last mention there of wanting America to come first is weird as well because the poster believes America was greatest pre-WWI because America came first back then. But even after that, when America became the superpower we know today after WWII, the US still acted in its own interests. American administrations just went about acting on behalf of American interests in a different way.\n\nThe post ends with a simple apology for the rambling post, so at least the poster is aware of its less than perfect explanation of when America was great. But an apology doesn't really excuse the bizarre romanticizing of the American past. If anything, this post is indicative of the state of American historical knowledge on Reddit which, as most of us here probably know, is pretty poor. \n\nP.S. There's a pretty funny exchange between a NIMBLE NAVIGATOR and someone who's not as high on Trump here.

        "text": "Dead or Alive, You're Coyolxauhqui!\n=\n\n\nNational Geographic's **The Aztecs** is your typical documentary of the type we've come to know and love here on /r/BadHistory\n\n*CRASH ZOOM*, *CYMBAL CRASH*, *REENACTOR FLAILING WITH RUBBER SWORD*, ***The most OVERPRODUCED educational films ON THE PLANET***; *Reality TV generic 'drama' music*.\n\nIts lessons are alternately narrated by some dude in a booth and Peter Weller (of Robocop and The Dark Knight Returns fame and, as I have only just found out, also an art historian) standing somewhere on some unexplained ruin. There's some neat visuals, an overly energetic simulation of an aqueduct, and constant hyperbole, sloppy wording, and episodes of interchangeably showing pictures of Teotihuacan or Tenochtitlán when talking about the other. \n\nBut here comes the part that, to quote these documentaries, ...**shocked the world to its** ***CORE***\n\n[The segment in question](https://youtu.be/1yEvUj-yr2E?t=1489)\n\nAnonymous Narrator Dude describes the famous discovery of the massive stone disc depicting the dismembering goddess Coyolxauhqui by an unrelated excavation in 1978. But who was Coyolxauhqui, and what is her significance? We must now put our naive, trusting hearts in Peter Weller's hands.\n\n&gt; Coyolxauhqui was the moon goddess. But her brother murdered her because she became pregnant in a very...shameful way. Now the Aztecs weren't prudes by any means ... but adultery was a no-no and severely punished often by death.\nSo according to legend the Moon Goddess' brother cut her head off and after he'd decapitated her he shoved her body down a hill. \n\nThe narrator then picks up and immediately moves on to talking about sacrifices.\n\nBut hold on now, we're not interested in that. We're interested in Peter Weller somehow butchering the story of Coyolxauhqui to such a degree that even the Aztecs, infamous heart-plucking blood-maniacs that they are, would wince and think \"dude, that's a bit OTT\".\n\n**R5** - So according to Peter Weller, Coyolxauhqui somehow became pregnant. This angered her brother, curiously unnamed here, who beheaded her. The end. \n\nThe [actual story of Coyolxauhqui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyolxauhqui) isn't really the story of Coyolxauhqui at all, but the story of her (half-)brother, Huitzilopochtli, patron god of the Mexica (the Aztecs), of war, of fire, and of various other things. One of the central characters of the Aztec pantheon, Huitzilopochtli literally translates to \"Left-handed Hummingbird\" or \"Southern Hummingbird\", as the Aztec origin myth tells that Huiztilopochtli appeared before them and guided them *south* to their new homeland. He is also the reason the Aztecs required so many sacrifices, as it fuelled his capacity to war against his enemies. Who were his enemies? Well, let's get into the narrative of the story of Coyolxauhqui.\n\nCoyolxauhqui was the only daughter of the Mother Goddess Coatlicue (whose name means 'serpent-skirt'). She also had four hundred younger brothers. One day however, mother Coatlicue was sweeping a temple when a ball of feathers - some say specifically Hummingbird feathers - fell on her. Somehow, perhaps the feathers phased through her skin into her womb or something, Coatlicue instantly fell pregnant. \n\nYeah, Coyolxauhqui never got pregnant. Her mum did. \n\nCoyolxauhqui and her 400 brothers were *incensed*. They attacked their mother and killed her. [As she died out of her womb leapt Huiztilopochtli fully grown, armed, and armoured](http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/aztecs/huitzilopotchli-birth-iii-f-3v.jpg)\n\nTo put it bluntly, Huitzilopochtli, hero-god of the (reformed) Aztec religion, warrior-angel of that martial race, began to [*utterly wreck shit Nahua-style*](https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/cc0858043f003a3d842f1cc2cb564a95483151c7.jpg).\n\nHuitzilopochtli slew many of his 400 brothers, chasing the rest into the sky where they became stars, and decapitated his elder sister Coyolxauhqui with his awesome lance/javelin **Xiuhcoatl**, in its own right an aspect of the fire-god, but in this context a writhing, serpentine dart of *pure fire and thunder*. God I love the Aztecs.\n\nAnyway, Huitzilopochtli then threw Coyolxauhqui off a mountain and she fell into a heap on the floor, [whence the famous carving (with its original colouring)](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8444/7751677366_826cab8c55_b.jpg) \n\nSummary\n=\nThe team who worked on this segment of The Aztecs somehow managed to get *all* the correct details about the story - someone falling pregnant in a mysterious and embarrassing scandal, the moon goddess being slain by her (half)brother, someone's head being thrown off a mountain, etc. - and yet managed to hilariously and awkwardly work the vital elements of this foundational myth into some kind of madlibs situation where they were put in entirely the wrong order.\n\nSource: *An Illustrated Dictionary of The Gods and Syllables of Ancient Mexico and the Maya*, by Mary Miller and Karl Taube\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Hello Bad Historiers! Life has been busy for me. I have helped research and set up an exhibition at the state Museum. The biography I wrote about one of the individuals involved in the exhibition has been published online and in the catalogue, and I am also credited in the catalogue has a historian and researcher. I am also moving to another state in a week and a half to take up a role as an archivist. \n\nHowever, since I recently finished a game called Dead State, I have had some free time and so I thought it appropriate to review another documentary. Today I am going to focus on another episode of my 'beloved' Conquest series, hosted by the ever 'educational' Peter Woodward. The episode in question is called The Broadsword:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6faFct-woU&amp;list=PLcMNaTUIX_mYapNMjajR9SJrJ-u6fSLTn\n\nI have a bottle of Teacher's Highland Whiskey ready! I shall also attempt to be more academic in my reviews from now on and include actual references. Please note that I am not really going to devote any time to terminology (broad-sword versus arming sword) as that is a whole essay in and of itself. So onwards we march!\n\n0.24: The host states that the broadsword was the primary weapon of knights in the middle ages. Absolutely not. To begin with, the middle ages included a very large span of time, and the weapons used by knights varied, but for the most part the most main weapon was the spear or lance, as knights principally functioned as cavalry (Hall, p 12). DRINK!\n\n0.37: The host claims the broadsword was the king of weapons. Now, I admit I am not that familiar with the current succession issues relating to manufactured weapons, but the sword was hardly ever the 'king'. In the early medieval period the most dominant weapon was the spear (Halsall, p 164). It was equally effective in both single and mass combat, was cheaper to manufacture than a sword and, depending on the blade, could be used for both slashing and stabbing (Halsall, p 164). From the 13th century onwards the spear was still dominant, but had evolved into the late-European pike and a variety of pole-arms (Hall, p 36). DRINK!\n\n1.04: The host calls the broad-sword was the classic weapon of the West. My previous comments above make it clear that this is in correct, but broad-swords (one-handed blades that can cut and slash) were also widely used in Asia, the Middle-East and Africa  (Withers, p 82 and 86). DRINK!\n\n1.08: The documentary includes a slide mentioning that Peter Woodward is a weapons historian. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA *inhale* HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\n\n1.13: The host explains that, in the right-hands, the broad-sword could change history. BAD DETERMINISM! DRINK!\n\n1.16: The host states he has used ancient weapons professionally for twenty years. I would love to see the job description for such an occupation, and the insurance rates.\n\n1.25: The host claims no man could consider themselves a warrior unless they had learnt to use the weapon in attack and defence. Which culture and time period he is referring to? The Spartans maintained a warrior culture, and their primary weapon was the spear (Matthew, p 153). DRINK!\n\n1.38: The host wants his minions to use the broad-sword against one another whilst wearing plate armour, full-contact. Make sure the weapons are sharp and that is a show from the History Channel I would not mind watching. \n\n2.00: The host states that early iron and bronze swords were of poor quality and often broke or bent. Most likely he is referring to references in Roman sources to Celtic swords bending and needing to be straightened. Such references are generally thought to refer to the act of \"sacrificing\" blades. In reality, many iron and bronze swords were of high quality, as discussed here:\n\nhttp://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/iss/kap_b/backbone/rb_2_2.html\n\nDRINK!\n\n2.05: The host claims the Romans and Greek preferred the short-sword. He expertly demonstrates this by picking up a weapon almost as long as the broad-sword. DRINK!\n\n2.20: The host states Roman officers used the spatha as they did not have heavy shields to protect themselves. Which officers? Centurions used both the gladius/xiphos themselves (James, p 33). DRINK!\n\n2.28:The host explains the spatha was not very strong. GAH! See the previous link about Celtic metallurgy, which the Romans were influenced by. DRINK!\n\n2.41: Mention of the Dark Ages! GAH! GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! DRINK!\n\n3.02: The host states the earliest warriors to use the broad-sword were the Vikings. Uh, no. The Viking sword, like Saxon and Frankish blades, were descended from migration-era weapons, so it would be far more accurate to say the early *Germanic* peoples were the first to use it (James, p 275). DRINK!\n\n3.41: The host claims that early broadswords were poorly balanced. Much like his knowledge of actual history. There was no one \"ideal\" form of blade balance. It all depended on the design. For example, some blades like the falcata were intended to be used in a chopping manner (Withers, p 18). This would have meant the balance was well forward,  resulting in a heavier and deadlier strike. DRINK!\n\n3.50: HOLLYWOOD SWORD TWIRLING PRESENTED AS PROPER COMBAT TECHNIQUES! DRINK!\n\n3.55: The host calls Viking swords primitive slashing weapons. Viking swords were *incredibly* well made blades, using an advanced manufacturing method called pattern welding (Halsall, p 164). DRINK!\n\n4.05: The host states Viking swords were too heavy and awkward for defence. *Really*? This video by Thegn Thrand shows how agile Viking swords could be:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9C8SeMzpfU\n\n4.09: Host again explains the steel of Viking sword was of poor quality. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! DRINK!\n\n4.37: BAD DEPICTION OF MEDIEVAL COMBAT! DRINK!\n\n4.54: The host explains in the early medieval period it was strength, not skill, that won the day. That's why the Saxons, Vikings and Franks won all their battles by charging madly and never using formations like the shield-wall and boar's head that require coordination and training. What, what? DRINK!\n\n5.01: The host  believes axes were used until technology tipped the balance and they lost out to swords. Nope. Axes were still widely used, such as by the Byzantine Varangian Guard well into the 12th century (Birkenmeier, p 96), and were common in the form of halberds and pole-axes in the Renaissance era (Hall, p 36). DRINK!\n\n5.26: The host states the peasant classes were forbidden to use swords of any kind. Which region? Which time period? Which culture? DRINK!\n\n5.36: The host says the lower-classes were no match for professional swordsmen. I wonder if French knights thought the same thing whilst getting massacred at Courtai in 1302 (Hall,\n p 34)\n\n6.20: The host claims the gambeson was very heavy and stiff to wear. I actually own a replica gambeson and I can personally attest that it is light, flexible and comfortable. DRINK!\n\n7.28: DEMONSTRATION USING OBVIOUSLY BLUNT WEAPON! DRINK!\n\n7.47: A thrust could only pierce maille under certain conditions, like when it was hung on a stand rather than being worn over a gambeson by a squishy human. DRINK!\n\n\n8.13: Maille is clearly butted, not riveted. DRINK!\n\n8.30: Host asserts that a strong sword blow would crush a helmet and the head beneath it. The problem is the helmet is clearly dented, not crushed, and the portion that was dented was the top half, which would stun the wearer but most likely not result in skull fracture. DRINK!\n\n8.47: Another claim that there is only one proper type of sword balance. DRINK!\n\n9.07: Host describes sword with sharp, tapering point as being used mostly for cutting. DRINK!\n\n9.28: Yet another reference to \"ideal\" blade balance. DRINK!\n\n9.41: An Englishman uses the Italian grip. CULTURAL APPROPRIATION! TRIGGERED!\n\n10.49: I don't think medieval knights just sat on horses and tapped their swords against each other. DRINK!\n\n11.30: HOLLYWOOD COMBAT SPIN! DRINK!\n\n12.12: OH FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS CAPITALIST! The host states that a soldier would dual-wield a sword and dagger in battle. THIS NEVER EVER HAPPENED! Sword and dagger were for duelling, not battle. A warrior who willingly abandoned his shield for a dagger would so mentally deranged they could be a staff writer for *Arrow*. George Silver, in Paradoxes of Defence (1599), writes \n\n&gt;Yet understand, that in battles, and where variety of weapons are, among multitudes of men and horses, the sword and target, the two handed sword, battle axe, the black bill, and halberd, are better weapons, and more dangerous in their offense and forces, than is the sword and buckler, short staff, long staff, or forest bill. The sword and target leads upon shot, and in troops defends thrusts and blows given by battle axe, halberds, black bill, or two handed swords, far better than can the sword and buckler.\n\nNote how he leaves out two swords, or sword and dagger, in a battle setting. Compare this to what he said in an earlier entry:\n\n\n\n&gt;The short staff or half pike, forest bill, partisan, or glaive, or such like weapons of perfect length, have the advantage against the battle axe, the halberd, the black bill, the two handed sword, the sword and target, and are too hard for two swords and daggers, or two rapier and poniards with gauntlets, and for the long staff and morris pike.\n\nNo mention of battle at all, so this must describe duelling, not mass combat.

        "text": "So, here's this TIL thread about how fried chicken was originally introduced to the south via Scottish immigrants. The top comment to begin with gives us an idea of what we're in for. \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/4ifndg/tilthe_scots_had_a_tradition_of_deep_frying/\n\n&gt; Black slaves appropriated Scottish culture, how insensitive of them.\n\nWell, ok then, hilarious, aren't you funny and original. Well, let's go deeper.\nThroughout this thread, there's a recurring statement that most (or as one special person claims, all) of black American culture comes from the Scots. Well, then that's a bold claim! Who's your source for that? Let's use the top comment on this matter, at 139 points and right below the first comment.\n\n&gt;Actually, all of what many people consider black or ghetto culture is directly from the Scottish, who immigrated and worked as slavemasters in the south. See the book \"Black Rednecks and White Liberals\" by Thomas Sowell I didn't believe it until I watched a Scottish sitcom about lower income Scotts. The values, attitudes, language, everything, is practically verbatim. So much slang is exactly the same.\n\nAh. I see. Thomas Sowell. _Ah_. This is perhaps skirting along the lines of the 20-year rule, but to say Thomas Sowell is a controversial academic would be understating it, to say the least. But, I'm already skirting the 20-year rule, so I'll leave it at that for now. Maybe I'll elaborate further on that particular facet later. Anyhow, his claim that\n\n&gt;The values, attitudes, language, everything, is practically verbatim. So much slang is exactly the same.\n\nThat's laughable. I would go through an itemized breakdown of where they go wrong here, but I would be typing until my hands were gnarled little things glued to a keyboard. Even if Scottish culture played a role in some aspects of black American culture in the late 1700s early 1800s, the amount of time, cultural difference, and the difference in situation between the two groups makes this a ridiculous claim. But hey, they saw a sitcom about lower income Scots (or as they think, Scotts...) so there ya go!\n\nMan, in hindsight, expecting Reddit to not be somewhat gross on an article about fried chicken was a little too much to expect.\n\nEDIT: So, Thomas Sowell is a public academic widely lauded on the right wing/libertarian side of things for bringing a new perspective on race issues. He's also black, which in many conservative viewpoints help legitimize his views on racial issues. He was also one of the leading proponents of Robert Bork when he was nominated to the supreme court. I'm personally not a fan, a quote from Bernadette Chachere about one of his more well-known works, _Markets, and Minorities_\n\n&gt; \"To cite one article published in 1973, after controlling for age, region of residence, parents' income, father's occupation and education, place where raised, number of siblings, health, local labor, market conditions, geographic mobility, and seasonal employment, there still remained a 70% difference in the earnings of whites and nonwhites unexplained....the lack of such a [literature] review does preclude Sowell's claim to a monopoly on 'rigorous' analysis. Sowell is walking on severely trampled terrain as if it were virgin territory. There is not one footnote to this chapter.\n\n\n\nEDIT TWO: \n\nHere's some more in-depth R5, partially drawn from a comment I made further down the thread, because I'm a miscreant.\nIt's somewhat difficult to sum this up succinctly, both by the fact of the ridiculousness of the claim, as well as the breadth of the claim. To just use music as an example, while there is obviously a mix of African and Scots-Irish influences in things like bluegrass and country, these are hybrid genres to begin with, and are not primarily associated with black American culture, and have not for a while. Things like jazz, funk, soul, and rap, while syncretic at times in their influences, do not have a primarily Scots-Irish background, and certainly do not have much in common with modern Scottish culture (unless you count the American popular music influence in Scotland as being Scottish, but that would be somewhat silly now, wouldn't it?)\n\nWhile I won't deny that Scottish and Irish people had a huge role in developing the culture of what we think is now southern, to attribute sole responsibility and credit to them, as this poster does, removes the huge role that blacks, and by that virtue various African cultures (predominantly West African I believe) played in this development. That's even without getting into to the role that native Americans played in forming a part of what we consider black and southern culture (i.e., succotash, Hopping John to a lesser extent).\nRegarding class values, I think he's conflating socioeconomic status with race and cultural background. People of poorer socioeconomic status in developed countries are going to have some things in common across the spectrum. What's particularly icky about this one, though, is that the post makes the direct connection as lower-class culture= black culture, which is insulting. Not to mention that his source for this is a fucking TV sitcom. I don't know much about linguistics, but I find it highly doubtful that AAEV has much in common with Scottish slang, other than it evolving contemporarily.\n\nLastly, if they just said that some of black American culture was influenced by Scots-Irish culture, they'd probably be in the clear, because that is mostly true. However, saying _all_ black American culture was directly a result of the Scots, without any regard to existing African traditions is absurd and ridiculous at face value. Or to make this even shorter, the Gullah language exists, Gullah is not Scottish, Gullah is part of african american cultural heritage, therefore, not all african american culture is Scottish. Repeat ad nauseum.\n",

        "author": "Astrokiwi",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4ijz43/bad_history_in_marvels_civil_war_frontline_comic/",
        "text": "Okay, so bad history in comic books is maybe low hanging fruit, but these section is actually portrayed as history - it quotes Plutarch! - so I think it's fair game.\n\nDuring the Civil War event in the comics (10 years ago!), there were a lot of tie-in series, such as *Frontline*, following Ben Urich and his \"Frontline\" newspaper as they covered the event. At the end of some of these issues, there are a few pages that compare Marvel's Civil War to various conflicts in the past. This is a bit silly and maybe even tasteless, but hardly the worst thing to come out of comics, or out of Civil War in particular. But there's some delicious bad history here to tear apart.\n\n[Here](http://i.imgur.com/oIiywsV.jpg) is today's page. The text at the top is where the bad history is most concentrated.\n\nLet's go! (I've super-truncated the quotes just to give the general idea)\n\n&gt;By 59 BC... Julius Caesar [was a] veteran of numerous successful campaigns... throughout Northern Europe\n\n\"Northern Europe\" of course referring to Spain, and his youthful adventures in the Near East.\n\n&gt; Caesar shared the Consulate position with two men: Pompey... and ... Crassus\n\nThe triumvirate wasn't based on all three men being consuls at the same time! Caesar's consul-mate was Marcus Bibulus. Pompey and Crassus had already been consuls, and would become consuls again, but never all three at the same time. The triumvirate was a more of an informal power-bloc - they weren't formally recognised as three simultaneous consuls, even if in practice their practical power often exceeded the formal powers of the actual consuls.\n\n&gt;Despite Caesar's obvious benefit to Rome, his moves were often blocked by a corrupt Roman Senate\n\nAt this point Caesar has just finished his Gallic campaigns, which were technically under his proconsulship - a position that was really only supposed to last for one year. Although it's not unfair to call the Roman Senate corrupt, it's not like Julius Caesar was any better. He may have been a good populist leader, bringing success in military campaigns, and even some level of reform for the lower classes. But overall, he was as happy to bribe and break the rules as much as anyone.\n\n&gt;To Caesar [disbanding his legions] was an illegal act: his consulship was perfectly legitimate\n\nTechnically this could be true - *to Caesar*, he may have thought that his consulship was legitimate, but the senators did have a pretty good case for this not being true. They were, arguably, trying to prevent a power bloc from transforming Rome into a de-facto dictatorship, in addition to fighting for their own personal interests.\n\nThe text in the actual comic panels is all an extended quote from Plutarch, so that's okay. But there's one quote at the bottom of this page that we can nitpick:\n\n&gt;The senators are demanding he give up his consulship\n\nHe wasn't a consul, he was a proconsul! The words are similar, but they are very different positions.\n\nThen in the next couple of pages (not included here), we see the legions fight a battle while forcing their way across the Rubicon. This is, of course, complete fiction. \n\nThere are other things you could pick apart in this comic, but I wanted to point out a few of the bigger errors. These errors combine to make Julius Caesar into a Freedom Fighter, and even if you could find a lot to admire about Caesar, his dedication to moral rectitude and stamping out corruption is not one of them.\n\n----\n\nThere are plenty more of these in other issues that I could go through if people are interested.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4iiws0/a_review_of_nbcs_peter_the_great_part_one_of_part/",
        "text": "So I've been going through my copy of Robert Massie's exquisite biography of Peter Alexeyevich, titled 'The Great' and probably my favorite historical figure this side of BC/AD. And in doing so I noticed that it had been adapted into a miniseries by NBC back in the days when channels apparently did epic miniseries of historical figures and events that didn't try and filter it through modern Hollywood. So with nothing to do on one of my nights off, I decided to crack open some cider -though I'm pretty sure it's just fruit juice and vodka- and pop on [part one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVBHi70OluE)\n\n\nFirst off I'd like to give pretty big props to NBC's costuming department. While I'm not an expert on late 17th century Russian apparel, I know something and from what I've seen so far it looks pretty decent. Compare the clothing that a young Peter is wearing [here](http://puu.sh/oLrJS/4536ca6d1b.jpg) for example with the corresponding scene [here.](http://puu.sh/oLrWO/4220acd58e.jpg) Likewise the [Streltsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streltsy#/media/File:Streltsi.jpg) look pretty [damn](http://puu.sh/oLs7K/0a33fd31e4.jpg) good in all their VHS-era glory. \n\n\nNow the show starts up almost right away about the 1682 Streltsy Uprising, in which Sofia Alekseyevna spread rumors that the regent Natalya Naryshkina had murdered the Tsarervich and were trying to take control, prompting a frenzied revolt of murky loyalty by the Streltsy (Strelet = 'to shoot') regiment inside Moscow. We quickly get to the action and watch the revolting Streltsy engage in a battle with the Stremyani Regiment of streltsy defending the Kremlin, overwhelming and killing them before going to 'save' the royal family. Except for there was no action, the Stremyani soldiers were swept up in the excitement and joined their comrades in taking over the kremlin.\n\n\nWe also see [these two](http://puu.sh/oLsf8/be372a1c3c.jpg) motherfuckers ambling around and looting dead streltsy, and I have no idea who they're supposed to be. They're beardless, so either the only two beardless Russians in the empire, or they're foreigners. Though they're dress is nothing spectacular, definitely not what a visiting dignitary would wear, and I'm hard pressed to think what other foreigners were puttering around the Kremlin at the time.\n\n\nAnd here we see a streltsy armed with a [bolt-action magazine-fed flintlock.](http://puu.sh/oLsDr/ec5e0fa1ea.jpg) Might not have wanted that prop in a prominent shot there. He steps into a room and almost kills a hiding Peter and Natalya before being knifed by one of the beardless looters, who doesn't seem to have the 'staying inconspicuous during the bloody rampage' thing nailed down.\n\n\nExcept.. the bloody rampage also doesn't happen. We watch the streltsy break into the Kremlin, fight the palace Stremyani, kill one or two hapless old nobles before being calmed by the Patriarch and Sofia who made a deal that she calm the Streltsy in return for the regency. She shows off Ivan and Peter and the rest of the royal family, the Streltsy are happy, and Sofia becomes regent.\n\n\nBut reality was far bloodier and not only killed most supporters of Natalya, but made Peter extremely hostile towards the streltsy in later life, helping prompt his desire to modernize the Russian army. The streltsy were indeed initially appeased by an old general named Matveev and the Patriarch, and by Natalya showing Peter and Ivan to the mob. This worked, until they left and Matveev's son begin shouting bloody murder at the streltsy for their disobedience. This revived the streltsy's anger, they remembered why they'd come there, and then they rampaged through the kremlin butchering almost everyone they saw.\n\nSo we move on a bit and watch the young Peter as he meets his beardless savior, who turns out to be [Alexander Menshikov.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Danilovich_Menshikov) Now this is entirely wrong for several reasons. One, this Menshikov is shown as ten years older than the young Peter, when he was only born a year later in reality, and  Two, he *doesn't have a goddamn beard and this is Pre-Petrine Russia*. Menshikov's father a soldier under Peter father Alexis II and may have been related to some bottom-rung Lithuanian nobility. Menshikov *was* a stable boy growing up however and spent a lot of his childhood around Peter, understanding the value of proximity to the young boy and volunteering for Peter's play army. He doggedly stuck around and ended up Peter's bestest and corruptest friend. \n\n'I'm taking you into my service with the rank of friend.' *D'awwwwwww*\n\n\nPretty damn impressive coronation ceremony though. But the two thrones are wrong, for the duel-coronation of the co-Tsarship of Ivan and Peter they just put a divider down the middle of the throne.\n\n\n[Grow a beard Menshikov.](http://puu.sh/oLtVx/a560252b95.jpg) Seriously, no true Russian would be caught dead without a beard, literally. After Peter enforced the shaving of beards (unless you paid a beard tax) many Russian men kept their beards on hand so if they died they would still be recognized when they got to heaven. Now Menshikov would hop right on Peter's anti-movember movement when it got going (and before that too) but the idea of any Russian man -especially one now in the court- being clean shaved is utterly inane if they're not foreign.\n\n\nThe scene shifts and the narrator says 'one day in 1692' that the Crimean tatars moved up north and began raiding and burning villages, taking Russians as slaves. True, but it wasn't just 'one day in 1692,' the tatars raided and pillaged more or less around the clock unopposed in Russia, and even sacked Moscow twice before, and the Ottoman slave market was flooded with Russians and Ukrainians. \n\n\nNext the Boyar council and Sofiya are meeting about a campaign against Turkish forts at Azov. But this doesn't make sense because the Azov campaign by Golitsyn was in 1687, not 1692. Also a curious number of these Boyars are lacking in the beard department. Prince Golitsyn here also talks about his plan to have two columns march on Azov when there was only one.\n\n\nAnyway I'm done for now, reviewing a two-hour video is taking longer than I thought. Make this Part One of Part One, and I'll probably finish this later. Or not, in which case I'll deliver an assessment based on what I've seen. Good costume, good sets, decent acting although Sofia looks like a Bond villain with her pet ferret, and it's overall doing an alright job of telling Peter's story, even if it muffs up a lot of details.\n\n\nSources: *Peter the Great: His Life and World* by Robert K. Massie.\n\n\nEdits after further watching and drinking \n\n\n- General Patrick Gordon didn't save Peter from a boating accident and meet him that way, he was known to the Muscovite court and had been a general for Alexis II. \n\n\n- Later they say that Goliytsin was ambushes and lost 45000 men on the Azov campaign (the first I'm presuming) but he never was 'ambushed' in some climatic battle. He was harassed by Tatar cavalry the whole way, losing men to attrition, until the Tatars burned the land around them and they eventually trudged back to Moscow for a loss of food, and never even fought a serious battle. \n\n\nAlso Peter married Eudoxia after the first Azov campaign and after he overthrew Sofia and took power.\n\n\n- C'moooon, Goly's failure wasn't a surprise to anyone and Peter didn't make some grand speech denouncing the twerp. He just refused to acknowledge his victory and gave him a cold shoulder. Everyone knew that Sofias rewarding Golitsyn was total hogwash and helped lead to her loss of power prior to Peter takeover.\n\n\n- [WHERE'S YOUR FLINT BRUH?](http://i.imgur.com/QIKZyjC.jpg) i dunno, but I do know there was no random assassination attempt by what looks like remarkably well armed peasants. I mean they're using flintlocks (except for that one dumbass missing his flint) and those were sort of not really popular until the Petrine military reforms, until then matchlocks were still very common.\n\n\nOkay apparently they were Sofia's soldiers. Lol wut, Sofia didn't do that and wouldn't be so fucking dumb as to attempt to assassinate THE TSAR in such a blatant way. Also Peter remarks that torture is ineffective, implying that in this show he's against torture. Makes me wonder how it'll handle his reaction to the streltsy revolt of 1698 :)\n\n\nBTW these edits more or less finished my review of part one. So, yeah. Invalid title, I guess I'll review part two later or something. Not now, I've drank enough now. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4iib55/you_probably_didnt_find_a_lost_maya_city_the_post/",
        "text": "[This recent post](https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4igqnk/15_year_old_discovers_hidden_mayan_city/) on /r/news is rocketing to the top. The linked paragraph (I hesitate to call it an article) claims a 15 year old boy from Quebec found a new Maya city based on analysis of satellite imagery. Somewhere downthread another user links [a more detailed article in French](http://www.journaldemontreal.com/2016/05/07/un-ado-decouvre-une-cite-maya). I don't speak french, but thankfully google translate is able to help enough that I can get the gist of what's happening.\n\nSo here's the skinny. A young aspiring archaeologist combed through the Codex Madrid (and presumably published literature on the document) to identify Maya constellations. Using GIS, he overlaid the constellations on the Maya landscape and found that the known Classic Maya sites apparently lined up with the constellations. From there, he predicted that another Maya site would be located in Eastern Belize as one of the constellations seemed to have a \"missing\" site. When he combed through satellite imagery, he found architectural mounds where he predicted the site would be.\n\nOn its surface, this is an awesome story. This young man is already diving into Mesoamerican archaeology at an early age. He's learned about Maya astronomy, Maya codices, and has learned the Maya landscape. He's using GIS to interpret satellite imagery, which frankly is something many *college students* struggle with. And even if he's got help with interpreting it (which the French article makes clear he does), that's an amazing accomplishment. In no way should that be under-emphasized. I hope this kid gets a full ride scholarship and goes on to do great research.\n\nOn the other hand, there is *absolutely no way that this is true.* At least not the way the news articles are reporting it. \n\nLets start on the most basic level. What does it mean to \"discover\" an archaeological site? The first step in any archaeological project is survey. This can (and more frequently *does*) involve using remotely sensed imagery like satellite multispectral imagery, synthetic aperture radar, or lidar. More traditionally, it involves getting a bunch of people to walk and/or machete in straight lines along a regular grid and catalog anything they find. Thousands of surveys (both using remote sensing and otherwise) are carried out world wide every year. Pretty much each and every one of them finds new archaeological sites that hadn't been registered before. Of course, local people often knew about these sites beforehand, but often times these sites are not \"known\" by archaeologists or registered in national databases. \n\nTypically, most \"new\" archaeological sites are fairly small. A scatter of artifacts, a few buildings, some half-buried agricultural terraces. This isn't to say that previously unknown archaeological sites of a large scale aren't found on occasion. But typically, the really huge archaeological sites are in areas that haven't been surveyed extensively already, either because they're in areas people have overlooked or in hard-to-reach locations.\n\nIn the case of this article, the purported new city is in eastern/central Belize not far from the coast. There is absolutely no way that a huge city is located there that nobody has ever seen before. It may not be registered in a database that the student in question had access to, or it may not be as large as he thinks it is. The article itself is rather inconsistent on the size of the site. It claims at one point that the site comprises 30 visible architectural mounds (which makes it fairly small to medium size by Mesoamerican standards), and at another point claims it covers 80 to 120 square km (which would make it probably the biggest in the Western Hemisphere). The article also claims that it is the fourth largest in the Maya world (I'm assuming after Tikal, Calakmul, and Caracol).\n\nThere's a joke among Mesoamerican archaeologists. What's the typical nuclear family in Belize? The mother, the father, the children, and the Maya archaeologist staying with them to study the nearby ruins. Of all the regions in Mesoamerica, Belize (especially eastern Belize) is the most heavily studied. This is due to the fact that Belize's official language is English, they're the only country in the area that allows field schools, and the Classic Maya have the sexy alure of the \"lost city in the jungle\" trope that dominates pop archaeology. The odds that a city that big, in that particular area, had escaped study for that long are slim to none.\n\nThe second claim of the article is that this somehow verifies the theory that the Maya landscape is a massive cosmogram where the placement of cities reflects the stars in Maya constellations. Lets think about that for a minute. How are you overlaying constellations on the landscape? How are you defining the orientation of the constellations? How are you measuring distance? The fact is that the Maya lowlands was so densely populated that if you were to take a series of random points and scale and rotate them enough you could probably get it to line up with a pattern of archaeological sites. Hell, you could probably throw a dart at a map of the Peten and you'd probably hit pretty close to an archaeological site.\n\nBut on a deeper level, the idea that city placement corresponds to cosmology on that scale implies a top down plan that we frankly know didn't exist. Maya cities have different origins. Some were occupied going back to the Formative/Preclassic period. Others were founded later. All were ruled by their own political dynasties that did not typically coordinate with each other. The entire Classic Maya civilization was dominated by an elite culture composed of feuding lineages that were constantly seeking to one-up their rivals through warfare and competitive festivals. So while we have lots of evidence for cosmically-informed planning *within* cities, there are few examples of that *between* cities. To suggest that such a cosmic order existed across the entire Maya lowlands would require rejecting mountains of evidence demonstrating the opposite.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I think it's awesome that this kid is doing satellite-based remote sensing surveys at 15. I think it's awesome that he found some ruins through that, regardless of whether anybody already knew about it. But lets not blow this whole thing out of proportion. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4ie4sz/anne_bonny_the_female_pirate_how_a_1960s_fiction/",
        "text": "On many websites online today, you will find entries about Anne Bonny featuring descriptions like this for her early life (this is from the most recent wikipedia entry):         \n          \n&gt;Anne Bonny was born around 1690. Her birth name was Anne McCormac, and her birthplace was Cork, Ireland. She was the daughter of servant woman Mary Brennan and Brennan's employer, lawyer William McCormac.         \n       \nThere are plenty of variations on this, though most spell it \"Cormac\" and push the birth date to the later parts of the 1690s (1698 being pretty common - though lately it seems like I keep on seeing the date getting set back farther in time, making her go into her 20s now for when she became a pirate).  The problem is, there is no historical basis for any of this.  Charles Johnson's *A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates* (1724) is responsible for most of the story involving Anne's early life in Ireland and the colonies (before she arrived in the Bahamas).  No documents have yet to surface to verify this, and based on way Johnson wrote the section and period literary trends, it would take a lot to prove it wasn't fiction.  But, where did the names of the parents and the birth date come from?       \nThe answer: a fiction book from 1964 by John Carlova entitled *Mistress of the Seas*.        \n     \nHow?  The short version of this is that Carlova made claims he did research in his introduction, basically making the book equivalent of films slapping a \"based on a true story\" label when it barely qualifies.  Unfortunately, some historians in the 1980s and 1990s took it for face value and put these things as \"facts\" in their books.  Then the information became three and more times removed from the original source in the 1960s, and assumed to be fact.  Eventually, historian David Cordingly incorporated these \"facts\" into his 2004 entry for Anne Bonny in the *Oxford Dictionary of National Biography*.      \n        \nYes, a piece of information that started as fiction 50 years go is now a fact in an Oxford publication.  This is why you have to be extremely careful about how you use secondary sources.  People kept on passing this information along without checking it. There has yet to be any documents made public regarding this claim that started in a fiction book, though plenty of genealogists have run with it and made some really far reaching claims because of this.  It did not help that the serious pursuit of studying the history behind historical piracy, at least by modern academic standards, was still in its infancy in the late 20th century.  This probably led to the many instances of negligence in scholarship on pirate history in that period.       \n        \nThere is a lot more to this story, and a lot more fiction in the history of Anne Bonny and Mary Read.  If you are interested in finding out more, the second section of my article, [Anne Bonny and Mary Read: Female Pirates and Maritime Women](https://csphistorical.com/2016/05/08/anne-bonny-and-mary-read-female-pirates-and-maritime-women-page-one/) is essentially one large badhistory post.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4ibuw7/how_the_armenian_genocide_was_not_the_first/",
        "text": "(I like to think \"apoplectic\" in this title means the indignant version rather than the enraged version, but they both work.)\n\nThere's a couple of different approaches to take with [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/4h24sg/info_on_ottoman_empire_circa_1900s/d2ozg83), not the least of which is the concept of a \"native Ottoman,\" which is thoroughly problematic in its own right, but I want to start with the idea of \"mass genocide.\" I don't understand this term. I don't understand it in the slightest. Genocide, by definition, is a large event. Murdering your neighbour isn't genocide. Murdering your neighbour and their family isn't genocide. For something to qualify as genocide, it must - per the legal definition of genocide:\n\n&gt; [genocide means any of the following acts\ncommitted with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical,\nracial or religious group, as such :\n(a) Killing members of the group;\n(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;\n(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to\nbring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;\n(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;\n(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\n](https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%2078/volume-78-I-1021-English.pdf)\n\nThat's it. There is no distinction between \"genocide\" and \"mass genocide,\" whatever that term is meant to mean. Every genocide is a large scale event to the group that it is targeting. Every genocide is, by definition, a \"mass genocide\" by virtue of the fact that it's an attempt to wipe out a group of people. \n\nThe argument could be made that \"mass genocide\" is meant to mean a genocide in which millions of people died - with the Holocaust being a prime example of this - but the problem there is that the death toll for the Armenian genocide then wouldn't necessarily fit into that definition. Even some of [the most generous estimates](http://www.armenian-genocide.org/genocidefaq.html#How_many) put the death toll around 1.5 million, which isn't the multi-millions that I think \"mass genocide\" implies. TO BE VERY CLEAR, this is not me disparaging the tragedy that was the Armenian genocide in any way - every genocide is horrific, and none should happen. However, I think it's also very important to keep an eye on the facts. Equally, I'm aware that I'm speculating about the definition of a term that I don't think necessarily has a satisfactory definition. I think it's important, though, to understand what a genocide is before we explore genocides that occurred in the 20th century, but before the Armenian genocide.\n\nCase in point: the [Herero and Namaqua genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herero_and_Namaqua_genocide).\n\nIn 1885, German colonial interest in southwest Africa (primarily what is now Namibia) grew with the arrival of Heinrich Göring (whose son would go on to be infamous [for his own genocidal pursuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_G%C3%B6ring)) as the imperial commissioner of the area. He and the then commander of the German troops in the area, Curt von Francois, concluded that in the face of resistance from Nama leaders such as Hendrik Witbooi, \"nothing but relentless severity will lead to success.\" Their goal, quite simply, was to exterminate the Nama and Herero from German territory. In 1893, for instance, German troops wiped out the Nama town of Hornkranz, killing unarmed women and children in the process. Even after Witbooi's surrender to the Germans in September of 1894, German attacks on the Nama and Herero didn't end, and if anything, grew more brutal. \n\nBy late 1903, German settlers had taken over a quarter of the Hereros' land, subsidised heavily by the German colonial office. By 1904, the Herero were understandably fed up with this series of events, with Herero leader Samuel Maharero writing to other indigenous leaders like Hendrik Witbooi, urging them to rise up against the German invasion. In mid-January of 1904, the Herero began their attack, and while they met with initial success, as you might expect, things did not end well. The German response to the Herero could perhaps best be summed up by the statement from the Colonial Office to the Reichstag that \"Germany's honour demands the repression of the uprising by all means...the swifter and harsher the reprisals taken...the better the chances of restoring authority.\"\n\nAs an aside, the German Colonial Society also said \"Europeans can assert themselves only by maintaining the supremacy of their race at all costs.\" It's not a phrase I want in my search history, but I think it does do a good job of illustrating the general German attitude towards indigenous peoples in Africa, namely \"go away barbarians.\"\n\nEnter Lothar von Trotha, German general and imperialist extraordinaire, whose previous accomplishments included suppressing rebellions in German East Africa as well as fighting in the Boxer Rebellion. His general attitude towards indigenous Africans included \"[no war can be waged humanely against non-humans](https://www.fromthesquare.org/?p=7699#.Vy5V6vkrKUk)\" and \"I shall annihilate the revolting tribes with rivers of blood and rivers of gold. Only after a complete uprooting will something emerge.\" Suffice to say, there was a racial element to von Trotha's actions, as well as a pretty clear intention to wipe out the Herero, which is genocidal. \n\nIt's difficult to assign any one particular date for when a genocide begins, but certainly the Battle of Waterberg on 11-12 August 1904 could be seen as the beginning of Germans acting on their genocidal intent. Most of the remaining Herero - around 60 000 people - had taken refuge in the Waterberg Mountains. German troops surrounded the mountains in preparation for the battle, leaving a possible escape route for any fleeing Hereros - into the Omaheke Desert. As the battle ended and it became clear that a Herero victory was not a possibility, the Herero tried to flee with their herds. 5000 were killed before making it to the desert, with Germans bayoneting and massacring the Herero, regardless of whether they were armed. Indeed, though von Trotha's orders expressly forbade shooting any captured Hereros, there's a lot of speculation about whether or not he intentionally phrased those orders to allow for bayoneting and other forms of murder that were committed against captured Hereros. The remaining Hereros fled into the desert, only to find that the Germans had poisoned the water holes. The Herero died in droves in the desert. Of the approximately 50 000 Herero that fled into the desert, only around 1500 reached British-controlled Bechuanaland. Another 2000 made it to Ovamboland or Namaland. German patrols through the desert would later find skeletons clustered around holes more than forty feet deep that had been dug in desperate attempts to find water in the desert.\n\nOn 2 October, von Trotha turned his attention towards the remaining Herero who had not joined Mahahero's fight, issuing an Extermination Order. Von Trotha promised that \"within the German border, every male Herero, armed or unarmed, with or without cattle, will be shot to death. I shall no longer receive women and children, but will drive them back to their people or have them shot at.\" Two days later, Hendrik Witbooi declared war on the Germans, well aware that the choice facing him was either to fight or be killed in some other unceremonious way. The Nama were crushed, and while they did have some moderate success waging a guerrilla war, by 1907, their leaders were dead, and most of the surviving Nama were imprisoned in concentration camps. The remaining Nama and Herero were used as slave labour, where they continued to be worked to death. By the end of 1907, more than 80 000 Herero, Nama, and Damara (who had, at this point, been caught in the crossfire) had been killed through German genocidal actions.\n\nWere as many Africans killed in the Herero - Nama genocide as Armenians? No, but why that illegitimises this as a genocide, I don't understand. The first genocide of the 20th century began in 1904 in German Southwest Africa, and didn't end until 1907 when between 60 and 75% of indigenous southwest Africans had been wiped out of German territory. It shouldn't be forgotten. \n\nSources!\n\nThe Herero history museum in Windhoek has a really fantastic exhibition on Witbooi, Mahahero, and the toll the genocide took on the peoples living in German Southwest Africa. If you're ever there, I highly recommend paying it a visit. \n\nAs with most of my posts, I referenced the [Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide](https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%2078/volume-78-I-1021-English.pdf) for my definition of genocide. \n\nI also used Ben Kiernan's book \"Blood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur,\" which is an excellent look at genocides throughout world history. \n\nFinally, I also used Alex Bellamy's book \"Massacres and Morality: Mass Atrocities in an Age of Civilian Immunity.\"\n\nAnd, as a final note, [this isn't just forgotten on Reddit,](http://www.wsj.com/articles/pope-francis-calls-armenian-slaughter-first-genocide-of-20th-century-1428824472) which could be the most heart-breaking part of all.",

        "text": "Welfare is a touchy, complex issue with a very long history, one that involves everything from religious concern for the poor to the need for industrialized countries to grapple with the human costs of economic development. It is important, then, to examine the subject soberly and with great attention to what the past can teach us. Failure to do so can lead to examples of bad history—and bad politics, I think—such as a little gem from a user named (only somewhat ironically) \"Papist Subversive.\" Now, before I get into the meat of this essay, I should note that there are a lot of jokes about \"popery\" and \"romanism,\" here; they are intended to poke fun at the user's name, not attack Catholicism or religion generally, and certainly not to endorse atheism. I actually kinda like Catholicism. That, and \"checkmate, atheists!\" is just too classic of a meme not to put in here. But without further ado, the bad history itself:\n\n \n\nhttp://archive.is/x0yh9\n\n \n\n“The situation of the black community today is the result of \"free shit\" laws. Lyndon B. \"I'll have those niggers voting Democrat for the next two hundred years\" Johnson's Great Society program made breaking apart black families more financially expedient than keeping them together. At that point, blacks were well on their way to achieving more-or-less social and economic equality. But that wasn't politically expedient, so it had to be stopped. It's a fucking tragedy.”\n\n \n\nWe run into our first problem with that “quote” from Johnson. As a thread from /r/AskHistorians tells us, there’s scanty evidence for Johnson ever using that particular turn of phrase, and even scantier proof that the expressed sentiment was genuine:\n\n \n\nhttp://archive.is/nTS5M\n\n \n\nTo reiterate what the top answer said, the only record for that statement comes from a single book, and Ron Kessler wasn’t exactly an unbiased source. While Johnson was a prolific dropper of the N-Bomb, it was only to be expected from a Texan living in that time period, regardless of whether or not one actually hated blacks. \n\nStill, I oughtn’t defend Johnson overmuch. In an address given at the University of Texas, President Obama noted that Johnson voted against civil rights legislation for most of his career.[1] We can legitimately debate how sincere Johnson’s concern for blacks was—it’s easy to say he was merely an unscrupulous politician interested in absolutely nothing but his own advancement, but his biographers, like Robert A. Caro, believe there was an underlying core of genuine compassion beneath his ugly racist language and political machinations. Caro notes that Johnson had been a schoolteacher for Mexican children during the 1920s, a time when Mexicans were hated not much less than blacks, and that Johnson’s aides described him being brought “almost to tears” by the indignities his black staff suffered.[2] \n\nIn any case, however, all that is a debate for another time. The point here is to note that Johnson likely never said that about the Great Society, and even if he did, he was likely just trying to curry votes from a Dixiecrat politician; his genuine motivations were either borne of actual concern for poor people (if you agree with Caro) or a desire to create a great legacy for himself, with the “Great Society” putting him in the history books just like the New Deal did for Roosevelt or the Emancipation Proclamation did for Lincoln or whatever. “Political expediency” was likely a tertiary concern, at best.\n\n \n\nBut OK, let’s overlook the probable falsehood and irrelevancy of that supposedly slam-dunk quote. How about the actual argument itself—that the black population in the U.S. was reaching economic and social parity with the rest of the nation before Great Society programs (such as welfare) unleashed a tidal wave of dusky sluts and single mothers while Bill Cosby and the Statue of Liberty wept mournful tears off to the side? As you’ll probably be able to tell, the truth is rather more complicated.\n\n \n\nFor most of the first half of the 20th century, African Americans lagged behind whites on a variety of social and economic indices. “Northern racism—generally de facto rather than de jure,” as Ira Berlin notes, “proved just as durable as the Southern version. When industrial production plummeted in the 1930s, black men and women lost many of their earlier gains…On the eve of World War II, the economic standing of most Southern migrants had hardly improved…Residential segregation increased steadily during the twentieth century…By the 1940s…the place of black men and women in the most dynamic sector of the American economy remained precarious. Unemployment among black men and women was at least twice as high for black as for white workers, and discrimination—indeed outright exclusion—was common…Prior to World War II, few black men and women—6 percent compared to 37 percent of whites—could be found [in white collar jobs].”[3]\n\n \n\nAll that looks pretty bad for the 1940s. But how about the post-war situation? As it happened, government civil-rights initiatives, such as Executive Order 8802 (thanks to A Philip Randolph’s pressure on Roosevelt) and Truman’s order to desegregate the army did lead to marked improvement for the black community. Berlin continues on to tell us that “centuries-old employment practices that had throttled the advancement of black people withered under the glare of national publicity…Between 1940 and 1960, the proportion of black men and women employed in white collar jobs doubled.”[4]\n\n \n\nLooking pretty good, huh? Enough to make one think our brave Papist had a point in saying blacks were “catching up.” Not so fast, though. Even these happy statistics had a shadow lurking behind them. Berlin is also very scrupulous in noting that the federal programs which established a basis for white middle-class prosperity—namely the GI Bill and the Federal Housing Administration’s aid to families wishing to find good homes for themselves—ignored blacks. “In the decades following the war, the level of urban residential segregation increased until the indices of dissimilarity—which measured the degree of segregation—reached 90 percent, meaning that almost the entire population would have to move to achieve a random distribution of whites and blacks.”[5]\n\n \n\nMore importantly (segregation might seem bad for most of us, but more than a few righties I’ve seen have no problem with it in and of itself), the prosperity blacks were attaining was based on an extremely precarious foundation. A block quote from the inimitable Berlin is called for here, I believe:\n\n \n\n&gt;But while the black middle class gained ground at midcentury, black industrial workers lost it, as the ladder of industrial employment collapsed, and with it the possibilities of rising within the industrial hierarchy…factories—lured by low taxes, better roads, access to new markets, and nonunion labor—abandoned Northern cities for the suburbs, then left the suburbs for the South, and then the South for foreign destinations. Many factories closed, never to open again. Disproportionately, these were in heavy industries…where black workers had enjoyed a substantial presence…Unions, into which black workers had at long last been incorporated, lost their ability to protect seniority and guard against discrimination…Once again, excluded from the dynamic sector of the American economy, buffeted by the changing nature of production, and tied to the most vulnerable industries, black men and women saw their conections to regular work unraveling. Many of those who had found prosperity and security working in a unionized factory could only find hourly work flipping burgers…They had joined the industrial working class just when a substantial portion was being discarded as obsolete. The absence of regular employment and a living wage demoralized working people, particularly young men and women. Black families, which had survived slavery and segregation, frayed, as men—without access to work—had difficulties supporting their wives and children. Between 1960 and 1975, the number of black households without male wage earners increased from 22 to 35 percent. *Along with the disappearance of black men from family life came a dramatic increase in the number of households with children born out of wedlock* [emphasis added].[6]\n\n \n\nYou’ll note he makes no mention of the Great Society. So, as we can see, it is not necessarily true that “the situation of the black community today is a result of the ‘free shit’ laws.” That lamentable “situation” can be ascribed at least as much to the economic problems which hammered the black working class.\n\n \nNow, those problems were not the only ones facing black families. While several rigorous, skilled, and righteous historians (such as Herbert Gutman) have argued that African American family structure persisted throughout slavery, more recent scholarship has shown that even before the “Great Society,” black families experienced higher levels of disruption than white ones. As James T. Patterson has noted, several studies published in the early 90s looked at census data from the South during the early 20th century and found that many black women called themselves “widows” to census-takers if the father of their children wasn’t around--even if he was still alive. This led the census to undercount the actual numbers of black “single mothers,” and it also led Gutman to conclude that family breakup among blacks was less of a problem after emancipation than it actually was.[7]\n\n \n\nNeedless to say, we should now be very suspicious of our Papist’s claim that black families were “reaching parity” with whites before those evil liberals (like LBJ) ruined everything.\n\n \n\nThis is not to deny, of course, the tremendous progress blacks made after emancipation. In the space of a hundred years (from 1860 to 1960), this people had pulled themselves up from a state of subservience and degradation, all the while facing incessant predation and terrorism from whites in both the South and the North (the KKK in the former, race rioters in the latter, among many, many others), to create a growing and prosperous middle class. That is undoubtedly an accomplishment worthy of note. I must also heed the warnings of other scholars not to make too much hay over the idea that blacks were “damaged” by slavery—you get things like Stanley Elkins’ well-meaning but, in retrospect, rather unfortunate usage of the “Sambo” stereotype.[8] So when I refute papist_subversive’s argument that blacks had “nearly achieved parity” with whites, I don’t mean to imply blacks had made no progress at all. I am saying, however, that we cannot blind ourselves to the problems blacks (or any other marginalized group) actually have if we hope to actually help in solving them.\n\n \n\nI would say all of this is a reasonably solid defense of the motives behind the Great Society, and perhaps a less ringing though still respectable exoneration from the charge that it destroyed the black family for mere “political expediency.” Alas, it is also possible this isn’t enough for our heroic Traditionalist. Perhaps he might persist in saying something like this:\n\n \n\n“O-o-okay, m-maybe the historical legacy of slavery left more of an impact on the black family than I thought, a-and maybe large-scale shifts in the national economy and employment market rendered the African American male breadwinner more vulnerable and thus made the African American nuclear family less stable. M-maybe I can’t blame *everything* on those damn dirty liberals. But, but! I have *economics* on my side! People respond to incentives, you see! If you pay women—through welfare or other Great Society social programs or whatever—to have children outside of wedlock, OF COURSE they will! S-so in the end, the Great Society is still responsible for weakening the black family, just not solely responsible! Checkmate, atheists!”\n\n \n\nUh-huh. But once again, a closer examination might reveal the truth to be more complex.\n\n \n\nWe return to the question of incentives. Let us be generous and entertain the argument (and I will admit it’s not unreasonable) that if women are given attractive alternatives to marriage and raising children alongside a male provider—such as “free” money and provision from the government, thanks to Great Society welfare programs—a proportion of women will do so, heedless of the subtler costs this inflicts on sons and daughters who grow up without fathers.\n\n \n\nIf this were the case, however, it would seem reasonable to assume that the number of women who would be lured away from stable, monogamous relationships by government largesse would be proportionate to and correlated with the size of that largesse. Do we see that in reality?\n\n \n\nSurprising as it may sound (and I would wager it would very much surprise our erstwhile protagonist), not quite. A very useful book that tells us a great deal about this phenomenon is *Promises I Can Keep,* by Kathryn Edin and Maria Kefalas. The whole thing is worth reading, but they very aptly demolish this argument in one succinct paragraph on page 199:\n\n \n\n“The expansion of the welfare state could not have been responsible for the growth in nonmarital childbearing during the 1980s and 1990s for the simple reason that in the mid 1970s all states but California stopped adjusting their cash welfare benefits for inflation. By the early 1990s a welfare check’s real value had fallen nearly to 30 percent. Meanwhile, marriage rates continued to decline while the rate of unmarried childbearing showed persistent growth.”[9]\n\n \n\nSo much for the “incentives” argument! I’d wager this little factoid would drive the Subversive (along with Murray Rothbard and more than a few libertardian economists—not that our hero has any relationship with them today, no, he now understands that libertarianism, however noble, is too close to libertinism and we need True Catholic Economics™ to guide us to prosperity) to despair.\n\n \n\nSo, what actually did cause the rise of babymommas? According to Edin and Kefalas, a combination of culture and comparative opportunity costs. “For the poor and affluent alike,” they say, “marriage is now much less about sex, coresidence, and raising children than it used to be. In a cultural context where everyone had to marry to achieve a minimal level of social acceptance…The sexual revolution, the widespread availability of birth control, the dramatic increase in the social acceptability of cohabitation, and the growing rejection of the idea that a couple should get or stay married just because there is a child on the way, have all weakened the once nearly absolute cultural imperative to marry…in the late 1950s eight in ten Americans believed a woman who remained unmarried was “sick, neurotic, or immoral,” while only a quarter still held that view in 1978.”[10]\n\n \n\nNow, at this point, someone like the OP would probably start cheering. “Yeah! See, I knew it! It was those damn liberals after all! As True Catholics™ like me know, sex outside of marriage is Objectively Wrong (because of something about the Platonic True Essence/End/something else of the sexual act which is supposedly obvious regardless of religion because Plato and Aristotle said so. Aristotle also thought that women had fewer teeth than men, so I’d personally take him with a grain of salt, but that’s just me). Hitler was right! Or, uh, would have been right if he were a good Catholic rather than a filthy demotist!”[11]\n\n\n\nMm-hmm. Well, hold off on the celebration for just a moment, brave champion of the Church. First, even if you can blame “leftist degeneracy” for the plight of lower-class blacks (and the poor in general), you can’t blame Johnson or the Great Society in particular for it. As the inflation statistics imply, there’s not a very strong relationship between “free shit” programs (referring to the quote this whole Badhistory essay is based on) and the rise of single mothers/family breakups.\n\n \n\nSecond, all these violations of “natural law” seem to be affecting the poor more than the middle and upper classes. All the black single mothers popping out “thugs” (and, to be fair, all the white ones popping out the kind of people you see on the Maury Povich show) are generally of much more concern to conservatives (Catholic and secular alike) than, say, some wealthy woman purchasing a rich doctor’s genes from a sperm bank and raising the resulting ubermensch without the aid of a husband.[12] Why might this be so? Well, Edin and Kefalas explain this with a concept that should be very familiar to anyone with even a passing familiarity with economics—opportunity costs. Perhaps the OP picked up on this during his journey through anarcho-capitalism, perhaps not, but either way, Edin and Kefalas provide a good description of the phenomena:\n\n \n\n“So the incentives and disincentives for childbearing are very different from women at different class levels. We are not saying that early childbearing costs nothing—in fact, it demands a large share of these [poor] mothers’ meager resources. But the *out of pocket costs* of kids…are incurred regardless of the age or marital status of the parent. However, the lost future earnings—what economists call an *opportunity cost*--that women at different class levels face when they have children early are quite different. The public often assumes that early childbearing is the main reason why so many girls from poor inner-city areas fail to complete high school…or earn decent wages, but there is virtually no evidence to support this idea. Ironically, however, any childbearing at all, and especially early childbearing, has huge opportunity costs for middle class women. *Disadvantaged girls who bear children have about the same long-term earnings trajectories as similarly disadvantaged youth who wait until their mid or late twenties to have a child* [emphasis added]…In other words, early childbearing is highly selective of girls whose other characteristics—family background, cognitive ability, school performance, mental health status, and so on—have already diminished their life chances so much that an early birth does little to reduce them much further.”[13]\n\n \n\nIn this quote, the authors’ intent (and mine in restating it) is not—at least not necessarily—to disparage the importance of the nuclear family nor to advocate for sexual promiscuity. It is, however, to point out that common conservative laments about “cultural degeneracy” typically fail to account for the whole picture. I suppose the epidemic of single motherhood among the “lower orders” could be solved by stuffing Aquinas and Plato down their throats, or perhaps just going full Taliban and executing anyone who dared have extramarital sex, but both “solutions” might be a tad hard to implement in a large, pluralistic country such as the U.S. A better solution might take a page from *Promises I Can Keep* and examine the comparative opportunity costs facing poor women, black and white. Giving such people attractive alternatives to childbearing as a source of personal fulfillment—which middle and upper-class women have found, if the differentials in unmarried birthrates say anything—might well go some distance in alleviating these social issues.\n\n \n\nI’ll be the first to admit such an effort would be difficult, though. Certainly more difficult than sitting on Reddit complaining about a former President and his “free shit” laws, and also lacking that *frisson* of smug self-satisfaction that comes from claiming to be so much more logical and rational than all those “sentimental,” “emotional” thinkers who…attempt to empirically gauge the causes and effects of social policy and form conclusions based on evidence.\n\n \n\nBut for some reason or another, that’s the approach I’d choose. If that would make me a bad Romanist and/or Aristotelian, I think I’ll live.[14]\n\n[1] W. Gardner Selby, “Lyndon Johnson opposed every civil rights proposal considered in his first 20 years as lawmaker” last accessed at http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/apr/14/barack-obama/lyndon-johnson-opposed-every-civil-rights-proposal/ on 5/4/2016. The video is in the article and Obama talks about Johnson’s record at 12 minutes in. I’ve heard that politifact has been criticized as a source before, but the article cites Caro’s biography of Johnson (the second book, *Means to Ascent*), which by all accounts is excellent, so I think it’s fairly reliable.\n\n[2] Robert A.

Tauris)--to be fair, however (thanks /u/Rivka333) this misconception may have arose from women in antiquity having [poorer nutrition and more children](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17917610). The joke about Hitler was a reference to how reactionaries like the OP tend to parrot Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn’s argument that Hitler was not a dictator but an example of “democracy in action” because he claimed to rule “in the name of the people.” Curiously, they tend to be pretty vague about how their ideal Catholic autocratic monarch would actually differ from Hitler in terms of governance. The most concrete answers I’ve seen revolve around converting Das Juden rather than killing them—I actually informed this redditor that the Nazis hated the Jewish religion as well as the race, a factoid which surprised him immensely—or exterminating blacks and native americans rather than Jews. I’m not making the latter craziness up, see these two entries from the neoreactionary author “Jim:” http://archive.is/tIEhX and http://archive.is/9GxDR\n\n[12] I’m sure our protagonist would still condemn the latter, of course, simply not as ferociously as he would condemn the former.\n\n[13] Edin and Kefalas, 205.\n\n[14] Again, a disclaimer: The references to “Romanism” and “popery” scattered throughout are just jokes, and are by no means seriously intended as attacks on religion generally, much less endorsements of atheism.",

        "text": "One of my least favorite fashion history myths, as it's so commonly believed and the believers are so resistant to debunking.\n\nIn early April, the History in Pictures FB page [posted a late 1850s image](https://www.facebook.com/historyallday/photos/a.1417075835221721.1073741827.1417074428555195/1683879735207995/?type=3) of a woman in a hoop skirt roughly six feet wide, being dressed by maids standing on chairs and maneuvering her gown in the air with sticks, presenting it as a straightforward, non-satirical image. The problem? It's not a real representation of women's clothing at all. (I pointed this out at the time and didn't meet with much success. Having waited out the required amount of time and then some, I now present it to you.)\n\nThe image is originally from a set of stereocards, tinted versions of which can be found in the Howarth-Loomes Collection at National Museums Scotland:\n\n[Putting on a Crinoline](http://www.nms.ac.uk/explore/search-our-collections/collection-item/?item_id=20029235)\n\n[Crinoline Made Useful](http://www.nms.ac.uk/explore/search-our-collections/collection-item/?item_id=20029233)\n\n[The Discovery](http://www.nms.ac.uk/explore/search-our-collections/collection-item/?item_id=20029236)\n\n[New Omnibus Regulation](http://www.nms.ac.uk/explore/search-our-collections/collection-item/?item_id=20029238)\n\n[Crinolines](http://www.nms.ac.uk/explore/search-our-collections/collection-item/?item_id=20029239)\n\nMost people today are familiar with hoop skirts through movies (which, do I even need to say it, aren't primary sources) and through the [many, many satirical cartoons and illustrations](https://www.google.com/search?q=crinoline+satire&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;biw=1280&amp;amp;bih=963&amp;amp;site=webhp&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwis-7jar8PMAhWEND4KHeHoDq8Q_AUIBygC) produced during the 1850s and 1860s.\n\nComparing these stereoviews and illustrations to ordinary, serious images makes it clear how strongly they're exaggerated. [This fashion plate](http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O576931/le-salon-fashion-plate-unknown/) shows the size and shape of the fashionable skirt in 1859, shortly after the stereoviews were taken. [\"The Marriage of Princess Alice, 1st July 1862\"](https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/404479/the-marriage-of-princess-alice-1st-july-1862) puts fashionably-dressed women among men and in a large room, giving some more context and perspective, and they're nowhere near as unwieldy. By comparing the diameters of hoops in fashion plates and portraits to the height of their wearers, it can be seen that most women during the period would have worn them from about 90\" to 120\" around, depending on their height and level of fashionability - this means diameters ranging from 26\" to 38\". Get out a yardstick or measuring tape, put it on the floor, and stand over it to see how narrow that really is in comparison to the stereoview. *Do it.*\n\nYou can also see from [fashion plates](http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O576933/zaguretta-victoria-andalouse-maconnaise-verezie-fashion-plate-heloise-leloir/) and [portraits](https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/400807/princess-alice-1843-78-later-grand-duchess-of-hessev) that the fashionable skirt shape in the late 1850s was much more rounded, more like a bell. Not a flat, splayed cone.\n\nThe construction of the hoops in this set of images is also nothing like what was done at the time. [Cage crinolines](http://collections.lacma.org/node/214126) were made out of spring steel - named thus because it was originally intended for watch springs - usually wrapped with a woven cover, and running through vertical tapes with narrow channels in them. Most likely for visual impact, the ones in the satirical photographs are made with fewer hoops, but thicker (even lumpier) ones. The spring steel allowed crinolines to bend and flex, so the wearers could get through doorways and sit inside carriages. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4hgfw4/scots_is_a_dialect_of_english_and_has_always_been/",
        "text": "As some of you might know from my frequent complaints about it, I've currently writing my BA dissertation on language change in early modern Scotland, with particular focus on the lowlands\n\nSo when I saw this\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/4fy9m9/cornish_language_funding_stopped_by_government/d2d97f5\n\nSpecifically\n\n&gt;Lallans or Scots is a dialect of English, and has always been considered so\n\nI felt compelled to respond. I'll ignore the latter half of the post because it's more linguistics than history. To put a long story short, Scots has definitely not always been regarded as a dialect of English. It's been recognized as being related to English, usually under the branch of \"Teutonick\", or \"Saxon\", and mutually intelligibility has been historically discussed, but during the \"heyday of Scots as a full national language\", as David Murison puts it, and even for a while after, Scots and English have been recognized as being different languages by the international community. Any conflation of the two has usually been confined to England, and the odd Scottish writer sympathetic to a union between the two countries.\n\nQuoting mostly from my dissertation with some additions\n\n\"The author of the anonymous 1548 work, The Complaynt of Scotland, laid out a case for there being manifold cultural differences between England and Scotland, including differences in language. In England, correspondence in Scots was both written and received, though it was often tinged with some Anglicisation. In 1556, King Philip and queen Mary of England addressed a letter dated to Mary of Guise queen dowager and regent of Scotland that read:\n\n&gt;\"Rycht excellent, rycht, heich and mychtie princesse our dearest suster and allia We recommend ws hairtlie unto yow, and quhair of laitt within these four or fyve yeiris certane of the subjectis of this our realme have with our gude licence usit trafficque into partis of Muscovia aboute the feate of mercheandice...\"\n\nWhich definitely doesn't look like the English of the period. The whole letter does have some elements of English in it, (frome rather than fra, our rather than ower, forasmuch rather than forsameikle), and the fact that we can recognize such differences shows that they definitely weren't the same thing.\n\nIn 1624, the English operating in Ireland petitioned for clerks who spoke Scots, because their Scottish peers' letters could \"not be read or understood.'\n\nIn 1578, the Italian tutor John Florio wrote that Elizabeth I was able to speak eight languages, “Scottish” among them, listed separately from English. Supporting this, the Scottish wife of Irish Lord Turlough O’Neill, Agnes Campbell, penned a letter in Scots to Elizabeth I in 1571, because she could not speak English.\n\nIn the 16th century, Scottish priest Ninian Winzet wrote an angry letter to John Knox, complaining that he could not understand Knox's writing anymore, and they would have to correspond in Latin. Knox had started to write in a heavily anglicised version of Scots, which McClure has suggested calling \"Anglo-Scots\". It's been suggested that Winzet was just being a bit cheeky, and I'm inclined to agree, but the fact that he even made the joke shows that there was a recognized difference.\n\nIn the early 16th century, the Scottish philosopher Florence Wilson was said by Frenchman Barthelemy Aneau to be fluent in several languages, including “Escossais”, but not English. In 1590, during a meeting with Dutch Envoys, one Colonel Stuart at the court of James VI (as recorded by an English writer) “had drawn up a certain writing, first in Scotch” which he had to translate to Latin to be understood. In 1498, Don Pedro de Ayala, Spanish ambassador to James IV, remarked that Scottish and English were \"as different as the languages of Aragon and Castille\". In 1533 in Sweden, the Scots book The Richt Way To the Kingdome of Hevine was published by reformer John Gau, translated from Danish for a Scottish audience.\n\nThese examples, and many others besides, clearly demonstrate that the international consideration of Scots in the 16th century was that it was just another European language like any other, of no less prestige or status than English and certainly not junior or otherwise inferior to it. According to Joanna Kopaczyk, it is imperative that 16th century Scots be recognised as a typical European language of the period, one progressing towards a codified standardization, though it never quite reached that stage.\"\n\nMy main sources are\n\n&gt;Contemporary References to the Scottish Speech of the Sixteenth Century, by Marjorie Bald, in The Scottish Historical Review, Vol. 25, 1928.\n\n&gt;NOSTRA VULGARI LINGUA, by Dauvit Horsbroch\n\nI suppose I should cite myself too, don't want to get done for plagiarism. \n\n&gt;An Examination of the Process by which Scotland became an English-speaking Nation, by /u/Ultach",

As with last time, I will place a claim in an indent, along with the relevant time it was made so you can see it for yourselves.\n\n&gt;0:15 You must think being alone is a punishment.\n\nThis is our teacher, Mr J Shipinski himself, portrayed as a turtle in a tropical locale for no discernible reason.\n\n&gt;0:25 *Prepares to eat a lettuce*\n\nCome on! You're on a tropical island, where the eff is an effing iceberg lettuce going to come from? It's like you're not even trying! (which, incidentally, is the theme for this video)\n\n&gt;0:21-0:31\n\nShipinski waffles on about how isolated civilizations come to be. Personally, I think that for isolation to develop, more is required than food, security and 'alone time' (whatever that means, like, surely the 'alone time' develops as a consequence of being isolated?), but then I'm not an anthropologist or a political scientist, so whatever.\n\n&gt;0:30-0:40 Let's look at three civilizations\n\nThis is where the focus of the video lies (no pun intended): a comparative study of three 'isolated' civilizations: Ancient Egypt, Pre-Columbian Maya and Medieval Japan.\n\n&gt;0:40 All of them were isolated from invaders\n\nYou could argue that point for Japan and the Maya. Japan is a challenge to invade on account of it being a very mountainous island and the Mayans' home area is mostly dense jungle. However, Egypt was very much not isolated from invaders. Ancient Egypt was invaded (and conquered!) multiple times, such as by the Hittites, Sea People, Persians, Babylonians...the list goes on.\n\n&gt;0:44 Egypt had a large sea to the north and deserts to their west and east.\n\nThis is more of geography fail, but I'll lump it in anyway. While seas are an obstacle for invaders, they *don't* necessarily stop an invasion force in their tracks, especially when said seas are some of the most heavily used and easily navigable in the world (i.e.: the southern Med). The 'deserts' are utterly false: the fertile crescent lies directly to Egypt's east, and the west contains the Libyan coast, which is actually quite green. It's also telling that Shipinski doesn't mention the south, as that direction contained the Nubians and other African groups, all of which went to war with the Egyptian states at one point or another.\n\n&gt;1:50 Because none of these civilizations had to invade other nations for resources, they remained relatively peaceful.\n\nThis is complete horseshit. As previously stated, Ancient Egypt was invaded multiple times and the Egyptians invaded other states as well, such as the Nubian kingdoms to their south. As for the Maya, well, their civilization was divided up into multiple city-states, like other Mesoamerican civilizations. Also, like other Mesoamerican civilizations, **these city-states fought each other constantly**. Shipinski is sort-of right about Japan, but the country was a war-zone immediately prior to the Tokugawa isolationist period, which itself only lasted for around 220 years.\n\n&gt;2:00 [They] had no need to conquer new lands.\n\nApart from Egypt, which invaded Nubia and Palestine numerous times, partly to get their mits on the resources which you mentioned earlier that they were happy to trade for.\n\n&gt;2:08-2:25 (lists a series of Egyptian inventions)\n\nWhile it is true that the Egyptians did create all these things, I think it's more than a little misleading to say that this was a consequence of their isolation, because, as I stated previously, they were not isolated. Plus, it's not like all these things were invented in a short period of time either. For a frame of reference, papyrus was likely invented around 4000 BC and the Great Pyramid of Giza was built in 2560 BC.\n\n&gt;2:30 the Macedonians, who lacked ample farmland, ended Egyptian rule by Egyptians.\n\nWhile it is true that after the Macedonian conquest no further Egyptians would rule Egypt, it wasn't like this hadn't happened before, such as when the Persians conquered the region. I also think the farmland claim is wee bit suspect, but I don't know enough about Alexander's conquests to comment further.\nShipinski lists more inventions here, and he'll do the same for the Japanese in a bit. To save some time, allow me to say that is very much conflation. While these civilizations did produce a number of interesting things, so did everyone who wasn't isolated, so this point makes no sense.\n\n&gt;2:48 For some reason, in the 900s AD, their [the Maya] civilization disappeared under a veil of mystery.\n\nWhile we don't know exactly why the Mayan city-states disappeared (it's worth noting that the Maya themselves do still exist), one of the prevailing theories has it that warfare between the city-states had become more extreme, as later settlements tend to be denser, have stronger defensive works and are generally constructed in more defensible locations. Of course, the Maya fighting each other would damage Shipinski's pet theory, so he simply ignores it.\n\n&gt;2:58 [The Japanese] created a new type of religious Buddhism called 'Zen'.\n\nNo, they didn't. Zen Buddhism originated not only in a *different time period* to the Tokugawa Shogunate, but also in a *different country*, Tang-dynasty China. Also, please note how the bunny rabbit turns into a Ying-Yang symbol, which has nothing at all to do with Zen or Buddhism but is actually the symbol of Taoism. This is kind of like using the Crescent and Star to symbolise Christianity.\n\n&gt;3:10 [The Japanese] invented an entirely new economic system called feudalism.\n\nHahahahahahaha, hahahaha, WHAT?\n\n*Seriously, WHAT?!*\n\n**ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?**\n\nThe Japanese did not invent feudalism! I don't even know where to begin with a statement that fucking stupid! Feudalism was first developed in Europe around the 9th century and a similar system had been operating in Imperial China from earlier than that! Japanese feudalism emerged roughly in the 12th and 13th centuries, hundreds of years before the isolationist period of the Tokugawa shogunate, which began 1635 with the seclusion laws. *Also, feudalism is not an economic system, it's a form of politics!* Why the fuck would you say otherwise?!\n\n&gt;3:26 Their isolation ended when they chose to work with others to gain new technologies.\n\n[This here is Commodore Matthew Perry of the U.S Navy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Commodore_Matthew_Calbraith_Perry.png/800px-Commodore_Matthew_Calbraith_Perry.png). In 1853 he sailed into Edo bay and told the Shogunate that if they didn't open Japan up to trade, he would start blowing up their capital with his warship. The Shogunate agreed, allowing other imperialist powers to engage in their own gunboat diplomacy to get what they wanted from the Shogun. Japan was forced into re-opening trade because it was so blatantly apparent to everyone how technologically backward they had become. It was change or die.\n\nThere a little bit more waffle before the video ends, but Shipinski is finished with his claims. I think the general gist here is the bizarre assertion that isolationist societies develop faster technologically than those that aren't. While this is clearly intended in a 'think about things a different way to broaden your minds, guise!' way, it doesn't disguise the fact that isolationism is a *terrible* strategy for societies in the long term. Isolated societies in general are politically stable internally, so innovation tends to be discouraged as new inventions and ideas would upset the status quo. Unfortunately, this leads to isolationist states slipping further and further behind their neighbours until the outside world comes a knockin'. We can see this with Mali, Imperial China and Japan, all of which suffered terribly at the hands of more technologically advanced foreign invaders. I have no words for how utterly and completely incorrect this entire video is. It's just a constant barrage of falsehoods and lies, with Shipinski completely ignoring evidence that contradicts it! Why was this ever approved to be broadcast under the TED brand?\n\n**TL;DR: Elderly turtle pushes his own completely bollocks theory on how isolationism is, like, the best for countries, and completely ignores evidence that suggests it isn't.**\n\nSources:\n\n*The Lost Kingdoms of Africa*, Gus Casely-Hayford\n\n*Atrocitology*, Matthew White\n\nSome book on the samurai and Japanese society that I have misplaced.",

        "text": "Ok then, so I'm a huge fan of this manga called Kingdom, and it's ostensibly based on Chinese history about the rise of a Qin peasant boy to great general during the warring states era, however, even I as an amateur with access to wikipedia, have found some glaring holes in the stroy. The first of all is that the story's protagonist is based off of  Li Xin, who was a relatively minor figure that proposed conquering the superstate of Chu with 200,000 against the wishes of a senior general who proposed 600,000 and summarily got his ass handed to him when the Chu counterattacked at an opportune moment. After that he disappears from history. Hardly great general material. But whatever, obscure enough that the author basically has free reign with his history to the point where I'm like, 'friends with the king? Why not\"\nThen, at chapter 257, the author distorts history to an unimaginable degree. The story is basically that some super genius of the Zhao state somehow realizes that the Qin are bent on China conquest (IDK how, but the explanation sounded smart) and convinced the other powers to work together in a coalition war against the Qin and they send an army through kankoku pass to invade the Qin capital after overwhelming the rest of the country's defenses. In a desperate last ditch effort the Qin defenders stop the coalition right at the gates to the capital. It's basically one epic fight involving lots of tactics which boils down to someone decapitates someone else. So pumped up by the fight, and interested in learning the rl details of the thing, I look up kankoku pass. The only search results are for the manga. Utterly confused, I look up the coalition war. Nope, nothing. Finally,I just look up China's reunification, and learn why I couldn't find anything. Kankoku pass doesn't exist, and the coalition war never happened. The Qin's unification of China were wars they started (at least, they never suffered a major coalition war as the manga claims). My source? Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin%27s_wars_of_unification.\n\nTL:DR The manga is awesome. It is not historically accurate and is more akin to historical fantasy than history with liberties taken. \n\nHere's a mangahere link to the manga\nhttp://www.mangahere.co/manga/kingdom/\n\nThe chapters of the coalition arc are from 257 to 356\n\nI hope this is an acceptable contribution to the community. \n",

There was plenty of strife within Mohammad's lifetime.\n\n\nThe Sunni-Shi'a split was not as pronounced early on as is it is today, the First Fitna was a political conflict in which both sides evolved to become religious sects. This is very reductionist. It ignores all the political implications of the Sunni-Shi'a rivalries and paints as being purely religious. The on-going complex Iranian-Saudi cold war is not a continuation of centuries old feud between the Sunnis and Shi'as, consider that in the 60's the Saudis supported the Houthis in the Yemeni civil war, or that Saudia Arabia has close ties with the predominately Shi'a Azerbaijan or that Iran is close to the Sunni organization Hamas, which is a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood which is opposed by Saudia Arabia, or that Saudia Arabia and Iran had very normal relations prior to the Islamic Revolution of 1979. \n\nSecondly, there are many periods of peace and stability in the Middle East after Mohammad's death.\n\n&gt;The crusades didn't help and fostered a lot of resentment of western culture.\n\nThe Crusades is irrelevant in Islamic history and not really a major event, it's much more important in Western history that it is in Islamic one.

        "text": "So, Ken Livingstone, a member of the UK Labour party which has recently had a little internal kerfuffle over anti-Semitism, appeared on BBC London in an interview defending Naz Shah, a now suspended MP, who had some unfavorable past tweets dug up. This is my first submission and I'm awfully frightened of breaking Rule 2 so I'll skip those.\n\nA link to text of the interview in question:\n\nhttps://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/social-affairs/discrimination/news/74365/ken-livingstone-bbc-radio-london-israel-lobby-tries\n\nThere's a lot to talk about there, but I'm going to do my best to avoid any politics and just focus on his boldest statement:\n\n&gt;Let’s remember when Hitler won his election in 1932, his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism – this before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews. \n\nNow, some of you may not know this, but some historians *tend* to disagree with the idea that Hitler was a supporter of Zionism.\n\nHere's what Hitler himself had to say on Zionism in *Mein Kampf* (from the particularly happy chapter, 'Nation and Race'):\n\n&gt; ... while the Zionists try to make the rest of the world believe that the national consciousness of the Jew finds its satisfaction in the creation of a Palestinian state, the Jews again slyly dupe the dumb Goyim. It doesn’t even enter their heads to build up a Jewish state in Palestine for the purpose of living there; all they want is a central organization for their international world swindle, endowed with its own sovereign rights and removed from the intervention of other states: a haven for convicted scoundrels and a university for budding crooks.\n\nNot exactly a glowing endorsement.\n\nAs for 'his policy' of moving Jews to Israel - this is a reference to the Haavara agreement. Basically, this agreement meant that German Jews emigrating to Palestine were allowed to keep their goods via a relatively roundabout transfer scheme, in which they would purchase goods from Germany, 'export' them to Palestine, and then have them redeemed for Palestinian currency on arrival. This was not Hitler's idea, and the agreement was in negotiations before Hitler achieved office as Führer. It was primarily the brainchild of Heinrich Wolff, the German consul-general of Palestine at the time, who was ~~emphatically~~ EDIT: arguably* not anti-Semitic and vocally disagreed with much of Nazi policy. \n\nIt was created in response to the anti-German boycott which was rising in popularity across Europe (although the actual impact of this boycott and the extent to which German economists of the time pinned the results of their own mistakes onto it has been debated), was most certainly *not* based on ideology, and was definitely not ever considered a real solution to the 'Jewish Problem', especially by Hitler. Hitler was, in fact, incredibly reluctant to continue the policy throughout the 1930's against the better judgement of his economists. He was absolutely not of the opinion that the Jews were to end up in Israel with their own state, i.e. Zionism.\n\nThis is all described in great detail in **The Third Reich and the Palestine Question** by **Francis Nicosia**. It's a really good book, if a little heavy on Hitler's personal influence, because - as most historians now recognize, although apparently not some British politicians - the policies of Nazi Germany and the policies that Adolf Hitler personally believed in and/or wanted in place are absolutely not one and the same.\n\nFinally, it's worth noting that saying Hitler 'went mad' some point after 1932 is pretty bizarre. It's not like Hitler woke up one day in the early 1940's and thought, \"Y'know, I'm actually not that big a fan of Jews\". I really don't think I need a source on that one.  \n\n^(*read up a bit more, turns out Wolff's attitude on German Jews is more unclear, so making a pedantic edit for the sake of accuracy)\n",

        "text": "If you’ve been fortunate enough to discuss the Iranian coup of 1953 on Reddit, you might have discovered just how polarizing it can be. Mosaddeq in particular has a tendency to be portrayed either as a paragon of democracy or a dictator leading the country straight to communist hell. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4focli/irans_president_criticized_the_use_of_thousands/) thread has far more Iranian badhistory than I could cover in a single post. For now, I’m just going to focus upon the representation of Mosaddeq as a ‘dictator’; suffice to say, the portrayals of British and American motivations and their role in the coup are also mostly terrible. Let's start with [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4focli/irans_president_criticized_the_use_of_thousands/d2b3wup) post, since it starts so well:\n\n&gt; Ajax is a hell of a lot more nuanced than Reddit makes it out to be\n\nSadly, this is almost the only part of the post I’d agree with. The rest is biased and hugely lacking in nuance. About Mosaddeq, the poster concludes:\n\n&gt; Mossadegh was not some highly principled democratic idealist. By the time he was kicked out, he was already a dictator. \n\nBefore coming to power, Mosaddeq’s National Front made demands for free elections and a free press. Mosaddeq objected strongly to the interference of the Court and army in the political process, and opposed royal power in politics. \n\nOnce in power, Mosaddeq further tried to restrict royal power. This came to a head in July 1952, when Mosaddeq demanded that the Shah give up control of the War portfolio to him. The Shah refused and Mosaddeq resigned. He was brought back into power on a wave of popular protest, and used this as legitimization to assume control of the military (he also acquired plenary powers from the parliament at this point). This populist move – reliant on mass street support – did draw criticism from amongst his support base (though some also had ulterior motives). At the same time, reducing the power of the Monarchy in favour of the Prime Minister is not an obvious sign of a dictatorship.\n\nHoma Katouzian argues that Mosaddeq’s government was “so lax that it was to prove its own undoing”. The press a great degree of freedom (which his opponents capitalised upon); the government struggled to effectively deal with known opponents to it (General Zahedi was able to take sanctuary in the parliament, for example); the elections had issues with the persisting influence of the Court, Army, and pro-British magnates; the Majlis was increasingly hindered by factionalism and became an effective means of paralysing the government for its opposition (and, as Mosaddeq would argue, many Majlis deputies had been elected on the government platform and then turned around and opposed it). All of this would contribute to Mosaddeq’s decision to hold a referendum to dissolve the Majlis. This referendum was organized very poorly, and is the low point of Mosaddeq’s democratic record (for one example, the polling areas for ‘yes’ and ‘no’ were held in separate locations); it recorded almost unanimous support for dissolving the Majlis.\n\nAt the same time, the referendum was also somewhat redundant. Two-thirds of the Majlis had already voluntarily resigned. Mosaddeq certainly wasn’t a perfect democrat, however, painting him as a ‘dictator’ has a lot of problems. In general, he was trying to consolidate his power against non-democratic forces. If he had been a dictator he would’ve had a much better chance of staying in power, really. On balance, h's closer to the 'principled idealist' than he is to the 'dictator'. Another important point is that plans for covert action against Mosaddeq had been in the works considerably before this point, so the narrative of ‘we removed Mosaddeq because he became a dictator’ has some chronological problems.\n\nThe best bit of the thread, however, comes from the comparisons between Mosaddeq and the Shah, such as [this one:](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4focli/irans_president_criticized_the_use_of_thousands/d2bhx0c)\n\n&gt;The Shah was not a dictator and did not overthrow a democratic government. That's just propaganda made up by the Islamic Republic. It was the exact opposite. The Shah was a [democratic reformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Revolution#Reforms) and the US helped him oust a PM who tried to make himself a dictator.\n\nThat's right; today you learned that Mosaddeq was a dictator removed in favour of renowned democrat Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.\n\nThis same guy uses the referendum called by Mosaddeq as conclusive proof that Mosaddeq was a dictator ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4focli/irans_president_criticized_the_use_of_thousands/d2cf6gl) for one exmaple). Ironically, he didn’t seem aware that the White Revolution was itself brought in by a dubiously overwhelming referendum. The Shah consolidated power into his own hands, and would make Iran into a one party state from 1975 onwards. Mosaddeq was by no means perfect, but the idea that he was more of a dictator than the Shah is pretty laughable. Extending the franchise such that more people are allowed to vote for a single party does not really make you a \"democratic reformer\". Unless you count reforming a democracy into a dictatorship. I don't think think that description of the Shah can be called accurate. The highlight of the discussion is this claim:\n\n&gt;no one forced [Mosaddeq] to become a dictator and try to kill the Shah.\n\nAs far as I’m aware, there is no evidence that Mosaddeq ever tried to kill the Shah. So I asked him to source this assertion. I then met with a most credible rebuttal:\n\n&gt;History? The National Front openly called for assassination of the Shah, and in fact, they assassinated numerous people. This is basic, it's right on Mossadegh's Wiki page.\n\nMosaddeq’s Wikipedia page has a single line which mentions members of the National Front (amongst others) calling for the Shah’s assassination. This is a bit different from the claim that Mosaddeq tried to kill the Shah. If you’re going to cite Wikipedia, you could at least cite things that it actually says. “History?” is also not a source.\n\nAfter I made this point to him (as well as pointing out that Mosaddeq’s Wikipedia page also states that “The US-backed coup, in effect, had ended Iran's last fully democratic government”) he stopped responding.\n\nSources: \n\nHistory?\n\nActual Sources:\n\nMark J.

So the Badhistory in question was in a section of this particular Haggadah where it set a timeline of events were Jews suffered, and while I'm not sure if there were other badhistory stuff (like there were a few vauge entries like \"Second Crusade\" and \"Third Crusade\") this was eye popping. \n\n&gt; 1147: Muslim tribes kill or expel Jews from Spain\n\nNow this is pretty whaaaat worthy given a few things. The first being that it wasn't \"Muslim Tribes\" that were in Spain. It was the Almohads, which while originated from tribes in Morocco, was not tribal in structure at all, far from it. While I'm not a huge expert on this subject, I'll try to clarify it. The Almohad Caliphate most resembled an organized theocratic monarchy, similar to the caliphates of South West Asia. Now I highly doubt anyone would call say the Ummayads a group of tribes, with the implication of some nomadic horse herders on a steppe, or a bunch of half naked people in tepees. The Wikipedia article isn't that bad so I'll cite it here.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almohad_Caliphate Secondly, the Almohads never controlled all of Spain. At their greatest extent (which wasn't in 1147 btw), they only controlled Andalusia, Valencia, and what would become Southern Portugal. So yeah, this is a pretty simple BH post and I hope that I satisfied R5 with it becuase it's a really bad section.",

The article starts strong with [this picture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/%D0%97%D0%93%D0%A0%D0%9B%D0%A1_%22%D0%94%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%B0%22%2C_%D0%BE%D0%B1%27%D1%94%D0%BA%D1%82_%D0%A7%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C_2._%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B0_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%85_%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BD.jpg), correctly attributed as pulled from Wikipedia and the caption reads\n\n&gt;  Das Raketenspähsystem Duga 1 nahe Tschernobyl © Олег Михайлович, Oleg Michailowitsch, CC BY-SA 4.0/Wikimedia \n\n&gt;&gt; The early warning system Duga 1 near Chernobyl. © Олег Михайлович, Oleg Michailowitsch, CC BY-SA 4.0/Wikimedia \n\nWell, [Duga 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duga-1_and_Duga-2) was the experimental system in Mykolaiv at the black sea. The picture is Duga 3, which to be fair is also located in Ukraine. At least the part that is not in Siberia, Duga 3 denotes two early warning radars, each with two sites, a transmitter and a receiver. Which the [blog they use as a source]( http://www.thelivingmoon.com/45jack_files/03files/Russian_Bases_Woodpecker_Duga_Radar_Ukraine.html) correctly points out. I will denote the entire system as well as the Chernobyl site as Duga 3, while the article consistently talks about Duga 1.  From context, especially several mentions of the Chernobyl disaster, we can easily establish that they are in fact talking about the deployed early warning system and not about the prototype system.\n\n&gt; Anders als die USA besaß die einstige Sowjetunion keinen interkontinentalen Raketenabwehrschild. Aber eben Duga 1 – sollten die Amerikaner jemals eine Atomrakete losschicken – blieb dank seiner hohen Sendeleistung genug Zeit für den atomaren Gegenstoß. \n\n&gt;&gt; In contrast to the US, the Soviet Union did not posses an intercontinental missile-shield.^1 But they had Duga 1 - if the Americans would ever launch a nuclear missile, [the Soviets] would have had enough time to launch a nuclear counterstrike, thanks to [Duga's] high power. \n\nThe high power claim is borderline /r/badscience since an over the horizon radar works thanks to the specific frequencies and has to employ a lot of very interesting signal processing to actually detect a launch. To focus on history, the early warning system of the US and the Soviet Union looked broadly similar, both employed a nuclear triad, that is bombers, ICBMs and submarine launched ballistic missiles, for their second strike capabilities. In the early sixties both had developed some anti ballistic missile capabilities^2 and both had signed the ABM treaty in the early seventies. So for the entire lifetime of Duga 3 the main difference between the US and the Soviet Union was, that the Soviet Union protected their capital by ABM measures while the US protected a missile base in North Dakota and shut down that base in 76. (Random fact: the radar of the Soviet ABM system had the Nato codename ['Doghouse'](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Doghouse_dunay3_kh7_receiver.jpg) for some reason.) \n\n&gt; \"Woodpecker\" nannte die Nato das Kurzwellensignal, das Duga 1 erzeugte.\n\n&gt;&gt; The Nato called the signal 'woodpecker'.\n\nNo. Wikipedia, as well as the blog that *Die Zeit* links as their source, are pointing out, that ham radio operators called the signal the \"Russian woodpecker.\" The Nato codename was either \"STEEL WORK\" or \"STEEL YARD.\" \n\n&gt; Getarnt war Duga 1 als Jugendferienheim, noch heute grüßt Mischka, das Maskottchen der Olympischen Sommerspiele 1980, von der Bushaltestellenwand. Zwar konnten die Bewohner Tschernobyls und auch die der Atomkraftwerkerstadt Prypjat die gigantische Silhouette im Wald aus ihren Hochhausfenstern sehen. \n\n&gt; Duga 1 was camouflaged as a youth hostel -- even today Mischka, the mascot of the 1980 Summer Olympics, adorns the wall of the bus stop. The inhabitants of Chernobyl and of the NPP city Prypiat could see its gigantic silhouette from their high rise windows. \n\nThat thing is something like 150 meters high, 400 meters long and easily visible on Google earth. Even more in the eighties some televisions in the west had filters against its interference. And now I imagine Breschnew standing atop of [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Woodpecker_array.jpg): \"Nothing to see here, go along. Just a youth hostel.\" \n\n&gt; \"Tschernobyl war der Anfang vom Ende der Sowjetunion\", hat der letzte Sowjet-Chef Michail Gorbatschow einmal gesagt. Für die Bewältigung der Katastrophe habe das Land derartig viele Ressourcen aufbringen müssen, dass für die Weiterentwicklung des Sozialismus einfach nichts mehr übrig blieb. Dass die Sowjetunion ihre komplette atomare Raketenstrategie neu konzipieren und aufbauen mussten, das hat er allerdings nicht gesagt.\n\n&gt;&gt; \"Chernobyl was the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union\" said the last head of the Soviet Union Michail Gorbatschow. The country had to spend so many resources to deal with the catastrophe that they could not longer develop socialism. He did not say, that the Soviet Union had to restart their entire nuclear strategy. \n\nWell, that is probably because their nuclear strategy was largely intact even though they lost one component of their early warning capabilities. ( A claim for which I actually did not find a good source, Wikipedia gives only a date for shutdown of the Siberian site of Duga, not for the Ukrainian site.) However, if we believe the claim, then the Soviet Union has still second strike capability thanks to the nuclear triad, early warning capability thanks to the [Oko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oko) satellites and as such their nuclear strategy was still functional. Not a big surprise, much like the internet, it was designed to function during a nuclear war. \n\nIn total the article gets the basic facts wrong, consistently tries to oversell an important component of the Soviet early warning system and constructs a difference between the USA and the USSR that was just not there. Apart from that, the half of the article I did not quote is mostly attributed to a tourist guide, and I am wondering if there is a special expression for tourist guide historiography? \n\n^1 It is a bit unclear if they are talking about countermeasures that span more than a continent or countermeasures against intercontinental ballistic missiles. \n\n^2 Anti ballistic missiles are a rather fun subject in its own right, the basic idea is to put a medium sized nuclear warhead atop of a really fast missile and detonate the nuke several kilometers over your own head.

So, this whole \"Only Presidents should be on our money\" thing has kind of fallen at the first hurdle.\n\nBut then our intrepid poster of dank Facebook maymays comes to the rescue by declaring, \"I agree it should say founding fathers.\" That would be fine except that it also doesn't match up with the picture he posted. You see, Jackson, Lincoln, and Grant weren't Founding Fathers. In fact, Grant wasn't even born until 1822 which would make it pretty hard for him to be at the Constitutional Convention thirty years earlier.\n\nThat's not the most egregious Bad History, however. As you can tell from the comments, there were multiple deleted comments that argued that Jefferson wasn't a president. I shit you not, no less than three people commented claiming that Jefferson wasn't a president. Like, is this a more common notion than I had previously realized? I was so confused that I actually had to check Wikipedia to make sure I wasn't crazy.\n\nRegardless, putting non-Founding Father, non-Presidents on money isn't exactly new.

He is, in particular, arguing with me over the idea that the execution of Süleyman's son Mustafa led to the decline of the Ottoman Empire. Nearly all modern historians agree that the \"Decline of the Ottoman Empire\" as such was a myth (on this see the bottom of this post), but this hasn't stopped him from trying to defend the idea on the basis of... quite literally nothing. [Link for the full quote, and my response:](https://www.patreon.com/posts/suleiman-lies-5195350)\n\n&gt;Hi everyone...\nWe are not historians, we have far too much respect for historians to ever claim that title, we are entertainers and, I’d like to flatter myself and say that perhaps we can claim to be educators. Our work here is synthesis, bringing together may independent viewpoints into an interpretation.\nAnd one of the key points of Extra History is that interpretations aren’t “wrong”. You may disagree with them. We had people who said we were too hard on the crusaders during The First Crusade and we had people that said we were too soft on the Soviet Union in Kursk. You may feel that Suleiman’s execution of his son didn’t lead to the decline of the empire or that Marcus Aurelius choosing his son Commodus over some far more qualified individual didn’t initiate the decline of that empire. I do, but it’s ok we disagree, interpretations of history are fought over and changed all the time. In fact understanding history, rather than simply knowing names and dates is what Extra History is all about. And finding an understanding that helps you make sense of decisions we have to make here and now, today, is the most important part. It’s why we have Lies. So everyone knows we aren’t “right” but that, like all history, we offer a perspective.\nWhich leads us to the other reason we don’t show sources. I’d rather have a vigorous debate over whether Suleiman actually lead to the decline of his empire than the thing that I think academia too often gets sidetracked by: quibbling over sources. Listing whole pages of source and reference material back and forth at one another is something I too often see in academia and on the internet, and I’d rather move to a more substantive form of discussion where we reflect on and interpret the events to help us make better sense of our world.\nAnd many of you may be studying some of the topics we cover; I will 100% cede that you probably know more about them than I do, but I’d ask you not to use that as a basis to “speak from authority” and dismiss viewpoints which are not your own or your institutions as I think it hampers the dialog that, to me, is the most important part of discussing history. Which brings us back to sources. Because this is at the root of how we get into cycles of just citing sources at one another as happens on so many internet message boards: we have two groups of people with different viewpoints and, rather than discussing the merits of those viewpoints, they begin to search for sources that agree with them to “prove” they’re right.\nSo, at the outset of Extra History, I made a personal decision that the educational merits of the show would be higher if it drove people to find their own sources and to discuss differing perspectives than to list our sources. I continue to believe that to be correct. That said, because there was such interest, this one time, I will hand out our source list:\n(This is incomplete because I did wrote this series in November/December and have had to return most of the books, but here we go ; )\nIbrahim Pasha by Hester Jankins\nOsman's Dream by Caroline Finkel\nSuleiman the Magnificent: Sultan of the East by Harold Lamb\nOttoman Centuries by Lord Kinross\nSuleiman the Magnificent by Andre Clot.\nFor Suleiman’s poetry, I’d love to know if anyone found a good anthology in English. I ended up just using a ton of websites to cross reference because I couldn’t find one I liked\n\nIn other words, he has made very clear that he thinks inadequate research based on flawed sources (four out of the five books he listed were patently unreliable) constitutes a valid and uncriticizable opinion, and that anyone who disagrees with him must have an agenda. Furthermore, that all interpretations of history are equally valid, no matter what modern academia has to say about it. When I criticized this idea, they utterly refused to engage with me, claiming to be offended that I compared their distrust of mainstream historians with the distrust Flat-Earthers and Climate Change deniers hold towards mainstream scientists. \n\nSomeone without experience in a topic gets attached to a theory, decides that they've read enough to know what they're talking about, and rejects all criticism on the basis of \"it's just a matter of opinion.\" Sounds like a fair comparison to me. I had a great deal of respect for Extra Credits, but this attitude of theirs has utterly blown me away. That the creator of a public video series meant to educate people on history could belittle the historical method as \"quibbling over sources\" is mind-boggling.\n\nTheir sources:\n\n1\\. Ibrahim Pasha by Hester Jenkins\n\nThis book was originally published in 1911, making it over one hundred years old. It was published when the Ottoman Empire still existed!\n\n2\\. Suleiman the Magnificent: Sultan of the East by Harold Lamb\n\nOriginally published in 1951, making it sixty-five years old. Based on their age alone they should have known that these two books would be totally unreliable.\n\n3\\. The Ottoman Centuries by Lord Kinross\n\nLord Kinross published his book in 1977. His bibliography was a measly 1.5 pages long and consisted of no Turkish sources. He wasn't a professional historian.\n\n4\\. Suleiman the Magnificent by André Clot\n\nLike Kinross, Clot didn't speak Turkish. Thus he couldn't make use of Turkish sources. He also wasn't a professional historian. The problems with this source and its perspective are noted in the academic review I quoted in my previous Reddit post.\n\n5\\. Osman's Dream by Caroline Finkel\n\nA good modern academic book on Ottoman history, which I wholeheartedly recommend. Thus we can conclude that four out of the five books they've revealed to us were unreliable and inaccurate.\n\nOn Decline:\n\nJane Hathaway in *The Arab Lands under Ottoman Rule, 1517-1800* (2008) p. 7-8: \n&gt;“One of the most momentous changes to have occurred in Ottoman studies since the publication of Egypt and the Fertile Crescent (1966) is the deconstruction of the so-called 'Ottoman decline thesis' - that is, the notion that toward the end of the sixteenth century, following the reign of Sultan Suleyman I (1520-66), the empire entered a lengthy decline from which it never truly recovered, despite heroic attempts at westernizing reforms in the nineteenth century. Over the last twenty years or so, as Chapter 4 will point out, historians of the Ottoman Empire have rejected the narrative of decline in favor of one of crisis and adaptation: after weathering a wretched economic and demographic crisis in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, the Ottoman Empire adjusted its character from that of a military conquest state to that of a territorially more stable, bureaucratic state whose chief concern was no longer conquering new territories but extracting revenue from the territories it already controlled while shoring up its image as the bastion of Sunni Islam.”\n\nThis is just one of dozens and dozens of sources from which I could extract similar quotes explaining that the \"Decline\" did not happen.\n\nUPDATE: I must say that they have finally provided a more satisfactory and reasonable response, accepting that there may be more to this topic than they previously knew. However, they have not yet outright admitted that their research was flawed. Nevertheless, I hope that they will sincerely consider my advice and will search for more reliable sources for their future shows.",

        "text": "[The Five Thousand Year Leap: Twenty-Eight Great Ideas That Are Changing the World is a book that was published in 1981 by author W. Cleon Skousen. The book asserts that the United States prospered because it was established upon universal natural law principles passed down from Common Law and traditional Judeo-Christian morality, as many of the Founding Fathers were guided by the Bible among others, and consequently that the U.S. Constitution incorporates enlightened ideas.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Thousand_Year_Leap)\n\nThere are some big problems with this book (aside from the ridiculous cover with an astronaut and two people in colonial garb), and I'm going to R5 them line by line based on the Wikipedia and other summaries thereof.\n\n&gt;The book lists how the Founding Fathers of the United States used 28 fundamental principles to create a society based on morality, faith, and ethics, which Skousen asserts resulted in more progress having been achieved in the last 200 years than in the previous 5,000 years of every other civilization combined.\n\nFirst of all, this is tempting to dismiss as classic \"Chart\"-type badhistory, but there is a huge problem even if you do agree that the past 200 years saw incredible amounts of progress. A lot of that progress can be attributed to the Industrial Revolution, which was [well underway](http://www.victorianweb.org/technology/ir/irchron.html) by the time the American Revolution began. **Arkwright**'s [mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromford_Mill), for instance, had already been operating for three years by the time of the revolution and over a decade by the time of the Constitution.\n\nGoing further into the book,\n\n&gt;The Founders Note the Similarities between Anglo-Saxon Common Law, and the People's law of Ancient Israel. Both are based on \"natural law\", or \"devine\" law.\n\n&gt;1. There was a commonwealth of freemen. Leviticus 25:10: \"Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof.\" (This is written on the American Liberty Bell). See Jeremiah 34:17.\n\n&gt;2. All people were organized into small units, which in turn, were organized into larger units.\n\n&gt;3. There was emphasis on strong, local self government. Problems were solved at the local, small level.\n\n&gt;4. The code of justice was based on reparation. The only crime for capital punishment was murder.\n\n&gt;5. Leaders were elected and new laws were approved by the common consent of the people. (See 2 Samuel 2:4; 1 Chr. 29:22; for rejection of a leader, see 2 Chr. 10:16 for the approval of new laws, see Exodus 19:8) 6. Accused persons were presumed to be innocent until proven guilty.\n\nTake a look at number 4 in particular. \"The only crime for capital punishment was murder.\" [Well, except for working on the Sabbath, worshiping other gods, adultery, rape, and rebelling against your parents, among others.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capital_crimes_in_the_Torah)\n\nGoing into the actual principles that allowed this \"5000-year leap\" to happen, it turns out that many were general things which an educated British Christian would likely be aware of. These 28 core principles are:\n\n\n&gt;The only reliable basis for sound government and just human relations is natural law.\n\n[Not innovative or a leap.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law) A big part of [British constitutional monarchy](http://www.monarchist.org.uk/constitutional-monarchy.html), which was well on the way to its modern form by the 1770s. \n\n&gt;A free people cannot survive under a republican constitution unless they remain virtuous and morally strong.\n\n&gt;The most promising method of securing a virtuous and a morally stable people is to elect virtuous leaders.\n\nElections are not new or unfamiliar. The [British parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_general_election,_1774) was elected, and initially the colonists simply wanted their \"rights as Englishmen\" to have seats in Parliament (\"no taxation without representation\").\n\n&gt;Without religion the government of a free people cannot be maintained.\n\n&gt;All things were created by God, therefore upon Him all mankind are equally dependent, and to Him they are equally responsible.\n\n&gt;All men are created equal.\n\nRemember that 200 years ago the US was a slaveholding society. As early as 1705 [the British recognized no place for slavery in common law, with slavery only being something of the colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_British_Isles#Judicial_decisions).\n\n&gt;The proper role of government is to protect inalienable rights of all individuals equally.\n\nThis again can be traced to Locke, Montesquieu, and Rousseau among others.\n\n&gt;Men are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights.\n\n&gt;To protect man's rights, God has revealed certain principles of divine law.\n\n&gt;The God-given right to govern is vested in the sovereign authority of the whole people.\n\n&gt;The people may alter or abolish a government that has become tyrannical.\n\n&gt;The United States shall be a republic.\n\n&gt;A constitution should be structured to permanently protect the people from the human frailties of their rulers.\n\n&gt;Life and liberty is secure so long as the right to property is secure.\n\n&gt;The highest level of prosperity occurs when there is a free market economy and minimum of government \nregulations.\n\n&gt;The government should be separated into three branches—legislative, executive and judicial.\n\n&gt;A system of checks and balances should be adopted to prevent the abuse of power.\n\n&gt;The unalienable rights of the people are most likely to be preserved if the principles of government are set forth in \na written constitution.\n\n&gt;Only limited and carefully defined powers should be delegated to the government, all others being retained by the people.\n\n&gt;Efficiency and dispatch require government to operate according to the will of the majority, but constitutional provisions must be made to protect the rights of the minority.\n\n&gt;Strong local self-government is the keystone to preserving human freedom.\n\n&gt;A free people should be governed by law and not by the whims of man.\n\n&gt;A free society cannot survive as a republic without a broad program of general education.\n\n&gt;A free people will not survive unless they remain strong.\n\n&gt;Peace, commerce and honest friendship with all nations—entangling alliances with none.\n\n&gt;The core unit that determines the strength of any society is the family; therefore, the government should foster and protect its integrity.\n\n&gt;The burden of debt is as destructive to freedom as subjugation by conquest.\n\n&gt;The United States has a manifest destiny to be an example and a blessing to the entire human race.\n\n&gt;To have liberty requires duty.\n\nI'm not going to R5 most if these in great detail, but many of them were either marginal improvements over the UK system or were rights that only existed on paper during the first 50+ years of American history. See this paragraph from the summary:\n\n&gt;The Founders came from many different religions, and some no religion. They were all well-read. The thinking of Polybius, Cicero, Thomas Hooker, Coke, Montesquieu, Blackstone, John Locke, and Adam Smith garnished their writings and conversations. They were careful students of the Bible, especially the Old Testament. They read historical material from a broad view of history including Greek, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, European, and English. This shared academic experience unified them in their fundamental values.\n\nThe American system of government wasn't some miraculous leap so much as it was a synthesis and improvement from the English, French, Greco-Roman, and Judeo-Christian tradition. Bonus points go to the Wiki editor for implying that Greek, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, European, and English history are separate (hint: if s/he had just written European history then s/he wouldn't have been missing anything).\n\n*additional R5s of the list of principles are welcomed and will be edited in and rewarded with upvotes.*",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4g4nd5/the_revolutionary_war_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/",
        "text": "Submitted for your approval, one person who, in their earnest opinion, believes that... well, I'll let you see for yourself:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/yr7Ucre.jpg \n\nConsidering the brevity of the submission in question, I'll break this down into two sections. Since this isn't about their poor understanding of modern laws (there is currently no death sentence for tax evasion), I'll focus on the former statement. To start:\n&gt; \"Pay 3% taxes or die\"   \n\nThe bad history here is just immense. Right here, I'll focus on this statement in itself, I'll get to the motivations of the Revolutionary War a little later.\n\nThere were many taxes that played a key role in sparking the Revolutionary War, so let's come first, to the Stamp Act.  This tax required certain stamps be purchased for a multitude of services, for anything from attorney's licenses to playing cards. However, the price of these stamps varied from item to item, and so was not 3%. Furthermore, it was repealed ten years before 1776, though it did set in motion events that lead to the Revolutionary War.\n\nNext up, the Townshend Acts, specifically, the tax on tea. Unfortunately, there seems to be quite a bit of confusion surrounding this, and although others also have at some point been told it was 3%, that doesn't seem to be the case. We'll use the following figure, provided in *The Colonial Merchants and the American Revolution, 1763-1776.*\n\n&gt;  the three-penny tea tax in America\n\n*However,* due to the extreme difficulty of finding this information, and the fact that there really isn't a number agreed upon by historians, I'll move from this to a more important focus. Also, before we move on, I'd like to point out that history is even more sketchy on the penalty for evading taxes, though I'm willing to believe that it was death, due to the... liberal usage of that penalty at the time. Regardless:\n\n&gt; 1776: Fuck you.\n\nAlright, so, first of all, the big problem here is that, there were numerous reasons for rebelling. The primary reason actually was taxation, **HOWEVER**, it was taxation *without representation*. Although, it might be better to say \"adequate representation\", because some would claim that Benjamin Franklin was instructed to reject offers for representation while in London. Though, this was because the representation they would give us might as well be equivalent to no representation at all.\n\nLastly, there were much more complex reasons we rebelled. Sure, taxes stoked the flames, but just looking at the number of contributing factors, such as the Boston Massacre, the Intolerable Acts; not to mention, the numerous... theories, not as well supported by historical evidence, it's a gross oversimplification to say that we rebelled because of a 3% tax. Also, I sincerely apologize for this wall of text.\n\n**tl;dr** Even if the tax imposed by Britain *was* 3% (jury's still out on that one), there were countless other factors leading to the American Revolution, many I didn't even mention.\n\nSources:\nMostly, Wikipedia, and the articles for the [Stamp Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamp_Act_1765) and the [Townshend Acts.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townshend_Acts)\n\nAdditionally, as mentioned above, *The Colonial Merchants and the American Revolution, 1763-1776*, by Arthur M. Schlesinger (Sr.).\n\n\nAgain, sorry about the wall of text. I sincerely hope you enjoyed this, although I'm afraid that I might have done this awfully, as this is my first badhistory post.",

I won't even address the comparison with radical Islam, I don't want to lose so much IQ points at once.\n\nSo how do we define Nazism ? I don't think you have to be a card-carrying member of the National-Socialist German Worker's Party  to be considered a Nazi. Many people believed in the völkisch racial theories that formed the platform of the Nazis. So let's take Hitler's results in elections. We can safely assume that if you vote for Hitler in the 30's in Germany, you're probably a Nazi.\n\nLet's just remind everyone of the numbers : the NSDAP got 18% of the vote in the September 1930 federal elections, 37% in July 1932 and 33% in November 1932. That's 6, 13 and 11 millions votes, respectively. So that's way higher than the claimed 7%, and this is even before Hitler came to power. And what about the 4 millions members of the SA, who actively participated in street violence for political purpose ?\n\nNow, the [picture](https://i.sli.mg/On9QmW.png) uses the year 1940 for this claim. At this time, the so-called *Gleichschaltung* (synchronization) of the society and the State by the Nazis was finished. Social-democrats and Jews were barred from being public servants, and most communists were already in concentration camps such as Dachau. The propaganda efforts of the regime **was** effective ; though there was no free elections anymore, it is safe to assume that actually, more people were Nazis at that time. Resistance was stumped out in 1940 in Germany, and Hitler was widely regarded as the hero of the German people.\n\nThen there is [this shit](http://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4ft4rs/just_a_reminder_curt_schilling_posted_this/d2budsz).\n\nSeriously. \n\n&gt;Dumb people think that all Nazis were evil. Anyone with a bit of wisdom realizes that the majority of Nazis, dare I say the vast majority, were what we would call decent people. \n\nSure, agreeing with Hitler's call for openly violent and murderous policies, and actually voting for him, is \"being decent\". \n\nA vote for the NSDAP was, to my eyes, a clear sign that one was not \"decent\". It meant, for a large part, agreeing to the national-socialist platform. And then there is the lack of protest against the antisemitic laws such as the Nuremberg laws of 1935, that made Jews second-class citizens in the Reich. There was little to no protest against the *Kristallnacht*, the massive state-sponsored November 9, 1938 pogrom. There was no protest against the unlawful aggression of Poland, and so on... I think saying that \"most Nazis were actually decent\" is actually a terrible understanding of Germany's contemporary History.\n\nAND THEN SOMEONE POSTS A GODDAMN PHOTO OF WEHRMACHT SOLDIERS WITH A KITTEN.\n\n&gt; Had I spoke German and been around back then, I probably would have gotten along with most Nazis. \n\n\n&gt;Yet these words are practically treasonous by modern standards, because we've become too stupid/afraid to think for ourselves. \n\n\nSeriously. They liked kittens, they could not have been that bad, right ? Nevermind the concentration camps, the ghettos, the Einsatzgruppen, the death camps. \n\n\n&gt;Most of the ''evil'' Nazis were the ones in the SS. They're the sick ones who experimented on Jews. The ones who were just in the Wehrmacht were definitely mostly just regular soldiers.\n\n\nThe \"clean Wehrmacht Myth\" is, well, a really big myth. It has been continuously fought by all historians. I recommand reading *The Wehrmacht. History, Myth, Reality* bu Wolfram Wette on that subject. Most soldiers actually killed Jews when commanded to do so, and so did most of the Order Police (You can read Christopher Browning's *Ordinary Men: Reserve Police battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland*).\n\n\n\n\nI feel the urge to finish this first post of mine on the subreddit by a little [glimpse of sanity](http://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4ft4rs/just_a_reminder_curt_schilling_posted_this/d2bz1xr) in the thread.\n\n\nSorry for the low-hanging fruit, but this was just too tempting. Also sorry for the bad english :(\n\nEdit : I also fucked up the title, I meant to say x-post to /r/ShitWehraboosSay...",
