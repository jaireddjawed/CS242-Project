There are a couple of businesses who do this a few times a year around me.\nThere is obviously just whatever colors there that are leftover, and some are definitely wild. But today I picked up multiple buckets of plain white enamel for trim that were 3/4 full, a fun blue colour that was completely full, and a few buckets that were at least half full of neutral wall colours. And because it's a professional painting business they are really high quality paints.\n\nIt's definitely worth looking to see if this is an option anywhere in your area. Call around! So far I've paid for pretty much no paint for my entire house.\n\nAlso, if you are a wallpaper person, check your thrift stores. I've found dozens of rolls of the same wallpaper in thrift stores!",

The last time I moved for some reason CU didn't want to accept any code for my account number, so I decided to shop around and found someone mentioning Super Value Checks, so I decided I'd give it a try. \n\nWell, I got the envelope today. **These checks from SVC just scream cheap and low quality**. I think I had printing quality that poor on my old uncalibrated inkjet printer some time in 1997. It's SO striking that I [scanned both checks side-by-side at 600dpi](https://postimg.cc/z3Csc4QH) just to show the difference. Crispy sharp lines and most likely magnetic ink for check numbers on my old ones and bad quality printing on my new ones. \n\nAnd... don't get me wrong - in this day and age when everyone is just snapping the check image with their phone, either check would work perfectly. They just look lousy and cheap.\n\nLesson learned though. **If you order checks from Super Value Checks, know that the print quality will be very bad**.\n\n*P.S. I am in no way affiliated with either companies. As a matter of fact, I hate paper checks, but that's the easiest way to pay for the loan at my local credit union, so I have to have some.*",

As often, what seems as a comedy sketch reveals so much about who we are. \n\nI have never seen much sense in buying up gobs of stuff just because it was a good deal. Or keeping things that I may or may not need someday if I had no specific purpose for it. - I always have been quick to unload those “maybe” items, because I asked myself if the cost of keeping it was worth the $100 I may waste in the rare event of needing to go buy a duplicate of something I gave away to goodwill last year….\n\nI have heard many people discuss storage space when they purchase a new home. They may want the big closets, garage with cabinets along the wall, even bonus room for storage. They even justify purchasing the home because of it’s storage space. (Very a la George Carlin😉) \n\nSo I just googled and did some math…. The average purchase price of a home in the US was $169 per square foot. Assuming we are just buying an extra 10x10 sq ft area to store our stuff, that stuff better be worth over $16,900.        …Are we really using it to hold $16k of stuff? Are the taxes we are paying annually on that really saving us money? And let’s not look at the interest paid on that money if you are paying interest on a mortgage. \n\nAnd that 16k is really just an average, in many places, that 100 sq ft is costing 25k or more. \n\nIt this really being frugal?

I need the frugal community’s help insulating our apartment and keeping warm. I am going to pick up some window film later to insulate and seal all windows. Maybe door sweeps too? We have plenty of flannel and Sherpa lined blankets, hoodies and thermals. I also read about reversing the direction of ceiling fans. \n\nAny other suggestions of frugal ways to stay warm?",

But sometimes the sheer cost is still overwhelming, especially now that I'm trying to help support my sister who recently became a single mother and has zero resources besides WIC. (She often runs out before her WIC renews and it's hard for her to make ends meet even with two jobs. The baby's father moved out of state and doesn't support his son whatsoever. My family has experienced generations of poverty and my mother is really only able to help in terms of babysitting so that my sister can work.)\n\nEven then, where my sister lives is even worse in terms of the formula shortage compared to where I live. Sometimes the stores in her state are completely out of stock for shipping to her place.\n\nWhat is everyone else doing to keeps costs down for formula? I only buy brand name Enfamil is the store/generic is out of stock, but it's been like that for a few months now since generic formula goes out of stock almost immediately after a shipment comes in. I'm open to ideas on how to be more frugal about this. I feel like formula wasn't as hard to come by and afford years ago when I had my first child.\n\n(My youngest can only take the Gentlease formula but my nephew takes the regular yellow can of Enfamil.)",

This isn’t meant to look down on anyone on the show or anyone who lives like this, I honestly wish I had that kind of self restraint. However I’ve watched a few episodes where people have habits that I feel like don’t really save money or at least could find better options.\n\nFor example I just watched the episode where the woman’s boyfriend wants her to get an actual bed instead of using her air mattress. She says a new bed will cost her $1,000 so she buys two heavily stained mattresses for $8 each. I feel like people give away mattresses or at least sell them (not for $8) often on Craigslist. I see free mattresses on CL all the time, I feel like that would have been a better option. For such a frugal person: how does she not own a sewing kit for easy repairs? She buys fabric scraps and duct tapes them together. \n\nAnother episode shows a family who uses paper plates covered in plastic wrap. Wouldn’t the cost of plastic wrap outweigh the cost of just buying more paper plates?\n\nAnother episode has a guy who runs his hot tub to use for showers/dishes/laundry. Hot tubs aren’t known to be cheap and I’m assuming the cost of running that is high.\n\nAnyone up for discussion? (Also like I said looking for show recommendations) :)",

        "text": "Minimalism lends well to frugalism in a lot of ways. Buying less stuff = spending less shit maintaining and housing and moving your stuff. But there are other ways they conflict. Over at r/decluttering I see an attitude of 'if it's cheap and can easily be replaced then let it go'. The issue is that, \n\n1. I'm trying to save every dollar and I don't wanna rebuy stuff.\n2. even cheap stuff continues to increase in cost while value drops. It used to be easy to go to thrift shops and get a quality wool sweater for a few dollars and there'd be a whole rack of them. That's now a distant dream. I don't think there's going to be an endless supply of quality crockpots from the 70s going for a few dollars, ya know?\n\nSometimes people give me hand-me-downs that will be useful in future that I'd have to store. Also buying in bulk has benefits. You can save so much money if you have the foresight to buy stuff on sale in advance and store it for when you next need it. Then there are things you use only occasionally but that saves a lot of money and hassle to have handy. I don't like asking to borrow from other people - what if I accidentally damage it? I value being independent and I don't like feeling like Im asking lots of favours or owe people. People around me don't live the same frugal lifestyle so it's not like I'm in a reciprocal lending arrangement with the people around me. Borrowing and lending with strangers off the internet is above my risk limit. I'm also a busy person, I often don't have time or energy for sourcing things on the occasional basis that I need them. \n\nAnd then there is the issue of actually disposing of stuff when decluttering. It feels like an ethical challenge because I hate  waste and I hate contributing to landfill. I know that a lot of what goes to opshops/thrift stores ends up landfill too, so I use that as a last resort. I feel good knowing stuff is going to a friend or colleague that will use it. Selling it ensures it's going to someone that wants it but takes time and effort. I've joined Freecycle and my local Buy Nothing groups but they are pretty quiet in my city/Australia.\n\nAnyone else having these challenges?",
