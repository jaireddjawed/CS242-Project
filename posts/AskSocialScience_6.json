It was just so long ago, I have no chance of recalling it or tracking down anything I wrote about it.\n\nAs I remember it, bureaucracies proliferate for two reasons. The reason I'm less interested in is that they are like laws against things that simply can't be stopped, like drug use or illicit sex. The other reason, of much more importance to me, has more to do with the endless need for social service agencies to document that they are only  serving people who are \"deserving\"/meet the regulations.  This is where I get fuzzy, and I've been inside of social service agencies. As I barely remember it, because the rule seeks to define something that changes constantly, the forms always have to be refiled...but that's not exactly correct. Or it could have had something to do with how rewarding being dis-advantaged incentivizes lying about one's income or making as little as possible (this is more like reason #1) so that while the goal may be economic self sufficiency, the actual outcome is to encourage dependence. I really don't think I have it correct. It think it had more to do with endless regulations and why they're necessary. All comments welcome.",

        "text": "I’m old enough to remember the olden days (pre-internet) and my subjective recollection is that we, as a society, were a whole lot nicer to each other before the internet came around.  Or at least more civil.   I believe that part of this is due to the easy anonymity of the internet enabling people’s less civil sides to emerge.   \n\nLooking for books and/or articles that discuss this idea in more depth, even if they disagree with my supposition.  But something that focuses on the last 30-40 years and ideally includes the emergence of the internet as part of their exploration.  \n\nMy only requirement is that the material is largely objective with no obvious biases/axes to grind.   More Of a scientific study vs a political narrative.  And something easy/enjoyable to read would be a bonus.  \n\nI checked the book list on the wiki, but didn’t see anything.  \n\nThanks!",

How can one reply to such a question fully when the question itself is problematic? All types of determinisms, whether from the natural or social sicences are trash, If we had exact explanations for all human behaviour means we'd be stuck in them, the fact that we can take a distance from behaviour, from ours and others means we're already past those determinations. Saying x gene makes one more likely to comit crime or growing up in poverty makes one more likely to comit crime is not enough, they are just empirical correlations, that could never explain why people growing with similar genetic build and similar circumstances might arrive to diferente thoughts and actions (even if they share a lot of similarities). \n\n",

        "text": "Maybe it's just me, but it often seems like secular liberals in the US have cultivated a willful blind spot about the extent to which mainstream US culture writ large has been profoundly shaped by the influence of conservative Protestant Christianity. Especially within the kinds of discourses where the shared ideological self-conception involves a certain baseline commitment to racial and gender equality, the tendency seems to be to \"otherize\" right-wing Christian values as belonging either to the distant mists of history (e.g. studying the early Puritan settlement in New England without trying to comprehend how this history might influence the present) or to a narrow evangelical subculture whose values are depicted as sharply distinct from the broader society (e.g. a documentary like *Jesus Camp* that almost seems to take the tone of an anthropological excursion into the Amazon).\n\nI'm interested if anybody has any obvious recommendations for scholarship that examines US Protestantism both as a profoundly living phenomenon that shapes US culture even today, and a profoundly mainstream phenomenon shaping even aspects of US culture that like to imagine themselves as thoroughly secularized. For example, has anybody taken a focused look at the Christian roots of often innocuous-seeming movements like \"positive psychology\" or \"attachment parenting\", say as a critical intellectual biography of figures like Norman Vincent Peale or William Sears? Has anybody done a deep dive into the use of Christianity as a framing device for mainstream political currents like Cold War anticommunism, or for '70s- and '80s-era mainstream pushback against civil rights and feminism? Obviously I'm thinking mostly about the dominant WASP culture here, but the influence of religious conservatism as a moderating force in marginalized nonwhite and/or non-Protestant communities could also fall within the scope of the question, especially anything about the cross-pollination of conservative Christian ideology across racial or denominational lines.\n\nI realize it may be an impossibly vague and broad question, but it seems like the kind of issue for which someone out there (especially a US-based social scientist raised in a conservative Christian environment before entering the world of secular liberal academia as an adult) might grok exactly what I'm going for and have a set of literature recommendations burning a hole in their pocket.",

I've read Nietzsche and then morals became very interesting to me, altough that made me often nihilistic in my moral positions. It's very frustrating but I face it as a necessary evil to have a better understanding about the existence of being. Now politics is becomming more and more yelling.\n\nIf you know my country situation, you may know that it's chaotic. We live in a huge economic crisis, corruption schemes are becoming more and more evident. Corrupt politicians are judged and arrested, then a few months later they are released. Our ex president Lula is arrested, but compete is still a possibility for him and he has the majority of voting intentions. The main opositor supports torture, consecrates the military dictatorship we had in the history of our country and he's a machine gun of ignorance. \n\nOn one side I see the new age girl with tons of bought arguments saying only women can speak on abortion and only black people can speak on racism. On the other side there's the ones who say  \"a good bandit is a dead bandit\" and that everything is a communist conspiracy.\n\nI've watched a few thinkers on the internet to give me a few insights but when I hear or see people saying what I mentioned before in such a simplistic and convincing way it just pisses me off. I know they don't understand anything they're doing or talking about, but I can't position myself because I don't know either, I can't articulate my thinking because I don't really understand it. I think I can't judge them by what they're feeling, they might have their reasons, but I know they're just wrong on their thinking. \n\nSo, about the thinkers I've seen on internet, this video (https://youtu.be/1r3H9--2nS0) set me a goal and brought me here. What's the path to see the big picture like them? What's the path to see the whole? To understand? To make constructive questions and constructive arguments? Which books should I read? Can you recommend them for me? Do you have a bibliographic list? Do you know where should I look for it? A site, a sub or anything?\n\nIf You guys help me I'd be really grateful!

        "text": "If so, what is the justification?\n\nThree primary reasons people are sent to SAE are 1) clear evidence of addiction, 2) arrest for possession of illegal drugs, and 3) failing a drug test (often mandated by an employer).  \n\nAlcohol abuse education often follows a DUI.  People also enter the programs after evaluation:  How often do you drink?  How much?  Drink alone?  Does your drinking affect your work performance?  Affect personal relationships? Etc.  Possession of alcohol, observed drinking--not factors.\n\nA person arrested for drugs has a *legal problem.*   Failed employee drug test equals a *work problem.*   Is there a presumption of a substance abuse from the first two items?  Does SAE operate with an orientation different from alcohol abuse education?\n\nAn insight comes from Portugal's model for drug use.  Excerpt:\n\n&gt;Today, Portuguese authorities don't arrest anyone found holding what's considered less than a 10-day supply of an illicit drug — a gram of heroin, ecstasy, or amphetamine, two grams of cocaine, or 25 grams of cannabis. Instead, drug offenders receive a citation and are ordered to appear before so- called \"dissuasion panels\" made up of legal, social, and psychological experts. Most cases are simply suspended. Individuals who repeatedly come before the panels may be prescribed treatment....\n\nhttps://news.vice.com/article/ungass-portugal-what-happened-after-decriminalization-drugs-weed-to-heroin\n\nA *dissuasion panel.*  The term *dissuasion* is highly germane to this topic.  What are the respective roles of *dissuasion* in SAE and alcohol abuse education?  Do they differ?\n\nAnd how does the vexing question of what constitutes *use* versus *abuse* factor in?  Is the distinction equally accepted by both models? \n\nPossibly relevant:  Some law enforcement agencies have long operated *drug diversion programs*  (much improved since the reefer madness days.)   These programs are generally overt about their agenda: drug avoidance.  Would we characterize these programs as *education?*   How would be compare such drug diversion programs with SAE?\n\n- - - - -\n\nFN:  If the story is accurate, Portugal is treating cannabis users more strictly than U.S. states that have legalized marijuana.  We can probably surmise that Portugal is exceedingly lenient on cannabis cases, but mandatory appearance before a *dissuasion panel?*  \n\nWhat conclusion is drawn if someone doesn't want to appear before the panel?  Might that be defiance, possibly because a person takes offense to being presumed to have an addiction? \n\n\n",
