It's not possible. There's a point at which the gravity of the planet can not longer bind the atmosphere to the planet. If this point is crossed, the atmosphere has reached its max. mass and can not gain anymore mass.\n\n2. It's possible. There's no thing such as a point of maximum atmospheric mass. The moment the atmosphere gets more massive than the planet itself, gravity reverses and starts pulling upward.\n\n3. We don't know.

        "text": "*** looking for links / directions to bodies of work or related literature ***\n\nIs there a body of work out there looking into how information is stored / represented in the human brain?  Is the \"way\" this information is represented unique to the individual's brain or is most of the structure of the representation shared among all human brains (ex, how an image is represented)?  I have been wondering how our representations of information in computer systems compare to the way that the brain represents the same information.\n\n1. When I read the word \"cat,\" my eyes take in the raw light stimulus (level 1), piece together patterns in the light/colors to form characters (level 2) and then these characters are combined to form a word (stage 3) which my brain abstracts to my high level understanding of what a cat *is*.\n2. When I hear the word \"cat,\" my ears process raw sound waves (level 1), piece together patterns in the sound waves/frequencies to form syllables (level 2) and then these syllables are combined to form a word (stage 3) which my brain then abstracts to the same understanding of what a cat *is* as when I read the word.\n3. When I see a picture of a cat, my eyes process the raw light stimulus (level 1), piece together patterns in the light/colors to form visual features (level 2) and then these visual features are combined into an image representation of a cat (level 3) which my brain then abstracts to the same understanding of what a cat *is* as when I read or hear the related word.\n\nMy brain is able to transform the information stored in the character sequence c-a-t, the sound of someone saying \"cat,\" and the image of the cat to the same high level representation of a cat.  Similarly, I can transform my high level representation of a cat to the character sequence c-a-t, the sound of saying \"cat,\" or draw an image of a cat.  (side thought, the first two are English dependent whereas the image is language independent)\n\nIf I had a computer/BMI hooked up to my brain, (theoretically) could I transfer this high level representation (level 3) of a cat in my brain to a computer in some format and then later directly load/transform the representation to the same representation of the high level entity in my brain (skipping levels 1&amp;2 from the three above approaches)?  Would that artificial high level representation mean anything to a different person / would it be transferable?\n\nFurthermore, I could imagine a higher level representation (level 4) of concepts that are combinations of level 3 representations such as the meaning of a passage of text, a spoken sentence, or sequence of images.  If a futuristic [neuralink](https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html)-like technology were to exist where two humans could communicate complex ideas without having to translate the idea to a crude and inefficient medium (text, sound, image, etc), it would have to somehow translate the high level concept in my brain into a format/representation that is interpretable by a different human's brain.\n\nI am no expert on any of this, and am interested in any related work or explanations.\n\nOriginally Posted: [https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/8jq8qp/how_is_information_represented_in_the_human_brain/](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/8jq8qp/how_is_information_represented_in_the_human_brain/)",

        "text": "I recently had an idea for a story that revolves around a host server that provides a service to users all over the globe, regardless of nationality or influence. To make things fluid the story will be set at a point where a universal translator has been mostly worked out between the major world languages. I'm here at /r/asksciencediscussion because I only know the bare basics of how the internet works and how one can protect their servers from outside influence. In order to tell this story properly I need to make sure the science is reasonably sound when explaining how this secret server (or servers, more likely) was built and maintained.\n\nThe servers are essentially offering a service of sorts that none of the major world governments are happy with. They consider this server farm and its custodians a threat to their authority, and are constantly trying to shut it down by any means necessary. The custodians are not malicious, and have never openly attacked a threat unless it was in self defense. For reference assume that the custodians have a significant amount of resources and manpower available to assist with this endeavor. Enough to rival a Fortune 500 conglomerate even.\n\nSo here is the ultimate question: How would you design these servers to be impenetrable to consistent attacks from all of the major world governments? What means of attack would you predict, and how would you evade or neutralize these threats? I realize this is a nigh impossible task, but I'm not afraid to throw a little pseudoscience or future science in to make things more believable. One of my ideas was basing the host servers themselves somewhere underwater like Bioshock's Rapture, but I'm not sure if that would be reasonable under the circumstances.",

        "text": "[Math's unsolved problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_mathematics#Combinatorics) can lack any solution. Legal problems differ in kind: solutions always exist but must compete with, and be selected from, other solutions. \n\nFeel free to critique the 3 reasons beneath. But are there other explanations?\n\n###1. [Math is logical and rigorous. But law is ambiguous and depends on natural language.](https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/8ilwq0/whys_math_more_abstruse_to_learn_than_law/dysu922/)\n\n&gt;The thing with Mathematics is that every single step must be an airtight, logically valid transformation. Law, insofar it is based on the hot mess that natural language is, is anything but rigorous. The language itself is highly ambiguous at every step of the way, the ideas described only make any sense in the context of \"common sense\" for that given culture (which is implicit in the natural language itself) and humanity as a whole, and everything is hilariously ad hoc (the fact that things such as \"interpreting the law\" or \"legal precedent\" are things *at all* is hard proof)\n\n&gt;Basically, imagine trying to do something as \"simple\" as defining what a person is[,] with the level of rigor that would be expected in Mathematics. It's probably impossible even in principle, because persons aren't fundamental entities of the universe, but just a useful heuristic rule of thumb we use -- think of how you're constantly shedding and creating new cells, how \"analogically\" a person's life ends and begins, edge cases like conjoined twins... in law, at best you'd have a very rough definition that attempts to close off a few obvious loopholes, while the unwritten premise behind the law is \"you f[__]king know what a person is, come on\". But you don't. You're allowed to get away with such gross shortcuts because it wouldn't be practical otherwise [...], and that's why it's easy for a layperson to grasp[. A]ll they need is a rough understanding of the matter and to be able to make roughly correct inferences from it.\n\n&gt;[[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/8im372/whys_math_more_abstruse_to_learn_than_law/dyt29hp/) :] [M]ath can get highly abstract and eventually you reach a point where things are no longer intuitively obvious and they have to be just accepted the first time you learn them. It happens to everyone, depending on how good your mathematical intuition you may struggle early on or do fairly well even in college. Nobody can intuitively understand all of mathematics, or even a small subset, because you're competing with thousands, perhaps millions of other mathematicians, and unless you are brilliant enough to produce something original, you're essentially just trying to understand what greater minds than you have produced. There is no limit to how abstract or hypothetical maths can get, as long as you have proved something new that wasn't obvious to others it is considered useful and an addition to the existing body of knowledge.\n\n&gt;Law does not get that abstract. Law does not consider how hypothetical crimes (such as say ... time travel?) are handled, it only considers a subject worthy of study if it is practically relevant. There is a limit to how complex real-life situations usually get. Also that most laws are based on our own instincts and common sense. Which is why human judges or some form of human law will be required even after superintelligent AI is a thing. Human values are vague and contradictory, and the reason why law will never have hard-coded theorems since ultimately only what we feel to be right is right.\n\n###2. [Math operates within a framework of axioms defined by the universe. The law operates within a framework of axioms defined by humans.](https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/8ilwq0/whys_math_more_abstruse_to_learn_than_law/dyu0400/)\n\n[Law is artificial, whose rules match the average person's understanding. Math abstractly describes reality, and can't be guaranteed to be intuitive to the average person.](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/8a66ai/why_is_math_so_complicated_and_hard/dwwbgog/)\n\n###3. Artificial and based on common sense, law [\"can be learned by relentless memorizing\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/8ilwq0/whys_math_more_abstruse_to_learn_than_law/). But math can only be learned by understanding concepts. \n\n[Evolution may explain why learning law is easier](https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/8hjf6p/why_is_math_more_complex_difficult_than_law/dykd29h),  as\n\n&gt;humans have needed a sense of justice for as long as their ancestors have been living in groups, which is millions of years. On the other hand, math has only been important for survival for the last 10,000 years. So it’s natural that average humans haven't mastered math. A sense of justice helped ancient humans and human ancestors survive more than understanding the Pythagorean theorem would have.\n\n\n\n",
