I am curious how long from start to finish it would have taken to create a hummus that we would recognize today, in say, the 1400s.\n",

Does anyone know how much of this was introduced to Native Americans by Europeans and how much was their own creation?

        "text": "Hello, AskFoodHistorians! As the title said, I'm a writer; right now I'm working on a piece about family holiday traditions that uses a cake my family made every Christmas as a metaphor/jumping off point. The thing is, this cake does not seem to exist outside of my family. I have contacted older members, and they all remember my great-grandmother saying it was a \"traditional German dessert.\" The recipe card written in her hand says \"gesplichter,\" but her memoirs say \"gasplichter.\" The internet has turned up nothing in those spellings, or anything even close. I've contacted a food historian I've worked with before, and nothing. Here's what I know about it:\n\nHer parents were German immigrants; she lived in Hiawatha, Kansas for her entire life.\nIt's a sponge cake made with a ton of butter and a ton of eggs (like, 14 eggs.) The cake is then sliced into small strips and rebuilt, with a cocoa icing (that uses raw egg yolks) acting as mortar. When sliced, the cake either looks like a brick wall or a checkerboard--her original recipe says she doesn't know how to make the checkerboard one, though. She said she'd ask her neighbors, but it looks like that never happened.\n\nI'm happy to type up the full recipe if that would help, but does any of this ring any bells with anyone? Does it remind you of any other recipe? Are there any qualities that suggest its origin? Did she just make it up (my aunt feels this is unlikely)? Any help is much appreciated.\n\nUPDATE: I have just heard from my great-grandmother's great-granddaughter (my grandmother's niece, so I guess my first cousin once removed? Anyway) She was taught to make the cake by my great-grandmother and it turns out she learned it from a neighbor from RUSSIA. It's not even GERMAN. Does this help any? I still don't see any Russian desserts matching the description.)",

Despite being an accepted fact by many, it's also demonstrably false - England has a very rich food culture, great restaurants, and a lot of food that's trendy in America right now (e.g. \"gastro-pub\" style food) is heavily influenced by British food. Most people just seem to believe British food is bad because they've been told that so many times. But where does this belief come from historically?",
