        "text": "The order of events:\n\nIt all began when the person who runs Mema Interretialia, a tumblr that translates memes into Latin, translated “I can’t sleep because I slept all day” as “Dormire non possum quia per totum diem dormiebam.”: http://interretialia.tumblr.com/post/57418766729/dormire-non-possum-quia-per-totum-diem\n\nFelipe Canever, whose first language is Portuguese and is therefore familiar with the Romance aspect system, points out that “slept” should be in the perfect tense (“dormivi”), not the imperfect tense (“dormiebam”). This is met with a completely wrong explanation for why it should be the latter: http://interretialia.tumblr.com/post/57426337021/in-dormire-non-possum-quia-per-totum-diem\n\nFelipe tries again, with the same result: http://interretialia.tumblr.com/post/57435515969/portuguese-is-my-mother-language-and-we-use-eu\n\nFelipe finally decides to consult a Latin forum, where literally everybody agrees that it should be “dormivi”: http://latindiscussion.com/forum/latin/perfect-vs-imperfect-tense.18138/\n\nEverybody, that is, except for the aforementioned tumblr user, who joined the discussion under the name Diaphanus and resolutely refuses to admit any mistake, acting like a pompous know-it-all (“So far, I haven't seen a particularly strong case here that the perfect is better than the imperfect in the relevant context.”): http://latindiscussion.com/forum/latin/perfect-vs-imperfect-tense.18138/#post-156805\n\nHe also wrote a tumblr post about that thread in which he acts as if a user who didn’t agree with him (Pacis puella) agreed with him: http://interretialia.tumblr.com/post/83405347410/dormiebam-et-dormivi-dormiebam-and\n\nTwo days later, another native speaker of Portuguese tries to talk some sense into him. He keeps up his pompous tone (“I think I’ve shown pretty clearly that it wouldn’t be *dormivi*.”) and maintains that his arguments for why the perfect tense is wrong only apply to Latin and not to other languages that make the same distinction between perfect and imperfect, because reasons: http://interretialia.tumblr.com/post/83597729042/about-the-domiebam-x-dormivi-subject-im-a\n\nInterestingly, in a later translation he used the perfect tense in the same grammatical construction (he translated “We have done nothing productive all day” as “Per totum diem nihil productivum fecimus” rather than “Per totum diem nihil productivum faciebamus”). When asked (by me, I hope this doesn’t violate the “Don’t submit threads you posted in” rule), he gave a BS explanation for why the imperfect tense was correct then, but the perfect tense was correct now: http://interretialia.tumblr.com/post/89419064118/tomsfox-interretialia-interretialia-per\n\nIt’s like he *knows* he made a mistake the first time around but just can’t admit it.",

But that's not the important part.\n\nI'd like to speculate about how English learners in Asia should focus on achieving a communicable level of English education and not stress over the minute points of grammar, because as the language continues to evolve in different areas of the world, usages will change drastically.\n\nAn example I can think of off the top of my head is Koreans adopting English words for their own purposes, but this isn't really grammar.\n\nAnother possible example I can think of is English in the Philippines. But I'm having trouble thinking of specific examples right now.\n\nAnother thing I can think of is Shakespearean-era English having archaic features not present in modern English (yes I am aware people did not speak like Shakey wrote).\n\nThis is meant to be a short presentation! So ideally the example should be something quite simple. What do you think?\n\nSorry if this doesn't belong here... I am most confident in the people on this subreddit, that's all. Thanks!\n\n#EDIT: Just a shoutout to why I love this subreddit much more than /r/linguistics: I received actual replies here, chummy banter, and very helpful input on a fairly interesting topic.
