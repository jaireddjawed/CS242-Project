        "text": "  Well, I suppose i should begin at the beginning, and why I was able to meet Homer at all. And  if you get down to it it means this tale starts with a heart attack, and it goes something like this;\n\nI used to own my own general contracting company with about 5 employees and even had a radio commercial(played once at 2am. Worst $300 I ever spent). Well, one day my DNA caught up to me and I had a heart attack in the middle of a job, and dragged my feinting dying arse to the front lawn out of the back 4 acres lot I was planting trees on and flopped down to wait for death or emt's whichever got there first. \n   \nNeedless to say, it spelled the end of the business for me as I was not able to continue the work I was doing and could not rely upon the employees I had to keep it all going, so business tanked and I had to find something that I could putter around at that wouldn't stress me while I healed. That's where the local Dollar Holler down the road and a simple job being a professional NPC came into the picture, and my eventual introduction to Homer.\n\nI started as a simple shelf stocker. Nice easy mindless work where I could just putter around it a little warm cloud of thought, or sometimes just the blissful Zen of no thought, just experiencing sensation and the eternal moment of now.  I'd notice a  quickly fading wispy misty swirl in the air when I'd turn around sometimes and knowing the way of such things I just let it be as I felt nothing untoward. But after I settled in for a few days the employees there did the inevitable pack bonding thing and started to tell me about Homer, once they were comfortable in my chill.  I listened(so did Homer) with an open mind (as I've done seent a thing or 2) to their tales and of course told a few of my own as is the custom. Apparently Homer was listening too.\n\nWell he started to test my metal. The first time I had a major Homer incident was one evening stocking pet food. I heard the unmistakable WHAM BAM BALAMBA BAM! of a number of boxes falling one aisle over. I figured it was a customer that made an oopsie so I walked into the aisle to survey the damage. Nothing. No customer, no boxes, just a clean empty aisle. \"Huh\" I said sagely and scratched my beard. WHAM BAM BALAMBA BAM! again, same avalanche of loaded cardboard boxes sound with accompanying floor thump, 2 aisles the other way. \"Huh\" I said. So I moseied over to see what I could see, and behold, nothing. So I rolled my eyes and told him firmly but politely to knock it off I had things to do. He did so out of courtesy and seeing as I wasn't spooked,  I could always be assured of him hanging out near me somewhere on shift after that.\n\nAfter that I went up front and talked to the young cashier and asked her if she heard anything. She got a look on her face like she wasn't sure how I was gonna react and said \"Now don't get scared but....\"and launched into her experiences\n   \nThey told me of objects moved an noises heard and a general feeling of benevolent playfulness without maliciousness. 2 of them told me about a night when they were closing up and just locking the front door when they heard a man's cough from just out of sight, one or 2 aisles in. So, being that they couldn't just lock a customer in the store they called out . No answer. And then another cough, further in. Oh boy.\nWell they had to investigate, but they sure didn't want to(2 women, late at night alone) so they grabbed a pair of box cutters and without splitting up commenced to patrolling the aisles. They kept hearing the swish of someone's clothes as they walked around, always just one aisle over. When they got to the laundry detergent, all the way in the back of the store, they figured it was a Homer game at that point and made it clear they were done and headed home. So when they turned to level, he tossed a bag of tide pods down the aisle after them, sorta giving them a goose in the Willie's. They high tailed out of there fast, I'm sure to his amusement, locked the doors and zipped home.\n\nHe'll roll a cart in front of me from a cross aisle sometimes, or play with the motion alarm by the register causing it to go off indicating a customer at the front so I'd have to stop whatever I was doing to check. I'll gently but firmly tell him to knock it off, and he would. He'd usually go play with the front door after that, just standing in the way while it would close partially, then open, then close partially on repeat until he was acknowledged.\n\nOne time not long ago I had a customer, a little old Tangina lookin' lady I'd never seen before, come to the counter unprompted and tell me casual as you please that there was something incorporeal hanging out in the store but it was benevolent and not to worry (I thanked her of course)\n\nOne evening as a friend of mine was leaving, she thought it would be cute to leave a large teddy bear on the conveyor belt holding a sign written in magic marker(red of course) that said \"I'm watching you!\" for the manager we'll call B in the morning She locked up and headed home for the night, not knowing what calamity she has set in motion. \n\nWell, Homer being the prankster saw this as a golden opportunity and set off the motion alarms through the store. The police called the manager and she said she'd be right down to deal with it, so they wrote it off without ever appearing on scene. She arrives, unlocks the door and turns on the lights and what's the first thing she sees? That frickin' bear on the conveyor with a sign writ in red ink \"I'm Watching You!\" Needless to say, it in no way seemed cute or innocent. Poor woman thought she was about to be victim #whatever in a low budget horror flick. I'm betting ol' Homer was laughing his arse off\n\nAlmost every shift he fiddles with something so that it actually feels weird if you haven't \"heard\" from him in awhile. So I let ol' Homer know I was writing this as it's only common courtesy, as I talk to him like another employee whenever he makes himself known. Current management refers to him as \"my buddy\" as im your \"your buddy was active last night, he(insert harmless story here)\". I've typed quite a bit of it on break actually and I'm sure ol' boy is reading over my shoulder right now as I feel a general air of approval as I type these words. I think Homer chills around me because of the indelible mark left behind on my soul by an entity that likes the name \"Grandma Mooses\", a vast thing from beyond that thought yanking an old settled comfortable atheist up by the soul and giving them a good shake and  a bit of a lecture/tune up/attitude adjustment was the height of comedy. And it was, I see the humor now these years on! \n  \nBut that is a tale for another time friends, another time.",

        "text": "As of now, I don’t really know what to say. I went on a walk a couple hours ago around 7 lIke I do usually to clear my head of the tiring day, this however would lead to my problem I have now. Where am I. I took a turn around Grove St. then headed towards Lilian Ln. and just as I was about to turn left on 144th street I felt something. It was that feeling of pins and needles kind of waving through me. At first I thought it was a shiver of some sort, but I think I am mistaken. As I continued to the street sign that should have marked 144th St. It looked odd to me. As I continued I had to double back realizing the street sign had now changed to 144th Parallel St. In my mind I lazily discarded it too who knows what and I honestly didn’t really want to care. I should have. As I continued on I felt a strange sensation that I was not in the right place even thought I have been in this town my whole entire life. As I continued to what should have 145th St. it just looped back to Grove St.\nI knew for a fact this loop should not be there but my mind raised red flags to what was happening so I decided to turn around and go home to which I did. When I got home all I wanted to do was sleep but something in the back of my head wanted to know what was happening. I got an idea to text my child hood friend who used to live next door. \n\nThe texts were as follows \n\nMe: hey, I know this might sound weird and all but do you ever remember there being a 145th St. in our neighborhood?\n\nHim: hi, that is a really strange question. You’ve lived there for what 15 years? What are you talking about 145th street? You good bro?\n\nMe: Yeah sorry I got it mixed up with a different road \n\nI know for a fact there has always been a 145th St. next to 144th St. and it makes sense anyways 145 comes after 154.\n\nHas anyone experienced this themselves?\nIt seems similar to the Mandela effect",

        "text": "Curious to see the stories about Australian paranormal acitivity. \nI worked in a nursing home in QLD which was built 1880’s, and have had my fair share of unexplainable experiences. One day my co-worker and I were dropping a food trolley off to the residents on the top floor wing which you had to access via an elevator. We were standing there waiting for the elevator to come down, which was when all the hallway &amp; room lights started blinging and malfunctioning like crazy, zapping sounds coming from the lights and all, then just stopped after a few seconds. The lights have never malfunctioned like this, ever, so we found it a bit odd and gave eachother a look as if to say “wtf??” but we were like whatever, probably just nothing. We proceeded to drop the trolley off and head back into the elevator and be on our way back, which was when an RN had walked past us and had told us a resident on the top floor wing we were in had actually just passed away, right when those lights started flickering. Maybe just a coincidence, I’m not sure but was definitely odd. My co-workers’ a non believer but she even said it was so strange. That’s just one story. I’m curious to hear about yours.",

I sat down with her she started to wake up and the door closed by itself. Not all the way but it was like someone pushed it. No windows open. No drafts. Eventually I worked up the courage to leave the room and shut the door all the way this time on purpose because I didn’t want to see it moved and get freaked out. She started to cry an hour later and I come up stairs and the door is open again. \n\nI’m scared, don’t know why after so long I’m having things happen. I hope it’s nothing bad.",

        "text": " I want to start by saying this story is completely true, verified by multiple accounts that all match. I also have a few memories I'll go into that match with my parents' account of events. I like to think of myself as having a reasonable amount os skepticism, but this is just something I can't explain. Also, English is not my first language and I never really studied it, I just kind of got it from movies and reading fanfic (lol) so I apologize for spelling/grammatical errors.\n\nThis happened when I was about 2-4 years old. For context, I was a chill baby. Loved sleeping and watching cartoons. I was my parents' only child at the time, my mom is a teacher and my dad is a farmer. I'd spend my days with my auntie (she babysat me) while mom and dad worked, often playing outside with the animals and sticks. I had no neighbors for miles, but I didn't really feel lonely as I was a very imaginative kid.\n\nImagine how scary it was for my parents when my... \"episodes\" started. This is how it'd go about: I'd be sound asleep around midnight. Suddenly, with my eyes open and a blank stare, I would scream and scream non-stop. No one could wake me up. They would shake me, slap me (I'm latina lol), throw some water, but nothing worked. Eventually, my dad settled for holding me tightly until the screaming ceased. This would last about 15 minutes. And it was every single night.\n\nThey tried a lot of things. Called a catholic priest to bless the house. My midnight mayhems stopped for about 2 weeks, but then started again. Eventually, my mom complained about it at school to one of her coworkers. This lady is what you might call a spiritual person, and she was concerned. Eventually, those episodes stopped. My mom at some point casually mentioned to that coworker how it hadn't happened in a while, and that's when the lady told my mom \"I know, I did something about it\". Apparently she wrote a letter to some knowledgeable-spiritual-person or something (it's hard to explain even in my native language, honestly) and they had responded to her that my guardian angel was \"turning his back on me\" (exact words) and they did something (don't know what) that fixed it.\n\nI have never had any episodes since then. I honestly don't remember what I was seeing or dreaming about. It's really weird because dad said I had my eyes open the whole time and wouldn't even blink, so I don't really know if I was dreaming, hallucinating or anything like that. I remember gaining consciousness and feeling really tired, dad pressing me about what the nightmare was about (I couldn't remember a thing). I also remember after the episodes stopped, I once had a nightmare and mom and dad were really concerned the thing had come back, but I felt it was different because I remember the nightmare and was easily woken up. I think my parents were just so tired and didn't want to go through it again. \n\nThat being said, I have a few questions. Was that lady bsing? Has anyone ever heard of such a thing? And if guardian angels really are a thing, was he \"turning his back on me\" literally or leaving me? Like, was the guy distracted? Or was he done? Why would a guardian angel leave a child? And what kind of spell/ritual could they do to prevent that? Because really, it worked. Whatever that lady did, it really worked. I know this might sound outlandish and silly, but if you guys know anything about that kind of stuff, I'd like to know more. Also, if there's a reasonable non-paranormal explanation for this, I'd like to know. Thanks in advance!",

        "text": "We are looking for advice on how to handle a definite energy in a house. So this could get to be a long story, but here you go…\n\nMy fiancé and I live with and take care of her elderly grandmother in her grandmothers house. \n\nThe family has many stories of things that have occurred in the house, various phenomena such as sightings, being unable to move from bed, and being locked in a room from the inside. \n\nThere is also a lot of family trauma, the grandmother herself is very vindictive and callous. Overall a very evil dynamic within the family so much so it is often draining to my fiancé and I. \n\nMy fiancé and I have used the Ouija board in the house 2 times, both of which were successful. There is a general feeling of spirits in the house so we were not surprised. \n\nThere is something particularly off about downstairs, specifically the laundry room and a bedroom adjacent to the laundry room. Fittingly referred to as “The doll room” due to it being filled with large dolls. The energy in both rooms is simply heavy. It always feels as though someone is behind you, watching. \n\nSomething particularly odd occurred today. While my fiancé was in the kitchen she began to have that feeling of someone else being there, then the lights that she was standing beneath went out. Just after this, her grandma entered the room and stated that my fiancé’s aunt said she cannot come to the house anymore because she brings back bad spirits. The grandmother then said “Do you think I should throw away the doll in the window?” This took my fiancé aback as nothing was insinuated about the dolls in the conversation at all. When my fiancée probed her grandmother about the dolls, she just stayed there was no reason she brought them up, just simply “that’s all I could think it would be”. A normal conversation ensued after this, and after several minutes of conversation about food and other topics, her grandmother looked up from the table and said something along the lines of “do you think we should give that doll away, to get rid of it?”. Then, some time later stated how she could never go into the laundry room (adjacent to the doll room) by herself. \n\nI once had a strange occurrence in the laundry room myself. Once, my fiancee and I were in there doing laundry and she said that it creeps her out. I, unknowingly and immediately after she said that, stated “I’ve been in this house 54 years and nothing has happened to me”. I had no idea where that came from and I got a surge of emotion that made my eyes begin tearing up.\n\nWe are creeped out and we need some serious advice.",

        "text": "TW: RELIGION &amp; TALK OF UNAL*VING\n            \n\nBackstory:\n So I (f20) dated B (m20) from March 2021 through July 2022. His father was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer in May 2021 and sadly passed away a month later. His Dad had a history of alcoholism and two nights before he passed, he recalled having a “spiritual awakening” where he experienced a darkness leave his body and saw a light coming towards him while the “dark smoke” left his body. Fast forward to about a month after his passing B tells me how he’s been feeling like something dark is following him around, I brush it off as him just being paranoid and mentally unstable from his father’s passing.\n\n  In December of the same year I invited B to my employee christmas party at the bar I worked at. The drinks were on house so we had more than plenty that night (I would like to also add that my parents also attended the party and my Dad was sober). Well the night was going great until we got home.\nBefore I get into the events that took place I would like to say that they are a bit fuzzy for me to recall due to my having to block this time out for the case of my sanity lol.\n\nParanormal sh*t:\n\nAnywho, B and I were in my room talking and ended up getting into an argument that resulted in my bed frame being broke, meanwhile we’re both very drunk. B then gets quiet and starts to get emotional about his dad, so i try to console him but he isn’t taking it. My dad then takes him into the living room to try and talk to him when he looks over at the wall and is talking to his dad like he’s right there saying “Dad what are you doing, stop it dad your scaring me” he then gets onto the ground and crawls to the corner of my living room and is hysterically crying but suddenly gets quiet. We were all confused and pretty frightened as well because this was not like him. As my dad gets up to check on him the scariest most vile voice came out of B that we’ve ever heard, it was like a gurgling growl and he was speaking in the strange language that we couldn’t understand. Now my family is religious (christian) but not like crazy follow the bible to a T religious. My dad yells for me to go grab his bible and wooden cross along with some sage to cleanse the house, as I’m walking back into the living room things started getting pretty scary.\n\nI’m sure most of you have seen the one Conjuring scene i think where the girl is running down the steps in a backbend yeah? Well B did that across my living room while making this weird growling noise mind you this guy can’t even touch his toes, so my dad (who is also a Marine vet) throws him onto the couch and is holding him down. I pass my mom the sage and and she sits onto B’s legs to stop him from trying to kick my dad, i then hand my dad the cross and sit on B’s abdomen. I find this next part really strange because when i opened the bible and started reading, the verses were about expelling negative energies out of people. B became extremely violent both physically and verbally saying how he’s going to unal*ve us, and other things that i prefer not to say.\n\nThings take a turn for the worst when my dad placed the cross on B’s forehead and began reciting the Lord’s prayer. As soon as my dad began speaking, B starts laughing but it’s not his laugh, this sounded like pure evilness. He begins to call himself the watcher and how he is stronger than all of the prayers and sage that we were burning, my dad argues back saying how nothing is stronger than the love of God and that’s when B’s eyes went black. When this happened it wasn’t like he closed his eyes and they were black when he opened them, it was like a smoke cloud completely covered his eyes and grabs my Dad’s hand breaking his thumb that’s when I lost it, I knew who I was looking at wasn’t human. I ran into my parents bedroom freaking out and called his mom to tell her what was happening, she calls 911 to send an ambulance. When the police arrived I was relieved, I thought this nightmare was finally over, but boy was I wrong. At first the cops thought that he may have taken meth or K2, but quickly realized it was much worse when he began talking in that strange language. \n\nThe police tried to ask B questions and he would reply hysterically laughing while explaining in great detail how he was going to unal*ve them and their families. I felt so helpless as I looked at the cops with pure fear in their eyes backing away and calling for backup. Once more policemen arrived my Dad was able to let go of B but when he did so, B lunged at the cops and they taxed him but that didn’t stop him so 5 police officers tackle him to the ground to restrain him and are still struggling so one of the ems comes over and injects him with some sort of sedative which thankfully knocks him out. They load him onto a stretcher and take him to the local hospital overnight, and his mom and sister picked took him home the next day.\n\nI still can’t really wrap my head around what happened that night, I have so many questions like who is the watcher, how could my 50 yr old dad have the strength to hold him down for 4 hours when five policemen couldn’t, and how wasn’t he arrested for assaulting that cop? I still have nightmares about that night, i’m petrified of the dark, and I can’t even watch paranormal films (used to be my favorite) without getting flashbacks from that night. I know i need therapy for what happened but don’t want to be deemed as insane.\n\nI’m not expecting anyone to read any of this as I’m mainly writing this as a way to cope with what happened.",

My mum doesn’t like to imagine it being a ghost or a spirit, she likes to just ignore it. The knocking doesn’t have a pattern, but I can usually hear it when I’m in the kitchen. Ive tried to talk with whatever it is, and get it to knock on my command but when i start to talk it stops. Any ideas?

One looks a little similar to my previous cat—same shape and grey coloring. They love exploring and hiding, so I put out lots of boxes and blankets for them to hang out in.\n\nOn the second day I had them at home, they were exploring my bedroom and I came in to check on them. I saw a little pair of grey paws sticking out of a box and figured that the one who looks like my previous cat was in there and the other could be under the bed. I looked under the bed and lo and behold, both of my new cats were looking at me from under the bed.\n\nI looked back in the box where I had seen the paws (very clearly—I seriously thought there was a physical cat in there), but they were gone! I like to think it was my previous cat visiting to meet my new cats and tell me he approves :)",

        "text": "So, I’ve been having some strange experiences the last year or so but the main “thing” (idk what to call it really) is this kind of free floating ethereal “air.” \n\nThe way I try to describe it is that this air looks like the way unlit propane does. But it’s traveling, moving. My first thought was “that looks like a person who’s invisible and walking around my room.”\n\nBut it’s definitely not.  It’s more like a mirror. Because whenever I stop and stare at it closely and just relax I can see myself being projected back to me. Not like a mirror would, but from different angles. Like overhead, or behind me..etc. it’s a projection of me on a slight delay. \n\nThe slight delay is why it took me a really long time to understand what I was watching. It was just an image of me mirroring whatever I did but on a delay. The delay is like 4-5 seconds I’d say. So it’s more than “slight.” But that’s why it took me so long. This strange looking shimmering air has moved. It’s gone inside me. It really feels like it’s intent is malicious, as when it goes inside me (yea I know that sounds funny) my heart rate skyrockets. My skin burns. My arms and legs have shook, my teeth nearly chattering. It’s really a disturbing experience in every way and I’ve posted on some other subs, as I like science, so when confronted with this my first thought was some kind of tech. \n\nAnyways I’m more open-minded after this and I was just wondering if anyone has experience anything similar.

        "text": "I was driving up a hill with two-lane merging at the top, with a single oncoming lane coming downhill.  The weather was snowy with some accumulation on the roadside, but some slush and road salty water on the road. I had two slow moving vehicles up ahead which I was not following closely, and another vehicle behind me. The second furthest vehicle ahead of me was at least 100 yards uphill.\n\nSuddenly in my rear view, a fast moving black sedan appeared, in the uphill passing lane. I did not take a close look and the view wasn’t good anyway due to weather. My reaction was to slow a bit and go a little to the right, because I didn’t think this car could safely overtake the next vehicle, let alone both vehicles up ahead before the merge. If something was coming downhill, and he tried to pass both cars, he’d be doing it on a dangerous surface, and would have to thread the needle to get through.  As luck would have it, an 18 wheeler appeared at the top of the hill coming down. \n\nI was surprised to see this black car pass me going what looked like 90 mph, and go past the next vehicle, because this meant he would meet the semi on a less than ideal road surface. \n\nHere’s where it got a little weird. The truck meets me and goes down the hill. As I near the top of the hill, I look for this black vehicle, expecting it to be between the vehicle ahead of me, and behind the second vehicle up the road. It is gone.\n\nWhen I crested the hill, it goes straight for about 1.5 miles. I went left a little to look ahead, and this black car doesn’t appear to be there. I don’t see it’s taillights. I only see some oncoming headlights.\n\nIf he lost control and went into the ditch before meeting the truck, I missed it. All I know is I never saw it again after it passed the car in front of me.",

That cat I chose was from a shelter and had been there most of her life, her name was Jetta, and she had the coolest fur because she appeared to be all black but when you pushed her fur forward it was white... however, since day 1, I believe that since she was in a kennel, most of her life she liked small spaces, which I wish I understood that at that age because I didn't understand or barely seen her... it got to the point where I regretted the cat I chose because it was like not even having a cat at all... but I regrettably ended up bullying her a little, not to a point of tragedy but enough to make me feel a little bad... as I said, she would hide in my closet 99% of the time, and I would peek in on her often, but when I did, she seemed scared... 1 day, I decided to give her a bath because she needed it medically... that's when I found out about her worst fear, hair dryers... I have never seen a cat ready to fight an object in my life, and at the time, I found it amusing... so sometimes I would like to get the hair dryer and pay her a visit in her closet, we'll she finally come out of the closet  to stand up in the living room ready  for the hair dryer to attack her, I quickly stopped teasing her with it but soon she seemed scared of me... so at that point, I just let her outside because we were kind of in the country, and I wanted her to be normal, 1 day, she never came back, and soon after, I had night terrors of a human like cat that kept peeking on me while on my bed from the closet.",

        "text": "I decided to go fishing in an inland bay last Sunday. It was probably about 50 degrees out, so I really didn’t expect to catch anything. I just like fishing. \n\nI made it to the bay around noon and got comfortable on the small public pier. I must have spent about an hour watching wildlife and keeping an eye on my fishing pole before I noticed anything strange. \n\nAs I stared blankly at the murky bay I noticed something strange in my peripheral. I swore, only a couple meters away, a silhouette standing there. It surprised me, so I snapped my head in that direction. Then it was gone. I’m fascinated by unusual things, so I’m familiar with the shadow person phenomenon. I’m also a fan of the movie, John Dies at the End. And it gave me an idea. I thought that, if it was something real, I might be able to catch it in the corner of my eye before turning slowly to get a better view. \n\nI probably spent the next 45 minutes pacing back and forth at the end of the pier, checking my rod for bites and being careful not to look in the direction of where I thought I saw the shadow person. I saw nothing. I eventually got bored and gave up on my ghost hunt. \n\nNot much to talk about for a while after that. But, around 3:40, I saw it again. That time I was a bit more prepared. I tried to keep it in my peripheral and slowly turn my attention toward it. It didn’t work very well. It seemed to disappear again. I started to look around for things that could explain strange shapes in the corner of my eye. There was a trash can, but it was about 4 feet away from where I perceived the anomaly. And I was fully aware of the trash can the entire time. Other than that, there was a fishing line recycling receptacle a little closer to where I saw it. But it was paper white, and the thing I saw was a lot darker in color. And, whatever it was, appeared to be quite a bit taller than the trash can or the line recycling receptacle.\n\nSo, I tried again. I spent about 20 minutes pacing around on the pier and looking for whatever it could have been in the corner of my eye. I didn’t see it again before I decided to pack up. It was getting late and the weather was taking a turn. It looked like rain. So, I packed my things and split. \n\nNot far past the pier is a sidewalk. Then, after the sidewalk is a boardwalk that goes over the marsh. The boardwalk is surrounded by tall grass. As I walked o down the boardwalk I noticed something else unusual. The marsh grass near me, and only near me, was bending and moving. None of the tall grass in front of or behind me was moving at all. It wasn’t windy at all. I’m fact, the lack of breeze had been bugging me all day. Shy fish seem to bite more often when it’s breezy. It makes them feel safer from aerial predators in shallow water. I stopped to investigate. I wanted to see if my mind was playing tricks on me. I can buy my footsteps, on the boardwalk, moving a little as I passed through. But the movement in the grass was way too exaggerated. A lot of it moved, not just a little. \n\nAnyway, once I stopped walking, the grass took a couple seconds to stop moving. I was definitely intrigued, but I had places to be. I just continued back to my truck. There is a giant mound of dirt in the middle of the public park. Probably turf on top of trash. It was probably a land fill before. But there is a beautiful view of the bay from up there. And walking over the hill is pretty much a short cut back to the parking lot as long as you have the leg strength. So that’s the way I decided to go.\n\nOnce I was on the top of the hill I turned around to take another look at the bay before I left. And, guess what was on the pier. That’s right, a shadow person. It was about 200 yards away then. And, being a modern person, I went for the phone in my pocket. But, by the time I got to it, the specter was gone. \n\nI’m not saying that any of this is undeniable proof of anything. I’m just saying it was strange. Could have been my mind playing tricks on me, I guess. Hell, half of my platoon witnessed shadow people in Afghanistan. But not me. So I believe things like that are real, but probably relatively rare. I really can’t say. I just know what I think I saw the other day. At least it adds a little mystery to my otherwise boring life.",

They have a German shepherd dog and two cats, who get along well and never attack each other.\n\nlast night I went to feed the dog, which they have in the backyard. They have those kinds of lights that turn on when I move, so whenever I feed the dog they turn off because I'm not constantly moving.\n\nI was feeding the dog and all of a sudden he starts barking towards the back door. I was confused because the cats were sitting on the grass and the dog never barks at them, then the light turned on at the entrance of the house, and I managed to see a kind of white/grey cat (it was a little bigger than a cat average) running very fast towards the entrance of the house. I look at him with suspicion because it seemed that it was going to enter the house, since I left the door open, and it turned to see me and it had this kind of eyes that really scared me, I don't know how to describe them, they seemed human and they were staring at me.\n\nthe dog kept barking, so \"the cat\" ran inside the house. I was scared, but I followed it into the house and couldn't find it. I don't know what it was but it really managed to scare me and I want to know if any of you know what it could be, because it wasn't a normal cat.",

There was literally no way someone could even guess it. \n\nBut the board knew.\n\nIt spelled my middle name perfectly and I could feel my heart fall into my gut. Keep in mind, my hands were not on the planchette so I couldn't have moved it myself. Everyone laughed because what a silly middle name that would be but I had to confess that it *was* mine and the color drained from everyone's face. \n\nAll of a sudden, a glass ash tray that was sitting a few feet away on the coffee table split clean in two, and we were *done*. \n\nWe left the house to go stay somewhere else and fortunately, I have never experienced anything that terrifying again.",

However within the past year I have rekindled my passion for physics, as well as conspiracy theories and spirituality. \n\nI am also Bipolar. I have been living without medication for almost a year up until this point. \n\nSo December 25th, I began experiencing what would be a severe manic episode. Third one this year. However things were different. I felt divinely inspired to radically change my life. I started cleaning up my apartment, meditating, sleeping on the floor, and using my phone less. \n\nI also began seeing things I hadn't noticed before. When I take off my glasses I can see particles of light dancing around. These refractions of light overlap and form shapes. The simplest shape is a single eye at the center of my vision. However sometimes an array of eyes form triangles (star of david) and sometimes circles (vesica piscis). At its most complex form, they quite literally look like biblical angels, like wings made of eyes. I can see these angels sober but it does require meditation. It also helps to smoke a little weed to be able to fully experience it. \n\nIt is now the morning of the 27th and the second day of my shitty job when my car wouldn't start. I saw it as a sign from god. I would use the day to plan how I wanted to end my life. I confided in my roommate. I told her that I would die on the first of January. She was surprisingly understanding. I was confident that I was making the right decision. \n\nHowever, when she went to hang out with friends that evening, I made my move and left, throwing my phone out the window. My real plan was to quantum suicide (will explain) and return on January 1st. I left no trace of the outside world and no no one but my roommate knew. So I started walking in one direction. I didn't know what would happen. I was left with only divine inspiration and survival instinct\n\nQuantum suicide is basically the idea that in every moment you can quantify, you are making a decision to live or die. Every moment creates a parallel universe in which you kill yourself, and in some you will live forever. And in that case you are both dead and alive until observed by someone else. \n\nDuring my manic adventure on the night of the 27th, I headed into the woods at first to feel closer to god. I also walked into oncoming traffic to test whether they would hit or not (they never did). At some point I even stripped naked inside a gas station. At that point the cops were called and they escorted me to a hospital, all without telling them any information such as my name, number, address, etc. Basically told them I knew nothing. \n\nDuring my time in the ER they held me all morning. They even took an MRI of my brain to see if I had any head trauma. Upon going into the MRI I closed my eyes and they immediately pulled me out. A nurse muttered “is it usual for patients to die like this?” At some point they even shot a splinter into my right heel (???). And asked me if I wanted to leave it. I said yes. Eventually with no information, they released me from the ER and I was on my way home.\n\nThis is when the story gets weird. \n\nI took a right out of the ER onto the main road and started walking with no place to be. That's when I came across someone who ive never met before. But he knew me. He knew everyone on the street. In reality we were as far different as we could be. I was a young transgender woman talking to a middle aged drunk white guy and we talked as if we've been friends our lives. And I followed him blindly. We took the metro and watched people come in and out. I taught him everything I thought to be true about the universe and he seemed to know it intuitively. And when I lost him he would blow raspberries or speak in another language. I'm not sure what this experience means but in my understanding at the time I felt like I was Jesus talking to God. And when it was his time to get off, I got off too. Never seen him again. \n\nWhen I got off the metro, that's when I ran into who I believed to be Mother Gaia. Her first words to me were “oh, a fellow light bearer!” She was a beautiful dark skinned woman who looked to be in her 30s/40s. She had a birthmark on the left side of her face and was blind. She explained to me that anything and everything that you could possibly imagine was true in the afterlife. Mountains are just fallen petrified giants, dinosaurs were actually very tiny, like chickens, and no matter what you believe, your version of the universe comes true. In her eternal afterlife, she went deep into the woods without contact from other humans. \n\nShe later told me how to properly pronounce Gaia. It is very rhythmic, and I was able to understand it intuitively given my background in music. Of course, I forgot how she pronounced it. I dont think it is meant for me to know. But the closest would be a 3 syllable word that is one 1/16th note, one 1/8th note, and one 1/16th. (1e, a)\n\nAfter giving me all the tools needed to survive in this higher dimensional plane, she left me to do more important things I assume. However I realized there was something off about this realm. The majority of people had their eyes sewn shut. The only “light bearers” I could find were dark skinned people (I am white).  Also, you could only turn left. Every street corner had a ‘one way’ sign pointing left. As I kept turning right, I realized I was undoing time. I tried to get away from other people but as I kept walking things began making less sense.\n\nI remember walking into a pizza shop but when I talked, they couldn't understand me when I talked. I was hungry, and they served me, but I had to gesture with my hands for them to understand me. When I sat down to eat, I overheard one of the people asking “was that an alien or something?”\n\nI eventually got onto a bus to “submit my will to the universe”. I tried to avoid eye contact with everyone, particularly white people. I also had telepathic powers. When I observed a fellow light bearer and said “Mother Gaia” in my head, she looked up at me and waved, as if in awe.\n\nWhen I got off the bus it was night time. I was far from home. I was stuck in a time loop in which I kept walking between a Holiday Inn and a Denny’s. Nothing was making sense anymore and the more I asked for help the less things made sense. The people served me without money, but I understood them to be demons and were tricking me. By this time I had been awake for 4 earth days. I had no energy and I felt like I was dying. But I couldn't sleep. \n\nEventually I remembered what Mother Gaia had told me, which was to use the main line (phone). I borrowed a phone from dennys to call the only number I could remember, which was my mother’s. However, she lived about 2400 miles away and couldn't get me any time soon. So I waited at Denny's for what felt like eternal hell, with only my faith guiding me. \n\nAt some point I noticed two black gentlemen sitting at a table and I tried to communicate to them telepathically. I said Mother Gaia in my head and they said out loud “Shes in there” and pointed to a lottery arcade room that wasn't there before. I walked in and found an older black woman who later said her name was Heavenly. We both reached out to each other and kissed. I wrapped my entire body around her as the demons tried to pull me away. I then asked if she consented, which she said she did. I also remember screaming “I am born pure in a world of sin”.\n\nShe was crazy like me too. Her reality didn't make sense to mine but the overlap in the things we both understood helped me keep my faith in this eternal hell. She too had been trapped in eternal torment in the afterlife, but had been there much longer than me. She had been alive since times of slavery, describing the cruel practices she endured and continued to endure as she ascended dimensions. She had gone mad with esoteric knowledge.\n\nShe explained to me that the reality is that there has to be order (hierarchy) for there to be balance in the universe. Slavery was a necessary evil and a test for the true chosen people of God. “It's better that way. It has to be that way” Her words not mine.\n\nI eventually realized that she was older and wiser than me, so when the police came I let her talk for me and explain my situation. I opted to instead kneel before her and look only into her eyes. She thanked me. She told me her name was Heavenly. She told me she couldn't come with me, and that if I submit my will to theirs i will not be hurt because I am white. The police soon handcuffed me and lifted me away into the cop car. \n\nThey eventually took me into a hospital center called Legacy. I was in a padded dark room with a single bed and single window of light where nurses kept eye on me at all times. The door almost looked alien, and could not be opened from the outside. Many times I would try to escape but couldn't. This truly was the darkest moment of my life. I had been awake for 5 days at this point and was going insane. Realizing that i had no power to leverage, i submitted to their will. I closed my eyes, played dead, and waited for the nurses to swarm in and hold me down as they gave me an IV in my left arm. I kept my eyes closed until I woke up at the Unity center of Legacy, basically an emergency psych room. I woke up on January 1st and was released 5 days later.\n\nEarlier that year I wrote a song. I was able to recite the entire verse by memory during this entire time. I goes like this… \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;From the heights of heaven  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The sky parts in two   \n&gt;  \n&gt;A visage of light descends before me  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In its luminance presence  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I humbly view  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And bask in all its loving glory  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It says to me, “Fear not,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I am with you  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I have known you for all eternity”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“Rest at ease, wounded soul  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For you have arrived  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At the end of your journey”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“I will not betray you  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In your final moments  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I will guide you to serenity”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“Now step into the light  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Traverse this life  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And fulfill your greater destiny”",

        "text": "So this will be a little lengthy but it’s something that we don’t know how to fully handle. \nMy newly wedded wife and myself (literally married almost 2 weeks ago) have had something following us for some time now and we’re almost positive we know who it is. When she was 19, she found her boyfriend of over 2yrs overdosed on the couch past the point of bringing back. It heavily affected her life for 5yrs and still held a great power over her into the beginning of our relationship. With some patience and tough love, I am so proud of how far she has came away from being held down by it. She’s done many rituals and cleanses along the way.\nI will never speak ill of the dead. After many conversations though, it’s been brought to light of what kind of person he was. He wasn’t all bad but had some demons and evil energies in his life. Besides the heavy drug abuse there were times of mental and physical abuse, pointing loaded guns at her and firing them in the house while on his benders, and adulatory in their relationship. He and his friends like to draw pentagrams on his walls and call out to things they didn’t truly understand. A very unsettled person while alive, so with the way he passed I’m sure there’s been struggle for him to move on. She’s had a lot of unsettling experiences with “not feeling alone” and lots of electronics messing up around her through the years and unexplainable things happening. She said she knows it’s him just by the way things feel when it happens. She’s has cleansed our house multiple times, went to his grave and spoke the want for closure out loud to let him know it’s time for her to move on. She even left some prized possessions of his that she had been holding on to at the grave site to help herself move on. She has put in so much work to move along is what I’m trying to say. \nEverything has been good up to a couple months ago. She had the words “I Love You” tattooed on her arm after he passed in his hand writing from a love note he’d wrote to her. Tattoos are a powerful ceremony in my eyes and she has admitted she didn’t realize what she was doing when she got it. So a few months ago she decided to get it covered up with a beautiful tattoo, almost as a final cleanse. Well that’s when we started really feeling uneasy in our own home. We both started bickering without any real problems. Not feeling the healthiest. Some appliances started acting up. We just marked it off as an inconvenience and moved on. Well we decided to go to New Orleans to get married and planned the whole trip out. We both like to indulge in some adult activities and substances a couple times a year, so we hit it hard for a full week and a half for the holiday season and our wedding/honeymoon. The reason I’m bringing this up is because you can’t use and abuse your body, mind and substances without backlash (weakening your soul and body). We had one bad day during the honeymoon where we fought pretty hard (our dopamine and serotonin were depleted). The night before she dreamed of shooting her ex in the head and I dreamed of them pulling a trick on me to get me put in jail and taking all my belongings. So the next morning wasn’t the best either. When we started arguing pretty badly, we both noticed everywhere she went in the Airbnb, the lights would start flickering and ceiling fans would try to turn off. We both had an idea of what was happening. It’s scared her and pissed me off. (She is an extremely sweet, loving and timid girl. I am a very head strong, loving but no bullshit kind of guy. Especially when it comes to the comfort of my loved ones.) So seeing her scared and uncomfortable mad me pretty mad at what was causing this, or who. I went and sat on the couch and looked forward towards a huge mirror on the wall. I’ve had my unexplainable encounters in life but I had not seen an undeniable figure of something unexplainable until then. She was in the process of walking up behind me while I was on the couch and as I looked up and seen her in the mirror, there was the silhouette of a man behind her shoulder. Not a “maybe that dark spot looked like a man”, but a black figure that was undeniably the black shape of a man. I didn’t get scared, just aggravated that someone was trying to interfere with my relationship, now marriage. I got up and sat at a little table against the wall and started messing with some things. This place had light fixtures along the top of the halls and rooms around the entire place. As I sat there and her in the other room, I noticed the lights start to flicker one at a time comping down the wall towards me. It stopped at the light above the seat that was across from me and started to flicker HARD. After a second of ignoring the light and feeling like someone who hated me was setting across from me, I slammed my hand down on the table and shouted “F*CK OFF! You don’t have power here and you need to leave her alone! She’s moved on and you need to too!!”. When I said this the flickering in the lights shot down the hall, one light at a time and then stopped and the the lights all weee fine. Some real deal Stranger Things shit… I didn’t tell her about my experience until we left Louisiana because I didn’t want to scare her more than she already was. Now that we’re back home, she has went through all of her things and gathered he belongings that were even inside their old house and plans on burning them. She says she still feels uneasy and doesn’t like being alone in our own house. What do we do?",

        "text": "I have always been very fascinated by paranormal events and very interested in them. I have tried in my life already most different rituals for spirit conjurations and the same. But nothing really worked until a few months ago. I drift around a lot on the Internet and look for the most diverse things. Then about 4 months ago I came across the so-called \"tape voices\". This is a way to contact spirits via audio tapes. I read up a lot on the subject because I really wanted to try it myself and contact my deceased great-grandmother, whom I never met. \n\nI decided to conduct the tape voice experiment. I got the necessary equipment and a few tapes and began the preparations. I chose a quiet evening, turned off all the lights, and sat down in my room with the tape recorder. I began by asking questions of my late great-grandmother and asked her to record her voice on the tape if she was able. I left the tape running and waited anxiously to see what would happen.\n\nWhen I played the tape later, I was disappointed at first because nothing seemed to be recorded on it. But then I suddenly heard a soft whisper, which I at first thought was imagination. I played the tape again and this time the whisper was more audible. It sounded like a woman's voice and I was sure it was my great-grandmother's voice.\nNeedless to say, I was very excited and decided to make further attempts. \n\nThe next few nights I repeated the experiment and each time it seemed that I had made contact with my great-grandmother. However, I began to feel very tired and had less and less energy. I also found myself sleeping less and less and my appetite decreased. I thought that maybe it was because of the emotional stress that had been taken up by the contact with my deceased great-grandmother.\n\nBut then, suddenly, eerie things began to happen. I started seeing shadows in my room and there was knocking on my door, although no one was there. I also heard voices that I couldn't explain and it seemed like someone was invading my room when I was asleep. I began to feel uncomfortable in my own room and just slept fitfully. I tried to give up my experiments with tape voices, but the eerie events did not stop. I felt that I had awakened something that I could not send back to its world. \n\nI began to investigate and find out what I had done and how I could undo it. I came across many theories about spirit summoning and the effects it can have. Some people said that I had summoned an evil spirit and that I needed to have an exorcism performed to get rid of it. Others said that I simply needed to stop the ritual and separate myself from the tape.\n\nI decided to try the latter method and stopped my experiments with the tape. I took the tape out of my room and stashed it in a box that I hid in my basement. I thought that would be the end of it all. But the eerie events continued. I was still seeing shadows and still hearing voices. It seemed as if what I had conjured up was still there, haunting me.\n\nI was desperate and didn't know what to do anymore. I was afraid to be in my own house and spent most of my time outside. I was also unfocused, had trouble sleeping, and felt like I was being watched. \n\nI decided to seek professional help and spoke with a parapsychologist. He helped me understand what I had done and how to undo it. He explained to me that I had made an unsafe and inexperienced attempt and that I had created an opening for unwanted energy. With his help and support, I finally managed to bring the uncanny events to a stop. I realized that it is important to proceed carefully and with great caution when experimenting with paranomal phenomena. \n\nI learned that sometimes it is better to let some things rest and not try to understand or control them. But I would still like to know what that being was.",

        "text": "Ok, so this is my very first post on Reddit ever. My name is Julia. I've scoured the internet to get some answers but cant seem to find anything and I'm really hoping that someone here might have some more information about this.\n\nIt happened for the first time around the age of 15 or 16 and then once again when I was 21. The first time it occurred I was outdoors, the second time indoors, this will be important to the story. \n\nThe first time i was with a friend, hanging out in a wooded area. I'm not sure but i'd say it was around 3-4PM either in spring or early autumn, im not sure. The sun wasnt setting yet however it wasnt bright outside either, i can remember the sky being gray-ish. So i remember just hanging out with a friend, and all of the sudden in this spot where the tress were less dense i saw this static-like snow-ish effect right there. It was very subtle, the best way i can describe it is; imagine a mix of snow and white glitter, falling in slow motion with the transparency turned down to 50%. It didnt fall from the sky, it didnt fall to the ground, it didnt come in sweeping from the sides or whatever. It just seemed like this large circular spot in the air where this static/snow appeared and began to slowly fall and fade towards the edges of the spot where it appeared... I asked my friend if she was seeing it too and she did. We kinda stood there wondering, not really in shock or anything since it was so subtle and non-threatening, we just really didnt know what to make of it. Since the sky was gray and we were in a wooded area i thought its probably either moisture evaporating from the ground or falling from the sky or treetops.\n\nSo to test my theory i went to stand in the spot to check if i could feel or see any moisture on my skin. Absolutely nothing. The air didnt feel more moist the the rest of the area and i didnt notice anything different. At a certain point my and my friend just left cause it was getting late. We never got an explanation, so for years i've just assumed that most likely it was just some strange but natural phenomenon.\n\nFast forward a few years later, I'm attending one of my college classes. I need to describe the lay-out of the classroom quickly for this part to make sense. There were 3 vertical rows of tables where 2 students could be seated per table. Facing the left row (from my POV) was the teachers table. My friend and I were seated at the first table of the right row. I had the seat at the right side of the table, my friend at the left side, meaning that whenever i looked at the teacher i could inevitably see my friend in the left corner of my sight. Lmao excuse me if this sound way more complicated than it is, idk how to attach photos to posts, i will attach a sketch later to visually show the lay-out. \n\nANYWAYS, we are sitting in class, i think we had an assignment or something that included reading and writing. Me and my friend had already finished whatever we were doing and were kinda waiting in silence for the rest of the class to finish. There was not much to de except just sit and look around. And in this boring and dull moment of waiting, all of the fucking sudden, there it was again. This time i freaking froze. It appeared it the upper right corner corner of the room, above the teacher, kind of right below the ceiling.  Since we were inside i could approximate its size better by comparing it to the walls/windows etc. and i'd say it was around the size of a sphere with the diameter of 40-50cm (16-20 inches). The reason i froze was because: 1. My whole theory from years ago about this being evaporation or whatever natural phenomenon went straight out of the window. 2. Speaking of windows, none of them were open in the classroom, so nothing like dust or whatever could've flown into the room. 3. By looking at this static snow thing, because of my placement in the room I could also see my friend at the same time. I saw his eyes widen and him staring at the same corner of the room, without him knowing i saw it too since he was slightly turned away from me, and so instantly i KNEW that he saw the same fucking thing. A few moments later he turned to me and i just nodded to him to let him know that he's not the only one seeing this. He just went back to staring at it. Mind you, this is a different person than the friend from the first story. Since most people were still writing or reading with their heads down I'm not sure if anyone else in that classroom had seen it too. The teacher didnt notice anything either, fair enough though since it was right above her. At a certain point the phenomenon just kinda faded away. \n\nAnd for i second i need to interject, because as im writing all of this i realise that it sounds like a bad science fiction story written by a 5yr old lol. It's one of those stories that i probably wouldnt believe if i heard it from a stranger, but because i witnessed it myself and with other people i know its real. \n\nBack to the story, the class was over at some point and me and my friend went through every possibility we could think of that might have caused it. Everything was a dead end. There were no vents near the spot where the thing appeared, all of the windows were closed, we didnt see the static snow seeping or falling from a certain spot, it wasnt smoke, it didnt rise from a certain point and smoke is much denser and turns things behind it opaque, this phenomenon is really more like very transparent glittery static snow. It's not a projection since it has depth in it, thats why i keep describing it more like a sphere than a circle, it's 3D. \n\nGoogle results yield nothing but articles about TV static, white noise or vision problems lol. Literally nothing that could explain what happened. If youve made it this far; im so very thankful for reading this and your time. It would be so awesome to know if anyone else has ever witnessed this strange phenomenon, im so curious to know. Thank you ❤️",

You know that feeling you have juust before you wake up, like you're not even sure where or who you are?\n\nI couldn't open my eyes.

I tried to move or open my eyes but the more I fought I felt like the whole area I felt the thing went more and more dead and numb. It felt like a million little needles poking me all at once but not in a painful, more like a tickling way.\n\nI felt it turn my head to the left and I think... Somehow I knew it was studying me, looking me up and down. Now when I say \"it\" I'm not sure if I even believe it was a creature or whatever. I'm not to believe in these things so easily, but I'm a lucid dreamer and I know when I'm dreaming and when I'm awake. Also, this is the second time something like this has happened. But let me finish this encounter first.\n\nI didn't hear or see or smell anything while it happened. I just felt the pressure on my face and slightly my neck and a sort of wariness around it, like it was a \"living\" thing. Now it's not one of those stories I've heard when it felt like it took hours and the people couldn't fight back. I kept on trying to move and after about 10 second, maybe 20, I manage to open my eyes and I saw nothing. Nothing out of the ordinary, just my dimly lit room and the streetlight barely peeking through from between the curtains. I turned my light on and I didn't see or feel anything weird. As weird as it sounds I went straight back to sleep. With the light on this time.\n\n I've been thinking about it a lot recently though and I figured I'd put it out here omewhere sopeople may theorise about what it could've been and what I might be able to do to prevent it from appending again because it was not pleasant. As for the first time I mentioned it happened. It was a few years ago and thousands of miles from my current residence.\n\nAbout 3 years ago I was at a friend's house and I decided to stay the night. This was back from here I moved from after about a year after this. My friend told me I could sleep in his big guest bedroom and he'll go sleep in his room so that's what we did. I want to sleep and I kept having this weird feeling, like there was something else in the room with me. Being a \"non believer\" I figured it was a rat or something behind the old furniture my friend had.\n\nAfter about an hour of struggling to fall asleep I started feeling really cold. Even under two layers of blankets I was freezing. I curled up in a ball in hopes of warming myself up and after a few more minutes of trying to fall asleep this weird feeling became unnervingly... For the lack of a better word scary. It felt like a primal kind of fear that I've always had but never experienced before. Then I started to finally snooze off.\n\nThat is when I felt a chill run down my spine and I swear I felt something quickly pass over my body (this time I was facing down). At the same time I swear I hear a loud whisper. Like a really loud whisper. It wasn't a word or a cry or anything like most people say, it was more of a... Sigh. But like a really loud one, directly into my ear. I also felt pressure on my back for just a moment. This all happened in like two seconds and it made me jolt up in shock.\n\nI turned on the light and stayed up as long as I could. Nothing else weird happened that night or since. Well, until now. I'm not even sure why I'm writing this, I'm sure most people who will read this will think it's fake and those who do believe me might just not know how to help. I'm telling you it's not fake, both things happened. I wasn't dreaming, it wasn't sleep paralysis, I'd know. What it was, I don't know. Again, I'm not really a believer in the paranormal, it might just be my head playing tricks on me, but it sure as he'll felt real. So... This is me being open to suggestions I guess. What do you guys think this is and how could i get rid of it?",

        "text": "I just read another post here that reminded me of my own story, so I thought I’d share and get your opinions. This happened quite a few years ago now, and it never happened since then. It was a one time occurrence (hopefully, ha.) \n\n(There is a **tl;dr** at the end, I wrote a lot, I know.)\n\nI was sleeping and I know I was having a nightmare. I can never remember what the nightmare was, not even at that time after I awoke, but it was quite bizarre; the nightmares before I “woke up” felt suddenly like a tape on fast forward through multiple nightmares. I just remember feeling this fast forward sensation through a bunch of imagery, and then I woke up.\n\nHere is the weird thing, before this point I have never astral travelled, so I can’t tell you that I know for certain how it feels to willfully astral travel. But in this moment I’m about to describe, I felt this knowing of being in my astral body. Let me explain. \n\nFirstly, it’s not an uncommon occurrence for me to wake myself up from a nightmare. On this occasion, I awoke from the nightmare and I was in my bedroom, exactly how it looked right as I went to bed, and my head was exactly where my head rested when I fell asleep. I was looking at my ceiling as if I was awake. I felt awake, sort of. But there was something odd. My body felt at a 45 degree angle, with my head being where my head should be, but my feet were somehow floating in the air. I looked toward my feet to see what the problem is, and I see this giant shadow figure with no discernible features standing through my bed and holding my feet. I think some of you may know what I mean when I say this, but it was darker than night. I’m not sure how to explain but it felt darker than the colour black. \n\nI immediately felt this sense of fear and panic that I’m not even sure I’ve ever felt in my waking life. I desperately wanted to get away from this thing and I started kicking ferociously and trying to wriggle free. It scared the shit out of me. Somehow with my fighting, I actually did manage to get it to release my feet. When my feet landed in my body after breaking free, I *immediately* woke up in real life. That’s also an indicator to me that it was the astral body (feel free to disagree.)\n\nI wake up immediately but I still the same fear and awareness of what just happened to me. But this is what’s odd, I felt *so* sleepy… it didn’t feel natural. It felt like I was fighting to stay awake, and I had this really odd knowing that if I fell back asleep, I would go right back to that thing. I knew (or felt) while awake, that that shadow thing was still in my room, still right there through my bed. I felt like I knew it was waiting for me to fall back asleep. I told myself in my head, whilst awake, that I *had* to get up, I *had* to stay awake. I’ll tell you, it oddly felt like it took a lot of might and effort to push myself to sit up, but I did it. I may have even started slapping myself lightly in the face, but I remember sitting straight up in my bed and doing whatever I had to do to remain conscious and not go back to sleep.\n\nI’m sitting up in my bed, but I still felt terrified for some reason. I felt as though some weird natural instinct and awareness unlocked in that moment, because I felt it still there though I couldn’t see it. I think if you were to chalk that up to a nightmare, you would feel at that point it is okay to go back to sleep. But I didn’t feel that way yet. I made myself sit there, sat up and I started praying for this thing to leave my room. I am not a religious person, but I do consider myself spiritual and believe in a source power, guides, etc. I just put out mental messages about it leaving and asking for help to make it do so.\n\nAfter some moments, I felt different. I didn’t feel so insanely drowsy, I felt awake (but still tired as I had only been asleep for a few hours and it was the middle of the night.) Again, with this really odd feeling of awareness, I just knew it was gone and it was okay to go back to bed. I laid back down and went to sleep and had no nightmares afterward and no issues. Like I said, it never happened again. \n\nAfter just reading the other person’s post, they mentioned feeling as if the entity feeding off of her and her partner’s energy and making them feel drained. I had never considered that in the past, but when I read that post, it felt like something clicked. I felt like “was that thing feeding off my energy?” I’m not sure. \n\nI’ll be honest that I’m not super familiar with sleep paralysis but from what I’ve read, it sounds similar. From my understanding however, the person is fully awake, which I was not when I saw the being. I also, once awake, was able to move, but with a lot of effort. \n\nIt’s hard for me to chalk it up to just a dream when:\n\n1. It almost felt like I *couldn’t* wake up from my nightmare because of this thing holding my astral body, and that’s why I *only* awoke in my astral body. It almost felt like my astral body was trying to go back into me as my body tried to wake up from this nightmare, but it couldn’t.\n\n 2. I woke up as soon as my astral feet fell into where my physical feet should be, literally immediately.\n\n3. The difficulties of forcing myself to stay awake didn’t feel like usual drowsiness, it almost felt my body forcing me back to sleep.\n\n4. The intense fear I felt of going back to sleep was not normal. Other than being a usual kid being scared by nightmares, I’ve never felt this fear of going back to sleep other than in this instance. I didn’t feel safe in my own room, like I said, with some weird natural instinct. \n\nWhat are your thoughts about this situation? Is this actually sleep paralysis? Or not even close? You can also feel free to chalk it all up to a dream or my imagination, but to me it wasn’t. As I said, it happened so many years ago but it sticks with me to this day. I was actually getting chills over and over again writing this, but I pushed through despite creeping myself out writing this at night in my bed, haha. \n\n**tl;dr** Was having a bad nightmare that felt like multiple nightmares on fast forward. “Woke up” in my bed but my feet were in the air. Looked at my feet and saw a giant scary shadow being holding my feet. Started kicking and writhing to get free, eventually did and the immediate moment my feet hit my body, I woke up in real life. Immediately felt an unnatural sense of drowsiness almost like being forced asleep by my body. Forced myself to sit up stay awake. Despite being awake still felt immense fear, and a fear of going back to sleep (despite being a grown adult.) Asked/prayed for the thing to leave my room and after some moments felt lighter and much less drowsy and strange. At that time I felt “safe” to go to sleep, did, and was fine for the rest of the night. It never happened again.",

        "text": "So I grew up in the small town of Hot Springs, SD. I lived there until I was 5 years old. We lived in a small, 3 bedroom house that was built in the 1800s. I remember vividly many strange things that happened, and my parents do also.\n\nI remember once, I was sitting on the couch in the living room and was about to go into my room to grab a toy. The room was to the left of the front door walking in, and there was a faint light cast on the bedroom wall from a street lamp outside. The Curtains were closed, so it was a fuzzy, but semi bright glow. As I was walking towards the room, a shadow of a man started to cross through the light. I thought it was a shadow from someone walking on the street. However, as I looked at it, this man waved at me, and it felt like it looked right at me. It was completely harmless, and didn't scare me as it seemed friendly and I was a young kid at the time who didn't even know what ghosts were. I remember that so clearly. \n\nI once got a lava lamp, a real fancy tall yellow one. I loved it so much. Except one night I was sleeping on the top bunk of my bed (I had my own bunkbed) and I heard a loud bang. I look down, and the lava lamp is sitting perfectly upright in the middle of the room on the floor. It was unplugged from the wall. It turns out that the lamp broke, and my parents still blame me (lol). I know what I saw though, and can't explain how it ended up where it did, upright, without any obvious damage. It just never turned back on. It was weird and made me sad too.\n\nThere was one time I saw a chandelier looking orb thing come out of my wall at night, and float into my bed and then my blankets got pulled back a little. That was all that happened, but it scared me enough to get my parents. There was nothing off in my room, but it was a weird occurrence.\n\nThe house had an old mud room near the back, connected to the kitchen. It was open to the outside, and that's where our dogs would sleep. We had three dogs; a young golden (rather dumb but harmless), a young Italian Greyhound, and another young furry dog that I forgot the breed of (will mention this dog later). I walked outside during the day once, and I heard a voice coming from a vent. All three of the dogs lined up and sat down. The voice was speaking to them, it sounded like a really old woman with a rough voice. It was speaking past me and to the dogs, like it had no idea I was there (if that makes sense). I can't remember what it said, but it asked the dogs questions and they all barked at the same time as an answer. It was truly bizarre. It scared the piss out of me, and I ran to get my dad. He brushed it off but it was weird. Maybe it was a dream though.\n\nAnother time, on my 4th birthday I got this awesome SpongeBob balloon. One of the foil ones from the store. I woke up at night to the balloon pressed pretty hard against the ceiling, and it was slowly dragging across it towards the door, but it was moving like a snail. It scared me so much, I ran and got my parents. Obviously they were pissed since it was the middle of the night, but my dad got up to check anyways. He actually saw the same thing, and watched the balloon pull itself under the doorframe and into the living room. That scared the shit out of him, and he immediately popped it and through it away. He and I still remember that to this day and can't explain it. \n\n My parents said that they encountered many weird things as well. I had a little toy that would talk if you pressed buttons, and they said every time they would walk into the room the toy would say \"Hello there!\" which happened if you pressed a button. When they left, it would say \"goodbye friend!\" They hated that toy. My grandma had the same thing happen to her and hated it. It was not motion activated or anything.\n\nThat furry dog would also growl a lot at night, and my parents found it locked in a closet multiple times. No idea how the dog got in there but it did. That dog ended up attacking me one day, nearly ripping my eye out. We obviously put it down, but I find it strange how that was the only dog that ever growled for no reason, and got locked into random closets. \n\nI know that's a lot of stuff, but it is all very clear to me. I know I was young, but they are such clear memories and my parents can back me up with the weird things that happened. The house also had the previous owner die in it before they bought it. That's not unusual for the area as that is an old town that housed the VA so many people died all over in many houses. I personally think that whatever was in there was totally harmless and wanted to protect me, and my very young sister at the time. Nothing was ever done to harm us. But with the friendly wave, and the communication through the toy, and the way it locked up the dog that eventually attacked me and broke a possible dangerous lamp is kinda soothing to think back to. I wanted to share these memories, and ask if this stuff seems believable. I know I was really young, so it might not be real. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR - Weird occurrences happened in an old house when I was young. None of them were mean in any way, and actually lean towards being more protective in nature.",

        "text": "I walked into the bar, trying to shake off the chill that had settled over me as I'd walked through the rain-soaked streets. The place was nearly empty, save for a woman seated at the bar, nursing a drink.\n\nI took a seat a few stools down from her, catching a glimpse of her face in the mirror behind the bar. She was beautiful, with long, dark hair and piercing green eyes that seemed to look right through me.\n\nAs I ordered my drink, I couldn't help but feel drawn to her. I found myself wanting to strike up a conversation, to get to know her. And as if she could sense my thoughts, she turned to me and smiled.\n\nWe talked for what felt like hours, the time slipping away as we laughed and shared stories. And before I knew it, it was closing time.\n\n\"Do you want to come back to my place?\" I asked, the words tumbling out before I could think better of it.\n\nShe hesitated for a moment, and I was sure she was going to say no. But then she nodded, and we left the bar together, the rain having slowed to a drizzle.\n\nWe spent the night together, and it was amazing. I felt a connection to her that I couldn't quite explain. But when I woke up the next morning, she was gone.\n\nI searched the apartment for any sign of her, but there was nothing. It was as if she had never been there.\n\nBut as I was getting ready to leave for work, I caught a glimpse of something in the mirror. And when I looked closer, I saw that I had a mark on my neck - a small bite mark, almost like a love bite.\n\nI passed out later that day, my mind racing with questions. Who was this woman? And why did she have a tail and black wings? The thought of it sent shivers down my spine.\n\nI woke up in a cold sweat, the image of the woman's wings burned into my mind. I couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right, that I had been taken in by some kind of supernatural being.\n\nI spent the next few days in a state of constant anxiety, jumping at every shadow and unable to focus on anything. I knew I had to find out the truth, but I had no idea where to start.\n\nFinally, I couldn't take it any longer. I grabbed my coat and headed out into the night, determined to find some answers.\n\nI walked the streets for what felt like hours, my mind racing as I tried to piece together the events of that night. And just when I was about to give up, I saw her.\n\nShe was standing in an alleyway, her wings folded behind her as she leaned against the wall. She looked up as I approached, her green eyes piercing through the darkness.\n\n\"You shouldn't have followed me,\" she said, her voice laced with warning.\n\nBut I couldn't turn back now. I had to know the truth.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I demanded. \"What are you?\"\n\nShe let out a sigh, as if she had been expecting this.\n\n\"I'm a succubus,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. \"I feed on the life force of humans.\"\n\nMy heart raced as the pieces fell into place. I had been taken in by a creature of the night, and I had no idea how to escape her grasp.\n\nBut as I stood there, frozen with fear, she reached out and took my hand.\n\n\"It's okay,\" she said, her voice soothing. \"I won't hurt you. I promise.\"\n\nAnd in that moment, I believed her. I don't know if it was her power over me, or if it was something else, but I felt a sudden sense of calm wash over me.\n\nI don't know what the future holds for me and the succubus. All I know is that I can't stay away from her, no matter how dangerous it might be.",

Also throwaway cause don't want people to try and contact my chain of command.\n\n1. A couple weeks ago around November I would say, I woke up too my light in the closest being sort of dim, I would like to mention that there isn't a way to control the brightness. Anyhow I got up to see if it was some sort of electric issue/turn it off (Is still possible but it hasn't happened again so idk) and as soon as I got up it turned off by itself. Freaked me out a bit but it was whatever, closed the door stayed up for a bit and went back to bed. \n2. About 2 weeks later in December I was sleeping and I guess I woke up a little bit but I heard my dresser/desk thing move (its on wheels) and I just noped out pretended it didn't just happen and was trying to go back to sleep. All of a sudden I swear to you I heard my clothing basket move. I had it on the floor right next to my head that night due to just doing laundry a couple hours before and I swear I heard it moved. After that I jumped up and turned on the lights but nothing really seemed out of ordinary. I couldn't remember if my desk was where it was or if it was moved and my clothing basket seemed to be around the same place same as the desk. Didn't go back to sleep that night.\n3. Just a few hours ago and what really inspired me to reach out was the fact that I was waking up (mind you it was around 10pm, 2 hours into my sleep) too what sounded like straight up sprinting towards me. Dude Im telling you it scared the shit outta me and I jumped up put on my glasses and just sat on my bed trying to figure out if i was going crazy. I even woke up my roommate (different room but shared common area) and he said he didn't hear anything and I just woke him up. I then called the guy I share a wall with to see if he heard anything but just my luck he wasn't in his room unfortunately. \n\nThe problem is that I have 0 proof that any of this happened other than my own memories. I plan to get a sleep tracker app installed that people use to record sleep talking to see if I can catch anything. I would also like to add I have once experienced what I know was an auditory hallucination when I had covid a year or so back and my family does have a history of mental illness so It may not be ghosts or whatever but either way I wanna get it figured out.

I've already asked it to leave, as it has no permission to be trespassing on innocent people.\n\nI need this thing gone. It's not wanted/at my house. It's wanted in our family. It was never given permission in the first place. \n\nThey seem to have the ability to been invisible or for them to be seen.\n\n\nI've never seen nor heard of nothing like these things before in my life. These things invaded into my innocent average life and started trying to cause chaos. I'm not going to be attacked for doing nothing wrong and not let my loved ones and/or other innocent victims circumference to there bullying upon good-hearted, loving, caring, honest, loyal and Godly people; who do no kind of Evil to anyone.\n\nI didn't have a problem with this thing until it started lying on me and trying to attack my innocent loved ones/innocent me. Until it started to try and control my every move.\n\n\nThese things are not like you would think of ghost or entities; they are malicious, vindictive, evil creatures. The most shameful part is that they keep attacking children, harmless children. \n\nAny and All Feedback greatly appreciated.\nThank you.",

        "text": "Backstory : (ctrl+f down to \"dilemma\" for TL:DR) \n\nBeen around spirits my whole life (house was Haunted growing up. Likely uneasy energy from previous owners + my parents old stuff which has been passed down through generations) , and have a very good bearing on whether something is friend , nuetral, or foe , and also know enough to not give permission to anything. Overall I'd say I'm 8/10 comfortable in paranormal situations (things moving on their own or  unexplained noises don't really phase me). \n\nI also have a deep admiration for history. About 4 or 5 months ago, my best friend and I stumbled on a historical cemetery. The majority of Graves are from the 1860-1880 time period, some being pioneers of the town, and most of the Graves being people who died in winter or in the nearby mine. The cemetery has a few \"sections\" though they are scattered about, with the oldest being near the mine. Sections easily distinguished by the direction of headstones and plot/no plot areas, as well as time period (surprisingly there are some Graves from the 2000's but very few. Like 3.)\n\nAbout 2 months after initial discovery I took a date there late at night because she didn't believe it existed (no we didn't fuck in the graveyard). Well the second we walked in at night I could tell the place was Haunted. Eerily quiet , it definitely felt like we had been transported back in time. The whole place held its breath for us , and there were no bug or animal noises , despite hearing them in droves when in the parking lot. \n\nWhen I got home , I looked up the cemetery and there are countless reports of paranormal activity. \n\nDilemma : \n\nI'd like to do an investigation / try to gather some of my own evidence in springtime at this cemetery (it's brutally cold up there now). \n\nMy goal would be to go with my friend from the initial discovery , setup a nice camera (Canon DSLR) and leave it running on a tripod for most of the night. On top of that, walk around with my phone recording for an hour or so , positioned sort of like a body cam at chest-height. Then come back in the morning and review footage the next day. \n\nI dont exactly have any intention of trying to antagonize , bait , or entice spirits from their rest. I think there is enough activity-apparent to avoid these tactics, especially being that it's my first delve into this. \n\nQuestions : \n\nDoes this sound like a reasonable start ? \n\nWhat advice would you give to a beginner ? \n\nWhat sort of goal should I have for a mostly historical and non-malevolent cemetery ? \n\nHow did you get started with investigating the paranormal?",

        "text": "Idk I'm bored so I'll just tell a boring ass story. In my city there are 2 main abandoned buildings. The hilden mill, and the abandoned offices. The mill had a massive fire which was tragic seeing as it was a main building in the linen industry, which is what my city is known for. I went there 3 days ago, and saw some figures. This freaks me out because there was someone who tragically hung the self in there. It's also supposedly haunted. The thing is I'm skeptical if the mill is haunted, the abandoned offices seem more haunted to me.  I went to the offices at night about 2 months ago, and had a terrifying experience, I'm talking I caught a figure in video, and irl I heard voices and footsteps in there. I went again with a friend, for 10 minutes then we fled. He saw a figure standing in a room we walked past. Then, finally, we went again at day to see if it was just the night making us paranoid. It wasn't. We were on the bottom floor, and at the same time we saw 2 figures. I was looking behind me and saw a figure about 9ft tall right behind me in a room extremely close to me. He saw a small childlike figure run across the hall at the same time, which is scary as the figure we saw in the room at night was a child. There was also a fire in there and multiple people apparently died. Then, 1 last time he and some friends went back at night, I didn't go as I'm a lazy pos and was asleep. They apparently heard multiple bangs downstairs, voices/screams and the childlike figure again. What do you guys think? Should I go back and get video evidence? Or leave it Thanks for reading if you did.",

I am freaking out because this lasts for a really long time and I am questioning my sanity at this point. Does anyone know how to stop this or what is going on because the whole day today I had no energy and I felt like my energy was completely drained.

Anyway, so I’ve been hearing noises in my room more specifically like stuff is moving around and it only happens in the night or the middle of the night. I don’t know where the noise comes from I think from under my bed since I have stuff under their, but I’m not that sure, I literally checked under my bed and nothing looks moved or out of the ordinary, everything is the same, next place I thought it would come from is my closet but again nothing looks moved, now I forgot to mention but I share my room with my younger sister,but she doesn’t sleep there and sleeps my my mom, she also has stuff under her bed, but nothing that would make the specific noise. Another possibility is maybe a animal is inside the walls or in the ceiling, but I’m not sure since I can hear it very clearly like it’s under my sister’s bed. I remember literally today I was talking to my sister about it, because last night I heard like someone was moving stuff in my room noise and she told me that one morning she walked past my room and heard like someone was moving stuff around, and said that she peaked in my room and saw that I was sleeping. Maybe I’m just hearing things, but either way it’s starting to scare me Not sure if this is anything paranormal, but I really needed to get it off my chest.

To me they were real People who worked in our house (wealthy family) and it would freak my family out. I have had a few encounters since then, but we No longer have any connection to the house. Im still undecided whether these encounters are connected. On to todays topic. I have been so used to these things happening in my life that I dont notice until Someone points it out. Usually when I Cook the utensils im using will sort of fly off the bench. Ill think to myself \"thats weird but its probably Just the surface being too smooth etc). I never leave utensils close to the edge or anything but it will still fly off. My phone will also fall on the floor even if its in the middle of the table. Im so used to this happening I dont even react anymore. I had a meeting at work today, my phone was literarly laying in the middle of the table as i got up to get Coffee. I turn around and my phone is flying off the table. The whole meeting stops and people are trying to figure out whats happend. Nobody was close to the table, nobody touched it, it Just flew off. I realised that it wasnt normal, and the fact i didnt even try to figure it out kind of gave my colleages a pussled look. I do feel  a presence, but ive felt that all my life and to me thats Just how life is. Today made me realise that maybe something is with me. I dont know if its an evil presence, because it doesnt feel that way. Should I be worried? Is there anything I can do to figure out what this might be? Can I help it in some way? A part of me is feeling guilty, like maybe ive been ignoring someone trying to reach out for help, or maybe even Someone trying to help me? There are plenty of times i dont feel alone, even though i technically am, but most People feel like this right? Sorry for the short post, if you need some more background or anything from past \"encounters\" Just let me know.",

        "text": "So, in September of 2022 I visited Italy for the first time. I traveled to several of the famous cities including Venice, Verona and finally Rome. I am fascinated by ancient history so this was the section of the trip which I had the highest anticipation for. My passion for Rome in particular grew through a close friend with similar historical interest, who has run the Rome marathon many times and introduced me to the \"Stone Tape\" theory. More on that later. So anyway, on the second day of my visit to Rome, my girlfriend and I decided to head for the Colosseum. As expected, it was a fascinating experience, slightly dampened by the sheer number of tourists, but we were adding to that problem so I can hardly complain. For anyone who has visited the Colosseum, you will know that there is a fixed path which funnels visitors through the various levels of the structure in one direction. Nothing strange or startling occurred until near the end of the tour when we had just passed the gift shop. We were walking down a curved corridor on the second level towards the exit and I was looking through the archways across at the mostly destroyed stands on the other side of the arena. My view was of course obstructed by each pillar that we passed. Suddenly, as my view swept past one pillar, I saw what I can only describe as a lively, bustling group of people in the stands. It was like viewing the crowd of a football game from a distance. It was so quick because as I passed the next pillar and saw into the next archway they were gone. I remember stopping in my tracks, shaking my head and thinking \"No way, impossible\". As we walked through the rest of the building, I didn't take much in. My mind was on a discussion I had had with my close friend about his experience when visiting the arena. He described his profound sense of sorrow and a sensation like he was \"walking through treacle\" when he visited the site. He theorised that perhaps in areas where vast amounts of death and suffering had occurred, some residue of this energy was left behind. I'm sure I don't need to butcher the \"Stone Tape\" theory any further as most on this subreddit are probably familiar with it anyway. But yeah, that's my strange little \"timeslip\" experience in Rome.",

It was very brief, maybe like a second or two. I looked everywhere for the source or some plausible explanation. There's no A/C vent in the kitchen and no fans besides the vent fan above the oven, which was behind me and turned off. We've lived here over a year, and nothing like that has ever happened before. I was totally sober when this happened.\n\nThe scratch incident:\n\nOn Christmas Eve my fiance and I had some drinks. We were intoxicated, but not to the point of being uncoordinated/clumsy/slurring while talking/etc. I was in the bathroom washing my hands and heard him yelp/fall against the wall right outside the bathroom. I rushed out to check on him, and he was very shaken. He said he was trying to walk into the kitchen, then it felt like something pushed him into the wall. I pointed out that he had a large scratch across his chest (four red lines extending from the top of his left shoulder to his right armpit; skin was not broken). This made him scared, but he rationalized it and explained it away saying he probably did it to himself somehow while falling and probably just lost his balance. It seems odd though because when a person falls, their arms reach out to grab something instead of grabbing their own body. I took pictures because I've recently started documenting odd marks that show up on myself (red grid mark phenomenon, odd bruises, scoop marks) and want to track any odd marks he gets too. These are the first marks that have shown up on him.\n\nHe used to have this shadow person/entity that followed him wherever he lived and seemed to want to do him harm. He hasn't seen it again since we got together a couple years ago. He had a near death experience that put him in the hospital for awhile, and while there he saw people who turned out to be dead. One of them was another woman who had been in the hospital the same time he was, and died the day he saw her. I think the others were dead relatives/friends of his and people he didn't know.\n\nAt our last apartment on Halloween night, our security camera captured our cat looking at an orb and an object randomly falling off the wall. Other minor things happen that may or may not be paranormal. The camera has motion detection and person detection, and often labels things as a person when there's nothing there and no motion on the footage. My clothes and jewelry go missing all the time. I often never find the clothes again, but I'll find jewelry in odd places. Other items going missing and reappearing in odd places. Food seems to spoil/go bad faster than it should. Random messes appear and things fall off the walls without explanation. We have cats, but this occurs in places they can't access (inside the fridge, cabinets, closets, shelves and high places they can't reach, etc). Clicking/cracking/tapping noises on the windows (we're on the 2nd floor). Ringing/high pitched noises we both can hear. Cats staring at things/following things with their eyes that we don't see.",

        "text": "I wrote this last night and stupidly posted in a mediumship forum, as I am a medium. I am a lot more experienced now, and won't go into these woods now this late at night.\n\nSo, allow me to preface by saying, I am of Cherokee ancestry. So, I have assumed in some way, this experience is linked to my ancestry. But it can also be linked to the land attempting to protect two innocent and stupid young adults. \n\nWhen I was 21, I decided, along with a friend to go \"ghost hunting\" at the local sanatorium in Madison, WI. In the woods out back. This was back when Ghost Adventures was just getting big. I was pretty Empathic, but at the time, that was about it. \n\nSo we enter the woods. And enter a clearing. On the recorder, I picked up this demonic voice saying \"I'm gonna get ya.\" Its a chilling recording. \n\nIts a hot summer night, the clearing is warm. We talk for awhile to whatever is there. And then suddenly, it's not so warm anymore... It's freezing cold and pitch black. Like we can see our breath, cold. I even put my hand in front of me to see if I can see it, that's how dark it is. I look up and I can't even see the trees, it's so dark.\n\nThe negative energy was oppressive. I didn't like it. From the distance, both my friend and I begin to hear the sound of Native American War Drums. At first they're faint, then they're getting closer. \n\nThe overwhelming darkness begins to back off. As the darkness leaves the clearing I follow the ground to the woods- and look up to see a family of deer; complete with a buck, fawn and doe. \n\nIt took me awhile to figure out what was so off about them. It wasn't that they weren't breathing. That they weren't running, that they weren't moving. \n\nThey were spirits. Straight up grey/white. With black eyes. Immediately, I was overcome with such dread, not at the animals, but at whatever it was I could hear behind us. Whatever had leaves and twigs crunching under it's feet. The doe nodded at me.\n\nA rush of wind kicked up around us. \n\nThe drums were now at an all time high, that, and the chanting was stoking an urgency in my veins that made me grab my friend and run away. \n\nI checked in with my friend tonight to confirm the details of this story, as it happened 10+ years ago. She remembers all the same things. I remember there also being an owl and a squirrel. I later found out this was the site of one of the Native American Wars. \n\nAfter doing some research, I believe I saw Totems sent to protect me and my friend, or guard the land. Whether they were from my tribe or the ones that died there, I don't know. I'm just wondering what anyone else here thinks.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something similar in those woods? My friend and I believe someone was possibly there to harm us. Possibly a person drawn to dark energy. I'm not sure. All I can say, is that she and I 100% heard and saw the same things. And it's absolutely the most vivid paranormal experience I've ever had. It sounded like an entire Native American Army going to war. \n\nAlso, at the time, there were no events scheduled to explain this drumming.",

        "text": "This happened last Thursday and I’ve been mulling the situation over in my head ever since. Maybe you guys have some helpful theories?\n\nSo some necessary background: My husband, kids and I live in a single family home in your average American middle class neighborhood. Our house was built in the early 1990s and we bought it from the original homeowners. We’ve lived here for a few years and everything’s been great in that way. The house is a colonial style with an attached garage that leads into the kitchen by a short hallway. \n\nI’m unable to work due to chronic illness so I stay home during the day. Most weekdays my husband is able to come home for a quick lunch around 12:30. He also always enters through the garage. Mind you, our garage door is so loud the rumble is audible through the entire house while it opens and shuts.\n\nLast week, I was working on a sewing project at the kitchen table. I had music quietly playing and I was in the process of cutting out a pattern so large that I had to lay it out on the floor. I was kneeling over the fabric looking down, when I heard footsteps coming from our back hall area into the kitchen. The person stopped a few feet from me as I could see their shape and I heard a man say, “Oh… hey!” \n\nThis happened quickly enough that I startled and replied automatically, “You snuck up on me!!” as I assumed it was my husband home for lunch. Without looking up, I told him that I’d be off the floor momentarily, as soon as I finished cutting my piece. \n\nI then heard him walk around the corner towards his office. It felt too early for him to be home, so I checked the time and it was only 10:45. I turned off my music to call out to him and got no response. I spent 10 minutes calling out and looking for him, but he wasn’t home. \n\nMy next logical thought was that a burglar broke in…  but I had already searched the house looking for my husband and no one was there but me.\n\nI didn’t hear the garage door or any exterior door open or shut. Which is why I was initially startled when the man walked in and spoke.\n\n*I could hear the footsteps, and I could see a man standing there in my peripheral vision. I could feel someone standing there in the room with me.\nHe had a deep baritone voice and sounded surprised to see me. I heard him walk away and felt him leave the kitchen.*\n\nMy husband came home for lunch that day. The first thing I asked was if he came home earlier for a few minutes. Nope, he was in a meeting. Then he did a burglar re-check.\n\nI’m not sure what I experienced? It was definitely weird and possibly paranormal.",

After a few hours my mom called me to go home, so I had to hurry. \n\nI chose a shorter path, which I usually wouldn’t, because it’s a dark street with a few lights. Tbh I always had goosebumps from that street, but I had to be home in time. \n\nI was fast walking, so I was a few steps ahead of my friend, then I had a feeling that somebody is watching me. I looked beside me and I saw something, which I will never forget. \n\nThere was a school next to me, where I saw a man WITHOUT A HEAD. It was sitting on a bench, wearing a black suit. It was huge, with long legs and it doesn’t even had a neck, only shoulders. Although the entity doesn’t had a head, I felt his gaze on me. I was not able to move or talk, only to stare at him. It felt like minutes, but it was only a few seconds, when I heard my friend calling me. I started to run without a word, when I noticed she is not following me. I looked back and she was staring at that thing, I screamed at her to run and she followed.\n\nWe were running for our lives without a word. When we were in front of my house, I asked her what did she saw and her reply was “a man without a head”, she saw exactly the same thing as me. Next day we visited the school and there was NO BENCH there.\n\nWe are 22 by now and we still don’t know  what did we saw at that night. \n\n(Sorry for any mistakes, English is not my first language)",

        "text": "This feels so incredibly strange to write, but I legitimately think I might be haunted or cursed.\n\nAll my life since I was a kid, I used to have nightmares of Chucky, Darth Mal, etc. Usual stuff from watching movies at a young age, but then it progressed.\n\nThe first experience I had with something terrifying was in the fifth grade. I slept like normal but woke up around 4:30a.m. As I often tossed and turned. I looked across my bedroom and saw a black shape in the shape of a man with no face, except for gleaming white eyes and teeth. He just stared and smiled at me before I was terrified and pulled the covers over my head and prayed. The next morning I swear I saw a lingering footprint in the hall carpet in the shape of a foot, but when we looked, no intruders had been in the home. We used Holy Water throughout the entire house and prayed and that entity seemed to just leave. Things were fine.\n\nA few years ago, my family and I were devastated by a major natural disaster that forced us to temporarily relocate out of our home. We moved into an apartment, *and this is where my current situation starts*.\n\nOne night after a long day of college, I fell asleep around 10:30p.m. Just from pure exhaustion. I fell deep asleep and dreamt that I was in my old neighbors’ house. She was an old Italian woman who had recently passed away, but my family and her always gotten along really well. Anyways, I dreamt that I was in her living room and she was sitting on her sofa, watching television as she usually did when I would stop by. She asked me to sit down and watch television with her, which I obliged, only to discover that she was watching a screen full of static and white noise. It was so bizarre.\n\nOut of nowhere, I heard the whirring and whizzing of the white noise go from my right ear to my left and that’s when I heard the witch. An old, decrepit voice spoke to me as it passed behind the couch, and behind me. *I’m going to get you, YOU’RE NEXT!* is whispered harshly into my ears. I was frozen with fear, and immediately I woke up in a state of sleep paralysis.\n\nThat was six years ago, and ever since then I’ve had occasional nightmares whenever I sleep in my bedroom. I’m currently set to move out from my parents place soon, but my dreams usually consist of me being in my room with my childhood furniture and room arrangement. Something will knock some books down and it’ll spook me a bit, but my last two nightmares are terrifying me.\n\nAbout two months ago, I had a dream that an invisible entity was haunting me in my room. Moving furniture, knocking down books from my bookcase, etc. I resorted to calling for my grandmother, who used to comfort me as I child whenever I had nightmares. She came into my bedroom (in my dream) and asked me what was wrong? I told her about the paranormal activity, but she blew it off and told me it was nothing. I woke up right after and things were fine, just a dream.\n\nHere is where shit is starting to get really weird, and my family and I are absolutely baffled. I just woke up about 30 minutes ago from my most recent nightmare and here’s why I’m writing this post:\n\nI was in my bedroom with the lights still on and my pet cat in my room with me. I swear that in my dream, something opened my bedroom door as if it were entering my mind/dream. It then started to open and close drawers to my old TV stand and sling books off of the bookcase very slowly. My cat kept trying to interact with the invisible entity, but it didn’t like that, if fact, it actually picked her up like 3 times as if trying to get her to stop. Additionally, I just tried to sleep and ignore the entity, which it didn’t like. So it decided to sit on the edge of my bed, and *I LITERALLY ROLLED FORWARD FROM THE WEIGHT OF THIS THING SITTING ON MY BED. It was so bizarre!!!\n\nAgain, I called for my grandmother (in my dream) to come and comfort me and explain what was happening. As I was explaining to her what was happening, *the door to my bedroom closed on its own*. I told my grandmother that the door just closed by itself, but she was pretty nonchalant about it, but then the invisible entity slid open a drawer from my old TV stand and started pulling papers out, before slamming it shut with my grandmother and I both watching. We were both stunned, and so I told the entity to go away, and it did! \n\nHere’s the thing that’s making me feel like this is more than just a nightmare problem going on.\n\nAfter I woke up from this nightmare, I sat in my bed and I yelled for my grandmother at the top of my lungs six times. Usually, she would come bolting into my room and hear me immediately, but she didn’t this morning even thought she’s just 10 feet down the hall and we have thin insulation. I got legitimately worried. It felt like something was wrong.\n\nMy grandfather heard me and asked me what was wrong. I sprung out of bed and went to share with him the same thing I typed here, and he said it’s okay, it was just a dream. I told him that I had to go speak with my grandmother as something didn’t feel right. I go to my grandmothers room and she’s awake, still in her bed. I ask her why she didn’t come to my room whenever I called her, and she said that she didn’t hear me.\n\nI told her it was impossible to not hear me, that I probably could have been heard throughout the entire house, especially if she was awake. She told me that she had been awake for awhile now and didn’t hear a thing from me or my room, so I went back and I re-enacted my yelling to show her how loud I was and now she heard me.\n\nI legitimately feel like this entity left my actually bedroom and went to my grandmothers and it blocked her from being able to hear me. I really feel like something is wrong or afoot here beyond just some bad dreams. I’m pretty petrified, and like I said, it’s really starting to get bizarre and even my grandparents are confused as to why she didn’t hear me the first time.\n\nSo um, yeah. What do I do? What do you guys recommend? I am just at a loss and feel like this is really the chilly beginning to something more sinister.",

Someone saying \"hey\" , Someone touches my shoulder. Someone jumping on my sofa. Lots of reflections, flashes of light, I have seen 2 apparitions. 1 was just a face of a girl phasing out next to me and the other was a 10 ft tall demon phasing out of view. I am getting shadow figures peeping around corners, some whispering, knocks. Heat spots &amp; cold spots. I've got the whole 9 yards. It's rather terrifying because in 2015 I received my first and only telepathic message that told me in a man's voice I am going to hell. \n   The thing is, is that it all feels like contrived and controlled  holograms and electronic, psychological warfare. I don't really think I'm haunted. I feel like it's just another phase of the research. I am scared. I need ideas. I don't want to be scared. I am calm but confused. I know this all sounds unbelievable but it's absolutely my truth.",

I dont want to bore you with too much unimportant  information but the easiest way for me to describe it is as if i have a sixth sense for the universe.\n\n I'm not the religious type if that's what you are wondering. But i can say with confidence that god exists. Now the only thing left is how do i convince anyone that i have this feeling. \n\nThe short answer is I can't. I can't explain this feeling to anyone because it is just that. A feeling ,it's the same as if trying to describe taste to someone who can't feel taste. It's been weighing on my mind lately so much.\n\n I'm living my regular life as if nothing special is happening when i in fact can feel the freaking universe. I don't dable with drugs either so it's not like i am going coco crazy or anything. Actually when i hear people talk about drugs especially something crazy strong (like DMT) it kinda reminds me of this feeling i have. \n\nI don't suspect that anyone will actually believe me since i myself wouldn't believe me. I thought maybe I'm losing my mind,but I've had this feeling since i was born which would mean I've lost my mind since the day i could breathe air.\n\nThe worst part about this is I can't even ask anyone for help around this topic It's not like anyone has knowledge around this topic . And i wouldn't like to trust too much to religious texts . \n\nThe sceptics on this subreddit will ignore me while the people which are a bit more suggestible will start sending me dm's.\n\nI guess I'm writing this as a sort of self therapy. If you have any questions please be free to ask. Now i must let you know that this is just a sense or a feeling that i have.and i will try to explain anything i can in the best way i can ... Remember its hard to describe color to a blind person.\n\nI guess for now the only nice part about this is that i know for sure that god does exist in whatever form that he is in.\n\nBut it does leave me wondering why create anything in the first place . Maybe he wants true randomness.or maybe he isn't as perfect as we think  he is. Also i just want to say that im using a he for god just to make everyone else here familiar even tho i myself think it's an it",

        "text": "Since i posted my past story here, it triggered a memory of another really weird thing that happened to me when I was around 7-8 years old. The house i was living in at the time was really creepy. I’d hear random thumps down the hallway at night, see shadows move out of the corner of my eye, and i swear i saw a beast of some sort in the woods next to the house, but my parents insisted it was my young imagination.\n\nMy bedroom was small, but i had the bed along the back wall where there was a really large window. The window had wooden blinds that i’d never shut because i used to like the sun waking me up in the morning, and i was terrified of the dark so i loved having the moonlight come through the blinds and illuminate my room. i went to bed like normal one night, and remember waking up at some odd hour and my room was pitch black, like pure pitch black. i thought maybe i was dreaming, so i hit myself and instead just hurt myself and didn’t wake myself up from the dream i thought i was in. I felt my way up to and peeked out the blinds, and i couldn’t see anything. The moon would generally light up the whole back area, but there was nothing. just pure pitch blackness. \n\nI was scared of the dark, but for some reason, i wasn’t scared of this. Instead, i got myself up out of bed and slowly felt around in the darkness and found my light switch, which wouldn’t turn on. Then i opened the door and looked down the hallway, yet again just pitch blackness. I slowly walked down the hallway and it was deafeningly silent, but i wasn’t scared. i felt my way out into the really living room where we had about four sliding glass doors. There was no light coming from anywhere outside, and not even any light coming from the electronics. This was really strange as I used to come out for water during the night all the time, and I’d always had the moon to light the way for me. But that night, there was just nothing. \n\nI opened the fridge which let light into the living room, and when I looked over to one of the doors with the light now shining, i saw a pair of glowing white eyes. me being a kid, i thought it was the fridge light and shut the fridge door, which in turn left me again in the pitch black, but those eyes remained in place. \nThey weren’t there before when i walked up to the windows to try and see outside, and i remember feeling this dreadful and scared feeling like i needed to get back to bed. I slowly felt my way back down the hallway and managed to find my way back to my bed. I remember feeling safe once i got there, and i fell back asleep. I tried to tell my parents the next morning, but they insisted that I was dreaming. I know i wasn’t dreaming, because I remember the fear i felt when i saw those black eyes. I’ve had lucid dreams before and I’ve been able to control my dreams from a young age, and I know for a fact this wasn’t a lucid dream. I don’t know why i wasn’t scared, because if that were me now i’d be terrified.",

        "text": "Quite fittingly, it was Halloween night, ( I think two years ago,) and I was either sitting or standing in the kitchen. You see, from the kitchen of my house, you have a direct line of sight to the front door on the right. And at the time, we had no decals up, so the window was almost entirely see through. My little brother was directly in front of the kitchen, in either the dining room or living room. There’s also a small hall that leads to the front door, and a wall, separating where my brother was positioned, ( keep this in mind.) So, there I was in the kitchen, and that’s when I decided to look up at the front door window for no apparent reason. And I see what looked to me at the time, a reflection of my brother’s face on the window. The supposed, “ reflection,” stared directly at me, then slowly but sternly moved it’s head to the right, ( my left.) Still thinking it was merely my brother’s reflection, I called for him, and tried to get him to position himself literally anywhere. Anywhere in the living or dining room. And no matter where he was, we could never imitate what I’d just saw. No, I have a very different assumption about what I saw that day. My immediate family and I all believe that what I saw was some sort of demon, or evil spirit. And that it was trying to trick me into thinking that my poor brother was locked outside and needed help I.e., needed me to open the front door. I don’t like thinking about what could’ve happened if I’d have opened that door. And let whatever was behind that glass inside our home.",

        "text": "This happened when I was about ten years old, living with my grandparents in their house with my mother and little sister as the result of a messy divorce.\n\nAlmost everybody who's been in and out of that house before has some sort of paranormal experience to share, and I have a dozen of my own, but this was my most direct and obvious, and the one that's stuck with me the most.\n\nWe had our beds and all our stuff in \"the back room\", which had a door leading into a small hallway that had a sink with a large mirror, a bathroom, and a wooden, dusty old sauna and bathtub at the very end that were both now used for keeping junk. I could never sleep with that door open without getting nightmares and feeling this horrible, oppressive presence. I know *something* lives back there, but I don't think I'll ever get the chance to figure out what. I think the fact that we were so close to this hallway had something to do with what I'm about to describe. \n\nSo me and my little sister had a large mutt of a dog called Penny, who was an absolute sweetheart. My grandpa didn't like her at all though, and insisted upon making her an outside dog. He would literally throw her outside whenever she tried to stick her nose in through the backyard door. Living in Nevada, during the peak of summer, one day we found her lying on the concrete near her kennel, dead for God knows how long from heatstroke. \n\nIt was a horrible day. My grandpa and my mom wrapped her up in a towel, stuck her in the back of the van and took her wherever you take dead dogs. The memories are blurry, but they were both insist that me and my sister stay back with my grandma. \n\nThat night, I went to sleep in my mom's bed. After a while, as I was a kicker, she kicked me out and tucked me into my own bed.\n\nI don't remember falling asleep. The very next thing I remember is lying on my bed, staring at the roof with this overwhelming feeling of despair sitting on my chest. It was almost hard to breath, with how horrible I felt. Then, I hear Penny walking on the carpeted floor, her breathing, the sound of her paws, everything is *her*. My hand is hanging off of the bed, and she puts her nose into it, almost nuzzling it, and whines. The weight comes off of my chest and I remember smiling a little, and calling her a good girl.\n\nThen, she was gone. I woke up crying, so hard I almost couldn't breath again.\n\nThere's my memory. I don't think it was really a dream, and my grandma says to this day she wanted to say goodbye to me. I knew Penny was hurting before she died, and I like to think this was her telling me that she's okay, she loves me, and she's leaving now. \n\nI wish I had more time with her. We had Penny for less than 2 years, but I'll never forget my girl.",

But since returning, we have experienced….unusual occurrences around the house. Really skipping a lot of scientifically explainable events here, but it was enough to have my fiancés family want us to light some candles. Any time we light a candle in the bedroom, it really bounces, almost going out repeatedly, and at one point split into two. The flame is legit fighting for it’s life, both the first and second candle. No air flow at all in the room. The kitchen candle is mostly unmoving.",

I wasn't scared, just bewildered having never seen something like that before but I'm sure that's what it was. Not on hands and knees, but flat on it's feet, I only caught a glimpse of the backside, it's rear was slightly below the door handle. When he stands up to investigate a shuffle comes from the hall but nothing's there.\n\nHe taunts it, then comes to lay with me again.\n\nNow I was scared.\n\nA friend of ours told me she had seen spirits that follow him, I'm a little sensitive to spirits myself but I'm a feeler if that makes sense. At his house I don't sleep soundly, sleep talking often when at my house we both rest easy which is another off-putting note.\n\nI can't find much about the crawly dude, but I fear it's,,, demonic in nature and that thought terrifies me since we're a long way from moving out together and I don't want him living with that yk?\n\nShould I cleanse his house? I've cleansed and put protections up when my mom had an encounter and she's been fine since is that the play or is this something stronger?\n\nBig preesh",

I always check my clock every he does this and it was almost 7am.  Later that day, I mentioned this occurrence and he says it wasn’t him.  Two days ago I hear steps going down again, this time at 2 am, bc I always  check my clock.  Again not him.  Today he told me that he thought I came into his room around 11pm last night and cuddled him, to the point where he shook his left hand and said “that’s enough!”   He then reached over and felt nothing.  This was from the wall side of his room.   Neither of have felt negative energy, if not more of a loving feeling from this interaction.  What could it be and how can we reduce interactions?

        "text": "There was a haunted house my family used to live in. Me and my brother were too young to remember anything, but my parents sure as hell remembered. I don’t know the exact location but it was somewhere in Fort, Texas. My mom and dad never really believed in this kind of stuff at the time but that changed when they experienced the incidents in the house. \n\nMy mom mentioned my brother’s room and how my brother was never able to sleep in it. He would always scream and cry about a scary man trying to get him while trying to get out of the room. So my mom ended up moving his bed into my bedroom. After thinking for a while she decided to experiment by sleeping in my brother’s room to see the fuss. While she tried sleeping in that room she could feel a sense of dread and felt uncomfortable. After she couldn’t sleep she went back to her room. \n\nThen one time, she caught me and my brother talking to someone and asked who we were talking to and we said ‘The tall man in the closet wants to play bongtae*?’ \n\nAnother thing my mom experienced was one time where my dad was already asleep and my mom then saw a shadowy figure come up to her and start choking her. While she was struggling to escape she hit my dad thus waking him up. While I’m not sure if the imaginary friend and the shadow person are related, this definitely freaked my mom out. I asked my dad about it as well and he said he barely remembers living there and just knows he felt weirdly angry all the time at the house.\n\nMy mom was tired of it so she finally searched up the history of the house and she figured out it was built on an Indian burial. I just asked her cause I’ve heard about that house many times before.",

        "text": "When I was in my 20s I spent a lot of time at greyhound stations coming and going. The story begins with smoking. At the greyhound station in LA the smoking section is all of outside in front of the station near the parking lot. I was smoking a bowl of weed, this dude came up to me, and sort of a private person so I didn’t really look up too quick, you kinda have to keep to yourself in those places. This guy asked me for a lighter and I handed it over, he lit a joint and passed it to me. By this time you’re accompanying the person you’re smoking with, i suddenly got really paranoid (could have been the weed, or just how obvious we were about it) but I finally looked at the guy I was smoking with and his entire face was basically melted, like he was burned. At first internally, I flinched, but was not rude about it. Finished the joint and we both went back in. His bus was on the far left and mine on the far right. My bus was boarding people and I was standing in line. There was a camera above the door we were lined up at, and a TV displaying the feed. I jokingly put two fingers above my head like horns, then came a blood curdling scream from “burnt guys” side of the station. Everyone’s attention was to that side of the station. My line was already moving and almost through the doors. I turned back and there looked like a 7 foot tall man sitting on one of the seats, full leathers and jeans, like a hardcore biker. Black sunglasses, a cane, giant leather boots and a goatee. Must have been at least 300-400 pounds, but not fat, I never seen anyone that size in all my life, like way too big to be real or not noticed before hand. I felt him staring at me, now almost standing in the door way, I looked back again, at that moment a family toting luggage walked by and blocked my view, gave my ticket to the driver and looked back, the giant man was gone, and the seat empty. Heart pumping I got onto the bus and was driven to my next destination.",
