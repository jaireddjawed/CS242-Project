My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*\n\nWhy is knowledge so important to us? Why do some individuals devote their entire lives to seeking knowledge and understanding? While the pursuit of knowledge appears to be intrinsic to our nature, delving deeper into this question might help us understand ourselves better. Here are some potential reasons for its significance:  \n\n1. To survive, one must have knowledge and understanding. Our brains are wired with a natural curiosity, a drive to comprehend that can become more active with regular exercise, sometimes even reaching the level of obsession.  \n\n2. One way to further our career both socially and financially is to provide a service to others in our community, utilizing our specific area of wisdom and capability. This can result in valuable social relationships, increased status, and the receipt of reciprocal services. Essentially, our knowledge and understanding in a particular field can serve as a pathway to success.\n\n3. We enjoy solving problems and overcoming challenges. The pursuit of knowledge, breaking down barriers, or solving logical puzzles stimulates our brains and provides immense pleasure.\n\n4. Ideas expressed by phrases such as \"truth,\" \"fundamental reality,\" \"ultimate cause,\" and other similar expressions provide us with a feeling of making contact with a realm of existence that surpasses our daily lives. Our basic needs appear to be fleeting, existing one moment and disappearing the next. Acquiring higher knowledge or understanding mathematical truths is a means for us to engage in pursuits that are eternal. This imbues our lives with purpose and meaning; what we are doing will exist in some form forever.\n\nThese various factors influence our motivations to different degrees, which can result in a wide range of behaviors during the process of learning or utilizing knowledge. It may appear at times that we argue solely to establish our superiority over others. Occasionally, we may only seek knowledge for its practical applications and dismiss knowledge that seems irrelevant. Alternatively, we may be driven purely by the quest of truth.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1678708569.0},{"title":"Meet the clown with a show about the Holocaust","author":"DrMontalban","url":"https:\/\/forward.com\/culture\/539519\/holocaust-clown-show-alexandra-tatarsky-sad-boys-in-harpy-land\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678725469.0},{"title":"What Is Chok?","author":"Friar_Rube","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Judaism\/comments\/11q5tj9\/what_is_chok\/","text":"I've always been taught that chok is some sort of \"inexplicable\" law that exists only to test our relationship with God.

It also conflates many types of antisemitic rhetoric with mere \"criticism of Israel\".\n\nI thought Hirsh's article was a fascinating read, but it missed a phenomenon that's common in modern discourse: the preemptive \"Now you're gonna call me antisemitic\" followed immediately by either an anti-Jewish or anti-Israel sentiment.\n\nI've personally witnessed many cases where someone will accompany antisemitic or anti-Israel statements with disclaimers that the person making these statements is not antisemitic - or, more aggressively, asserting that others will wrongly accuse this person of antisemitism. \n\nThe funny thing is that I see this type of defensive announcement uttered a lot more often than I do actual accusations of antisemitism.

I\u2019ve heard several suggested reasons for them, but none of them sounded sensible to me. A while ago I discovered this account of the communal practice of Dembitz (D\u0119bica), Poland, which IMO contains something of an explanation. It can be found in this translation of Dembitz\u2019s yizkor book: [The Baking of Matza Shmura by Yehuda Pechter](https:\/\/www.jewishgen.org\/yizkor\/debica\/dem041.html#r72)\n\nHere\u2019s the text, followed by my interpretation of its significance:\n> Grandfather brought the wheat home in that cloth, and later placed it in a special place in the attic of the Hassidic Beis Midrash, next to the house of the Tzadik Rabbi Alter Pechter of blessed memory. There, grandfather spread out the wheat onto well laundered white sheets with his own hands in order to dry it properly. Only between Purim and Passover, once they had dried completely, did he sort out the \u201cheads of garlic\u201d, which were also considered to be complete actual chometz, and those who were extremely meticulous in the performance of the commandments would be very careful that not one \u201cfinger\u201d should be found among the wheat that is being prepared for the matza shmura.\n\nI think this passage is relevant to the custom of avoiding *actual* garlic. The wheat kernels described here are probably ones which had become damp and had therefore sprouted or become subject to fungal growth, and consequently unsuitable for matza. But I have observed that stringencies on Pesach often develop around things that are even *verbally* associated with chametz. In this case, wheat that was \u201ca head of garlic\u201d was considered to be chametz: by a verbal similarity actual heads of garlic were forbidden as well. We shouldn\u2019t imagine that this was an error or due to some sort of imagined contagion: as the account says, the job of sorting wheat was one entrusted to relatively few people in the Jewish community, and probably never to more than one or two in a village. How could the traditions relating to it be passed on? By encoding it verbally. The identification of \u201cheads of garlic\u201d in wheat was assissted and protected by the common understanding that garlic itself was not to be consumed on Pesach.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678662370.0},{"title":"the Jewish soul | rootsmetals","author":"ummmbacon","url":"https:\/\/www.rootsmetals.com\/blogs\/news\/the-jewish-soul","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1678673848.0},{"title":"Has anyone here read this book? i\u2019m looking to start learning more about Maimonides and wondering if you\u2019d recommend it.","author":"ShrekSeager123","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/hawzt5gmodna1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678639347.0},{"title":"Heinrich Graetz","author":"Hot_Kitchen1494","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Judaism\/comments\/11pvln0\/heinrich_graetz\/","text":"Is Heinrich Graetz considered a reliable source for Jewish history, in general and from an orthodox perspective?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678669277.0},{"title":"Emotional parts of the Torah?","author":"GoldWatchSelfie","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Judaism\/comments\/11poi5y\/emotional_parts_of_the_torah\/","text":"I had read the story of Joseph to my Son a few nights ago and he loved it!! \n\nI think it could quite possibly be my favorite story. \nSo I hung out today and decided to read his story again all they way up to his death.

My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*\n\nIt might be obvious that your family holds a special place in your heart, but there are various factors that contribute to these feelings of preference.  \n\n[Evolutionary psychology](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kin_selection) suggests that there is a genetic basis for our inclination to care for the well-being of our siblings or other close relatives. This is due to the fact that individuals share genes with their relatives, and by assisting them in surviving and reproducing, one can increase the likelihood of their own genes being passed down to future generations. Alternatively, some psychologists contend that behavioral patterns instilled during infancy predispose us to have a greater concern for our own family.  \n\nOne way to view this is by recognizing that we expand our ego and self-preservation instincts to encompass other individuals, such that we perceive them as representing ourselves. If a member of our family, tribe, or nation is endangered, it becomes a danger to our own being, by association.  \n\nAn alternative explanation is that our preference for family is a mutually beneficial arrangement based on convenience. People who are not related to us are less likely to provide us with help, so we tend to reciprocate with lower levels of commitment. However, families worldwide have an unspoken agreement that functions as a form of insurance: I assist my relatives, and they help me in return. This arrangement is so deeply ingrained that it has become an instinctual part of our behavior.\n\nAnother explanation for our impulse to help others is our innate drive to care for fellow human beings, and possibly even other forms of life. However, since it's not feasible to assist every single person, we must prioritize whom we help. This could be seen as a way for society to divide responsibilities. Someone must take on the task of assisting a particular individual. If you don't take care of a family member, for example, no one else will step in to do so. For someone who doesn't have any relatives, we are all responsible for looking after them. Therefore, you can't escape the responsibility of assisting them.  \n\nA cynic could respond that what truly matters to us is the abstract idea of family, ethnic group, or nation, rather than the actual individuals. As a result, we may be willing to put our lives on the line for our country, but feel little attachment to any of its citizens.  \n\nWhile there is limited concrete evidence to indicate the superiority of one explanation over the other, it is likely that the answer varies from person to person. Nonetheless, it might be valuable to consider which explanation you choose to prioritize. If your reasons for taking care of those in your immediate circle stem from their humanity rather than an abstract concept of the group, you are less likely to be blinded by favoritism towards your own people and more likely to recognize the humanity of those who are further removed.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678627818.0},{"title":"Did any of you attend Yeshiva University?

Chances are very few people see it.\n\n\nIt's a whole other story when an account with 10s of 1000s of followers AND a blue checkmark (whether bought or not) is spreading hate. There is one such account that Twitter should suspend ASAP. \n\n\nThe 21st Century Father Coughlin: his name is E. Michael Jones, a traditionalist Catholic writer who consistently promotes anti-Semitic tropes throughout his books, articles, and social media. His account, *@emichaeljones1* (www.twitter.com\/emichaeljones1), *has over 40K followers*, and the comments on his tweets are often more blatant than his statements.\nSince Kanye and Nick Fuentes have been suspended for anti-Semitic tweets, then Jones should also be banned from Twitter.\n\n\nHe is not unknown by any means. He routinely hurls accusations against the ADL, which identifies him on its site as a virulent anti-Semite: \"...a longstanding obsession of Jones is *the damage that he believes Jews are inflicting on the Catholic Church and western civilization*.\" In 2013, the ADL even published an official report on him: https:\/\/www.adl.org\/resources\/news\/e-michael-jones\n\n\nJones' magazine, \"Culture Wars\", was named by the SPLC to its 2007 list of \"12 Anti-Semitic Radical Traditonalist Catholic Groups\": https:\/\/www.splcenter.org\/fighting-hate\/intelligence-report\/2007\/12-anti-semitic-radical-traditionalist-catholic-groups\n\"...in 1996, Jones changed the name of his magazine to Culture Wars, and he has increasingly focused on the alleged evils of the Jews as he adds to his \"continuing series on the Jews.\" The magazine's cover stories over the last year or so are instructive: \"Judaizing: Then and Now,\" \"John Huss and the Jews,\" \"The Converso Problem: Then and Now,\" \"The Judaism of Hitler,\" \"Shylock Comes to Notre Dame\" and so on. Jones runs through all the usual anti-Semitic canards -- the ideas that \"Jewish media elites\" run the country, that Jews are \"major players\" in pornography, and that Jews are behind Masonry and the French Revolution -- but that's only the start. He also accuses Jews of poisoning society with thinkers such as Karl Marx (a devotee of Satan, says Jones) and Sigmund Freud (who set off an epidemic of sexual sin, he says). And *he describes the World War II Nazi genocide of the Jews as \"a reaction to Jewish Messianism* (in the form of Bolshevism).\" Last April, in an article raging about a new president of Notre Dame University, Jones charged that anyone who went to a mainstream university would emerge \"with a Jewish world view \u2026 and maybe a Jewish spouse.\"\"\n\nAre there other prominent anti-Semitic Twitter accounts boasting 1000s of followers? I would encourage anyone to report anti-Semitic tweets and accounts, especially prominent ones like Jones. It's likely not worthwhile to report anonymous anti-Semites who get suspended and then just register a new account with the same 10 followers. Someone with Jones' notoriety would not be able to evade a suspension so easily.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678545724.0},{"title":"I\u2019m looking to be more spiritual.

The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*\n\nWith AI becoming increasingly prevalent, we may be forced to make difficult decisions about whether to prioritize success at any cost, on the one hand or to avoid prejudice, on the other.  \n\nThere are two types of prejudice: one is a bias that asserts incorrect beliefs, while the other form of prejudice might be factually true but still leads to an unfair society.\n\nConsider a fictional society wherein the prevailing belief is that individuals with blue skin are greedy, and those with oversized ears are inherently violent.  \n\nOne possibility is that this is simply untrue, and that there is no correlation between blue skin and greed, or ear size and violence.  \n\nWe may prefer to view prejudice in this way because it portrays bias as both foolish and unpleasant, but it is important to acknowledge that prejudice is sometimes more complex than that.  \n\nWhat if statistics show beyond reasonable doubt that there is a correlation between being blue and exhibiting greed or having large ears and being prone to violence? What if these well-validated facts prove that blue people are three times more likely to be greedy, while large-eared individuals are four times more prone to violence? It's possible to argue that these statistics are a result of these minority groups responding to other prejudices they have faced. However, this argument fails to address the current issues. For instance, banks and police want to succeed and have hard facts to support their claims that taking precautions can improve their performance. They argue that their biases are based on truth, so why shouldn't they be permitted to take necessary precautions to succeed?\n\nThe counterargument is that prejudging individuals based on physical characteristics, such as blue skin or big ears, before they have actually done anything wrong constitutes prejudice. By doing so, we prevent these individuals from having the chance to prove themselves, creating an uneven playing field. It is not fair to deprive them of opportunity or make them bear the consequences of the actions of others who share their physical traits; perhaps they do not behave in the same way.\n\nAI exacerbates this problem by collecting and storing more data, making it easier to detect any patterns that may emerge. The common explanation that AI mirrors the false beliefs of the programmers or the views expressed on the internet is often an oversimplification. It is too easy and convenient to suggest that AI is driven solely by the false-beliefs definition of prejudice. We must acknowledge that in some cases, AI is prejudiced because the hard statistics demonstrate that its prejudices are based on truth.\n\nToday, we are faced with a difficult choice between two opposing values. On one hand, we believe that everyone has the right to succeed to the best of their ability, and if they have access to statistical tools that provide accurate evaluations, we should not intervene and prevent them from achieving success. On the other hand, we must consider ourselves as a society and decide whether we want to permit individuals in influential positions to deny innocent people the equal and fair opportunities they deserve.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678442745.0},{"title":"Does \u05e2\u05b8\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4 have any correspondence to the word Allah, \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u0670\u0647","author":"MuslimSkepticz","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Judaism\/comments\/11n7vvz\/does_\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4_have_any_correspondence_to_the_word\/","text":"I know many Christians like to claim that the word alah \u05e2\u05b8\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4 in Isaiah 14 is the name for God Allah, and by doing this they claim that Allah tried to ascend god, therefore they claim our religion is false.\n\nBut that word is Ayin, lamed, heh allah doesn\u2019t have ayin, it has alef lamed, lamed, heh, so I\u2019m extremely confused so I wanted to know your thoughts?\n\nIt\u2019s a whole different root, allah doesn\u2019t come from   \u0639 \u0644 \u0648\u200e","upvote_ratio":0.59,"created_utc":1678405153.0},{"title":"Hey, I have a question about Isaiah 14","author":"MuslimSkepticz","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Judaism\/comments\/11n1t49\/hey_i_have_a_question_about_isaiah_14\/","text":"Quick note: I\u2019m not a Jew, I\u2019m a Muslim just learning more about the two other Abrahamic Faiths\n\nWhat does Isaiah 14 talk about?

I didn\u2019t use it either, until I decided to give it a try. \n\nHere goes the story of why: \n\nWhile browsing on Wayback Machine a while ago, I found out there used to be this website in the early 2000s called FrumTeens. Being that I\u2019m a teen right now I obviously didn\u2019t use it back then. It was a forum-type thing where people could vent or ask questions about Jewish topics, etc. It shut down a while ago. I found it was a cool idea, but realized that the reason it doesn\u2019t exist anymore is simply because people stopped using it, as a new thing was made: social media.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing, social media (I\u2019m referring mostly to Instagram and TikTok) isn\u2019t really a supportive, safe place like it was intended to be. For the most part, it\u2019s become full of fakeness, unhealthy standards, bullying and other toxic stuff. Besides that, just in the way it\u2019s built (for the majority of people to be spectators and not \"contributors\"), it\u2019s not really as easy as it seemed to be before, to build connections.\n\nAnd honestly, I feel like sometimes, we could all benefit from a place where we can talk or ask questions in an anonymous and more judgment-free way, a place to kind of escape from real life for a little while. \n\nSo back to the original question of why I'm here: I started thinking about where could a place like that possibly exist, and then I remembered Reddit. Like I said before, I really don't know if there are many teens here, or if anyone shares my opinion, but nonetheless, I decided to try something out. I made a subreddit called r\/FrumTeens. So yeah, if you are a teen 14-18 and you want a place to talk, ask questions, vent, anything, join. \n\nHonestly, even if this doesn't really pick up I'm curious to see where it could go.

The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*\n\nConsider the following three as pure psychological states: gratitude, growth and commitment.\n\n***Gratitude*** can be viewed as a state of being that does not necessarily require a specific person as the recipient of the gratitude, or for anything specific. You can feel grateful for life as a whole and the wholeness of life. Cultivating this mental state is certainly worthwhile.\n\n***Growth*** as a mental state should be distinguished from physical growth. This perspective that envisions the future as better than the present and the past, without *necessarily* negating or rejecting the past. Its aim is to prevent the future from simply repeating the past.\n\nThe feeling of ***belonging*** doesn't necessarily have to be associated with anything specific. Nevertheless, similar to the previously mentioned psychological states of being, it is worth cultivating as a sense of belonging and as an alternative to feeling detached from the people, thoughts, and context of your life. This is preferable to the image of yourself as the lone fighter against the elements, which is romanticized but bleak.  \n\nThese states of being can manifest through limited, concrete actions such as expressing gratitude to someone, feeling remorseful for a mistake, or dedicating oneself to a specific cause. Nothing said here should imply that the purer states of being are foundational or chronologically prior to the actualized expressions of these states. In some cases, the concrete expressions might come first, and self-reflection might lead to awareness of the state of being only afterwards.\n\nIt's important to note that these musings are not meant to imply that these three states are the only states that exist, or that this is the only way to categorize mental experiences.\n\nFor instance, there is a mental state that involves the ***desire*** to ***own*** and ***control***. Although prediction and technology may be valuable and serve as means of fulfilling such a state, there are compelling reasons to avoid cultivating such desires on a psychological level.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678350920.0},{"title":"Sortes biblicae came up snake eyes this morning, and I'm worried.","author":"ShalomRPh","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Judaism\/comments\/11n4rkz\/sortes_biblicae_came_up_snake_eyes_this_morning\/","text":"This is not a joke.\n\nSo I was putting on my tefillin this morning, and I find a piece of someone's tzitzis in my tefillin cover.

Maybe in the yotzros, this is an Ashkenaz shul and they always skip them anyway. Nobody's going to open that page, it'll stay there until the siddur is worn beyond further use, and then it will go to shaimos together with the siddur.

I've been worried about my health, and now this happens. \n\nIt's not like anyone in the shul would have had opportunity to say that, the binding ought to be tight there, there's no reason for the siddur to have fallen open *exactly* where it did without a reason.

The Jewish people too have become acculturated to the point of attending a party celebrating their own defeat. They are hiding amongst the gentiles. Mordechai, in the Midrash, expresses opposition to the party, to this acculturation, without success. The Jewish people are undifferentiated to the point of not even being mentioned in the text, at this point.\nHaman, principally wants to destroy the Jewish people and so, he needs them to be differentiated to the king. Unfortunately, the king doesn't want to acknowledge their existence, preferring a homogeneous empire, and so Haman has to convince the king that an anonymous people is actually destroying his empire. The anonymity here gives the king plausible deniability, but the idea of a distinct nation is still formulated.\nEven the way Haman selects the day to kill the Jews is by a lottery which selects a single option from a homogeneous collective. \n\nMeanwhile, Mordechai sends Esther (Hebrew for hidden) on an undercover mission in the palace. In this way, the king doesn't know her national identity just like he \"doesn't know\" which nation his viceroy is about to destroy. This equates Esther to the Jewish people, who are both hidden among those who wish to destroy them.\nIn the end, the farce breaks, and Esther reveals herself and the Jewish people is revealed as the hidden nation. The Jewish people are finally differentiated both by Haman and by Mordechai. And Haman now loses his cloak of ambiguity and must be punished, and Mordechai is rewarded as a representative of his people. Thus, the very mechanism that curses Haman blesses Mordechai.\n\nOn a deeper level, we are told that Purim is the day when the Jews finally accepted the Torah in full. Just as the plot brought Esther out of hiding, it also brought the Jews out of assimilation and made them self identify, for the first time voluntarily, as a nation. In this way, they chose to accept the Torah of their own accord, and Gd sent both a leader to bring them to this self selection and an antagonist, who both served the same role. It's at the point when Haman builds his gallows when the \"King's Sleep\" is awakened (the King homiletically referring to Gd) and He \"recognizes\" the good of His people.\n\nGood and evil are both creations of Gd and serve the same role towards the same ends. It is evil that drives us to recognize ourselves as distinct by its contrast and it is good that calls us to a separate mission.","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1678226575.0},{"title":"A thought inspired by Wednesday\u2019s Daf (page) in the Talmud, Nazir 44","author":"eliyah23rd","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Judaism\/comments\/11lotps\/a_thought_inspired_by_wednesdays_daf_page_in_the\/","text":"**The art of knowing when to push.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9l8mgj3cngma1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e1db92166c43c0c06c0aeee7a92fa39a3379af2f\n\n*This post presents a philosophical idea inspired by the text of today\u2019s Daf. The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*\n\nGetting involved and taking action is necessary for certain things to happen. Other things will happen at their own pace, and the notion that we are in control is often an illusion. Living a fulfilling life with no regrets often hinges on figuring out whether the challenges we encounter fall into the first category, the second, or somewhere in between.\n\nHere are three examples that cover personal responsibility, navigating large bureaucratic systems, and global issues.  \n\nImagine being in a hospital day after day, taking care of a loved one facing a life-threatening situation. Though the staff are wonderful people, they are overworked and have many patients in need of attention. Sometimes, your loved one requests help in alerting the staff or addressing an issue, while other times it is you who feels something needs attention. Adding to the complexity of the situation, your best friend is a doctor at a different hospital, providing guidance through the steps necessary for your loved one's survival. Throughout the day, you must decide when to approach the staff and when to let them do their job - they are the experts on the ground and care for your loved one, but they have their routines. Pushing too hard may cause more harm than good, and you risk spinning your wheels.  \n\nParenting is an ongoing dilemma that exemplifies this type of situation. Naturally, parents want the best for their children. However, contrary to some opinions, ensuring that your child grows into a well-rounded, happy, and giving individual who maximizes their potential does not solely depend on how much money you spend on their education. On the other hand, some of the most conscientious parents fail to realize that, hopefully, their child will grow up anyway. Every parent faces numerous decisions, ranging from big to small. There are moments when you must put in the effort to ensure that your child remains on the right path, but there are also instances when you need to let go and allow your child's development to take its course.\n\nA third example on a global level is the Communist movement in the first half of the twentieth century. People with good intentions felt angry that some were starving while others idled in pointless luxury, and concluded that everyone must receive the same or according to their needs. The demand to create a fair world with equally divided resources among all its inhabitants is correct in many ways. However, the world economy back then was too small to divide up equally, and everyone would have been impoverished. Today, this calculation may no longer be true, but equal division would remove the incentive for people to participate in driving the economy. They made two mistakes: the timing was not yet right, and they ignored the realities of human psychology. By forcing their simplified image of how people work on their societies, they ended up killing tens of millions of people.\n\nHow can we strike the right balance? How can we know when to push and when to let go? Here are some questions to consider: Are we looking at people and facts objectively or are we imposing our own simplistic understanding on them? Is our ego influencing our decisions and leading us to fantasize about our own capabilities? Are we really supposed to hold back in this situation or are we simply being lazy and missing an opportunity to make a difference?","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678257551.0},{"title":"L'Chaim !

A day when Jews around the world eat cookies, get drunk, wear costumes, and remember the time that Haman - an evil minister at the height of the Persian empire - tried to usurp imperial authority to destroy Jews. A wise Jewish sage Mordechai and his brave cousin Esther got involved in palace intrigue to convince the Persian emperor to prevent Haman from committing a massacre. Esther - a woman - became close to the emperor at great risk to herself, for if Haman had found out that she was Jewish before she could secure her position at court, he would have killed her. But she did, and showed the emperor that Haman, in wanting to kill all the Jews in Persia, would also kill her! Because of a brave woman, a heroine, the emperor permitted Iran's Jews to legally arm themselves and fight back against Haman's thugs.\n\nBefore Haman, and after him, Persia was a good place for minorities. Darius, Cyrus, and most other Persian rulers throughout respected Jews and women. One message we learn from this is that evil people can take control of good places and rule over good people, harming their country and its citizens in the pursuit of evil.\n\nToday, we find ourselves in a strangely similar position to the time of Purim. The country of Iran is being choked by it's theocratic dictators, who deprive the Iranian people of their freedoms and divert money away from Iran towards their obsession of destroying Israel and killing its Jews. The Ayatollah is a modern day Haman, and the women of the protests are all modern Esthers. On this night of Purim, we should remember that through the bravery of women, even dictators can die and would-be oppressors can fall.\n\nMay the Islamic Regime end!

The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*\n\nAn epic struggle plays out in the mind of every human being between the long-term and short-term motivations. The short-term is often triggered by immediate stimuli and demands control over current decisions to satisfy its desires. On the other hand, the long-term takes longer to activate, can be influenced by rational processes, and aims to maximize overall happiness, meaning, or other values for the organism throughout its lifespan.  \n\nThe long-term might even attempt to serve the short-term by suggesting that it agrees with the short-term's objective of, say, obtaining [marshmallows](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment), but that delaying gratification will result in receiving two marshmallows instead of just one in the present moment. The short-term, if it considers the matter at all, believes that only the current self is significant and that the identity between the self now and the self next year is an illusion.  \n\nIn today's consumer society, the key to controlling someone is by offering a stimulus that triggers their short-term behavior. This approach is effective in persuading them to part with their assets and act in the interests of the controlling party. The defense against this tactic is long-term executive control which safeguards the individual's autonomy and freedom.  \n\nThe short-term has a powerful argument on its side. The Ma\u00f1ana Syndrome, characterized by the inclination to procrastinate and delay tasks to an indefinite future, has a logical basis. Given a sufficiently limited time period, represented by ***t***, that starts now, the cost of postponing a challenging project until after ***t*** is over will always be minimal. This reasoning can be repeated continuously once ***t*** has elapsed.  \n\nOne example where the argument of Ma\u00f1ana Syndrome falls short is when a project is already underway. Some projects are challenging, and once significant time and effort have been invested, stopping the project and returning to the previous behavior cancels the time investment and puts the project back at square one. In these cases, reverting to short-term behavior immediately causes long-term damage, which cancels the Ma\u00f1ana Syndrome argument. While it is true that short-term motivations are frequently unresponsive to long-term damage, it weakens their force. Getting started on a difficult project contributes extra drive for pursuing the long-term objective.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678177035.0},{"title":"Question","author":"GreenTreesNGrass789","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Judaism\/comments\/11lcbjd\/question\/","text":"How many Ashkenazi Jews are there and how many Sefardi Jews are there?

The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*\n\nIf you hurt me, next time I\u2019m not going to trust you. Your actions have demonstrated a lack of concern for my well-being and interests, or have shown that you do not value keeping your commitments.\n\nHowever, if your actions were unintentional and you were unaware that your decisions would affect me in the way that they did, due to a lack of critical knowledge or awareness, then it may be appropriate for me to trust you in the future. I assume that you did not cause me harm because you do not care about hurting me or keeping your commitments, but rather because certain information was not available to you, at least not at a conscious level, when you made your decision.\n\nIs it true that we should trust someone in the future if they were not aware of the harm they caused in the past? Why were they not aware of the harm? Was it due to incompetence in finding necessary information, lack of effort in finding out, or simply a lack of concern for the consequences of their actions? If any of these reasons were the cause, then it may be reasonable to assume that the same behavior will continue in the future and that trust should not be given.\n\nWhen evaluating our own behavior or the behavior of others, what is the most crucial aspect to consider? Should we concentrate on the action itself and its outcomes, or on the person's knowledge at the time they acted?\n\nSome may argue that it is unfair to judge someone for not knowing. While that may be true in some cases, it is not always the case that the person could not have known. It could be argued that a person should be held accountable for not putting in sufficient effort to understand the potential consequences of their actions or for not being aware of the impact on others. Firstly, it may be easier to make a conscious effort to gain more knowledge and think more deeply about our actions than to change fundamental personality traits such as empathy and caring. Secondly, the harm caused by not knowing or being aware can be just as significant, if not more so, than the damage caused by malicious intent.\n\nIf the aforementioned argument is valid, the path to becoming a better person and a decision-maker in any given area lies in directing attention towards acquiring knowledge about the subject matter, including its history, genuine requirements, and internal causal structure, and developing awareness of its needs. In essence, the focus should be on knowledge.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678085862.0},{"title":"Death and coping in an interfaith relationship","author":"AdEven546","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Judaism\/comments\/11iym56\/death_and_coping_in_an_interfaith_relationship\/","text":"My fianc\u00e9 died unexpectedly 2 months ago, he was not Jewish.

The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*\n\nConsider the following scenario: You have earned a substantial amount of money, but you now face a considerable tax bill. Your accountant proposes a solution that involves creating a charity that only benefits you, enabling you to avoid paying taxes. The process is legal, but the question remains: is it ethical? Should you proceed with this plan? Additionally, does it matter that the government will have less money to allocate towards both worthwhile and worthless causes that it funds? Ultimately, you have found a way to keep the money for yourself without breaking any laws, but is that enough to justify your actions?\n\nConsider this scenario: Remember the dark days at the start of the Covid-19 epidemic? In an effort to prevent the spread of the disease, the government is enforcing stringent laws. Your brother's wedding is scheduled for this evening, but you are not feeling well this morning. According to the law, if you have come into contact with anyone who has tested positive for Covid-19, you must self-quarantine. You choose not to test yourself and want to attend the wedding. These quarantine laws have been put in place in consultation with the foremost health experts, and you will not be breaking any laws. Is this ethical? Should you go the wedding?\n\nOn one hand, avoiding taxes implies that you are shirking your social responsibilities, and if everyone were to follow the advice of your accountant, the resulting disaster would be inevitable. Simlarly, if you choose to attend the wedding while there is a possibility that you are infected, you may end up spreading the disease to others. This chain of infection could continue and possibly eventually lead to the death of some elderly person.\n\nOn the other hand, these issues are national in scale, and no single person can have a significant impact on them. It is up to society as a whole to decide on the best course of action, which is achieved through legislation and enforcement. While it is your duty to abide by the law, as long as you are not breaking it, there is no need to demand more. The laws represent society's collective judgment on what is right and wrong, and striving to be more righteous than the law demands is both pretentious and futile.\n\nThere are three possibilities: either the first or the second view are correct or both are partially correct and the moral challenge is to decide in which scenarios the first should apply and in which the second.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678024003.0},{"title":"A special thank you","author":"CVanSickening","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Judaism\/comments\/11ia5tj\/a_special_thank_you\/","text":"Hello all,\n\nI just wanted to stop by and thank everybody for rallying around me during a particularly sensitive yet special time in my life.

It enriches those who receive, without making poorer those who give. It takes but a moment, but the memory of it sometimes lasts forever. None is so rich or mighty that he can get along without it, and none is so poor but that he can be made rich by it. A smile creates happiness in the home, fosters good will in business, and is the countersign of friendship. It brings rest to the weary, cheer to the discouraged, sunshine to the sad, and is nature's best antidote for trouble. Yet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it is something that is of no value to anyone until it is given away. Some people are too tired to give you a smile.

The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*\n\nIt is common for us to think that we are entitled to the consequences of our choices, but not to those of pure randomness, chance, or luck. This feeling or attitude applies to both good and bad luck.\n\nSome moral philosophers argue that our good fortune, such as the family we were born into, the country we reside in, our ability to generate income, or how easily we grasp academic concepts, are solely due to chance. The influence of random chance should not lead to some individuals having everything, while the unlucky have nothing. We aspire to construct a society in which our choices and hard work result in a greater portion of the reward, but to create a fair world, we must eliminate luck as a factor.\n\nNaturally, one obstacle is the absence of a clear line between what qualifies as chance and what constitutes genuinely independent decision-making. The events in our lives that we did not select have an impact on the choices we make. A different problem can be illustrated by the fact that many individuals drive recklessly on a daily basis, yet nothing happens to them. If they happen to be unlucky and end up causing a catastrophe due to their carelessness, should they be punished?\n\nConversely, we experience intense frustration when our lives take a turn for the worse despite having done nothing wrong. Consider the scenario of suffering a devastating tragedy, and doctors reveal that the likelihood of such a disease occurring is one in ten million. The question \"why me?\" inevitably arises, and the seething anger that accompanies it exacerbates the challenge of managing the crisis. When others inflict harm upon us, we demand that life be fair and assert that their actions are unjust and unwarranted. At best, we reluctantly accept the reality that life is just not fair.\n\nThroughout history, people have argued that every falling leaf must serve a greater purpose, in part because the notion that our lives are shaped by random misfortune is intolerable to many.\n\nThis outlook on bad luck presents two primary issues. Firstly, the anger we experience in response to misfortune can exacerbate the distress we feel. Secondly, by denying or dissociating ourselves from the outcome, we risk failing to maximize our potential for coping with the misfortune.\n\nPicture yourself sitting at a poker table, having placed a substantial bet with confidence that you hold a strong hand. When the cards are revealed, it becomes apparent that your opponent has the better hand and you lose all of your money. Would it be logical for you to argue that you should not pay up because bad luck is undeserved, and therefore not your fault?\n\nWe are all sitting at this poker table, whether we choose to or not. At times, we may choose to bet higher stakes, but often we find ourselves staking things we care about without having made a  choice to do so, and yet we still end up losing. It is valuable to acknowledge that randomness is built into the game of life. There are many instances when the dice roll in our favor, even if we do not realize it, but there are also times when the roll goes against us. If we choose to embrace sitting at this poker table and strive to accept all the events of the game, it may provide us with the resilience to keep playing.\n\nWhile it is true that randomness and luck play a role in our lives, we shouldn't just passively accept the unfairness of the world. We despise that life can be unfair, and if we have any ability to make it more just, then it's our responsibility to take action.\n\nLife may become less difficult if we can learn to accept the role of bad luck in our lives, but that doesn't mean we should sit back and do nothing to make the world a fairer place.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1677825051.0},{"title":"Is circumcision necessary to consider oneself a Jew?","author":"Magicusmannus","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Judaism\/comments\/11g161r\/is_circumcision_necessary_to_consider_oneself_a\/","text":"I live in the UK, and all of my family on my Mum\u2019s side are Jews.

I was sometimes singled out and picked on growing up decades ago just for being Jewish. I have family in Israel. So okay, I\u2019m not a Jew at all to a Haredi rabbi just because I don\u2019t observe the way they do? Really? I\u2019m very proud of our culture, many aspects of the religion as well and the countless achievements our people have contributed to the world. \n\nBut why are Orthodox Jews, a relatively small portion of the Jewish population overall that\u2019s only about as old as America so often considered to be the authority on who or what is truly Jewish? Why are they so special that they could avoid mandatory military service in Israel, as one example? I know this is a highly controversial thing to say but I find many aspects of Orthodox Judaism to be quite problematic and even contradictory to the ideals shared by most other modern day Jews around the globe. I don\u2019t harbor hate for my own but I don\u2019t feel that many Orthodox Jews have much love or respect for people like me either. An ethnic group so small and historically persecuted should have each other\u2019s backs no matter what, no? \n\nAs someone who admittedly hasn\u2019t delved deep into the topic, can someone explain why Orthodox Jews are held to such a high regard when it comes to determining what and who is Jewish in Israel and beyond? \n\nSorry if I offend anyone here it is not my intention, this has just been on my mind for a long time and I thought this would be a good place to get some answers. Thank you and shalom.\n\nEdit: math \/ Judaism is closer to 3,000 years old\n\nEdit 2: I stand corrected. So I now understand that before the label of Orthodox became a thing, basically all practicing Jews were what we know today as Orthodox and it wasn\u2019t until other forms of Judaism splintered off (like reform, conservative etc) that the label of Orthodox was established.

The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*\n\nWe live our lives in the company of others, and how they see us has a profound effect on our sense of self. We create our selves in the gaze of the other. The way we view ourselves is often influenced by how we think others perceive us. Part of our brain continually processes questions about how our behavior might be perceived by the people we know or the wider community, even in their absence.\n\nOn the one hand, that gaze of the other can be oppressive, limiting our freedom to act on our impulses freely. This gaze restricts us to the narrative we have constructed, compelling us to \"stay in character.\" It also induces anxiety about living up to the judgments they might make about us.\n\nOn the other hand, the pressure to conform to the expectations of others can be beneficial, as it motivates us to perform our societal roles to the best of our ability. Being aware that we are constantly being evaluated by others compels us to take the utmost responsibility when making decisions, ultimately leading to personal growth. For those who hold significant power or play critical roles in society, the scrutiny of the public eye is especially important. It serves as a reminder of the weight of their responsibility and encourages them to excel in their roles.\n\nJean-Paul Sartre, the distinguished existentialist philosopher, wrote a play titled \"No Exit\" in which three strangers are locked in a room for eternity. According to the play, this punishment is worse than any physical torture because it compels the three individuals to live under constant scrutiny and judgment from one another. An intriguing alternative to this scenario would be if everyone, regardless of their actions in life, were subject to the same fate in the afterlife - existing forever in the gaze everyone they had ever helped or harmed, getting to experience firsthand the feelings that others hold for them, for all of eternity.\n\nPutting aside fiction, there is a way to mitigate the anxiety and inhibitions that come with being constantly observed by others. Wine, that has been enjoyed since ancient times, has the ability to make us ignore the judgments of others and the pressure to conform to societal expectations. However, this freedom comes at a cost, as alcohol impairs our judgment and may lead to irresponsible behavior. It is unclear whether alcohol's ability to cause disinhibition is linked to its impact on our logical reasoning or if these are two separate neural effects, but this is not necessarily relevant.\n\nWhen we are in a position of significant responsibility, such as a judge presiding over a court case, a police officer on duty, or even just driving a car, it can be tempting to try to distance ourselves from the role and its accompanying responsibilities. However, the consequences of becoming intoxicated while carrying out such duties can be catastrophic. Conversely, there are times when we are free from such responsibilities and crave release from the pressure of being constantly observed and judged by others. In such moments, a moderate amount of wine can help ease us into the mental state we desire.\n\nThere will always be a dynamic interaction between the freedom to choose whatever role we want for the moment and the pressure others impose on us to stick to the roles and responsibilities we have chosen in the past. Recognizing and understanding these tensions can help us in navigating them and living the life we truly desire.","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1677776785.0},{"title":"Commandments subject to \"Karet\"","author":"BaltimoreBadger23","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Judaism\/comments\/11g397x\/commandments_subject_to_karet\/","text":"A different post about Circumcision got me thinking about the Torah penalty of Karet and I have a hypothesis I'd like to test.

I was told (if memory serves) that the Jewish understanding of \"omniscient\" is \"all that CAN BE known\" versus a blanket \"all-knowing\" trait. This speaks to the concept of multiverses and timelines and alt-realities coexisting simultaneously. God immediately sees the story to our next crossroad as soon we take the left, take the right, stop the car, get out, speed through the light, let the little old lady cross first... you get the idea. I'm not sure how minute the decision needs to be to create the next collection of rabbit holes, but perhaps it's infinitesimal.\n\nGod probably can even guess what our Alpha selves will do as that timeline continues while He also sees the spin-offs in every direction of what happens to all the possible outcomes spurred on by what we didn't do.\n\nHowever, this is all contingent on the meaning of \"omniscient\" and the existence of things other than this one reality.

The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*\n\nWe have a tendency to draw conclusions and make inferences based on singular examples or atypical cases. When we observe unusual behavior, we often establish a general rule or statement that applies to that person or we make sweeping generalizations about entire groups of people or even humanity as a whole based on individual behavior.\n\nA notable instance of an author who built an extensive theoretical framework by studying pathological individuals is Freud. This does not necessarily invalidate his theories; in fact, today there is substantial evidence that many of the processes in our brains is hidden from us. However, the fundamental proposition that one can draw upon individuals with severe functional impairments who fall outside the range of average behavior to make conjectures about a theory meant to apply to everyone but in a more moderate manner is implausible.\n\nThe exception to this tendency is, if there is one, found in the hard sciences. For instance, there are two famous astronomical observations that strongly bolstered theories that were not yet universally accepted.\n\nWhat sets the hard sciences apart in this regard is not solely their reliance on meticulous observations. Numerous areas of human knowledge share this characteristic, and many of our convictions are based on some perceived \"facts.\" What distinguishes the hard sciences, particularly in cases where their efficacy is evident, is their dependence on highly precise definitions and exceedingly repeatable observations. Even when certain terms, such as electron orbits, electromagnetic waves, or energy, might appear somewhat ambiguous, the imprecision lies solely in the way the terms are conveyed to the layperson. Each of these concepts has an exact definition as they are employed in scientific calculations.\n\nThis does not apply to almost any other form of human communication. Every word we use has a changeable meaning that is highly dependent on the context in which it is used. Even when we try to be meticulous in our reasoning, we are frequently unaware of the extent to which we have subtly modified a word's meaning as we move from premise to conclusion.\n\nThis does not imply that we should be skeptical of everything. Rather, it implies that we should aim to rely solely on very short chains of reasoning that progress from premises we cannot doubt and extend just one or two logical steps away. Nearly all overarching theories depend on numerous steps of logic, and thus, they will require examples to be forced into unsuitable molds and counterexamples to be disregarded.\n\nGeneral observations are often helpful, but we must recognize that they only apply to specific situations. It may be useful to use different general rules in other areas, even if these general rules do not fit well together. Skeptical pluralism is usually the most effective approach in many cases.\n\nIt's possible that applying more skepticism to our own beliefs wouldn't do much harm, and it might even help us coexist more peacefully.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677685078.0},{"title":"I read this month - Book Discussion!","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Judaism\/comments\/11f36xp\/i_read_this_month_book_discussion\/","text":"What did you read this past month?

In a pamphlet published by Greenwald, Kastner was said to have worked with the Nazis, withheld from Hungarian Jews information that might have saved their lives, benefited from Nazi generosity, and given testimony that helped at least one Nazi escape more severe punishments after the war had ended. \n\nThe Israeli government charged Greenwald because of these accusations, and the hearings went on for nearly a year with attorney Shmuel Tamir at the helm of Greenwald's defense. In a stunning upset, Kastner was proven guilty by the Supreme Court of Israel in mid-1955, and he was assassinated less than two years later by a former Lehi member. Greenwald died in 1958.\n\nBen Hecht, the author of \"Perfidy\", was a journalist, screenwriter, and late-in-the-game Zionist. His telling of the Kastner Trial is a series of scenes, not chapters, and these scenes are written as though the reader is in the room with the characters, watching the story unfold before the reader's own eyes. Hecht's bombastic writing style lends itself to poetic license and fantasy. It reads almost like a Tarantino script. \n\nTo say this book moved me is an understatement. I repeatedly found myself reading twenty pages in one sitting, then putting the book away for a while because its details evoked such visceral feelings within me. At more than one point, I felt sick to my stomach while reading. What went on in the book's locales - Hungary, Turkey, Egypt, and elsewhere - was truly gruesome and horrifying.\n\nDo I think every detail was accurate? No. Hecht had a definite agenda, and I'm not certain his motives were pure. Because of reading \"Perfidy\", though, I did learn a few new things about the Holocaust and early Israeli history. I'm a bit more skeptical of early Zionist leaders than I once was, and I wonder what might have been if Hungary's Jews had been given some sort of warning - by Rudolf Kastner or someone else. \n\nAt the same time, though, I don't always succeed at negatively judging Nazi collaborators. After a catastrophe occurs, most of us like to say we'd have been heroes; but the truth is that it's likely we'd have gone along with the bad guys if it meant we had a chance to save ourselves or our loved ones. Men and women like Mordechai Anielewicz and Chanah Senesh were heroes precisely because of their rarity. \n\nIf you can take Hecht's writing for what it is - and keep a small bucket of salt handy - you should read \"Perfidy\". It will haunt, educate, startle, and move you.","upvote_ratio":0.56,"created_utc":1677682697.0},{"title":"The number 127","author":"Upbeat_Teach6117","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Judaism\/comments\/11eqenh\/the_number_127\/","text":"In the Megilah, Achashverosh rules over 127 provinces.\n\nIn Bereishit, Sarah dies at the age of 127.\n\nIs there some connection between the two details?\n\nAlso, are there other instances of the number 127 in Jewish texts?","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1677634311.0},{"title":"I got sick of people not understanding how eruvin aren't a loophole so I made a copypasta in the form of the instructions of the holy hand grenade of antioch.

Like, life of course is not constant, but sometimes we also should put that inconstancy actively in our lifes.\n\nWe were talking about this because I told her that, although I always try to be thankful with Hashem, and put our couple's plans on his hands, recently I feel like if I lost a part of my faith. I simply don't enjoy studying Torah as I did. I don't even feel obligated or like if I should do it. I have even forgot a lot of hebrew, and I don't feel motivated.\n\nSo she said that maybe I've been 'running' a lot with my faith, and I should let it rest. At first I was thinking that it is contradictory to judaism. I mean, we are mean to believe in G-d constantly, right? A lot of things, in my opinion, say that implicitly.\n\nBut then, maybe she could be right and I should take a break and try not to force my faith. Maybe you guys know of an example or something in the Torah that could actually be an example of this: Putting emunah apart for some time.\n\nThe thing is that I also feel like maybe this is just yetzer hara. That I should embrace my faith and stay strong.

In the realm of race, the families of Ashkenazi Jews haven't lived in the Middle East for thousands of years. Ashkenazi Jews indeed have Middle Eastern Blood; however, not more than Italians or most Eastern Europeans. The majority of other Reform American Jews I know and I would not be considered (MENA) if passed by on the street. I am very well aware that we, as Jews, faced immense antisemitism in Europe.

The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*\n\nThe way you respond to an event depends on how you describe it. For instance, if you're in a disagreement with someone, calling it \"an attack\" or \"a threat\" can trigger defensive and hostile feelings and may even intensify the conflict or cause you to shut down. In contrast, if you label it as \"a difference of opinion\" or \"an opportunity to understand,\" you're likely to feel more receptive and inquisitive, which can lead to better listening and seeking common ground. Your choice of words also influences how you approach upcoming challenges. Using words like \"scary\" or \"risky\" can make you more cautious, whereas \"a challenge\" can spur you on. Additionally, the same situation can be perceived differently depending on how you describe it. Describing someone as \"taking back their earlier statements\" is vastly different from portraying it as \"explaining what they meant when they said something earlier.\"\n\nWe tend to believe that our opinions and reactions are grounded in the objective facts of a given situation. Nevertheless, the \"facts\" themselves are seldom completely neutral. How they are described, either by yourself or by someone else, plays a crucial role in shaping your memory of the event. Even just moments later, the details you draw upon to shape your response are likely to be the words of the description rather than the raw sensory information. In other words, the way information is conveyed and framed is an essential element of how we perceive and remember events.\n\nNeurologically speaking, the reason we tend to react to the words used to describe an event rather than the raw sensory input is due to the way our brains store and retrieve information. Our brains create specific responses based on particular words and phrases. These responses are triggered when we hear or think those words, and they can then generate additional words and reactions. A cascade of reactions, often occurring simultaneously, will ultimately reach our attention and determine a physical response, emotion, action, or verbal statement. This word-based reaction system is far more efficient because a single word can encompass a vast range of images and sounds, making it easier for our brains to retrieve and process information.\n\nThis mechanism can also shed light on other people's behavior. Consider how individuals describe the facts they are responding to in their own minds when they behave a certain way. Often, they will have formed a mental and unspoken description of the situation that explains why they reacted in a particular manner. While this insight can help you comprehend other people's actions, it does not necessarily mean their responses are reasonable. Although they may have their own unique perspective on what just happened, that perspective might be idiosyncratic and unrelatable. At times, a person's description of an event might be so far removed from anyone else's that it is simply invalid. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that some of the most creative individuals are those who view things from a completely different perspective than anyone else.\n\nNo matter what you are doing, if you have the time, it can be helpful to try and consider more than one description of what just happened. This approach can assist you in gaining a deeper understanding of the situation and may result in a more effective response.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677589807.0},{"title":"We found out my stepfather died last night in an accident.

I hope this question isn't too out there.\n\nA couple of things about me. My grandmother was Jewish on my father's side, but he was raised by his grandparents, who raised him as a Christian. I never met my grandmother.\n\nI was raised as a Christian as well but I quickly fell out of that as a teenager. I'm not quite sure that I think I'll ever follow a religion again, but I have always felt like I wanted to learn more about Judaism.\n\nIs there any room in the Jewish community for someone who feels a connection to the ethnicity but not so much a connection to Judaism the religion? However with an academic interest in Judaism? I know that is strange.\n\nI once mentioned that my grandmother was Jewish in elementary school and that fact followed me around the rest of my time in school. Whenever someone wanted to insult me they'd call me a Jew. I always had a strong interest in history, including WWII, and because I would read books about that time period I remember one kid seeing a Nazi on the cover of one of them- he used to bully me by calling me the \"Jewish Nazi.\" Which was quite conflicting.\n\nThe insults came from other white kids. I am very pale and people would make fun of me for it and attribute it to my Jewishness.\n\nI know its just childhood bullying and it doesn't amount to much. But it hurt a lot growing up and because of that experience I have always felt ostracized by other people I grew up with. While I identify as a white person I guess, I've always felt a little bit like I didn't belong (it was white kids who would bully me about it.)\n\nSince I've been an adult I've straight up just hidden the fact my grandmother was Jewish but recently I've felt ashamed of that, as if I'm insulting her memory.\n\nAnyways. I know it doesn't make a lot of sense. I have always felt like I've floated between different wolds.\n\nTo white people who know I had a Jewish grandmother I'm just a pale Jew. To POC I'm just a white guy. To be fair, though, POC have never bullied me in the same manner as white people.\n\nAnyways. I know it's silly. I guess I'm just beginning to think about this stuff and was wondering if anyone else has ever dealt with something like this, and I'm also curious about what my heritage implies about my own ethnicity.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1677544060.0},{"title":"Tachanun on Zayin Adar | Sefaria","author":"EngineerDave22","url":"https:\/\/www.sefaria.org.il\/sheets\/382399?lang=he","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677559590.0},{"title":"How much to drink on Purim according to the Rambam","author":"YoelFievelBenAvram","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Judaism\/comments\/11ddl1b\/how_much_to_drink_on_purim_according_to_the_rambam\/","text":"It is a miswah to have a lavish feast where one eats meat and drinks wine to the point of intoxication and falls asleep in a stupor on Purim.

But what does the Rambam mean according to the Rambam? It is very unusual for the Rambam to use terms he does not define. What is \"\u05e2\u05b7\u05d3 \u05e9\u05c1\u05b6\u05d9\u05bc\u05b4\u05e9\u05c1\u05b0\u05ea\u05bc\u05b7\u05db\u05bc\u05b7\u05e8\", until he gets drunk mean?\n\nElsewhere in the Mishneh Torah, the Rambam gives some advice, not to get drunk in the house of a mourner. Hil. Avel 13:8 states\n\n> \u05d0\u05b5\u05d9\u05df \u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9\u05df \u05d1\u05bc\u05b0\u05d1\u05b5\u05d9\u05ea \u05d4\u05b8\u05d0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b5\u05dc \u05d9\u05b8\u05ea\u05b5\u05e8 \u05e2\u05b7\u05dc \u05e2\u05b2\u05e9\u05c2\u05b8\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4 \u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e1\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea \u05dc\u05b0\u05db\u05b8\u05dc \u05d0\u05b6\u05d7\u05b8\u05d3 \u05d5\u05b0\u05d0\u05b6\u05d7\u05b8\u05d3--\u05e9\u05c1\u05b0\u05dc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e9\u05c1\u05b8\u05d4 \u05e7\u05b9\u05d3\u05b6\u05dd \u05d0\u05b2\u05db\u05b4\u05d9\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4, \u05d5\u05bc\u05e9\u05c1\u05b0\u05dc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e9\u05c1\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d1\u05bc\u05b0\u05ea\u05d5\u05b9\u05da\u05b0 \u05d0\u05b2\u05db\u05b4\u05d9\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4, \u05d5\u05b0\u05d0\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05bc\u05b8\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d0\u05b7\u05d7\u05b7\u05e8 \u05d0\u05b2\u05db\u05b4\u05d9\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4; \u05d5\u05b0\u05dc\u05b9\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05e1\u05b4\u05d9\u05e3, \u05e9\u05c1\u05b6\u05de\u05bc\u05b6\u05d0 \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05c1\u05b0\u05ea\u05bc\u05b7\u05db\u05bc\u05b7\u05e8.\n\nWhich Chabad translates as\n\n> No one person should drink more than ten cups of wine in the house of a mourner: three before the meal, three during the meal, and four afterwards. One should not drink more lest he become intoxicated.\n\nA cup of wine is a cup containing at least a Rivi'it of wine which is about 2.5 ounces or 75 milliliters. This amounts to one full standard bottle of wine, which is consistent with avoiding intoxication if drank with food over the course of time. If this does not accurately describe the capacity of your liver, adjust accordingly. Therefore, one should drink slightly more to ensure intoxication, and when one begins to feel the wine excessively, one should go lay down and go to sleep. In this way, they ensure intoxication without risking harm, physical or spiritual. One is still forbidden to become as drunk as Lot, i.e., where one cannot remember what they have done. And keep in mind, the Miswah is to enjoy wine to the point one falls asleep. This is in stark contrast to the goal of the drunk which is to fight the urge to fall asleep in order to drink more and increase their intoxication. If one finds themselves fighting to stay awake, they find themselves fighting the fulfillment of a Miswah, and one should not delay a Miswah. Stay safe. Needless to say, if someone is harmed by any amount of wine due to illness either physical or mental, drinking remains forbidden to them.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1677509255.0},{"title":"Is there a book of Jewish songs for all occasions that includes English translations?","author":"ribbonsofeuphoria","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Judaism\/comments\/11dg52h\/is_there_a_book_of_jewish_songs_for_all_occasions\/","text":"Think NCSY bencher but for every holiday.

The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*\n\nIn our society, it appears that almost everything has a monetary value. If you want a better car, clothing, or home, you must pay more to obtain it, which seems reasonable. However, there are certain things that we have assigned a price to, but perhaps they should be exempt. For example, if someone pays more money, they can skip the line when boarding a plane, leaving others waiting. Are we valuing equality and our shared humanity based on one's ability to pay? Furthermore, with more money, one can afford a better lawyer, resulting in a higher chance of achieving justice. But should justice have a price tag? Additionally, the wealthiest individuals can access the best doctors in the world, potentially saving their lives. But is the right to life something that should be available only to those who can afford it?\n\nSimilarly, the opposite appears to hold true. If one is compensated for their services, it is expected that they deliver their best effort. However, what if an individual volunteers their services without receiving any compensation? Some may argue that there is no obligation to provide a service without pay, and that the recipient should merely express gratitude for whatever is given. However, is it reasonable to tie giving to a monetary value? Perhaps acts of generosity should not be measured by a price tag.\n\nOur society has been built on the premise that individual freedom necessitates the ability to make diverse decisions regarding what one deems valuable. By choosing to pay more for items or experiences that hold significance, individuals can demonstrate their personal priorities. Money serves as the grease that facilitates this freedom of choice. However, the disadvantage of this system is that everything appears to come with a price tag, including those values that may be immeasurable.\n\nIt is possible that we have gone too far with this system. It appears as though we have come to the belief that if an activity is not compensated, it lacks value. This line of thinking, taken to its extreme, insinuates that an individual who is not receiving payment for their services has no inherent worth as a human being.\n\nWe could be on the verge of a new economic era. The rapid progress of technology has the potential to cause substantial disruption, with computers becoming capable of replacing a multitude of jobs. As a result, individuals may need a significant amount of time to acquire new skills and become productive in different areas, and some may be unable to do so. It may become necessary to provide essential services to everyone, regardless of productivity. We also want to avoid detrimental consequences for individuals' self-esteem. Furthermore, we may need to explore expanding the role of volunteering in our economy.\n\nEmploying money as a means of prioritizing services could be beneficial, but we may need to moderate this approach. The notion that something must have a price to be valuable and that it only holds worth if it is priced can become hazardous if taken to an extreme. Voluntary services should also be valued and come with their own set of responsibilities. Ultimately, an individual's worth is not determined by financial compensation, and money should, at most, serve as a tool to achieve our goals as a society.","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1677512501.0},{"title":"I made my own mezzuzah","author":"StormingDaCastle","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Judaism\/comments\/11cyrut\/i_made_my_own_mezzuzah\/","text":"I designed, 3D printed, and painted a mezzuzah following my grandmother's passing.

I was raised reconstructionist but  gravitated more towards orthodox spaces in high school and have been an active member of the Chabad on my campus during my four years at college. \n\nI started transitioning a few years ago and I pass as male to new people I meet most of the time. I will probably continue to look more and more masculine as time passes and I intend to live my life in all meaningful ways as male. I haven't had a conversation about my transition with the rabbi at the Chabad near me, though I am sure he would be kind and supportive. He sees and treats me as female. \n\nThough I imagine I will eventually find a conservative synagogue to join, I am sure that after I graduate this year, I will find a Chabad wherever I move to and will connect with that community first. I have loved my time with Chabad and it is a big part of why I have found Jewish community in my life. \n\nMy question is about the ethics of presenting myself as male in spaces where that decision will impact the behaviors of others, particularly in spaces like Chabad ones where they may assume I am biologically male and will treat me as such.

The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*\n\nWhen we say something like \"children deserve special consideration,\" what exactly are we referring to when we use the term \"children\"? Is it simply a reference to a particular group of human beings who happen to have been born less than a certain number of years ago, or is it an indication of some special ontological reality of the world that we call \"childhood\"? Could we replace the word \"children\" with a list of individuals such as \"this one, that one, and that one too\" to achieve the same meaning? While the word \"children\" might be used as a shorthand for the two billion individuals who meet the age criteria, it is more than just a simple list. It refers to a broader category of individuals who share common characteristics, experiences, and needs.\n\nAt first glance, the question of what we mean when we use terms such as \"children\" may appear obscure. However, the answer we arrive at can have a significant impact on how we view the world and our belief systems. Understanding the nature of the terms we use and the concepts they represent is essential for developing a coherent and consistent worldview. For instance, if we believe that the term \"child\" refers to a special reality that exists independently of individual instances, we may hold certain beliefs about the nature of childhood and the needs of children. On the other hand, if we see the term as a mere label that we apply to a group of similar individuals, our beliefs about children and childhood may be different. In this sense, the question of what we mean by terms such as \"children\" is not just an academic exercise but has real-world implications.\n\nPhilosophers draw a distinction between Universals and Particulars. Universals refer to concepts or properties that can be instantiated by multiple individual instances, whereas particulars refer to individual, concrete instances of those concepts or properties. For example, the word \"chair\" refers to a universal - a concept that is defined by a particular shape and use. Individual chairs are particulars, which share the common characteristic of being instances of the universal \"chair.\" Similarly, other examples of universals include redness, triangle, and apple. These concepts can be instantiated by multiple particular instances - for example, the redness of a rose, the triangle shape of a road sign, or the apple on a table.\n\nAnother distinction is between Nominalism and Realism. Nominalism is the position that universals, such as redness or chairness, are not real things that exist independently of individual objects. Instead, according to nominalists, universals are simply names or labels that we give to groups of similar objects or experiences. In other words, universals are mental constructs that do not exist outside of our minds.\n\nRealism, on the other hand, is the position that universals are real things that exist independently of individual objects. According to realists, universals have an objective reality that is not dependent on human thought or language. Realists often argue that universals are instantiated in individual objects or experiences, but they exist independently of those individual instances. (Please don't confuse this meaning of Realism with other uses in Philosophy.)\n\nTo give an example, suppose we have two apples, both of which are red. According to a nominalist, the concept of \"redness\" is simply a label or name that we apply to these two objects because they share certain similarities in color. However, according to a realist, the quality of \"redness\" is a real and objective feature that exists independently of our labeling or perception of it.\n\nWhat about the word 'children'? Nominalists might view this word as a mere abbreviation for a list of individual children, while realists would see it as representing a distinct and meaningful category. According to realism, the universal concept of 'child' is a real entity, and so is the class of children as a group. In contrast, nominalists would argue that the term 'child' is simply a label we use to refer to a collection of similar individuals, without any underlying reality beyond our mental construct.\n\nWhat about the word 'family'? What meaning do 'my family' or 'my people' have to me? Now, this distinction may make a real difference. I might believe that the closer someone is to me, the more obligations I have to them and the more I should prioritize their needs over others. Conversely, the further removed someone is, the less obligation I have, but I still have some responsibility for everybody. On the other hand, I might think that such words do not simply identify a list of people, but rather an abstract entity with its own meaning for me. This might entail rules that I apply to my group that I do not apply to other groups, and I might feel no obligation to such other groups.\n\nThe way we view the world and structure our concepts influences the beliefs we hold about how we should behave.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677389675.0},{"title":"What is the opening prayer to Shacharit that repeats the word \u201cBeit Hamikdash\u201d?","author":"UrbanWanderer","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Judaism\/comments\/11by3v7\/what_is_the_opening_prayer_to_shacharit_that\/","text":"Hi!\n\nI grew up conservative in the US, but always had a knack for Hebrew.

The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*\n\nThere are two possible reactions to unfortunate events in our lives: we can take the attitude that it's all our fault, thinking that if only we hadn't done X, this terrible event would never have happened, or it would never have affected us.\n\nOn the other hand, we could take the opposite attitude: that there is nothing we could have done to prevent it. This terrible tragedy would have happened anyway, or it was fated to happen no matter what choices we had made.\n\nThe second attitude is more comforting because it disconnects the tragedy from our own decisions and removes any responsibility from ourselves or our past decisions. Even if we did not cause this disaster but had simply put ourselves in harm's way, the idea that it could never have been otherwise protects us from the pain of looking back and regretting our actions. It saves us from having to go through the painful process of wishing we had done otherwise.\n\nNevertheless, for all the comfort that this deterministic or fatalist perspective might give us, this attitude causes much damage. While it helps us deal with the past, the price we pay is that we lose our sense of agency. Agency is the belief that we are active players in the life we live, that our decisions matter. Even if we cannot predict the outcome of our decisions and even if we will never know enough to guarantee that we are making the right decisions, agency is the belief that we make those decisions and that choosing one way might bring vastly different outcomes than choosing the opposite.\n\nSo how does the person who believes in their own agency cope with such tragedies? There are no ready answers, but here are a few suggestions. One piece of advice is to realize that there is nothing you can do about the facts of the past. Train yourself to spend no time or anxiety on thinking about the things you have no power to change, and there is no better example of that than the events of the past.\n\nPerhaps the unfortunate events were really your fault after all. Maybe you had some serious character flaw that made you act the way you did. In that case, you can work hard to change who you are and be a better person in the future.\n\nIt is incoherent to believe both that (a) it was your fault that you behaved the way you did in the past and at the same time (b) you cannot change who you are. If you cannot change who you are, then it is not your fault who you are. A better conclusion is that if you believe that you are to blame for who you were, it follows that you should believe that you can change. Far better to start the process of changing, leave your former errors behind and stop dwelling on the past. Even if you were to blame, that was you back then. Believe in your present and future self.\n\nIf our lives are going the wrong way, losing the sense of agency, the feeling that it is we who control our decisions, is the wrong way to go. Belief that you control your future is still your best chance of making it a good one. By taking responsibility for our past mistakes, learning from them, and focusing on personal growth and improvement, we can shape our future in a positive direction.

Meditation is a good exercise but being with Hashem during the day can be done throughout the day. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that sometimes we must dive into an activity.

All schools of thought and streams of Judaism are invited to discuss!\n\nLong story short, I\u2019m a descendant of a Jewish grandfather on my mothers side. My father married a Jewish woman, whose family I was lucky enough to be welcomed into. They celebrated the major Jewish holidays to bring family together, etc. \n\nAt around 18 I started researching Judaism and my own ancestry and at 25 decided to join the greatest nation\/culture\/people ever known to exist! After many hurdles in life I accomplished my goal along with 3 of my children. Mazel tov \ud83c\udf89 right? 2 of my children I have full custody of as their mother had her parental rights stripped, the other, my youngest daughter\u2019s mother and I agreed to raise her as a Jew. All this was explained to the Bet Din, no questions asked. \n\nA while after the mikveh I asked for our certificates to be sent to my home. I was asked for the address I wanted them sent to and told they would be on the way and also registered on file in Cleveland,but they were never sent. It was all during covid and I didn\u2019t want to be a bother, so I wait to ask again..\n\nAbout eight months later I ask again, this time mentioning that I need them for legal proceedings in family court as a measure to ensure that I am able to continue to raise my daughter the way she has been so far. \n\nI received all the certificates\u2026\nMy youngest daughter\u2019s was written with a sharpie over it saying \u201cDID NOT HAVE MOTHERS PERMISSION\u201d the names of the Bet Din crossed out. Also, nothing was ever registered like I was told, I checked. \n\nThis is traumatizing and now has so many potential affects in our lives. \n\nI did have the mothers permission, but they never asked for proof at the time, never asked any questions the first time I asked for the certificates that weren\u2019t sent. \n\nOnly now, since I was so naive as to tell the Rabbi why this was so important now, did the subject come up, nor did he ask to speak to the mother or ask for said \u201cproof\u201d. \n\nHer mother and I can\u2019t even communicate with eachother via  court order, and she is so bitter that I doubt she would tell the truth if asked\u2026.\n\n* edit*\nI forgot to mention that the Rabbi said I should look for another synagogue as we are not a good fit\u2026not due to any other issue.

I expected that reaction probably because I grew up in a very repressive home and went to very repressive schools. I had been convinced by my parents and teachers that having questions of faith was somehow my fault, and that questions of faith were not worth pursuing.

The comments on my post were (mostly) supportive and helpful, and nobody shamed me or rejected me for my questions. People mostly sympathized, and suggested that I check out Reconstructionist Judaism. There was little in the way of judgement, and mostly just people telling me to find what works out for me, and that they were impressed that I was looking for truth.\n\nI talked to a modern orthodox Rabbi about my questions today, also afraid he would denigrate me or even throw me out of his office. He too, did not act like I was trained to believe that he would, and instead encouraged my questions, and saw them as totally valid.

This is precisely the situation that, in the Jewish tradition (and, actually, in every genuine messianic tradition), comes to pass when the Messiah arrives. The first consequence of this arrival is that the Law (according to the Kabbalists, this is the law of the Torah of Beriah, that is, the law in force from the creation of man until the messianic days) is fulfilled and consummated. But this fulfillment does not signify that the old law is simply replaced by a new law that is homologous to the old but has different prescriptions and dif- ferent prohibitions (the Torah of Aziluth, the originary law that the Messiah, according to the Kabbalists, would restore, contains neither prescriptions nor prohibitions and is only a jumble of unordered letters). What is implied instead is that the fulfillment of the Torah now coincides with its transgression. This much is clearly affirmed by the most radical messianic movements, like that of Sabbatai Zevi (whose motto was \u201cthe fulfillment of the Torah is its transgression\u201d).\u201d","upvote_ratio":0.74,"created_utc":1677162061.0},{"title":"Grew up yeshivish going OTD -- Convince me to stay frum!","author":"sudo_samba_addusr","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Judaism\/comments\/11965ul\/grew_up_yeshivish_going_otd_convince_me_to_stay\/","text":"Hey all,\n\nI grew up super yeshivish and had a lot of questions regarding Jewish faith.

The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*\n\nThere are two distinct meanings for the word \"certainty\". One meaning refers to a feeling or emotion and describes a mental state, while the other refers to the outcome of a logical procedure that can be implemented on a piece of paper or a computer. However, we are also familiar with attempting to execute the procedure in our minds.\n\nWe often conflate these two meanings of \"certainty\". We may mistakenly assume that experiencing a sense of certainty indicates the presence of rational, objective proof for our beliefs. Conversely, we may delude ourselves into thinking that acknowledging the absence of proof for a particular stance implies a lack of emotional certainty.\n\nGamblers, particularly compulsive ones, often wager their money based on an unwavering belief that there is no risk involved. Although they may use language that acknowledges the existence of alternative possibilities, they still experience an emotional sense of complete certainty.\n\nIt is fair to say that almost all of us engage in some form of gambling. We are all required to make decisions for which there is no guarantee of a certain outcome. We often hold beliefs that conflict with opposing views, with no logical proof to resolve the dispute. Nevertheless, we experience a strong sense of certainty regarding our position and often base our decisions on this emotional conviction.\n\nThe ability to separate our emotional and rational faculties in this manner is a valuable asset. Without this capability, we would be incapacitated by our inability to act, as we would be unable to overcome the rational uncertainty that often arises in our decision-making, and we could never decide which option to take or which belief to hold. However, sometimes we need the emotional sense of certainty to override our rational side, which can enable us to make a decision and act upon it.\n\nIt could even be argued that societies with a relatively egalitarian structure have a greater need for an oracular source of certainty. Without such a source, the endless debate and conflicting views could prevent the society from reaching a resolution. It may not be significant whether the Oracle has any greater access to the truth than we do, as long as the society can reach a collective agreement and move forward.\n\nWe should be aware of our tendency to rely on emotional certainty like gamblers, but we must continue to do so.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1677144868.0},{"title":"Strange hamantaschen for strange times","author":"i_collect_seashells","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Judaism\/comments\/119imyr\/strange_hamantaschen_for_strange_times\/","text":"What would be some non-traditional hamantaschen dough-filling combinations? \n\nDo hamantaschen have to be sweet?

The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*\n\nIn this post, I will argue that receiving something for free creates a sense of obligation to use it in accordance with the giver's intentions.\n\nThe reason someone gives you something for free is because their values motivate them to do so. The most common example of this kind of giving is parents providing for their children. Although parents may be solely motivated by their desire to benefit their child, rather than any expectation of reciprocity, children often still feel a sense of obligation attached to this act of giving.\n\nIn the case of the parent-child relationship, this obligation often involves certain expectations, such as passing on the same generosity to your own children, and living your life in accordance with the values instilled by your parents - at least to some extent.\n\nThis sense of obligation can often cause tension within the human psyche, as it conflicts with the desire for autonomy, freedom, and the right to choose one's own path in life. Children don't choose their parents or the circumstances of their birth, so any sense of obligation can be especially challenging. To emphasize this point, even if you feel that your parents would never have sought to limit your choices in any way, imagine if you chose a way of living that went against everything your parents held dear or if your behavior was the type they struggled their whole lives to prevent. At its core, this dilemma raises a fundamental ethical issue: is it right to accept a gift, only to use it against the giver?\n\nHere is a proposal that might ease this inevitable tension. Firstly, the previous generations did not have access to the facts that have determined your life, your challenges, struggles and decisions, and secondly, the world they lived in was different; the world is changing, and doing so ever faster. Therefore, you may not feel obligated to make the same decisions that they did. However, there is great value in asking yourself: if they had lived today and knew everything you know about your own life and context, what beliefs would they then hold?

The Daf is one page in the Talmud that tens of thousands of people study each day. I explain the connection to the text in a comment below. My purpose is to show that there are underlying philosophical assumptions in the Talmud that can have great significance for anybody today trying to understand our complex reality.*\n\nWhile individualism is a valuable trait, it may be worth considering toning down the emphasis on individualism when making decisions about your child's education. This is particularly important to prevent overwhelming your child's developing personality with an excessive focus on individualism.\n\nThere are several arguments in favor of individualism, including the freedom to reject current societal attitudes and appearance, which can often be arbitrary. Your path in life should be shaped by your personal history and values, and individualism allows you to express your authentic self. Furthermore, society as a whole benefits from the experimentation and diversity that individualism can generate.\n\nWhile there are certainly advantages to striking your own path in life, it's important to keep in mind that your decisions are not necessarily superior to those of your peers. In fact, the consensus of the majority may have its own unique benefits. Additionally, it's important to consider the potential personal costs of behavior that others may judge harshly.\n\nThe choices involved in embracing individualism are personal, which makes the small costs associated with this behavior worth paying. However, it's also important to consider the impact that your choices may have on those close to you. While the adults in your life have chosen to be part of your journey, the children you give birth to have not been given the choice to be born to you.\n\nThe educational path that you choose for your children is one of life's greatest responsibilities, and this fact should be celebrated. No one should take that privilege away from you. However, it's important to remember that an important aspect of growing up is learning to navigate and adapt to the reactions of peers. While you've already gone through this process and made your own choices, it's essential to recognize that your children haven't given consent to pay the same price. As a parent, it's your responsibility to strike a balance between imparting your beliefs and allowing your children the space to develop their own perspectives.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676970239.0}]
