        "text": "I'm an insider at a fast food pizza place. I work almost exclusively in the front and, because of this, I interact with easily dozens of customers a day. Sometimes it's like playing a\nMineSweeper; you don't know if the next phone call or customer you take is going to be the figurative landmine. \n\nPrior to that awful day in May, I thought all the stories of over-the-top horrendous customers were exaggerated. \"No,\" I thought, \"People aren't THAT bad\". Yes, yes they are.\n\nGretchen isn't her real name, but I wanted to pick a name that suits her ugly personality and blackened soul. She was a well-dressed, middle-aged woman who had an air of condescension around her. \n\nThat night, I was working in the front of the store (as always) with two of my coworkers: Jane, who was taking calls, and Leah, who was preparing the dough. Leah is a tiny girl, but she is a total firecracker - sweet one moment but ready to throw down the next.\n\nIt all started one night when Gretchen called the store to order some pizza and chicken wings. There was no hint of the storm to come when I spoke to her over the phone; it was a perfectly normal order. You should know that you get a free dipping cup for every right wings; Gretchen got 16 wings and so she got two cups.\n\nWe have a policy in the store where extra dipping sauces cost 50 cents each. I think it's dumb and the sauces should be complementary, but it's not my rule.\n\nSo Gretchen comes in to pick up her food. She checked to see if it was correct, and that's when things began to get gnarly.\n\nGretchen [motioning towards the little cups of sauce in the box]: Can you give me some more of these?\n\nMe: Sure, each extra sauce is 50 cents though.\n\nGretchen: Seriously?\n\nMe: Yes, sorry.\n\nGretchen: I just paid for all this food, and you can't even get me some sauce?\n\nMe: I'm sorry ma'am, but they're 50 cents each. \n\nGretchen: Why can't you get me some sauce?\n\nI turn to my coworker Jane for help. She looks up from the computer and says, \"She's right, the sauces cost 50 cents\". Gretchen looks back at me.\n\nGretchen: Why do you need her to speak for you?\n\nMe [caught off guard]: Sorry?\n\nGretchen: Can't you speak English? Why did you look at her like you need her to speak for you?\n\nMe [starting to get angry]: Yes, I do speak English. The sauces are 50 cents. I'm not the one who made that decision, that's corporate.\n\nGretchen: Then bring me the person who makes those decisions.\n\nI turn around and call my manager Bob, who was in the kitchen, over to the front. Honestly, this next part was kinda my fault. Bob asked me what was wrong and I did the \"retail eye roll\" - the look that signals \"We have difficult one\". I thought my head was turned enough that Gretchen couldn't see, but she did.\n\nGretchen: Did you just roll your eyes at me?\n\nMe: Yes. [I mean... no point in lying about it.]\n\nGretchen: What's your name? I want to speak to your manager. \n\nAt this point, Bob saw the situation was escalating and hurried to the front.\n\nBob: What's the problem?\n\nGretchen: This girl rolled her eyes at me. \n\nBob: [inaudible]\n\nGretchen: Nothing, she's standing here acting like a brain surgeon when she just works at [pizza place].\n\nAt this point I began panicking. I was only 1 1/2 months into my job, it's the kind of job with a relatively high turnover rate, and I was already getting reported to the manager? I was like \"Oh shit, I'm going to lose my job\" and I started tearing up. Bob saw this and stepped in front of me.\n\nBob: I understand you're upset, I'll give you her name, but I can't have you insulting my employees. What happened?\n\nI grabbed my phone and went to the back of the store. My coworkers are awesome people, and probably half of them dropped what they were doing to come and console me. Leah basically said \"She's throwing a fit over a fucking sauce, just relax, you're not going to get in trouble\" before going back to the front.\n\nI was in the back, so I didn't hear much of what happened next. Most of the following is from what my coworkers have said: \n\nThe gist of it is that Bob kept telling her she would have to pay for the sauce and Gretchen wasn't having it. She said something about how I shouldn't be working here if I didn't speak English (??) and couldn't handle it, she's rich and we're all trash and uneducated lowlives.\n\nLeah, who was just finishing up her college degree, was not amused. Suddenly, I heard her scream: \"THIS IS HER FIRST JOB! HAVEN'T YOU EVER HAD A FIRST JOB BEFORE!?\"\n\nGretchen: Excuse me??\n\nLeah: Watch, I'm going to be making more money than you in a few years.\n\nGretchen: Oh really?\n\nLeah: Yeah. Bet on it, BITCH. \n\nGretchen turned to Bob.\n\nGretchen: Fetch me my sauce! (Yes, really) \n\nBob: Not until you pay for it.\n\nAngry and realizing he wasn't going to budge, she just grabbed her food and stormed out.\n\n10 minutes later, when I had calmed down, I went back to the front of the store, where Bob and Leah were bickering over whether it's ever a good idea to curse out a customer. Gretchen did end up reporting Bob and I to our general manager, but nothing happened. Hey, at least we got a fun story out of it!",

        "text": "I've had my share of delivery jobs for pizza and Chinese, I've worked the pizza places near campus and delivered to dorms for no tip, I've been pelted with snowballs while trying to deliver food in December.  I've also delivered to drunk frat houses that smelled like piss and they were friendly and gave a great tip.\n\nBack when I was delivering, my rule was, if I know your address and you leave a good tip for the best service, you get your food first, every time.  That's what a tip is for, isn't it?  The customer is paying a little extra for me to go above and beyond.  That's how I treated it.  Known tippers get their food first, that's what they're paying for.\n\nSo, I left the delivery business years ago, and recently bought a house.  My house only has one pizza place that delivers to it.  The first few times I ordered, the pizza took 45 minutes, and it was luke-warm.  No problem, I still throw in a good tip for the guy that delivers to my house.\n\nTonight, I'm too drunk to drive out and buy more cokes for my bourbon &amp; cokes.  I ordered a pizza and a 2-liter.  Within 30 minutes, the guy shows up, my pizza is piping hot, my 2-liter is ice-cold, I gave him $22 on a $17 ticket.\n\nThat's why a tip is valuable people.  You pay for the best service, you get the best service.",

        "text": "Once upon a time, an average pizza delivery man was working fairly late at night. The night was slow, and all the employees were relaxing. When suddenly a wild Mexican appears. He enters the brightly lit store and proceeds to the counter. The delivery man, named Laurim, approaches him and asks, \"How may I help you?\" \n\nThe Mexican man, in broken english, claims he wishes to place an order for delivery. Laurim verifies he actually means delivery. The Mexican man claims \"Yes!\", presenting a small plastic card with a magnetic stripe on the back and a green square and a white script \"H\" on the front. \n\n\"Awesome\", thinks the delivery driver. The Holiday Inn is only a few blocks away, and after working all day, he is ready to turn in his money and be on his way home. \n\n\"And what is your name sir?\"\n\"Jose,\" he replies.\n\nAfter gathering the other required information: room 215, 2 large Hawaiian pizzas, and the man's phone number, Laurim inquires if the payment shall be made instantly, or delayed upon delivery of the edibles.\n \n\"Now\", states Jose, handing over the necessary cash money, with an additional $5 tip. \n\n\"Thank you very much!\"\n\nLaurim alerts Jose that the order should be there in 20-30 minutes, and Jose walks out into the dark foggy night.\n \nAfter preparing the food for the Feast for Jose, the driver loads the delicious circular pies into a 100% cotton blend satchel, its function to seal in the steam arising from the carboard containers.\n\nLaurim enters his black, run-down vehicle and prepares for the journey ahead. Lights? Check. Order? Check. Seatbelt? Check. [Dope ass beats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgeuM-MjBks)? Check. Upon completing the necessary pre-delivery requirements, the driver pulls away from the store and into the wild world ahead. The path along the road was uneventful, and almost monotonous. Having navigated this path many times in the past, it has become routine for Laurim.  After pulling in to the inn's parking area, our hero checks the time display on his phone. 15 minutes have past since his encounter with Jose. He thanks the vessel that brought him and disengages the vehicle and prepares for the long march inside. Seeing the number 215 makes him shiver. Stairs. One of the delivery driver's natural enemies. \n\nGrabbing the warm tote from the area where passengers ride, Laurim stumbles to the passage inside. Through the double doors, he sees no one. The inn is quiet this time of night, as all the visitors prepare for a long night's rest. After traversing the hallways, Laurim prepares for the heavy trek up Stair Mountain. Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he spots a metal panel door with a button nearby.\n \n\"Can it be?!\" he thinks.\nIt is! An elevator! Narrowly avoiding the encounter with the dreaded climb, Laurim presses the button. And waits. and waits. and waits. and waits. His arms grow tired from the weight of the bag. His body slowly slips into a state of exhaustion. When suddenly he hears a noise like an angel. A light ding. Overcome with desire to see his quest through, Laurim enters the metal box with a renewed passion. The elevator was silent, but even the dull, boring, slighty hypnotic music that usually accompanies these magical transportation devices couldn't have dampened his spirits. \n\nUpon reaching the desired floor, Laurim makes quick work of finding his destination. \"215\" the sign reads outside the door.\nA couple brief knocks alerts the residents that their food has arrived. \n\nSuddenly, another wild Mexican appears! He has a surprised look on him as if he was not expecting visitors. \n\n\"Good evening,\" Laurim says with a smile.\n\"Hello,\" replies the confused man. \n\n\"I have two large, delicious, cheesy, Italian staples with me.\"\n\n\"I don't think I ordered that\"\n\nLaurim is a bit confused. In this land, Mexicans are a rare sight. Surely this cannot be a coincidence. \n\n\"Is there anyone else here?\" asks Laurim.\n\n\"Tis just I and my cousin residing here this night. He departed this establishment but an hour ago, and has yet to return,\" the man in the doorway states (in less eloquent vocabulary).  \n\n\"Oh! I think his path lead him to my business. He placed this order and requested I bring this food here. What is your cousin's name?\"\n\n\"Jose.\"\n\nSatisfied that his quest had come to an end, Laurim alerts the man that the food has been paid for and promptly hands the man his food.\n\n\"Have a wonderful night,\" Laurim says, as he turns to leave on his return trip.\n\n\"Wait,\" replies the man, reaching for his wallet. \n\n\"Oh, don't worry. Your cousin tipped me at store.\"\n\n\"I insist,\" the main claims, handing the delivery man $10. \n\n\"Thank you very much!\"\n\nSatisfied with his efforts, Laurim turns and prepares for the long journey home...\n\n\nOkay sorry I'm too lazy to finish writing all this shit out. So basically that guy tips me 10 bucks, I go back to the store, take a couple more deliveries, and am about to cash out. The first Jose calls the store asking if we're having trouble finding him. I tell him about his cousin and he laughs and says he doesn't have a cousin with him. I verify the room number, the hotel, everything. Super confused. I ask him if he can ask someone the address. He says he'll find out and call me back. He's at the holiday inn. But he's at the one 10 miles outside our delivery area (that I didn't even know existed). Since he had already paid cash for the order, I tell him I'll take it. We remake the food and I drive all the way there. He's super nice and laughing when I explain what happened and tips me another $15.\n\n**WTL;DR**: 2 Joses in the same room number of different Holiday Inns in an area with very few Mexicans. Got $30 in tips out of it.",

It's been a great college job for me and I genuinely enjoy most work days and like my co-workers. I used to have a great 4-door Mercury Milan that was great for delivery driving but that car is no longer in my possesion and more recently I am driving a 2007 Dodge Ram 1500 SXT - It's a big truck. Not like a big big truck, but it's a decently large automobile for sure. The kicker is that when it was given to me it had about 109K miles on it. It delivered great for a while and I was learning how to city drive a large truck pretty good but more recently I've had problem after problem. Had to replace all my brakes and flip rotors, had to buy and replace my alternator, had to get my fuel injection system looked at, had to get all new tires, had to get a new battery, etc etc. I get that car maintenance is part of the job but I've sank a considerable amount of my money I get delivering back into the vehicle that is getting it done. \n\nI have a closing shift in two hours and my check engine light came on when I was out running errands just now and I am just about to break down. Trucks aren't meant for this job, and I'm no mechanic, I have no other options vehicle wise and I can't run this truck into the ground this truck gets me to and from my college classes every day which is far more important to me. \n\nHas anyone delivered on a check engine light for a while? Should I look for a new job? Is a Ram 1500 with now about 120K miles on it ever going to run without problems doing this type of work again? I just feel so defeated right now.  ",

I had, and still have, a membership there, and I love the place…\n\n....Except for the deliveries I made there for their kids' parties.\n\nUsually, I'd deliver almost $100 worth of pizza, and get like $2-5 in tips. And that was if the parents were nicer (read: less rude) than usual.\n\n_____\n\nOne woman wanted her pizzas cut into 12 slices instead of 8. Except she forgot to tell the person over the phone that.\n\nShe started screaming in my face about how useless the pizzas were in 8 slices and that I either had to cut them right then and there, or have them remade.\n\nI was in a rush as I had two other deliveries on that run, and there was no way the shop would remake pizzas just because they weren't sliced enough.\n\nI somehow managed to convince her to give me 5 minutes, and I rushed to the shop and grabbed a cutter, rushed back and sliced the pizzas into 16.\n\nThat wasn't good enough because she wanted *12*, but that wasn't possible at that point so she had to accept it.\n\nNo tip on a $80 order. And that was BEFORE she noticed the slices weren't correct.\n\n_______\n\nAnother woman called in at the absolute last minute for her kid's party.\n\nShe was very specific about what she wanted, when she wanted it, and how she was going to pay by card (this is important). Not really in a rude way, but she had to ensure it was *perfect*.\n\nI had to rush the pizzas over, since she called at the last possible second for them to make it there by that time, and there were 3 other orders up.\n\nI get to the gym, only to find that she dropped her kid off and left. For his own birthday party. She couldn't be bothered to go to her own son's birthday party.\n\nUpon being told this, I nearly screamed. \n\nMy face was stuck in what I call my \"I'm going to strangle you with your entrails\" expression, and my eye started involuntarily twitching. I practically demanded that I good the pizzas until either the gym or me called her to come over and sign the receipt. Due to liability issues (and two really rude customers), I would only let the card holder sign.\n\nWell, turns out the woman was headed out of town for the afternoon, and wouldn't be back until the party was over (two hours later).\n\nI nearly chewed the front counters' heads off in my anger, but I had to accept the fact that the woman indirectly authorized them to take care of the signing the card (something about their contracts allows for that if need be).\n\nI did go back later after my shift and apologized to the guy at the counter who was still there, but he just laughed it off, saying he 100% understood everything. \n\nApparently he's the one who sets up the parties.\n\n_____\n\n\nTL;DR I love going to my gym, just not as a pizza guy.",

        "text": "A minor annoyance happened during lunch rush this afternoon. Nothing to write a great story about.  In fact, what I'm about to describe happens fairly often. Nonetheless, I was having a bad day, so this time I was more ticked off than I'd usually be over this incident.\n\nSo, I take a run to the daycare. (Some drivers hate hospitals? Well, I hate daycare centers! There's almost always a problem.) I drive seven miles one-way.  I get there and all the staff are confused, because the girl who works there, who placed the order, had  called out from work today.\n\nO.k., I'll try calling. It goes to voicemail, so I try again. No answer. I take it back to the store. I was out of the store for about 35 minutes with three other runs waiting. To make matters worse, I got stuck behind a school bus stopping every 500 feet the last three miles back to the store.\n\nAbout an hour later, a girl calls looking for her food. The teenage twit answering the phones tells her it was delivered a long time ago. She says she didn't get it! The girl taking the call calls me over and asks me, \"You delivered it already, right?\"\n\nI take over the phone and say, \"Hello! Thanks for calling. How can I help you?\" I listen to her story before  I tell the customer that I'm sorry! That I had tried to deliver to 15 Danielle Drive, but she wasn't there. I tried calling, but got no answer. \n\nShe says \"No, I've ordered from there before, but I'm at home today!  That's my work you delivered to!\"\n\nAt this point, I already think I know what has happened, but I don't let on. So I ask, \"When you placed your order,  did you let them know your address?\"\n\nSure enough, she responds with exactly what I expect...\n\n\"Uh no, they never asked!\"\n\n*Face in hands, trying to sound concerned.\n\nMe: \"Well m'am, if you don't tell us your address, we tend to have a hard time delivering your food. I'm afraid the person who took your order saw the previous address on file and assumed you were there? They should have confirmed the address, but for some reason they didn't, so we dispatched your order to the address we have on file. I tried calling, but I got no answer. \n\nShe says \"Sorry, I didn't recognize the number.\"\n\nThe girl sounds confused and slightly annoyed.  She then sighs over the phone and replies \"Uh... Ohh, yeah, I didn't think of that!\"\n\nI explain that in the future, if our phone person doesn't confirm her address, she MUST be sure to let us know which address she'd like delivered to.  I tell her I'll run it right over.  Turns out, she lives less than a quarter mile down the street from the store. I could have walked it down! \n\nWhen I get there, she's happy to get her sandwich, soda and chips, but gives me a dollar instead of the usual three I get at that address. I'm hustling to get back to my other deliveries. As I jump off her steps going back to my car, I feel something squishy under my right foot. Not thinking much about it, I jump in my car, put the peddle to the metal, and then a God awful stench hits me. It could only be one thing. I've smelled this before.... Dog Poop! \n\nIt's all over the driver side carpet of my car! It's raining out, so it's extra runny and extra dank, eggy smelling, and slightly rotten. Actually, I think this dog must have been sick? Still haven't attempted to clean it up. It's going to be a little work! Got to wait until the sun comes up.\n\nNow I've seen this happen time and time again. Yet, it never ceases to amaze me people will order and just assume you know the address.  Even customer's who aren't even on file do this from time to time. It's like ordering to a huge hotel and not thinking to them your room number when you place your order! What's with some people?\n\nHowever, I've also learned in the past to never place blame on the customer before you know who's at fault.  Although I anticipated this was going to be the customer's fault, I've also been in these situations where you think the customer was an idiot, but it really turns out to be the the person taking the order who screwed up. Therefore, I'm always careful to not show any sign of annoyance in these situations. \n\nJust another day delivering and dealing with the trivial, but frustrating things we deal with.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I'm a deliver driver for Dominoes but spend some time in store between runs. In the area I work in, there are a lot of people who don't speak English. A few interesting things happened last week.\nFirstly, I hate it when people come in the store who don't speak English and substitute that for whispering in their native language....as if somehow I will understand what they are saying even though 1. I don't speak that language, and 2. They are whispering. So the second resort they have is not to speak, but to point at what they want. Problem with that is they usually point at a poster of something that I cannot see because its either outside the store, or on the wall that I cannot see without jumping over the counter and going into the waiting area. \n\nThe other thing that happened last week was we had these guys come in and order a pizza, then when it was ready, they tried to take it from my co-worker without paying. Once they were told they didn't pay and can't take it, they ran away from the store. The returned 10 minutes later with 4 more huge dudes, demanding the pizza. We didn't give it to them so they left the store. An hour later, we get a delivery to the guy at his house. They sent our biggest delivery driver. He comes back with the pizza and no money, saying that the guy tried to take the pizza from his hands without paying, and that he followed him back to his car when he wouldn't hand over the food. The police were called. ",

Seemed odd but we went with it.\n\nOur guy comes in and I start bringing the pizzas out to him.\n\nMe: \"Big party tonight huh?\" \n\nCustomer: \"uuuhhhhh didn't plan on one! Who are all these pizzas for?\"\n\n*heart sinks*\n\nMe: \"Jen! Come here for a sec.\"\n\nJen goes on to explain that she misheard the customer. What he was saying was,\n\n\"I need a pizza with 2 pieces pineapple, 2 pieces pepperoni, and 4 pieces cheese.\"\n\nJen interpreted \"pieces\" as \"pizzas\" and now we're stuck with 7 pizzas and Jen is crying.\n\nLucky for her it was the summer and there's a little league up the street. They took the pizzas off our hands for us. Still one of the most epic order mix-ups  I've come across in 10 years. \n\nGotta love Jen.",

        "text": "Late last night, I took a couple of medium pizzas with extra cheese to one of our slightly sketchy apartment complexes. I knock on the door and I'm greeted by a girl who looks to be about 15. Out of the corner of my eye, I can see her friend (about the same age as her) peeking at us and hiding behind the corner halfway into the hallway. The girl at the door, looking super confused, asks how much it is and I tell her $21.84. She's holding a twenty, a five, and three singles. She hands me the twenty and two of the singles before asking, \"is that enough?\" So this is the moment where I think \"Oh shit, no tip... it's whatever though\" but I keep my happy face on and tell her that yes, $22 covers the order total and I hand her the food. At this point, she looks more confused than before and starts to walk off but asks me to wait. She says something in Spanish to her friend and after they go back and forth for a minute, she hands her friend the remaining $6. So her friend comes up to me with an equally confused expression on her face and after a moment of uncomfortable silence, she says \"oh... um... do you want your tip?\" No shit I want my tip! \"Sure! Thank you!\" I respond. So then she hands the remaining $6 to me, thanks me, and shuts the door. It was just an all\n around odd encounter, but a surprise $6 tip came of it,  so I can't complain.\n\nEdit: forgot a word whoops",

A person ordered 2 pizzas on gluten free crust, with the non-gluten free toppings. This was an online order, and there is a pop up that warns them if they are ordering a gluten free with gluten-y toppings.  I decide to call anyway, to confirm. Call once, no answer. Call again, no answer, but this time, the rings were cut off early, indicating an \"ignored\" call.  I leave a message, and say we're going to make and deliver the pizzas like normal (because it was an online order, we usually just put it through as is; it's how they ordered it, so if it's not what they actually wanted it is what they ordered. Plus if we called every time we got a weird online pizza that's all we'd have time for).  We get the pizzas in the oven... the phone rings... and now we have to remake the pizzas without the gluten ingredient because they didn't answer their phone the first time AND IGNORED THE POP UP FROM THE WEBSITE.\n\nExtending the story, to more people who won't answer their phones:\nWe deliver to dorms a lot, so we need to call for kids to come down to get their pizzas.  I do not understand the people who don't answer the phone when they know food is coming.\nWe have drivers from out of the area, who have different area codes, and so when they call, people don't answer. We've literally had people call and say that no one called them, BUT they have a missed call from an out of area number. We have to explain that it was probably their driver, and their excuse is that they don't answer phones from other area codes. (I generally don't either, but I don't know my delivery drivers' lives; if I know food is coming, I'll answer whatever call.)\n\nTL;DR: People who don't answer their phones make me salty. ",

This latest delivery had a delivery remark of \"the bell doesn't work please call my phone\". Well, that's going to be difficult since I give me cell phone to my wife so if she has an emergency she can call for help. We don't make a lot of money since I have to rely on tips to earn a living and my employer won't provide me with a cell phone to call customers when they make these sorts of requests. And why should I call? Why can't I just knock on the door? Ohh yeah.. that's because this inconsiderate customer isn't in their call box.\n\nSo I call before I leave the store and let this customer know that I'll be arriving at her location in approximately 5-10 minutes and that if she's not in the call box I'll need her to meet me at the entrance. Holy shit.... this bitch just goes off on me... \"No, your tip is dependent on whether you call me when you arrive. I will not wait for you. If you don't call me I will complain to your manager and get you fired. I know my rights!!!\"\n\nI try to explain to the customer \"Maam, I do not have a cell phone, I have to leave it with my wife because our daughter is very sick and might need the phone more then me. I've asked my employer to provide me with a phone so I can call customers like you, but they refuse. So I don't know what else to do. I will be there in 5 - 10 minutes, I'll wait for 5 minutes, if you haven't shown up in that time I will, unfortunately, have to leave for my second delivery. The choice is yours whether your delivery will be delayed. I hope to see you in the next 5 10 minutes.\"\n\n\"Now hold the fuck on, you do not tell me where I need to be, I am paying for that food so you have to do what I tell you. If you don't call me I'll make sure you get fired.\"\n\n\"Very well maam, I'll be there in 5 - 10 minutes.\"\n\nI then left on my deliveries, dreading the possible confrontation.\n\nSo I arrive at the location, within the 5 - 10 minute time frame, and I wait. I wait 5 minutes, then I leave. I head to my next delivery and then back to the store.\n\nAs I arrive I check the deliveries back in and walk over to the manager to let him know what happened. My manager asks if I called the customer. I told him that I did call the customer, right before I left and informed her when I would be there and how long I would wait for her. My manager asked why I did not call the customer when I arrived. I explained that I don't have a cell phone, I hav e to leave it with my wife because my child is sick and because I have asked multiple times to be provided with a cell phone so I can call customers like this, and every single time you've told me that you will not provide me with a cell phone. What am I to do when you will not provide me with the tools to do my job?\n\nThe manager tells me that the customer called back and laid into him, saying that I was cursing at her, making sexual advances, and threatening her. I denied all of that and reminded the manager that the calls are recorded (for quality assurances) and that if he'd like to review the call I made he should.\n\nThe manager said I needed to go back out and call the customer once I arrived. I told the manager, \"Sure, I'll need additional mileage for that run.\" The manager agreed and gave me another dollar.\n\nI then pointed out that I still could not call her when I arrived because I do not have a cell phone, will you be giving me your cell phone to call the customer? My manager got angry but gave me his cell phone. He also told me that he was going to call the customer and let her know I was heading back with the remade pizza (because obviously she cannot have the original pizza).\n\nI arrived at the customer's location, and called her with my manager's phone. No answer.\n\nI called again. No answer.\n\nI waited 2 minutes, then called a third time. No answer. I left a voicemail explaining that I was at the entrance to her building and I was waiting for her. I waited 10 minutes. The phone rang. It was my manager. He was angry with me. He had just got a call from the customer. She was yelling at him that I kept calling and it woke her baby up, she was demanding to know why didn't I just text her once and wait?\n\nI told my manager that I am not feeling comfortable about this delivery anymore, I don't feel safe. This customer is crazy. I am going to return to the store.\n\nThanksgiving eve was so great!! Customers are so great!! I just love customers that only tell the truth and don't try to get me fired.\n\nEdit: I got back to the store and my manager is freaking out. Apparently he gave the customer the number to his boss and he's afraid that he'll be fired now.\n\nEdit 2: This chick showed up to the store, yelling and screaming about how we woke up her baby and threatening to \"kick our scrawny asses\" if we didn't immediately give her the pizza she paid for. For the record she hadn't paid for anything yet, she chose cash as a payment type. Since the delivery never completed, she'd never paid for anything.\n\nEdit 3: We called the police and she's on her way to jail for all sorts of shit.\n",

I was wondering what y'all's experiences were with college RAs.\n\nThe ones on mine are either decent tippers (12%-15%) or straight up stiff me and go so far as to draw a line through the tip space on the receipt. It used to be that no RAs would tip any of our drivers, and we hated it when we had to deliver to an RA.\n\nI mentioned it to one of the RAs who actually tipped me and he told me that the university actually told them not to tip. I was blown away. Luckily, I was able to complain to one of my buddies who is an RA and a select few have started to tip our drivers.",

We live in a secure building but I don't really know what to do.

        "text": "**Edit:** I seem to have made a serious mistake when composing this story. I changed the addresses but in the process of writing the story wrote the wrong street multiple times. I've gone back through and changed the mistakes.\n\nThis story is real. To protect the innocent names and addresses have been changed.\n\nSo a few weeks ago I was working a 4pm - 11pm closing shift. It was getting on towards 10:30pm when the phone rang. The shift lead (manager) answered the phone and took the order. While the shift lead was making the order, I sitting on my ass reading this sub on my smartphone, another order came in through the online order system.\n\nI took a look at the dispatch screen and thought to myself, \"Sweet, those two deliveries are only like 4 blocks apart. I'll take them as a double.\" So I go back to reading the comments other have made on other stories. \n\nAbout 10 minutes later I've cut and boxed the orders and head out. Now my first delivery is to 2420 5th St, no problem I know where 5th St is. I also know that the address will be on the north side of the road, the side I am driving on. As I am coming to 25th Ave I slow down, whip out my flash light, and roll down the passenger side window so I can find the address. Ok I'm now passing 25th St... hmmm fence.... more fence... ok theres some more fence... still more fence... ok that's a different colored fence... more fence... and more fence... and 24th Ave.\n\n\"*That's strange.*\" I thought to myself. Let's drive back the other way... Fence... nothing but fence on the north side of the road. Fences, bushes, and very small trees. Not a single house fronting on 5th St.\n\nOk.. Head to the second delivery. Ok.. fucker does not have the porch light on. Walking up to the garage door... \"HOLY FUCK!! that spotlight is bright!\" (motion detector) Ok. I can now see, still no porch light though. Knock on the door, complete transaction.. sweet a $1.43 tip (this cheap fuck... I'll remember him).\n\nOk.. Now let's try this again I'll head out back the way I came in. And.. nope... no new houses have appeared on 5th Ave in the last 5 minutes. Back to the store!!!\n\nI get back to the store and let the shift lead know, \"Hey fucker this address doesn't exist.\" (Yes, I did say this. I have that type of relationship with the shift lead. It's all in fun... LOL that's what they think.)\n\nShift lead is like, \"Uhmm, ok I'll call them.\"\n\nSO the shift lead calls the customer, I wait while he talks to the customer to verify the address. Well, according to the customer that's the correct address. I'm like \"No, there are no houses on 5th St between 24th Ave and 25th Ave Have the customer verify the address by finding a piece of mail or something. That address does  not exist. If the address is wrong and in our delivery area, I'll go back out, but that address does not exist.\"\n\nShift lead talks to the customer again for a few seconds and then hangs up. He looks at me and says \"They're coming to pick it up.\"\n\nI'm thinking to myself, \"*Well that's fucking great. I can't log out until they fucking get here and it's going to take them at least 10 minutes to drive here.*\"\n\nBut I say, \"Ok. Did you want to transfer the order to a carryout?\"\n\nShift leads says, \"No, they'll pay full price. They said they'd come pick it up and asked 'well, what are you going to do for me?' I told them 'Nothing.' \"\n\nI replied, \"Good for you. Shit now I have to wait for them since it's on my till.\"\n\nOk.. so I go and edit my tips for the night, that takes about 1 minute. We're now about 3 minutes since the shift lead got off the phone with the customer. There's a car pulling into the parking spot right in front of the store.\n\nI grab the order and head towards the locked front door. A woman gets out of the car and proceeds to try to open our front door (it's locked.. what an IC). I open the door and ask \"Are you customer?\"\n\nShe's like, \"Ya I am customer.\"\n\nI say, \"Your total is $27.24.\"\n\nShe pulls out some bills, she's got a $20, a $10, and a couple $1 bills. She hands be a $20 and $10. I say, \"Hold on I'll be right back with your change.\"\n\nShe's like, \"It's ok, keep it.\" Sweet a tip on a delivery where the customer decided to drive to the store to pick it up.\n\nAnd we're done.\n\nAs soon as the door closes and the customer gets back in her car I'm saying to my shift lead, \"No fucking way did they just drive here from 5th St. It takes at least 10 minutes to make that drive.\"\n\n",

Like, that's way outside of our delivery area.\n\nAnyway, it wasn't even a corporate pizza party, it was just some dude that worked there that ordered four pizzas. Now, here's the problem. He called from a company phone. Whoever took the order didn't bother to get the correct name, apparently. I haven't been to this particular building, because the front door is on a side road.\n\nI pull up to the address; it's a loading bay. Okay, find a door. Some guys outside smoking, \"Hey, do you know GenericCustomer?\" One guy says, \"Yeah, let me page for him.\"\nGenericCustomer shows up, \"I didn't order pizza, sorry man.\"\n\nOkay, I say to myself. I call the phone number on the receipt. Pre-recorded message: \"Thank you for calling Scholastic. We are currently-\" Blah blah blah. Whatever, man. I can't find you, no pizza for you. Head back on my ten mile drive. Barely make it to the store, and boss calls, \"Hey, Scholastic called wondering where their pizza was.\" I explain my case. \"Yeah, well the name is actually Customer 2, not Customer 1.\" Well that's peachy.\n\nDrive all the way back, page for Customer 2. He's around front. Oh, I say, this isn't the front door? WHY THE HELL IS IT ON ALGOA ROAD, THEN?! The address is Algoa Road, but the front door is on a side road. What the hell kind of building is this? Drive to the \"front\", and there's a beautifully lit front desk with a heavyset black lady guard. Intercom for Customer 2.\n\nBlack guy with his jeans sagging to his ankles walks in and does NOT make eye contact. I'm scanning for body language, and notice his disinterest. Not my guy. \"How much is it?\" he says. What the fuck, man. Work with me here. It's $33.75. He gives me $35. I try to maintain a positive attitude, \"Weirdest delivery ever, I think. The front door is all the way back here...\" His friend with him says, \"Yeah, it took the longest too.\" I had to focus every fiber of my being into not yelling at his stupid face, \"SHUT YOUR STUPID BROKE ASS MOUTH.\"\n\nBut I digress. Wrong name. Wrong number. Front door to the building is in the back. Outside of town. Jesus, man. A one dollar tip. Come on.",

I get there, and knock on the door, and about 10 seconds later, a man in all black with a ski mask comes around the corner holding a gun at me. He doesn't say anything, but I know the score here, so I take my driver bag and wallet and drop them on the floor in front of me.\n\nAt this point I start to step back, and the man puts his gloved hand on my shoulder and pounds on the door of the house I was supposed to be delivering to. After a very tense few seconds, the door opens, and another man dressed in all black with a fucking M16 opens the door. I'm pushed inside, and at this point I'm starting to freak out. The entry hallway is covered in blood, and there's 2 people laying down already, I thought that they had been shot. The man with with pistol motions for me to sit down, and I sit my ass down, while 2 other robbers ransack the house. \n\nThis goes on for about a minute, and then they leave.

The owners leave to take the injured man to the hospital, and I hightail it back to the store, and spend the next 3 hours talking to cops.

If this is illegal, how should I go about asking my boss to either start paying mileage or cut me some of the delivery fee?",

Not to get too deep into it but I love delivering food... but kinda hate Postmates but it's been working and I'm averaging about $20/hr. Now... having no prior experience and no training and only manned with my 170cc scooter and DIY rear rack with wire crate I hit the streets.\n\nAfter 3 days I'm basically a master of navigating and getting to places well on time. My main problem is how to keep food hot and how to keep it secure?\n\nI've been rejecting orders for pizza delivery because I honestly don't know where I can stash a pizza. I am looking into pizza bags but which one's do you guys prefer? It makes sense to me to get something that could be used for both pizza and other food and thinking of going with a 20\" X 20\" or larger. Does such a thing as a 12v DC heated pizza bag or heater exist? I have a 12v DC power port on my scooter but that might just be overkill.\n\nSecond problem... drinks. A couple of days ago I was dropping off a supersized drink to some guy and bungie corded it down to my wire basket as best as I could. I had the restaurant put it in a plastic bag to minimize any leakage. Apparently not good enough. When I arrived at my destination I look back in horror as the bag was about the burst with liquid. The cup cracked and the entire contents leaked into it like a beta fish at a cheap carnival. The guy was understanding about the drink but it turns out his entire order was wrong on top of that lol. Somehow I still got a tip? There are good humans left in this world after all. My scooter has dual shocks so the ride is pretty smooth but how the hell do I keep this from happening again??? I so far have just been turning down orders with drinks or pizza but would love some suggestions on how you guys handle this.",

        "text": "The following story is a tale from my early years delivering for Domino's\n\n This event happened 14 years ago when I was 21 years old. It's not something I've ever shared with anybody, because, quite frankly, I am too ashamed. \n\n I was working day shift.  Just coming out of the lunch rush. Took a delivery to a medical building, and of course, I got stiffed! Who would imagine, huh?  On the way back to the store,  I was pissed at the stiff. I was too much of a rookie delivery driver to have learned not to get upset about a routine stiff. \n\n I'm driving down the road. Probably listening to Rage Against the Machine or Limp Biskit.  Probably driving a bit too fast in my irritated state? Of course, just as I'm making good time, what do you know?  A Buick, with a little old lady driving, pulls out in front of me doing ten under the limit.  \n\n As I close in behind her, I notice something on the roof.  As we go up a hill and around a steep curve, the item falls off and rolls off the to side of the road.  Curious, I make a U-turn to go back and investigate.\n\n I drive back and get out of my car to discover an old lady purse.  You know, the kind they can almost fit everything they own in and still have enough space to use as a casket when the Grim Reaper comes calling?\n\n I open it it up to see if there's an I.D.  There is. There's also a whole lot more! Numerous credit cards, cell phone, prescription medications, gum, and things you'd expect to find in a purse belonging to a 70 year old woman. There's also medical paperwork concerning an upcoming open-heart surgery scheduled a few days from then.  There's about $40 in small bills.  Then I dig deeper and find a place where there was some more cash stashed.\n\nFirst, I started pulling out $20 bills.  About $100.  Then comes the $50's, and finally the $100's!  In all, it totaled $477 in cash! Payday to this driver!\n\nI was in shock!  What should I do?  The devil talking on one side of my head said to keep it.  The angel on the other side told me to return it.  After all, I had this lady's address from her license. I could easily bring it to her. \n\nThat night after work, I decided to go scope the woman's house out.  To see if she appeared more well off, or, to see if she seemed poor?   Driving by the house, it was obvious she wasn't hurting financially. It was a nice upper-middle class house with a $100,000+ RV Camper sitting in the driveway. Plus, an in-ground pool and a Audi.\n\nIt was then that I decided to bank the money! I'd just returned from a summer of backpacking around Europe and had some credit card debt to pay off. I took the cash and tossed the purse and the rest of the contents in my car's trunk. \n\nAs the year went on, this lady started ordering large deliveries for her weekend family get togethers.  She always tipped me beyond well, and would invite me in while she went to get money.  She was the sweetest old lady!  The deliveries to her continued for years.  Each time, I felt a little more guilty as I would be waiting in her living room for the inevitable $10 tip she would always give, all the while having no idea the delivery driver standing in her living room was the one who had taken her purse years ago.  When she started telling me I was her favorite driver, the guilt was a lot to take.\n\nI was still living at home about six months later, when one day my father got into the back of my car for whatever reason?  He discovered the purse and wanted to know why I had it?  I made some lame excuse that a friend or somebody I'd given a ride to must have left it or something?  To my horror, he told me he had brought it to the police station to return to the owner!  Not sure why he never questioned why I had an elderly woman's purse in my car? Perhaps he never looked at the I.D.? \n\nNothing ever came of taking it to the police.  I continued to deliver awkward deliveries to this lady for years after. Feeling more and more guilty each time!\n\nFinally, a couple years ago I'd had enough of my conscience nagging at me. I decided to make things right.  For about a year, I kept putting a couple dollars aside here and there.  Eventually, the amount I'd saved amounted to $477.\n\nOne day I went to the 7/11.  I purchased a Western Union money order for $477.  I wrote a quick anonymous letter explaining what had happened years ago. Although, I never mentioned I was a pizza deliver driver. Or, the fact I'd been delivering to her for years since that day.  I simply said that I was sorry and regretted that I hadn't returned her money all those years before.   That I wanted to make things right.  I put the note and check in the mail and sent it to her. \n\nI no longer feel guilt.  I felt like I lost about $500, but then again, I guess I got a taste of what this lady experienced all those years ago?  It was worth it to clear my conscious.  To be young and stupid...\n",

        "text": " \n When I worked for Domino's I saw some gross things.  I also ate a lot of gross things.  (Primarily the Domino's product!) However, it was free while I was on the clock, so I ate it for the content and to drive off the hunger during long shifts. \n\nAs is the case in a lot of stores, staff eat copious amounts of the product.  It doesn't matter if it's against the rules, or suppose to be paid for, the staff usually eats their fair share of the inventory.  My boss was cool, though.  He figured that if you let people eat as much as they'd like, within a short time, they're so sick of the food, they quit eating much of it. If any?\n \nWell, one day we had a crew pie under the heat rack. I'd taken a few slices for myself, with a cup of garlic sauce and a few Cinnastix, and I'd been eating them out of a Cheese Bread box while waiting for a delivery.  All of a sudden calls started coming in and I was needed on the phones. I threw my box of half eaten food under the heat rack. (It was common at our store for crew to put their food up there) and ran to answer the phone. \n\nAfter I got done taking the order,  I rushed to get my deliveries and get out the door.   I was due to make a delivery to a motel seven miles away, about 15 minutes ago.  Time to hustle! I hastily got my deliveries in order, grabbed my box of food, and rushed out the door.\n\nDropped all my deliveries off in record time. Customer at motel was very nice elderly gentleman and his wife. Probably around 80 years old?  They gave me an above average tip on their small order. \n\nI raced back to the store to pick up more deliveries.  When I got back, the Shift leader was on the phone with a customer. I could tell it was a complaint.  I glanced at the computer screen and noticed it was the elderly couple at the motel. \n\nWhen he got off the phone, he called me over. There was a problem with the order to the motel, alright! A big problem! The problem was my half eaten dinner, complete with dirty napkins and fork had been delivered to this man instead of the Cheese Bread he ordered!\n\nIn my rush to get out the door, I'd accidentally grabbed my box of food and mixed it up with this gentleman's delivery! He got my half eaten pizza and Cinnasticks, complete with greasy fingerprints all over the box. His Cheese Bread was still in my car, in the box that I thought contained the food I'd accidentally given him! \n\nWe offered him a remake. We offered him a refund. We offered him both, plus a free order the next time. It didn't matter. He didn't want any of that. Not even his money back.  All he could exclaim was that he'd \"lost his Goddamned appetite\" and was feeling queazy and sick to his stomach. \"Was this some kind of sick practical joke? Because it's certainly sick! What's wrong with you people down there? Just keep the money, I'm going to go throw up!\" \n\nThat was the last we heard from him. We kept the money for the order and had a good laugh after all was said and done. Although, I admit, that was pretty damn disgusting! One of my most memorable screw ups.\n\n Man, I felt bad, but it was still pretty hilarious looking back on it. \n\n",

I put the order in and my manager makes a beautiful pie since we had time to make to put more effort into it. 20 minutes later the customer and her boyfriend pick up their pizza and go on their way. 30 minutes later we get a call, some how her pizza is covered in pepperoni and isn't a Hawaiian. Common mistake, someone gave her the wrong order. That seemed too suspicious for these people. While my manager was on the phone with the wronged people I checked our order log; we did not have a medium pizza with pepperoni in the store when they picked up their pizza. I told him and showed him the proof that they were obviously lying. Luckily for the thieves my manager was a big teddy bear and gave their account a free replacement anyway.",

Sure no problem let me get my supervisor.\n\nNow my supervisor starts trying to get to the bottom of it, asking for her phone number and name, neither of which are in this system. \n\nHe asks if perhaps the account is under a different name or phone number and she insists that it's not and that it shouldn't be that hard.\n\nAfter confirming the phone number one more time, he asks if she's sure she ordered from our particular location, informs her that we have quite a few locations and that it happens regularly.\n\nWoman: \"I'm not stupid. I know which store I ordered from.\"\n\nSupervisor: \"Ok, well unfortunately I can't find your information in our system ma'am.\" \n\nWoman: \"Jesus Christ how incompetent are you people over there?\" *Starts rambling about how rich and smart she is and how it shouldn't be hard to work at a pizza parlor*  \"I have the old box right in front of me! There's a sticker on it that says order number 348!!!\"\n\nNow at this point we knew she was either straight up lying, or really did call the wrong store because, our particular location was the slowest store in the entire chain. We never once had our order numbers hit 300, and very rarely would it surpass 200. So this is what happens next,\n\nSupervisor: Ok I apologize ma'am but perhaps you did call another location because our orders never reach that number...\"\n\nWoman: \"What is your name?!?\"\n\nSupervisor: \"RandomUncommonName\"\n\nWoman: \"What kind of name is that? That's a stupid fucking name. I'm going to call your General Manager and have a talk with them about the quality of service here this is fucking stupid.\"\n\nSupervisor: Ok have a nice day ma'am.\n\nShe never called back I'm just assuming she was trying to use a scare tactic to get free pizza, but like, what the fuck dude.",

        "text": "This is going to be kind of long, I apologize for that. But I have to tell this story, and tell it in full. \n\nSo Sunday night, I'm closing manager, and I'm on cut table. And the guy I had jumping to phones comes and tells me there's a guy on the phone who says he's supposed to be getting a delivery, but there isn't anything in the system relating to him. \n\nA driver (who used to be a manager) and I go up to one of the registers, and search the system for the number this guy is calling from, the hotel number that he says he's at, and then just go through all orders from the day, open and closed, to see if we can find this damn order. There's nothing. \n\nSo I take the guy off of hold, apologize, for the wait etc, and introduce myself. He starts to go off on the whole \"Where's my pizza?\" deal we all know and *love.* \n\nSo I ask him which hotel he is in again, he says it's fancy hotel near all the fancy shmancy stores. I confirm his cell phone number and search again, while we talk, find nothing, inform him of this. He goes off about how whoever had answered the phone and took his order didn't even ask for his phone number. Which I know exactly who that was, and this is another reason to dislike working with him, and I'm flabberghasted he's still a fellow manager at my store, honestly. So anyway, I say I'm searching for the hotel now, find nothing. I ask him to repeat and spell his name, and I search yet *again* and still turn up nada, except for others with the same name with addresses on the opposite side of town from fancy hotel. All the while he's going off *again* about how who took his order never asked for a name either. (God damn it, fellow manager why the fuck do you do this to everyone who's order you take??) \nI inform him each time I searched, that it wasn't turning up any orders, and what orders I did find were from days, months ago, and were closed. \n\nI admit I was frustrated, but I was being as nice as I could be, because, well, that's a huge fucking part of my job. I've been in food service, call centers, customer service, retail, all of it, for a very long time. I was apologizing profusely for all of this. One mistake I made, I think, was asking if he was sure My Pizza Place located on such road in this city was the one he placed the order with, perhaps he ended up speaking with one of the other My Pizza Places in the area in the next town over. I did not, however, accuse him of anything, because Customers hate being accused of stuff. \n\nAll the while, I'm still apologizing, and saying that I will do whatever it takes to fix whatever the hell went wrong (minus the curse words, I just say them here because god damn did this episode make me want to curse and it's just how I relate the story now). \n\nThis is where it goes even more to hell, maybe. He starts yelling at me, saying that I'm \"giving him the third degree\" that I'm \"treating him like sort of criminal\" and on and on. \n\nAnd I couldn't help it. I burst out crying, telling him I apologize, that all I was doing was trying to find the order, and fix everything. Then he notices that I'm actually sobbing, and tells me I shouldn't have any damn reason to cry. \n\nI do, I'm being yelled at for trying to help the guy, being blamed for the first mistakes, and not to mention shit going on in my personal life is, of course, going to also be a factor on my emotional state at any given moment, because I'm human and not Vulcan. \n\nThe driver I originally conferred with before I took the call, he's right behind me now, and I just give him the phone, and thankfully he's known me for years, and knows I don't cry willy nilly for no reason like some offended and triggered tumblrina, so he knows this whole thing went WAY wrong. \n\nI go outside and out back, to get some precious nicotine and compose myself, and lo and behold, there is my SO talking with fellow manager (henceforth known as FM) who fucked up this guy's order in the first place. I go off on him, and SO knows I wouldn't cry over a customer usually, or yell at FM for not getting a name, etc on an order. FM calls up the hotel, and he asks for room number whatever, that he at least knew and got the info of. Ha. Anyway, he's connected, he talks to dude, also apologizing, blah blah blah, and I couldn't hear what else was said, I walked away so as not to end up saying something I shouldn't, since FM had the guy on speakerphone. \n\nThe call ends, I'm 10 feet away, and I hear my SO go \"Man, that guy *WAS* a fucking douche!\" Driver comes out of the store on a run, and he says dude didn't even want to talk to him, just yelled something at him and hung up. \n\n20 minutes later, another driver comes into the store. He asks me \"What did you guys do to dude at Fancy Hotel??\" I ask what he means, and he says that dude was *crying,* tears literally streaming down his face and everything when he got there with his order. \n\nChrist what a weird turn of events. \n\nOh and the reason, I couldn't find it? The name on the order was for a woman, in a room 4 floors away from dude. \n\nHow that happened, I don't know. \n\nBut god damn, was that one of the most draining experiences I've had, and I've had bad ones before, worse than what this seems, but those never made me feel as horrible as this one did. \n\nTL;DR: I couldn't find customer order, he says I'm treating him like a criminal while I'm apologizing and we both end up crying. \n",

        "text": "Let's be honest - in a dense urban environment, 100% legitimate parking is not always a thing.\n\nI do it all - driveways, fire hydrants, bus stops, resident-only parking. I'm gone in two minutes and it's difficult working for a small shop that only has, at most, 2 drivers working at any given time.\n\nSo I go this spot I've been many, many times before. No street parking for blocks in any direction. No worries, I'll pull into the white-curb loading zone, pop up the elevator and be gone like clockwork.\n\nCome down to see the pizza car hooked up to a tow truck. Time, being of the essence, and knowing a bit about towing regulations, I run over and get in the passenger seat (They can't tow it with you in it, but they *can* call the cops and the cops can make you get out)\n\nCall my boss, tell him what's up. Hashtag fuck my life.\n\nHe's willing to throw the hookup fee on the company credit card, wants to know how much.\n\nOne hundred and ninety seven fucking dollars.\n\nFor real.\n\nTow guy won't take a card number over the phone, and won't wait 10 minutes for the card to be delivered to me.\n\nGive him my card. Cha-ching.\n\n$197. Even though it sucks, though, it's not the companies fault (and please don't argue with me about this, this is a matter of ethical integrity, not one of the law. I'm well aware that I could lay this on the company. I choose not to because personal responsibility is important to me)\n\nHere's the hilarious part though: While I was hooked up and going through the motions, some other guy pulled up behind me, parked, and goes into the building. I did not notice this at the time as I was quite preoccupied with my own TIFU.\n\nEnter tow truck #2, who pulls up and starts hooking that guys car up.\n\nI say to my tow truck guy \"Hey, did that guy seriously come and park right behind us while our thing was going on?\"\n\nAnd he's like yeah.\n\nI couldn't help it. It was too hilarious. I busted up laughing. Like here I am being towed for parking here and you pull up and park behind me like... the fuck are you thinking?!\n\nSo then they other guy comes out of the building and he sees it all going down with tow truck #2. He's running over there saying he's sorry, I'm sorry, so sorry! like that's going to get him out of it.\n\nAll I could yell after him was \"You're screwed, man! A hundred and ninety seven dollars!\"\n\nBright side, delivery times weren't fucked because we weren't very busy, and they didn't actually tow and impound the company car (Think more like $600 if we went and got it right away - fuck that)\n\nThe lesson of the story is this: You can park in wonky spots all the time for quite a while before the stars align to fuck you right in your unwilling sphincter. But eventually it will happen.",

When he arrived, he had some trouble finding the right apartment and he was driving around trying to illuminate the numbers with his head lights.\n\nHe eventually found the right apartment and delivered the food.\n\nAs he was leaving the complex, he noticed three men in black, with what looked like masks on, standing about 150 feet up the road out in front of him. He slowly approached when he noticed one with a handgun, out in the road trying to flag him down. He proceeded to peel out. Leaving an impressive strip of rubber. As he sped toward them, he swerved to avoid them, but saw a flash and heard a loud report.\n\nA rifle bullet had penetrated his radiator. Coolant and steam were shooting out from under the hood as he raced away from the scene. The car made it back to the store before it took its final breaths, bled out and succumbed to its injuries. It was pronouced dead shortly before midnight. The ambulance (tow truck) came to take the  corpse to the morgue (junkyard) shortly thereafter as the body temperature cooled.\n\nOf course, the GM notified the police immediately. The driver was a little shaken up. \n\nSo the police come to the store. One comes in while two others are scoping the car out and seem to be really excited about something? They're on the radio and their cell phones.\n\nThe officers tell the driver they are waiting for their Sargent. You could tell something was up, because they didn't want to know much detail about the incident. The only thing they asked was, where did this happen? The questions ended there.\n\nThe Sargent arrives.  He looks over the deceased,  and comes in. It's then they inform the driver they know who did the shooting!  It wasn't members of the Crips, but officers from their own department who were doing an undercover drug sting on a Heroin dealer. The driver's car matched the car of the guy they were looking for. They thought the driver was trying to run them over when he floored the gas. The one who opened fire had put a .223 slug from his AR-15 rifle through the front of driver's chariot!\n\nThe guy was out of work a few weeks, but the payout from the police department's insurance was well worth it for him! \n\nHe was pretty damn lucky. If the bullet had been placed a few inches higher and to the right, it would have gone right through the windshield into the delivery driver's dome. \n\nYou always expect the delivery driver to be the one shot and killed on a delivery. They say delivery is statistically one of the most dangerous jobs in the USA? It's not often your hear about the delivery driver's car itself being the victim of a violent crime.",

        "text": "Hey guys. Fellow pizza guy here. \nI was wondering, would anybody else be interested if I posted a blank spreadsheet with equations and rules for figuring out how much you made each day? Usually it comes in handy for knowing how much to give to the boss man at the end of the night (it's always better to double check your numbers)\n\nThe spreadsheet can work with either Excel or Numbers. \nI usually fill it out on the fly every work day (on mobile of course)\nWith a small bit of adjustment, it can be configured for those who receive a delivery fee and those who don't. In the math of the equations in the spreadsheet, you can replace my delivery fee ($1.75) with your own. \n\nIt works by just plugging in your tip (without delivery fee) into a column. A count on the column keeps track of your total tips. Another row keeps track of your fee (number of deliveries x 1.75). Another row keeps track of your tips AND fee put together (your total tip gross). There is then a box to input the number of hours you worked, which then calculates how much you made in hours ($h) (again, you can change the amount in the spreadsheet for how much $ per hour. Mine is set to 3)\n\nThere are also rows for number of deliveries (number of tips input into the column) and the amount of money recieved for the hours you worked. \n\nThe last row is necessary because then there is another row for ($ for hours worked + $ from tips). This is your grand total what you made.\nOther random rows for data: $ from fee, and deliveries per hour. \n\nAnd lastly, most importantly, there is a row which is the total $ netted/hours worked gives you ($/hour), so from there you can know if you're having a good or a bad night at any point throughout your shift. \n\nI use the app to see how much I made as well, but also I know that everything else left over after the final number belongs to the boss. Also, not pictured, but the very bottom row I have (tips/# of deliveries). So it's as if every person gave you this amount. (4.85 X 20 deliveries)\n\nHere is a link with last night for example so you guys can see how it works. Hopefully some of you delivery folk will want to use it too.

It was just a typical Friday night. Pretty busy but not incredibly so. As the main guys were slapping dough and prepping some of the food orders, I ended up getting a call.\n\n\nNow the order went off without a hitch. I got everything down and verified everything with the customer before giving her the total. That's when things went down hill. M-Me. CL-Card Lady.\n\nM: Will you be paying by cash or card today?\n\nCL: I'll Pay by card.\n\nM: Okay now that I have the number can I get the security code on the back?\n\nCL: *tuts* Nuh-huh! I've never had to do that before! I've got you!\n\n\nTo note, she literally said this. Like I was somehow attempting to pull one over her so obviously. Besides, I knew that she was either lying or had ordered from a different joint before since we've always required the security code to complete card transactions. Even the online ordering requires it.\n\n\nM: Ma'am, I cannot complete the transaction without the code.\n\nCL: *incoherent mumbling*\n\nM: Ma'am?\n\nCL: I'll just order from somewhere else.\n\nSo there we have it. Some lady thought that I was blatantly attempting to steal her card number over the phone like that. The thing that bothered me the most was her tutting at me like I was some sort of toddler getting caught with their hand in the cookie jar. Anybody else had this happen to them? =/\n\nEdit: Spacing.",

        "text": "Sometimes on my way home from work, I'll order a carryout and stop by a local place to pick it up like you would. Usually though because of my work schedule I'm stopping by like 30 minutes before the store closes. Working in a fast food place I now how annoying it is to get orders right before close and feel kinda bad doing it to them. I realize its less work then sending a driver on a delivery, but can't shake the feeling. Am I being too nice and considerate?",

        "text": "One night before the opening manager left at a store I was covering a shift at, I decided to take a couple deliveries to help out the service times. We were in da hood. I took a delivery to 52nd and Girard. A guy answered the door. He was very pleasant. He gave me a $7 tip which is extremely rare in that area. \n\nI headed back to the store (less than a 5 minute drive) and the opening manager left the second I walked in leaving me in charge for the night. Minutes later I got a call from a chick saying that her driver flipped her off, flipped her pizza over, and called her a cheap ass whore. Lovely. I asked for her address so I could identify the driver. She said she wanted her money back including tip. \n\n\"Ma'am. Can i have a description of the driver and car? \"\n\n\"She was a black bitch with a green car.\" \n\n\"I'm sorry Ma'am, I can't assist you until you decide to start telling the truth.\"\n\nShe lost it until I told her I was the driver, and I'm white. Click. Her man came to the store later and apologized saying his girl got jealous once she realized how much of a tip I got. He didn't realize I was the manager so gave her the wrong description of me so anyone would know she was lying.",
