Or at least I though I had.\n\nThe other day, I stopped by a newly opened middle-eastern store and bought a bag of couscous, and didn't think much of it until I went to serve it for dinner tonight.\n\nThen I started reading the directions . . .\n\nRinsing, spreading, sifting, sitting, steaming, cooling, spreading, steaming again (I think?). Since I was out of time for the guests, I took a step back and made some pasta with butter and parmigian.\n\nBefore I try this again, I have a few questions . . .\n\n* Recipes I've found suggest steaming it with flavored broth. Is this actually effective? Getting flavor into the couscous with this method would seem to require vaporizing the flavoring, then having it magically condense in the couscous. I suspect all I'd be doing is making expensive flavorless steam and leaving concentrated broth in the bottom of the pot.\n\n* Is all the sifting and spreading and heating and cooling and steaming actually needed, or if I knew how much liquid it needed, couldn't I just toss it all in a pot or rice cooker?\n\n* If steaming is actually necessary, is the whole process hugely easier with a couscousiere, or is a pot with a strainer cover it just as good?\n\n* Is \"real\" couscous worth the effort when compared to the instant couscous in the box?\n\n\n\n**EDIT**\n\nI want to thank everybody for their help.\n\nWhile the bag makes a big deal out of steaming and fluffing and spreading and soaking and whatever else they were talking about,  it was perfectly acceptable when I brought some chicken stock to a simmer, added the couscous and simmered another ~10 minutes.\n\nI'm sure it would have been nicer and fluffier if I went through the whole process, this was just fine.\n\nI used 2:1 liquid to fine couscous",

        "text": "I read some old threads and tried to find some overlap with this question but couldn't. We do *not* pasteurize our eggs before making the mayo. Eggs are one or two days old, at most. Mayo gets stored in the same (very clean) mason jar that it was emulsified in. We do not cross-contaminate with dirty utensils. All ingredients are fresh. We know that both lemon and salt have preservative properties but ... the eggs are never cooked or heated in any way. \n\nMy wife and I want to know ... *How long is this stuff good for?* \n\nOur first batch only lasted a week (single batch) before we ate it all. We could not detect any change in flavor either and mayo appeared fresh, did not have any \"crusty\" rim from evaporation, no \"splitting\" or anything that looked or smelled strange. Yesterday we made a double batch, and used 1/3 in some macaroni salad. I am trying to figure out how long it will taste fresh and be safe to consume. Also, we want to use this info to decide *if* making homemade mayo exclusively (once a week or every two weeks) can prevent us from ever having to buy plastic tubs of Hellmans again. Both of us vastly prefer homemade to store-bought but (as easy as it is to make) we usually end up with more than we need for a given recipe. So, how long does it last, approximately, given these variables. \n\nThanks, /u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt! Thanks, /r/seriouseats ",

I forgot to add the salt while heating the milk on the stovetop. \n\nThe curd and whey separated much earlier (~130 F) than when I've made it previously, and when we went to strain the curd in the cheesecloth it was already almost dry. As I went to mix in lemon zest the curd broke down into very tiny crumbles--completely different from before. \n\nWhile trying to figure out what the hell went wrong I remembered the salt. We added 1/2 teaspoon and within seconds the mixture was creamier. Add in a little more whey and it achieved the desired texture. \n\nCan someone explain the mechanism behind this? And if this cuts down on draining time why do we add the salt when heating? Why not add salt (and return some whey) after it's curdled to better control the texture?",

I've made italian sausage and mexican chorizo before (separate occasions), but with all the meat I have, I'm wanting to make a number of different types in one go. My question is, does the pork need to sit with all seasonings overnight before grinding, or just the proper salt ratio? If I can put all of the pork in a single large bowl or tray and let it sit overnight, I have room in the fridge, but if it does need to be separated and sit with all seasonings overnight, I probably don't have enough room in the fridge for all of the different vessels.",

The final result is not unlike a green smoothie -- delicious even to the vegetally challenged. \n\nThe recipe is also really adaptable. I've made it with a bunch of different cheeses. I've made it with Kenji's suggested bread crumb crust, a homemade pie crust, a homemade whole wheat pie crust, and this time a frozen pie crust. (We have a 10-month-old; don't judge.) I've made it with the suggested half and half, but I've also had good results using milk -- just bump it down to a cup of milk and up the eggs to five or six. \n\nAnyway, I don't often see this recipe on the lists of Kenji's Greatest Hits, but it's fast and flexible and always delicious. My family and I have eaten it more times than anything else he's created. You should try it out!",

In my opinion, there was no noticeable difference, and yes... maybe I ate chicken wings for breakfast. Don't judge me.

        "text": "Kenji's blue label burger blend and other SE recipes came up recently in the sub, but I wanted to post a review with some tips as we kickoff cookout season.  \n\nFor [reference](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2009/10/the-blue-label-burger-blend-recipe.html) Kenji did post a suggested burger blend if you are into grinding your own meats (and you should).  If you have a stand mixer, the grinder is definitely one of those \"don't think about it, just buy it\" attachments.  You cannot reproduce the texture of freshly ground meat any other way even if it looks similar sitting in the bowl.  The blend is essentially 6 parts sirloin to 5 parts brisket and 5 parts oxtail (which is the interesting part).  I can concur with others on this sub.....it tastes amazing.  Definitely go with the Martin's rolls!\n\nHere's a few tips:\n\nCall around about the oxtail. I was surprised which shops around me had it vs. didn't have it on hand and I had to make a few stops.  Its also definitely not as inexpensive as it used to be.  \n\n7 out of the 8 packages I ended up with had a strong odor when defrosted and opened.  At first I thought it had gone bad, but it was all frozen solid and within the dates on the packaging.  After some reading around, it sounded like a strong odor is not uncommon with bone-in beef products.  It also smelled more like dry-aged beef than rotten meat.  I confirmed no mold or discoloration and put a trimmed piece in a pot of water.  As soon as it came to temp the odor went away and yielded a deep beef/game flavor.  I decided to proceed.\n\nAgain I'll concur with others that trimming oxtail is a real pain, even with sharp knives.  On the outside it looks like just a disk of meat with bone in the center, but the bone segments are more vertebrae-shaped and you cannot trim straight down.  You have to follow the bone's shape and I found that simply cutting around the spurs in a pie-shaped pattern gave the most productive trimming.  You will still end up with bones that seem to have quite a bit of tissue left on them, but its best to just bag and freeze them for stock instead of trying to get every shred off.  Aggressive trimming with razor sharp knives ended up giving me some bone shavings that thankfully my patty making assistant found before going to the grill.  A food scale is very helpful for keeping servings consistent and we were right on target with yield.  A 5.3/5.5 oz patty seemed to be the perfect size and cooked flat with a dimple in the center of one side.  \n\nI could have trimmed more fat off my meat, but I like a higher fat content for flavor (ask Kenji says, you aren't eating a burger because its your healthy food day).  But this blend definitely produces far more liquid fat than a typical lean patty.  Cooking directly over flame or coals produced near constant flare-ups that took away from the flavor.  I highly recommend using a cookie sheet or a couple of large cast iron skillets to keep the melted fat out of the fire.  I did that on one of my grills and some best burgers I've ever eaten came out of that grill.  \n\nI also whipped up some [quick pickles](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/09/quick-dill-pickle-chips-recipe.html) and I can't see ever buying pickles again.  Its incredibly fast and everyone was raving about the flavor.  I did note that they are have a bit of heat to them from the peppercorns and I didn't use the red pepper flakes.  It tastes great, but just be aware that the recipe will give you pickle chips with a slight burn.  Delicious though.  I'm not even much of a vinegar flavor guy but I was eating them out of the container while cleaning up.   Thicker slices of cucumber gave a bit more depth of flavor as the brine doesn't penetrate as far and gives some sweet cucumber to contrast with the brine, salt, and beefy burger.  Absolutely wonderful.   \n\nAll in all, great cookout and thanks again to Kenji and the other SE contributors for sharing their expertise.  ",

Or would it make more sense to brown it and put it in the oven for a while while I do the sauce? With my last attempt, it did turn out quite well, but I had a smaller loin. The sauce is very sticky and I was very close to ending up with a thick, near burnt mess in my pan, which I salvaged mostly be adding more liquid as I cooked it. With a much larger loin this time around, I can see it would be very easy to overcook the sauce. \n\nMaybe this is all pointless and I should simply cook my loin until just below my desired internal temp, then create the sauce, return my loin to the pan and bring it all together?\n\nAny suggestions appreciated!",

A few podcasts back Kenji was interviewed by Kimball in an interesting science Q&amp;A segment. While I enjoyed the segment, I thought it odd and was suprised they are working together. Well this week co-host Sarah Molton used the Food Lab as a reference to help a caller with their french fry technique, even mentioned Kenji by name as \"Your [Kimball's] old college.\" It makes me wonder - is Kimball just cashing in on the success of the Food Lab? Or am I being too cynical and these are they genuine tips from sources Molton/Kimball personally like? I don't care either way, I like both and it's fun to see them working together. While it seems SE is partnering with Milk Street, ATK is (or has) parterning with The Splendid Table and has since ended their own podcast. As grating as Kimball can sometimes be, I'm convinced he really was the life-force behind ATK since the PBS show now sucks and seems to be void of personality. #TeamKimball #TeamKenji",

We had much better luck the next day splitting each 'bun' into 1/3s along its laminations, folding in half, and then steaming. \n\nSteam for 8 minutes and enjoy. Made it with a pot of Chinese chicken soup (whole chicken broken down and simmered with Mirepoix, garlic, star anise, ginger, and cinnamon).

I try to support them as often as possible in every way (listen to podcast, view sponsor links in emails, enable ads on the website) but damn, when I load an SE tab in chrome, my laptop fan starts churning, the \"loading\" wheel continues to spin the whole time the site is open - no idea what's going on. Is this just me? On mobile, the site is often impossible to read as well due to redirects or crashes or other issues I attribute to ads. It's unfortunate and I wish they offered a premium model to eliminate all ads - I'd subscribe in a heartbeat. Anyway, end of my rant.\n\nedit: is this even meta? I don't know...",

We're working on revamping our veggie burgers at work, and I'd really love to use the original recipe as a base.\n\nThe kind of thing I have in mind, for example, would be swapping barley for quinoa, chickpeas for favas, or cashews/pine nuts for walnuts.\n",
