It’s responsibilities lie largely in the storage space and the back end is responsible for management of these devices.\n\nAnother engineer has been advocating for removing e2e testing (and replacing with contract testing) on the cloud side so that cloud development can speed up. This seems wrong to me. \n\n I have only ever experienced the more typical web app front end + cloud backend so only have that experience to draw on, so I am unsure of how to convince him that this is a potentially dangerous idea.

I have taken an introductory data science course this semester and find it interesting, which compelled me to want to transfer to the CS program here, but that is the extent of my programming knowledge. I have extensive research experience from high school in Materials Science &amp; Physics, and was actually the only high schooler in the U.S. to get into a pretty prestigious undergraduate research program at a public university near where I live. Basically, my resume is stacked with stellar activities relating to Materials Science, but I have nothing towards software engineering. Do y'all know of any good SWE internships that I could apply to that I would have a chance of getting into?",

Will this issue be solved by the observability tools or am I understanding it the wrong way.\n\nAny resource covering in-depth difference would be highly helpful, Thx.",

Idea behind it is:\n\n* to uncover the data/object flows\n* identify the anomalies in the data as it moves from one class/method to another(this will observe data for sometime to find all the possible combinations, it will raise an alert if there would be difference in data). \n*  uncovering which method takes the most time etc. \n* Flow visualization can also be used as a form of documentation of ever changing code base and understanding the undocumented part of the code. \n\nMoreover, I also plan to add a functionality of \"indexing\" the codebase allowing developers to search the logic/flows of their choice - for eg how the app behaves for user A (lets say a stripe) as compared to user B(appstore user) and output should be complete flow end to end.\n\nBefore working more on this, i wanted to get an earliest feedback to validate the top pain points developers have around this issue and what other tools are offering.",

However, unlike the patterns promulgated in the Dockerverse, Containers are built over a complete base system, with additional tools added interactively. It does not depend on an application-specific `Dockerfile`. Rather, it allows a user to configure a build environment normally, yet without changing the host, thus offering a hybrid between full container isolation and fully-local operations.\n\nAt the moment, communities beyond Fedora, such as Debian, Ubuntu, and so on, have not adopted it. There are no binaries or packages available for targets of these kinds.\n\nAre any alternatives available that might be more suitable for other host systems, for example, of Debian-based operating systems?",

        "text": "Do you have experience working with anyone who writes a lot of code, seemingly without any consideration for maintainability, flexibility, or reuse? I don't know how many times if looked back at systems I have carefully designed, only to find if statements hacked in to bypass normal functionality only because they didn't want to be bothered with trying to understand how it works. They just want to implement functionality quickly as they can.\n\nThese people seem to often be admired by management for having a reputation for getting things done, but they jeopardize the long term success of the project. The best analogy I can think of would be if a race car driver was admired for how fast he can drive, but he's constantly grinding gears and the transmission eventually siezes up. The people in charge don't know how to judge the quality of code, so they don't who is responsible for tanking productivity and grinding a project to a hault.\n\nIt becomes more frustrating when management wants to reuse functionality, and then you look to find that it is so tightly coupled to a specific use case that everything that had been done now needs to be ripped out and rewritten and management doesn't understand why it's so complicated. Often it seems that code is degrading faster than anyone can do anything about, and now there are so many convoluted special cases and branching mazes of inconsistent logic that nobody can even be begin to understand it. To avoid unintended side effects of changes, people just sprinkle in more if statements to alter the behavior of code in dozens of places.\n\nWhat can be done about this? There seems to be developments who think they are good at their jobs because of how much code they write, or because of how many years they have been doing it, but they never seemed to have learned anything about software architecture the entire time they have been working. I think this is a major problem in software development that you don't hear mentioned very often.\n\nWe do code reviews of pull requests, but often people mess with systems other teams are responsible for and then they don't wind up finding out about changes until weeks later. The people doing the reviews don't understand how it works, so often all anyone can do is a superficial check of the code for things like spelling errors or immediately apparent bugs. Because people are overwhelmed with their own work, they just wind up approving code changes they dont understand just to keep things moving.\n\nWhat can be done to reign in the chaos and get everyone on the same page with how things should be done? It's like if home contractors were building a house and they have a lot of people thinking things like, \"the plumbing is already installed in the kitchen, so the easiest thing to do would be to attach a hose to the sink and place the toilet on top of the counter.\" Then the entire house gets hacked together in that same sort of way -- with loose wires dangling all over the place, rooms that are inaccessible because the doors had been removed, boxes stacked upon boxes that would put a hoarder to shame, the roof leaks, and tenets constantly complain about fires spontaneously arising.\n\nIt's like watching a slow motion train wreck going over a waterfall.",
