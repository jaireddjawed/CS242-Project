        "text": "I [F, 25] have been in a relationship with this girl [F, 22]  for an year now and I don’t understand why she seems to have the emotional intelligence of a kid. She cannot communicate her feelings, she slams doors, gives me the silent treatment, yells at the smallest inconvenient. She cannot compromise when it comes to trivial things like watching a movie and will make a great deal out of it. Basically everything I say and do will turn into an argument. And what shocks me the most is that she never even acknowledges what she does wrong. She genuinely doesn’t know what made me mad or what hurt me. Therefore, she is never genuinely sorry, she just learned that she has to say “sorry” to avoid the “drama” after she fucks up. Sometimes she even rolls her eyes while apologizing as if I’m demanding something absurd. I tried to talk to her a million times and nothing changes.\n\nHow do you guys explain her behavior and what should I do? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR! I am feeling desperate because my partner keeps throwing tantrums like a kid and it feels exhausting.",

        "text": "So my boyfriend (27M) and I (23F) have been together for about 6 months and it's been great we have so much fun together especially since he's more extraverted and high energy brings me out of my shell and makes me do more things and helps me out of my comfort zone. \n\nBut it's about that time when the honeymoon phase is about to end and I have to say one thing has surprised me. He's always happy go lucky but out of nowhere he'll go quiet and only lighten up once I give him a little speech about how much I love him and care about him etc... Just out of nowhere, no fight, no trigger that I know of. Like the other day he was all quiet I'm presuming because I didn't really acknowledge him when I came home because I had a shit ton of work to do and he only perked up when I hugged him and gave him a little comforting speech. \n\nIt's very foreign to me since I was with someone for two years who was very much like me in the sense that he and I were very calm and collected and were able to speak about things calmly and introspectively, whereas my current boyfriend gets more heated and will say things in the spur of the moment that he'll later apoligize for which is something I don't really like since my dad is like this and u always told myself I would never end up with someone like that (love my dad though just something I found annoying lol). \n\nBut even though it's annoying to me I can't help but see a little boy when I look into his eyes that just needs me to tell him that everything's fine. My point is, is this something that will be constant? Is it just a phase since we're entering serious territory? Is this the sign of something deeper from his upbringing that he hasn't mentioned? And how do I deal with it? I want to be prepared so that I can diffuse any doubts he has and comfort him as much as possible but I don't know how. \n\nI really care about him and I want to understand and help him get over whatever this is.\n\nTldr: my boyfriend frequently gets upset if I'm not vocal about how much I care for him. Is this normal/how do I deal with it?",

        "text": "I just found out that my wife cheated on me 6 years ago and I don’t know how to process it. \n\nMy wife gave birth a month ago and she’s been dealing with quite severe postpartum depression. She’s been weepy and very anxious. I think the postpartum hormones and emotions have brought up feelings of guilt from the past. \n\nYesterday she told me that 6 years ago, early in our engagement, she cheated on me. The cheating consisted of her flirting with guys over text and over calls. She sexted once or twice but said she never sent any photos of herself. She had met these men online. She never did anything with them in person. This went on over the course of a month but she said it wasn’t a daily occurrence. She said she did it about 6-8 times over a month. We were long distance at this point and she was in college. \n\nWhen she told me this, she was crying and begging me not to leave her. She said she felt a tremendous amount of guilt afterwards and vowed to never do it again. She told me that she vowed to dedicate the rest of her life to being the perfect partner. \n\nShe is an amazing woman. We have the perfect marriage and a beautiful baby girl. She goes above and beyond to make me happy. I know she was young and made stupid choices and she’s changed a lot since so I forgive her. I also know I’m the only person she’s ever had sex with so that also makes it easier to forgive her. \n\nHowever, although I forgive her, I’m still very hurt by finding this out. It was a shock to me. I didn’t expect someone who is so nice and innocent to do something like that. I never picked her as the unfaithful type I guess. I’ve been giving her the silent treatment because I honestly need time and space to process all this. How do we move forward as a couple? \n\ntl;dr: wife cheated 6 years ago before we were married. She just told me. How do I put this behind me?",

        "text": "I recently moved back to my hometown to take over my fathers company, after spending my twenties working long hours and never taking a relationship seriously. Almost immediately after arriving I got set up on a date with a friend of a family acquaintance. We hit it off immediately, it was like when someone says they knew on the first date they’d met their soul mate. For the three months since, our relationship has been incredible. We said I love you very quickly and very happy whenever I’m with her. \n\nThe issue I’m having is that in those three months, our relationship has advanced in extremely quickly. After four dates I met her whole family, and we see her parents at least every couple of weeks, and it’s the same sort of pace with her friends and colleagues. It’s been a lot, I’m managing to balance this socialization demand with work for the moment, but I’m going to talk to her about meeting more people in my life and not taking my somewhat flexible schedule for granted. \n\nThe reason I wrote this though, is because of something that happened a couple days ago. She came clean about how she had a long relationship, most of her 20’s, it ended very badly and they were trying for a baby when it did. She’s the youngest and her siblings have been done having more kids for a couple years, and she made it clear she wants her kids to be close in age to their cousins and to have time with her 70yo parents. This culminated with her telling me before we met she was ready to do IVF with donor sperm, and that she now wants kids with me and to be pregnant within 18 months. \n\nI played it cool when this happened, maybe she was testing me to some degree, but I know she’s serious. I want to be with her and see where this goes, but I’m afraid and I don’t want to hurt her, or waste her time. I do want kids, maybe it never occurred to me it would happen like this. Thank you for reading, any thought are appreciated.\n\nTLDR: new girlfriend wants kids with me asap, and she’s moving the relationship as fast as possible to get there",

He also talked about wanting me to be his girlfriend etc, and having me stay with him whenever I go to his location.\n\nI also have a lot of insecurities. After we had sex, he didn't text me as much as he did before we had sex. I became the nagging one after sex. I got very insecure about that. I also wondered if I had sex with him too soon and he just sees me as an easy lay. Plus, he was a DJ, worked late, and didn't call me after I changed my trip schedule to stay after we both agreed on resetting our \"relationship\" and go out on dates. So I freaked out and went to his place and banged on the door like 7am in the morning and loosened his door chain\n\nI didn't know why I did that, i had this intense feeling that he was with someone else. it felt like it was an out of body experience.\n\nI asked if he still want me over text. he just said angrily in the text that he needs time. I begged and begged, and apologized so profusely. I asked if he doesn't want me anymore, he would just block me. And the fact that he hasn't blocked me, it means he needs time? He doesn't say anything. Just said he needs time and told me to stop begging.\n\nBtw, he is still online dating apps talking to other girls.\n\nIt's been a week now since the door banging incident, and 4 days since I stopped begging and no contact.\n\nShould I send him a message again, apologize again and tell him that the pain I am feeling made me determined to change my ways. And I will never ever do it again. Basically asking him if he's made up his mind about whether wanting to see me again.\n\nBtw, I lent him $1000 to fix his bike.\n\nTL;DR : he asked for time, should I reach out again asking for certainty",

I usually spend my weekends with him, I started spending more time with him because he was making me feel as If I was going out without telling him and that was not the case. He told me that he believes that once that you are in a relationship you should stop partying too heavy out of respect of the relationship. I have no interested in going to a lot of parties, we are both 27 and I think I'm past that phase.\n\nWhat worries me have been 2 events that happened in these 2 weeks. \n\n2 weekends ago, my gay friend invited me to a weekend trip with his boyfriend. I declined the invitation because they were returning on Monday and I had to work. When I told my boyfriend about this, he got very upset, he told me that it was weird that he invited me and that I should try to understand his position and his feelings. Now, he gets suspicious if I listen to a voice message of this gay friend.\n\nThis last Saturday, I was at his house and we were having lunch when he received a call from his dad telling him that a relative (not a close one) had died, he told me that he needed to be with his family for a while. He also explained to me that it was something a little personal and he was going just to comfort his cousin. I told him that I understood and that I would call an Uber take me to my house since I don't have my car right now. He was fine with that, then I told him that I was probably going to visit my neighbor (a women) who was having some activity. He got a little upset. I told him \"why should I stay at home if we don't have plans anymore?\" he seemed to understand but then he convinced me to wait for him at his apartment, he was very pushy, he told me that he would be there only for 2 hours, he put me a movie, made a meal for me and I agreed to wait for him. \n\nI have a really soft spot for him and I don't want to fight with him but I am wondering if this is how my life is going to be. I am not an outgoing person and I do like to be with him but I am also trying to balance this and other things that are important for me.\n\nTL;DR : My boyfriend doesn't like when I go out and I am not sure If is too bad or I am overreacting.",

Im not anti weed but again choosing to do it together now and then I said would be fine and fun but he is sneaking it all the time and in front of the kids this way + he bought it at work from the guy im sure he seeing (husband is bi) found texts on hubs phone from guy asking how many “flowers” he wants to buy and then this much younger coworker called him “baby boyyy”\nMy husband lies now almost every time he talks (caught him in a few) so when he says oh the guy meant it in some “hip hop cool guy way-not sexy” I don’t believe it.\n\nTl; dr!

        "text": "So my guy friend (30M) and I (26F) have been friends for a little more than a year. To be clear, I am interested in him and things have always been slightly flirty between us and we hang out frequently, but we've never actually discussed feelings for each other or anything like that. Aside from this flirty/bantery undercurrent it's always been 100% platonic - we've always stated clearly how we're friends and even if we do datelike things alone together we're just \"hanging out.\"\n\nHowever in the past couple weeks he's seemed to be dropping some obvious hints or at least acting way more like a boyfriend. Just in the past 2 weeks, he's come over and brought me chocolates when I was having a bad day, baked me cookies just because, and yesterday he invited me to lunch and ice skating (just the two of us). He also paid for both, and even though we've done similar activities in the past we've always split the bill. He also seemed a bit more touchy/flirty (more eye contact, leaning in, \"accidental touches\") than usual and yesterday he also casually mentioned a song he's been liking and the lyrics of the chorus are literally \"I don't wanna be just friends\" lol. But when we were saying goodbye we just acted like this wasn't a date and just a normal friend hangout.\n\nIs he waiting for me to make a move? Or should I just see how it plays out? Thus far I've been responsive to his flirting but not really escalating it, if that makes sense just because his change in behavior seems to be kind of sudden, and I don't wanna make things weird on the off chance I'm reading it wrong. We're also both shy people and have both been single the entire time we've been friends, so it's not like he's recently broken up or anything like that.\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: Guy friend suddenly dropping hints/acting like a boyfriend after being friends for more than a year, yet not asking me out. Not sure if he wants me to make a move or if I should let it play out just in case I'm reading it wrong.",

Then we started work in another city together and stayed in different areas for about 18 months. We met multiple times over the week and did most things together. It was a simple time, we had fun. \n\nShe then moved to another country to pursue her second degree. I always supported her in whatever ways I could but I had always maintained that I don't see myself settling in another country, due to personal beliefs and family reasons. \n\nThrough the years of long distance, there were times we came close to give up but somehow stayed on. We couldn't really figure out a long term plan and it was obviously taking a toll on thr relationship. Caring gets harder with distance. You grow apart and then fall back close again. There are weird cycles.\n\nWe lived through the pandemic and met a few times but for small durations which didn't really move the meter on the bigger picture. So that brings us to the 3 week concluded trip.\n\nWe discussed our plans and options at hand but kept falling short. It felt like the only way to make it work would be to me shift there and it just doesn't add up sensibly in my head. I don't want our relationship to crumble under the weight of sacrifices. I always thought she would eventually come back to her base, that's where most of her important family is there as well.\n\nAnyway so we had fun over the 3 week period. It was the first significant time we spent together after a long time and it made us open up. We had so much fun. Living together was like we had no worries. Another testament to us not able to function and care for each other in the long distance. Both parties saw why the other person isn't able to take the leap of faith and it just felt like our careers are moving in very different directions and it's hard to see it merge for atleast the next 5-8 years.\n\nThe long flight back home sucked, I cried multiple times. Wrote notes for her and sent them over. Had bouts of guilts where I questioned if I'm myself very rigid and if that's the reason why we aren't landing together. But in other bouts it felt like I was under pressure all the time and it would have felt good to see her take some steps as well.\n\nRight now, it's been a day since I'm back and I miss her alot. I kept questioning myself and having thoughts of just shutting shop and moving to her. But somewhere I know one person can't take all the sacrifices, it's not healthy. We're still talking, getting used to the idea that we're broken up and I would just want to somehow magically end up together and go back to the simpler times of the early years.\n\n**TL;DR** - After failing to land in the same country after about five years of long distance, we just spent three weeks together agreeing that it isn't working out and decided to end things at the age of 29",

        "text": "\ntl;dr : The relationship with my (ex)boyfriend has been exhausting me over the past two years, so I decided to break up for my own mental health. However I struggle to stay strong and not get back to him. How do I stay strong ? \n\nI (25f) have been in a mostly long distance relationship with my ex-boyfriend(28M) for two years now. We would visit each others every 3 months for 1 month in average. \nWe have got our ups and downs, but over the past year, the relationship has been very hard to maintain due to constant arguments, communication issues, lack of affection, intimacy and well, efforts. \n\nHe can be very lovely when he wants to. Also what I admire the most is his transparency and how smart he is. How sometimes, he can put his ego aside during an argument, or how he can show support when he decides to. \nI know he is a trustworthy person overall, and I fell for his atypical personality. \n\nHowever, it’s been a while that I feel like I get to experience only the worst of him. He is so distant, cold and doesn’t think much about the words he uses to communicate with me. This lead me to feel unloved and hurt on a regular basis and ruins my energy.\nI brought it up to him many times. Trying to open the conversation. He would only say that he loves me and that I should trust his words. \nHowever, hearing this only upsets me because it lacks coherence. His actions and behaviors don’t add up to him stating he loves me. And basically, we reached a point where he would show emotions/affection/support only if he sees me distancing myself. And I’m so, so drained of this game. \n\nI started working 2 years ago and I’m a very career oriented person. Yet, I chose to stay up very late to be in touch with him, show him presence, play games with him even though I’m dead inside from my day of work. \nI might want to precise that he doesn’t work and don’t plan to (he earns a monthly income from renting, but it doesn’t allow him to save money) - he spends his days playing games and watching videos. \nFor this simple fact, everyone around me always advised me to stop wasting my time with “such a man” which I found an awful judgment, because I know too well this man is far more than his career. \nI have no issue with the fact the he doesn’t work by itself. In fact, he does house chores, cooks and so on without me having to tell him, which is extremely valuable in a man.\nHowever, I’ve figured out that him not working makes that he doesn’t realise how exhausting it is for me. And that I don’t want to play games with him, or watch his sport when I’m back home. I believe it made him build some kind of resentment as my priority changed at some point, from pleasing him to take care of my mental health. Since that switch in our routine, it has been so hard to cultivate a connection. He tells me bluntly that he is not interested in watching my shows/playing my games. However I’ve been doing it for him since the beginning. This also started to build up resentment for him on my side. \n\nWe had entered some vicious circle of coldness and distance. \nFunnily, he broke up with me some months ago, a week before my birthday, with a 16 points list explaining why I didn’t fit him. \nMore than the break-up itself, those broke my heart like I didn’t think it was even possible. \n\nI was so overwhelmed, lost and exhausted that I was just going to give up without a word. As shitty as I was feeling, I still had this part of me who wanted to keep trying something. I just told him I’d like to visit him for the end of the year celebrations if he was ok with it. \nSurprisingly he accepted. Those weeks went ok, and he ended up telling me he loved me and never wished to leave me, he just felt too drained as well. He even cried, which broke my heart twice more. I came there knowing this will probably be our last meeting. I ended up leaving his place, telling him that I needed more time to think things through. \n\nNot long after being back to distance relationship, the coldness vicious circle entered the picture again. But this time it was too much. I was also going through some big changes at work, I just couldn’t deal with all of that. I had some inner wish that he’d do a little something for Valentine’s to show me his love but nothing happened. Not long after I told him it was over. That night, he turned on his cam, which he didn’t do in the last 1,5 year even when I needed it. It was very painful, but at the end of the day I was proud I was able to put an end to this mess. I feel like I tried my best, compromised, accepted, but I ended up almost burning out. \nAlso that night, he told me that for him, we were far from being in what he considers a serious relationship (he was committed, but he didn’t see a future). We had had talks about the futur, about what we wanted, or not. We were more or less aligned, and this is what made me push through this energy-draining relationship everyday. But he was in his own bubble, and never saw further than…. that. He never realized the weight he had on the choices of my life. Or rather he never cared. I feel so much resentment towards him today. \nSince the separation, he keeps talking to me, every other day. Basically he has no one, he is all alone. So I feel too bad to let him all by himself, and being honest, I still love him in all that shitty mess, so remaining in contact isn’t so bad. It makes me feel very bad but less than if I were to disappear. \n\nI’m so sorry for the huge text, I think I just needed to vent. It’s been a month and I can’t get over it. I love him, but our relationship dynamic and his motivation/behaviour makes me believe that I’m just not enough. I feel like shit, and sometimes I just feel like apologising and going back together. It’s so hard to stay strong and walk away from a loved one, even more while remaining in touch with him. I’m afraid that I will regret it, because he is such a unique person. I’m so lost. \n\n\nThanks for reading until the end.",

        "text": "I had a rebound relationship 2 weeks after a break up for appx 2 weeks. But after realizing that I still loved my ex, I went back to her. However, I felt guilty for sleeping with the rebound and told my ex (current gf) that I had slept with someone. She was mad and felt betrayed.\n\n(Rightfully so since we still did talk during the break up and expected to meet during the summer after a 4-year LDR. But I acted the way I did since she broke up with me for the 3rd time and this time I didn't think we could have a future).\n\nSo, she asked me to tell everything what happened. I didn't want to lose her and so I lied to her that I didn't go on dates with the other girl, and that although we slept, I came out and went back home in just a few minutes. She believes what I said and understanding it as a one-night stand, isn't thinking about the issue anymore.\n\nBut I just feel so guilty for telling The One I love a lie regarding someone whom I had slept with. What should I do? I don't want to hurt her or our relationship. It's just too precious. Is the right thing to do to confess my lies and tell her the truth? I'm in agony esp since she doesn't understand the concept of a rebound... to her, it would be an emotional affair that betrays love and trust.\n\nTL;DR: Lied about a rebound relationship. Portrayed it as a 5 min one night stand with a friend. I'm afraid of telling the truth for what it may cause. But not telling it is also awful since she is The One and I don't want to live a complex life with such a lie.",

        "text": "We only knew each other for about 2 months, but they were the most passionate 2 months Ive ever felt with anyone. Ive had a girlfriend of 6 years, other short term gfs, one night stands to friends with benefits, and none of them ever made me feel like this girl did.\n\nLong story short, we split because she had kids, we lived an hour away, she was in the middle of a big move and also making a career switch, so she had tons to deal with - she also said she's been in relationships for most of her adult life, and wanted to be able to grow on her own and with her kids. Totally reasonable in the end. She kind of took me on an emotional rollercoaster, but now that the grieving stage is over.. I get it.\n\nIn either case, she told me she loved me so much, would miss me forever and would regret losing me, but that it was ultimately for the best. We talked one final night saying how much we meant, and at the end she blocked my number saying it was for both of us so we didn't have to keep hurting each other.\n\nNow that I can think more clearly about things, I just want to tell her one final set of thoughts, basically just telling her I understand, forgive her, and that if the time ever comes when she feels ready to be committed with someone again, she can try to reach out and not be afraid. Im not upset, or angry. I just miss her.\n\nI dont know how to say this though without seeming like a creep since my number is blocked, but its eating me alive that I cant let it out. It feels like the one final thing I need to do for myself to let her go, get closure for myself, and finally start moving on. I want to handwrite a note and leave it on her car at work but I dont know if that would be considered creepy..? Or if I should even say these things at all and just let it go. Im really conflicted because we split for reasons outside of how much we loved each other, and right up to the very last things we said to each other were saying exactly that. I just want her to know its ok and that she can feel comfortable if she ever wanted to talk again.\n\nAt first I just wrote it out for myself with the intent of sending it to her number which she'd never see - but after writing it I realized these are things I really want her to know. Something like this:\n\n\" I guess you’ll never see this if you blocked me but I wanted to say I read through all of our texts one last time before I get rid of them, and wanted to get off my chest the last few things I should have the other night before I delete them for myself.\n\nI really loved the idea that we seemed so compatible - we had so many things in common from food and music, to hobbies and interests, backgrounds, and life goals of having a loving family with people we cared about. I was high on the thought I found someone I could go to a country music concert with, stop for hot wings on the way home, do corny stuff like play super smash together, and end the night in bed with someone I’ve never been more compatible with in that too.\n\nEven if I only knew you for a few weeks, I thought the world of that future we could’ve had and it haunts me that we never got the chance to see if we could have those perfect nights. Besides that I fell for little things I never even noticed in other people, like your voice, the feel of your hands in my hair and mine in yours, your cute nose; the way your hugs just melted into mine.\n\nIf you do see this, you don’t need to answer it, but you should know that if you do find yourself grown out of whatever phase you’re in and feel like you are ready to have a real committed shot with someone who cares about you, you can always try to reach out. I need to do some more growing myself and work on how to handle things better too. I don’t know when that will be or if I’d even be available then, but try. Maybe that future is still there and we just met at the wrong time.\n\nUntil then this is the goodbye rant I needed to write for myself so I can stop reading these texts and looking at your pictures and making myself miss you. So goodbye xxx, I hope one day we meet again under better timing and circumstance. I really do. \"\n\nWhat are your guys' thoughts?  \n\n\nTl;dr: Ex and I split because she had a lot going on and couldnt handle a relationship; blocked me to resist the urge to talk to me but I want to let her know its ok to if she ever feels comfortable to try again",

        "text": "We have been dating for 8 months.\n\nMy girlfriend was talking about how she wanted to climb Mount Kilimanjaro to which I said same, I mentioned it’s about 1600 metres taller than the mountain I climbed. She asked me how long it took for me to climb the mountain I said a day and a half to this she said that’s not right I said no it did she then said nope how’s that possible if Kilimanjaro is only 1600 metres taller and it takes 5-9 days to climb. I explained to her it gets really tough after around 3800m because that’s when you feel the affects of altitude she then said nope you must be thinking of something else or you did something else because that doesn’t make sense. I said no it takes a day and a half and was about to go into detail about my climb but she just said no you are definitely thinking of something else.\n\nAt this point I was taken aback and just didn’t say anything as everything I said was shut down she also didn’t say anything I then said shall we talk later and she said sure and we hung up.\nAfter around an hour of expecting her to apologise I thought I’d message her saying what she did upset me she didn’t see this for an hour and then rang me when she did. I asked her if she thought she did anything wrong to which she didn’t respond I then told her why I felt upset and she said you should’ve told me you were going to tell me a story making it seem like my fault but every time I tried to say something she would just say nope you must be thinking of something else. \n\nEven after telling her what she did to hurt me she didn’t say anything, it just seemed like it didn’t bother her. All I heard was the occasional yawn I then said you aren’t talking to me so there’s not much point in this call so I’ll hang up, I told her I was still upset and that the ball is in her court as to whether she wants to speak to me. She since turned her phone on airplane mode and I’m assuming has gone to sleep.\n\nI honestly feel like shit and that my feelings don’t matter to her, this has happened on quite a few occasions where she will upset me then either get upset at my reaction meaning I eventually apologise or just not apologise and I move on with it and take it on the chin\n\nI really don’t know how to explain how hard this behaviour is for me to deal with and it makes me scared to say things and just bottle them up.\n\nTL:DR\nMy girlfriend upset me by persisting my timings for climbing a mountain weren’t possible and not listening to my reasoning and saying I must’ve done something different when it’s 100% how long it took. She then just went on with her day like she didn’t do anything wrong and upon telling her what she did hurt my feelings and why she ignored me on call and didn’t apologise. It has made me feel like my feelings don’t matter to her and I just just remain stoic no matter what",

        "text": "I'm (F40) newly married to my husband (M37). We've been married for 4 months now and were together for just shy of a year prior to our wedding. I know it probably sounds strange that we married so quickly yet had not had sex, but my husband is a devout Christian and believes that sex outside of marriage is a sin. While I am a Christian, I have never been as devout as he is and never felt the need to wait until marriage for sex. We did have sex the night of our wedding, but that has been the only time. Frankly, it was not great, but I expected that it may be a bit awkward due to my husband's inexperience. I have no problem with the idea of building up to great sex together. I do have a problem with not having sex at all, but every time I try to get things going, my husband brushes me off. When we were dating, the not-having-sex-thing took some getting used to, but I discovered that I really loved building intimacy without it. I've never felt so loved and cherished by anyone as I do my husband. He is a kind and wonderful man who treats me like a queen, but the fact that we have still not had sex is leaving me questioning everything. I'll be honest, there are two main reasons why we married so soon after we began our relationship: we both want children and we both wanted to have sex (or so I believed). As for the first reason, I'm quickly approaching perimenopause, and well, the clock is ticking. As for the second, I LOVE sex and miss it greatly. I don't know what to do, Reddit. I'm too embarrassed to go to my friends and family for advice. I feel so naive for thinking that this would all work out, but I honestly believed that the worst case scenario would be that we might not be immediately compatible as lovers. I never imagined that I would have a sexless marriage. As I said before, this situation has me doubting our relationship. I've found myself wondering whether my husband may be a closeted gay man or asexual. I've been hanging onto hope that because he's been a virgin for so long, he doesn't feel comfortable with sex yet. Maybe I should have done more that first night to put him at ease. What do I do?\n\nTLDR: My new husband and I have only had sex once, and I don't know what to do or think.",

Yesterday I took my wife's cell phone to get her credit card details and found 2 photos of an explicitly naked man in the gallery of photos received (no face, just body and genitals). I saved the pictures and printscreens but now I don't know what to do. Not sure, but almost certainly he is her boss (by skin color and body). He is a friend of our family, he was at my youngest daughter's birthday. Conversations with him were empty (I believe they were erased).\n\nI feel extremely ashamed and humiliated.

The good times were so good and I don’t know how I could ever meet such a perfect girl ever again. The world threw me an Angel and I messed it all up. I feel so worthless, my entire life I’ve been a spoiled brat without any consequences for my actions. Now my world is crumbling down and it’s all my fault. I love her more than anything in the world and I want to win her back to damn badly but I really think she’s given up. I basically just needed somewhere to vent. I’m sorry for everything Jaycie, you deserved so much more from me.

She wouldn't go out her way to help people and asking questions to get to know each other her response has always been always fully self centered and narcissistic.\n\nRecently although she still nags and criticises me she's a lot happier it seems.\n\nShe cheated on me with a fwb when we first made it official. she's helped guys rub oil on their backs in the sauna, I made it clear I'm not OK with that and she seemed to understand, although she stopped doing it only because of me... Not because it's an odd thing for a partner to do. \n\nAnyway that's the background tonight she was at a event tonight and just text late at night to say that she helped drop off a guy at his house as their bike was broken after the event. We have location sharing on our phones and it makes me wonder if this is why she told me? \n\nFor a normal healthy relationship it wouldn't be much probably but if you know her this is highly out of her character, it's not like her to do this and go out of her way for someone else and Im not even sure who this person is, if it's a stranger it's more alarm bells, I have small dread inside me that it had maybe more to this sudden effort to help someone out of nowhere?\n\nWe just booked a holiday, and I know it will sound like I'm untrusting and paranoid but logical she thinks different and wouldn't put the two together.\n\nHelp me understand why someone would go out there way to help someone else that they don't know when every other time they would not?\n\nTldr: GF acted differently and helped a stranger of the opposite sex late at night with bike trouble when in every other scenario they would not help.

She’s my first girlfriend and first sexual partner I’ve ever had.  I never really put forth much effort into dating because of poor self-esteem.  But I consider myself a much improved person. \n\nHowever, we’ve recently hit sort of a rough patch. One of her friends is getting married in November and has invited us. I don’t really care for weddings so I wasn’t too excited to begin with. Then I learned that two of my girlfriend’s old hookups will be there.  Now I’m really sold on the idea of not going.\n\nHere’s where I may be the asshole, I understand that this is a big occasion but I don’t want to be in the same room as two guys she used to fuck.\n\nI’ve tried my best to explain to my girlfriend that being in the same room as two guys she used to casually hook up with and have meaningless sex with is not an ideal situation for me to be in.  However, she has stated that I am overreacting, being irrational and making a bigger deal of this than it really is.  \n\nI’ve told her that she can’t really see my side of things and where I’m coming from because she can’t see things for my perspective.  I told her to imagine if I was the only guy she had ever been intimate with and she had to be in the same room with women I used to hook up with.  She claims she wouldn’t care. I don’t really believe her.\n\nWe haven’t really gotten along since. The wedding is set for November and my decision is final, as I have decided isn’t best for me not to go to avoid any awkward situations.\n\nTL;DR - I decided not to go to a wedding because guys my girlfriend used to fuck will be there.",

Thank you in advance, and this is a throwaway account.\n\n\nThe issue on my side started about 2 years ago, but its lengthy so if anyone needs it to give any insight I’ll share.\n\n\nThe jist of it is, I(F27) have been a committed relationship (M30) for almost 6 years. 2 years ago a coworker started showing interest in me, and I was excited. I never let anything happen, but he was aggressive about it. I thankfully left that department soon after he tried to pull anything.\n\n\nI thought I was in the clear, and had learned my lesson. After I moved departments I have worked with my crew for a little over a year now, and its happening again. My coworker showing me interest, hasn’t tried anything more than holding my hand.\n\n\nI know after all this, from an outside perspective, that I am a untrustworthy person. I just don’t understand why I am happy when I am shown this attention, and why I can’t just be happy with what I have.\n\n\nI know this sounds like shit, but I’ve just been struggling with it for a while. There is a lot more to the story, and I want to defend, and make excuses for myself, but I need to stop pretending that this is a one sided thing.\n\n\nTL;DR: Girl is getting attention and liking it from coworkers, even though she is in a 6 year relationship.",

I told him its fairly new so only time will tell.

After that text i was left on read and he has been ignoring me! I have asked many of guys that before but i never got like no answer at all. Like now i feel bad. Is that too instructive of a question to ask a friend? I genuinely wanted to know because i am interested in him but I didn’t expect that reaction. Was i wrong? Or is he just afraid to tell me something??\n\nTl;dr should i just completely back away now",

        "text": "I met her during my frehsman year of college after having a class together and we have been best friends since then. I always had a crush on her, but I was genuinely friends with her at the same time. Her family wasn't too fond of her being friends with me because her father was very judgemental (he's White and didn't want his daughter hanging around Latinos + I am Latino).\n\nNot only that, her father is very judgmental towards people like me becauss not only my race. But also because I have a lot of tattoos around my body. Long story short. There was a huge fire due to a gas leak in their house. I was over at her place and I was going home , but she called me back panicked because there was a fire.\n\nShe amd the rest of her family got out but her dad was stuck in their house and she and her mother couldn't go back so I had turned back around. I took a lot of physical pain to help her father because I went in and helped her father out through a window. I got burns all over my body and I had some very bad cuts that left nasty scars when I broke the window. I was able to recover, but the scars still hurt and it was the worst thing I had ever physically gone through.\n\nAfter that incident, her dad completely chamged his attitude about me and now he likes me. We get together I'd say daily to have a coffee in the morning, or to grab some lunch. Not only that, we started traveling together and he treats me like a son now and he told me that he would very much want me as his son in law and he said he'd like a guy like me for his daughter.\n\nNow, I have respected my best friends boundaries after she rejected me like a year back. She said she wasn't ready to start dating seriously, but she texted me and asked if I could go on a date with her. She planned a whole weekend away for us and this is what I've wanted with her. The thing is I don't know if it's genuine because she only asked me out after the incident with her dad. \n\nI don't want her to feel like she owes me anything because she doesn't and I want her to be with me because of genuine interest, not because I helped save her father. I don't know whether or not I should even bring this conversation up to her because I don't want to look or be disrespectful. So what do you guys think I should do regarding the date and how I could see if she's in it for just me and not because of me helping her?\n\nTLDR: Best friend rejected me a while back and said she wasn't ready to start dating. We stayed friends and I helped save her dad's life after their hohse caught on fire and he was stuck in there. She asked me out after that incident, but I don't want her to feel like she owes me anything.",

        "text": "Without going into an unreasonable amount of detail, my (M20) girlfriend (F19) of nearly three years has become very manipulative and disrespectful since she has come to college (a year after me). A past post of mine where I was trying to decide if I was just being unrealistic got an overwhelming number of “dump her” “break up with her” “you deserve better” responses. She had a terrible family life and upbringing though, and one of the few things she says that I can fully believe is that I am her consistency and her rock. But I feel I’ve become her support structure, male support figure, bail out plan, and financial bail out person rather than a boyfriend. Basically what a parent or guardian should be, but she needs a good one of those more than she needs a BF. She has learned from her upbringing that lying and telling someone what they want to hear is a safer option than the truth, which really doesn’t work with me. She says she tries to fix it but it’s very cyclical and I’ve hung on for a year and a half of poor treatment (prioritizing others over me nearly always, never following through on promises, expecting me to always be available to help her but only ever wanting to do things on her schedule) and I think my friends and the folks of Reddit may be right.\n\nBut back to the consistent person/rock thing. She is in therapy, she had a horribly bad childhood and has very inconsistent parents even now, and she doesn’t do the things she should to make the therapy and meds work (stop drinking, sleep enough, pick supportive friends, and find some kind of consistency or routines in her life besides me always being on standby as her bail out). I feel horrible for her. But it’s really damaging my mental health and motivation and social life (since her safety blanket is knowing I’m there for her, so if I leave town or am tied up for a while, not okay) in the process.\n\nAnytime she senses any tension from my end in the relationship she gets super anxious and will nearly cry and start asking me if I’m breaking up with her and how she doesn’t know how she would make it without me. I seriously worry she would have no support and might do temporary or permanent damage to her self/body/life if I left. \n\nHow do I exit without ruining a life? I have lost all love or lust for her (her lust went away a while ago it seems) romantically. I care about her in a friend/family member way, but it’s hard to love someone who treats you this way, even if I fully understand why she does it based on her past. The college transition really is where everything turned downhill and she begs me to just let her have her college experience and fight through it, but this isn’t a typical college relationship, and I don’t know if I believe it will be as much better after college as she thinks. She believes without all the crazy college influences that she will be better. But she says without me she doesn’t think she can make it. Advice please and thank you.\n\nTl;dr How do I breakup with my emotionally struggling girlfriend in a way that doesn’t ruin her? I’ve held on as long as I can.",

I've asked if she would be willing to find a therapist but she shut the idea down saying that she's done it before and it didn't work. Also she cannot afford it right now as prices are around £80 per session. I've suggested that maybe she could rejoin a gym as she loves gyming and I read that exercise can really help with depression. She said that she's struggling to make herself meals let alone go exercise. She dismisses any ideas I have to help. We don't live together so I can't physically be there for her all the time.\n\nShe going through a very rough time and seeing her go through this pains me so much.

Also, saving money on my income which is pretty low after taxes.\n\nAnd we’re on the same page in terms of lifestyle and life goals.\n\nAdditionally, he’s willing to relocate to my area since I have just gotten the first job that’s working out for me—state employment with good benefits.\n\nCons: I’ve felt stifled living with other people up to this point, I have not yet had a place to myself, and am concerned about needing space. Currently I live with my mother, who in short is a difficult, stressful person. I don’t want escaping this environment to be a reason I move in with him.\n\nAlso I wonder if the way I feel toward him is normal for a relationship. We’re very very affectionate emotionally and physically, in ways I never want to be with anyone else. He’s the dearest person in my life. But I’ve never been on the “honeymoon high” about him although it’s happened with previous people I had feelings for. And to my understanding, the honeymoon phase is not sustainable. But I’m still not sure if I should have felt this way at some point.\n\nIf I had my way, we would buy a duplex and be close together while having our own space, but that’s not financially an option right now.\n\nInput is appreciated!!\n\nTL;DR- boyfriend wants to live together but I’m unsure about giving up personal space.",

        "text": "TLDR: boyfriend (23m) brought up concerns last night (Numbered below) now I’m (23f) just confused on if our relationship is healthy/if this is normal. We’ve dated a little over half year.\n\nWe have been dating less than a year, have tons of mutual friends and everything seemed to be going great …until recently. I am in grad school I’m constantly studying and when I’m not studying I try to make plans with friends or my boyfriend (he knows grad school is time consuming). My boyfriend works two jobs and didn’t finish college. So he works a lot to be financially secure. Which means when I’m free he’s typically at work or vice versa. We hang out a lot just catching up, watching a few shows and then ultimately just going to bed because we are tired from our schedules. \n\nProblem starts: \nThe last few weekends I made plans with my friends for Saturday. I’ve made these plans weeks before. Every time I see him after these plans I feel like he’s upset with me. He makes comments like how he feels like he’s not invited after we have a girls only dinner and then invite him to the bars but it’s already so late (wasn’t invited previously because we didn’t know we’d go out other bfs are there/show up ). Also, he is invited to things but has work so he can’t go. Like my friends and I went to an event he was invited but couldn’t go because work which bummer but I’m not upset because i understand work. After event we go to dinner and invite him, he has tight budget and said no he will meet us later which he did. I thought everything was going well. Then we get back to his and he lays out a ton of issues and was very emotional and drunk:\n\n1. He says it’s not my fault but he feels inadequate he can’t provide for me. Which I find kind or insulting as I take pride in being financially dependent from a man. I also don’t understand what he means by provide. We are young and dating not married. And I said he provides enough emotional support, providing just isn’t money but he seems to not get that. And it worries me it’s a point of contention because after grad school I will likely be the breadwinner, which I have zero problem with as long as my s/o isn’t bumming off me/making me feel used (I don’t see how the difference from a man financially providing for a woman in marriage, to a woman financially providing for a man. Unless there’s some unspoken thing I don’t know about that men expect? Like i know they expect free childcare sometimes but that’s not the point and not what I’m getting at) \n\n2. That he feels like “we don’t have quality time together”. He has “put ZERO effort in planning actual activities”, I said that to him and he said he doesn’t have money. Which upsets me as I feel like that’s an excuse: I’m more than happy to go on a walk or visit a free museum or have a picnic or even a planned movie night. He then says due to his past he can’t plan because he’s been gaslight about plans before. Which frustrates me an stresses me into making all the plans. So he wants planned quality time but can’t plan it. \n-we do, do dates and stuff but I usually plan it. \n-I ask him to go on walks or walk around town and it’s usually he’s too tired or blows it off. \n\n3. He’s making me guilty for hanging out with friends. I’m starting to feel like he wants me to wait around till he’s off work to see if he wants to do something because he can’t plan. I’m a very social person with little time, I value my friendships if i Can plan to see my friends I will the once a week I see them. He mentioned he is jealous my friends can spend time with me more which i see them once a week for activity we plan in advance . Also said I chose them over him\n\n4. I got us tickets to a concert because I wanted to go and I know he loves an artist. I was excited and thought this would be a great memory for us. But 5 times he’s brought up these tickets and that he feels bad I got them for us because they were expensive and he can’t do the same. I got them because I thought it’s was an activity we both could enjoy but now I’m dreading the concert and I kind of don’t wanna go because I feel like I shouldn’t of got the tickets, I was just excited. I’m debating if I should sell them if they’re such a sore subject. Or letting him take a friend instead of me ( even tho i want to go i just feel guilty). I would feel bad selling them because he was excited about them I’m just confused.  \n\n5. Valentine’s Day I got excited and prepped him a cute basket. He made bfast at mine (like usual) with what I had and brought me flowers. He said he got me something and it wasn’t in yet, which okay i understand. Then he says i can pick out nice sunglasses which i wasn’t too keen about as they were expensive. He hasn’t brought it up so i haven’t as I do not want to force him to get me nice gift. He mentions last night how he’s sad he can’t get me nice gift . Which I I don’t need honestly i preferred a nice heart felt card but didn’t even get that. Like literally anything sentimental I would’ve been happy with. He says it’s money but then he can spend money drinking at bar which he doesn’t do a lot but I’m like the price of one beer is enough for a card. (Haven’t mentioned to him this bothered me)\n\n\nI sort of mentioned the above to him (besides vday) when he brought this up yesterday and all he says is I’m not doing anything wrong it’s just how he feels. Which leaves me confused. Like I’m glad he can share his feelings and be emotional but i feel like he’s blaming me and. I just feel guilty. I don’t know what to think. \n\nAny advice?",

        "text": "TLDR: When communicating, who's responsibility is it to make sure information is conveyed and received the correct way? The person talking or the person listening?\n\nMe (42F) and my husband (44M) get into arguments sometimes and I immediately react when I feel he's being condescending and judgy.  I feel/sense it in the way he talks and acts.  He swears up and down he's not being condescending, and part of my believes him, but I can't make my reaction not immediately be wanting to throat punch him when I feel he's acting \"superior.\"\nPart of my reaction is likely do to some \"PTSD\" from past REALLY HORRIBLE arguments.  Nothing abusive or anything, just being felt like I wasnt being heard and him not making any sense in his arguments because he was likely drunk, also lots of yelling.  So, I'm wondering is it on me to just know he's not being condescending/judgy/critical or is it on him to try to convey what he's saying better?",

When I talk to him about the modern women doesn’t like nice/successful men he doesn’t understand. He blamed it on me and say I need to change who I go up to. I told him most men don’t wanna date ugly girls. He says he doesn’t date ugly girls, I told him “I hate to break it you but your gf ugly bro”. He got mad and left , now I’m blocked on everything even though we been friends since high school. \n\n\nShould I contact a mutual friend to have him facilitate a discussion so I can apologize?

I can’t get a read on him- I feel like we’re just friends, but then he does something like this and it confuses me. We’ve been friends for a couple years and are part of the same friend group. Any time I need help with something- he’s there to help. But he doesn’t initiate conversations often, it’s usually me who initiates. \n\nIs this just a friend being solid (and I’m just looking for something I want to see) OR is this a guy friend who is maybe looking for something more?\n\nTD;LR- guy “friend” made me cookies- could this be more than friends?",
