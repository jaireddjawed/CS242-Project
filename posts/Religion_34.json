First there's satanist, which is rare but a thing (and I presume it doesn't refer to the athiest church of satan), and then there's Cthulu Cultist. What on earth? Just a \"cultist\" (nobody involved in a cult would label themselves as such outside of straight-up memes) who believes in a *fictional character* created just over a hundred years ago by a mentally ill man who wrote disturbing stories to vent his morbid feelings. I have never met somebody who would describe themselves as a \"Cthulu Cultist,\" in fact a number of these are absurd and borderline memes.",

        "text": "Before you read this, no I’m not talking about all atheists and trying to label them as such. I’m talking about my own experience.\n\nBackground: \nI grew up Christian, became an anti-theist for a while until I was introduced to paganism. After that I bounced around pagan spheres for a while, sometimes exploring Christianity through a new lens. I never had any sort of spiritual experiences other than some coincidences happening when I was using Tarot to talk to Tyr, and also when I gave an offering to Astarte I became way more confident and flirty. Which those are things one can easily write off. More recently though I had what seemed to be a more “real” experience. Some people say it was an out of body experience due to the warm buzzing I felt and some of the things I saw. But I’m to this day unsure. But I know it wasn’t a normal thing to happen to me, spiritual or not.\n\nGiven all this info, I’m now an atheist. Regardless of the religious experience I had that I still can’t explain. And now I’m worried that I may just be trying to run and hide from religion as it may have gotten too real and confusing for me. I don’t really know what to do in this situation. Also I should add I’m in therapy and he tried to give me religious answers like “you believe in whatever you want to” (which I found absurd) but the other thing is it did feel like he was pushing atheism onto me as he suggested I read “The God Delusion” and a book by Cristopher Hitchens so that may have affected my mental state a little.",

But regardless Im not here to promote my YT channel. \n\nHowever if Moses was fiction and alot of the Jewish based their prophecy's around Moses, even going as far to say \"The messiah would be the best prophet 2nd to Moses\" Yet Moses himself never existed then are those prophecy's just technically fiction? By that definition Jesus cant be the messiah because the prophecy's of the messiah was based around a fictional story and some of the biblical figures said the Jesus was Moses reincarnated. But Moses didnt exist... Yet the storys did.. but the figure didnt at least not to the extent of whats described in Genesis or Exodus. \n\nThere is also no documented evidence of Abraham existing either or the figure but yet the reason the three major Abrahamic religions are based around the idea of Abraham being the first prophet..   \nBut Abraham didnt exist.. Does that mean there still Abrahamic if Abraham is fictional? \n\nAny answers would be great! Thanks!",

Putting together the actual time the books where wrote by comparing them to the current historical event documented and if the character in the book actually existed.  You would be surprised to know a majority of these people dont actually exist at least no record of them exists. There is only vague documents and evidence that paint some light to some of the characters existing but they are not these superheros that the storys paints them as. \n\nKing David is the best example of this. There is proof he might have been a king at some point but there is little to no proof of the event in \"The book of Samuel\" of David and the Goliath. Its still debated if the story happened or not but they believe it was massively over exaggerated like the book of \"genesis\" or \"Joshua\". \n\nNow how does Moses come into this?   \nThe book of Genesis was not the first book wrote like its in the OT. The book was wrote around the year 600 - 500 BCE ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book\\_of\\_Genesis#:\\~:text=Tradition%20credits%20Moses%20as%20the,is%20supposed%20to%20have%20lived](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis#:~:text=Tradition%20credits%20Moses%20as%20the,is%20supposed%20to%20have%20lived).)  \nthe first book to have actually been wrote was the book of Leviticus which came in 700 - 601 BCE. \n\nThis is backed by the Levynite's who were around during this time who had names very similar names to Egyptian names but they themselves were not Egyptian. It was believed the leader of the Levynites was a man names Levi who also went my Moses.",

They claim that this leaves no room for spiritual concepts like God, spirits or souls. \n\nI am Hindu. I believe in one God with many aspects. I believe in reincarnation and humans and all of nature having a spirit inside. Does this really contradict with physics?

Oh yeah, maybe like EVERY religion in the world. \n\nAnd yet teaching will always dismiss their beliefs instantly as fake and mythological and not accept these beliefs as actual religions.\n\nBeing that us human beings have no way of understanding what truly lies after death, or who/what orchestrates the universe, ALL religions are mythology by that very logic.\n\nAt least, personally, the way I view it, as that religion is just taking the concept of spirituality and adding their own little fabricated stories to it, no different than \"mythology.\" Although I do believe in a spiritual side to our world, I'm not religious, yet still very fascinated by religion, because it is after all culture and there's also many great life lessons to be learned from all religions.\n\nI know this is a strange rant, but when I get a random idea, I have to share it with reddit.\n\nAlso question: Is there still a large community of people who follow \"mythology\" today?\n\nAnother question: What religion prevails in today's Rome and Greece? And to any natives out there, what is your countries current day view on mythology?\n\nThanks for reading, have a nice day:)",

Coz of the most important job of a elected politician is to protect the public, no matter how low the chance is.\nI RESPECT all religions, I'm just stating facts and possibilities.\n\nREASONS:\n\n1) Islam, most of them are loving and religious people and only few of them become extremist, but that \"few\" still a very alarming threat for the safety of public, the chance is still big.\n2) Hindu, they are also loving people and religious but they could hurt or even kill someone not Hindu just because they caught them slaying cow(to become beef). Beef industry is good for economy.\n3) Disrespectful religions, for example they turned the hero(e.g. George Washington) into god.\n4) Cults - those who teach self-harm because they believed the power is with them, all in one vote policy, etc.\n\nPROPOSALS:\n\nI don't want to ban any religions if they can PREVENT what i worry about. They are your religion members, then they are your responsibility first, they become like that because what your religion teached them but I'll just see it as is they misinterpreted something thats why they become like that.\nSo I will propose a discussion among their best religious leaders, for example;\n1A) for Muslims, how can we prevent a person to become an extremist? Education is not enough, because there also few terrorist who joined royal army, engineers, etc. I'm asking using your religion, tats the only way after all. If its possible change their mind, then I will build a islamic government agency that rehabs the Muslims with extremist mentality.\n2A) For Hindus, since cow is sacred animal for them then how will the members react when they mix with people that eat beef infront of them? Will they also attack the beef companies? And will they just hurt them or kill them? Coz i heard killings too just because of this. \n3~4) Ban them without discussion and arrest the leaders.

        "text": "Wondering about what people think about the purpose of miracles. Let's just assume that all the miracles claimed in one's religion were correct. In this case, what is the purpose of those miracles? I can see a few logical options but would be interested to know what I'm missing.\n\nI think commonly it's viewed as some type of evidence for one's religion. But everyone's religion has \"verifiable\" miracles, so that's not a good comparison. It's just a game of miracle comparison. Whose miracle is best, verifiable, or what have you. But I don't know of much spreading of a faith like that by any of the founders of the world's religions. Seems like not a solid argument for the value of miracles.\n\nI'm not even sure it's useful for proving to the person who viewed the miracle. How does one distinguish between fraud and true miracle. Many \"miracle\" workers have existed through the ages and still to this day. At *best* it seems like only the really strong miracles, like reconstituting someone from a decomposed body who had died months ago, like something that would be impossible to fake, at best these ones could convince a small-ish cohort of people who actually saw it. \n\nWho assuming miracles do exist and are right, how are they useful?\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Much like the Baha'is and Latter-Day Saints, I believe in perpetual revelation from \"God\", \"The Universe\", \"Oneness\", etc. While as of the present time I'm not of a particular persuasion with regards to faith, I do find truth in all beliefs. I don't follow or believe in the validity of the \"Abrahamic God\"; but it seems to me that many events/beliefs that occurred or were inspired by Biblical and Quranic accounts have their specific elements of truth and significance to the \"Ever Unfolding Revelation\". \nIt doesn't seem to me that God only sporadically raises \"prophets/prophetesses\" or reveals knowledge/truths every so often. This is why conventional ideas about \"Revelation\" are, in my personal opinion, insufficient. The entity we call \"God\" is always communicating with us and giving us revelation - not only a \"few of us\" or at \"special times\". \nRevelation is also not confined to \"religious\" doctrines or scriptures. It is found within scientific exploration and discovery as well. Now, does this imply that the marvels of science and technology should be exclusively attributed to God? No, of course not; but the point is to show that we all receive revelation. We receive it as we grow and develop in life, as we carry out our everyday existence. Many times we simply forget to consider the potential nuances of the lessons we learn and the experience we gain. \nAll in all, this ultimately to only encourage an unconventional thought or brief analysis on \"Revelation\". I will leave you with just one question: \n\n\"What instances in your life might be considered 'revelations'?\" \n\nI think it's important to ask this as we may oftentimes find a treasure trove of previously hidded knowledge and answers to unresolved questions. I believe - if there is a conscious and caring force beyond the material world - that it would care enough to always communicate with us at all times. This is not a technically \"new\" idea; but it is one that I think we fail to effectively revive.",

(In less cryptic terms for those unitiated to my peculiar writing style, my only claim to being Jewish is my strong identification with being a person whose ancestors were Jews, for whom that erstwhile-tentative identification is ethically binding in ways transcending my one lifetime as yours truly‘s self.)\n\nSecond, let me state that it is not merely my understanding, but my ethically binding commitment to tell you, that Jews invented the forerunner concept to our contemporary form of God, who today is a civic God for the public defense against all Otherness. But my ancestors, the ancient Jews, were extremely sensitive and inquisitive human beings. When writing was categorically more risky of an endeavor than it is today, my ancestors wrote scriptures and wove entire edifices of ideas around the apparently miraculous nature of the sheer fact of communication among fellows, across time and distance, of a discourse permitting intense depths of cultural self-examination, and a cultural methodology of securing the textual artifacts of that discourse’s reproduction within the safe confines of a scripture industry called by such names as Pentateuch, Torah, Kaballah, and others no doubt that I never have learned.\n\nBut the core of all this industry and cultural sacrifice, of all these lifetimes sanctioned and trained to carry out energy-intensive scriptural writings, early, fascinatingly profound examinations—indeed, emanations—of the technologies found through the written word: the core of Judaism is a timeless secret, that God is the nameless namer, whose name is That I Am I Am. (Please accept my surrender to the self-proclaimed heterodoxy of this perspective; it is only mine and anyone else’s who likes it.)\n\nMy ancestral people learned to write to live and preserve thereby the knowledge of sacred possibilities, like the Shabbat, a whole day-cycle of material labor sacrificed—divine-mandated work stoppage!—so that holiness might be honored at home and with host of souls. (Thank Jews for the two-day weekend, soon undoubtedly to be three.) Held in the only-up-to-me confines of my cryptic, only-in-my-genes Judaic soul, I am trying to learn to feel guiltless for knowing how, and yet, for spurning those moneymaking trades that shackle customers in rhetorical penitentiaries as a matter of a specific-to-this-one-writing, not-\"really\"-Jewish, definitely-not-Christian faith. It is my blessing from powers neither mine nor yours that life cause such contingencies as to give rise to my telling you in such forms as I am using.\n\nGod, That I Am I Am, and may I add, That Thou Art Thou Art, is that one who guarantees that there will be peace on the other side of the sentence that God is used in.\n\nGod is a hidden library of peace that my ancestors founded, as a literary, religious, and ideological institution.\n\nAnd the Kabbalistic, Rabbinical, and Orthodox knowledges of why and how they and we became these people who we are, this is what makes Jews and their allies such as myself targets of autocratic usurpers such as ethno-state fascists. Nazis targeted Jews for many reasons. I am not a historian, though I desire more knowledge in this area. But it is strongly persuasive to me to consider that among these reasons, why, for example, Hitler didn’t more strongly emphasize the Roma people than the Jews, both historically marginalized trans-European peoples whom his regime killed in his obscene, disgusting rhetoric—that among the reasons that the Jews drew particular ire from that hate machine is that Jews represented a culture within Germany and within other states’ territories which maintained a strongly resilient, indeed, resplendent intellectual and literary tradition of historical scholarship tethered to ethnic and religious commitments to ethical exegeses of the truth, in written words.\n\nMy apologies for the repeat and slight revisions of my original reply somewhere buried below; it is with earnest faith in God that I make it so.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/zbl34y/the_adam_and_eve_story/",
        "text": "I’m curious as to everyone’s beliefs about Adam and Eve. Do you think they were real? If so what do you think happened? How do you feel about “original sin?” How do you feel about “the fall?”.\n\nFor those not of abrahamic religions, do you have an origin point religiously of the origin of humanity?\n\n.\n\nTo get us started, I’ll share what my church says\n\nTldr: we see Adam and Eve as literally created in gods image. the fall of Adam and Eve wasn’t a horrible thing. Rather is was necessary for our progression and advancement. “Downward and forward”. Likewise we believe no one will be held accountable or be punished for Adam and eves transgression, this being fully covered by Christ.\n\n.\n\nLong version: \n\nOverview\n\nIn the Garden of Eden, God commanded, “Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die” (Moses 3:16–17). Because Adam and Eve transgressed this command and partook of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they were cast out from the presence of the Lord (see Doctrine and Covenants 29:40–41). In other words, they experienced spiritual death. They also became mortal﻿—subject to physical death. This spiritual and physical death is called the Fall.\n\nOur Fallen Condition\n\nAs descendants of Adam and Eve, we inherit a fallen condition during mortality (see Alma 42:5–9, 14). We are separated from the presence of the Lord and subject to physical death. We are also placed in a state of opposition, in which we are tested by the difficulties of life and the temptations of the adversary (see 2 Nephi 2:11–14; Doctrine and Covenants 29:39; Moses 6:48–49).\n\nIn this fallen condition, we have a conflict within us. We are spirit children of God, with the potential to be “partakers of the divine nature” (2 Peter 1:4). However, “we are unworthy before [God]; because of the fall our natures have become evil continually” (Ether 3:2). We need to strive continually to overcome unrighteous passions and desires.\n\nRepeating the words of an angel, King Benjamin said, “The natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam.” King Benjamin warned that in this natural, or fallen, state, each person will be an enemy to God forever “unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father” (Mosiah 3:19).\n\nBenefits of the Fall\n\nThe Fall is an integral part of Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation (see 2 Nephi 2:15–16; 9:6). It has a twofold direction—downward yet forward. In addition to introducing physical and spiritual death, it gave us the opportunity to be born on the earth and to learn and progress. Through our righteous exercise of agency and our sincere repentance when we sin, we can come unto Christ and, through His Atonement, prepare to receive the gift of eternal life. The prophet Lehi taught:\n\n“If Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end.\n\n“And [Adam and Eve] would have had no children; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin.\n\n“But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things.\n\n“Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.\n\n“And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall” (2 Nephi 2:22–26; see also 2 Nephi 2:19–21, 27).\n\nAdam and Eve expressed their gratitude for the blessings that came as a result of the Fall:\n\n“Adam blessed God and was filled, and began to prophesy concerning all the families of the earth, saying: Blessed be the name of God, for because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God.\n\n“And Eve, his wife, heard all these things and was glad, saying: Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient” (Moses 5:10–11).\n\nRedemption from the Fall\n\nBecause of our fallen, mortal nature and our individual sins, our only hope is in Jesus Christ and the plan of redemption.\n\nThrough the Atonement of Jesus Christ, everyone will be redeemed from the effects of the Fall. We will be resurrected, and we will be brought back into the presence of the Lord to be judged (see 2 Nephi 2:5–10; Alma 11:42–45; Helaman 14:15–17).\n\nIn addition to redeeming us from the universal effects of the Fall, the Savior can redeem us from our own sins. In our fallen state, we sin and distance ourselves from the Lord, bringing spiritual death upon ourselves. As the Apostle Paul said, “All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). If we remain in our sins, we cannot dwell in the presence of God, for “no unclean thing can dwell … in his presence” (Moses 6:57). Thankfully, the Atonement “bringeth to pass the condition of repentance” (Helaman 14:18), making it possible for us to receive forgiveness for our sins and dwell in the presence of God forever. Alma taught, “There was a space granted unto man in which he might repent; therefore this life became a probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God; a time to prepare for that endless state which has been spoken of by us, which is after the resurrection of the dead” (Alma 12:24).\n\nGratitude for the Savior’s Atoning Sacrifice\nJust as we do not really desire food until we are hungry, we will not fully desire eternal salvation until we recognize our need for the Savior. This recognition comes as we grow in our understanding of the Fall. As the prophet Lehi taught, “All mankind were in a lost and in a fallen state, and ever would be save they should rely on this Redeemer” (1 Nephi 10:6).\n\n.\n\nOriginal sin:\n\nOverview\n\nBecause of the Fall of Adam and Eve, all people live in a fallen condition, separated from God and subject to physical death. However, we are not condemned by what many call the “original sin.” In other words, we are not accountable for Adam’s transgression in the Garden of Eden. The Prophet Joseph Smith said, “We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam’s transgression” (Articles of Faith 1:2).\n\nThrough the Atonement, the Savior paid the price for the transgression in the Garden of Eden (see Moses 6:53). He has given us the assurance of resurrection and the promise that, based on our faithfulness, we can return to dwell in the presence of our Heavenly Father forever.",

        "author": "starfield_pro",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/zb7ydn/christianity_is_pelagian/",
        "text": "As a more specific follow up to an earlier post, I'd like to discuss something about Christianity. I believe its Pelagian nature is undeniable and fundamental. It's not really Christianity without it. Even Origen made it essential.\n\nThe failure of Pelagianism within Roman orthodoxy is not a matter of apostolic orthodoxy, but rather the needs of the imperial state, using the works of rhetorician (liar) Augustine of Hippo.\n\nPelagianism does something almost no religion does, it highlights why Christianity is unique, and it answer almost any schismatic controversy within Christianity.\n\nAt worst, semi-Pelagianism, which fits within Augustine's original sin doctrine, incorporates the free will teaching. Even Mormons have this sorted out when they argue Christ absolved the original sin of Adam universally, but not the individual sin of each individual human, which is Pelagian.\n\nHowever, the \"Pelagian\" doctrine is simple, and like I said, unique. Here is Origen:\n\n&gt;Unless the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain who build it. Unless the Lord guards the city, the watchman stays awake in vain\" (Ps. 126 \\[127\\]:1). This is not meant to deter us from building, or to counsel us not to be vigilant in guarding the city which is in our soul... We should do right in calling a building a work of God, rather than of the builder, and the preservation of a city from hostile attack we should rightly call an achievement of God rather than of the guard. But in so speaking we assume man's share in the achievement, while in thankfulness we ascribe it to God who brings it to success.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Similarly man's will is not sufficient to obtain the end (of salvation) (Rom. 9:16), nor is the running of the metaphorical athletes competent to attain \"the prize of the upward summons of God in Christ Jesus\" (Phil. 3:14). This is only accomplished with God's assistance. Thus it is quite true, \"It is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy\" (Rom. 9:16). Our perfection does not come about by our remaining inactive, yet it is not accomplished by our own activity; God plays the great part in effecting it.\n\nPelagianism says humans must be good and have a power to be good. Roman orthodoxy says this denies the need for Christ's salvation. That's nonsense.\n\nThe concept is very simple. God only holds man accountable for sin in proportion to man's awareness of his own sin and his natural ability to resist it. Man is saved by grace through faith, but per James, faith without works is dead. Likewise, Christ himself says He will judge according to our works.\n\nThe harmonization is completely simple and consistent with Origen. Some portion of the \"work\" of moral accountability and goodness is left to us by God. Christ will judge us according to that portion alone, which is the proof of our faith. We rely on grace, but cannot do so inactively.\n\nIt's so simple. Even Origen was completely aware of it. Augustine's position was, effectively, a heresy of Christianity. It's simply that by 400 AD, Constantinople had taken political control of the church and it no longer served God, but rather the state. So those doctrines persisted through history. In Britain and the West overall, Pelagian ideas and impulses remained strong. The modern world is heavily influenced by them in spite of Augustine.\n\nWhat makes Pelagian Christianity unique, and therefore what's unique about Christianity, is that it creates a spiritual reason for the lowly, poor and outsiders to have a right to their own voice and their own agency. No other religion so systematically provided for this.\n\nChristianity in this way is also one of the few religions of the ancient and even modern worlds to focus on personal rather than collective accountability. That's rare in human history.\n\nSo, Christianity should be seen as Pelagian, and in this light it is unique and special.",

        "text": "In the 80s and 90s, and even early 2000s, we had the Satanist Panic in America, but I think it was not much worse than the Communist Panic, Nazi Panic, Anthrax Panic, Atomic Panic (during Cold War), etc. Today we also have our share of panics, some of them justifiable and reasonable, such as Climate Change, COVID-19 and Neo-Nazi Panic, and the Russia/China Panic, although these panics do not seem as prominent as in the past, but I may be wrong.\n\nPersonally I did not find the \"Satanic Panic\" worse than the \"Cult Panic\" or other panics we had on the issue of religion and supernaturalism, but I understand that America is big and I guess some parts had different manifestations of the phenomena.\n\nIt seems America love these waves of Panics, often caused by Hollywood and media. Ironically, people who consider X panic as silly, swear another Y panic was true and justifiable, even while most of those panics were based on fear and exaggerations. The Satanic Panic seems to be just another interaction of a trend that is very American.\n\nI do remember preachers mentioning random Pop stuff to be \"Satanic\" or \"Demonic\", but even that was rare, and ironically the trend of Real Organized Satanism seems to be more a trend caused by Hollywood films rather than by any religion. \n\nHistorically, I was reading about how Catholics in the Middle Ages mostly did not really consider Witches a real thing either (although witchcraft was considered real, it was seen as a sin), and almost all prosecution of them was done by mobs or people trying to blame someone for their bad harvest. Regardless, the Catholic Church indeed prosecuted heretics and other groups that were not considered Catholic, but that is another topic.\n\n**Note**: I'm not talking about atheist people who claim to be Satanists, nor neo-gnostics that use the term and call God the demiurge. Satanism is often defined as pure evil by their own definition, and most of those groups are just humanist groups, so those groups were never considered Satanist, and are rather seen as posers and attention-seekers.",

The Spaniards believed in Christianity, believing in one God. The Mayan culture is believed to be a pagan religion by the Spaniards, but that is according to the religion of the Spaniards. The question is if any religion is truly the correct one? The Mayans only knew of what they believed in. It wasn’t until a mass of people came in and told them that their religion is no good. The problem is that is a subjective statement because you can’t definitively say your religion is correct over others. Does any of this make some sense? I’m trying to get my thoughts into words.

        "author": "duckyydreams",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/za89k5/searching_for_participants_again_study_on/",
        "text": "Hello all!\n\nMy name is Avery, and I am an undergraduate psychology student. You may remember the post that I made over the summer asking for participants for the first part of my Senior Capstone Project. This is part two of the same research project! I feel I have properly established a theoretical basis for the research and am still seeking out participants from various religious or non-religious communities to participate. I got a great diversity and quantity of responses last time and am excited to see if I can get the same this time!\n\nYou are free and encouraged to participate in this study whether you participated in the first one or not. This study is also observing connections between cognition and religiosity, but with a few new caveats such as free responses to questions regarding your journey (or anti-journey) with religion and the possibility to describe any religious experiences you may or may not have encountered. This is the true center of what I wanted to study initially, and I am very excited to hear your stories!\n\nDue to the nature of my preliminary findings and resource availability, you will recognize the two cognitive assessments from the first study, albeit with the longer one being shortened as much as possible with a new random sample of questions. I know that many who took the assessment the first time were not keen on the math-logic-based questions for a variety of very valid reasons, but due to my previous results and resource limitations, I just tried to make it as manageable as possible with the critiques I received last time. I ask that if you chose to take the study again that you still answer to the best of your ability, even if you remember the questions from last time.\n\nAs stated last time, I am planning to post the findings of these bouts of studies briefly to this subreddit in May of 2023. However, if you would like, you can message me, and I can communicate the preliminary findings from the first study to you privately. However, I ask that if you intend to take this study, you wait until after you have taken it so as not potentially taint the results. I also ask that you do not communicate the findings to anyone who may intend to take the study for the same reason. \n\nI would greatly appreciate it if you would help me with my research! The responses are completely anonymous and encrypted (I cannot trace anything you say back to you), and this research is IRB-approved through my institution. While I am not getting paid to do this study this time, I am being funded by my school to provide a drawing for a gift card. I reached out to the moderators of this group for approval to post these studies for the initial post. However, the moderators may remove the post or message me with concerns at any time if they feel it necessary. If you are interested in participating, please click the link at the bottom of the post. There is a more detailed welcome message and introduction letter once you enter the survey, and you are free to leave at any time if you decide not to participate. If you chose to leave the study before completion, your data will not be included in the analysis.\n\nMuch of the research based on religiosity and cognition is primarily focused on the dimensions of simply religious or non-religious, and often focuses on one religion. I wanted to get as many perspectives on religiosity as possible, so I’m really looking for a diverse selection of religious or nonreligious identities (including the ex-communities on Reddit) to make my research as comprehensive and sympathetic to as many groups as I can. As this is an academic study, I don’t have any intentions with the results other than to expand the general understanding of how cognition relates to religiosity. I believe the results of this research could shine a light on how to better communicate with others in conversations relating to religion.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns in relation to the study, you may reach out to me, my research supervisor, or the IRB through my institution. You may reach out to me on Reddit if you wish, but I also have contact information for all three parties in the consent form of the study. I encourage any discussion or questions in the comments in relation to this study or previous research in the field.\n\nThank you so much for your consideration! I am looking forward to the results!\n\n[https://stephens.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_bru3V8LLIfPbJVY](https://stephens.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bru3V8LLIfPbJVY)",

Even the most bitter of atheists will often talk about American Indian religions favorably, while belittling some Lutheran dude for not “believing in science”. \n\nJust a random thought I had—I don’t have any strong feelings toward or against any of these ideas.",
