        "text": "It seems like every other school's admin gets the fact that dedicated period means to leave students tf alone so they can worry about boards and not make them continue to turn in assignments, but my school doesn't seem to understand that. They decide to tack on random courses that are complete wastes of time to the end of the semester right before we go into dedicated. THEN for the icing on the cake, we now have to take a biostats course DURING dedicated, which is only composed of a few quizzes, but I feel like the principal of giving us additional pointless assignments that for some reason factor into a grade for us, is crazy. I feel like it's strictly so that the school can check a box and say \"We also do this, in order to make students better prepared for boards, etc.\", but clearly would never admit that they \"offer\" these \"*perks\"* DURING our dedicated 2nd year. \n\nI just want to get the perspective of people at other schools on this. Do your schools actually leave you alone during dedicated? Or am I just living in a fantasy land where I believe that admin should fuck off during this time? \n\nAs far as the biostats and other useless courses, it'd be one thing if it was optional... but clearly that’s not the case here.",

Just want to get a degree or some sort of certification and hopefully get a job but I'm not really sure what to do at this point. I see so many people working at the hospital or any health care related and they're like students but also work at the same time like how do they get jobs in hospitals or clinics",

It happened in my hometown and things were already pretty stressing here and the government closed all universities including med schools and we started online education last week. My medical school is also a huge hospital complex and today they announced that most of the complex will be evacuated because the buildings are old and not earthquake-resistant. (There is also a big earthquake expected in my city) They might move us to somewhere else and there is currently not much information about what’s next. I really liked the campus and being a med student was one of the things that helped me keep a good mood. I don’t know what to do anymore.\nDon’t know what writing this will achieve.

The landlord has been threatening to sue us 3 so she finally paid off most of it last week with about 1000$ remaining on the balance.\n\n\n\nI was away this weekend and when I came back to the house at 8 PM Sunday, she had moved out all of her things, and had stolen a significant amount of shared property + some very expensive belongings and also blocked me. She also left behind one of her cats.\n\n\n\nNow the problem is that she will likely not be paying rent this coming March and there is an additional 1000$ owed on the balance. I'm pretty sure the landlord will sue us 3 unless I pay off everything myself and break the lease (about 5000$).** If the lawsuit goes through I'll likely have a favorable outcome but ill still be named in the suit and I'm worried that will affect my chances of matching (does anyone have any insight on this?) as I'm applying for a relatively competitive specialty.** Besides that my application, from a mid tier DO school, is solid (high-class rank, honored every shelf, projected 250+ step 2, recent research, decent volunteering, etc).\n\n\n\nSo I guess I'm asking for advice on how to proceed, should I just take the lawsuit (that will probably eventually drop my name, although not in time for residency apps) or should I just eat the costs of rent and try to recoup it myself from her in some way?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/11d26m6/seeking_advice_on_couples_residency_match_that/",
        "text": "  \n\nHi all, current medical student and longtime lurker here. I was hoping to get some insight on an issue myself and my SO are facing.\n\nI am a medical student and US citizen at an international school in the Caribbean you have definitely heard of (think \"Harvard of the Caribbean); my SO is a medical student at a mid-tier DO school in the states, and is one year ahead of me. I am a first year, and she is wrapping up her 2nd year and is preparing to take COMLEX/USMLE soon. We met in undergrad, have been together for nearly 7 years and have been able to maintain happiness and consistency in our relationship despite the many challenges of both being medical students, and being geographically separated. Needless to say, it has been incredibly difficult, but we are committed to making things work and look forward to the day that we are both attendings and can have 7 Pomeranians and no children..\n\nMy SO has wanted to be a Psychiatrist for over a decade now - she has never had a shred of doubt that Psych will be her chosen field. I on the other hand have had to temper my expectations due to the well-known challenges of matching as a future IMG. I am more aware than most of my colleagues of the stigma that we will face when it comes time to apply for residency, and I am mostly at peace with the idea of not ending up in any of my dream specialties (Anesthesia, OBGYN, Surgery, etc). In short, I will be thrilled so long as I can avoid Pediatrics/Family Medicine or any dreaded \"preliminary\" placement. While I know this is almost entirely dependent on both step score and LOR's, I am simply trying to give some background information.\n\nSo, back to the issue at hand: residency placement for the two of us. Our ultimate goal is to end up doing residency in the same city, so that we can live together and are not apart for longer than is absolutely necessary. However, we can't do couples match for obvious reasons (different grad years, MD vs DO status, etc). After countless hours of research into the most DO-Psych/IMG friendly programs, it has become apparent to me that our best chances to end up together for residency is to apply to densely populated cities (NY/LA, etc) with the most amount of IMG/DO-friendly residency programs so that our chances are improved. It seems like New York, with all its faults, will be the best place to aim for. Obviously she will apply 1 year before me, so wherever she ends up will bottleneck my choices significantly.\n\nI had a though that when my SO begins her intern year, wherever it may be, she may be able to sway a program director at the same hospital to sort of \"keep an eye out\" for my application, but this is almost certainly unrealistic, wishful thinking to think an Intern could accomplish something like that.\n\nWe have 2 goals in life: to be excellent future physicians, and to be able to spend our lives together. It was an INCREDIBLY hard pill to swallow for both of us when I packed my bags and went to the Caribbean, and believe me when I say it truly was the last resort after completing an MS and applying multiple years in a row in the states. We are looking for advice from people who have been through anything similar to this before. We are looking for guidance to improve our chances of at least being able to live together for the majority of our time in residency.\n\nAny help here is tremendously appreciated.\n\nPS: PLEASE do not add anything unnecessarily negative about the fact that I am an IMG. I have read it all before, as reddit/SDN is truly an echo-chamber of the same comments on this matter. I have poured through 10 years of match data from the \"big 4\" schools and I am completely aware of the forced attrition these schools participate in to keep their \"match rate\" high. Simply put, I am so painfully aware of the stigma and additional challenges I/we will face in the future. We are committed to making this work by any means necessary!",

I'm torn between biomed engineering, clinical psychology, and general surgery. What I'm most hesitant about choosing general (perhaps cardiothoracic) surgery is that I know it will take years to finally finish. I know clinical psychology is similar but I (and this may be entirely wrong) think that I would at least have more free time and less hours in the end. \n\nI guess I'll just be straight forward with the questions:\n\nIs it affordable for a student with no help from parents and only loans to be put through medical school?\n\nIs it more time consuming than clinical psychology/biomedical engineering?\n\nHow much is the work load in college? I would like to still be able to continue writing and other hobbies.",

I think as of now, I want to pursue a fellowship in either thoracic or plastics (maybe even breast). Right now, I am debating between a middle tier academic program with a 5 year fellowship (with the option to step out for research) or a pretty prestigious 7 year academic program with great fellowships matches. I know the answer seems obvious, but to be honest, the idea of taking an extra 2 years, and engaging in research (which TBH i do not like that much) is kinda jarring. Also I am a female and that would really delay my personal life as well. If being at a 7 year program would be best for my future and my career goals, then I would definitely just bite the bullet and deal with it, but if I could achieve my goals at a mid tier 5 year with optional research, then that would be a little more ideal.\n\nAny and all help is much appreciated!",

There's an argument to be made regarding the importance of markets as a whole but the marginal impact of any single trader is almost meaningless. To that extent the job itself is gamified and doesn't offer much back to society. I don't really want to go into old age (mid 20s atm) reflecting on how meaningless my work was despite the money.\n\nMy mother was a cardiologist in our native country but stopped practicing in her 40s after arriving in the US. Now in her 60s, she saids the most rewarding period of her life outside of motherhood consisted of her time as a cardiologist despite the stress. \n\nJust posting to see if anyone has gone down this road from a similar background and what your thoughts have been since (I.e. what adapting was like, most difficult portions so far, general thoughts, etc.).
