It's great for the energy that they have, they just like to go completely haywire and running non stop for an hour straight.\n\nFan favorite: [Sky Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JTbAOt3BKA) (\"I miss you baby\" would you consider this inappropriate?)\n\nIs mentioning the word \"baby\" too much inappropriate? \"Stepping in the club\"? Kissing? Rebellious songs?\n\nOne song I really want to play and know the kids will love is, \"Every Time We Touch\" by Cascada, but I really doubt this would be kid appropriate. On the flip side, I have seen kids as young as 4 listening to Nicki Minaj or songs in general referencing or directly talking about sex/drugs/curse words (parents vs a teacher, I understand the difference).\n\n**TL;DR: I'm in the midst of finding ORIGINAL songs (not Kidz Bop) that are appropriate for children.

I then went to the toilet and when I came back, I played it again and thought to myself, \"This is reminding me of Come As You Are\". And then I thought to myself, \"It's not *just* Come As You Are it's reminding me of\". I ended up with a list of eight songs:\n\n1. [When in Rome -- The Promise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HI_xFQWiYU)\n2. [Nirvana -- Come As You Are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vabnZ9-ex7o)\n3. [Duran Duran -- Save a Prayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Uxc9eFcZyM)\n4. [The Cure -- Lullaby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijxk-fgcg7c)\n5. [Nike Kershaw -- The Riddle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDygS0a6Tgo)\n6. [Tears for Fears -- Pale Shelter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUfcT5OoP-8)\n7. [Duran Duran -- Ordinary World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqIACCH20JU)\n8. [No Doubt -- Don't Speak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR3Vdo5etCQ)\n\nI've just finished listening to them and I'm still not sure if I actually do think they, or a subset of them, feel similar to each other or not. Lullaby and, ironically given it was the first one I made the link to, Come As You Are are a bit different, but I forgot what I was doing and didn't really feel a jarring transition from song to song. That makes me feel like there is a shared spirit or energy or soul to this set of songs, but there's still that niggling doubt so I need to talk about them as a group. So I came here.\n\np.s. sorry for the title gore but I decided \"am I the only one who thinks these songs sound similar?\" was both a bit clickbaity (against the sub's rules) and also made it sound like I was suggesting plagiarism.",
