It doesnt matter which one it is, where it is or how busy it is, they always seem to take a few minutes longer per customer than actually required. Often while half the staff are stood chatting about things that you can here are not work related. I've just been in one with about 20 people waiting, some queueing to be served, some waiting for prescriptions. It was packed, yet rather than serving people quickly to get them out of the shop one person was doing all of the work at the counter while the others were either sat at their workstation on their computers or in a group standing having a chat about Christmas. I've also been in some where they just stand around chatting even if no one else is in there and I'm stood waiting. Its not unusual to take 3-5 minutes to get served for something on the shelf behind the counter. \n\nCan anyone name any other people who are this slow doing their job? Could you imagine if other shops were this slow, say 5 minutes to sell a packet of cigarettes(I'm using that example as they have restrictions on sales) or some beer in a pub.",

He goes out of his way to hide my packages in suitable locations if I'm out, and if I'm in he waits for me to answer the door. \n\nAll my friends and family are struggling this year with awful delivery experiences, made far worse by the strikes. They regale each other with anecdotes of their latest botched deliveries, disappearing packages and invisible or surly delivery drivers. Nothing is more bonding than have a good old collective moan. \n\nA few shops I'd ordered christmas stuff from online posted it out later than I'd have liked, and my aunt always misses the last posting date, so I didn't think they'd arrive in time. No big deal, I thought, I'll find plenty of camaraderie to commiserate with how crappy postal deliveries are.\n\nBut all week my parcels have arrived with no issue. I was out all day Monday, got a missed delivery card from royal mail \"yeah, typical, that's the last I'll see of that then\", book a redelivery while thinking what's the point? Then it arrived when I booked it for. \n\nSame thing happened on Wed, out all day, two missed deliveries. \"Bet it won't let me book for tomorrow, it's already 10pm and there's a strike on friday\". But I *could* book a redelivery, and both parcels got delivered! The guy rang the doorbell and everything. Then in the evening another royal mail person turned up with the last package I was waiting for, he was cheerful and wished me a happy christmas. Bastard.\n\nSo I've had all my parcels before christmas. No one understands how left out I'm feeling. It's no fun being an outlier.",
