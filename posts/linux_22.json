        "text": "“krfcommd” is a kernel which is started by executing “kthread\\_run()” function ([https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/net/bluetooth/rfcomm/core.c#L2215](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/net/bluetooth/rfcomm/core.c#L2215)). The kernel thread executes the “rfcomm\\_run()” function ([https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/net/bluetooth/rfcomm/core.c#L2109](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/net/bluetooth/rfcomm/core.c#L2109)). Thus, we can say that “krfcommd” is responsible for RFCOMM connections ([https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57152408/what-is-the-internal-mechanics-of-socket-function](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57152408/what-is-the-internal-mechanics-of-socket-function)).\n\nRFCOMM  (Radio Frequency Communication) is a set of transport protocols on top  of L2CAP which provides emulated RS-232 serial ports. It provides a  simple reliable data stream (like TCP). It is used directly by many  telephony related profiles as a carrier for AT commands, as well as  being a transport layer for OBEX over Bluetooth ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_Bluetooth\\_protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bluetooth_protocols)).\n\nMoreover, there is also an “rfcomm” cli tool in Linux. It is used to inspect and maintain RFCOMM configuration ([https://linux.die.net/man/1/rfcomm](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rfcomm)) .For more information about RFCOMM I suggest reading [https://www.btframework.com/rfcomm.htm](https://www.btframework.com/rfcomm.htm). You can also go over the protocol specification ([https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/rfcomm-1-1/](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/rfcomm-1-1/)).\n\nAlso,  RFCOMM protocol supports up to 60 simultaneous connections between two  Bluetooth devices. The number of connections that can be used  simultaneously is implementation-specific. For the purposes of RFCOMM, a  complete communication path involves two applications running on  different devices (the communication endpoints) with a communication  segment between them ([https://www.amd.e-technik.uni-rostock.de/ma/gol/lectures/wirlec/bluetooth\\_info/rfcomm.html](https://www.amd.e-technik.uni-rostock.de/ma/gol/lectures/wirlec/bluetooth_info/rfcomm.html)).\n\nLastly,  RFCOMM is implemented as a kernel module. Thus, it can be compiled  directly to the kernel or separate kernel module — in the screenshot  below we can see it compiled as a separate file.\n\nSee you next time ;-) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jljrdhekwfea1.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=07a3f9d4044654fbdaab158c549cfb0b736ca331",

Thousands of years of evolution have allowed them to sniff out defective software with incredible efficiency. Even Wayland sessions that “work” look uncanny and unnatural to a seasoned sysadmin. Your bizarre render loop is a dead giveaway. And even if you manage to get a drunk Arch user home with you, he’ll turn tail and bolt the second he gets a whiff of your high latency due to forced VSync.\n\nYou will never be happy. You wrench out a fake smile every single morning and tell yourself it’s going to be ok, but deep inside you feel the technical debt creeping up like a weed, ready to crush you under the unbearable weight.\n\nEventually it’ll be too much to bear - you’ll log into the GitLab instance, select the project, press Delete, and plunge it into the cold abyss. Your users will find the deletion notice, heartbroken but relieved that they no longer have to live with the unbearable shame and disappointment. They’ll remember you as the biggest failure of open source development, and every passerby for the rest of eternity will know a badly run project has failed there. Your code will decay and go to historical archives, and all that will remain of your legacy is a codebase that is unmistakably poorly written.\n\nThis is your fate. This is what you chose.

        "text": "Hi everyone! This is a quick update regarding my Linux portable install script!\n\nAs a quick summary, I made a portable, customizable and modular linux install script which at the moment, uses ArchLinux as base\n\nThe idea is that it is customizable, thus I can also use it as a template for other distros - though that is a WIP, please refer to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/vpn9fc/i_finally_pushed_the_first_stable_release_v100_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) for the detailed background and more information\n\nNow with that said, I have made some pretty (in my opinion) useful QoL changes as well as additional features to the installer\n\nThe following are some of the bigger changes, as well as bug fixes\n```\n[New Features]\n- Command Line Arguments (CLI) support in install script that is simple to modify\n    + -c | --config : For setting custom configuration file\n    + -d | --target-disk : For setting target disk name via CLI argument\n    + -g | --generate-config : For generating a new config file template right from the get-go\n    + -h | --help : Display help message\n    + -m | --mode : Set startup mode; DEBUG or RELEASE\n\n[Refactor/Modification]\n- Changed 'MODE' variable to a static DEBUG as the command line argument is now dynamic\n- Refactored global variables into individual functions for reusability (i.e. generating or resetting)\n```\n\nThe repository is [here](https://github.com/Thanatisia/distro-installscript-arch)\n\nFeel free to dm me or comment below on what you think and/or if you have and inputs, or perhaps features you would like to see etc\n\nThank you very much!\n\nP.S. I have also mentioned this in opensource, so you might have seen this there, thanks again!",
