However, all 5 were convicted of one or other form of obstruction of proceedings \\[felonies\\]. Jury rejected the arguments that this was merely a protest that got out of hand and instead found that this was a well-planned insurrection in rendering the verdicts. \n\nThe Justice Department, which has argued that the US Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, was more than just a political protest that got out of control — but rather a violent attack on the seat of American democracy and an effort to keep Biden out of the Oval Office by any means necessary.\n\nThe history of [the seditious conspiracy statute ](https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/politics/seditious-conspiracy-oath-keepers-trial)dates back to the start of the Civil War when Congress made it a crime to conspire to overthrow the US government or to conspire to use force to “prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States.”\n\nIn the infrequent cases when prosecutors have brought the charge, they have not always been successful in securing a conviction.\n\nThe last time it was charged – against a Michigan militia accused of plotting an attack on law enforcement – the count was dismissed by a judge in 2012 who said the Justice Department failed to show that there was a “concrete agreement to forcibly oppose the United States government.”\n\nOfficer  Fanone who was wounded on January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol remarked that the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol did a good job making connections between former President Donald Trump and leaders of the Oath Keepers and other right-wing groups during its investigation and public hearings.\n\n“So if I was the former president and many of his allies, I would be shaking in my boots seeing these verdicts coming down.\"\n\nAre these verdicts a deterrence to such behavior or would these verdicts turn them into Martyrs?",
