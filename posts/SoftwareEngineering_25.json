        "text": "Hi everyone.\n\nThis is a long post, so you guys are warned! :)\n\nI am in a situation at work where there is the possibility for redesigning everything.\nI want to take this opportunity in order to step up in my career, and anyway at least learn as much as I can to grow professionally.\n\nWe have sensors installed on customers' premises that count people (for instance, installed on doors in shops).\nEvery 5 minutes, these sensors send data to our server that is made like this: `(sensor_id, timestamp, count_in)`.\nFor instance, it could be `(2018-03-10T12:00:00Z, 42, 10)`, meaning that in the 5 minutes interval `2018-03-10T11:55:00Z`-`2018-03-10T12:00:00Z`, the sensor with `id=42` counted `10` people.\n\nThe goal is to collect all of this data in order to then be able to show statistics and perform analysis: the typical scenario is to show how the number of people that enters a shop changes over time.\nFor instance, we could want to see the number of people that entered a shop every day of a month, or every month of a year, for a single sensor, or for a group of sensors.\n\nTo do this we need to perform sums on the data. For instance, in a day we usually have 288 records (5 minutes intervals in 24 hours), so if we want to calculate the total number of people that entered a shop in a particular year, we would have to sum the data of `288 * 365=105120` records, and the number grows linearly with the number of sensors we want to sum together (if we want to sum the data from 4 different sensors, we need to sum `288*365*4=420480` records).\n\nOf course we are not Google, but I think we are talking about a decent amount of data to be processed.\nAt the moment, we have around `3500` sensors, which bring us to around `1000000` records produced everyday, which bring us to around `11 tps`.\nThis number should -hopefully- increase over time with more customers, or with updates to current customers (new sensors etc).\nEach 5 minutes data could be summarized into `~100 Bytes`, which, under current conditions, means `~100 MB/day`, and `~36 GByte/year`.\n\n**CURRENT SOLUTION:**\n\nThe current solution is a PostgreSQL database that models data as follows.\n*Keep in mind that the choice of modeling the db this way was not really justified with tests/benchmarks of any kind, but was left to the \"feeling\" of the previous developer.*\n\nThere is **only one** table that holds the data.\nEach row represents the data of a particular day and a particular sensor.\nEach row is identified by the couple (`date, sensor_id`), date being the day without the time.\nThe row then holds a `jsonb` column which contains all the \"minute\" data, whose keys are the datetime.\nThe row also holds an integer value which is the total sum of the counts of each detail in the jsonb.\nThis value is updated as new minute data enters the system.\nSo, for instance, there could be a row (`2018-03-10, 42`) that represents the data of the sensor with `id=42` in the day `2018-03-10`.\nThe `jsonb` column of that row cointains all the data to the minute, and their keys are `2018-03-10THH:mm:ssZ`.\n\nThis structure is useful when we want to obatin statistics with certain granularity. For instance, if I want to obtain the total count of a year for a sensor, I would have to sum only 365 record (one per day) instead of 105120 (365*288). This helps particulary if I want multiple sensors (like, total count of 4 sensors, and this happens), because that number increase linearly with the number of sensors I want.\n\nI see two problems here:\n\n1. \"scalability\": even in case of no more customers, we keep having data. \nThe db is going to grow even if we add no more customers.\nOf course we are not talking about petabytes of data, but in the long run this could be an issue.\nAnd performing grouping and sums, and averages over big amount of data seems to be a bottleneck.\n\n2. This structure needs us to compute and update the aggregated count values as data enters.\nThis puts a lot of load on the server (we need to use strong transaction isolation).\nAlso, sensors need to be assumed as unreliable, so our priority is to insert the data they send as fast as possible in order to avoid retransmissions.\n\n**SOLUTIONS I AM THINKING ABOUT**\n\n1. Replace the data table with a data table whose key is (`dateTIME, sensor_id`) instead of (`date, sensor_id`).\nSo, data would now be memorized directly per minute, without aggregation.\nThis should speed up a lot the writing, but now , when I have to perform sums I need to read more data (for 1 year on one sensor I need `288*365=105120` instead of just `365`)\n\n2. I honestly don't see why I should stay with a relational DB for this kind of data, instead of migrating to a NoSQL db.\nI would like advices on this: if you think it could be a good idea, and if so what could be a solution.\n\n\n3. If we go for the NoSQL solution, we would lose the classic aggregation function (SUM; AVG...) which are what we essentially need to perform our statistics.\nI don't exactly know how to replace them.\nI had a quick intro to spark and Scala a couple of year ago, maybe that could be a possible solution?\nFor instance, I could query the data in the NoSQL and then perform a parallel sum of some sort using spark.\nIs this a good design idea? What alternatives are there?\n\nIn general, given that this is the scenario, do you have any suggestion in mind?\n\nThank you for your patience",

        "text": "I am a software engineer of above-average skill.  I'd say I code twice to three times as fast as your average developer of my level of experience.  I'm actually good, too, so it's not a case of quantity over quality.\n\nSo let me tell you what I like to do.\n\nYour typical application usually involves a project that is checked into a repo.  However, the project that I do all my direct coding in is actually a local master decoy branch (MDB) that's not tracked by our repo.  Three times a day per eight-hour shift, a local service I wrote scans the MDB for files modified since last scan and copies the contents to decoy capture branches (DCB).  So, at the end of my day, on my local machine I will end up with three new DCBs named MyProject201704010800, MyProject201704011200, and MyProject201704011600 using \"MyProjectyyyyMMddhhmm\" as the convention.\n\nThe idea is that, over time, I build up a queue of DCBs, each of which serving as a snapshot of my progress taken every 2-3 hours since the start of the project.  At the end of my eight-hour shift, I take the next branch capture in the queue and copy its contents to the actual live branch that's tracked by the repo (I call this process \"dequeuing\").  I then check it in and log off for the day.  So my boss not only sees that I am checking in daily, but it also appears that the quantity work I am checking in is consistent with that of a developer of my skill level.  However, the reality is that what's getting checked in was actually coded days or even weeks ago.  Effing brilliant.\n\nHow does this get even better?  I am a virtual employee, so, after I complete a project, I spend the next week or so doing nothing but watching TV and playing video games here at home.  The only actual work I do during this time is make sure my capture branches are being properly dequeued.\n\nIt does get a bit tricky, though, because I have to demo my work and also provide status updates to the project manager.  So, along with my capture branches, I also store a log that serves as a sort of diary that allows me to familiarize myself with what I was working on at that time.  Otherwise, I could get into a bit of hot water if I lost track of my position along the timeline and inadvertently unveiled a feature from the future.\n\nAnother issue that took me forever to resolve was how to merge a bug fix in the current branch all the way up through the other decoy capture branches.  Since they're all local, I've had to rely on third party tools.  It's quite simple how it works:  I merge current branch into decoy #10, merge decoy #10 into #9, #9 into # 8, etc.  Surprisingly, I've never lost any code doing this.\n\nWhy I don't think I am doing anything wrong:  If I were to complete projects in real time, I'd only see a small portion of that return in my annual employee assessment (bonus, raise, etc).  In other words, my pay would never be proportionate to the quantity and quality of work I produce and the rate at which I produce it.  Consider it a virtual raise if you will.  \n\nNow I'll go ahead and say, too, that there have been times when I've lost progress and have had to work overtime to build the queue back up.  Sometimes, though, I'll just work overtime for the hell of it and build up my queue.  I look at it as an investment to aquiring additional leisure time.\n\nNow all I need to do is figure out how to automatically log in through VPN at 8am, fire up my project, and have it \"do stuff\" on its own to feign legitimate database activity.  If I can pull that off, I'll be sleep in until 10am every day.\n\nSo what's everyone's opinion on this?",

What are some big differences between back-end systems (Mongo/Cassandra)?

It’s a short term project that will probably take a month, part time. I’ve got a full time job and I haven’t really done any contract work before. What’s the best way to set this up if I don’t plan on doing this regularly. LLC and incorporation seem like overkill. 1099 independent contractor? \n\nAlso, I need to come up with a rate. I know this depends heavily on the job and experience level of the developer, but any ballpark numbers would be helpful.",

If I go with PC, should I build my own desktop or find a good laptop that I can bring with me to class?\n\nEssentially I want a versatile computer that I could do my class work on and run coding programs and still play games during my free time.\n\nWhat would your advice to me be?\n\nP.S. one game in particular that I would really like to work on is DayZ Stand-alone, which currently only runs on windows :(",
