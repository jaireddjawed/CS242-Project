        "text": "The childhood chapter of my life is over. The adult chapter has begun. The difference is, I'm holding the pen this time. \n\nIt's just an ordinary day. I'm drinking coffee and listening to Elton John and not doing anything particularly momentous, but then that feeling comes over me. It's a feeling I've been getting more often, since I stopped worrying about what my mom thinks of me. \n\nFor a moment, I feel completely clear, peaceful and calm. It's like the sunshine pierces through my clouds of anxiety, anger and hurt and lights everything up for a moment. \n\nAnd in that light I see it all clearly. I want to hold onto this feeling, so I can remember it, until I naturally feel it every day. \n\nIt's all so clear. People are not all out to take advantage of me and hurt me, especially not my boyfriend. He's a good, kind man and I can safely let my guard down and trust him with all my heart. I can stop hurting him out of fear that he will hurt me. \n\nLove is not an obligation, a debt to be repaid, a contract, a threat or something used to control. Love is gladly opening up your heart and sharing your time, affection, wisdom and kindness with another not because it benefits you, but because seeing them happy brings you joy. \n\nOver the last little while I've been letting all the bad go, and so much good is rushing in to take it's place. I'm not perfect, and I never will be. But, dear god, I am so much better than I once was and I can't wait to continue healing and growing. \n\nOne day I'm going to make a baby with the man I love and I'm not going to fail as a parent and pass down the pain that I inherited from my mother. I'm stronger than that. She lodged hard crystals of anger, contempt and resentment deep into my heart. I'm going to dissolve them with pure, pure love. \n\nEverything is going to be okay. ",

        "text": "So about a month ago my mom got summoned to court because my Ndad wanted to stop paying child support. He claims that because he's a felon, he can't find a job, and so can't pay child support on my sister and I (I'm 19, my sis is 18 but not yet graduated HS). \n\nI thought that after deciding 8 years ago that we didn't want to see him, he'd stop bothering us. After all, he said if we decided to stop seeing him, he wouldn't ever contact us again, and then guilt tripped by saying that included birthday gifts and Christmas cards. At this point we didn't care because he was emotionally abusive towards my mom (they're divorced), me, my sister, and my brother (who is only related to me through him), and physically abused (and from what I've heard currently abusing) that same younger brother. The only times we've had to hear about him is when he's been abusive to my little brother and word got back to us.\n\nBut then she gets a court summons. I was up at school at the time and so was unable to go, but both my mom and my sister went. My mom has been unable to work because my sister has depression and suicidal tendencies, and someone has to stay home with her when she gets bad (my stepdad, one of the best things to ever happen to me, is full time employed). Well when they went to court, my Ndad of course tries to manipulate the magistrate by saying that he's been unable to find a job because of the felony and that his business that he owns isn't doing well (he owns a website building website that, as someone who knows HTML and uses it regularly, completely sucks. I can add a link if you want to see). His defense also included that he didn't think that mom actually had to stay home with my sister and was making it up. \n\nEventually they settled on a deal where the payments would temporarily decrease and his license would be returned, but if he missed even one payment during the 6 month decrease, the payments go right back up and his license is gone.\n\nI just hate even thinking about him because he was so emotionally manipulative back when we had to see him, and apparently still is. Even though we hadn't seen him in literal years, I still have to cry sometimes just thinking about how much he ruined.\n\nI really just had to rant about this to someone not emotionally connected. I've been the strong one when dealing with him since I was 10 because I'm the older sister and my mom deserved to lean on someone and not be strong all the time.\n\nTldr; emotionally and physically abusive felon narcissistic father takes us to court to stop paying child support. He kind of gets his way, gets in one last emotionally abusive phrase, and gets to leave. I needed a rant.",

        "text": "I've been going to therapy for awhile now, and my doctor really wants me to put my family behind me and basically forget about them, just remove them from my life completely. For the most part, I've done that. My Ngrandmother is not in my life, nor is my Eaunt and her Nhusband. But my mom....I am always hesitant to call her an N because she grew up the scapegoat to my grandmother and me and her shared similar roles. She has bipolar and depression, and frequently decides it is better for her to be off meds(it is not. This has lead to suicide attempts). She has a lot of issues, and a lot of narc tendencies,  but it is still so hard for me to say outright that she is a narc.\n\nBut she causes a lot of problems in my life. For as long as I can remember, I was always flying in to save the day and glue the pieces back together. I had to parent her a lot. As a child, this was tiring but I couldn't do anything about it. As an adult, I moved to the otherside of the country and hide her posts on facebook. She'll never call me about her problems(not only because of her phone anxiety, that I too have, but also because she rarely pays her bills so her phone is usually shut off). \n\nBut going very very low contact with her isn't cutting her out of my life. The reason I can't go completely no contact with her is because I still have 5 siblings(ranging from just turned 18 to 11 years old) that live with her. These kids have nothing. My mom can't keep her bills paid, she doesn't work, her depression/bipolar/possible narcissism prevents her from pretty much doing anything. As far as I am aware, all she does is sit on the couch(that she also sleeps on) and is on the internet all day. Sure, my siblings get fed, but they don't really get homework help, or attention, or basically anything. Getting fed is not a constant either. I remember one Christmas one of my sisters(8 years old at the time) was crying because the water was shut off and she was afraid they'd \"die of dehydration.\" So, uh....clearly they are not in the best of care.\n\nSince they are kids, everybody wants me to call CPS on my mom, and get the kids out of there, but where would they go? They have no family really. All the adults in my family are basically the worst people. My siblings could not find shelter with them. My dad(their dad) isn't much better than my mom. He lives in a tiny house too, and certainly couldn't take my siblings in either. Most of them hate him anyway. Last time he tried to take some of them to live with him(shortly after a suicide attempt by my mother), one of them ran away.\n\nAnd they can't come live with me. I live in a 660 squarefoot apartment. There is barely enough room here for me, my partner, and our two cats, let alone 5 kids. Moving into a bigger place isn't an option either. We live in the Bay area, we can barely afford this small place.\n\nI'm afraid of CPS splitting them up. They are all they have. The two youngest call each other twins, they are best friends. The two oldest would not survive without each other(seriously. One attempted suicide and the other was my main contact point in making sure he was ok. When he got out of the hospital, she basically took him under her wing, introduced him to all her friends, and now they go to anime conventions together. They are very close now)\n\nI am the most scared for the middle most two. One(M) lives with her dad now, and she is at least doing a little better. She seems happier, but clearly her parents have left their mark on her. The other one, who is 14, is clearly done with this family. He's the one who ran away. He hates both his parents, and has tried to stab his brother(the one who attempted suicide). My mom made sure to make M hate herself because she is overweight, so M has a lot of self esteem and emotional issues. \n\nBut I can't help them. I can't get them in therapy. I can't give them money. I can't make sure that their toxic parents don't fuck them up completely. All I can basically do is stand back and watch. I know this. And clearly watching isn't helping me. But I'm afraid of my siblings feeling like I abandoned them.\n\nWhat should I do? How can I put my awful toxic family behind me, while still looking out for my siblings?",

        "text": "So here is [update 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/4j7d45/update_to_my_shitty_and_unfair_work_review/) and some more [background] (https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/4goznv/struggling_today_with_that_nasty_inner_voice/)\n\nSo i sent the rebuttal on Friday of last week and didn't hear anything back, which I expected since it was Friday. Monday rolls around and I prepare myself for the response. Nothing came until that evening. They asked if I could come in on wednesday to sit down with my supervisor and the head of our department. Unfortunately I can't because my son has strep AND hand foot and mouth at the same time (and Im 38 weeks pregnant. fun times). He is banned from day care for the time being and I can't find a babysitter even to go to my check up today. Anyways, I share this with them but don't offer too much information about myself except that I have been in some extreme discomfort and some pain (she asked how I was feeling directly) making it hard to walk. This is my last week of work before I start maternity leave. So my supervisor says she'll talk to the director and get back to me and sends well wishes for my son. I get another response back an hour later saying the director suggests I just go on maternity leave now because it seems like \"I have a lot on my plate.\"\n\nMy first reaction was paranoia. I thought \"OMG they are trying to get rid of me, phase me out, etc.\" So I sent the email chain to my mentor/friend who just had to resign from the company bc of health issues. She said that it did not come across that way at all (she actually brought it up before I did because she knows me so well lol) and she thinks they realized how harsh they were towards me and want me to take it easy at this point for both me and baby. So I talked to my husband and we discussed if we could handle me being off a week earlier with our finances, etc.. He was super supportive. The only thing holding me back was not wanting to let my clients down and making sure they had a good transition. So i called my supervisor and discussed it with her (which I think added to my professionalism and dedication!). \n\nShe was super supportive (and tends to be when I am confident, firm and direct and not an emotional mess). She said that she totally understands how I feel. She pointed out that I had a duty to myself as well and if I went into labor today, they wouldn't transition anyways. We discussed how it would impact my clients and we came to the conclusion that they would be fine. So, as of last night-I am on maternity leave about 4 days earlier. I also asked to have the meeting about my yearly review when I return from maternity leave. \n\nSo high five for me for taking control of the situation!\n\nAnd I am SO glad Im on maternity leave because my back and pelvis are KILLING ME. I really hope I'm not starting labor so soon....",

        "text": "I've posted the back story to this elsewhere but not on LAN I don't think. \n\nEmma (not her real name) is my oldest childhood friend. We didn't go to the same school but our parents were close friends and we saw a lot of each other as kids. We drifted apart in my teens.\n\nWhen I went NC she was living in another country. I messaged her on Facebook to let her know. As our parents are friends it was important to me that she knew where I was at. I said I knew she might not understand but I had decided not to be in contact with them any more. She said actually she did understand. \n\nI subsequently blocked Emma's mum on Facebook after she messaged me saying I needed to ring her about my mum's birthday party. I didn't know if a) Emma's mum had turned flying monkey or b) she didn't know I was NC (I wouldn't put it past my mum to keep it quiet) but either way I wasn't going to respond. Emma has never mentioned this but the connection makes me feel uncomfortable.\n\nAbout a year later, Emma was over here visiting and she came to my house. She asked: so what's going on with your parents, why aren't you speaking to them? This felt like a slap in the face because she said she understood and because if anyone knows how crazy my parents are/were, it's her. She was *there* for quite a lot of it. I said: well, um, you know how my dad isn't exactly nice to me? She said: well he was never *nice* to you, practically from the moment you were born. \n\nAt that point I stopped trying to explain. If you don't get why that's a reason, I can't help you. And none of the people I actually consider friends have asked me to explain. \n\nI remember her telling me her parents always thought there was something off about my parents. Oh, great, big thanks to them for doing something about it then. And I felt like she was asking out of curiosity not concern, which wasn't okay with me.  \n\nShe subsequently started telling me my parents were having an anniversary party. I cut her off. Said I didn't want to hear anything about what they were doing. I remember feeling really invaded by this. I think she should have asked if I wanted to know stuff about them.\n\nSometime before she left, she told me that she was sorry we drifted apart after I attempted suicide in my teens but my parents had rung her parents and told them I didn't want to talk about it and people shouldn't ask me about it. I did want to talk about it. The fact that everyone acted like it hadn't happened was a really difficult experience for me. \n\nI did not feel she should have said this to me. I had told her I didn't want information about my parents. Then she drops this bombshell on me that gives me yet another shitty thing to add the list of things my parents did. I really didn't need to know that. There was enough already. I feel like she should have read the situation and realised she was prioritising her need to get this off her chest over my feelings. I get that it may sound okay, apologising for the friendship drifting apart. But - and I don't know how to explain this better - it felt like a very selfish apology that was about her not wanting to feel guilty. I did not want someone bringing up my parents and my suicide attempt.\n\nObviously I can't control her, only myself. This experience told me she just didn't get where I was at - seemingly out of obliviousness more than anything - and I just don't have the bandwidth to explain to people who stress me out like this. We have nothing in common any more anyway and she lived in another country so no biggie. \n\nUntil she texted a while ago saying she had moved back to my hometown. Where her parents and my parents also live (I live not so far from the Ns but don't tend to run into them) and she will no doubt see or hear about my parents regularly and, rightly or wrongly, that makes me feel unsafe. I feel like she's part of the lie. I've resigned from the charade that is my family but she isn't distanced from it. \n\nI went to therapy and told my therapist over and over that the thought of being friends with her makes me feel unsafe, but that I feel horrible because I'm her oldest friend and I feel bad blowing her off. My therapist asked if maybe it's like if I had a nut allergy and she got a job in a nut factory, ie this is about me feeling okay and safe not about me rejecting her because I'm heartless or horrible.\n\nI haven't contacted her since but today I had a missed call from her. I texted asking what was up as it made me nervous not knowing why she called. \n\nHer: *It was only that I had tried to text at some point but hadn't heard back so I thought I would try a call. We are living here now so I wanted to be back in touch. What would be the best way do you think?*\n\nI never got a text but anyway. I felt really pressurised when I read this and couldn't tell if it was actually pushy or if I was just reacting to something deeper. Which told me I really didn't want to be in touch with her. I said something about how I'm not great with calls (which is true) and things are crazy busy (which is true). She's written back saying okay she'll text then, let her know when things calm down, maybe we can have coffee. Again I feel pressurised and have totally lost objectivity on whether she's actually being pushy. \n\nSo. I don't feel okay with the idea of seeing her. I feel horrible rejecting her but I don't want to see her and I don't want to risk her springing more triggering information on me. I also don't want to explain why it was not okay to tell me those things because I am not interested in trying to teach someone how not to be insensitive. \n\nI was trying to just drift away. It hasn't worked. I don't know whether to now stop responding at all, ever, or to say something and if so what. \n\nI remember how stressed and triggered I was after I last saw her. I don't think that was her intention but that's kind of not the point. I'm now stressed and triggered again. I hate the fact I now have to seemingly be horrible to her but every option that works for me involves being hurtful to her.\n\nThis got long, sorry.\n\n**TLDR: don't want to see childhood friend who triggers me. Feeling stressed and guilty. Have lost objectivity and can't tell if she's being pushy or if I'm just experiencing it that way.**\n\nETA: I know I'm in a cloud of FOG when my posts get this long...",

Now the relationship is over (should've seen that coming), but I don't believe that there is anyone out there who would want to have sex with me, ever. I watched an episode of Law and Order SVU that dealt with a sugar baby website, which is where he found his playmate, and it made me want to vomit. He didn't leave me for her or anything. I guess it was just having to go through that whole experience and pain and it all ended up being for nothing. I signed up on a dating website, but every time I see someone I like I just think they'll never like me. They won't want me sexually. I am not desirable.

Unfortunately, I could feel myself slipping from my usual \"annoyed Marine\" response to my \"needlessly polite to abusive people\" response, which was my survival tactic for years of child modelling (Nparents also stage-parents, I had to do modelling since 1/2 year old.)  It was the same all the way through school too.\n\nI was actually really disappointed in myself, although given it was a professional conference, I don't think going \"annoyed Marine making a scene\" would be a good response either.\n\nIs this a flea? It sure doesn't feel like me, it felt like child-me going full-out fatal sobbing, although the hotel clerk said she admired how I stayed calm and safe til the staff got rid of him.\n\nIt's been two weeks and I'm still unsettled :( \n\nDoes anyone else have trouble with that \"he's only harassing you because he likes you\" mentality (Esp my fellow 40somethings here)?\n\nOr is this a flea from constantly having to ignore nasty creepers because Nparents thought my \"career\" (aka their shoving me out to work and putting $ well ahead of me - recently I discovered they spent all of what my brothers and I had earned as kids) depended on ignoring even the worst men so I could keep working, my \"career\" was more important than how I felt :(\n\nThanks everyone for listening - and if you have suggestions on digging up the root of this problem, I'm all ears!",

        "text": "There are a lot of things in my life that I struggle with thanks to my nparents. Sometimes it's overwhelming and feels like I can't do anything right. \n\nI had a realization  the other day after my new therapist told me he founded it interesting that my triggers and anxieties all surround low self esteem/security/abandonment because when he watches me talk about my husband and son, it's the exact opposite. That got me thinking. \n\nMy husband is my safe place. He is the most amazing and wonderful man whom I can truly be myself with. But I chalked that up to hard work on both our parts to over come my abandonment issues etc. but then I look at my son. I've always said parenting him has been the best form of therapy for me because it allows me to parent the broken girl inside of me. It's the only time that Nmonkey is off my back. So I started to wonder why? Why am I able to be the parent I never had? Why am I able to be whole with him but not in other aspects of my life? And the realization hit me. \n\nMy nparents were unable to taint/wreck my parenting of my child. I started going LC shortly after he was born and Nc by the time he was 1.5 yro. I've been the one (with my hubs) to make all the decisions for him *on my own.* no interference or influence form my nparents. They had no time to \"break me in\" or \"condition me\" to how *they* wanted me to parent my child. It's one of the few aspects of my life that has not been conditioned or tainted by them (like my marriage!). Everything else that I struggle with (work authority, friendships, self esteem, etc.) is a direct result of their interference and conditioning and abuse. Which I guess would explain the duality. \n\nI'm gonna share with my therapist when i see him next. But it was a cool realization! Nice to know my maternal instincts are SPOT ON. ",

Instead, they pumped me full of soda since preschool age and ignored my yellowed teeth until they were no longer allowed to, due to state health insurance requirements. They started taking me to a shitty dentist when I was about 15. \"Smiles for miles\" or something like that. They gave me a ton of those awful temporary fillings, never could get the novocaine right (I'd sit through drilling, feeling every bit), and worst of all told me I had plenty of room to let my wisdom teeth grow in.            \nNow in my adulthood my teeth have been nothing but troublesome. I've had fillings fall out, more decay, and now all four of my wisdom teeth are rotting out of my head since I can't reach them when I brush. I don't brush often enough anyway so I doubt they'd be much better if I could. I'm pregnant now, and my teeth are getting way worse. The pain is unbearable at this point. I've put off the dentist so much but I can't anymore and I'm scared of having to show anybody my teeth. I had a dentist look at a tooth last year and after the way he reacted (very judgmental and condescending) I couldn't make myself go back. I just took the antibiotics and called it good.             \nThis time around the antibiotics didn't help. I can't even lay my head down. I'm going to call the emergency dentist in the morning to have it taken out. It cannot wait any longer. I'm scared though. I'm scared of the pain, and I'm scared of the judgment.            \nI don't know what I'm looking to get out of posting this. I just really need to talk about this and my husband is sleeping. ",

I was raised by my mother and only met my father's family when I was already three years old. Until the age of 13 I visited my father and his family once or twice per year for a week or two - they lived on the other side of the country. He got married, got more children, build a house and wanted me to live with them so that I could be a part of his 'perfect family'. I was the black sheep of his family already for some time at this point, but this is when things got really nasty and I realized what a manipulative person he is and that he doesn't care about my well-being at all, that it's all about him. I went no contact. \n\nIt was not easy to go no contact, but I feel kind of lucky that I was able to go no contact at this young age, which would not have been possible if my parents would have lived together. \n\nStill, there are too many narcissists in my life. My current boss is the worst person I have ever met. And I left my former boss, because she was also pretty disordered. I met so many disordered people in my professional life, that I started to think it's the profession that attracts them, I'm a scientist BTW. I also had disordered teachers that bullied me at school. Not just that there are lots of narcissists in my life, but they also seem to feel especially threatend by me. They see me and start to fight me immediately. And I'm often the only person that sees them for what they are. It's just so frustrating. And I don't get how that is even possible. There is so obviously something wrong with this people, how can others not see this?\n\nAnd will it ever stop? Is there something like a narcissist-free life? I'm just so frustrated, it's like the world is full of narcissists and their enablers and there is no safe place for me. Is there something I can do to stay away from this kind of people? I'm seriously considering living in the woods or something, but I actually enjoy being part of society, interacting with other people and I like my job. ",

Im feeling a bit nervous but I keep reminding myself that I did not call out anyone in it, I did not blame anyone, I did not play the victim in it, nor did I whine or moan. Instead, I very professionally showed them what a bad-ass I am. lol. I pointed out specific deficits and how they conflicted with the messages I have been told. I also pointed out the missing context to the negative remarks and the fact that there was a major lack of examples of my positive successes and growth. I gave them some examples. Then I respectfully requested an amended review or that my rebuttal be attached to my review.\n\nIm kinda nervous of the response.I really don't want to get into a conversation about it. I just wanted it noted and to move on. Especially since baby girl can come at any point now (and may depending on test results....). But, bottom line is that I stood up for myself with out blaming anyone including myself. I played bad-ass woman victor instead of victim. Thanks for everyone's support!

We've both been working, but took our anniversary day off to just spend together.\n\nNmom wrote me at ~11.30 pm the day before - and my spider senses told me to check Facebook on my phone for any nasties so I wouldn't wake to them.\n\nHer initial message on Messenger was fine enough:\n\n\"Dear both - I'm not sure I'll be on tomorrow, so I just wanted to wish you an early happy anniversary. I so wish I could celebrate with you and give you hugs. Miss you both.\"\n\nIt triggered a lot of conversation between us, because my husband went on autopilot and wanted to respond with phrases like \"dear\" and \"we will have to look forward to the hugs\". So we talked a lot about my grey rock and how I need to just be short and concise, and that we shouldn't create a situation where he comes off as more approachable than me, seeing as he is already her GC.\n\nSo in the end, we both replied with a variety of \"thanks a lot. We'll make sure to have a great day. :)\"\n\nHer response?\n\n\"Oh, Tetusora is in the country? It's amazing what you don't know when you never hear anything.\"\n\nWe didn't reply.\n\nWe spent our anniversary in sweats and ate cake. He helped me wind a skein of yarn while we talked about how he sees her and me and what he would like for our future. And about how we want to get through things as a unit.\n\nThen we suited up and went to a fancy place to eat, and to play pool afterwards - the fanciest dressed at the pub.\n\nI didn't check my phone all afternoon and evening - but sure enough, the next day I saw that she had made a public post on her FB-wall, tagging us both with a picture of the four of us at our wedding and something like \"happy anniversary to my beautiful daughter and son-in-law. Miss you both.\"\n\nI didn't reply to that - only to a comment from a friend.\n\nAll in all, I am really proud: we turned a huge trigger-threat into a constructive day of getting closer and exploring our own feelings. I saw her behaviour for the Nsupply that it is, and didn't feel guilty for not replying to the egging on.\n\nAnd dinner was amazing.",

I looked it up online to see if it was worth calling the dr about. It could be this really serious thing called Cholestasis. It's basically when the liver stops absorbing bile and it builds up salt that goes into my blood stream and muscles causing the itchiness. No harm to me, but potentially fatal to the baby :( I've had a lot of bile issues the last month or so. So I'm freaked. Went to the dr today and they took some blood to test. I won't find out until Monday at the earliest. If it's positive, they have to deliver immediately. We planed on a c section no matter what, but it feels so soon. I still have 2.5 weeks left and a million things to do. And my toddler got diagnosed with strep today and has a fever. So I basically have the weekend to wrap up work stuff (&amp; my supervisor keeps forgetting to show compassion. She has her moments..) and finish prepping for the baby on top of all the other commitments we already have. \n\nIt's our last baby and pregnancy and I'm not ready to be done.

(Sorry if I'm being redundant, I know I posted some of this in comments.)\n\nI was in a very dark place, and from your posts I know that many of you are familiar with this place. I'm not completely in the light yet, but I'm starting to see a flicker and feel a bit more hope. This is largely due to the wonderful support that I received from all of you.\n\nI am extremely grateful that you all have been so constant, so compassionate, and so understanding while I've been in this place. I've realized how unique it is for me to feel not judged when I expose these rougher pieces of myself, and no one here was passing judgment. You all gave me many truths and some were hard to hear, but they were all important and none were critical. That is huge for me. I could feel the love and caring emanating from your comments which just kept coming and coming. You actually made me believe that I am not alone, that people care, and that maybe that I do matter.\n\nIn terms of my mental state, I no longer feel like offing myself (yay!) and I'm starting to care about things a bit more. It always takes me a bit to \"defrost\" when I have to put myself away like that, so I think this is normal.\n\nI was able to talk to my husband, explained my anger, was validated, and we have been able to reconnect. This is the other huge thing that has helped to pull me out. He is my best friend and biggest support and also a source of huge triggering for me. So having a problem with him is usually explosive (in my head) and really gets the catastrophizing and end-of-world feelings going (in case it wasn't obvious, I have Complex PTSD).\n\nAs for my therapist, you guys have given me a lot to think about. Maybe she isn't right for me anymore (which is terrifying and hard to admit). I'm taking a break from seeing her for a couple weeks to give myself some time to consider everything. I expect I will try to talk to her one more time and see if we can work this out. Other than that, I'm not really sure. I will keep you guys posted.\n\nThank you again for all of your kindnesses.

        "text": "So, I realise that I have never really been in a truly healthy relationship before. Before understanding about Narcissism I was horribly flea ridden and treated my exes quite badly. I was quite selfish and I never knew healthy ways of dealing with conflict and working through things so the relationships all ended in tears. \n\nMy current boyfriend and I have been together for seven years and overall our relationship is amazing. He was the first person to encourage me to stand up my parents and to not take the abuse anymore - which changed my world for the better in so many ways. He loves me as a person and he is so incredibly empowering. Over the last seven years I have created my dream job, established my independence and become so much more confidence - all with his encouragement and support. He truly is amazing - an honest, funny, kind and loving man that I would be thrilled to spend the rest of my life with. \n\nHowever, I'm still not 100% cleansed of my toxic upbringing. I still don't know how to deal with conflict very well or communicate clearly. When I get stressed or when things go wrong I find myself falling back on passive aggressiveness, anger and manipulation rather than being honest about how I feel. I've done and said really hurtful things to him and I don't always treat him with the love and kindness he deserves. I don't have good coping mechanisms for my emotions so I have just taken them out on him instead. \n\nHe is strong and forgiving and he understands why I act this way, but I can see that it still wears him down, frustrates him and hurts him. \n\nWe are both so tired of these unhealthy patterns that I keep repeating and I am determined to rid myself of them forever. I want to change and learn how to have a healthy relationship instead. I may be at a disadvantage because of my past, but I don't care. I still MUST try to break the cycle of abuse and learn to give love in a healthy way. I want him to feel deeply and profoundly safe, loved and happy. \n\nI learned about Love Languages a while ago and it was a huge \"lightbulb moment\" for me. The concept helped me understand and appreciate him on an entirely new level and improved our relationship so much! \n\n**I wanted to ask you guys to share any other resources that you have found helpful when it comes to learning how to have a healthy relationship when you have never really had one before. Also, if you can relate to this and you have any advice or stories from your own experience, that would be so helpful. Thanks so much for reading this and hugs to you all.**",

I told her some of the details of the bullying and shitty teachers that I kept from them and apologized for the attempted self destruction and scaring her so much. She apologized for not getting me tested for the learning disability that has become obvious as I moved into adulthood, as well as for not once thinking beyond her faith about my mental health and getting me to a therapist. She admitted that looking back, I was showing signs, just in a different way than my sister had. (Really, we were too broke for treatment until I became a teenager, and by then I wasn't the priority.) She admitted that I wasn't dumb or lazy, just showing signs of anxiety and ADD that everyone ignored because we Don't Talk About Feelings. That I had been used by a lot of people for their own devices - my father used me for nSupply and free manual labor, my siblings used me for free babysitting and courier services, schools used me for standardized test scores, and she was sad that I hadn't had a real, consistent friend in my life until I was 12 years old because of the bullying and small town BS. I wasn't loud about my problems, so it was easy to brush them off, especially in the world we lived in where disaster was around every corner...and that wasn't hyperbole. (Ranch life in a wild place is still hard, even if there's a smart phone in every cowboy's pocket now.)\n\nI didn't have the heart to argue about details. She might have enabled it up for the first 15 years of my life, but in the 15 since she's been a mama bear of the first order and I don't want to push her away. She admitted there were issues and she wasn't perfect. There were tears and hugs. I told her I wasn't mad, but it was nice to get the validation that I wasn't too sensitive to be part of my own family. \n\nI'm guessing we'll never speak of any of this again, and that's okay. That's part of why I'm writing this here. There was a day where my mother admitted that her and my father weren't perfect, and nobody can take that validation away from me now. It's a good feeling. Hoping I can hang on to it for as long as possible.",

        "text": "Hey all! I posted on here a few months ago about some huuuuuuuuuuge red flags I was seeing in my therapist, including her asking me to hang out with her socially, and treating me like a surrogate daughter. (https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/46viw6/having_some_misgivings_about_my_therapist/) \n\nWith your support on LAN, I realized I was in a codependent relationship with her, and I made the decision to cut ties. A couple of you asked for an update, so I wanted to share.\n\nI never looked back, and aside from feeling angry at her and somewhat taken advantage of, I have been doing really well. I've been ramping up the self-care in every way I know how, like going to the doctor, exercising, and taking it easy on myself when I need to. I also found a warm and accepting yoga studio that's close to my house. So now, instead of being fleeced by a faux therapist, I'm spending some of that money on yoga and saving the rest. I also got treatment for PMDD from my doctor, and the results have been really good.\n\nFor now, I'm holding off on finding a new therapist. My heart isn't in it. Maybe after I pay off my student loans in the next few years, I'll open that door again. I've had 8 therapists in the past 10 years. I spent a ton of money on things that didn't really help. I'm taking this opportunity to get to know myself better and really figure out what I want to work on for the future. \n\nThe most interesting part of this experience is that I feel actual self-esteem. It is liberating to detach from a bad influence, and damn, it feels good! \n\nalso, I am shocked to feel good because I forgot what it felt like. But hey, I could get used to this!",

He spends all his time playing computer games. When my daughter protests he does things like take away her cell phone. He took away her engagement ring and told her she'd get it back when she learned to behave. Oh, he's 21. He would call me in the middle of the night and ask me to control my daughter. He's gaslighting the hell out of her. She now thinks she needs antidepressants and that her temper is out of control. It's not. I'd chuck an Xbox across the room if I had to from with his shit too. She lives on chicken nuggets and hot pockets because she's scared to ask him for grocery money. Every time they fight, which is constantly, he tells her to get out of his house. He keeps her up all night with the computer game. The computer is in their bedroom. He won't put it in the living room, because there's no heat. When she asked him to turn off the computer so she can sleep, he tells her to go in the living room. I know it may not sound that bad...but the change in my daughter. I raised her to take no shit. And she didn't. She was always very independent. She'd just assume tell someone to f off if they got in her way. She was vibrant, funny, beautiful. Now, all she does is cry. She's meek. Her power is gone. I don't know what to do. Help please!",

She's not someone I'm close to but not someone I can avoid altogether. I've known her superficially for a while. \n\nAnyway, a really random conversation about names led to her asking what my maiden name is (as I mentioned disliking it). I said I'd rather not say because I am NC with my family and I feel strange about sharing it with people. I'm not sure why I even said that, but I did, and hindsight is a fine thing. \n\nIt's an unusual name. Rationally or irrationally, I feel very vulnerable if I share it with people I don't know well and trust. It's not that I necessarily think they'll try to intervene, more that it just doesn't feel okay to me.\n\nAnyway, this led to a conversation where she went from saying she \"knows how families are\" and telling me some stuff about her own family to asking me if, as my parents are getting older, I didn't need to-\n\nI cut her off and politely but firmly said if she was about to suggest I needed to make it right before I died then it wouldn't be welcome. \n\nShe said she just went for *me*. I said what I need for me is not to have toxic people in my life and that this isn't something I wish to discuss.\n\nI get why she said it. She has an Nmum by the sounds of it and her dad died suddenly and unexpectedly so she's no doubt projecting feelings about that onto me. But it's ticked me off. I feel frustrated and cross and just wanted to put that somewhere I guess.\n\n(I'm in the UK so FYI it's not Mother's Day here today!)",

I should probably start at the beginning. \n\nIm 17. My parents got a divorce or at least started divorce proceedings when I was three. I couldnt really remember anything up to age 8 when i was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. It was taken out and i turned out fine to my future dismay. My parents probably had spent the most time with each other in that hospital. I remember although grainilly, them reconciling at my illness. Tbh, I was kinda drugged out at the time. \n\nFast forward to 2 years later, and here I am going to court with my mother, her taking me by the hand to court proceedings. I was barred or at least discouraged from seeing my father at the time. I remember my mother becoming erratic whenever my dad picked me up to go anywhere. I needed to ask her permission first or something like that. Its all very hazy to me. \n\nBasically, she had somehow shielded me from my father and she was now in full custody of me until now at age 17.\n\nI dont know if its denial syndrome or stockholm syndrome or what but I cant seem to admit to the fact that she was a horrible mother. I should add that my brother and her siblings had abandoned her long ago. She use to cut me with butter knives, throw things at me and she still emotionally maltreats me. I was exposed to a convicted sexual molester and was kind of groped by him at around 15. Ive managed to suppress my sadness but depression has taken hold. Im fine but sometimes i just get sad i guess. \n\nMy dad had a child out of wedlock and lied to me about it when i was about 11. Hes married now and has a family with another woman. Hes pretty good for the most part and pays for me. I am endlessly grateful for that. \n\nMy mother regularly guilt trips,nags,annoys, and scolds me for the most inconseqential shit on a daily basis. Im leaving soon but would just like to know how I should go about cutting ties. ive been called selfish, lazy, good for nothing and undeserving for too long. Its honestly so strange for me to see people happy and in loving relationships because thats never been my experience. I envy/disbelieve their reality. please help me start to lead a normal life. am planning to leave her soonfor my alevels/preuni\n\nshes also batshit bipolar crazy. oneminute shes pissed at me and the next she wants to go have ice cream and watch a movie.\n\nany response is greatly appreciated",

        "text": "My son is 3 and we have baby girl due this month! I've always been a little weird around holidays because of my nfamily. I get squirrelly-which I know is a common ACoN thing. The first year of being NC was the hardest around holidays. Ever since I had my son, I am always reminded of this one particular memory around Mother's Day. \n\nWhen I was probably in 5th/6th/maybe 7th grade (I remember by where we lived not age! Haha!) my nfather give us some money and took us to Walmart to go shopping for my mom for Mother's Day. This was the first time we had been responsible for choosing the gifts ourself. (&amp; a week before I had asked my n/emother for some cash to get her something at the library bookstore. I think I bought stickers with the two dollars she gave me). So we are at Walmart and there was nothing I could think of or find that fit the money my nfather give us (I don't remember the time amount but probably under $20). As I was walking around by myself, I came across a juice pitcher. I thought \"my mom likes juice. I'll get her this!\" I was super proud of myself. I go and buy it and meet up with my nfather. I show him what I chose- I was so proud and he exploded at me. Grabbed my by the arm and made me return it. He \"lectured\" me and belittled me while we went back around the store. I showed him this Nivea kit that I had considered-it had lotions and stuff in it and I knew my mom liked their lip gloss-but I told him I hadn't been sure because there was other stuff in it besides the lip gloss that I wasn't sure she would like. And I couldn't decide between the two kits (&amp; didn't have enough for both). We ended up buying both and he kept going on about how I should have just asked for more money, how stupid I was, how inconsiderate and thoughtless. I was in tears. This started with then I showed him the pitcher and didn't end until we got home. He even brought up the fact that I asked my mom for money earlier in the week to buy her stickers. \"She doesn't want stickers! Or a pitcher!\" He went on and on about how gifts should be given and basically what an ungrateful twit I was for picking out a pitcher when my n/e mother has done so much for me. I was crushed. My mother eventually got wind of this when we got home and I remember her saying to me \"I would have liked a pitcher bc it was from you\". Idk if that's true. But all she did was tell my nfather to stop but the damage was done. \n\nFast forward to Mother's Day and she opened up the two Nivea kits and oooh'd and awwww'd appropriately. I heard her tell my nfather later (or maybe I asked her?) that she did love the lipgloss but didn't need all the rest of the kits. So I failed again. Ever since then, gift giving is super difficult for me bc I have to make it mean something huge. Gift receiving is even harder. I have other memories of trying to shop for my mom for either her bday or holiday and about to buy her a lipstick i thought she'd like bc I liked it (I was in hs) and she stopped me while I was talking to the Clinique later. I think we ended up buying her one of those kitschy mom necklaces and she didn't ever wear it. \n\nNow that I'm a mother, I always think about this come Mother's Day. I've explicitly told my husband I never want one of those #1 mom necklaces because I'd never wear it and I'd hate for my kids to feel the same way I did when I got my mom one. (And honestly, if they did get me one, I would wear it occasionally). But I've loved every homemade gift my son has made me and my husband always goes above and beyond to make me feel loved on Mother's Day, my broth day, and Christmas. He's a good man. Thankfully this memory doesn't trigger me but I do remember it every Mother's Day and have a slight, existential panic and then remember I don't live in that world any more. It's a relief. Still working on the holiday weirdness and gift giving weirdness. ",

If he went to a particular movie or other social event, so did I. There was this massive reinforcement that we had to do everything together. There were a few times I was able to make individual choices but only as an extension of a joint choice previously made (such as continuing on in a youth organization when my GC twin had left). Personal preference didn't matter, at least from my end. When I got out of my Nmom's house and away from my twin and started pursuing my own identity/interests there was massive backlash. \"Why are you into combat martial arts? Are you suicidal? Don't you know what that will do to me?\" ARRRGGHHH!! \n\nRealization of all this crap and moving beyond it is the hardest thing I have ever had to do now that the C-PTSD and depression are lifting.

Being the GC, he doesn't get that our mum is a N, but other than that he has mostly been supportive when I have been through hard times. We played a lot together as children and still have many in-jokes from that time.\n\nYesterday, I broke up with my serious girlfriend of 8 months. It was a mostly good relationship, and I agonised for weeks over the decision. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that our lives are heading in separate directions. She is a stonewaller and is about to start therapy to deal with that. After several months of arguing and silence following the honeymoon period, I need to end the relationship and focus on building my own self-esteem. Another major factor was that my career will be taking me to a different country in 9 months' time, and she neither understands my decision nor wants to come with me. She is still studying and I completely understand that she doesn't want to break that off. The relationship has become a stonewall-fest in which I can't talk about my major career goals without judgment or a sense that my moving away will be the end of the relationship. I feel that it is holding me back from my personal growth and rebuilding following N abuse.\n\nToday, I messaged my brother. I sent him a very long message saying everything that I told my girlfriend yesterday. He responded briefly and cooly that he would have time for me after his university exams finish at the end of May. I have been happy to give him some space lately to work and understand that he cannot always be available, but it blows my mind that he is not able to spend an hour talking to me about the end of a major relationship. Worse, he recently started a self-development blog where he preaches about the value of unconditional love, mental health awareness and self-development. I checked the Facebook page and he has been posting every day. The hypocrisy blows my mind. \n\nI confronted him about it just now and he was evasive, lecturing and accusing me of playing the victim. Excuse me? Playing the victim? Really? I've just taken extremely painful action to end an ok, but ultimately incompatible relationship and that makes me a victim? I just took action to reach out to him (and 5-6 other good friends) and that makes me a victim? I'm running my own business and have taken myself to therapy and that makes me a victim? Very angry right now. I'm sick of having my needs invalidated by family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "*Light pretext: I have a hard time with maintaining fluidity and direction in my writing so please bare with me. I try my hardest. Thank you.*\n\n\nIn the past few years I've absorbed more of what \"fleas\" are, how I've been affected, etc. But even until recently I see certain mannerisms and behaviors- things I've said and done, usually little- and I kick myself for them thinking, \"Wow, I'm a dumbass... Such-and-so must think I'm desperate for attention/sad/irritating/an absolute jerk/stupid...\" \n\n\nFor example, the other day I ordered a drink (coffee) with a friend and got mine before her. The cashier mentioned the drink being delicious and I awkwardly and shyly said, \"Yeah, I'm, like, enjoying it...\" She gracefully paused in confusion but smiled and nodded, ugh, bless her. Anyhow, I frequently make small off-comments like that and I get stressed because I know how dull I might seem to others... I know it's me being dissociative to cope with being anxious and too many things happening around me. On another occasion long ago, a friend told me that with the purchase of her ring she got free ring cleanings. I said I felt ring cleanings were unnecessary and you could do them yourself at home... She agreed, but later I realized not only was that beside the point she was trying to make but was rude to even say. In my mind at the time, though, I was being helpful. \n\n\nI do try to be easy on myself by looking back on how far I've come but then the sense of shame and embarrassment comes in and I go into a downward spiral thinking about how others might look at me for my slip-ups... I know I'll catch up with emotional and behavioral development overtime, but I'm seeking to just pick myself up instead of getting lost on, \"Oh man, I can't believe I said/did that... I must have seemed so weird :(\" I've long fought the habit of second-guessing myself (I'm sure you have, too) and I will sit at night reaching into memory for something I said or did so I can beat myself up for it. I'm quiet for the most part now because I'm scared I'll say or do something ignorant (in general or of the situation) and to stave off having regret later. How have you dealt with times like this?",

        "text": "I have been trying to get over this need to make sure that every little bit of food I own is eaten, that nothing goes bad, and nothing is wasted or thrown away. For a long time I thought it was a good thing (I don't tend to buy as much, I don't have vegetables rotting in my fridge drawers) but....\n\nIt's also a bad thing (due to coming with the thought that I \"HAVE TO\" eat something....\"HAVE TO\" finish this or that...)\n\nI have been working to get over this (through affirmations and following a food plan) and have lost 10 lbs already!!! \n\nBut I'm wondering....does anyone have any insight or experience with something like this? Why does this tendency come about? Why could it be so extreme? \n\nOne sort of silly example is in Jr.High school I used to take oranges that came with my lunch, but that I didn't feel like eating, and store them in the top of my shared locker. My locker partner wasn't too happy about it, because sometimes they'd get mold.\n\nAnd in more recent years I'd almost spaz if any foods got wasted at all, cringing if I had to throw out the last half of a zucchini that got soft for example...after first looking at it and thinking \"There has to be something I can cook this in\"\n\nI remember my OCD Nstep-dad would say this food is HIS, and scream bloody murder if anyone touched HIS food (of course we wouldn't really know what was his and what wasn't)\nand \nI remember my Nstep-mom berating me for wanting to become vegetarian (telling me that's stupid....even though being vegan currently has gotten rid of ALL of my stomach issues)\nand\nI remember in high school taking pickles off the condiment cart for lunch just so I could save my lunch $$ to buy cigarettes.\n\nSo it's probably some sort of thing that helped me feel in control. \nStrange food tendencies. \n\nEven now I feel myself needing to control what comes into the house, for fear of it not being eaten. When I'm in the store with my husband I'm telling him the entire time \"Let's leave. Let's leave. We're getting too much. It won't be eaten.\" It's a fear...I'd love to get rid of... but I don't even know what getting rid of it would look like? I picture it will look like a fridge full of rot.",

Well, some of them, for a minute...\n\nWhat I do is when I hear them I say \"NO! I'm doing it the way I want to do it, and that way is awesome. It's the best!\" basically I tell the thought \"NO\"...(I also like to hold out my hand, wave it hard and say uh uh!) and then enter an affirmation about how I'm doing it the way I know best, and that way works best for me. \n\nSo, one day I was doing the dishes and no voice popped up! So I rejoiced :) and then I was mowing the lawn and no voice popped up! Again, I rejoiced. :)\n\nUntil of course I talked to my mom on the phone, and wham, now new memories have creeped in and here I am again having to say \"Noooo.....I'm doing it awesome!\" (Something I never got the opportunity to do as a child, due to fear of extreme reprimand) :(\n\nBut now, as I like to say \"I'm a grown-ass man\" :) So I can at least know I am NOT in those situations any longer. I have a place of my own, my own lawn, my own dishwasher....etc. \n\nAnd I know that my technique to chase away those voices works, along with my techniques to keep my house looking it's best.",

        "text": "I'd appreciate any advice/support anyone can offer.\n\nI'm 24/f and just now drew some solid boundaries with my NDad. He and my Emom are divorcing after 30+ years of a tortured marriage and upbringing. I picked up a lot of enabling behavior from my EMom because it made life easier than picking fights over all of my behaviors that NDad didn't like. As such, I essentially learned how to be invisible in a household. I also have lots of discomfort when it comes to being ignored because my NDad and NGrandparents favored the method of ignoring me as punishment for doing anything they didn't approve of (in the case of my NGrandparents, it was being mixed race and existing at all).  \n\nLate last fall I finally found a full-time job that would allow me to move out and get on my feet financially. I live in a very high cost of living area and found a room in a 3 bedroom apartment with 2 other single girls slightly older than me.\n\nI'm now fairly certain the roommate who's lived here the longest is a narcissist, or at least has some strong FLEAS. We had a heart-to-heart shortly after I moved in last year and she shared a similar life story to mine: abusive and violent father, same ethnicity as mine, and also went NC after graduating college. I thought this would bring us closer together but her behavior is triggering very uncomfortable feelings for me.\n\nShe has no sense of boundaries whatsoever and treats my and the other housemate's belongings like they're hers (and she trashes her stuff). Until I installed a lock on my door, she'd go into my room without permission. I can't install a lock on my food in the shared fridge, so she takes my food without asking. We've had at least 3 confrontations about this with her always promising to ask before she takes things and then repeating the cycle a few weeks later. Just this past weekend alone, she admitted to me that she ate my frozen pizza, all of my fruit, the whole packet of my shredded cheese, and drank all 6 beers I was slowly rationing for myself because her friends came over Saturday morning while I was at my second job and she didn't feel like going to the store. This, plus she left a massive mess with sauce and oil spattered everywhere and didn't clean it up until Monday night. In a few days she'll probably try to earn forgiveness (again) by doing what she always does -- buy me a large quantity of one ingredient that she took, and then ask me why I couldn't consume all of it before it went bad. \n\nShe exhausts me in so many ways. Whenever she wants to talk (usually for dating advice), she doesn't stop asking me questions until she gets an answer she wants to hear. Otherwise she completely ignores me and doesn't even acknowledge my presence when I greet her. \n\nI'm at my wit's end. I'm struggling financially and have stopped buying the perishable food that I like and is healthy for me because my NRoommate continues to steal it and I can't afford to buy more. I'd rather live off of the bread and peanut butter I can hide in my room than be hungry because my fruit and lunch meats are always gone. I can't afford a mini fridge for my room. I feel like I'm going crazy and falling into another N cycle. My saving grace is that I'm moving out in August. What do I do to survive until then?",

She could act like she was eager for my advice in private or compliment something I did but it was way different publicly. I understand why narcs do what they do, and this is only the tip of the iceberg with her, but it still just hurts even after two years NC.

My co-workers like me. My boss likes me. The customers absolutely love me. It's like a completely different situation than my previous job where I was just falling apart and getting more more depressed and stressed out.\n\nBut then my counselor told me that I shouldn't be working more than 5 days a week and she warned me against wearing myself thin. She told me that it's very important for my mental health. I'm recovering from depression and a lot of c-ptsd.\n\nWhen I told my manager that I needed 5 days of working and two days off in a row, she told me that here we work 6 days a week. I didn't know about this when I first got hired. I got a job offer from a different place that was offering me 25 hours a a week. I refused it in lieu of this being full-time. And because I enjoyed the environment here.\n\nI had one day off this week. And then I had a 10-hour shift. And now I'm working 6 more days. So that's 7 days in a row. I'm still extremely behind on all my bills. At least $1,000 that I still owe and is overdue.\n\nAnd I'm so exhausted. I try to nap after work but I have to cook dinner for us because my mom is working and my brother needs food. And then I try to nap and my brother spends the whole time playing on his drums so it's impossible and I become just a fucking zombie after work and I don't get anything else done whatsoever.\n\nAnd honestly, I've stopped taking care of myself. This last year of unemployment I learned skills on how to take care of myself so that my mental health and my physical health is optimal. Most days I'm still exhausted from my job and I don't have the energy to figure out what I need to do to keep myself healthy or how to keep my emotions at bay. My third day in a row working this week and today I'm just over filled with rage. It's a symptom that my depression is getting in the way again. I just don't know what to do. I don't have the resilience of most people my age.\n",

        "text": "**mom is stepmom, not birthmother, who I have been Nc With for over a year.**\n\n\nHey LAN. I recently went overseas to Italy for a week with my family. Super exciting. Dad even paid for everything ans compensated me for the wages I would lose. Amazing. I felt anxious though. Italy is full of wine, and my dad and his mother are angry drunks, and alcoholics. \n\nI also have a severe allergy to cheese. I am lactose intolerant on top of that, but it is very minor, and I usually ignore it. Something used to make cheese closes my throat up. It's not severe enough to go to the hospital so my family believes it's psychological. And that is in damn near every Italian dish. My friends and coworkers reminded me this almost every day leading up to it. I was anxious, but the only way to back out was to xancel the god knows how expensive tickets. So I went.\n\nAside from some stress induced disagreements, which is normal, everything was well. Well, to further spoil us, dad hired a professional chef to come to the place and cook. It was legit.\n\nWell, we went to a winery earlier. I didnt realize how many bottles were bought.\n\nIt was an hour or so before, and my anxiety kept ramping up, since the menu was solely up to her. I asked dad about it. Instead of saying something along the lines of \"Ill mention it to her,\" He told me \"well. I am keeping an open mind. So I at least will try everything.\"\n\nSo I tried talking to my mom. It got a little heated, and I started getting childish. Instead of continuing down this road I knew would end in me completely losing my shit, I told her, \"see, this is why I am upset. I cant eat cheese and never have, you know that!\" She continued, and I did what I felt was the best decision. \n\nI picked up my stuff and left, without saying a word. \n\nWell, that apparently was *not* the right thing to do. Mom followed me up and told me she wanted to talk. She sad I was being dramatic, and made an unnecessary show. I told her I felt like she had been riding my ass, bringing up some of our disagreements. My argument wasnt sufficient, and everything was blown out of porportion, or it was fueled by an onery toddler. She told me she doesnt get why I talk so much (when I get anxious, like I was almost the whole trip, I reason with myself and do my decision making by talking to myself), and how annoying it was since I already live on Facebook. I told her the anxiety thing, and that my great-aunt does more on there than me. She conceded on the FB thing, but told me the talking thing was just weird. I shut down, and just told her \"well Im fucked up in the head, its going to happen.\" She told me shes tired of my martyr act, and that I was choosing to be miserable. I said fine, let me be miserable then. She said do what you want and left.\n\nSo heres the thing. Whenever theres a disagreement with mom, there's a shouting match with dad soon after. My anxiety skyrocketed. I have no way to talk to my support system, as internation phone plans are insanely expensive, and the wifi cut in and out frequently.\n\n30 minutes and 4 bottles of wine in, by my estimate of the family drinking, dad sure enough stormed up.\n\n\"Youre in Italy.\" i confirmed that, yes, we were in italy. \"And you're going to let CHEESE ruin it!\" I try to explain to him that its the fact they keep forgetting the allergy despite how long ita been a thing, but he begins to yell at me about how he has meticulously planned this trip, and god forbid he forgets one detail. He remembered to mention his dislike of seafood of her, though, of course. I begin to yell back at him. He yells back. Guilt trip guilt trip. He calls me a child, and I tell him to just leave me the hell alone to calm down. He angrily complies.\n\nI think another hour passes. I dont know. I read and attempt a nap. In thr middle of my attempted nap, my good grandmother, lets call her Cat, comes up. Cat sits on the bed, and says the chef is here and everyone would like me to come down. I tell her Im not up to it. She asks if its the cheese thing. I try to telk her its not just cheese, and the whole forgetting this thing, but then the very drunk grandma, lets call her Pat, barges in, and throws the sheets off of me and screams that my pity party is done and get downstairs. I get angry, done witb this drunken shit, and tell her Ill damn well stay up here. She screams to stop acting like a 12 year old. I tell her to stop yelling at me, and Cat tries to say shes not yelling, trying to calm down the situation, but Pat interrupts saying that she is, in fact, yelling at me becausw Im behaving like a 12 year old spoiled brat. This is the same woman who criticizes every single aspect of my life and has literally told me she worries about me having a reserved seat in hell. So yeah. Im not too fond of her. And this was my last straw with her. I told her to \"fucking leave me alone\" and that Ill just be a 12 year old by myself up here. She yells that Im lying abouy yhe cheese allergy, as lactose affects the gut. I scream at her that i have an allergy to something in the cheese, to which she replies ITS JUST MILK. NOTHING ELSE. I had enough. Before another family member could come up, I storm out and lock myself in the bathroom. I give myself 10 minutes or so to calm down.\n\nI return to Cat. She tells me Pat is out of line, and I ask to talk to dad, hoping to try and reason with him. Im crying at this point. I feel horrible. I begin to chastise myself for being adamant about staying upstairs. He comes up, and I tell him I am very grateful that hes done all this. I really am. I however didnt like being yelled at. He raises his voice. By the family drinking calculations, we are probably on bottle 7 at this point. And this is potent wine, 13-15 percent. My mother was NOT yelling at you. SHE FUCKING ADMITTED IT DAD. He tells me adults need a kick in the ass. I tell him I have a hsrd time with my psych conditions, and almost dig a knife in with yhe suicide attemot, when mom comes up. Shes very quiet. I havent seen her like this since telling us she had breast cancer. She tears up and just says \"can we please. can we just have dinner together and pretend we are happy.\"\n\nWell, damn. I immediately calm down, since this woman has been the one family member that I feel like I have a healthy relationshop with, despite our neuroticism clashes. I tell her I will clean up and go downstairs.\n\nWell, when in rome...well, florence, but oh well. I chug a glass of wine. Dad comes up and tells me thanks. I look at him, numbing myself,  say \"I just needed the family to so nicely remind me how much of a selfish 12 year old I am, thank you.\" I down another glass. He looks upset as he walks off but says nothing.\n\nPat comes up on glass 3. She give me a hug. I dont return it. She tells me \"you may be mad at me but I still love you. Be mad all you want but youre still my *only* granddaughter.\" I stare at her. She rolls her eyes and walks off.\n\nBottle after bottle after bottle. Pat and Dad are absolutely gone, dancing and being emotional, and Im drunk and numb. \n\n11 bottles finishes the dinner. Besides one plate sneaking ricotta, which I figured out by literally not being able to get it down my throat, all was generally okay. The inevitable yelling between dad and pat about politics occurred. Typical family dinner. \n\nIt is now 1030. Mom stays behind, and we talk. It is a very good talk, and we finally get some true communication. I agree that I should have been more clear about being overwhelmed, and she apologized for the drunken behavior. All is well. \n\nExcept I share a bedroom with Pat. Well, shes passed out drunk, so, no worries Im sure. Except shes locked me out. I roll my eyes. Mom knocka on the door to, surprise, no response. I tell her I will just sleep on the couch, that I dont care where I sleep as long as I ger to sleep. Well somehow this wakes up the beast. Dad comes out and slurs about whats going on. We tell him. he slams his fist on the door telling Pat to wake up. She does, and says something to the effect of, \"who are you again, and why would you want to come in here?\" I repeat that Ill just stay on the vouch. its after midnight and bed is calling to my drunk brain. dad isnot having it. he grabs my pollow and blanket and rushes me to my side of the bed. he tries to charge my phone; im sharing one with Pat. he asks repeatedly where it is to which she agitatedly responds Im using it. He stumbles to his room and grabs me one. I took it as an apology for earlier.\n\nI have yet to get one from Pat.\n\nI know I have anger issues and I still have a long way to go in therapy. My anxiety sucks. I dont think an alcoholic family really helps. Or days of forgetting about the cheeae thing and taking us to pizza places with literally only pizza.",

I have observed this, especially with teachers, crossing guards, librarians, etc. --- if they were normal balanced people, this subtle indicator either wasn't given or was rejected. However, if the adult was 'not a nice person' they understood that there would be no repercussions for harsh and demeaning behavior.\nJust not sure how this lack of caring was conveyed. Had an experience while with my mother where an adult really was out of order, but my mother did nothing to correct the adult. Other instances where a 'bad teacher' ( I want to note I had many wonderful teachers who saved my life) knew no one would be calling them if they were 'mean' to students whose parents didn't care, but 'behaved' if the students parents were attentive.",

But now I'm not sure, for two reasons:\n\n1. I've been working through some very difficult stuff recently and making links between the present and the past. So my therapist thinks I'm ready to process difficult things.\n\n2. I read a book that said it's not actually necessary to revisit the trauma. This feels like a relief to me. There's much I can't remember of growing up and I don't want to dredge up old things if I don't have to. The same patterns play out in my adult life so if I can process these now, I can learn what I missed the first time without having to revisit the first time.\n\nSo basically, I really don't know what to tell my therapist next session. What ideas I'm supposed to give her for a plan. \n\nI know this is very personalised but what sort of plans do other people work to?",

I just hung out with a couple I've known from our previous state today and turns out the wife has some serious major mental malfunction and is definitely N to boot. They invited me to go on a trip with them. I'm pretty sure it's fairly normal for those who thought of going on the trip to have done some preliminary research on the place. They didn't. They also know I don't have a ton of money to blow in an expensive town, which is what this turned out to be. \n\nSo I brought up that I wasn't going to get food in the town because it is not affordable for me. I told them they could get food if they wanted and I would hang out. Queue her completely throwing a raging fit out of nowhere, claiming I was accusing her of this place being too expensive (what) and that I was attacking HER with what I had said, and went ON AND ON AND ON, then threatened to kick me out of the car, then called me names in the car, then tried to turn it all around on me by saying I'm horribly damaged and that I need to deal with whatever is causing me to behave like an insane person (total projection and she also has no idea I come from an abusive background so this was so out of left field), then DID kick me out of the car then came back (I only got in because we are in an area where there really is no possible way to get around with public transportation including taxis). \n\nThen I got my stuff from their place that I had dropped off before we went and she attempted to stop me from leaving their place by blocking the door just like the typical N. I told her that not allowing me to leave the place is illegal and that I will have to call the cops, so she went totally psycho and tried to beat me up and was acting with such insanity that her husband pretty much had to throw her into the wall AND tackle her. \n\nWhere was he during all of this? Either being totally submissive or an enabler until he realized she was going to go to jail for her actions if she succeeded in them. And it isn't like I don't know him well. This is somebody I had been able to definitely call a friend in the past. And THIS is why I am done. It's not even strangers, it's people I've known fairly well get together with Ns and let them run rampant, encouraging their behavior to get worse, then allow it to be unleashed upon me. \n\nI am fairly certain that I have semi-confirmed PTSD (I had seen an intern counselor who was pretty sure but unable to diagnose for sure because he was an intern) and this has been a massive trigger all around. I had a huge meltdown while driving home then just really shut off and am so incredibly jumpy right now and don't want anybody around me. ",

My grandparents were extremely dysfunctional people but one of the few constants in a chaotic childhood.\n\nMy sister and I talked for a long time about many things including our father's side of the family (the one with the recently passed aunt and the other aunt who is dying, that I have posted about).  That side of the family is off-the-charts dysfunctional, but my sister keeps up with their goings-on.  We actually talked a bit about how dysfunctional they all are!  Like how our cousins, who we really don't even know, have distanced themselves from their parents just to save themselves.  Which of course is very familiar and makes complete sense to me.  So, there was a little bit of validation there.\n\nAnd my sister suggested that I come visit her and my nieces this summer!  I probably will because I'm not working now so I have time and it seems like it will be a healthy thing to do.  \n\nI have a bunch of emotions right now but I do feel less lonely, which is nice.\n\nETA: My sister just called and my grandmother passed away this afternoon.",

Head is in the correct position and I'm already .5cm dilated. They say I'm right on track and everything looks good. I'm having a c section either way, but I think I'll have them check weekly just because I find the information interesting. I've had some swelling of my feet but otherwise I'm just very pregnant. Lol\n\nWe had lunch with my MIL and finally got to talk to her about after birth plans. I'm the planner in the family. Her and my husband aren't as much lol but she did reveal that she's already taken a week off from work to \"help us in anyway needed.\" So we talked about her staying with us the first week and I told her that would be a great comfort. I can't drive or pick anything up heavier than the baby for two weeks &amp; my husband can only take a week off. So I'm worried about what we are gonna do for \"coverage/support\" for the first two weeks. But it's helpful to know what our plans are for the night before the scheduled c section and the week or so after. My MIL will watch my son the whole time until we can all come home. \n\nSo we're thinking she'll stay with me the first week &amp; my husband will go to work (except the day of the birth of course) &amp; then he'll take the second week off when his mom goes home. It's a workable solution. My hubs is gonna talk to his boss and see what he can do. He says his boss has told him that he'd work with him. So that's coming together. \n\nWe finally got our tax return and I was able to buy the last few things we need for the baby. Hopefully my aunt &amp; grandma will come through with the fancy monitors lol. So hopefully by next weekend, the nursery will finally be done. The in between status of everything has been giving me anxiety and driving me nuts. Getting things done is helping greatly. Especially knowing what my MIL is doing to help. \n\nSo there's my update :) i appreciate all the love and support !",

And my best friend suffers long term amnesia, so I've recently had a conversation that literally started with the phrase \"can you tell me how we met and go from there?\".\n\nAt the same time, I've had to account for him that I've had my eyes opened to the fact that I've suffered gaslighting and chronic mental abuse my whole life, so that my memory and I aren't exactly on the best of terms.\n\nNeedless to say, I'm exhausted.\nAnd then at the same time, invigorated: a friend sent me an advert for an open PhD position at the uni my husband studies at, and it sent me spiralling into all sorts of directions.\n\nI made plans, when I was 14: study hard, get to study abroad, obtain bachelors, masters and PhD degree, work in international company - be badass in an objectively, measurable manner.\nI think it stems from wanting approval: if I have these notches on my belt, parents will HAVE to approve of me, right? Right.\n\nSo here I am: PhD available. And the though of applying sent me into the strongest sense of anxiety and bunched up holy-shit-I-want-to-vomit-shivers that I have felt since I was literally diagnosed with stress, nearly two years ago.\n\nI didn't want it. I don't. I don't want to enter academia and vie for tenure and have to continuously balance teaching and researching and fund sourcing. \nBut I've wanted it for half my life! \n\nAnd it felt so weird, suddenly realising that I am echoing wishes that aren't real ones anymore. It's been a lifeline, an identity: Tetusora, the smart one, wants to become a professor. \n\nAnd here I am, not wanting it. What the?\nMy husband asked me what makes it still even a little viable for me, and I said teaching under grads. So the conversation led to me considering teaching college/high school/upper secondary (there, that should cover any international dialect).\n\nSo I've sent an application for that, seeing if these institutions will even have me.\nAnd at the same time, these past few weeks, I have literally had these experiences with almost anything:\n\nDo I like this type of clothes because I was told that I did?\nDo I pursue this hobby because I've been told I should?\nDo I constantly flog myself for not doing anything \"productive\" on my weekend for fear of appearing lazy?\n\nIt's messy. And good. And messy.\nI feel like I have the chance to get to know myself, aged nearly 30. And at the same time, I feel lost and awkward at having to get to know myself.\n\nIs this normal?

As with most typical N's and their daughters, she competed with me a lot, preyed on my insecurities, and didn't teach me a lot of grooming basics.\n\nI went No Contact three years ago and it's been a really good thing for myself and growth. One thing I've noticed, is that I can't really help but seek out maternal figures, be that in friends or authority figures like professors. For the most part, it's unconscious and then when I become aware of it, I feel awkward for projecting on people. :/\n\nI joined a Panhellenic sorority for a while, looking for solidarity among aspiring women and kind of looking for a good role model and such. It was a decent experience but overall I felt like I just had too many personal issues to be completely comfortable with it. I'm hypersensitive to passive aggression and while I know it can be meant well, I still found myself upset over the lack of direct communication. I know it's not an ideal world and I wish I had stuck with the sorority a little longer, but I've since moved away.\n\nI'm taking some months off from school to work on my mental health and I can't help but feel very aware about lacking proper maternal figures / female role models in my life. I hate it, I feel like an awkward mess at my core and I know it's best to try and be that woman for myself -- see myself as my own mother and such but that just makes me feel really lonely and sad.\n\nI guess I'm just looking to hear that I'm not alone in feeling like this or even alone in having sought out a sisterhood. Where can I find a surrogate mother? Hahahahahahasob. (Humor is the best coping mechanism)\n",

I thought I was perfectly fine after going NC, but even though it probably looks like that from the outside I've discovered I'm actually not as okay as I thought.\n\nThe first is that, like him, I am a liar by nature. I try to control it but it comes so naturally, at the moment I get it out by lying to protect my friend from spoilers in a game he's going through but once he finishes it I don't know what I'm gonna do. I *never* mean to be malicious in my lies like Ndad, but I can recognise I'm pulling the same tricks he does. I can and will casually lie even in situations where it is entirely unnecessary to do so. How do you deal with realising you've picked up bad habits from Nparents?\n\nThe other is I accepted going NC with no emotional struggle at all. I cut him out of my life so easily, and that actually concerns me. Because of Ndad's work I was moved around constantly, I'm currently 18 and living in my 15th place of residence. I got so used to saying goodbye, and he always made it seem like you could just do that. Break off relationships with people easily, and so I've done that. Now I'm not even sure how to go about starting friendships. I can make small talk but it always ends awkwardly because I don't know how to do all those little things, like make it outwardly seem like I care about what a person is saying whether I do or don't internally. I can sit at a table surrounded by people but feel like I'm trapped in a glass box. I can see them but I can't really interact with them. Once you escape from an N how do you start over? Especially when you don't really share interests with the people around you?\n\nThanks.",

        "text": "The past few weeks haven’t been especially difficult. There are the usual daily struggles mostly because I have a very intense three-year-old, but nothing really noteworthy. Mostly, I feel like I’m doing ok, functioning, even having some good times. But I feel like I’m watching someone else living my life because inside I feel kind of dead, kind of hollow, and wounded. I do have a history of dissociation (PTSD), so I wonder if this is a new side of that disconnect.\n\nI’ve come to a point in my therapy/recovery where I am mostly aware of my coping mechanisms and cognizant of many of the thoughts that go through my head during the day. But I don’t yet feel like I have much control over them or ways to deal with the disturbing things that come up. Recently I’ve become aware of a huge pool of grief. I know it’s there, sometimes I can see it, occasionally I can feel it, but I can’t cry.\n\nIn therapy this week we discussed how I can touch the grief and my therapist encouraged me to let some of it out. Immediately, I heard a scream in my head, “She means for you to cry in front of her!” And then, of it’s own accord, everything completely shut down. I could actually hear the gates clang closed, the iron vault was locked, and the prison bars came down. I saw myself on the outside, holding the bars and looking at emptiness because even the vault door had disintegrated. And I felt nothing. The sadness was gone, the pool had disappeared, there was only a flat grayness left. It took a lot for me to come out of that because everything in me wanted to shut down too, just take a little break in dissociation. Instead, I looked up at my therapist and was able to tell her “It’s like Fort Knox in here.”\n\nI came away from that session feeling really broken. I desperately *want* to let some of this grief out, but I can’t do it. I especially can’t do it in front of people and I’m rarely ever alone (three-year-old). Even if I plan for some alone time, I find myself filling it with work and household tasks, anything to avoid touching that big wound. It hurts in a nauseating way.\n\nAnyway, so I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this feeling of being fully functional, happy, laughing even, on the outside, but falling to pieces on the inside. Is there anything to do about this? Is it a sign of progress? Regression? Do you have any suggestions for relief?\n\nThanks a lot and hope everyone is having a nice Friday/weekend.",

        "text": "I gave up on my therapist yesterday. I was feeling bad anyway and I started talking about something in my childhood that had really upset me and got to that point of feeling helpless where they say something helpful can happen if you're with the right person. Her phone buzzer had already gone off twice and at this point the doorbell rang and she actually got up to answer it. I'm feeling angry about it now as I write. She saw I was irritated and asked me why. I told her and she asked me whether I understood that these things couldn't be ignored and that there were psychiatrists who answered the phone in the middle of sessions. She wanted to talk about what made me feel angry about what had happened. I suddenly felt this wasn't right for me and I could find something better so I told her and left. Then I came home, smashed a piece of old crockery and beat a pillow with a stick. I went from angry to crying then hugging the pillow and I felt better. I thought I would feel awful and blame myself for the end of the therapy but I don't. I do feel sad and discouraged at having to start all over again when I already have plenty of problems, though. I'd love some support.",

        "text": "Trigger warning for description of death.\n\nYesterday i was having a movie night with my wife and friends, watching Inglorious Bastards, and after movie was over i drove my friend home.  On the way there, i mentioned wanting to find a copy of Samson &amp; Sally: The Song of the Whales to watch again, and lamenting the fact that it was only on VHS (1984).\n\nI vividly remember watching it as a young child at some friend's house.  It it quite dark for a kid's movie; there are oil slicks and whalers and radio-active patches.  The scene that most sticks out is when the whales must escape the whaling boats by holding their breath and swimming under an oil slick.  One whale from the pod can't hold his breath and surfaces in the oil, which causes it to get in his lungs and he suffocates, slowly sinking down into the darkness of the ocean gasping for breath, as the others look on in dispair.\n\nMy friend yesterday pointed out to me that i am drawn to stories with dark emotional suffering.  I continue to replay Final Fantasy 7 and consider the best part of the game to be when Aeris is killed and Cloud loses his mind because he believes himeelf to be a puppet.  Last year i rewatched the entire Neon Genesis Evangelion anime for the third time, which is perhaps one of the most angst-ridden anime series ever, as is Full Metal Alchemist when it turns from brotherly love and adventure into sci-fi magic horror.  \n\nWhat Dreams May Come.  Schindler's List.  FF6 World of Ruin.  Xenogears/Xenosaga.  The Golden Compass.  The Dark Tower.\n\nWhere is all this love of the dark side of humanity coming from?  I would have thought i lived through enough depression and angst in my life already.  Why am i drawn to suffering as a moth to a flame?\n\nDoes anybody else feel drawn to emotionally dark material like this?  Have you been able to answer \"why?\"  Have you even asked?  What pulls ACoNs like us to watching stories full of suffering?",

Which feels terrible of course.\n\nMy family is a write-off.  They would withhold help as punishment for my not toeing the line (i.e. not allowing them to abuse me anymore).  But even if I had toed the line, they still wouldn't have helped, but opportunities to abuse must not slip through the net.\n\nI've found out the hard way how unreliable my \"friends\" were, hence the past tense.  I have a whole bunch of crazy stories about people who expected the full benefits of friendship from me but were offering *nothing at all* in return, and then got offended and upset when I moved on.  (Side note: *What even is that?*  If your friend is in crisis and your reaction is to say \"good luck with that\" and change the subject, how can you **not** expect to get dumped?)\n\nI feel like there is this giant myth that if your Family of Origin isn't working out, you'll automatically be able to replace it with a Family of Choice.  But it's entirely out of your control.  You can't make people care about you on that level, you can't make them be better friends or help you.  \n\nI sometimes think that if I ever check out voluntarily, I'll first put up a blog post spelling out who actually cared about me and gets to say anything and who didn't and therefore must STFU.  Because you just know the Narcs will milk it for all the supply they can get.  So at least I can pull that rug out from under them.",

        "text": "Hello! I want to share with you that I got my grades back for an extremely difficult Master's degree that required me to attend classes and live independently in a new country, and I did excellently. I spent a lot of time on this sub and RBN because my family visited me in that other country for xmas and new year's which caused me to have a mental break-down (I have anxiety and depression, which I was managing well until I saw them) during the second term of classes. I saw a doctor and a counselor and met with staff about my mental health and managed well. I got excellent grades and I loved living in a new country and made great friends. I learned a lot. The most difficult part was learning that I am actually capable of doing hard things by myself. As a daughter of N's from a dysfunctional extended family, I constantly doubted myself. Graduate school is anxiety-provoking by itself, without a background of abuse. I dove into RBN and really worked through some extremely hard issues from my past while I was in Master's level classes and doing difficult assignments and learning about a new culture. I did it!\nI wanted to share with you to remind you that it is possible to go for big goals while dealing with trauma from the past. I also met friends who I could trust and confide in and I talked to them about the stuff I was going through. It turned out that a surprisingly large number of Master's student friends were also dealing with mental health issues. One of my friends even signed up for counselling and mindfulness training which helped end a pattern of self-sabotage due to abuse during childhood. I wouldn't have been able to talk with this friend if it weren't for what I had learned from RBN. \nI am also typing this because, due to my anxiety, the excellent grades and my success accomplishing this does not seem real. It feels like the grades are nonsense and I don't deserve them and that I never moved to the other country and did all of that. I'm still meeting with my counselor and I'm looking into other mental health  support to help me with the transition to the next phase of my life and to help me to remember that I am worthy and capable of achieving success. My mantra while working on assignments was \"I am worthy. I am capable.\" (Things that my family never says) I think I will be repeating that mantra for a while. ",

        "text": "This might seem trite, and maybe it is, but I stumbled on this technique that absolutely lifts my mood every time I use it:\nI put a moratorium on complaining.  \n\n\nIt's a simple technique that is actually incredibly easy to implement. Once I start thinking negative thoughts (particularly about myself!) or want to complain about my parents, I just gently remind myself, \"no complaints right now.\"\n\n\nIt's incredibly important that we feel validated in our feelings after growing up with Ns, but there's a point where our search for validation leads to negative self-talk and spirals of anxiety. (At least if you're anything like me...and I'm thinking you must be, if you're in this subreddit too!) Once that happens, continuing to dwell on my upbringing only leads to thoughts of how I'm not good enough, how I'll never accomplish anything, etc. It happens EVERY TIME. I used to get really worked up about it, but then I started temporarily banning complaints, and it is 100% effective for me.\n\n\nIt's not to say that I ban all negativity. (My mom tried that, and I only ended up angrier than ever.) If something isn't good, I say so. \"How did you like that restaurant?\" \"I thought the chicken was a little rubbery. I'm not sure I'd eat there again.\" But I don't harp on it like I used to. And I've become much happier for it.\n\n\nIf I have things I absolutely must complain about, I try to save it for my therapist. I wanted to make sure I had an \"out\" so I wasn't keeping anything bottled in. But the weird thing is, since I stopped complaining, I actually feel like I have less to bottle in, because I'm not holding on to extra anger and resentment. I've actually not had to \"save\" anything to talk to my therapist about, since I started doing this.\n\n\nThe last thing any of us need is to be told what to do, so take this with a grain of salt! I just wanted to post this here in case it helps anyone like it helps me. Your mileage may vary, but I wanted to share this in case it could help anyone else feel better!",

        "text": "I posted earlier about a job interview I had today which went really well. I made the switch from one field to another the last year. I've taken a huge pay cut that's put a lot of strain on me and my husband. It's grunt work that's given me a lot of experience and hopefully will help me get better jobs here soon. \n\nSo I had my first annual review today with my supervisor. I know I'm not perfect at this job. I know  what areas I need to work on and I'm very candid on that. I'm here to learn and grow. I've also been open about my abuse and PTSD bc it can impact my job but I've demonstrated great self awareness for when it does happen. I'm the first to point it out and fix it. \n\nso today I have my review. I get \"meets expectations\" for 70% of the criteria. I only get \"exceeds expectations\" (&amp; there is one category higher) for a few things like my flexibility (well no shit, I've had 4 supervisors this year) and my impeccable  time management and punctuality. My paperwork is superb. It's all administrative stuff. I get 20-25% of the criteria as \"needs improvement\" (&amp; there is one level below that) and it's all about my actual skills on the job. Things that I have struggled with when I first started but have made massive improvements on. The written comments give specific examples of these things but no specific examples of what I do do well that's not administrative. I was called \"judge mental, hostile &amp; uncaring\" by the parents of my clients. (I'm actually the opposite of that!!) The same parents who have as many problems-if not more- as the clients I work with. These comments should be taken with a grain of salt but instead it's put into my review. Nothing positive about my clinical skills. No reviews from the families who did/do love me. It was completely one sided with out any positives or context. \n\nThis triggers me massively. And of course I had a meltdown in the meeting. I just feel like I'm constantly being punished for things that aren't my fault. Don't get me wrong- when something is my fault, I am the first to admit it. My husband says that as a manager, he wouldn't be worried about this review. He does note it's lacking context &amp; I should write a rebuttal. As a husband he wants to punch my nfather for making me have these kinds of reactions. For struggling with these situations. this whole thing makes me feel devastated and like I can't do anything right. My his and recognizes that but says objectively, it's nothing to worry about. Doesn't feel that way. ",
