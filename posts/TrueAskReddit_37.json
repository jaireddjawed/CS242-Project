        "text": "If a friend or family member that you care about is overweight what is the best way to help them? I don't want to sound like I'm body shaming them and I don't want to be in their face about it by sending them links to health related things. The only nice way that I know is by inviting them to join at the gym, but most don't follow through. With that method I would have to dedicate my efforts and time to helping them daily. What about someone that you rarely see but still care about? What could you say or do then? \n\nBonus: What about someone that has an addiction to eating unhealthy foods and they are showing signs of illness, but they don't seek medical help themselves? Should I just let them slowly kill themselves with what they eat? or how would someone approach them with help, without upsetting them?\n\nBonus #2: What if it's a child, how would you approach the parents? Should you just ignore it? The response I often hear is \"It's not your kid, why should you care?\". \n\nHow can you help without ruining relationships/friendships? Or should you let it be and just never bring it up?\n\nEdit: Most of you are suggesting to ignore, but I can't help but feel guilty. I've lost an uncle years ago to heart failure from obesity. He never cared about how the food he ate would effect him as long as it tasted good, and no one ever persuaded him to get into any phisical activities. But I don't intend this to only be a discussion on the approach of someone overweight, but just about anyone who is visibly showing signs of struggle in their health that is seriously putting their life at risk and you feel like you could influence a better life style onto them before it's too late. Be it anorexia, obesity, drug or alcohol abuse, or other, but what could be done to prevent the inevitable outcome; if simply just ignored?",

        "text": "I'm an introverted person and while I don't dislike people (for the most part) I find interacting with them very draining. I usually do my best to avoid people. I'll wait in a longer line at the grocery store so I can use an automated checkout rather than a human one, at work I take my lunch breaks very late in hopes of being the only one in there. I do have a few close friends that I see every once in a while, but I don't feel any real need to make any more friends or visit my friends in person more than I do. \n\nWhen I do interact with people,  I think I do quite well. While a loner, I am also friendly and nice by nature. My psychiatrist has voiced his concern that I'm too isolated and always urges me to be more social and engage in more social activities. I saw a therapist for a few months who echoed this concern. \n\nI'm just not sure why. I think it's good to be independent and okay with being alone. I was surprised by how big an issue it seemed to be for both of them and how much they asked me to be less introverted and to at least try.\n\nCould someone explain this too me?",

I always liked the idea, especially the notion of professional peer-review, minimising the concentration of power within the organisation. \n\nGiven the outrageous and often deliberate misinterpretation of the facts that are published by media outlets today with seemingly no moral regard in mind, the sobering consequences of which we have seen in Brexit and the Trump election, is this an industry in need of better professional self-regulation? As consumers surely this would enable us to choose our news sources with more confidence?",

        "text": "This is a bit long so, bear with me please.\n\nI’m friends with a female teacher (23-27) in Ireland who used to give me extracurricular piano lessons from 2009-2012. She was extremely qualified, fluent in English and quite aesthetically attractive (not sexual in any way); yet, whenever spokes her strong accent was a bit 'off putting’. I was never rude to her or brought ever brought hat up in any discussion, but it was always like a ‘quiet fly in the background’. It slightly detracted from her lovely appearance and personality.\n\nAfter she finished teaching me grades, we started ‘hanging out’, she once shared with me that she was self-conscious about her accent. Having taken some voice-over classes, acting lessons and doing promos and adverts, I suggested perhaps she could gradually soften her accent into a more neutral accent and gave her tips into a soft Irish accent.\n\nDuring my college years, we didn’t have time for contact and to add to that, she also moved to London to find a higher paying job during the recession. We emailed each other (she didn’t use Whatsapp) but mostly didn’t speak. It wasn’t until this month however, when she decided to Skype me for the first time in 4 years.  I was stunned. I thought she was pulling a prank on me when I heard her voice. She was unbelievably attractive. Her current accent was so ‘refined’ compared to her previous accent. Her very strong Irish accent had softened into a hybridized English, and soft Irish accent. It had what they say is a ‘je ne sais quoi’. \n\nNow why do you think this might be the case? I know some people may think she become more feminine with her new accent however I don’t necessarily agree. She was a pretty ‘feminine’ looking woman (long hair, blue eyes, soft skin) and was quite pleasant, so I don’t think you could get more feminine than that. Also her accent wouldn't sound great particularly great on a man either. And she did had a proficient level of English for a native speaker so it’s not like she appeared lower class.\n\n",

So it's pretty hard to picture a United USA by the turn of the century.\n\nCurrently economies like California can compete on their own in the Global Market. While other states are far poorer than the average American based on statistics. So i feel there is too much inequality to call our country the United States.\n\nAlso with the legalization of weed, some states have taken a different path than others. And to be perfectly honest, that must be a pain to handle on a national perspective. Some states enforce some laws, another others. I feel the size of the United States and its principles of liberty and equality are taking a toll on the way to run the country. \n\nCompared to other big countries like China or Russia, they have totalitarian governments. And Canada has too small of a population compared to its size to make a fair comparison.\n\nAlso i feel history is against us. Throughout history nations split, end up divided, join up and split again. What makes us think the United States is different? Even Empires that lasted for thousand of years fell.\n\nSo are we headed towards a Divided United States? Personally i think we might, but its the kids of the current century (people born in 2000 onwards) or their kids that will make that decision. It's part of human civilization. But what do you think?\n\n",
