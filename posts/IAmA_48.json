I am still making blood tests and visiting the endocrinologist and I don't know why am I like this. I was reading the IAmA of [u/20yearsyoung](https://www.reddit.com/user/20yearsyoung) (We have simmilar conditions) and decided to do the same IAmA because i thought you guys will be interested in asking me questions because of the slightly different life that I am living. (Sorry If there are mistakes in my English, it's not my native language)\n\nNormal testosterone range for male is 5.5 - 22,9 , i have 2.02   \n( i want to stay anonymous so I e-mailed the proof to the mods )",

        "text": "I recognize how fortunate I have always been as a member of America's white middle-class. Serving my country in World War II,  I look back on a charmed life. With few unavoidable setbacks, I've had a fulfilling and satisfying life. I've doted on raising a family of four children and nine grandchildren, two \"marriages\" and a profession as an educator. As a school principal I've had a satisfactory income and felt richly rewarded by making a difference in young people's lives. I've lived through a Great Depression, a world war and a variety of police actions and other  world crises. Unfortunately I've seen my country make mistakes - above all its failure to provide freedom and equality for ALL citizens. Yet I have always felt that the trajectory of progress has been in an upward spiral. That a “New World,” a \"promised land\" has been the goal of my beloved country. That is until the past election!  Now living within two miles from the headquarters of the swamp—the White House—I found it difficult to avoid depression in my terminal years.\n\n Yes, I'm now a 92-Year-Old Optimist Who Almost Became Depressed Thinking About the Future of My Country\nI'm appalled by the leadership of my country. It's inconceivable to me that my fellow country men and women have chosen a president who represents and exhibits the worst of what I've known America to aspire to be. I once thought \"American exceptionalism\" was a positive seeking to provide equal opportunity and freedom for all. Now the executive branch of government  projects a aura of leadership by wealth and power bordering on the fascist model. And equally frustrating is a divided second branch of government, the Congress, which is paralyzed by divisiveness putting party over principle. And I fear where the judiciary might soon take us.\n\nThe status quo seemed hopeless until I saw first hand two recent events that gave me hope for the future.  Truly I see a REVOLUTION: a turning away from stale male led divisiveness by involving:\n\t*The long ignored leadership skills of women, and\n\t*The enthusiasm, resilience and idealism of youth as shown by youth of Parkland and     \t  Stoneman Douglas High School. \n\nYet in these turbulent times there are at least three other ingredients from my experience that I feel are vital for securing change.\n1. The wisdom and insights of sages, prophets and solons bringing historic perspective and advice from the past to solve new problems.\n2. Finding new or restored groups and activities to bring citizens together in constructive and meaningful ways. The malaise of separateness that exists in our country today, far exceeds anything I have seen in the past.\n3. Exposing hypocrisy and demanding truth from all segments of our society.\n\n          My lifelong optimism has been fueled by continuing to have communication with young people. Indeed, that was enhanced by four previous AMA's! I hope this fifth attempt will continue this conversation with the youth of  Reddit that has been so meaningful to me. \n\n\nProof: https://i.imgur.com/TmyOLi4.jpg\n\n\n**My short bio:** Enter stuff here\n\n**My Proof:** Enter link here",

What do you obsess about? What is your style? Who do you cheer for at concerts or sports games? \n \nThis is a radically different way of thinking about our taxonomy compared to products or categories—but it is actually reflective of how real people shop.

        "text": "My name is Christian Picciolini. I am a former member of America's first neo-Nazi skinhead gang (Chicago Area Skinheads). I was recruited in 1987 when I was 14 years old and stayed in the movement for eight years, until I was 22 in 1996. I held a leadership position in the Hammerskin Nation, America's most violent skinhead group. I stockpiled weapons hoping to overthrow the US government, and I was asked to meet with Muammar Gaddafi to form an alliance. In 1996, I decided to leave the vicious movement I helped create because I could no longer reconcile my hateful ideology and thoughts with the empathy I began to feel for, and the compassion I began to receive from, those who I deserved it from the least -- those who I previously hated and hurt. After over two decades of self-reflection and atonement, in 2009 I co-founded a nonprofit called Life After Hate, and in 2018 the [Free Radicals Project](http://www.wearefreeradicals.net/), to help educate people on issues of far-right extremism and radicalization and to help people disengage from hate groups and to love themselves and accept others, regardless of skin color, religious belief, or sexual preference.\n\nI published my memoir, [WHITE AMERICAN YOUTH: My Descent into America's Most Violent Hate Movement—and How I Got Out](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316522902) (Hachette, 2018) recently. My story is a cautionary tale that details my indoctrination when I was barely a teen, a lonely outsider who, more than anything, just wanted to belong. When my mentor went to prison for a vicious hate crime, I stepped forward, and at 18, I was overseeing the most brutal extremist skinhead cells across the country. From fierce street brawls to drunken white power rallies, recruitment by foreign terrorist dictators to riotous white power rock music, I immersed myself in racist skinhead culture, hateful propaganda, and violence.\n\nThirty years after I joined this movement, we have seen a metastasis of this movement: from shaved heads and boots to \"fashy\" haircuts, polo shirts, and suits. But is what we're seeing now any different than the hate groups of the past? Has white supremacy become normalized in our society, or was it always \"normal?\" Most importantly, how do we combat this growing youth social movement that is killing more people on American soil than foreign terrorism has?\n\n* More info: [https://www.christianpicciolini.com/](https://www.christianpicciolini.com/)\n* Book: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316522902?tag=hacboogrosit-20](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316522902?tag=hacboogrosit-20)\n* Who is Christian Picciolini? video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY0EwwLvc94](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY0EwwLvc94)\n\nProof: [https://i.redd.it/9rzqkh1bud511.jpg](https://i.redd.it/9rzqkh1bud511.jpg)\n\n**EDIT (6/28/18 - 2:07pm MT) Thanks every one! Great questions. I may pop back in again, so keep them coming!**\n\n**EDIT 2:** [Check out my Aspen Ideas Festival speaker's page where you can see video from my panels](https://www.aspenideas.org/speaker/christian-picciolini)**.**",

Then I started my own practice to help other people who might be suffering like me :)\n\nFor longer stories of how I came to be (and proof I am real), here are some links:\n\n1.

        "text": "In honor of the 58th Anniversary of The Democratic Republic of Congo’s Independence, THIS IS CONGO is in theaters June 29th\n \nWhy is it that some countries seem to be continually mired in cyclical wars, political instability and economic crises?\n \nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is one such a place, a mineral-rich Central African country that, over the last two decades, has seen more than five million conflict-related deaths, multiple regime changes and the wholesale impoverishment of its people. Yet though this ongoing conflict is the world’s bloodiest since WWII, little is known in the West about the players or stakes involved. \n \nTHIS IS CONGO provides an immersive and unfiltered look into Africa’s longest continuing conflict and those who are surviving within it. By following four compelling characters — a whistleblower, a patriotic military commander, a mineral dealer and a displaced tailor — the film offers viewers a truly Congolese perspective on the problems that plague this lushly beautiful nation. Colonel ‘Kasongo’, Mamadou Ndala, Mama Romance and Hakiza Nyantaba exemplify the unique resilience of a people who have lived and died through the generations due to the cycle of brutality generated by thisconflict. Though their paths never physically cross, the ongoing conflict reverberates across all of their lives. \n \nWhen THIS IS CONGO begins in 2012, Rwandan and Ugandan-backed M23 rebels have begun massing in the North Kivu region of Congo, threatening peace and stability. As the film progresses, we watch as the rebellion mounts in intensity and witness its effects on the film’s four major characters firsthand, while flashing back to key moments in Congo’s history. By the film’s conclusion, three years later, THIS ISCONGO has documented this latest cycle of violence from beginning to end and thoroughly unpacked the legacies of colonialism, resource exploitation and genocide that helped make the Congo what it is today.\n \nIn November 2016, after fifteen years in power, President Joseph Kabila cancelled elections extending his rule beyond term limits–  and the cycle of war is likely to start again.\n\nCheck out the trailer here!  https://www.facebook.com/AbramoramaInc/videos/1622639074524295/\n\nProof:  https://twitter.com/This_Is_Congo/status/1011715511212654592",

For more info check: [https://moleman4.com/ama/laszloszenttornyai/](https://moleman4.com/ama/laszloszenttornyai/)\n\nLászló Szenttornyai walked in the door of [Novotrade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appaloosa_Interactive)  in the 80s looking for a job as a game developer. Donát Kiss, the head  of the studio at the time, ended up hiring him and he started working on  games and other applications for the Spectrum as well as the Enterprise  computers that had just been introduced in Hungary. He was the project  manager and designer of the game Ecco the Dolphin which was developed in  Hungary and released by SEGA in 1992. Created by Novotrade’s successor,  Appaloosa Interactive, the game became a worldwide hit. This was partly  attributable to László’s finesse in convincing SEGA to spend millions  of dollars on marketing the game.

        "text": "[Proof](https://imgur.com/a/lPjaTGV) \n\nI had wanted to be a psychiatrist since middle school. Part of my motive was self-interest. I have lived with anxiety all my life and I wanted to get better. I had never felt comfortable admitting I had an unhealthy mind until my first year of medical school, as my anxiety was reaching new heights. Since then, through a combination of professional help, self-help books, psychology texts, training, and strong relationships, I have made pretty good progress in my transformation.  \n\n\nAfter finishing medical school and getting accepted into a psychiatry residency, I had to fill out a bunch of paperwork to get my physician-in-training permit (a temporary medical license for my residency). Somewhere in that paperwork, I disclosed to the Texas Medical Board that I was taking an antidepressant. In my head, I figured I was telling them about my medical history to fight the stigma and normalize depression/anxiety. I was telling them, \"This is me, I'm not perfect, but all doctors are human\". They were, uhh, not receptive.   \n\n\nTo get my permit, the Board required me to surrender my psychiatrist's records, and based on what they read in those records, decided I needed to be in a monitoring program including random drug tests, routine psychiatric evaluations, and regular meetings with Alcoholics Anonymous. I had to pay for all of this out of pocket, and it wasn't cheap. I stuck with it for as long as I could, but about midway through my internship I told my program director I would be resigning at the end of the year.  \n\n\nWhen I look back on my disclosure to the Board, I think my decision was maybe naive but I still think it was the right thing to do. I want to reiterate, the Board's decision was based solely on what I had told my psychiatrist in confidence. I had never been arrested, I had never worked impaired or had an accident or anything like that. I had been instructed by colleagues not to check that box on the paperwork, but I didn't want to start my career with a lie that could later be uncovered.   \n\n\nWhile the monitoring program was a painful experience, it wasn't my only reason for quitting my job. There were parts of the work that I really didn't enjoy, which made me comfortable in my decision to leave. If psychiatry really were my dream job, I think I could have endured the monitoring program. \n\nDuring my internship I found out that I prefer the psychotherapeutic and psychosocial aspects of care, but much of psychiatry is biologically-oriented. I am definitely not anti-psychiatry, though - I don't think I would be where I am today without taking an antidepressant. I'm not currently taking any medications, but I would be open to restarting one if I had to.  \n\n\nI imagine maybe some think my departure from the profession is good riddance, and maybe they are right. Still, I am one less psychiatrist in a field that is already understaffed.  \n\n\nI have a few reasons for making this post:\n\n1. I've been wanting to get this off my chest for a while, and I think doing an AMA might be a cathartic process for me. \n2. I think my story is at the very least interesting, and might even be helpful for some people to hear - I think what I was put through was wrongful, and I hope things change for future doctors. Plus, I still want to work on normalizing mental health struggles, and fight the stigma.\n3. Finally, I hope maybe y'all can give me some advice for moving forward! I've been searching for direction for the past year, and I've learned a lot, but I'm still trying to find my way. I know now that I want to be a psychotherapist, but I'm reluctant to go back to school and add on to my student loans. Also, tbh I'm a little apprehensive about subjecting myself to more licensing boards...\n\nSo please, ask me anything. I can provide the perspective of both clinician and patient. Or maybe you have questions about career changes/premature mid-life crises (I'm 30 years old, btw). Whatever your questions, I'm here for it.  \n\n\n\\-Riley",
