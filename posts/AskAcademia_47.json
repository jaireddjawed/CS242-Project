        "text": "I’m currently a fourth year in a decent US business school doing research on business applications of natural language processing and computer vision. I had an unexpected accident and therefore a concussion last year at school. During the recovery, I thought a lot about my previous life, my passion, and life goal, and eventually took an unexpected turn —- steer away from academia, finish my degree here, and switch to computer science.\n\nI had always been the most hard working and most creative student in my department (esp. the first two years). The zombie who works and exercises fanatically and nothing else. Now that after my accident I decided to enjoy life a bit more, all the while still publishing and getting A+s, but nowhere near the amount of effort I used to put in.\n\nJust now I got an email from my advisors that appears to convey to me the messages that:\n\n(1) my department is not happy with the composition of my committee —- my chair is from another department in business school and my other minor member is from computer science;\n\n(2) my work/pubs got to the point that’s too CS for them, which is disappointing ;\n\n(3) I’m visiting a CS lab and they are not happy with it.\n\nIn the email, they put it: \n\n“The XXX group and the DGS is also seeking clarification from graduate school on committee composition...\nWe will keep you updated on what’s going on as we hear more from DGS/ grad school.  Please reach out to XXX if you need more clarification.  Keep in mind though that we might not be able to provide all the clarifications you need since we are awaiting information from DGS”\n\nWhat can I do about it? My plan was to finish it here asap given that I’ve already put so much work in and it’s not worth going away with anything less than a PhD degree. I felt I was so close.\n\nI feel like having a panic attack now. Would greatly appreciate some advice. Thank you.",

        "text": "Hi All,\n\nso basically I finished my dissertation last year and am now revising it for publication as a book. \n\nIn my dissertation, one of the things I do is that I challenge a particular paradigm in the literature, which I discuss at length in the literature review. Now, after having completed my PhD, I did read some of the monographs discussed in my literature review again. With some distance, I now find that two books that came out during the last year of my PhD (which I therefore had to read and include quickly) may not be sticking to the paradigm as absolutely as I might suggest in the literature review of my thesis. The problem is not that there is much overlap with my work - that is not the case both in terms of the ground covered and sources used - but I am more concerned with a certain degree of nuance that people might say I am lacking in assigning them to the past paradigm. I do not think I am generally wrong in assigning them to that paradigm, but, again, I maybe should have provided a bit more detail in discussing them in contrast to the older literature.\n\nNow my fear is that people might go back to my thesis and criticise me for this lack of nuance and details and say that I am misrepresenting (if only in detail) the previous literature in order to highlight the originality of my work. Also, while I am happy to provide this nuance in my revised book manuscript, I seem to be told by everyone that one should radically cut the literature review for the book, giving me even less space to describe past scholarship in detail.\n\nThus, I am wondering how common this problem is, whether it often happens that past literature gets bundled together (and thus, one might say, is misrepresented) and how people deal with this problem especially given the limited space one has to provide detailed descriptions of each past work in the literature review of one's thesis, let alone a monograph.\n\nThanks for your help!",

First, my family and I want to stay in the Southeast. Second, and more importantly, I have a child with some health problems that restrict our location to metropolitan areas with hospitals in a certain speciality. \n\nGenerally, this limits my academic job search to about 10 cities, and roughly 20-25 institutions. Based on the number (and geographic variety) of applications I see older graduate students go through, I figured it would be better to start early than to end up severely restricted in the long run.\n\nMy question comes down to: **what should I be doing to better network, research, and build connections in the limited institutions I am interested in?** Should I mainly focus on seeking out these researchers at conferences and speaking at my own institution? Any other recommendations to better improve my chances with such a limited search would be greatly appreciated!",

The salary is good and the benefits are great but I'm worried it's the type of job where you burn out after a few years so I'm trying to use my time to figure out what's next before I get there. I always wished I had gone into SLP or something related instead so I'm researching jobs in that area and my main question I guess is, is it possible to be a child language acquisition researcher without having a TT position? I would love a TT position, but nobody will give me one in linguistics since my degree is technically in Spanish. \n\nI have twins who are just starting to talk and I would love to spend the summer recording their speech and hoping they come up with their own little language.

If accepted, the PI can provide funding, and it seems to me they are very interested.  Then there's Lab B, in country B, which is still interesting research-wise but not my top choice, however being in Country B is much better for me personally. Lab B has no funding for me but is willing to write a fellowship application together.  \n\nI'm not the type of person to consider anything a sure thing until I get a firm offer letter, so despite how I feel regarding Lab A, I feel like I should also write this proposal with Lab B just in case.  I would probably get the answer from Lab A whether I am accepted or not around the time the fellowship deadline is for Lab B. Is it terrible form to write a proposal together and draw out of it if I get an acceptance from Lab A?\n\nI'd love to hear from people who may have gone through a similar situation but also from PI's or group leaders who may have to deal with the opposite side of this deal.

The second one I feel like should be my personal tutor, however I never met him for a meeting aside from in first year.

I do have one other lecturer who knows me on a first-name basis, however I feel like she would not tell me to ask my personal tutor instead. \n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1) Are those two choices appropriate?\n\n2) How do I word an email asking for a reference from both of these members of staff?\n\nAlso on a slightly unrelated note, I am applying for grad school at the same university I attended for undergraduate.

I had to miss two of my Final exams (Last Mon and Tues), because the Doctor put me in as a ‘Formal Patient’ under the Mental Health Act and I was ‘detained’ and couldn’t leave the ER for 24 hrs. I have been experiencing serious depression and suicidal thoughts. \n\nI had to apply to my Faculty’s office to get both of my exams Deferred approved. They approved it and scheduled my deferred exams. One of my profs wanted me to write the exam as soon as possible so that they can finish and submit the Final grades right away (which is very understandable). I had to write both of my exam the same day, back to back - no breaks (9:00 Am - 12:00 PM 1st Exam and 12:00 PM - 4:00 PM 2nd Exam). \n\nI was still not feeling very well that day, I was having a mental break down while I was getting ready. I went to the designated Exam room (I was the only one there and the proctor), opened my 1st exam and thought that it was easier than the practice exams. However, I just couldn’t bring myself to think or write anything. I know that I knew the material, but I just stared at my paper for an hour before deciding to just hand it in almost blank. I thought that since I already wasted an hour doing nothing, there’s no way I’ll finish it on time so I might as well use my remainder time to get my shit together for my 2nd exam. \nI told the proctor that I will be back at 12 PM for my 2nd exam, but I never went back. I was just sitting at an empty classroom right across the exam room crying and stayed there for 5 hrs. I wanted to write that exam so bad and pass my exams, but I just couldn’t bring myself to do so. I don’t know how to explain it. I was hoping that I will be able to somehow bring myself back to write the exam. I am so frustrated with myself because I know that this is not a valid excuse and I just need to get over it.\n\n\nMy Accessibility Advisor (advisors for students with learning disabilities - I have a learning disability not related to depression.. Its Vision Related) advised me to apply for a back-dated Medical withdrawl (something I’ve never heard of before). However, when I was talking to the Faculty Advisor she said that she can’t really give me an advice since the only thing that I can do is write a petition letter to the dean. I was told that these are only granted under excruciating circumstances.The Advisors or Profs has no say or any power into this. After writing the letter, it’s all up to the Dean. However, I don’t even know what to write in my petition letter, because I know that I sound so petty and just using ‘Mental Illness’ as an excuse. I don’t think my reason is on the Excruciating-Level of me dying of Cancer or watching a loved-one get brutally murder right in front of me before my exam. \n\n\nBecause of me failing these 2 courses, I am not sure if I can continue on with my studies. I just sabotage my future again and I am not sure what I should do next. \n\nHow do I explain this to the Dean? Should I also include on my letter that I may have an undiagnosed Dyslexia and will get tested in a few weeks? I’ve just been recently referred by the government Health services for Dyslexia assessment. (It costs a lot to get these assessment done where I live and you can only get free assessment done if someone from the University referred you to get tested… then someone from the ‘government’ will interview you to determine if you qualify for a free assessment before you can get the assessment done.

The journal is a fairly good one, a Case Report edition offshoot of one the of journals with the highest impact factor in the field, so I'd imagine they'd have appropriate reviewers already. How common is this though?\n\nI've published a few papers and multiple case reports already and never run into this until the last two submissions. My only real complaint it that I am not the first author on this Case Report and will need to wait for the PI's and first author's approval on recommended reviewers, which in my experience, will take several more weeks at minimum. \n\nAnd how does one go about picking suggested reviewers for something like a one-off Case Report? Shall I just find some active authors from my references on the Case Report and suggest them?",

In April, I contacted one of my previous professors at my school who is Greek and he actually suggested what I should research. He said that he could help me find an affiliate in Greece and write me a LOR for the research abroad application. After some time of really figuring out my topic, I emailed him again (mid-May) and he said he would get back to me. I wrote him an email again at the beginning of June and I haven't received a reply back yet.\n\nSince then, I've been cold emailing multiple professors in my school and in Greece, researchers, and organizations that work with the group of people that I want to conduct research about, but I haven't received any replies from anyone except one professor in Greece who asked me for my CV and my plan for research. It's only been about 5 days since I sent him all of the information but he hasn't replied back to me. I was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions or words of wisdom before I lose all hope about conducting research in Greece. Maybe some tips about how to cold email professors. Anything helps.

I have the exact same experience, and after falling asleep in almost every single one of them I never went again - just did the exercises and exams and got one of the best degrees in my year. So I just assumed lectures indeed were pointless.\n\nNow that I started my PhD I'm planning a lecture on Game Design in video games. I wanted to do a practical seminar with lab exercises, but I didn't expect that hundreds of students would sign up for my class. So now we changed that to the typical lecture + exercise structure. The exercises won't be a problem, but I have no idea how to make lectures engaging.\n\nImagine 500 or so students sitting in a lecture hall. I already know most of them are bored to tears by lectures and just come because they have to or fear they'll miss something for the exam. They'll probably be playing on their phones or doing homework while I'm talking. It feels impossible to start engaging conversations like I could in a small seminar. So how do I minimize this boredom? How do I create a lecture that people actually WANT to attend?\n\nI already changed the structure to\n\n* Lectures and exercises are optional\n* Exercises give bonus points\n* Final grade is a group project, no exam\n\nI firmly believe that noone should ever feel forced to come, but that they should come because they want to learn new things. So now I need to make this as interesting as possible. There's an obvious demand for the subject matter, and I'm very passionate and enthusiastic about it. Thing is that I remember multiple professors being very high-energy and passionate as well and we still fell asleep.\n\nWhat exactly is it that is so boring? How do I prevent it? I want to be the exception and give a course that people remember fondly and tell their friends about, and not the 'ugh, I hope I don't fall asleep' guy.",

As long as I was listening to the communities I was talking about rather than formulating my own arguments without those crucial perspectives I could tell myself that I wasn't being disrespectful and hogging up air and was elevating the voices of marginalized people in the process. Plus, like, my papers were just shitty assignments that nobody beside my prof would ever see. \n\n\nRecently I read a hot-take on Instagram wherein the OP said men shouldn't work in gender studies and white people shouldn't work in critical race fields, because they're occupying positions that could be given to people about whom these fields are focusing on. \n\n\n\nNow that I'll be potentially getting paid to write on issues like race, sexuality, etc. in media, I'm wondering if I should just stay in my lane and focus on writing about subjects pertaining to whiteness and womanhood or if my previous approach is (ethical? right? fair?) *enough*.\n\n\n\nDo any of you Humanities scholars ever experience this kind of anxiety?

And eveyone in the research group is going to move there within 6 months. So now I'm going to move again from my new home to a decidedly less interesting city, although in terms of universities this is a small/moderate step up. Overall, just really not something I needed having just moved from another country to work here. \n\nSo to anyone else looking for a postdoc or a PhD position, it might be prudent to ask any potential PIs if they are planning to apply for positions elsewhere in the medium term. \n\nEdit: To add a question to this post, what now? I don't see many options other than moving with the PI.",

While I like biology theory I hated the lab, so I decided to do another degree in computer science in which I found my calling. Particularly around business analysis and database systems and other data science subjects.\n\nOnce I finished my degree I was coerced into doing a PhD in bioinformatics by my honors supervisor. I never was going to apply as I wanted a job, but last minuted decided to just submit an application for a PhD. Turns out I got accepted into the PhD program (along with 2 other Job offers) and decided to go down the PhD route simply cause of maybe one day returning to the university and becoming a Lecturer (I love teaching, another passion of mine).\n\nThe PhD was a very difficult experience for me as I never had true passion for it, but once it was over I was relived. Because I actually did a decent job with my thesis and got 4 publications out, my supervisor offered me a bioinformatics postdoc position which I agreed to give a try, purely because I thought I would get some good teaching experience.\n\nI am now 1.5 years into the postdoc and hating it. It really isn't what I want to do in my life, i have no (and never had) any intention of tenure track and running my own lab. I have little passion for the work I do, all I have are a good set of skills, that I can apply, but I cant translate that to writing papers cause it is another thing I hate. Publishing. The past 1.5 years has been further made difficult due to many personal issues and all of this has made me incredibly depressed. A depression that I have never felt before in my life (That I have also neglected to take care off).\n\nI want out, and I want to get out to either teaching, or going into a full IT job. However, i am feeling that my skills are not \"up-to-date\" enough for me to be worth hiring. Moving to industry is difficult purely because the 4 year PhD and the 1.5 years in a post doc mean my IT skills are lacking.\n\nWhat advice can people give me? Has anyone made a shift from a a bioinformatics PhD/postdoc into industry (such as a data science job?).\n\nTL\\_DR: Was never passionate about a career in academia, but got into a postdoc. Hating it. I want out. Want to move to industry or a full teaching job. Any advice would be much appreciated!",

I argued that in the current era of post-truth politics, in which we are faced with fake news, disbelief of the media and democratization of the truth, academia should have the role of guardians of the truth. Academia should claim authority based on expertise, and policy making should be based on scientific facts rather than subjective and emotional arguments.\n\nHowever, a valid counterargument given was that science produces subjective truths itself. Factors such as choosing certain scientific instruments and methodologies over others, environmental conditions and scientists' values, can determine the outcomes of research, creating different 'truths'.\n\nMy questions are thus; should academia be considered as the guardian of truth in current society? and should academic facts be considered objective enough to form the basis of policy making?\n\nThe subject really intrigues me, so I am mostly just looking for new insights.

I wanted to obtain the transcript - she raises some really wonderful points and cites literature I'd like to explore. However, while the lecture host usually provides transcripts, this particular lecture is *not* available.\n\nWhat's the rule about these types of things - would it be strange or rude for me to contact this faculty member to ask for the transcript? Should I just assume she didn't want it available for a reason?\n\nIf it helps, this particular faculty is in the humanities, though her work is used widely in the social sciences. (I'd like to avoid naming specific names. However, this is in the United States.)\n\nThanks!\n\n(edited for grammar)",

Why the effort to identify a work if it doesn't seem to expand much beyond the other literature in the bibliography?\n\nI asked a professor about their own research process, and here's their response (paraphrased):\n\n*I had to do a bit of background research (several months' worth) before I could even write my dissertation proposal. Once I had my proposal approved, I would do some background reading for each chapter section. Then, I'd start writing. I*\n\n*During the revision process, I'd say I would pull in some new material as I needed it and would take time to research, but it was not to the same level as the rough draft. Once I figured out how this dissertation genre worked, I was able to revise the rest of the chapters in 8 months.*\n\n*Some bibliographic detail simply strengthens the credibility of the author and demonstrates his/her knowledge of the field.* \n\nI'm not in school right now but I like reading papers - and I would like to learn how to do research better so I too can develop such an extensive working knowledge of publications. So I guess the second question: how do academics do research and acquire a working knowledge of publications so they can cite them in this manner?\n\nI've done some reading on this and asked some librarians, and some people say they save every publication they've read along with a small summary, which I've started doing too. Is that really common?\n\nThanks for your time! ",

My issue is that I currently work in the education sector--and I've seen first-hand how a lot of colleges and unis (especially here in the UK) love to cut corners and use the same out-of-date software (my current workplace uses software that hasn't been updated for ten years) for as long as possible. I've also attended a big convention on IT support training two years back, and met a few representatives from  NIDirect and QAA that told all of us that quite a few unis/colleges have been ignoring current demand (for IT skills and coding) when training/teaching their students. So I definitely don't want to fall in the same situation where I put in a lot of effort for a course that wouldn't be help me put my skills to a good use. \n\nPlus, I have to find a course that either runs during the evenings or in weekends (as I can't quit work to study). I currently have Rapidweaver and Dreamweaver, and what I do is mostly self-taught (I don't think I can be relied on in a job setting, hence why I want to learn the ropes properly and make sure I can do big projects). But so far, I can't seem to find any trustworthy courses that teaches during weekends or in evenings (plus I'm not really sure how to begin 'the right way'.  I know that doing web designing involves a lot of overlap with knowing how to do graphic design and coding, so if you guys have any tips--I'd absolutely appreciate it!).",

For example, one of their big concerns is that our findings are not novel and this has been done before, and they provide two citations of papers that supposedly have addressed the same research questions. Not only do they not address the same questions, they are in completely different contexts, and the one is an article written in the opinion section of a non-peer reviewed magazine where they collect no data, answer no research questions, cite no other work, they just talk broadly on the topic from their own perspective. \n\nI know you generally tell reviewers they made really good points and then try to address them, but what do you do when the points are way off-base and dumb?

        "text": "It is so common for students, post-docs and faculty to live and breathe the work, and to attach our identities and self-worth to what we do. When inevitable failure happens (and it does happen to everyone), it is a really tough challenge to fight back against the internal dialogue of \"I'm worthless and a waste of a degree, everything I've done amounts to nothing and what's the point of all of this?\". I'm feeling this so hard right now, with my main project and supposedly easy side projects all producing failure after failure after failure, down to the simple first-step experiments that shouldn't even be the difficult part. Every day is a struggle and I have nothing to show for it. I am on a prestigious fellowship and my mentors are rooting for me and keep encouraging me (which is great), but I am so ashamed.\n\nI am nine months into my second post-doc, so I am no stranger to the ups and downs of science and how it works; failure and I are VERY close friends. Over the last decade of science, I have become very good at the daily decompression ritual - enjoying hobbies and drinks with my SO and friends, etc. But the much larger problem of reconciling my personal identity and sense of self-worth and the non-stop failure I am facing in my work life still is a major struggle for me. I honestly feel like a worthless pile of trash when nothing in my professional life is going well. I don't feel like I deserve to be here. Major impostor syndrome.\n\nSo my big picture question is this: What strategies do you use to mentally and emotionally handle relentless failure in the lab? How do you stop failure in your work from steam-rolling your self-esteem?\n\n**EDIT:** Thank you all for your responses and suggestions. I'm getting a lot of comments regarding accepting and welcoming failure as part of the scientific process and contribution to knowledge. As I mentioned in my post, this isn't my first rodeo; I'm a senior scientist in a hands-on lab in STEM, I spent my PhD facing failure every day, and my first post-doc and now the second doing the same thing. I've mentored many students through their failures too. I have also struggled in the rest of my life in other ways I won't discuss here. So, I understand with every ounce of me that failure is a gift. In the lab, like in life, we learn by failing and then integrating the mistakes. In the lab failures can mean scratching an option off a list of things to try, and that in itself is a lesson that is valuable to others. **I get it**. In a cranial, rational, pragmatic way, I get it. But that's *not* what I'm talking about. I'm a human being, and I have flaws. I feel shame. I am asking how to see past the things we can mentally understand and try to build confidence when our abilities at work are tied to our self-esteem, even though our rational minds can understand the value of the failure.",
