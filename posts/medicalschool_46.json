I was very involved with music (literally got a Bachelors in it), but during med school, I barely touched my instrument. I just never had time or energy. I was in great shape, now I can barely run a few miles (though at least I can still put running down as a hobby I guess). I used to read for fun, now I can‚Äôt even remember the last thing I read.\n\nMy actual hobbies in med school have been sleeping, drinking coffee, something social once a month at max, and keeping myself and my dog alive. \n\nI think I am actually ok with the fact most of my hobbies died, but now I have to be judged on the fact that my new ‚Äúhobbies‚Äù are boring/normal or that I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúmake‚Äù time for them? You literally can‚Äôt win in med school.",

As a result, a lot of the prior hobbies I used to do have been thrown by the wayside, and I haven‚Äôt really had the chance to spend any meaningful time doing community service or other activities.

How do you cope with this?\n\nI have finished my med school and internship and currently I'm waiting to get my licence to practise medicine. The reason why I liked medicine as a job is the stability of the field, decent pay and being able to work with your mind. \n\nLike all the people here, I also figured out radiology is the best specialisation. Where I live it's not competitive, it pays well in private practise and work life balance is decent. Plus, you work in a comfy office without patient interaction. The perfect residency, for me at least. \n\nRecently, after discovering chatGPT and well [this](https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/news-from-the-bhf/news-archive/2022/march/superhuman-20-second-ai-heart-tool-begins-nhs-roll-out) article I am reconsidering it and I do not have much time to make a decision. I'm fully aware it won't replace rads yet, but in the near future it surely will or at least decimate the workforce. It will probably replace all white collar jobs that have no complicated physical component/procedures. Going into DR and then opting into IR seems like a best of both worlds, but other residencies love to steal procedures so it might not be a good option. \n\nOther options are going for Neuro which I kinda like but unfortunately they don't have many procedures or trying to force myself into GI or Cardio because they do have them. Unfortunately, internal medicine here is almost as competitive as ophto/derm. Also thinking about Anesthesia since it has some manual work and you have legal responsibility on your hands + it is the least competitive specialisation here because it pays poorly and has awful work/life balance. Mid level creep doesn't bother me because this doesn't happen here. NPs are barely competent to do their own job, let alone be a doctor. \n\nAre surgery and procedure heavy specialisations the only hope left? I'm extremely risk averse and neurotic and this whole AI thing is making me extremely ill and depressed. You spend your life honing your skills to be irreplacable or at least have a good job security only to realise you will be first on the chopping block. The question isn't if, it's when. We will become more efficient, but that just means less doctors not less work hours. Last night my anxiety got so bad, I started to vomit. The reddit tech bros cheering for it don't realise their own job is at risk as well. Their peers are making their own replacements.",

        "text": "Hello all, so I have an interesting situation. I‚Äôm a 24 year old male and will be graduating with a bachelors in IT Management from WGU this spring. I thought I was into IT for a while but realizing now that that‚Äôs not what I want but I‚Äôm basically finished with the degree so I thought it‚Äôd be dumb to switch it up at this point when the finish line is right there. However I‚Äôve always been interested in medicine and med school potentially. I‚Äôve been researching for a while and understand everything that needs to be done to be accepted. So I do know that I would need to do a postbacc and do very well and I‚Äôm prepared for that. However my question involves my past. When I was younger I was more dumb and naive and didn‚Äôt know what I wanted to do and ended dropping out of two different community colleges. Back then I just wasn‚Äôt focused on school and a career like I am now and I now have things focused and figured out. So my question is will I be screwed for any potential of getting into a med school because of those dropouts from college? I understand if so but I just want to know realistically what the chances are of being accepted. I also understand that it depends on other things like GPA and volunteering and shadowing hours and clinical experience etc. but I‚Äôm more just asking if that sole fact will screw me over potentially. Anyway thanks for reading this far and I appreciate all responses!",

        "text": "Just got my last clerkship grade and got straight honors this year. Personally, I'm a high anxiety, naturally introverted person, but honestly I found a pretty formulaic way that helped me nail every rotation. Here's the spark notes in case anyone was looking for pointers to try out:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Personality mirroring**\n   * I literally **cannot stress this one enough**. Make your personality moldable to whatever the vibe of that team is. Is your senior super maternal and loves to coddle you and check in? Guess what, all of a sudden you have tons of questions and want to debrief that 'challenging patient interaction' from rounds. Is your senior terse and kind of hates you being there? Great, now you're the most silent, self sufficient med student who asks maybe one, very good question all day and leaves when they're told. Goes for pretty much anyone on the team. Figure out the type of person they want to be with (usually someone like them) and try your best to match it. I really cannot impress upon you that this is the best way to click with anyone on the wards. \n* Don't be annoying\n   * Sounds simple but Jesus Christ. Realize that being a med student is your only job, but you're very ancillary to the residents' jobs. Don't interrupt them while they're busy unless its urgent, wait for opportune times. **On surgery, the best time to approaching your resident with a logistics/otherwise question is during closing.** They have to be there with you and that's when they'll be most open to talking. \n* Nail your presentations and know your patients\n   * The **highest yield** way to impress your team. Literally the entire focus is on you. Here are my tips: 1) **WRITE OUT** exactly what you are going to say. I literally used to type out my presentations every morning with at minimum, bullet points for every point I wanted to make. This way you're not using filler words and you can sound confident. 2) at least once every 1-2 days, **look up just one thing in the literature you can throw in**. \"I was reading last night and saw X can be associated with X\". Don't overdo this, but once every couple days will absolutely impress your attending. \n   * Know your patients. My rule of thumb was there should never be a medication order in that you don't know what for. \n* **Ask upperclassmen** for where the best rotations are\n   * Honoring everything is like 15-20% luck. Ask your M3/4s where the easy graders are and where to avoid. There are absolutely sites that don't give out any honors, and sites where honors is automatic. This is a serious key. \n* Don't neglect the shelf studying\n   * Obviously, but it happens. Get through the **UWorld, and do your Anki 2 or more times** before the shelf. Use your lunch breaks, down time, etc. to get it done. It is such an arbitrary way to forfeit your grade. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realize that was long, but hopefully, if you were interested, it was a little helpful! Best of luck to everyone!!",

I realized during neuro and surgery and now IM that something about the angio suite really gets me excited. BUT....for someone who needs procedures and to physically do things. **Is it even worth considering interventional cards at the risk of having to do something else in IM that's not procedural compared to Anesthesia where I could always do cardiac or critical care as a fellowship to be around really critical patients?**",
