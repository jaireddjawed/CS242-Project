Do they mean we would need to harvest all the available chemical energy of several Jupiters to have the energy needed? Do fission plants really put out THAT much energy, that it would only need to be reduced ten times? It really has my brain confused.",

I think it‚Äôs fair that they explode to spread spores in which if the explosion kills a human, it‚Äôs an excellent nutrition source for growth and if it doesn‚Äôt, they attach to people anyway and get propagated wherever the person goes.\n\nMy question is, would it theoretically be possible for a plant to evolve this way with bones and blood?

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n|  I think T rexes looked this way. The short arms where actually part of wings made of materials that could not survive the meteorite. They used their wings in a flapping manner to make their enemies afraid and for mating rituals. They had beautiful and scary at the same time patterns on their wings like butterflies. Their eyes where allot bigger and they had deep black eyes that striked fear into their opponents. They where allot meatier and bulkier than described by scientist because scientist only put skin on the bones not muscle and fat its not a realistic interpretation of how the dinosaur looked. Their snouts where very well developed because they had special thin layers of skin infront of their eyes that they used to take in more circulating air for their smelling capabilities and behind their ears they had gills so that they could swim with their tails behind them because they evolved from water animals and it was allot hotter and wetter when dinosaurs where around so maybe the nose and ear holes where used for air circulation to keep the head cool. They probably also had spikes or round shapes on their backs as protection for if they would fall and extra counter body weight for their limbs infront so they had better posture. I dont believe they had feathers maybe feathery wings but not fully made out of feathers because they probably could not fly or maybe glide a little bit in a hopping manner. I do believe they had elephant like feet only than in a dragon like fashion with spikey toes that protruded from the back and fisher claw like nails that gave them the ability to stay in place inside or trees or other materials because of their big size they could not have thin bird like feet their bones dont look strong enough to hold allot of weight if they had bird feet. And last but not least they had horse like protruding lips and teeth that brought fear and expression into the ones they ate because they are assumed to be meat eaters and they had a bolb like tail with hair and a spike for mating rituals that looked like a male productive system but didnt function this way. Maybe they climbed into trees and fought inside the trees like we did when we where monkeys trees where also extremely tall in the dinosaur era like the seqouia trees of our era so maybe they climbed into it with spikey feet and builded a nest made out of the tree branches instead of twigs and next to this hunted in a jumpy manner after animals on the ground or in the trees. They where like the exotic bird of paradise inside of the brazil forest in combination with a tigers and horse predator sprinting vibe. I think they where allot more interesting then they are perceived to be because they had allot more time to evolve than we humans have from chimp to human. So they could specialize because of the big biodiversity and this way it was a very tropical world because there was 3 times more oxygen and a more chaotic climate in those times.|here is a link for the drawing I made : [https://imgur.com/fGflJ0w](https://imgur.com/fGflJ0w)||\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||||",

But what keeps the object constantly moving toward the ground (giving it weight) once it's lost its momentum through space? Is it momentum through time? Or I remember reading something saying that the earth is actually accelerating outward and therefore creating an equal and opposite force and so the equivalence principle creates the illusion of gravity. If that's the case I don't understand how it can be accelerating outward without changing its size in space. Is spacetime being sucked into the planet like a 3D whirlpool, thus allowing acceleration without any apparent change in size? \n\nAlso, check out Thad Roberts' Ted x talk about the hypothesis of quantized spacetime, which seems to suggest gravity is the result of higher densities of spacetime quanta around massive objects, which also seems to explain some other quantum and relativistic phenomena.

They are a very interesting concept, because we have been taught about the chimney effect in architecture school and that in buildings the height of a medium skyscraper a continuous vertical shaft could blow up the building's glass facade. So we are talking about enormous amounts of energy.\n\nIf the stack effect can work on a building, it could also work on an unglazed tower of immense height, possibly over 1 km. Of course a source of heat is still required, so part of the tower's height near the base could be glazed so that the heat necessary to create airflow would be within the tower itself. If true, this would solve a major issue of conventional solar power, which is the area required.",

        "text": "Take ADHD. The stimulants (methylphenidate and amphetamine) are the \"first-line\" molecules; call the best reaction that you ever get from those molecules the \"gold-standard reaction\". \n\nPatients will (unless there's a reason not to) try the stimulants first, but failing the stimulant patients will try something like atomoxetine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomoxetine). How many patients who fail the stimulants ever do well on atomoxetine or even get a gold-standard reaction on atomoxetine? \n\nAnd failing stuff like atomoxetine, patients will start to use other molecules; how many patients who fail the stimulants and fail atomoxetine (and fail everything else on atomoxetine's level) do well with this third-tier of molecules or even get a gold-standard reaction on this third-tier of molecules? \n\nIt's like a sieve; that seems like a good metaphor. We don't want to know how well a given molecule is for the general ADHD population necessarily, but instead we want to know if it can work well for people who \"fell through the sieve\" down to the bottom level. If you can help the people at the bottom of the sieve then you've helped everyone; the others found success further up the sieve. \n\nI assume that studies look for people with \"treatment-resistant\" ADHD and then see how new molecules do with these people. \n\nSee the following mentions of some interesting-sounding molecules that could be tested on \"treatment-resistant\" ADHD: \n\nhttps://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcpp.13696\n\n&gt;Studies of the action of novel neuro-moderators are providing new insights into the possible basis of heterogeneity in the broader ADHD phenotype. This may help with the identification of novel treatment targets for ADHD sub-groups. Recent attention has focused on orexins ‚Äì arousal-promoting peptides, which arise in the hypothalamus and brainstem and project to the locus coeruleus, where they increase firing of noradrenergic neurons with knock-on effects on dopaminergic activity (Sakurai, Saito, &amp; Yanagisawa,‚Äâ2021). Orexins play a key role in modulating a range of ADHD-implicated processes; reward, attention, arousal, appetitive behavior, and sleep (Katzman &amp; Katzman,‚Äâ2022; Subramanian &amp; Ravichandran,‚Äâ2022; Villano et‚Äâal.,‚Äâ2017). Medication-na√Øve children with ADHD have been found to have decreased serum orexin A levels (Baykal et‚Äâal.,‚Äâ2019). Also, suvorexant ‚Äì a dual orexin/hypocretin receptor antagonist ‚Äì produced a decrease in cocaine-induced premature responding in an animal model of impulsivity (Gentile et‚Äâal.,‚Äâ2018). Modafinil, a DAT blocker and partial orexin agonist, has shown positive effects in ADHD clinical trials, although there have been concerns about adverse side effects (Wang et‚Äâal.,‚Äâ2017). Recent research has also focused on the serotonergic effects of viloxazine ER, a newly approved (in the US) nonstimulant (Yu, Garcia-Olivares, Candler, Schwabe, &amp; Maletic,‚Äâ2020). While the currently accepted mechanism of action is attributed solely to NET blockade ‚Äì viloxazine is a moderate inhibitor of NET and elicited moderate activity at noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems ‚Äì it also acts on the serotonin system. In vitro binding studies with viloxazine demonstrated antagonist activity at 5-HT2B and agonistic activity at 5-HT2C receptors. In vivo administration of viloxazine to rats yielded increased extracellular serotonin levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). It remains to be seen whether these insights can lead to new treatment approaches, which target selected difficulties in people with ADHD. For example, might subgroups of individuals (perhaps those with impulsive aggression) respond preferentially to ADHD medications, which include prominent serotonergic effects? Might novel drugs targeting the orexin system be useful in treating individuals with ADHD and low motivation and/or under-aroused clinical presentations (e.g., sluggish cognitive tempo)?\n\nhttps://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcpp.13696\n\n&gt;Increased awareness of clinical and neurobiological heterogeneity in ADHD has given rise to calls for a more a personalized approach to intervention. In this context, a nuanced understanding of neurochemistry and its clinical application could be highly relevant. Unfortunately, several novel drugs recently examined for use in ADHD either failed in Phase 3 or need additional study to establish their therapeutic benefit ‚Äì including: vortioxetine (SNRI; 5-HT1A/1B partial agonist); metadoxine (ion pair salt of pyridoxine; 5-HT2B agonist/GABA modulator), dasotraline (DA‚Äâ+‚ÄâNE reuptake inhibitor), fasoracetam (metabotropic glutamate agonist); molindone (D2 and 5-HT2B antagonist) (Nageye &amp; Cortese,‚Äâ2019; Pozzi et‚Äâal.,‚Äâ2020). Previous research using nicotinic agonists (Potter, Schaubhut, &amp; Shipman,‚Äâ2014), H3 antagonists (Weisler, Pandina, Daly, Cooper, &amp; Gassmann-Mayer,‚Äâ2012), and ampakines (Danysz,‚Äâ2002) ‚Äì all known modulators of catecholamine neurotransmission ‚Äì also failed to show efficacy. While there is no doubt a multiplicity of possible reasons for these failed trials, a key question yet to be adequately considered is whether medications, which indirectly impact catecholamine function, might be more suitable for a subpopulation of individuals with ADHD ‚Äì in which case studying them in the larger ADHD population might yield an overall inadequate response. It is hoped that future research will use a more targeted approach with refined ADHD phenotypes.",

I want to know if their claims have any real merit; of course, it will initially be *more difficult* to manufacture these products without fossil fuels (for which it is worth the difficulty), but is there anything that is ***actually beyond our knowledge*** to produce without fossil fuels, even impractically‚Ä†?\n\n[I have said before](https://reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/paq7t9/thanks_for_decomposing_guys/ha7o8if/?context=999), in what is likely somewhat of an exaggeration, that fossil fuels haven't been needed for modern industrial civilization ***since 1925,*** when the Fischer‚ÄìTropsch process was developed, which enabled the synthesis of long-chain hydrocarbons from carbon monoxide and hydrogen. This carbon monoxide and hydrogen could come from producer gas (e.g. from biomass) or from the electrolysis of captured atmospheric carbon dioxide and available water (all pre-existing technologies, potentially using renewable energy, which also existed), in both cases allowing the production of bulk hydrocarbon products like gasoline, kerosene, and paraffin in an entirely carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative fashion.\n\nHowever, while it may have been theoretically possible to manufacture green petrol in the later Model T age, even then there were a large number of products synthesized from fossil fuels that were considerably more complex than the simple hydrocarbons (largely, and ideally for the purpose of fuel production, alkanes) the Fischer‚ÄìTropsch process produces. Now, our capacity for total synthesis as well as our ability to utilize biosynthesis has massively increased in the past 97 years, but also has the variety of petroleum-derived compounds.\n\nAnd so, the question. **If the answer is \"yes\", what are the limiting products? If it's \"no\", when did we gain total theoretical independence from fossil fuels?**\n\n‚Ä†Say, by a very convoluted dozen-step process that ends up with a 5% yield or something.",

        "text": "Let's say a casual science enthusiast has spent a couple years keeping up with a certain branch of science, and has developed a relatively broad, respectably deep, but crude and imprecise understanding of the branch. We can describe this person as having a great conceptual understanding, but poor technical mastery of the relevant information.\n\nThe enthusiast formulates a thought experiment and accompanying hypothesis. The enthusiast cannot themselves scrutinize the hypothesis with specific data or math (beyond their application of the general concepts, due to their limited resources and informal training), but it turns out that when examined by someone who is able to apply rigorous scrutiny to the thought experiment, it holds up and ends up being the catalyst for a paradigm shift within this branch of science. Let's assume that the hypothesis *is* correct, that it *does* successfully shift the paradigm of thought leaders in the field after appropriate scrutiny, and that if the enthusiast hadn't thought of it then it would have emerged from the formal channels of properly trained scientists sometime at a later date anyway. In other words, the enthusiast happened to intuit the correct answer without a full understanding of the precise mechanisms at play.\n\nMy question is, how would the enthusiast be viewed in this situation by the scientific community, and how would they be remembered by records of scientific history? Let's say the enthusiast constructs the thought experiment, then they bring it to an expert or a few experts who are able to publicize their findings and bring the idea to the broader scientific community after proper scrutiny. Does the enthusiast get any credit or recognition at all for coming up with the correct or near correct hypothesis by itself (backed of course by a respectable and relevant but imprecise amount of reasoning and logic), or are the experts the ones who get all the credit, because they were the one with the ability to more rigorously scrutinize the idea?\n\nLess hypothetically, are there any recorded examples of a layman contributing a nonrigorous component of a huge breakthrough at some point in scientific history?",

So they are probably really weak.\n\nBut I would still want to know how much big would a single solenoid valve-like need to be in order to lift 4kg.\n\nI ask specifically 4kg because [for every 1 square centimetre of cross sectional area, muscle fibres can exert a maximum force of approximately 30‚Äì40 newtons (the weight of a 3‚Äì4 kg mass)](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+newtons+a+human+muscle+apply%3F&amp;ei=agR0Y9LIH4zD5OUP5KqC0Ag&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjSpYnDkLH7AhWMIbkGHWSVAIoQ4dUDCA8&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=how+many+newtons+a+human+muscle+apply%3F&amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIFCAAQogQyBQgAEKIEMgUIABCiBDIFCAAQogQ6CggAEEcQ1gQQsANKBAhNGAFKBAhBGABKBAhGGABQ9QRYog5glRBoAnABeACAAcABiAH3CJIBAzAuN5gBAKABAcgBCMABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp). \n\nSo I can kinda grasp how big would actual electromagnetic artificial muscles would need to be.\n\nElectric motors are certainly cheaper and simpler, but artificial muscles are still cool as heck.",
