        "text": "This summer has seen extreme weather, in particular extended heat waves and wildfires, across the globe- including Europe, South Asia, Japan, and the United States. Leading experts believe such concetrations of extreme weather are 'the face of climate change' as [Prof. Michael Mann of Penn State University says](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/27/extreme-global-weather-climate-change-michael-mann).\n\nThis week saw deadly wildfires near Athens, with close to a hundred dead and widespread damage. The government has [received criticism for its response](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/28/greece-wildfires-firefighters-attack-government-response), including from Greece's Federation of Firefighters. Within that story is an argument that the loss of life was influenced by Greek's austerity programs:\n\n&gt;Echoing Varoufakis’s argument that austerity inflicted on Greece had also played a role in the inability of authorities to respond effectively to the disaster, Stathopoulos admitted that budget cuts had rendered at least 30% of the service’s fire engines useless. The debt-stricken country has applied the tough measures in return for bailout loans to keep bankruptcy at bay.\n\n&gt;“About 15% of our fleet of 1,750 trucks are off the roads because they have chronic problems and are old,” he said. “Another 15% are in need of spare parts which we can’t afford. As firefighters we take an oath to protect people and their properties. We know when to recommend that areas be evacuated, but for some reason our recommendation was not heard. This is a huge tragedy for our country and apologies are owed.”\n\n**Austerity, the process of reducing the deficit (and perhaps the debt) of a state through tax increases and budget cuts,** has been a common theme of post-Great Recession Europe. Greece has had an unusually long, severe austerity regime running, approaching a decade and length ([see the latter part of the BBC's timeline of Greek history](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17373216)). The European Union, in its negotiations with Greece, have demanded cuts to the fire service that led to its budget being [reduced almost a quarter from 2009 levels](https://phys.org/news/2018-07-greek-tragedy-suprise.html).\n\nAusterity has been promoted by many establishment officials and economists. A famous academic study by Reinhart and Rogoff of Harvard found that high national debt inhibited growth. While some of their underlying math has since been challenged, [there is a substantial community that believes their findings are still true](https://www.ft.com/content/2df58ce0-a8ba-11e2-bcfb-00144feabdc0) and support austerity programs.\n\nThe evidence of austerity being an effective strategy for debt is contentious. Two economists for the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an organization known for advocating austerity through 'structural adjustment', [released an article saying that neoliberalism](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2016/06/ostry.htm), the ideology under which austerity is advocated as a solution, is 'oversold'. In part:\n\n&gt;However, there are aspects of the neoliberal agenda that have not delivered as expected. Our assessment of the agenda is confined to the effects of two policies: removing restrictions on the movement of capital across a country’s borders (so-called capital account liberalization); and fiscal consolidation, sometimes called “austerity,” which is shorthand for policies to reduce fiscal deficits and debt levels. An assessment of these specific policies (rather than the broad neoliberal agenda) reaches three disquieting conclusions:\n\n&gt;•The benefits in terms of increased growth seem fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries.­\n\n&gt;•The costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent. Such costs epitomize the trade-off between the growth and equity effects of some aspects of the neoliberal agenda.­\n\n&gt;•Increased inequality in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth. Even if growth is the sole or main purpose of the neoliberal agenda, advocates of that agenda still need to pay attention to the distributional effects.­\n\nThere are numerous proposed alternatives to austerity as currently practiced (though [some commentators have insisted that there is in fact, no alternative](https://www.ft.com/content/7864786c-92aa-11e1-b6e2-00144feab49a)). The Guardian [compiled ten proposals from across the spectrum](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/alternatives-austerity-ideas-across-spectrum) in regards to the United Kingdom's austerity program, which began around the 2010 election.\n\n**What are the pros and cons of austerity, at this point in time, with some countries having spent many years implementing austerity programs?** \n\n",

        "text": "Amidst high levels of violence, directed at both politicians and civilians, Pakistan [held an election](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/pakistan-elections-2018-latest-updates-180724055555410.html) that seems to indicate Imran Khan's PTI has won, albeit not a majority. This opens the possibility of a civilian-to-civilian transfer of power, which has been infrequent in Pakistani history.\n\nThere exist opinions that this victory was influenced by the decisions of Pakistan's powerful military. Shamila Chaudhary, who was an official under the Obama administration and now is an adviser at Johns Hopkins, [describes](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/27/632673383/opinion-imran-khan-has-declared-victory-in-pakistans-election-but-the-military-w?t=1532734461945): \n\n&gt;But the legitimacy of Khan's government will undoubtedly be questioned for the duration of his tenure. Ironically, in shaping the political environment to favor Khan, the establishment has effectively handicapped its own candidate.\n\n&gt;With Sharif's party sidelined and Khan having to defend his legitimacy, the establishment has taken a page out of a playbook from the 1990s, when the military would pit politicians against each other to ensure weak coalition governments wouldn't unify against military influence. This era ended in 1999, when Musharraf ousted Sharif in a military coup.\n\n&gt;The return to 1990s-style party politics has ushered in a backsliding of Pakistan's democratic culture, which begs the question: Could it also eventually lead to another coup? The makings of it are already underway, with Pakistan's politicized judiciary, compromised media, an exhausted and untrusting electorate, and a fractured political elite.\n\nPakistan is one of numerous states that have experienced cycles of civilian rule and military coups. Turkey [has had several](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/07/15/turkey-military-coup-history/87153106/), including a failed one in 2016. [One study found 475 attempted coups](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/07/22/map-the-world-of-coups-since-1950/?utm_term=.9cb00a51d2b6) worldwide since 1950, with about half succeeding- though not all coups are conducted by the military.\n\n**How have states dealt differently with this instability and the balance between military and civilian power?** Some states have had decades since their last coup, others have had them in the last few years. There is a process whereby militaries can have expanded or limited powers, with varying levels of success. An example is in Indonesia, where the military has historically had its own business holdings that provided revenue independent of the national budget. The [process of civilian regulation is complicated and incomplete](http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/whats-the-indonesian-militarys-business/).",

The [CCC] (https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44606.pdf) operates exclusively to support U.S. agriculture at the direction of the Secretary of Agriculture at the USDA.  \n\nHowever, I know of the Federal Crop Insurance Program (FCIP), which is a [program that provides US farmers with crop insurance] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Crop_Insurance_Corporation).  When natural disasters hit or agricultural commodity prices drop, as they have now, these insurance policies kick in.  These policies are overseen by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC).\n\nHow do these two corporations, both meant to support US agriculture in times of hardship, differ, and how are they similar?  \n\n\n\nedit: Struck a fact from an article that was actually from 2008.\n",

This is being called a [\"no deal\" Brexit.](https://metro.co.uk/2018/02/05/no-deal-brexit-7288751/)\n\nThe May government has [proposed a white paper on what they would like to agree to with the EU,](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/589191/The_United_Kingdoms_exit_from_and_partnership_with_the_EU_Web.pdf) however that is only one side of the negotiation, and [it may not be agreed to by the EU.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44816048)\n\nIn particular, I am curious about the Republic of Ireland / Norther Ireland Border.\n\nThe UK shares [a land border](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland%E2%80%93United_Kingdom_border) with the Republic of Ireland, which is an EU member.  \n\nUnder the Good Friday Agreement, the border has remained open with no checkpoints.  However, [parties including Ireland's Prime Minister](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/14/brexit-threatens-good-friday-agreement-irish-pm-warns) have said that Brexit could result in a hard border being enforced and violation of the agreement.\n\nThe UK government has apparently indicated [that they would not enforce a hard border in Ireland even in the event of no deal](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/uk-northern-ireland-border-brexit-eu-hard-no-deal-cabinet-irish-a8235096.html) but this has not been stated officially.\n\nWhat relevant laws govern the UK, Republic of Ireland, and EU behavior regarding the  border in the event of a 'no deal'?\n\n\n",

        "text": "The recent surge in [support for universal health care] (https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/healthcare-congress-bernie-sanders-single-payer-obamacare/533595/) has been an explosive phenomenon.  Championing this policy in the 2016 election, Senator Bernie Sanders argued for [bringing American health care closer to what other countries use](https://twitter.com/sensanders/status/787715233439682560?lang=en), demonstrating **[the wide array of advantages universal health care presents](https://www.amsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CaseForUHC.pdf) compared to America's complicated hybrid of single-payer for some and subsidies in a regulated private marketplace for others**.  The popularity he garnered served to encourage  many of his fellow progressives in Congress to publicly buy into the idea of state funded health care.  However, after he released his draft version of the policy, analysis ([1](https://www.npr.org/2017/09/14/550768280/heres-whats-in-bernie-sanders-medicare-for-all-bill) [2](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/sanders-single-payer-health-care-plan-effect-national-health-expenditures-and-federal-and-private-spending) [3](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/13/16304474/medicare-for-all-plan-cost-bernie-sanders)) revealed significant shortcomings with respect to the viability of his plan, the primary criticism being an extreme increase in the federal deficit.  It also brought up the broader question of how the U.S. would best go about establishing universal coverage.\n_____\n\nOne of the principle arguments made by Sanders and other supporters of a universal system is that [the U.S. is the only major country that doesn't guarantee health care as a right](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/29/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-us-only-major-country-doesnt-guaran/).  Yet, [this article from the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/18/upshot/best-health-care-system-country-bracket.html) reveals how diverse universal health care programs actually are despite the popularity a single-payer structure among progressive Democrats.  Interestingly, **the system that the article deemed best (by a panel voting through a bracket of various countries) was Switzerland's, which remains [largely private while also having some of the highest metrics of access, affordability (individually and nationally), and outcomes](http://fortune.com/2017/09/26/health-care-bill-obamacare-repeal-switzerland/).**  Yet despite Switzerland's advantages, the article points out how countries like Germany or the United Kingdom possess lower barriers to access by providing a large majority of health insurance through publicly funded institutions.\n\nIn addressing the failures and room for reforms in the U.S., [this article](https://medium.com/@matt_57944/a-practical-non-partisan-solution-to-americas-healthcare-crisis-9c20dfa5a06f) takes a different approach.  It argues that **by simply expanding the current Medicare reimbursement schedule (the prices that care providers can charge for certain services/goods) to a nationally mandated schedule of fees, the U.S. could get \"the best parts of the single-payer system, namely the lowered cost of medical care, while allowing the free-market principle of competition to keep utilization in check and inspire innovation among insurers and medical providers,\"** citing vastly reduced flat costs of health services in countries which have a national fee schedule such as Canada.  The author notably criticizes the fashion in which insurers in the U.S. negotiate their own prices with providers, saying that because of a section in the ACA which requires insurers to \"spend 80–85% of the premium dollars they collect on medical care for their policyholders,\" they have little incentive to negotiate for lower prices.  However, the article does present the counter argument that **a national fee schedule would reduce doctor wages and provide less incentive to enter the industry given how much student loan debt and malpractice insurance cost, as well as the inevitable loss of pharmaceutical innovation due to reduced profit potential**.  The primary barrier to pursuing a reform like this, in the view of the author, is the power of the health care lobby in Congress which shut down federal negotiation policy multiple times (even pushing policy that bans the federal government from negotiating prices altogether) and wielded a massive lobbying expenditure of $509.5 million in 2017 alone.  \n____\n\nGiven the variety of different systems currently used with all their flaws and merits, [advantages and disadvantages of the current American system](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2014/jun/mirror-mirror-wall-2014-update-how-us-health-care-system), and the desire to reduce costs and increase access and quality:\n\n1. Is there evidence that a Swiss-style system is the right or wrong way to provide adequate coverage and reduce costs while maintaining the advantages the U.S. already possesses (ex. innovation and high level care)?  Is there information suggesting that a greater degree of government health care management in the U.S. would provide benefits -- notably regarding cost to individuals and ease of access -- superior to those of a more private system (even one such as Switzerland's)?\n\n2. What reforms to the American health care system demonstrate the greatest chance of implementation by the government, and which among those reforms show evidence that they would bring about the most improvement over the status quo?  Is a national fee schedule alone an effective solution to accomplish the general goals politicians like Senator Sanders are seeking, without moving to single-payer?  Is there reason to believe more large-scale policies are politically possible and/or more beneficial?",
