        "text": "I know that there were wars in the Old Testament, but Jesus and Paul practiced nonviolent resistance, for example\n\nVideo game: The prison falls apart, Paul and Silas escape while parrying strikes from guards in their way Bible: Paul and Silas just sit there to show that they don't engage in dishonest conduct and that they have committed no crime that would justify running away\n\nI was thinking that why don't more video games put real life religions in them, and I realized besides the demographics problems that lots of video games use \"Whop the bad guys\" as the solution to injustice. Whereas in the examples of Jesus and Paul they did nothing of the sort. I know Ehud was practically a ninja but we literally use Jesus' lack of violence to show that He is above how humans act.\n\nSo even if you did mention Jesus, how would you make a game that people would actually want to play without violence, that has an actual conflict? By which I mean Frogger and Minecraft have non violent options but there is no good or evil in those games besides not dying. Mario, Zelda and Sonic have heroes and villains but the heroes only win through superior force. And before you mention Undertale the reason that game was so shocking was that its nonviolence moral made you play completely differently from most video games to do so, the exception that proves the rule.\n\nSo I mean even if you switched \"I prayed to Hylia\" to \"I prayed to God\" would that make Zelda any more Christian? Showing you're better than villains by doing what they do just for the other side?",

I'm going to post mine in the OP later because of the raw difficulty it is for me to choose. I'm assuming #1 will be your favorite and #5 the least, I'm super interested in your comments.\n\n#5 Legend of Zelda Ocarina of time: classic title and played by almost every kid born in the 90s this was a absolute golden masterpiece during its time and still holds up to this day.\n\n#4 The last of us: This one hit home for me pretty hard as did it for a lot of people I know. The fact there's a second game coming out solidify its spot at #4 for me \n\n#3 Fall out new vegas: This game was one of my first big open world games (I missed Skyrim) something about it really hit me harder then Fallout 3 and 4 it had a very different feel to it that holds a special spot in my heart after replaying this game 20+ times and beating the dlcs countless times it definitely scores the #3 spot without a doubt.\n\n#2 Bioshock: This game is simply badass no other word to use the genetic splicing the madness it really is a true game of champions. To this day I haven't met a single soul who hasn't at least gave this game 10 minutes.\n\n#1 Bloodbourne: So I could go on for a while about this game the fact it's HP Lovecraft proof and it was born out of a already bad ass trilogy which I will say the same for Bioshock. This game had a certain feel to it, something I loved about the madness and beasts the true philosophy to it and the breath taking art and game play drew me in. I've beat this game so many times I've lost count tried every build path one could go and to this day I still boot it up and replay it time to time Bloodbourne truly is my #1 favorite game period.",

        "text": "I got into an argument about genre definitions with a friend, and during our argument, he pointed out that the Witcher series didn't fit my definition of CRPG.  Namely, that there was no character creation, no party based combat, and the combat wasn't abstracted.  For example: you push a button and Geralt performs an attack.  There is no chance to hit, you don't select an enemy and run up to swing at it, or so on.\n\nNow, I know people get weird about genre names.  Some would even say CRPG isn't a legitimate term.  I'd argue that if the term can be used and is widely understood or even used by a community, then it is a legitimate term.  One could complain that the name doesn't adequately describe the genre, but 'adventure game' wouldn't exactly make a non-gamer think of a point and click game where you hunt for items used to solve puzzles.  The name may not adequately indicate what it is used to describe, but most gamers know what kind of games you are talking about when the term is used.\n\nAt any rate, I'm curious to hear what others think.  I've always mentally lumped the Witcher series in with other CRPGs, because so much of it is similar to other aspects of the genre, and because I enjoy the games so much, but by my own definition it doesn't fit.  Even Mass Effect had some party based combat, and I really wouldn't call those CRPGs.  You also got to customize your Sheppard to be who you wanted.  Geralt is just Geralt.\n\nAnd, yeah, I really don't know if I would call the games Action RPGs or ARPGs.  I feel like games such as Diablo and Dark Souls more adequately define that genre, though I can't really say why.  Perhaps the lack of major NPC interaction?  Gah, what a headache trying to square all these little subgenres can be.",

        "text": "This is a topic that is often brought up on gaming forums, but very rarely seems to bring out much objective or nuanced discussion. Nintendo's approach to the hardware, features and the services it offers to its users has understandably frustrated fans who expect a user experience comparable to what is offered by Sony and Microsoft. Unfortunately, this has caused most discussions to boil down to vitriolic claims that \"Nintendo is out of touch\" or that its leadership is clueless. \n\n\nI hope this thread can thread can foster a more objective discussion about why Nintendo takes such a peculiar approach to their services compared to other companies, and why this has continued despite an overarching trend of a shrinking marketshare. I can think of numerous examples off the top of my head, namely:\n\n\n* Reluctance to adopt CD-ROMs as a storage medium with the Nintendo 64\n* Limiting the storage format to mini-discs on the GameCube\n* Lack of DVD or Blu Ray playback on later consoles\n* Lack of HD compatibility with the Wii \n* Slowness to adopt an online service and failure to fix what most saw as an incredibly outdated system\n* Lack of a unified account system to save downloaded games\n* The recent debacle with the baffling smartphone app\n\n\nThe list goes on. What I would like to know is why exactly this has gone on for over twenty years with no apparent change in strategy. Many point to the first item in the list as the root cause of Nintendo's loss of market dominance, but one would think that this would have triggered a complete change in Nintendo's openness to market trends in later console cycles. How can we explain this? Is it company culture? Is it the governing philosophy of a powerful leadership figure within the company? \n\n\nI've seen some suggest that it is simply that Nintendo is less knowledgeable about trends in other markets because they are a Japanese company. I'm not satisfied with this explanation. Besides the obvious counterexample of Sony, Sega was also well ahead of the curve in terms of technology and features during their heyday. Can anyone offer some insight?  \n\n",

There is one game that had stuck out to me for years now though. From what I remember there was an opening sequence that went something like this, a man was in a diner or bar, he was sitting at the counter when either on TV or at the actual diner someone had pulled out a vinnel CD(I think?) and they started playing it, he had been watching and he jumps up and yells for them not to play it when things suddenly get crazy and what looks like spirits suddenly show up and he's knocked out, after a while he wakes up and you can move around and leave the bar/diner and one of the first encounters you have is with a monster-like lady with giant claws lunges out of the window dressed in red.

        "text": "I've been thinking about Marvel's film strategy and the rumored splinter cell / ghost recon crossover mission and I can't help but wonder if videogames could ever become a \"cant-miss-it event\" like Infinity War was. I love the idea of characters we've gotten to know and love interacting with one another and bringing their own particular offering to the table. Videogames often split player control over different characters with different abilities in order to keep gameplay fresh, so combining slightly different genres and their respective characters seems like a great fit. Obviously this means you have to hone multiple play systems (I.e. have good stealth, and have good gunplay) but with enough attention I feel like it's possible, especially if those respective refined control systems are just imported in from prior installments.\n\n\n\nOne thing that I think could work is a mash up of Dino Crisis and Resident Evil. Both IPs are survival horror, both owned by CAPCOM and it's an easy tie-in. The dino crisis lab that fucked with time travel could be a subsidiary of Umbrella looking for new BOW's. It's up to Regina and Leon to work together to stop the proliferation of dinos and plague-zombies. \n\n\n\nObviously there's a limit on what universes you could combine, but it's fun to consider.\n\nWhat if the Doom Marine was teleported to a certain space ring installation teaming up with a certain other armor-suited sci-fi badass? Glory kills on Elites? Yes please!\n\n\nAlso, what if during an operation to infiltrate a compound and kill a third-world dictator in the making Sam Fisher meets a mysterious professional known only as 47? ",

        "text": "I like reviewing games, in my head most of the time, but sometimes in written form. I absolutely cannot stand walking simulators or games that put story/visuals over fun gameplay. I feel I may be overly harsh and biased against things like journey, oxenfree, telltale games, and even uncharted. Can/should people review games in generas that are not their cup of tea? If so, how? \n\n\n\n\nI'd like to come up with a review rubrik. Whenever I say reviews the rubrik seems to be: gameplay, sound, visuals/performance, story, etc... Growing up I'd always been the type that only cared about gameplay, and didn't care about story, visuals, and music as long as they weren't so bad as to actively detract from the experience. Now that I'm older I do have more of an appreciation for those other things, but not nearly to the extent that everyone else seems to. (gamexplain's derek spent a whole minute in his review playing a song from the donkey kong tropical freeze level gushing about it, which felt asanine to me - especially considering I was not impressed by the piece he chose.)\n\n\n\nAnyway, back to the points: 1) Can/should people review games in generas that are not their cup of tea? If so, how? 2) can we try and come up with some sort of grading rubrik? Might have to be modified depending on genera.\n\n\n\nLastly, I'd like to submit my grading scale. It is scored out of 5, but it's a ten point scale as it allows for 0.5's.\n\n\n1-star (shit): No redeeming qualities. This game is boring and sucks in just about every way possible. \n\n2-star (aka, \"meh, it’s OK\"): One or two redeeming qualities. If you concentrate on the redeeming qualities and have nothing else to play,  you’re not completely wasting your time on this game. You'll likely never want to play this again, but it was ok while it lasted. \n\n3-star (aka Decent): Acceptable game, about average. \n\n4-star (aka good game): This game is pretty good, but not life-changing. Most players and critics usually agree on the quality of these games even if it's not their cup of tea.\n\n5-star (aka video game hall of fame): This is the kind of game that is consistently brought up as people's \"favorite game of all time.\" Hopefully no further explanation is necessary. It deserves to be in the gaming Hall of Fame. VERY FEW GAMES ARE 5-STARS, about 1-5% of them. \n\nOther category:\n\n0-star (aka, broken abomination): The lowest of the low. A 1-star (shit) that's riddled with bugs and performance issues qualifies as a 0. The developers should all be out of a job.\n\n\nI think it makes more sense to people that 3 is decent rather than 6. 6 is generally seen as a bad score. Similarly, If I gave a game a 4/10 rather than a 2/5, I would understand why people would not take my opinion seriously because 4/10 by traditional standards may seem overly harsh than what I'm trying to portray with 2/5. No one would think of a 4/10 game as “ok.” So I can grade out of 5 to more accurately convey my thoughts, while still effectively using a ten point scale.\n\n\nI think the fact that in our school system anything below a 70 is a failing grade, we're all kind of programed to think of games the same way. This makes a scale out of ten confusing and suboptimal. Though, I think my scoring system can also be thought of as 1=6, 2=7, 3=8, 4=9, 5=10 and anything 5 or below is a zero. I guess I could just grade from 6-10 using 0.5's making it a ten point scale that actually allows for a 10. ",

Upon reflection I greatly appreciate this design choice because\nit gives players time to navigate the world in the early game without relying on it.\n\nThey also carefully timed it with the world becoming less linear and opening up a bit in the following section.  However having gotten used to exploration I opted to keep the compass toggled off and had no problems finding where i needed to go.\n\nWith games looking as beautiful as they are now it's a shame when the Waypoint Compass draws our eyes and keeps players from immersing themselves in the artwork on display all around them.\n\nHave any other games put off enabling the compass this way?  And can bigger open worlds benefit from this too, or is it only possible for a semi open world like God of War? \n\nTL;DR \nthis clip sums up my feelings on the matter \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IleDJvtm2g0",

        "text": "Hello. In this post i would like to share my opinion on RPGs, or how i think we should define RPGs. I hope that you will share your opinion and critique mine.\n\nSkyrim is a pretty well known game, even among \"casual\" gamers. It has great reviews and i think few people consider it a bad game. I find Skyrim's leveling system addicting. However, i do not like calling Skyrim an RPG.\n\nThink about your dialogue choices in Skyrim. How many times did you feel that you directly impacted the world? The speech tree in Skyrim is useless for speech itself, and is only valuable for the money traits you can get. The game even allows you to be member of every guild without any conflict, which feels really weird.\n\nI think that games that just because a game has stats and classes is should NOT be considered an RPG. The players ability to impact the story/world should be the main factor in defining an RPG, and by impacting the story i don't mean just the freedom to kill all the NPCs.\n\nSo what i am trying to say is: There needs to be specific terms for RPGs that have dialogue choices that can meaningfully impact the story and the world of the game, and games that are just fantasy. Example: World of Warcraft should not be considered an RPG.\n\nI hope that this posts do not sound like i am trying to crap on people who do not enjoy games the way i do. It's just that i love the dialogue system in New Vegas, being able to talk your way out of entire quests and boss fights! We need more of this. \n\nI know subreddits like gamingcirclejerk joke about New Vegas. I just don't want this kind of RPGs to die :)",

        "text": "I do have a question of what you guys think about videogame NPCs. Are they useful? Do you usually hire one in games like Skyrim, Fallout, or Far Cry? I always did in Skyrim because I just wanted someone to carry all my crap.\n\nI've enjoyed having companion NPCs, but it just happens over and over in Bethesda games that they just get lost and show up at some random time when I needed an item they were carrying. However, I always liked having extra firepower at the beginning of the game. It tends to make beginning sections much easier, but I couldn't help but feeling like I should probably avoid them if I wanted the 'true' gaming experience. \n\nFar Cry 5 companions have been a bit better, but don't seem to have a whole ton of personality. I did like Fallout 4's mechanics where you can really become close with the companion over time. That's probably the only time I felt like I was gaining a true relationship with somebody like Piper. \n\nI accidentally ran over my Far Cry 5 NPC Cliff Edwards, and decided to make a video about all the great things he did \\(or not\\). Framed it like he was leaving me for another player. Any feedback or suggestions you have would be great. And subscribe if you enjoy! I had a good time making it, and would like help improving.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9WkT\\_xZa\\-A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9WkT_xZa-A)",

        "author": "MrMarbles77",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8hndoe/gaming_personalities_overemphasizing_their_fandom/",
        "text": "I was watching a Q &amp; A video with Karak from the YouTube channel ACG, and he was talking about how much he gets asked about why he's not suffering burn-out, and how many other public-facing people talk to him about getting tired of always being \"on\" for the public. His comment on this was that he was just this way all the time so he never put on a different personality for the camera.  \n\nWhich connected with some other stuff I've been thinking about, specifically how a lot of \"gaming personalities\" (I'd include here anyone that appears regularly on Youtube, Twitch, or their own media outlet) tend to over-exaggerate how much of a fan they are, and how they are a \"real gamer\". I wonder if it's necessary, does this make the content more compelling, or does it set unrealistic expectations of how dedicated to gaming you need to be, and how excited you should feel by everything gaming related?\n\nNow to be clear, this is NOT any kind of witch-hunting topic, and all of the people I mention are personalities that I like to at least some degree, certainly more than people I'm not naming, These are all people I'm going to go back to at some point for more content. But I think examples help:\n\n*  Brandon Jones of Easy Allies comes across as a massive Red Dead Redemption fan. He's been talking up the new game for years, and it's certainly been mentioned as his most anticipated new game. In the live streamed reaction video to the new trailer release, which is over an hour of him re-watching and slowing down and pausing the new trailer, it apparently took him half an hour to recognize the face of John Marston, protagonist of the previous game present in almost every cutscene. Jones has also gushed about Witcher 3, calling it one of the greatest games ever made, how excited he is for the new game from the studio, etc, but when someone asks him about the highly acclaimed expansions to the game, he's said he's had them downloaded for years but just hasn't gotten around to playing them.\n\n* Happy Console Gamer says he is a massive fan of the Ys series, he's made tons of videos about it and says one his main reasons for starting his channel, which has been going on for 10 years now, is to make sure a series like Ys is not forgotten. In one of his videos he talks about how happy he is that an old Ys game (possibly Ys Origin?) was finally put on PS4 so he can play it, even though it's been on Steam for years. This is a pretty basic game that any decent laptop should be able to handle, certainly whatever he uses to edit his videos. He's also constantly talking about and showing off all the Collector's Edition stuff he orders on a whim, so I don't think he's hurting for money. He did mention in another video borrowing someone else's laptop for the weekend to play another game in the Ys series, but I have trouble thinking of a \"hardcore fan\" as someone  who won't play one of the main games in the series if they have to play it on a device they're less comfortable with.\n\n* I recently watched the video Jesse Cox made about Battle Chasers since I had started playing the game, was impressed, and wanted to hear other people's opinions. Jesse starts ranting wildly about how Battle Chasers is one of his favourite things ever, how much of an impression the comics made when he was growing up, etc, basically he's a salivating #1 fan. Then when he starts playing he skims over the story parts, ignores the tips and instructions, and starts explaining and using the systems inaccurately because he didn't read the 2-sentence long explanations. Rather than a super-fan taking their time to appreciate the work and dig into the details, it seemed like someone just wanting to speed through it. I also watched some of his Dead Space videos a while back, and he kept insisting strongly that he wasn't playing on Easy like commenters were mentioning, then later on he said it \"might be a bug\" that set it to easy when he didn't want it. This apparently is an actual bug that exists, but it was interesting how strongly he was trying to emphasize that he didn't want to play on easy, even though he seemed to be having a fun time otherwise.\n\n* Patrick Klepek, who I used to follow more when he was at Giant Bomb, would talk about Kentucky Route Zero a *lot*, mentioning it as a real quality release, that did a lot of interesting innovative things, etc. Then I was watching some more informal stream and someone asked him a question and he said he'd only played the first episode, when there were at least three out at the time, and they had been out for a long time. Again, doesn't really sound like it's that good of a game if you can't be bothered to want to play any more episodes.\n\nObviously this isn't exclusive to games. Youtube movie critic Chris Stuckmann is infamous for always starting a review of any franchise movie by saying he grew up with it and was a massive fan as a kid, and is a long-time fan today. This extended to his review of the racial drama Get Out by saying that he grew up around some black people, showing a picture as proof, and saying that he's been a big fan of racial equality for a long time.\n\nRe-reading this, I didn't think it would be this long, and again my intent is certainly not to try to tear down people's \"gamer cred\" or call them phonies.\n\nMy concern is more with maybe that our idea of a gamer or passionate gamer is not realistic, and these people have to present themselves to the public as being more excited and passionate than they actually are. Is it really good for video gaming at large to present this image of always being hyped up for the brand new thing? Currently, are 100% of the people in gaming media really playing through the new God of War and enjoying it thoroughly? What would happen if someone just said on the record that they weren't into it, or didn't think it was worth their time or that they might get to it in a year or two?",

It's just a really pretentious, wannabe filmmaker way of saying our game doesn't have loading screens. When Half Life 2 came out, did the devs say yeah our game is \"single shot\" since the camera is always from Gordon's perspective from the beginning to the end. No they didn't, because it's a game. Games don't have \"shots\". Does someone actually play games like this? Do you play a level of Call of Duty and think \"wow, it was so amazing how this level was presented in one single take, like in a movie\", because no shit it's unbroken, it's gameplay.\n\nlike am I crazy but does this Polygon article just sound insane and obvious?\n\n&gt;But 2018’s God of War keeps you pinned to Kratos, and the camera shows you the game’s immensity by showing how things would look from his perspective. And the camera doesn’t blink or cut away; *if Kratos experiences something, you are experiencing it as well.*\n\nthat is... literally every game ever? why do they make such a big deal out of it. pretty much every 3rd and 1st person game you play the camera is from the protagonists perspective.\n\nyeah God of War might not have a single \"cut\" in the game but all these articles make it sound like the games camera did something revolutionary just by not having loading screens.  I wouldn't even care about any of this if the title of the article was \"God of War doesn't have loading screens\", I just think the idea of games having \"shots\" like movies/tv is ridiculous. Games shouldn't use the vocabulary of film since they're two different mediums. ",

        "text": "EDIT: Playing vs bots is not the best way to learn, if you're really terrible in normal games, this could be an alternative play without the feeling of being helpless and always on the bottom of the leaderboard. Playing vs better players is the way to go.\n\nA lot of times I see in MP forums people asking if they should play competitive once they reach the requirement. Most top answers say that you should just go straight on and you'll get whatever rank you deserve and work from that.\n\nI completely disagree with this kind of learning. I think that if you truly want to get better you should wait a bit and learn the game's workings before going comp.\n\nIn most games I play, I prefer a more standard, slower type of learning (RPGs or linear games I can't really do that and don't need to). This is how it will look like roughly: I start by playing the tutorial and mastering the basic mechanics. Then I go to a practice range or a sandbox mode (if there is) where I experiment with every variable to see how the game's systems interact with each other. After that I select a game of bots with medium difficulty (with also mixing a normal game here and there). Whether I get stomped or breeze through, I choose the next appropriate difficulty and do it until I beat the hardest setting the game offers. After that I play unranked and if I feel prepared to up the challenge I finally arrive to competitive. And most likely I get an average or above average rank. I try to absorb as much of the game's content there is, tutorials, guides, pro twitch streams, etc.\n\nLet's get an example (A). You play Overwatch for the first time and you learn how most characters work at a basic level. You go to competitive after hitting the required level 25 and get the rank, Bronze, the lowest division. You don't have terrible aim but you still have no idea how most of the game works, don't know all the map's intricacies and the game just loaded a map you've never seen, still don't know how that 2 or 3 heroes work, you know you need to capture the point or push the payload to win, so you go and do it and still die almost every time.\n\nAfter a lot of practice you're still stuck, why? Because you're playing with people who also play bad. You only improve by playing against better players and learning from mistakes. So you get punished and rightfully so for not taking it easy and making a huge effort just to get an average rank where a person who's more patient and deliberate will likely get it in equal or even less time. \n\nOther side of the example (B). You play OW for the first time and hit level 25. You feel like there's still a ton of stuff to learn. You already played in the highest difficulty with bots and you are competent enough to beat them. Good. What's the next step? Learning everything, which is not really possible since pros too learn something every day though on a much more micro scale. I mean by going into custom game and loading every single map and explore the shit out of them, the layouts, the health packs and the objective. Play at least 10 games on every hero to see how they interact with each other. Practice the aim, lower sensitivity and play mccree/genji/pharah/tracer on harmless bots. If you're good or really like a specific character play them on deathmatch all the time since it's a useful tool for learning combat dynamics. Meanwhile that you can read about the game, the game's subreddit/forums, guides, twitch, POV reviews, community interaction and maybe some funny moments montages because the games are ultimately for fun.\n\nAfter doing all that for a reasonable amount of time, say 50 hours (for a MP game that is very little) you feel ready to go competitive and finally get the rank, Gold or Platinum, realistically. And there you go, you saved a huge potential hassle of wasting time on lower ranks and get a nice starting ground. It will feel easier to improve on mid ranks since people probably have decent aim already and a general feel for the game.\n\nOf course this doesn't apply to everyone, some people will very quickly learn the game and get a high rank without much time invested, others, like most people including me aren't that good in FPS games and will take a huge amount of time to get a decent rank, that's life. \n\nWhat do you think, do you agree or what I'm saying is crazy because it's just a game and you just play it, don't make a huge plan or strategy out of it?\n\n",

The developers said that the character's \"evil\" acts are supposed to make you consider why you made those decisions and why you play violent games.

I've applied this to God of War (2018), Streets of Rage a Beat 'em up, ARPGs like Kingdom Hearts, Survival Horrors, and Third Person Shooters. Another example is that after playing Final Fantasy XIII, a game with significant emphasis on status effects, I at least look at the various buffs and debuffs in a game to see if they could be worthwhile. Sometimes they still aren't, but in other games like Persona 5 they are invaluable on higher difficulties.\n\nAre there any games/genres that you have played where a tactic, strategy, or thought process you learned could be applied to another game/genre?

        "text": "Honestly, video game designers are so full of themself it gives me the willies! They force the player to play games like they have them intended. What would be ok in the 90s where I can understand it at some point due to technical limitations, it's in todays standards just an absolute No-Go and a sign of bad game design.\n\nEvery game should be designed like the player feels like to play the game. Lately I played through some of the annoying minigames in Yakuza-Zero. I know most of the time they are optional, but some of the rewards are just to good to be left out, as such I feel obligated to play through some of the them, even when they are way to difficult. \nAt example there is a rhythm dance minigame in the game, where you have to press buttons at the right time, I'm not good in this kind of stuff, so I'm feeling left out because the game forces me at some point in a quest line to beat that particular challenge. \n\nThat's totally irresponsible I paid money for that damn game so I earned the right to see all of its content if I want to! I mean when I buy a book I wouldn't expect to answer some questions before I can read it to the end, that's what bothers me for most of the time in the videogame industustry, it's totally dumb and elitistic to expect that every kind of player has to beat a arbitrary challenge to see the game to the end or for further content.\nEven optional tasks like that one in Yakuza aren't really optional, because it contains content I will never ever experience if I don't get over those meaningless \"skills checks\". \n\nThat's the reason why I play Dark Souls on pc, which allows me to install a mod to turn my character into god mode, I'm really into the aestethics of dark souls, but I hate how the designers force egoistically there principles to the players. Dying in that game is a complete waste of time with their far apart \"checkpoints\" what's wrong about granting the player a saving option for saving all the time when I feel like? I really can't understand anyone who defend such doofus design decisions, it would take nothing away from the game, it's just plain elitism by not allowing - someone without much time to binge the game all day - to proceed\n\nI can understand if there are some players who need those challenges for feeling satisfaction, but honestly when I seek challenges I play a game called \"real life\". \nVideo games are for fun as such there are many different players who seek fun in their own way. \nGamers like me who enjoy dark souls for their enviroments and for the satisfaction of beating bad guys with its combat system, are feeling totally left out. \nNow in \"God-Mode\" I finally have all of the game for me, without worrying about dying all of the time by those totally overpowered bosses, where I have to run miles again and again. \n\nWhy do developers hesitate by allowing such modes from the start? I mean it's COMPLETELY optional. You don't have to use it  when you don't want and such I don't have to torture me though the game it's a fair bargain and honestly the only right decision, everything else is just intolerant. \n\nImagine players with disabilitys who wan't to play the game? How can they do if the game constantly asks impossible tasks for them, even on easy mode mode. It's totally not fair! Video games have a long way to go, to enable fairness and fun for everyone.\n\nAt least I played one good example quite a while, it's a plattformer game called Celeste.\nTo be honest, I'm not really into plattformers because most of the get absurdly difficult and unfair and celeste is no exception after the first 2 chapters BUT, they give you an assist mode, which allows you to play the game how you want. \nHave problems with a particular obstacle? No problem just turn yourself invincible or slow the game down, you can switch the difficulty just right for you, all the time.\nHating some Level because it builds up on an annoying feature? Absolutey ok, the game allows you to skip any annoying chapter. \nAs such I was able to enjoy the whole story to it's fullest which wouldn't be possible for me otherwise. So yeah, I usually don't play plattformers, because most of them are still made by elitistic game developers who force you to 'git gud' (look at you Super Meat Boy) but I would consider my decisions if everyone of them would be like Celeste. \n\nReally, there is nothing which is exclusively for some \"chosen-players\" in the game I reached all of the achievments and sometimes I played some of the later screens without using assistant mode, at least I was feeling totally fine and that's most important. \nI was able to experience the game in 4 hours, which would have taken instead 30 hours or more of my time.\nI have a decent job, a family and other business to do, I'm not the youngest and as such I feel disrespected if games waste my time with obnoxious difficulty. \nEvery gamer who complains about more optional settings, keeping the fun away from others, is just purely immature.\n\n*tl:dr*\nVideogames should be accesible to anyone, with allowing you to skip every obstacle if you want to and customize your experience how you feel like. Games are for fun, and nothing steals your fun just because someone made the game easier for himself. Videogames are overall still an ignorant and elitistic medium which excludes player if they don't want to play by the rules which the developer laid out.\n\nI hope that you people here are reasonable, if the sub is called \"truegaming\" I would except most of you should be aware of good game design and the more player can have fun with a game, the better that game is designed. \n\nIn another sub some of these \"elitists\"  were stating that it would take them \"something\" away if they always have the option to skip a section. I bet they just don't have enough self-restraint to keep them away to use such options, but I think it's just their fault, they don't have to use it. Easy as pie.\n\n\n",

        "text": "Hey All. I have a few ideas for a dark fantasy RPG (working title: Project Thorn), and I’m struggling to think of a sold combat system that I’d like to implement. My main inspirations for this game are Hyper Light Drifter, Hollow Knight, Dead Cells and Salt and Sanctuary, so I’m ultimately setting out to design a vast interconnected world with a memorable environment and real time exploration. But I’d also like to implement a party system of a similar vein to other fantasy RPGs, so I’m debating with myself over the right way to do that; how to properly have the player explore with a single character while also emphasizing the theme of camaraderie in a desolate and hostile world.\n\nBelow are some of the mechanic ideas that I had, so I’d really appreciate some input from you guys on the matter. I’ll also be including a poll link if that’d be easier for you guys.\n\nTURN BASED STRATEGY COMBAT (when coming in contact with an enemy, the gameplay switches over to a turn based action screen)\n\nTurn Based Strategy with Timed Button Mashing: encouraging a variety of button combos to increase damage or defense against enemies, and unlocking more combinations for each of your characters the further you level up (Paper Mario or Mario and Luigi)\n\nActive Time Battle System: properly timing when and how to attack, and unlocking more time to attack on the timer bar on the bottom screen and a variety of other actions the further you level up (Grandia or Child of Light)\n\nREAL TIME STRATEGY COMBAT\n\nRouge Like Action RPG: having you explore and fight in real time, but also equipping you with a single interchangeable companion that acts solely as a secondary attack (mix between Hyper Light Drifter and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night)\n\nOn The Fly Character Switching: having you explore and fight in real time, but allowing you to swap your character out for another party member to perform a different moveset (mix between Shantae: Friends to the End and Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin)\n\nAgain, thanks for the input here, and I’ll be open to any commentary that you have on the matter. \n\nPoll: https://www.strawpoll.me/15634339\n",

        "text": "I love story-driven games and I'm incredibly fond of RPGs in particular, but I've always felt there's this dissonance between collecting gear to improve your character and moving forward with the story; you have to balance wanting to make your character stronger (or just complete the extra objectives in a game) with wanting to know what happens next. \n\nIn many RPGs you don't *need* to grind or level-up or get the **Magical Ultimate Weapon of +5 Kill** in order to beat the final boss, but I've played multiple games where I felt like the urgency behind the main quest doesn't mesh with the freedom that a game gives you. This was my main beef with *The Witcher 3* and one of the reasons why I think I liked *Final Fantasy XV* more than a lot of people. I liked the fact that the later portion of FFXV basically said, \"Yo. You need to go fight the bad guy *now*. You can't go collect frogs and take pictures anymore.\" \n\nThe backlash to FFXV (and to linear restrictions in open-world games in general) made me think about how game developers can bridge this gap between giving the player the freedom to go do side quests and spend their time doing less important things while simultaneously raising the stakes and making the main quest feel important. \n\nWhat games have balanced freedom with narrative urgency well? What games haven't? \n\nHow would you handle this issue in a game? ",

        "text": "I hear a lot of people talking about the dvorak keyboard and how it would be so much better than the qwerty except we all have muscle memories that would be painful to override. I have similar thoughts about the gamepad. I feel like the xbox/PS version that we have is just a natural evolution of what we had growing up and that it might not be the best design we could have if we were to start from scratch today. As I thought experiment, here is what I would change if I could override all my 30 years of gaming habits:\n\n- Why is the directional cross or the joystick to control the movements is on the right and the buttons for the actions on the left? Most of people are right-handed and thus more agile with their right hand. Shouldn’t it be the opposite? You need more finesse to control your character than to smash an action button, don’t you?\n\n- Talking about the D-pad, since when did you used it as it was initially designed? Nowadays everybody use the left joystick to control the direction. No one is using the d-pad other than for switching weapons or such. Maybe it should be replaced by something more appropriate for today’s use like a mouse wheel for instance.\n\n- We have 10 fingers, why are the gamepads designed to use only 4 of them: the two thumbs and the 2 indexes? Yeah, I know, some people also use the middle fingers for the shoulder buttons but it feels like a lost opportunity to not use the other fingers. Maybe it would feel natural in some situation to squeeze the gamepad, wouldn’t it?\n\nThat just some of my thoughts. Do you have any?\n",

When you compare it to Every Frame a Painting's video [on music in the MCU and movies today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vfqkvwW2fs), I think video game talent is producing the best scores around.\n\nI know I'm cherry picking here but where are the cherries to pick from other media?\n\nIf video game scores are besting their competition, why might this be?  If the EFAP video is to be believed, a lot of movie music loses its personality in the editing booth, and perhaps as games can't be edited, the music can do its work in setting the scene?  Is it because with the success of things like Guardians of the Galaxy that movies have put a greater emphasis on soundtrack rather than original scores?  (see also: Baby Driver)  \n\nLet's all give a shout out to the video game musicians, songwriters and composers--as well as all of the audio engineers--that do some of the best work today!",

Since they’re keep pouring the money to them anyway.\n\nFrom what I understand about “vote with wallet” is one person stop support certain company isn’t enough, a group of customer stop support the company would show some effect, its give the company the signal that we want something else, so they have to become better.

I wanted to get your ideas on the importance of art style in video games as opposed to technical graphics. :) I've been exploring this topic myself as I'm making a video but would love to get some other opinions to consider. \n\nE.g. stylized graphics vs photo realism - games like Super Mario World (SNES) are heavily stylized BUT distinct and timeless (still play this game even though it's older than me!). Games like Assassin's Creed (more realistic visuals) tend to be outdated as soon as new tech/installment in the series comes out. Still possible for games to be good with realistic graphics of course, but i think original visuals really make an impact. Overall atmosphere (I believe) involves mainly audio and visuals. Which makes a game immersive in my opinion, but how important do you guys think style is?\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much! You really got me thinking about this topic and honestly I was blown away by the responses, I've finally completed the video if you're interested but I am an amateur so I'm sorry! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTPpMYCfxKc",

        "text": "This thread is inspired from a post in r/WoWClassic where the differences in design between the original version of the game and modern version of the game have been discussed on end, and not just the game but the industry as a whole for that matter.\n\nI've found myself becoming quite tired of Daily/Weekly rewards constantly pushing for my playing experience and decisions made in game to be made for me in checklist format. Also the feeling of 'missing out' if you missed yesterday's or last weeks cap, it's something that can never be made up. What if I can't play for 4 days, but have 6 hours to sit down Saturday and do something that would have a daily cap on it? It has killed my enjoyment of many games.\n\nAnyway, just curious what your thoughts are on this design that so many games have adopted. For clarification \"BC\" is the first expansion to come out that many think changed the overall design of the game, and Vanilla is obviously the original version. [Here is the post I'll quote below](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8ftwjl/jeff_kaplan_we_dont_want_you_charging_through/dy79vj4/?context=4):\n\nIt's not about the number of hours. It's about the design philosophy and the psychology behind it. Grinding during vanilla was an open thing you could do whenever you wanted.  During BC, the model shifted to \"log in every day and perform an identical task to avoid loss from opportunity cost.\" \n\nSure, maybe grinding out gold in vanilla was grindy. But for example, it didn't matter _how_ you did it. If you wanted to mine ore, that was fine. if you wanted to play the auction house, that was fine. If you wanted to do tribute runs, that was fine. If you leveled an alchemy/hebalism alt, that reduced your need for gold in the first place.\n\nAnd it didn't matter _when_ you did your grinding. If you wanted to do an hour a day, you could. If your Tuesdays and Thursdays were busy, you could skip those days. If because of real life you could only play on weekends, you could completely skip 5 days and then sit down for 8 hour grinding sessions all at once. It didn't matter.\n\nIn some cases it didn't even matter which character you did your grinding on. If you wanted incendosaur scales or dark iron residue or cloth or whatever for rep turn-ins on your main, a lot of the time you could grind out those drops on a lower level alt who'd receive xp for the kills, and then simply mail them over.\n\nBC did away with all of that, by turning dungeons and daily reputation and gold quests into a time-limited resource. _Like a mobile game_.\n\nIf you wanted Ogri-la rep or whatever, you had to log in every day and pull the lever. And if you missed a day, you forever lost your allotment for that day. If you had a life that kept you from playing on weeknights, you were forever behind everyone who could log in every day, and there was simply nothing you could do about it besides accept the permanent loss, or alter your life in order to be able to compulsively log on and pull the lever every day.\n\nThis is _mobile game_ game design. _\"You have this many hours to pull the lever, or else you forever lose your chance! Play now and do the thing to avoid missing out!\"_\n\nDeliberate psychological manipulation to generate addictive, compulsive behavior. BC was basically a [negative reinforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement#Negative_reinforcement) based [Skinner box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber) with the fear of permanent loss instead of electric shocks, with a daily cycle designed to keep the game on your mind _every single day_, and the tasks being performed _always the same_ in order to most effectively employ [Pavlovian conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning).\n\n",

The GOAT test shows this happy vault is not so happy after all, and once you emerge into the wasteland, there is no text popping up to tell you what's out there. You are greeted with a desolate wasteland and some interesting landmarks to make your way to.\n\nThen Skyrim. Any other fantasy game would open with an animated video showing the backstory, but not this game. You are in a cart, imprisoned. You learn that a rebellion is going on because its leader is right next to you, some Thalmor and Imperials are in cahoots and they don't do things by the book here, deciding to execute you despite the fact that you're innocent. Then a dragon attacks, and you learn more of the world from there.\n\nFallout 4 too, to an extent. How are we introduced to the main factions? The Minutemen are down to their last guy, who just wants to help a group of people find a new home despite the suicidal odds against them. The Railroad are discovered by following an ancient trail that almost no-one would know of, and then get greeted by a dude who's been following you around. Whispers and rumors of the Institute spread fear and paranoia in the people, but once you get there, it's clean and beautiful like a scientific utopia. And the Brotherhood; they don't need a two minute long conversation displaying their power. They appear, in the sky, in an armored behemoth ready to conquer the Commonwealth. Now that is an introduction!\n\nSay what you want about Bethesda's storytelling, but when it comes to showing you the plot through actions rather than endless lines of texts, they excel at it.",

        "text": "I was thinking back to my very first Zelda game (that I played all the way through to the end anyway.) When it struck me what, among its lauded features, doesn't get as much attention but I thought was critical to my enjoyment of it. Atmosphere.\n\nSee, up to that point in my life, the game's I played consisted of things like _Banjo Kazooie_, _Diddy Kong Racing_, _Kirby 64_, and _Mario Party_. Games that were fun and had character but didn't really draw you into them. Perhaps this is something most gamers experience in one form or another, the same way others did the same with _Half-Life_. In any case though, Wind Waker actually drew me into its setting. Despite the deliberately cartoony aesthetic on top of it being a fantasy world, the Great Sea and its many islands felt solid and real. Outset Island had a real hometown feel to it, Dragon Roost Island actually felt like a cultural center for the Rito, and the Forest Haven lived up to its name as a cozy and magical hideaway from the world. People oft complain about the sailing and its length but it honestly never bothered me, I loved it. The length actually helped in a lot of ways, it made travelling from place to place actually feel like a journey and as one who grew up on an island and around boats, I could almost feel the spray of the sea and smell the fresh salty air.\n\nOf course the atmosphere wasn't limited to good places. Part of what made the Forbidden Woods a delightfully chilling dungeon was how off putting it was. With Dragon Roost cavern, you were given some context, this was a path that young Rito were supposed to take. With this though, the threat had been built up by how the Koroks talked about it and the very name, this is a place you're not supposed to be in. Between the shadowy interior and tall grass, you just can't help but check over your shoulder while traversing it. The worst of these by far for me is the Earth Temple, where its subterranean cavernous nature and ghoulish occupants made me claustrophobic and paranoid to the point I needed help from my brother either to just sit there with me or play it for me.\n\nI needn't even mention the soundtrack, which is one of the major elements of why the game's atmosphere works so well as each locations' song fits so well with the mood they create.\n\nWhat are your guy's thoughts on this particular example of immersion and atmosphere and do you have an example of another game that does the same for you?",

        "text": "Before you downvote, at least hear me out.\n\nAs much as we all hate loot boxes, they've brought upon us a time where, for the first time ever, both game makers and shareholders want the same thing: for people to keep playing their game. \n\nGames are a way to entertain. They're a form of art \\(and the most beautiful in my opinion\\), just like painting, music, or film. When somebody creates art, they do it to express themselves. They also want people to experience and enjoy their art, especially when that art is a game or a movie. \n\nBig publishing corporations are prevalent in the industry because selling games can be lucrative. \n\nIf you think about AAA games in the late 2000s, early 2010s, the publishers and their shareholders had no reason to want people to keep playing their games past its launch. That would require more resources to support their game post\\-launch, and outside of DLC, there wasn't a ton of money to be made.\n\nIn the past, shareholders didn't care if people stayed, as long as they hit those initial sales figures. \n\nBut now, shareholders make the most of their money off of microtransactions in games. They want the gamers to stay in their games. The more people who play your games, the more people there are that will buy your boxes. \n\nThis has manifested itself in sketchy ways, with games trying to trick the consumer or giving them a competitive advantage by spending money. DLC guns or statistically superior variants in Call of Duty games. The recent SWBF2 debacle where progression was done completely through their loot boxes. \n\nBut, there are games out there that do it right, in my opinion. Games like Rocket League and Fortnite stand out to me. \n\nFortnite doesn't have loot boxes, per se, but it does have very high priced cosmetic items \\(upwards of $20 for a single skin\\). But, these skins offer no competitive advantages and free players can be just as skilled as paid players. \n\nRocket League's system involves crates that can be acquired over the course of playing the game, that cost money to open. Everything in those crates are purely cosmetic. Unfortunately, they are random, but you can potentially get an extremely badass car, or decal, or goal explosion, or boost trail for less than a dollar, if you get lucky. \n\nThe microtransactions themselves aren't necessarily good things, but here's why I think they work.\n\nBoth games are extremely cheap, with a low barrier to entry. Fortnite is free and RL is $20, yet they have as much, if not more, replay value and content compared to most AAA multiplayer games \\(like CoD and SWBF2\\). \n\nThey're fun in their own right, and are still enjoyable months after launch, even if you take breaks. Very easy to come back and play. \n\nBoth studios, Psyonix and Epic Games make clear efforts to ensure that their respective games are as fun and as good as they can be. Constantly adding new content and having fun, themed events/seasons to give people reasons to come back. \n\nI've found myself spending a ton of money on microtransactions in RL since I started playing it in the fall of 2016. It was a cheap initial purchase \\($10 with gamesharing on Xbox\\), and I've gotten a ton of fun out of it. And I appreciate that Psyonix works hard to make a fun game for such a low price, and offers up a ton of new content, pretty frequently. So I happily will spend $5 here, $10 there every so often. I want to support them as a studio, and if I'm spending my time still playing that game, instead of buying a new one, then it's money well spent.\n\nNot everybody sees it that way, especially on reddit, and that's okay.\n\nWith Fortnite, I haven't been playing long, only a couple of months. I've probably spent a total of $45 on the game. Bought the season 3 battle pass, and am going to buy Season 4's tomorrow. And then the other $25 I dropped yesterday to buy a pickaxe that I love the design of \\(the solar system one\\), which leaves me a ton of Vbucks to spare. Again, I'm comfortable spending that money on such \"frivolous things\" as a cosmetic that doesn't change how the game plays, because I've gotten enough playtime out of this game that it's worth a $60 AAA price tag \\(that I didn't even need to spend upfront\\). Not only that, but I'm aware of how much effort Epic puts into the game to make it better. Updates every week, often with new content in the form of both purchasable cosmetics and new in game items to spice up the game. \n\nContrast that to Call of Duty, where in four games over the past half decade have had loot boxes, I've spent a total of $20 on currency in them to buy drops. \n\nBack to the topic at hand, whales will not care. Most of the money in microtransactions comes from whales, people who have a ton of disposable income and spend a lot of it on the game. Those folks don't care about the morals of the game makers, nor do the care if they paid $60\\+ upfront or not. \n\nThe difference being, if a game is honest and well\\-made, with a good loot box system, the average person will be more likely to spend extra cheddar on loot boxes. I know tons of people who refuse to spend money on microtransactions in most games, who have bought keys in RL, or the battle pass in Fortnite. \n\nWith that, and the shitstorm that hit EA with SWBF2, I can see a world where loot boxes and MTX are done correctly, even in AAA games. \n\nDo you think I'm onto something here, or have I completely missed the mark?",

        "text": "I've played several games in which the protagonist is tasked with a fight or some challenge, only for the cutscene that follows to show my efforts being for nothing. \n\nScripted failure, in which the character fails at a task for story/plot purposes, is fine by itself. My own complaint with the system is that sometimes the preceding gameplay still expects you to successfully finish some asinine task to get to the cutscene. Meaning that, if you fail before you get to that point, you'll have to do it over, potentially multiples times if the difficulty is high. Sometimes it happens regardless of whether you succeed or not, but the game still expects some kind of player input. This is especially annoying if you've already played this sequence before or you suspect this is to come.\n\nThere's a more modern example I can use to illustrate. MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD FOR FAR CRY 5:\n\nIn each district controlled by one of the Seeds, you're basically kidnapped at every major milestone of resistance against that person. These events are unavoidable, and very predictable after the first couple times you experience them.\n\nDuring my first run-in with this, I was greeted with a capture party, which I attempted to fight off. They hit me with a tranquilizer (\"bliss bullets\" for those that know about it) to put me under and capture me in a scripted cutscene.\n\nDue to complications and a system change, I ended up playing this sequence again. This time I expected it to happen so I prepared and holed up in a sniper nest. I killed every enemy they sent my way, careful not to take any damage from gunfire. However, even after all the enemies were killed, I still initiated the cutscene by taking minor fall damage after the encounter!\n\nIt was as if my input didn't matter, despite another character telling me to \"watch out\" because I would be captured if I wasn't careful.\n\nI find certain instances like this infuriating. What are your thoughts? ",
