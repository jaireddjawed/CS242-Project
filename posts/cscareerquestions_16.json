So I'm a CS and Data Science double major, and I was primarily looking for SWE internships, but so far the only offer I've gotten is for a PM / Data Analyst role, which would basically involve doing data analysis from SQL databases, and some statistical analysis in Python, R, and Excel in order to influence PM decisions.\n\nObviously I'll accept it it's all I have, but I was just wondering if this experience is at all useful for future SWE roles, and would help my resume.

This is the first position Ive had where my boss just really grates on me to the point that I lose focus and it kills my productivity. He LOVES to lecture. FWIW I'm a senior developer of close to ten years, have worked on more complicated projects than this.\n\nA few examples:\n\n1. Told me on my first pull request that it was too big. No big deal, but then lectured me about *why* programmers make commits small. \n2. Later lectured me about why small commits can be a problem and why I should make my pull requests bigger if the work is related. **This was AFTER the lecture mentioned in the previous point, regarding the same exact commit(s).**\n3. Got a nitpick comment from a colleague that asked for a \"simple fix\" change to my commit. I said I felt the ask was outside of scope, and would also cause problems. Manager saw this exchange and verbally lectured me at my desk in front of others, *\"Whenever a teammate has a suggestion for an easy clean up that would make our code better, it's okay to include it\"* even though he had just previously given me a personal seminar against doing just that when I attempted to do so. As I anticipated, the \"minor change\" broke prod and I had to roll back.\n4. When I was newer and reached out to him for help on blockers, I'd have to first suffer a lecture that I should reach out sooner when blocked. Even though I am maybe only blocked for an hour or two, and that's why Im reaching out NOW.\n5. He will step in between two developers hashing out a disagreement on pull request, even if only 2-3 comments have been put out, to say things like, *\"We have bigger fish to fry. Move on.\"*\n6. When blocked by a sister team, instead of just asking nicely for a data review, he swooped in on a pull request to condescendingly comment to them, *\"Things can be simple for the people who have the right access to review this data. It can be a significant hurdle for the outsiders.\"* which totally burned my connection on that team because the woman on said team was just sick of his shit.\n7. I took the time to really dig into a relevant code to understand it before asking manager for help. I write up a summary to demonstrate I took the time to understand it, then presented it along with my question. I get a lecture, *\"Code changes with time. Sometimes the code archeology can be helpful\"*. The then literally regurgitates my findings and points me to git history as a way to discover this myself.\n\nHe just throws out a lot of condescending, patronizing remarks and I like my work and get paid too much that I just want to learn how to swallow it and not get so pissed off.",

I changed to a new job just under a year ago (launching a new product in the fintech space) and I've learned some new tricks in AWS which has been interesting and useful but it feels like all there is to do to gain a sense of \"progression\" is to learn yet another new technology which is the flavour of the month. This was fine for a while, but once you've learned enough programming languages, tools, methodologies it becomes rather unremarkable in my opinion.\n\nI like the idea of being able to add value beyond just churning out lines of code. Therefore, I have been considering roles as a technical lead which I've tried to pivot to (and have expressed this desire to my manager in no uncertain terms) but there are plans to hire much more experienced technical leads who have been made redundant from other companies in the current ubiquitous tech layoffs. Because of thinks I think this progression pathway is not looking too hopeful for me.\n\nI'm at a loss for what to do at the moment. I'm open to exploring other roles but am not too sure what they are. Are there any other roles I should consider? Or, any advice for moving into a technical lead role (I have considered this role because it seems like a natural step towards something familiar but different)? Or is there anything else you think I should do? \n\nThanks! \n\nTLDR; Being a senior software engineer is now kind of boring. Want to be a technical lead but not having much luck finding opportunities. Any advice? Alternate career paths?",

My colleagues, who I work with daily, said they all are impressed. I have carried and managed projects on my own within this team. Literally do stuff a junior shouldnt be doing on his own but I manage to deliver time and time again. Both quality and quantity. Had my colleagues give me feedback and all of them having nothing negative to say.\n\nHowever, my contract is expiring in ~2 months, and they told me they want to extend my contract, I told them I’d want to enter talks for new working conditions to better fit my role within the team. The manager said no and that its too soon to be discussing such things. So he wants to offer me the same conditions and doesnt even want to entertain the thought of asking me what I was thinking to receive as a raise.\n\nWhen I told him other companies and other departments within the same company are offering a better salary for the same tasks I am fulfilling as a junior, and their vacancies are being listed on medior level, he told me I should feel free to apply for those jobs.\n\nIs this normal? I feel like it isnt. How can you tell someone to go apply elsewhere if I want financial growth that reflects my performances and role within your team…? This rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nNow I am thinking of starting applying for jobs elsewhere, but not sure whether doing so just after a year is a good idea since my CV would give a job hopper vibe, ya know?\n\nCould you bros give me some advice?",

At first, I was assigned some small bugs and QOL features that I was  able to solve incredibly fast, but about a month ago I got assigned the  task of re-designing one of the UI pages on our web app and I. am.  losing. it. I'm about 90 commits deep into this thing, am making 0  progress, and every morning standup I just very sheepishly say that I'm  still working on it and then go back to banging my head against a wall.  Even worse, I have ADHD and at a certain point of making 0 progress, I  simply cannot even focus well enough on what I'm doing to do anything (I  haven't written a line of code in days)\n\nWhat  on earth do I do in this situation??? I don't want to bother the people  on my team who are doing useful things, but at this point I'm so  tangled up in my shit code I don't know what to do. I feel like this job  is way over my head and this morning I literally left my desk at the  end of my scheduled hours sobbing because I was so stressed over how  much of a shit job I'm doing. Has anyone else faced similar issues as a  junior developer or intern? Does anyone have any advice for avoiding situations like this where you're 100 commits deep into a PR with over 20 files edited and see no end in sight? Should I give up? or just start over?",

Also seniors have started to leave, and now they are moving the goal post to end of 2024, and I HIGHLY doubt that will happen too. What are the \"app migration\" actual chances this falls flat?

I haven't historically done any career work in computer science, it's just an interest of mine and I don't know how to code. If I have to do prep work before school that's fine and I'm expecting as much.   \nBut this is my problem: I can possibly get a year's worth of government funding to train up to a certificate in something while I stay on welfare (I'm in Canada). I can't do any more than that and I can't attend school while on welfare outside of doing this program, I'm expected to immediately get a job when I obtain the certificate. The govt. is looking for the most streamlined way to put people back to work.  I know people's entry points into computer science are varied and can range from years of schooling to self taught but I'm concerned that with no other background it will be very unlikely that I land anything decent with just a certificate. If you know of good quality, completely online CS Certificates in Canada please do let me know.  \n\n\nAlso, I'm very interested in Project Management as an end goal. Do you think I could gain enough knowledge with a certificate to go into a Project Management Certificate when I can and get hired to actually do that or do you need more experience in the field before you should consider project management?  \n\n\nI am trying my best to research, ask questions, watch videos, etc, but it's feeling very overwhelming. I browse through other people's career posts on here for insights too I'm a single parent and have my kids full time. But I need to do SOMETHING because not only am I expected to re-enter the workforce but I absolutely don't want to remain on welfare, it was just something I had to do after I left my ex and had to support my family.",

There's a guy  named A that does some simple coding tasks (e.g., changing names or adding paddings on the frontend), he also acts like a sort of product manager. He's a senior to me.\n\nThen there's this guy named B who is the CEO of the org and team lead of the backend in our team. To be fair, he's technically competent, however, he likes to be a reviewer of all the back-end PRs.\n\nB is also super busy. I sent him a design doc almost a month ago and he still hasn't gotten back to me. You have to kinda beg him to attend the backend PRs. That's the main reason our backend features move very slowly.\n\nThe product we're working on is almost ready for onboarding clients but the backend is moving very slowly and there are a few tasks remaining due to that. We also don't have anything else to do, so the last few months have been super chill for me and my teammates.\n\nI work on both front-end and back-end. Since there's not much to do, I look for bugs or technical debts and then ask for A's greenlight. From the very moment that I take something to do, A is always in my dm and like \"is it done?\", \"Did you create the PR?\", \"You said it would be done by last night but I can't see your PR\", \"John commented on your PR 2 hours ago, you haven't gotten back to him\" , \"ask B again to review your PR\", etc.\n\nSurprisingly, the one-liner frontend PR that I made one week ago was merged just today! It's like he's pressuring me for nothing. It's not like there are loads of things to do if I move quicker! The main site is fucking down for a month now and a guy from the marketing has asked both A and B to fix it but nothing has happened yet.\n\nI always try to code cleanly and provide well-thought solutions but his attitude is pushing me to write shitty code that will stop working in no time.\n\nI don't know what's the best way to deal with this guy. He's really getting on my nerves.",

I’ve done well in all my CS classes and internships but i think a large part of that is due to the fact that there has been so much hand-holding for any programming I have had to do. For all my programming assignments and internship work I’ve always had detailed instructions telling me exactly how to do things to the point where it feels like I’ve never really had to figure much out for myself. Because of this I feel like I might not just be a good programmer, simply good at following instructions. Some of this may be imposters syndrome but I feel like it is more than just that. Whenever people have technical discussions I often find myself getting lost on simple topics that I have definitely learned at some point but just can’t seem to remember or by the time i can parse what they meant they’ve moved on and I can no longer follow along. This makes me feel like I might have important gaps in my CS fundamentals. \n\nI was wondering if anyone has any advice for when you feel this way or any tips to do well in your first full-time job. I was also wondering if anyone had any useful resources to make you better software engineers early on or anything to help potentially fill in any gaps in the fundamentals I may have. I have a lot of free time this semester and i want to spend it learning how to be a better programmer and feel confident in building things for myself rather than needing a lot of guidance.\n\nAny advice or resources is really appreciated!",

Or should I do something niche that I'm a lot more interested in?\n\nFor something generic, I've seen tons of examples on the Internet: Pinterest clone, Facebook clone, online storefront, etc.\n\nFor something more niche, I was thinking of creating a [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/) clone. Mountain project is essentially an online guidebook for rock climbers. It has lists of different routes, organized by area, which site users can comment on, add photos of, add a \"tick\" to (meaning they've done that climb), etc. There are many other features, but that's the gist of it. Think of it sort of like AllTrails but for climbing. It's something I think would be a lot of fun for me to make a clone of, I'm just worried hiring managers might be turned off by its obscurity.\n\nAny other project advice (including languages, frameworks, and methodologies I should or shouldn't use) would also be greatly appreciated.",

I still get 60% of my salary, but I wanted to pad that difference nonetheless. \n\nWhile I got some rudimentary projects on Github, it's nothing I would show on a freelancing portfolio and it doesn't make much sense for me to create one within a few weeks, as I am basically on a timer and I could be more productive during that time.\n\nAre there any chances that I may find some work outside friends and family, and if yes, where should I look?\n\nBtw. I have been working professionally for 7 years now and would consider myself a generalist (3y C#, 3y nodejs+React, 1y Unreal Engine, as well as SQL+mongodb, some DevOps and infrastructure management)",

        "text": "Greetings all,\n\nI'm willing to put my dreams of being a software developer on temporary hold for the purposes of generating an income in the short-term. What kind of non-programming jobs should I be applying for as a fresh BSCS grad for the purposes of this effort? I know there must be some job titles of this sort that I'm not thinking of. I would be thrilled with anything that pays north of $50,000-$55,000 at the moment just to get an income stream going.\n\nI'm still rapid-firing software job applications and haven't given up completely, so please don't berate me on this. I'm feeling some pressure to get a backup plan going here. Any constructive ideas here are beyond welcome and highly appreciated. Thanks!",

I might need to take PTO for it and tbh I don't want to spend money just to potentially not earn anything from it.\n\nI want to ask if there's a company policy around compensating people for these types of interviews.\n\nWhat's the best way to proceed? Was anyone here bold enough to pop that question, and if yes, how?\n\nTIA!",
