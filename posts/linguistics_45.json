        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/8n1f4o/what_major_oversimplifications_are_common_in/",
        "text": "In [yesterday's discussion about the arbitrariness of the sign](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/8motf7/is_it_time_to_rule_out_the_sign_is_arbitrary/), one of the points commonly brought up was that introductory courses need to introduce oversimplified concepts and ideas that are necessary to keep things simple at the introductory level, but break down when you look at research-level linguistics. Inspired by this post, I decided to make this into a discussion topic.\n\nFor me, I can think of two major simplifications. The first is **free variation**. It's often taught in the phonology section of intro courses and textbooks alongside contrastive and complementary distribution, but it's long been known that no variation is really 'free', whether inside or outside of phonology: variation depends on factors like register, gender, age, social class, (for syntax) information structure, lexical semantics, processing, etc.\n\nThe other one is the concept of **word**, which is simply taken for granted with little further discussion. An exact, crosslinguistically valid notion of a word, however, is still yet to be found; even within languages, it is often difficult to find a consistent set of criteria that enable people to separate word boundaries clearly. It is increasingly clear that the concept of wordhood, if it should be retained at all, is a gradient notion rather than a categorical one. (Related to this is the way that intro linguistics classes frequently introduce categories like perfective aspect or copula constructions as widely applicable, without distinguishing between language-specific 'descriptive categories' and cross-linguistic 'comparative concepts' to use Haspelmath's terminology.)\n\nWhat other major simplifications can you think of? (They don't absolutely have to be from 101 classes; you can bring up common simplifications in intro syntax, intro phonetics, etc., as well.)",

The consequence is that it's hard to sustain the classes for a long time as students give up after a few weeks.\n\nI am not of African descent and I don't really have any close link with any of these languages but I feel the project is really cool and I'm also super eager to learn a totally different language.\n\nDoes anybody here have good advice to support the project?\nAny good quality teaching material for the languages listed above (if possible in French) ? Or advice / litterature on how to structure a language course from scratch?\n\n(I may have the possibility to join the NGO as a volunteer, and I think my experience learning various languages could be useful)\n\nthanks in advance for your help!",

My published works deal with argumentation and social and ideological formation in religious literature, especially religious legal literature. Over the years, I have discovered that social and/or anthropological linguistics is a much more valuable heuristic for my work than is rhetoric or rhetorical theory. Unfortunately, I have very little academic experience in linguistics other than the typical intro course and reading a few books by sociolinguists that have been relevant to my research.\n\nMy question is, could I start incorporating linguistics into my work and be taken seriously by linguists? Obviously this would take a lot of research on my part and would probably involve changing my familiar conference and publication venues, but is this possible or advisable? ",

While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate disscussion all of the time, here are some examples: \n\n*Quick questions:*\n\n* Asking for an explanation of a technical term\n* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature\n* Asking how we would transcribe something\n* Asking how a feature works in a particular language\n\n*Not-so-quick questions:*\n\n* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim\n* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject\n\nIf you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.\n\nAlso, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search.

        "text": "Most linguistics introductory textbooks, regardless of which theory it is based on, include the statement that the linguistic sign is an arbitrary connection between form and meaning in their introduction. That is, there is no inherent similarity between the name and what is named. I assume that most lingusitics 101 classes begin with a similar premise.\n\nBut a growing number of literature suggests that this is not entirely true. For example, [Urban's work](https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/flin.2011.45.issue-1/flin.2011.007/flin.2011.007.xml) has shown that words for \"lips\" tend to contain bilabial sounds, whereas words for \"nose\" tend to contain nasal sounds. This is not limited to vocal organ terms, but [also to a wide array of lexical items](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/39/10818.short).\n\nThus, isn't it problematic to bias the beginners towards a premise that is being constantly challenged and arguably falsified? Isn't it time to exclude the \"sign is arbitrary\" part of linguistics textbooks and introductory classes, or at least avoid theoretical bias by also introducing studies on the non-arbitrariness of the linguistic sign?\n\nEdit: By the \"sign is arbitrary\" principle I refer to the viewpoint that the form-meaning relationship is completely arbitrary, i.e. that there is nothing in the word \"nose\" that is related to the concept of nose. Of course, I do not support the opposite extreme viewpoint that a sign is not arbitrary at all.",

It's mostly focused on architecture but does leak into other facets of living. Last Thursday P decided to go into Latin a little bit. Whenever P starts a new section he gives us questions that in some way will be incorporated into the final.\n\nIssue 1: question 4 asks \"Latin is the precursor to which Romance languages?\" At which point I raise my hand and say, \"that question doesn't make sense. Romance languages are defined as being derived from Vulgar Latin so they *all* are,\" P disagrees with me and continues lecturing. \n\nIssue 2: P likes showing where things come from so he mentions Indo-European (IE). My first thought is, \"cool he'll mention their migration from Russia.\" Nope. P suggests that Sanskrit is the oldest of these languages and speakers of it travelled from India to Europe spreading the language and thus being the ancestor to all of these.\n\nIssue 3: P claims Etruscan is related to Latin. I thought Etruscan was the language of the original peoples of the region, prior to IE migration.\n\nIssue 4: I don't fully remember the context (at this point I'm just staring at my desk, not listening, debating whether or not I should just leave) but he claims some sort of connection with Aramaic and the IE family. Obviously Aramaic is part of the Afro-Asiatic family thus having no relation to IE. But he did include the Latin alphabet so maybe he implied they had similar classes? In full honesty, I'm not sure of the origins of the Aramaic writing system and it very well might be related to Phoenician. \n\nIssue 5: Mentions that Latin is inflected/agglutinative and says it's weird how English, related to German and having French/Latin influence, didn't include inflections like any of those languages (not saying French has inflections, definitely don't have the ability to say). I, for some reason still willing to participate, raise my hand and say, \"yeah it's more analytical\" to which he replies \"it's just... *different*\"\n\nI was so frustrated I wanted to tell him how wrong he was after class but the meter I was parked at was running out of time. And P had started the class mentioning that UCLA has whole courses (or something along those lines) dedicated to IE as if to back up all his claims so I'm unsure if he'll accept anything I say.",

        "text": "In a [recent paper](https://www.academia.edu/36705349/Can_cross-linguistic_regularities_be_explained_by_change_constraints), Martin Haspelmath argues (in section 6) against the view that functional-adaptive constraints need to specify pathways of change. As an example of the opposing view, he quotes Bybee: 'the validity of a principle as explanatory can only be maintained if it can be shown that the same principle that generalizes over the data also plays a role in the establishment of the conventions described by the generalization.'\n\nHaspelmath's response is as follows: 'Bybee does not seem to envisage the possibility of a \"pull force\" that increases the probability of change toward a particular kind of outcome, without determining the way in which the change comes about. Moreover ... The primary evidence for functional-adaptive explanations is the fit between the causal factor and the observed outcome. If there is a good fit, ... the best explanation is in functional-adaptive terms, as long as there is a way for languages to acquire these properties.'\n\nI think both positions have their merits, and personally I agree with Haspelmath's second point, but have reservations about the first one.\n\nI think that *correlations* between functional-adaptive constraints, which Haspelmath is an advocate of, can definitely serve as evidence that functional-adaptive constraints shape the diachronic development of language. For example, to use Zipf's classic example, it's hard to explain why less frequent words crosslinguistically tend to be shorter in any other way. Given how little we currently know about the exact mechanisms that bring about language change, correlations from observational studies, given that we statistically control for covariates like language family and areal influence, may be the best kind of evidence we can have at the moment.\n\nHowever, I'm less convinced about 'a \"pull force\" that increases the probability of change toward a particular kind of outcome, without determining the way in which the change comes about'. A probability model is just a mathematical model; probabilities don't 'exist out there' (not at the level of linguistics anyway; linguistics is way too high-level for quantum mechanics to be relevant) but should be grounded in some mechanism in reality. It may not be possible at the moment for us to find the exact neural mechanisms whereby functional constraints cause people to produce a particular innovation, or the exact mechanisms by which functional adaptions favour the spread of linguistic features throughout a speech community, but it's still worth keeping these goals in mind, and if we find these mechanisms, it would add much more support to functional-adaptive constraints than correlations alone.\n\nWhat do you think?",

About 30 pages in I stumbled upon the statement that Eskimo's have 50 words for snow; a claim that even with my extremely limited knowledge of the subject, I recognised as a misnomer.\n\nThis prompted me to check out some reviews of the book on Goodreads and Amazon. There are plenty of rave reviews, but there are also a significant number accusing the book of being wildly innacurarte.\n\nHow innacurarte is Mother Tongue really? Are the people crisicising it nit picking or is it basically just a book of made up nonsense? I was really enjoying the book but I'm reluctant to continue now. If it just has a few insignificant errors here and there I'll keep going but I don't want to fill my head with 'knowledge' that isn't true.\n\nIf Mother Tongue really is garbage, can anyone recommend an alternative? I'm an avid reader but sometimes struggle with dry non-fiction so I find Bryson's writing style really refreshing and easy to read.

Other phonemes I've seen labeled as such are the Dental Fricatives and many Palatal phonemes, especially the Affricates. None of them seem to be particularly complicated to pronounce (except for proper palatal Stops in my case), so what makes them unstable and likely to evolve into another?  \n  \nAlso, I've seen some phonemic inventories be described as unstable, like the [Danish Vowel inventory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_phonology#Vowels). It does look like a complicated system, so how does an inventory with so many -reportedly- unstable phones arise in the first place?  \n  \nDo you have any more examples of unstable phonemes and phonemic inventories?

        "text": "I've found that often, sound changes and allophony are conditioned by environments that seem to have little to do with the actual change. I started thinking about this due to some things I found in Bantu languages.\n\nMany Bantu languages had a historical process where prenasalized voiceless stops were aspirated. Some languages dropped the prenasalization, resulting in contrastive aspiration in languages such Sotho and Swahili. Other languages dropped the stop but left the aspiration, resulting in aspirated nasals (Kinyarwanda), voiceless nasals (Sukuma), or breathy voiced nasals (Shona).\n\nNguni languages never underwent this post-nasal aspiration process, but aspirated voiceless stops in general. However, Zulu and Xhosa due not aspirate prenasalized voiceless stops. In fact, there is a synchronic process where the aspirated voiceless stops are deaspirated when prenasalized.\n\nSo I see a contradiction. In the same environment, some languages aspirate voiceless stops, whereas others deaspirate them. It seems like the conditioning environment has no phonetic correlation with the change, given that it can go either way.\n\nSome American English dialects have a process of /æ/ tensing, where /æ/ is diphthongized before a nasal. However, I don't see any connection between the prenasal environment and diphthongization.\n\nIn these examples, the changes themselves are not strange. What is odd is that the conditioning environment has no apparent connection with the change.\n\nIs there some phonetic motivation for the changes above that I'm missing? Or maybe it has more to do with language internal processes? Why would normal sound changes end up occurring in environments that are seemingly irrelevant?",

Are ergative speakers similarly bamboozled by why accusative speakers would think of the S and A arguments as different?
