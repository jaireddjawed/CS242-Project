It also characterizes the president's behavior as erratic, describes discussions between White House officials of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the president based on his erratic behavior, and how the president's national security team took actions to punish Russia for the poisoning of a former spy in Britain when the president was reluctant to do so. \n\nIs this simply a ploy to rehabilitate the image of a post-Trump Republican party (or perhaps even a current non-Trump-Aligned wing of the Republican party)? Do these revelations signal or have greater effects on how Republicans will perform in the midterms? Does this essay make it easier for Trump-reluctant Republicans to oppose Trump's policy objectives?\n\nThe original essay can be read [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html).",

        "author": "ethanjdennett",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/9daog4/could_a_global_cannabis_industry_without_us/",
        "text": "As more and more [countries legalize cannabis](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/23/cannabis-legalization-global-wave-britain-marijuana), the US continues to push back. Yes, there are movements in California, Colorado, Washington, etc, however it seems the population is generally conflicted on the prospect. Mexico recently announced its intentions to [add cannabis to NAFTA](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-30/pot-should-be-added-to-nafta-former-mexico-president-fox-says), and as a Canadian I support this proposal. Nonetheless, let's assume that cannabis is added to NAFTA; thus hopefully eliminating Cannabis as a revenue stream from Mexican and Canadian gangs. While the free-trade of cannabis should also help to create a significant foundation for the global cannabis export and import industry, while also boosting both Canadian and Mexican economies. Will the success of this proposal be enough to encourage countries in the global south to join in (so to speak), or will the US do its best to politically block further expansion of the industry? What measures could the US use to block the expansion of a cannabis industry? \n\nCurrently the US already (officially) opposes the legalization of cannabis in *separate sovereign states* (I won't expand on that for now); thus showing it is willing and able to politically oppose the cannabis industry expanding. It seems clear to me that the US opposes the cannabis industry expanding both, because of the clear propaganda model it uses to indoctrinate and *incarcerate* its population regarding cannabis, and because an industry like cannabis could help to undermine the chock-hold the US possesses over the global economy.  The US, if it desires to continue its indoctrination and incarceration regarding cannabis, cannot properly legalize it. If the US was the legalize cannabis, the state would lose the majority of its (nearly slave) prison labour in due time. Legalization would also pave the way for greater African-American income, education, and political participation. Thus, I see the US as committed to keeping cannabis illegal without due social change and activism. \n\n Therefore, the US currently does not possess the tools to properly legalize and participate in the global cannabis industry. However, this puts the US between and rock and a hard place (so to speak) - if the global cannabis substantially grows it could lift some of the need in the Global south for US support. If Columbia could sell cannabis globally, without any US participation (i.e. market presence), shouldn't it face less sanctions and help its dire economic position? Wouldn't countries like Canada and Mexico be willing to conduct cannabis trade with Columbia? Or would their support/reliance on the US be too much of a deterrence? Legalization and global trade of cannabis could undermine some of the sanctions/economic-strangle the US is imposing on the Columbia, correct? Further, a full legalization of cannabis could spur real economic growth in the global south, and the first substantial growth without US social/economic restrictions; giving economic and political power back to the domestic population.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy main question is: if the US does not participate in an expanding cannabis industry, will their lack of presence serve to undermine some of their economic power globally? Or will the US have another stream of power I am not considering to retain its global position? ",

They just hold a lot of extremist views across the political spectrum.\n\nOn an issue by issue basis, non-centrist positions are far more popular than centrist positions on most issues. For example, on Marijuana policy, by far the most popular position was full legalisation. On immigration, the most popular position is roundup and deportation of all undocumented.\n\nThe myth that by bringing in less politically engaged voters into the system will moderate the current partisan divide is largely not borne out by facts. The data suggests the opposite, that bringing in formerly unengaged voters will in fact polarise the climate even more since they tend to hold more extremist views on a variety of issues, but they do so across ideological boundaries.\n\nThis is borne out by the phenomenon of both Trump and Sanders in the 2016 presidential election cycle, where they both engaged previously unengaged voters and brought policy positions previously out of the “mainstream” into the public consciousness.",

        "text": "I've been thinking about the consequences of this administration, especially about those consequences which may transpire in the years after its been laid to rest. The legacy that it seems to be leaving is already one of disorder, mistrust, and nationalism. While looking at the amendments following the Bill of Rights, it appeared to me that the most common warrant for an amendment to be ratified was that a congressional referendum on human rights violations in the country arises. Especially those that follow:\n\n&gt;• 13th Amendment — Abolishes slavery, and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime. \n\n&gt;• 14th Amendment — Defines citizenship, contains the Privileges or Immunities Clause, the Due Process Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, and deals with post–Civil War issues. \n\n&gt;• 15th Amendment — Prohibits the denial of the right to vote based on race, color or previous condition of servitude. \n\n&gt;• 19th Amendment — Prohibits the denial of the right to vote based on sex. \n\n&gt;• 24th Amendment — Prohibits the revocation of voting rights due to the non-payment of a poll tax or any other tax. \n\nIt felt better to leave out the 23rd Amendment (since I'm unsure of whether or not it was a human rights issue). It felt more like an issue of fair representation, but it was very localized, and didn't seem to be a result of prejudice. And the 18th Amendment is just horrible, but I don't consider the act of drinking alcohol to be a human right, so I didn't consider the 21st Amendment to be a restoration of human rights. You're more than welcome to challenge and sway me on that opinion. Back onto the subject at hand!\n\nThe border incident (where families have been separated, and children have been expected to represent themselves as adults in court) stands out to me as something the 114th Congress might want to reflect on. I'm aware that some of this occurred during the Obama presidency, but the media recently pulled this issue open wide. People know about it and have complained to their local representatives and senators. It's left a sour taste in a lot of the American peoples' mouth. That being said, it doesn't feel like an amendment sized issue. Paired with the mistreatment of refugees and immigrants from \"black-listed\" countries, most of the administration's human rights violations have been something more suitable for international legislation. So I don't see anything of this genre resulting in an amendment.\n\nAnother common warrant for amendments is the congress' disapproval of how the Office of the Presidency functions (either for ways in which its intended rules were violated, or in ways in which the country has changed its mind on how the office should be exercised). I'll provide a list of amendments that fit this description:\n\n&gt;• 12th Amendment — Revises presidential election procedures by having the President and Vice President elected together as opposed to the Vice President being the runner up.\n\n&gt;• 20th Amendment — Changes the date on which the terms of the President and Vice President (January 20) and Senators and Representatives (January 3) end and begin. \n\n&gt;• 22nd Amendment — Limits the number of times that a person can be elected president: a person cannot be elected president more than twice, and a person who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected cannot be elected more than once. \n\n&gt;• 25th Amendment — Addresses succession to the Presidency and establishes procedures both for filling a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, as well as responding to Presidential disabilities.\n\nSo that's exactly (amusingly) 25% of all amendments since the Bill of Rights. A quarter. Gripes about the president. Which is in contrast to 31% of post-conception amendments being over issues of human rights. And a hilarious 11% being over whether or not it's legal to get shitfaced on hops. The administration has been caught up in all manner of felonies, bribes, and misbehavior. It's also set up some awful precedents that have a potential to pave way for similar unsavory activities if there's no congressional reaction later down the road. Does anybody think that there could be an amendment laid down after Trump leaves office? A few that come to mind:\n\n&gt;• Limiting the length in which a Supreme Court Justice serves, in order to prevent the president from setting up a partisan branch of government that exercises partisan bias over the following decades.\n\n&gt;• Disallow the president from being able to pardon himself of federal crimes he has committed.\n\n&gt;• Retiring of the Electoral College and establishment for a direct democratic election of the president (with preferential voting).\n\n&gt;• Limiting the amount of executive orders a president can sign during a year.\n\nI'm not necessarily suggesting those, they just come to mind.\n",

Far more interesting than the subscriber count (we think) is actual participation. Uniques, and traffic in general, fell significantly after the 2016 election, but never normalized down to where they had been prior to that election entering full swing in late 2015. Over this past summer we saw a healthy increase in participation that reached its apex in July, which kept with general usage trends that track the academic year. Overall we're pleased with engagement, displeased but unsurprised regarding the rise of incivility, trolling, and bad-faith investment, and excited to keep things high quality for as long as we've got folks interested in discussion.\n\nFeel free to use this thread for discussion of any topic you like, e.g. how there are two more trillion dollar companies now than there were at 200k subs, that new Spider-Man game, or why [Jim Gilmore](http://gilmoreforpresident.com/) should mount a primary challenge in 2020.",

All top-level comments should be for individual polls released within the last week *only*. \n\nUnlike submissions, top-level comments do not need to ask a question. **However, they must summarize the poll in a meaningful way**; link-only comments will be removed. Discussion of those polls should take place in response to the top-level comment. \n\nTypically, polls posted in this thread must be from a [538-recognized pollster](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/). If you see a dubious poll posted, please let the team know via report. Feedback is welcome via [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalDiscussion). \n\nWe encourage sorting this thread by 'new'. The 'suggested sort' feature has been [broken](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8ok7sz/posts_opened_in_a_new_tab_still_do_not_sort/) by the redesign and automatically defaults to 'best'.
