I'd love any book recommendations to learn more on the matter in general.",

One would usually consider speech \"correct\" for following the rules of the language.\nOn the other, inversions are allowed as figures of speech, and language has been known to transform, as incorrect, i formal uses become accepted and thus correct\nIn the case of our example though, one could also argue that a single user is not enough to justify a \"cultural shift of language\"\n\nIn a broader, more philosophical sense, can one define a sentence or speech as strictly, absolutely \"correct\" ? Or is it a malleable matter, subject to the ebbs and flow of societal use only ?\n\n(Original debate was about french, but it is easier to find a  linguistics community in english. Also the inversions in Yoda's speech are similar in both languages. If one has information only pertaining to french, it is also accepted)\n\nThank you.",

        "text": "So, I've read some stuff by John Rickford and listened to a few podcast about AAE's and I'm wondering what people's thoughts are on its origins. It's a super fascinating topic to me\n\nRickford outlined three perspectives: \n\n- The Afrocentric approach says that AAE is \"genetically\" a language of the Niger-Congo region, where English was adapted around these languages' structures, but with the lexicon being almost entirely supplied by English. I think one of the podcasts I listened to said compared it to Standard English being \"genetically\" Germanic, even though most of its words aren't Germanic in origin. I listened to a lot of stuff about the Oakland Ebonics controversy and this seemed to be a popular theory among those advocating for AAE to be used in schools as a tool to help students master Mainstream English, although not necessarily the orthodox opinion \n\n- The second approach was Eurocentric and it claims that enslaved Africans learned English from settlers and indentured servants from Britain and Ireland who would've spoken dialectal forms of English or even English as a second language in the case of lots of Irish and some Scots. Just anecdotally I heard that some Irish dialects use the \"Habitual be\" so asked an Irish friend of mine and he said that people say things like \"he do be early\" meaning \"he is often or usually early\". This seems to be the view of most linguists as far as I can tell? Although Rickdord did point out that it painted a somewhat more cosy relationship between colonists and enslaved people than history tells us\n\nThe third one that I heard less about was the Creole theory, although Rickford says it's the one he likes the best. I think it's basically that AAE started off as a Creole similar to those found in the Carribran and became closer to standard English\n\nThe book was written in like 1999 and podcasts all usually have their own bias so I thought I'd ask on here and hopefully generate a discussion!",

        "text": "We know that Gostak is a singular noun, Distimming is a verb, and Doshes are a plural noun. But what do they mean?\n\nGostak may be a borrowing from slavic languages (or rather a weird alternate version of slavic languages from a world where Gostak is a real word), meaning either \"the one who is Gosting, a Goster\" like \"p≈Çywak\" (swimmer) is \"the one who swims\", or it could also mean \"a young Gosta\" like \"kurczak\" (chicken) from \"kura\" (hen) or \"≈õwiniak\" (little pig) from \"≈õwinia\" (pig). The latter implies that the Gostak is some type of animal, like chickens and pigs.\n\nDistimming may be the opposite of Timming, created with the same \"dis\" prefix seen in the word \"disassemble\". Distimming might mean something like destroying or breaking. \n\nDoshes may be the name of an object. We can only assume that said object would be somewhat like dishes, as the names are kinda similar.\n\nSo, the sentence \"The Gostak Distims the Doshes\" might mean \"the young animal breaks the dishes\".",

It's a gender-neutral dictionary that offers alternative terms for common, gendered words. The idea is to provide a space for people to find and suggest more inclusive language choices.\n\nRight now it's just a simple site to explore the idea. I'm hoping to get some early feedback from kind internet strangers so I can make any necessary improvements and decide if it's worth investing time to make it a real and fully functional website. Here are a few questions I have:\n\n1. **First impressions**: Do you ever find yourself looking for gender neutral alternatives to words? Like \"Fisherman\" or \"Waitress\"? Would you find a site like this useful to find and share ideas?\n2. **Suggestions for improvement**: is there anything you think I should add or change to make the website more user-friendly?\n3. **Additional features**: are there any features you think would be helpful to have on the site?\n4. **Watch out fo**r: are there any potential sensitivities or problems that you can spot for a site like this? I want it to be helpful, but I'm cautious that I'm not an expert, so I'm trying to be mindful of ways this could be misused or be harmful to readers.\n\nI'm grateful for the support and advice of this community, and I can't wait to hear your thoughts!",

We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.\n\nThis is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.\n\n**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**\n\n* Beginner questions ‚Äî if you‚Äôre looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we‚Äôll ask you to move it here.\n\n* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search ‚Äî you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it‚Äôs sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.\n\n* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature ‚Äî unless it‚Äôs a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it‚Äôs a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.\n\n* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature ‚Äî remember to link to audio examples.\n\n* English dialect identification requests ‚Äî for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.\n\n* Questions about prescriptivism ‚Äî such as whether it's good or bad, when it's appropriate, whether something \"counts\" as prescriptivism, etc. These questions usually need the same general answers clarifying the role of descriptivism/prescriptivism in linguistics, so please post them here.\n\nWe‚Äôll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You‚Äôre free to post your question here.\n\nIf you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don‚Äôt get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it‚Äôs already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.\n\n**Discouraged Questions**\n\nThese types of questions are subject to removal:\n\n* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you‚Äôre not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.\n\n* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you‚Äôve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won‚Äôt come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.\n\n* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice ‚Äî basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.\n\n* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list ‚Äî follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",

Introduction to Linguistics would be aimed at language and linguistics enthusiasts who feel like they want to have a more structured overview of linguistics but don't want to enroll in a university programme to get it. Introduction to Corpus linguistics would give course takers the tools to research the English language more independently. Corpus Linguistics is &lt;3.\n\nNow my problem is: Most of my current students are Chinese, and they are at a level where they are more interested in improving their English than learning about linguistics. Do you think there are language enthusiasts out there who would be interested in such courses and where could I find them? :D",

This debuccalization is very frequent in certain function words. For example demonstratives Œ∏a, Œ∏u are always ha, hu except in the speech of a 85 year old woman. \n\nAnother example is the construction with 2nd singular + pronoun /to/, which due to sandhi, mutates to /Œ∏o/, and was becoming /ho/. Thus, vu Œ∏o, vi Œ∏o and  Éao Œ∏o (French veux-tu, vois-tu, sais-tu) often become vu ho, vi ho,  Éao ho. The oldest person presenting this change was 73, but the youngest person surveyed, who was 6, also maintained /Œ∏/. This change was the most frequent amongst young girls.\n\nHowever for common nouns and verbs /Œ∏/ never debuccalizes hence /ÀàtiŒ∏a/ and /koÀàŒ∏…í/ are never /Ààtiha/ and /koÀàh…í/, except before r where /Œ∏r/ tends to become /hr/ (or perhaps /rÃ•/). But even this change was only found in the youngest generation, a 23 year old was the oldest person surveyed with this change.\n\nMy question is, is it frequent for function words to be at the \"forefront\" of phonetic change and split away?",

I have noticed that several words start with the prefix \"re-\" and indeed in many cases, e.g., \"rewrite\", it seems that \"re-\" is clearly a derivational morpheme signifying the meaning of the action of \"write\" again.\n\nIn other cases, with words such as \"reply\", to me, it seems that it is monomorphemic since although it does seem to have the prefix \"re-\", the remainder \"-ply\" on its own does not seem be meaningful and I have read the same elsewhere in this sub. Please correct me if my understanding of this is wrong.\n\nHOWEVER, in even more cases, with words such as \"relate\" and \"release\" it seems less clear. If \"re-\" were to be considered as a morpheme, the remainder of the word would be \"late\" and \"lease\" respectively. But \"late\" and \"lease\" seem very much to have nothing to do with the meaning of \"relate\" and \"release\". Could these words \"relate\" and \"release\" have been adopted as a single morpheme into English from Latin?\n\nI would greatly appreciate it if others could help explain and weigh in on what they think about whether the appearance of \"re-\" in a word must always render it a morpheme.

Now, I'm aware native speakers aren't necessarily trained linguists, but one of them seemed to be claiming that, in one of the two \"chequeamos\"s, there was an additional stress/emphasis on the \"a\" in \"-amos\".\n\nAs a Spanish learner, I had never heard such a thing before in any of my studies; I was always taught that the difference was contextual.  So, my question(s) to you all:\n\n* Is there any evidence of this phenomenon existing in Spanish?  Is it perhaps dialectal?\n* Does this reflect a sort of artificial \"disambiguating\" usage to clarify potential confusion between past/present, the same way I've heard Spanish speakers artificially contrast &lt;b&gt; and &lt;v&gt; as /b/ and /v/ (despite there being otherwise no productive phonemic distinction between the two)?\n* Do you know of any other examples of this in Spanish or any other languages, where typically identical verb forms may be artificially distinguished in speech?",
