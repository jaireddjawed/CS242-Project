One thing that really sticks out to me is this one scent I randomly smell when I’m trying to fall asleep. It has only happened about 2 times a month but it’s really wired. I smell a cigar/floral smell. Neither would make since because no one in my house smokes and I live in the middle of nowhere so it’s not neighbors. You may thing I have a floral air freshener or something but I am very sensitive to scents so I can’t have anything floral scented or just any strong scents in general. I smelled a scent similar at the McRaven tour home in Vicksburg that the tour guide we may smell. She said either floral or smoke but I smelled both and some people smelled nothing. Anyone know why this is happening?",

Finally i got to my house and shut the door. i have never gone back to that area, even if it meant taking the bus, i did not care. i can still hear it rustling in the trees. i didnt want to tell anyone in fear of being seen as crazy or lying, but i know for a fact that what i saw that day was no human. the moment i turned 18 i moved, and i have no intention of going back.",

Sur notre planète, des fissures non visible à l'oeil nu apparaissent de manière temporaires, faisant tomber les personnes qui tombent dans la fissure pour les emmener dans le stuckworld. \n\nCes fissures disparaissent avec le temps, et l'agence Meylce tentent de les repérer pour pouvoir accéder à ce monde, et l'explorer. L'existence de celui-ci avait été découverte via plusieurs reportages, au début, cela n'était qu'une théorie mais l'agence avait en mains certains enregistrements à présent gardés privés qui leur prouvaient que quelque-chose de vraiment hors du commun existait.\n\nLe stuckworld qui serait bloqué entre deux réalités , dont la notre, souffrirait du fait que il ne puisse pas respirer, étant donné que celui-ci est coincé, et cela endommagerait les coins de cet endroit qui serait donc fissuré.\n\nEn 2001, l'agence Meylce travaille sur une machine, ayant pour le but d'ouvrir une faille pour aller explorer cet endroit. Ils y arriveront en 2009, un homme est donc envoyé seul, celui-ci se serait porté volontaire. On lui donne du matériel, et on lui demande de tout filmer, de prendre des notes. L'individu garde contact avec la base grâce à la radio, mais il ne reviendra jamais.\n\nLes visiteurs... Ces gens qui ont pour travail d'en apprendre plus sur le stuckworld, qui semblerait enfermer les individus y entrant.\nCertains ont essayés de fermer la faille en voyant que aucuns d'entre eux ne revenaient, ils voulaient tenter à la place de fermer toutes les fissures mais une fois ouvertes, impossible de revenir en arrière...\n\n\nVous êtes un visiteur ? Vous avez peut-être une chance de vous en sortir vivant.\n\nVous n'êtes pas un visiteur ? Dans ce cas, bonne chance.\n\nEn tout cas... il y a des chances pour que vous revoyez écrit ce mot quelque part, Meylce.",

My mom asked me what was wrong, I told her what I had just seen, but she insisted there was absolutely no man walking his dog. \nThis happened almost 20 years ago now, and I can still see the surprise in the man's face.

        "text": "First of all, I apologize if there are things badly written or if I don't give much detail about the story, English is not my first language so I have some difficulty expressing myself with it.\n\nThis happened when I was little, I remember that I was with my sister and my cousin and it occurred to us to go play into a shed-like room that's in the terrace. Everything was fine, we were talking and having fun until suddenly the door closed completely, we found it strange since it is a pretty thick and heavy wooden door, but we didn't feel scared because there was a bit of a strong wind outside and we thought it probably closed because of that. When we wanted to open it again, we couldn't, and it wasn't because we were kids and \"we didn't have the strength\" since between two we could open it, and at that moment we were three so it should've been even easier, but it wasn't. It felt like someone was pushing the door on the other side to keep us in there and at that moment we panicked and started screaming, calling for our grandfather in hopes that he would come help us, we kept screaming until at one point we realized that some shadows could be seen through the hole under the door, we thought they were someone's feet until we realized that they moved a lot. They were small shadows with a shape similar to a salt shaker, which we found strange for obvious reasons and we just stayed looking at them in silence until our grandfather arrived and opened the door for us. I don't know if my cousin remembers it because I don't have much contact with her anymore, but sometimes I talk about it with my sister and she remembers it the same way I do, and we always wonder what that could've been. So... Does anyone have an idea why we saw several salt shaker shaped shadows? I know it sounds ridiculous but it really happened. 😭 I saw many ghosts/shadow people since I was little but this was nothing like it, and I don't think they were elves because they didn't look like it, plus they were smaller.",

        "text": "Growing up, I(29F) lived in a haunted house. My sisters and mother all have an affinity for the paranormal but I am too scared to allow myself to see it. Every time something unexplainable happened I would run away, ignore it, pretend it never happened and distracted myself. Examples would be hearing my parents call my name when I know I am home alone, hearing clicking noises that are coming from the middle of an empty room, clearly seeing someone standing in a corner as I pass by, doing a double take for them to no longer be there. \n\nOne night when I was about 19 I was staying up late, watching cartoons and drawing. It was about 2 in the morning when my dog picked up her head and started looking towards the middle of my room. She jolted back as if something freaked her out, and then immediately got off of my bed and ran to the middle of the room, barking hysterically at something I could not see. This immediately gave me goose bumps and I called my dog back multiple times, trying to get her back to my bed and make her calm down- she would not stop. Then it happened, I felt something… it was like someone squeezed my legs. I had both of my legs out in front me (sitting up) and they were under blankets. I felt it but I thought I was imaging it. Then I looked down to see, clear as day, 2 large hand shaped imprints over the blankets, slowly running from below my knees up to my thighs. My lights were on. I was sober. I was fully awake.  There was no denying that it happened. I couldn’t move, I didn’t know what to do. I started crying and called my younger sister (sleeping in another room next to me) over and over until she woke up and came to my room. My dog didn’t stop barking until my sister came to my room. I had a full blown panic attack. I know this story is not as scary from an outside perspective but I have never been so scared. \n\nAnother strange factor was around this time we had a peeping Tom that was leaving lots of evidence of them looking through our windows, trying to open windows and getting into our cars. He would leave handprints and forehead prints on our windows, and I think I may have woken up while he was watching  because he left a step ladder (he grabbed it from my side yard) against my window on multiple occasions. Another time we found bare footprints outside our window in mud after a rainy night. We never figured out who it was but all my sisters and I have since moved out and my parents haven’t noticed anything else weird happening. They didn’t notice it before either, I was the only one finding/pointing out the occurrences. I know these are two different situations but I sometimes I feel like they are related somehow. \n\nI moved out a couple years later with no re-occurrence of that night. It was one of the scariest experiences I have ever had and when I talk about this story out loud I still tear up and get emotional. I do still experience things depending on where I live. Luckily the house I now own does not have any weird vibes or things happening after a couple years living here. I just thought I would share one of my scariest paranormal experiences.

        "text": "When I was around 7 years old, I used to live in this big two story house with my parents and my baby brother. At the time, my brother was just learning to crawl around on his own so it wouldn’t be super out of the ordinary for him to crawl up the stairs (under supervision of course) by himself periodically. For context, my bedroom door was facing the entrance of the stairs; I couldn’t see down them but I could see the space in the hallway where one would come down/up, and my door was always left open during the night because I was scared of the dark.\n\nOne night I woke up suddenly, which was strange for me because I was and still am a notoriously deep sleeper. I remember hearing what sounded like the fridge opening downstairs, thought it must be my dad or something, and closed my eyes again. \n\nAgain I was woken by the sound of what seemed to be very slow and heavy footsteps coming up the stairs, and again, half asleep and too lazy to pay any attention to it, I decided it must’ve been my brother crawling up the stairs and I closed my eyes again.\n\nWhen I opened them again, there was a boy standing directly in my doorway, I will never forget what he looked like. He looked like he was probably 12 years old or something, bright copper hair, very pale skin, freckles, blue eyes, wearing striped blue pajamas. But what startled me the most were two things. \n\nOne, the boy was glowing. I mean literally glowing. He had this blue aura around his entire body. But most striking of all was that he was holding a glass of milk in his hand… I wondered if he had gotten it from the fridge and if that could explain the sound I heard earlier… \n\nI did not feel any malicious energy though, we both just started at each other, no smiling or creepy looks. It looked as if he was getting ready for bed and I was in his spot or something. I remember hiding my head under the covers, and when I emerged, he was gone.\n\nTo this day I’ve only ever seen something like this only once more, but the most recent experience was definitely not as friendly.\n\nRegardless I will never forget that boy standing in my doorway, and I wish I knew more about him.",

I told myself that he could just be really busy because Christmas is literally this weekend, and he has a big family.\n I never asked my uncle that bluntly about that kind of stuff because to me it's improper. \nThe only reason why I did it that time was because my mom asked me to.

        "text": "Okay so, when I was 9-10 my whole family and I rented a mansion for a week in San Antonio. I don't remember what it was for exactly I just remember a big staircase that was spiral kind of anyways there was a locked door under them my cousins and I started to talk about what could be under them bodies of past renters, Creepy dolls like Annabelle, Killer clowns (They were still relevant). The mansion had a big pool in the back so we played there for a while. For some reason the back yard was connected to the open woods like no fences or anything. I remember I saw a tall black figure I told my mother and she seemed freaked out or something.  She had asked my father and my uncles to check it out they found nothing. It was getting late so my tia showed us where we would be sleeping upstairs it was an empty room with 3 bunk beds but the thing is there were no lights so they had given us glow sticks. When everyone was asleep I saw 2 tall black figures in the corner I got freaked out and covered myself with a blanket. When I fell asleep I woke up in a dream but I thought I had actually woken up. I looked out the window and saw little children coming from the woods I tried screaming but I couldn't.   \nFor some reason I could move my body but can't see. Then I had another dream that there were dead bodies in the locked room under the stairs and a little girl saying \"Come play with me Adrian for ever\" I told my mother and we left the next day. I just wanna know did I see shadow people?",

Back story about that house is that a couple used to live there and they both got suicide because of loan matters in bank. I was studying in school at that time and both my parents have jobs, so I would be home alone if my school or i am on leave. My home have particular type of chairs which is heavy and would make scratching sounds if dragged. I had no pets at that time and windows would be closed at all times and there was no incidents that animals got in. \n\nOne time , I was gardening outside and I heard this particular sound of chair in my home dragging. I know its from my house because the sound would irritate me when my parents does it. Then I was curious to know about it and went to look it. One chair was misplaced from the rest. I look every room for anyone or any animals that would have come inside but I couldn't find anything for the cause of what happened. \n\nSecond time, I was studying in my room. Door of my room was closed but I can see the light from the hall from under the door. As usually no one was presently there in the home except me. Hall's light is so bright that I can know if anyone was in front of my door. I don't know what I saw or can't described it. I saw two small shadows under the door like someone was in front of my door \\[ as the size of it, it would be legs\\] . Even when I got to open the door, the two shadows was there. I opened the door and nothing was there. I thought it would be some insects and I look whole room and the hall and there was not that big insects.\n\nThis kind of things happened so many times but these two scared me. Please let me know if you encountered such things.",

        "text": "This might sound ridiculous compared to some other posts here but if it's Christmas time anyway I decided to share this bizzare experience of mine with you all. It is 100% real and I made this account specially for this post so that you don't accuse me of farming karma.\n\nI don't remember exactly how old I was at that time but I was still in kindergarten. When my dad picked me up, we often used to stop by in a park on the way home. For a little context: My dad was (and is) a great man and when I was little (around that same time) he used to make maps for treasures for me to find and he would actually hide some real treasures around the park so that I could find them.\n\nSo back to the story, we were in the park as usual, and while we were walking there was a sewer hole from which were coming waves of steam, as it if was a furnace. We were heading towards it and I remember my dad saying: \"Look, maybe here is where Santa prepares the gifts for the good children\". I laughed a little because around that time I already knew Santa wasn't real. Then, as we passed by the hole I looked through the holes of the covering and I saw a man wearing a weird triangle shaped head. \n\nEverything happened very fast and I could only barely see through the holes and all the steam but the man was sitting on a table and it looked as he was writing something. When I saw him I remember freezing for a little moment and there were many things going on through my little head. I thought either that was a real elf and my dad was telling the truth or maybe it was a man hired by him for me to see, just like he hid all the treasures. Anyway, I didn't tell him anything and he didn't say anything either.\n\nWhen we arrived home I remember telling my grandma that I saw a christmas elf in the park and she laughed and said:\"That's great\" or something (I knew she didn't believed me), my dad was also laughing. The following days I kept thinking about it but with time I just went on with the idea that my dad told some man to dress up as an elf and jump in the sewer for me to see to make me believe in the magic of christmas.\n\nWell, a few years later I finally asked him about it and he said that he never did this and asked me more about what I saw. I told him and he said that it was probably just my wild imagination and being little. However, I know exactly what I saw and I remember it clearly to this day.\n\nI even went to the same exact park since then to inspect the area but a lot has changed since then and that place looks totally different now, no walking path and no sewer hole, just plain grass. \n\nWhat's even weirder is that as years went by, whenever I remember that man I start comparing him more and more with myself. I only saw him briefly and from behind but I could see his hair and the color and type was just as mine, also his back looked like mine in some pics I took after I grew up. But this might be just me overthinking it throughout time.\n\nAnyway, this was my little story and whether you believe it or not, it's the second strangest thing that has ever happened to me.",

        "text": "There have been no known deaths in our home,  but the other night I was hearing odd noises. I got up and used my spirit box for the first time.  My father died about 5 years ago, and my brother passed less than a year ago, so of course I asked if they were around.  I got no response from that. I asked if our cat who had passed not long ago was still here.  In response I captured a woman's voice that said the name of our remaining living cat. Very odd!  I tried another session a couple nights later, and heard the name of our living cat once again. I asked, 'How do you know my cat?'. I got a 'That's my kitty cat' in response. A little while later I captured the same woman's voice saying 'Rocky'.  My dog's name was Rocky when I adopted him. We call him Buddy now. Buddy's back-story is that his previous owner was dying of cancer and had to give him up.  Buddy's previous owner had a lot of cats.\nI am under the impression that my dog's previous owner visits her old dog, but has a fondness for our cat. \nAlso captured was a male voice that said 'Micheal'.  About 4 months ago a truck towing a backhoe wrecked into a tree right behind our house.  It left the road and hit a big pecan tree. The backhoe and trailer crushed the driver. I was the first on the scene. I tried to help, but the cab of the pickup was so smashed I couldn't see anyone. I could hear gurgling coming from the truck. The best I could do is yell to them that help was on its way.  I didn't know it at the time, but I knew the guy driving. We were friends on Facebook.  He was a local musician that I had actually shared the stage with in the past.  \nI've had the spirit box for over a year. But I have not use it in my home until now. I don't want to open any portals or possibly invite any activity here. But it looks like someone is around us anyway.",

        "text": "So, I used to work at a haunted Halloween store. Anyone who worked there often had some creepy story from encountering the ghosts. We had a homeless man with a collection of dolls who lived out behind the store… he probably wasn’t the first. \n\nI bought an animatronic Pennywise clown from that store at a fantastic discount. I was so excited when I brought him home. He and my animatronic collection bring the neighborhood (and me and my family) so much joy around Halloween.\n\nMy house wasn’t haunted… now it is. I think there’s an entity attached to my Pennywise animatronic. \n\nWe’ve had him since 2019. Every time I bring him upstairs, stuff starts happening. Lights flicker. One time, he moved—turning his whole body toward me while I was sitting in my chair. He wasn’t plugged in. Even if he had been, his body doesn’t move like that. Another time, his eyes glowed—my husband saw this one, too, if I remember right—and again, he wasn’t plugged in. I got the distinct impression he wanted to go back into the basement. I did an EVP &amp; video session when I was alone with my toddler asleep and I caught distinct, rhythmic bangs on the wall next to me—not anywhere near the room my toddler was in. I also caught a possible light anomaly. Later, I hadn’t put him back in the basement yet, and I caught a growl.\n\nWe put him back into the basement after Halloween. My husband set him up so he’s looking out the window. A few odd things happened—helpful things. I was looking for something all over—I’d looked in my bedroom multiple times. I go back in there, and there the thing was—right in front of my nightstand. It hadn’t been there before. Music started playing on my phone when I needed to be somewhere and I hadn’t set my alarm. You would’ve had to deliberately push a button to get this music to play.\n\nThen it just… stopped. It was like he was saying, “Thanks for putting me back in the basement—and with a view!” And has settled down.\n\nHowever… when I’m going through a hard time… I will smell cig. smoke, and sometimes the smell that comes from drinking certain hard drinks … no one—NO ONE—in my house uses that stuff. Yet sometimes the smell is so strong, I can taste it. I’ve also smelled perfume, and no one wears perfume in my house—I have a sensory sensitivity to smell, most perfumes make me sick. That’s when I really wish I had a spirit box. I have questions. But… I really don’t want to invite anything else into my home. I’m fine with this Pennywise ghost. They’re not mean. But I don’t want anything negative in my home. It’s our sanctuary. \n\nBut…\n\n(TL;DR:) I want to talk to this ghost in my home. Do you consider spirit boxes safe to use, or do they invite bad things in?",

        "text": "I've only posted once prior to this in reference to another experience I've had related to the paranormal. This time I thought it would be interesting to tell a short and sweet story about my first experience with the paranormal that I remember as a child.\n\nI'm currently a 38F and my first experience took place when I was approximately 3-4 years old. I can't remember my exact age but I do remember I was still wearing those cartoon character footie full-body pajamas that were popular in the 80s for kiddos that zipped all the way from the toe to the chest. \n\nOh my goodness I'm just cackling thinking about them. Why oh why was that zipper so long? Okay, I'm getting off track! Back to the story.\n\nDuring that time my great grandmother, we'll simply call her \"Nanny\", on my mom's side was living in a nursing home. At that age I'd never known her to live anywhere else. From what I knew then and heard from my mom later, Nanny loved me to pieces. She loved getting visits from my brother and me. Of course, there were times she terrified me by halfway spitting out her dentures on purpose but that's another story entirely! \n\nOne night in particular, my mom put me to bed as usual. I remember nodding off and started dreaming. I was suddenly awoken. Not in a scary way but as if someone had been calling my name trying to get me to wake up in a soft voice.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes and looked around I finally saw Nanny standing next to me by my bed. At the time I didn't find her change in appearance weird or abnormal as she looked like herself to me. I could see her whole body and she was dressed in a light colored white or cream colored long dress, almost like a fancy nightgown and at least 20 years younger than I knew her to be. She had a glass of milk in her hands and asked me if I was thirsty. I realized that I did feel a little parched and said yes. As I stuck my hand out to take the offered drink, she swirled out of focus and reappeared farther away in my bedroom, toward my closet.\n\nShe waved to me and said, \"I only came to tell you I love you and that I will see you again someday real soon.\"  She then turned toward the closet and walked away, fading out of sight as she went.\n\nAfterward, I quickly went to sleep and awoke the next morning smelling this amazing smell. I could even envision what they were. Biscuits! Large, fluffy, buttery, flaky biscuits that were the size of my head. They smelled so amazing! I knew that meant Nanny had decided to stay and make us all breakfast. I was so excited that I jumped straight out of bed and flew toward my door, almost knocking my mom back in the process from surprise that I was there.\n\nShe asked me what I was so excited about and I told her it was because I could smell Nanny's biscuits baking in the oven and I wanted to see her and eat them. I could imagine slathering butter on them and sprinkling them with sugar. \n\nAt the time I didn't interpret her look well, only knowing that her face went ashen for a quick second. She then changed her look and got down to my level to explain to me that it's not possible because Nanny had been in the hospital for some time and went to heaven the night prior. I was distraught but unbelieving as I could still smell those biscuits. I'm not sure how long it took for my mom to convince me but I do remember that I made her let me walk in the kitchen and through the entire place to see there was no sight of my Nanny anywhere. My heart boke that day yet I also knew that heaven was a great place and that she was likely having a great time until we could see her again. (As I'd been told before about people passing.)\n\nSomething I didn't find out until years later when I brought up that long ago memory was my mom's side of that story. \n\nShe told me the moment I told her about the biscuits she was quite shocked. Like I stated before, mom said I'd never known Nanny prior to her being in the nursing home so I was never able to experience her biscuits or any other types of cooking. My mom went further to say that the topic of their meals growing up also never came up when I was around.\n\nShe explained that growing up, her family was quite poor. However, due to the older members living through the great depression they learned to stock up on certain canned and pantry food items. One thing in particular they ate a lot were these biscuits. Nanny was known around the family for these gigantic fluffy concoctions that were big enough to be a meal on their own. Everyone would put butter on them in the mornings with sugar and cinnamon or eat them for dinner with beans.\n\nShe said that day if she'd had question about the other side, my description of a thing I'd literally never heard of nor witnessed was a testament to that.",

My dad was driving and had his window down because the air conditioner wasn’t working. The car ride there was completely normal until some sort of black bug thing flew in the open window and landed on my dad’s neck. It was only for a split second because he instinctively grabbed it from the side of his neck and threw it at my feet on the passenger side of the car. There was a bit of clutter, so I didn’t see exactly where it landed, but I saw it being thrown to the ground. We both kind of freaked out about the fact it fit in his whole hand, so I rummaged around the floor to get it out of the car. I threw everything if front of me in the back seat after inspecting each item to make sure it wasn’t hiding, but there was no trace of its existence. I spent a good 20 minutes looking everywhere it could have been, but came up with nothing.\n\nMy dad said when he grabbed it, the creature fit inside his hand and had wings like a dragonfly that went in between his fingers. I hadn’t though about asking Reddit until we brought the experience back up. Idk if I should have put this is the “debunk this” category, but it’s pretty relevant to both tags. Does anyone know what the hell could have flew in our car only do completely disappear without a trace?",

It reminded me of our experience there and I wanted to post it. It wasn’t really a crazy experience, but it’s something we can’t explain.\n\nI think it was 2015. My mom, step dad, brother, and I went to Santa Paula just for fun but we decided to stay at the Glen Tavern Inn because we thought it would be cool to stay somewhere supposedly haunted. Right when we walked in, my mom said it felt like stepping in to a different dimension. My step dad started asking the man at the front desk if he’s ever had any paranormal experiences while working there. The man said yes and started talking about the things he would see. I think I remember him saying he would often see an older woman and a couple of kids in the hallways. He said he would hear laughter, voices, loud footsteps, and music that wasn’t actually playing. He also said the restaurant was quite active.\n\nSadly I don’t remember the floor or room we stayed in. Everything was pretty normal until my mom woke up around 5am. When she woke up, the bathroom faucet was turned on and the door to our room was open. I searched “Glen Tavern Inn” in this sub before writing this, and in one of the posts I found, someone also had an experience with the bathroom faucet turning on by itself. I thought that was interesting.\n\nAnyway, this was just a really simple experience, nothing crazy. I kind of wish we had seen something or experienced more but I know I would have been freaked out.",

        "text": "So let me tell you guys about what's been happening more frequently at my house. My wife continued to wake me up at night saying that she had heard something and was scared for a bit and I would get up and check inside and out of the house and never find anything. Then, I began hearing things during the day, the sounds were obviously household sounds like silverware, or something falling off a shelf, and such. Then, we would hear our dog bark, but then upon inspection to see what he was barking at he would be fast asleep. Then my family (It is my wife and I, my 10 year old daughter and my 4 year old son) began to hear each other talking when we weren't. The events are more curious than frightening but they definitely happen, fairly regularly.\n\nMy wife and I have had many discussions about the source of this and my wife is frightened that it is paranormal but I have another theory, and this theory came about one day when I heard what I thought was a shelf falling in our living room. When I went to inspect, everything was in it's place. However, later that day...a shelf in the living room fell. This caused me to think of this, I think that we can all agree that there are some brain shattering things being done in the realm of physics and with the LHC. What if what we are hearing isn't from another place, but another time? I started to think that the things we were hearing may be us...just at another time?",

        "text": "Hi all! It’s my first time posting in here and I’m just looking for a bit of advice or help to understand what’s going on. My boyfriend and I moved to our house back in April. We haven’t had any strange occurrences happen up until this week, when multiple things have happened. It started when I was showering, and heard 3-4 knocks on the door. So naturally, I said hello, to which I got a response of more knocking. This went on 2 or 3 times before I stopped responding. I thought maybe it was my boyfriend, but I found out afterward he was in our living room/kitchen the entire time. Later that day, we were sitting on the couch relaxing, when the chandelier in the kitchen started swinging back and forth. It stopped after a few minutes but I was freaked out to say the least. Then, the other day, an ornament randomly fell off of the tree. To top it all off, this morning my boyfriend woke up to 3 huge scratches on his hand. All of this being said, we are trying to stay rational and calm but I feel that something is here in our home. What I don’t understand is why now, after being here for 7 months, have things started happening and if there is a reasonable explanation for all of this. Any advice or help is appreciated.",

It sounded like it was not happening in my head but not like someone was saying it, it came from the direction of my birds cage. It was telling me this “don’t look under the bed and always jump straight into the bed if you do this a head will float just to watch you” after this I was confused because these were not my thoughts at all so I still trying to sleep but not even 3 seconds later I get this horrible feeling of absolute fear like something was watching me it felt like if I moved talked or opened my eyes something bad will happen I was frozen with fear I tried to open my eyes but they would not open there was this pressure that felt so horrible it made me stuck soon the pressure was gone but I was still in fear, the feeling of still being watched was still there so I quickly lifted my covers and covered myself whole in the blankets hoping this was just a dream. I woke up some hours later to realize it was not a dream, because I did not forget about it not even hours have gone by. I am still to freaked out about going back to room, because it felt like the voice was trying to warn me of what was going to happened but I can’t put my finger on what the voice sounded like.",

        "text": "It's been a few months since I've posted. Obviously, something has happened to change that, and I'm in need of a bit of advice. For those who don't remember account names or my posts, I'm sensitive to non-physical entities around me. It's like a splinter in the back of my mind that says \"I'm not alone\", and I can narrow down what direction it's coming from. I'm also aware of when such entities have taken notice of me. I've taken to the \"You're not welcome here. Please leave.\" approach with a gentle but forceful tone to evict entities via boundaries. Let's start with some context to the first \"weird shit\" occurrence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dad, mom, and I take turns playing each other in Backgammon while we eat dinner at a bar countertop-styled dinner table. The kitchen, dining room, and living room make up one large open room. A few nights ago, we were eating together when I went to move my foot and felt that I had practically kicked one of my fur baby kitties in the shoulder and into the side of the bar counter. I immediately started looking around to see which one of them it was so I could apologize with love and head rubs. My mom saw my mini-freak out and asked what happened. After I explained, she pointed out that all three of my kitties had bedded down on the couch cushions for an evening nap after I fed them at the start of dinner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to late last night for the next \"weird shit\" moment. Thanks to working fast food in my twenties, my natural sleep schedule will occasionally switch to a nocturnal schedule despite numerous attempts to fix it and this week has been one such time. Something was roaming the living room late last night, and it spotted me in an instant while I was in the kitchen. It had what felt like an unhealthy and alarming interest in me. To put it in words, it felt like the entity was trying to cling to me from behind in a way that made my skin crawl. The entity stopped following me when I returned to my room. I wouldn't be surprised if it's related but the hallway mirror that's next to the living room was giving off an unnerving vibe earlier in the night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnlike normal beds, mine is a large legless \"box\" with multiple storage drawers built into it and a mattress on top of it. I heard something hit the side of my bed a bit after the living room incident. To describe the volume, I heard it over listening to music with noise canceling headphones. I would have to kick the crap out of my bed or slam one of the drawers to match the volume of what I heard. Right after, I had the same sort of unnerving feeling I had in the living room coming from my bed, and promptly said it wasn't welcome and needed to it. I had to say it multiple times before the entity by my bed finally left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, we have tonight. It wasn't as loud but I heard a thump come from my bed. Yet again, an entity was in the same spot and felt like the entity from last night. The entity gave off much less of a worrisome feeling than last night. Yet, it still felt antagonistic. So, it got evicted via the phrase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil now, I don't think I've ever felt the same entity approach me twice, and I definitely haven't encountered one before that would try to defy a declared boundary. What am I potentially dealing with here? Did I somehow mess up in establishing boundaries? Any potential insight will be greatly appreciated.",

It is an historical building called the Blackman House. I need to research its history as it is the only house in this area.\n\nAfter a couple hours we were walking back towards the tram, passing by the house. By then it was almost midnight.\n\nI have a habit of looking over my shoulder in the city, to check my surroundings and keep check on people nearby.\n\nAs we are walking by the house I was keeping aware of my surroundings but felt like someone was walking behind us, and yet no one was there. \n\nJust as we were about to cross the street, leaving the park and the house behind us, my friend says ‘dude it totally feels like somebody has been walking right behind us’. \n\nThis sent chills down my spine as I was just thinking the same thing to myself!\n\nI said aloud, waving my hand back and forth ‘go away, quit following us, you aren’t welcome fk!’\n\nWe crossed the street and I turned to take a photo of where we just walked. Ya know, just to see if I might catch something. \n\nThere was a lady walking towards us on another intersecting trail, behind the house, about 50 yards away. I waited until she was blocked by a tree so that she was not in the photo. \n\nWeird thing is, while reviewing the photo yesterday; there she is, probably a good two seconds past the tree, and her image is eerily transparent at certain places like her feet. \n\nSo the image is creepy. But you know how those iphones take a second to complete the photo with the night setting they have, like the lens is collecting ambient light for the night photo? Well, I attribute the creepy image to that. But who knows? Maybe she wasn’t really there and was a ghost, and I caught her on film?\n\nAnyway, a few blocks later we were crossing another street to the tram station and we both had that feeling again as the cold wind blew rustling leaves across the pavement behind us.\n\nI was telling my wife about it later on the phone and she said ‘I wonder if (my friend’s wife) was with you guys, I hope she’s ok’. Well that was a thought, as she had been in a medically induced coma for several days and near death.\n\nMy friend’s wife is still in hospital but is now conscious and communicating. Hoping for the best outcome for her.\n\nI have since returned home to Seattle and decided to share this story with you. Peace",

        "text": "I’m 16 right now and around 5 years ago lived in this big house I didn’t believe in ghost or anything like that. After living there for a couple years I had never experienced anything out of the ordinary so I wouldn’t really be scared of the house my parents room was on the floor above and I would go see them every night. For some reason every night for around a week I went up there and I would see this woman with a white dress just looking at herself in the mirror I would close my eyes for a second and she disappeared so I just ran upstairs super scared but wouldn’t say anything to my parents after since no they don’t believe in that stuff. After a week of this happening I talked with some friends and they told me it wasn’t real so I spent couple minutes in my room that night saying to myself that she was not real and if she was she had to leave. The next night I went to the same place but she wasn’t there anymore. She was in the stairs lead to my parents room. After that night I never saw her again. Im not scared or feel sad about this but every time I think about her even after years I start to tear up.",

        "text": "also i am bad at story telling, so i will just say it as if i am talking to a friend. \n\nI had this one happen to me in 2014. I live in Tasmania Australia, and there's a place called Port Athur. it was a convict settlement, and there's also a small town. the historic site has a  penitentiary, a silent prison, a hospital, church and many more things.  Anyway, we were on a night ghost tour and we went down to this basement like place where they had a like, almost a table thing that was made out of sandstone or something. from my memory, they used that table to dissect bodies and stuff. on the tour, we were all standing around that table in the dark with a small lantern. the tour guide was telling stories and i was 14 and especially scared. i started to shake and this random woman puts her hand on my arm to comfort me and says \"it's ok \"Holly, there's nothing to be afraid of\" while this happened, i felt very calm and almost like i was in a trance. then she just kind of disappeared? i didn't see her disappear but she wasn't there anymore. mind you, you aren't allowed to just leave the tour, it is a little far from the main center and if you do have to leave, the tour guide will take you or you just will have to wait. the tour guide did not leave. also i didn't remember seeing her before and she was never there afterwards. my friend and their dad actually saw it too but again, it was weird and hazy and like a dream? now the weird thing is, it wasn't a women in old 1800's clothing, but one in light 80's workout fashion but also casual. there was a massacre in port Arthur in 1996, doesn't explain the 80's style but still weird. Also, how did she know my name? my name was never spoken but then again, it was ages ago. I believe in the paranormal, but am incredibly skeptical about things i see still. it honestly could have been a random women who heard my friend say my name and comforted me, maybe she walked off without knowing she wasn't allowed to and the tour guide didn't notice. and maybe i just didn't notice her at all before it happened. really weird... what are your thoughts?",

        "text": "\nI am going to tell you something that has been bothering me for quite some time. Right now I am convinced that this is not just illusions that happens in my head. I never tell anyone about this before because I doubt people would even believe what I said. But now I can't keep this to my self alone anymore and I decided to make this thread.\n\nI've been noticing something peculiar that happen when I tried to recall any of my past memories, specifically the one when there are other persons in it. It could be any memories that happened in my real life, a scene from a movie or other sources. \n\nThe strange thing is they are not my original or actual memories like they should be anymore. They are similar memories like before but there is something different. When I tried to recall that kind of memories, I've been noticing something surprising with the **peoples** in them. I don't know how the best way to describe this but I think I could say that they are **alive**. What I mean by alive is that they are capable **to change**. Change from their original state. It could be their **speeches** or **motions** but they are **different** from what they are supposed to be. It seems like my original memories are being modified or replaced with a new ones. This phenomena really caught my interest.\n\nAt first I think I might be hallucinating stuff but there are reasons that made me change my mind. It is because even though they are quite vague, I could still make out the contents of their speeches and sometimes they corresponds with what I'm thinking at the time. That is they are responding to my monologue.\n\nMy realization about this really surprised me and it made me change my perception about our world because this phenomena has so many implications. I could elaborate this further but first I want to know if this happen to other people too. I want you to check and clarify this thing yourself. That is experimenting with your own memories.\n\nHere I will explain how to do this correctly step by step.\n\n1. Find a quite place where you could concentrate and focus without any disturbance.\n\n2. Take a deep breath and calm yourself down.\n\n3. Pick and recall a memory from a distant past that you could remember vividly. It need to have other peoples in them. Preferably the ones who are talking. People who had a conversation with you, a dialogue in a movie or a talk show, a reporter of a news channel, a narrator or other memories with similar nature.\n\n4. Focus and take extra attention to the person *(this is important)* and said a word or more in your head (like apple or any other words of your preference would do). Both of this should happen simultaneously in a second.\n\n5. Maintain your memory as best as you can and keep your attention to the person! They may mimic your word or doing something different than what they did originally!\n\nIf you do this correctly, you might be able to notice the changes that happen to the peoples in your memory. Please do this several times and tell your experience about it here. This could be a groundbreaking evidence that could shed a light to the nature of our world that we never knew before.",

You might not think it’s that creepy, but for someone who spent the majority of their adult life not believing in god, paranormal, angels, demons, etc. These occurrences straight shook me to my core. Hope you enjoy the story, feel free to share your opinion on whether I’m over reacting or if this is weird shit 😂\n\nMy mom had battled cancer for over 9 years. We never had a great relationship but while it was tumultuous I would never argue she was a strong lady. She started declining really fast a couple of months before my wedding and to our surprise she ended up making it to it! She was frail, under 100 lbs and still got her ass on the dance floor. \n\nShe went into hospice on a Monday. She was tough to convince that it was time for hospice but when she lost most bodily functions and was in too much pain she finally agreed. She was coherent, although tired. I work from home so I had been in and out of hospice that week as work permitted. Every day seemed the same as the last, no change, still coherent. \n\nThursday came around and I was sitting at my computer when I suddenly got this overwhelming feeling that I needed to go to hospice. I shrugged, called my coworker (cousin) and told her. She immediately said “if you feel this, you need to GO. NOW.” I rolled my eyes assuming it was just anxiety. I decided I’d get ready to leave anyways since it was a slow work day. As I’m getting ready my other coworker (practically a surrogate mother) called me and asked how I was. I told her about the feeling and she basically echoed what my cousin said, but added “that’s weird, I just finished praying for you and hoping you’d make the right decision. I just felt called.” At this point I was like “what the fuck?” So I get my laptop bag on and as I’m walking out the door my phone rings AGAIN. This time it’s my dad. He sounds somber and just says “it’s time, the death rattle has started, she doesn’t have much time.”\n\nSo I get in my car and fly to hospice. I get there, meet with family, and spend time alone with her saying my goodbyes. I got there probably a little before noon, and she passed away before 2. I was shook, apart from the trauma of watching my mother die the feeling I got that told me to go was so outrageous to me. I realized there’s a likelihood that even though our relationship was rocky, we were connected. She always had this weird mom instinct to check in whenever I was home alone even when she had no idea I was alone 😂\n\nFast forward a few months and her sister calls me and says some creepy shit happened to another cousin of mine. I’ll preface this by saying both my mother and this cousin had partners that were notoriously cheaters. Recently this cousins husband had cheated and my cousin made the decision to stay with her husband. My aunt called to tell me that MONTHS after my mothers death my cousin got a text from my mother that said “he never changed.” I was floored. I couldn’t even, and still can’t to this day. I try to tell myself that both of these things have to have a logical explanation but it is just SO bizarre.\n\nObviously I still teetered on being a skeptic- what do you think?! Sorry for the typos and not great articulation, writing from my phone this novel has proven more difficult than I thought.",

        "text": "I got pregnant around September of last year so we decided to move in together a year sooner than expected. He was working the same place at the time and had no problems with his drives home. We moved barely out of our city into more of the country outlining it. During his night time drives he passes houses with big yards filled with horses, open fields, some have cows, it's all pretty packed together but still more than the city.\n\nHe was never a strong strong believer but was not specifically skeptical when it came to my many paranormal stories in my old homes. I was surprised the first time he woke me up about 2:30am to tell me the scary ass shit he has encountered. He is an irresponsible driver, he smokes weed at work along with the rest of the pizza making crew before leaving.\n\nThis time he had just hit it and left. It's dead of the night, no police or anyone else around leaving the city, getting on the pretty much straight shot road to our home. He says while passing by these opened field houses he saw a giant grey humanoid creature cowering by the side of the road that then moves behind the fence while my boyfriend is driving by. Then within the next 5 minute drive to our home his radio-which he is always having problems connecting to when I'm in the car but works perfectly fine when it's just him in the car- starts going static and a voice talks to him through it.\n\nHe books it into our apartment, comes straight to the bedroom to wake me up and tell me what happened. I was creeped out, he was creeped out- more like terrified really. It happens again like maybe the next week? It was a year ago and has happened in different ways multiple times. The second time was the scariest though. \n\nThis time the grey man was on the side of the road again crouching over and then it chased after my boyfriend going 50mph. My boyfriend got away, obviously, pulled into his parking spot and the road went static and the voice said in a broken voice again saying something about him getting away. Again fucking terrifying when he woke me up to tell me. This was in the winter of last year and it started happening again.\n\nIdk if it's hallucinations driven by weed since he smokes a lot of weed &amp; Dab. Idk if he's attracting the energies after the first couple of times bc now he doesn't think he's protected cause he thought I put a protection spell on his car and I recently revealed to him I didn't and now suddenly it's happened again. Idk if it's just the season, but it's scary and I thought hey maybe other people would like to hear me say crazy paranormal shit so yea, hi.",

        "text": "Some years back I was having sex with my ex, I look down she looks scared almost. I ask if she's ok she says yeah. After we're done I ask her why she looked scared she said that for a little bit my face looked like it had transformed or something. I remember specifically she said it looked like I had a horse snout. At that point in time I thought she was just pretending to be crazy or something. I just tell her had to be the lighting like a trick of the eye.  Another day it got brought up and after the conversation she asks me if I'm an alien. I thought she was joking but then I looked at her face and you could see it in her eyes  that she was serious. I tell her no and she starts to say if you are one I wouldn't care shit like trying to convince me if I were an alien to admit it. Then I believe she really saw what she said she saw, that she is really crazy. But then a week ago I  was watching a video about paranormal experiences from 4chan or reddit and there was an experience that was very similar to my situation but there's some details in the story I know it wasn't my ex . Some lady was having sex with her ex  and she said his face transformed and it had a horse snout and the lady thought he was some creature that's mask had slipped in the heat of the moment. I now think my ex really saw what she said she saw and she's not crazy. Please tell me wtf happened.",

Lived in a VERY old farm house on many many acres of land and I have always heard stories about the ghost who lived there. Apparently me or my brother or my cousins or all of us would be screaming and crying and next thing you knew when you went into the room we were all starting at the same corner every time and we would just laugh and coo at the corner. We even started “talking” when we first learned how to talk. Our dogs were also very interested in this corner. I do not see too many good stories about ghosts but I think it’s important to know not all paranormal entities want to cause harm our hurt you!",

        "text": "Hey all, I wanted to start this by saying I am skeptical of a lot of claims, while also a full believer in paranormals myself.\n\nEver since I was a kid, I have seen, interacted with, and felt the presence of spirits. As a toddler with a vocabulary of about 10 words, I allegedly would look up at the corner is the room my crib was in and laugh for hours. When asked who I was talking to, I would say a grandmother, whim had been dead YEARS before I was born and had never met. I was a sickly kid close to death multiple times. When my health stabilized, my mother says, I stopped talking to my grandmother. \n\nI grew up in a haunted house that has different intities with distinct patterns and personalities. It was here that I truly began to experience. \n\nAround age 8 I opened up to my mother about seeing shadow people and disfigured people. I would see them at random intervals. They would be like randomly in the street quickly moving in a straight line, as if in a race. Later, it developed to they could see me. They would be moving but could look at me. Then they were sometimes standing still, hiding behind walls and poles, and would stare into my soul. I always felt like it was because they figured out that I could see them.\n\nAround the age 13 I developed this \"Spidey sense\" that has been almost 100% accurate to some form of radiating energy. It's similar to butterflies or goosebumps, but it's in the top of my head and spins in a circle like a whirlpool. The intensity increases the closer I get, or it gets. This has let me know seconds before a creepy moment happened like a body apparition. It also has in the past been set off in front of buildings or even driving by. \n\nAround the age of 16 I developed into visualizing colors with it. Like a heat source... Not like the colors we associate with emotion. Ranging from blue as docile, to black as the one demon I have encountered and a split second siting of a long 3 fingered hand with long nails. \n\n\nAlong with all this, I seem to attract spirits. Like I said, everything I see now is staring at me. I haven't seen a spirit not staring at me in over a decade. (not that I see them all the time or anything like that) but I appear to be a magnet. Places that have never had activity (or at least no unlocked activity) will start to get activity. It doesn't stay. It's just like I opened the front door and something came in for a bit then left, or passes right on by. \n\n\nI've settled with this for YEARS and never wanted to say anything like physic. I HAVE talked to spirits and have seen too many to count, but it's not like I'm asking questions into the void for answers or have foresight. I don't really even have the ability to just be like \"oh yeah I feel a female mid 20s wearing a pink polka dot dress she's sad\" idek if that is real. All I know is what I experience and what I have done before memory as a tiny thing. If someone could help me to put a name to my \"skill\" and or give me connection to develop/learn about it, I would be grateful. I'm not scared of it at all both from the amount of experiences I've had, and my faith in Jesus Christ. I appreciate any help!",
