        "text": "It was a bright morning,birds singing,water running through the river and the smell of fresh bread from the kitchen,i've been on my aunt's farm for a couple days to enjoy college vacations but me and my parents also were visiting new places from the area we haven't heard of like restaurants,rivers,nearby cities and etc.\nOn the other day we went to visit another farm from a family's friend,the place sure was huge,it think almost double the size and had a path leading to a vast forest and grassland. We decided to stay for a bit and being bored,went to explore the forest. It didn't have much but it was a relaxing walk. I reached the end of the path and sat down for a while watching the land then i decided to return,on the way back i tripped and almost hit my head but once i got up again i noticed the area was getting covered in thick fog,i got nervous as i couldn't see properly besides a few feet so my only option was carefully to follow the path back. I was going ok until i heard something pass behind me,it sounded like running and i couldn't tell where exactly it was coming from,the fear was starting to build but eventually i felt numb and fell unconscious.\nI woke up the next day on my bed,my parents clearly worried about my state:\n\"We found you laying cold unconscious on the path,what happened there?!\" My mother asked,clearly worried.\n\"I...don't know,i just felt numb when the fog surrounded me and i heard things...\"\n\"I don't know what happened but what fog are you talking about?\" My father asked confused.\n\"Wait,wasn't the forest all foggy?\"\n\"No,it was all clear all the time.\"\nAfter we returned back home i still had doubts in mind,what could that fog be? I don't know if i was hallucinating or if there really was fog but i decided to shrug it off.\nA few days later we went to the park and decided to go hiking on the trail,but since i was all excited i sprinted through the wooden bridge and got too far ahead of my relatives and reached the second half of the trail,as i stopped to rest by a tree i realized fog was starting to form again but since i ran a lot i lost track of the trail. I was starting to get scared,fearing what could show up from the woods and get so i ran around yelling for anyone that could hear,anyone that knew where we were until i eventually found a couple on another trail,they guided me back to the park until i managed to reunite with my relatives and tell them about the sane fog but it still didn't seem to convince them.\nAt this point i thought i was getting paranoid but not ready to give up,i called some friends that i could trust onto this plan and explained them everything,we all had geared up,one brought some vests for a bit more protection in case of an attack,i brought flashlights,another brought some bats for defense and the last one brought a camera and we all went on the same trail. It was eerie but we managed to keep each other clse enough to not separate while filming any possible encounter,it took a while but it arrived,and just as our vision got limited  we turned on our flashlights and tried to stay as close as possible,then we all heard rustling and running again,we all froze in terror,keeping an eye on all directions and staying alert with our bats in hand.\nEventually the sounds started to get closer and they came from one of the sides,we kept paying max attention to what could appear and just as one of the swung their bat they hit something that ran away fast enough for us not to see but it left what seemed to be green blood,that was enough reason for us to leave and we all ran back to the car as we marked our way with a thick yellow line to lead us back and we all followed it back to the main park area,all while hearing shrieks and more running behind us and what felt like a cold scratch on my ankle.\nIn the end we managed to get out of the forest but whatever was following us it managed to scratch my ankle and left a bloody mess. I got my wound treated and i never managed to explain to my parents what really happened,even after checking the camera recording we couldn't make what really was the thing but it was obvious it was not human. Ever since then i've kept saying the same warning to everyone who tells me they're going to visit forested areas and this also goes for whoever is reading:If you're walking around the woods and fog starts to form randomly,track your way back to safety,you never know what's behind you when you can't see.",

        "text": "Long story short my family is being stalked by something. I hope I found the right thread for this. First the basics, I guess. I am 30F (Kyndra)  and my wife is 31 (Iris). When my now wife and I first met and lived together we resided in Atlanta, Georgia. Recently my wife‚Äôs father decided to move to Florida and gifted us his fully paid off house in Ohio. As a born and raised Southerner I have never enjoyed the cold and the prospect of driving in snow was enough to spring tears to my eyes long before the first snowflake hit the ground. Regardless I would rather live rent free and pay property tax once a year than paying $1500 in rent every month. Sorry I‚Äôm rambling, my wife says I do that a lot. \n\nWe moved over into our new home/her childhood home two years ago. We packed up our two rambunctious pups and drove the Uhaul 11 hours to settle in Wyatt, Ohio. The first few months was spent updating the place from the throwback 1950s style that clung to the place worse than dust in an attic. I‚Äôm talking yellow painted kitchen walls with tractors and pipes that even my plumber was afraid to touch. The house is situated in a small township and when we moved back the neighbors were excited to see the return of the prodigal daughter. I guess her dad was a bigshot in the town after serving as fire chief for 40 years. Not to mention her family basically still runs the town. Cousins, aunts, and uncles are embedded so deep in the network of the town that you would think only their family was allowed to live there. \n\nAfter the renovations were done, we had a housewarming party. I guess social gatherings are a big deal in a town like this since everyone, even people we didn‚Äôt invite showed up. The party was perfect, everyone brought food, gifts and insight into the things that had changed since my wife left. Unlike my extremely extroverted wife who mixes and mingles like salt, I was more than happy to focus my attention to the food on the grill. It was while I was standing at the grill that I first heard it. \n\n‚ÄòKyndra can you come here please,‚Äù it was my wife‚Äôs voice, but it seemed to be coming from the front yard. \n\nI figured she had gone around to the front to grab something from our cars, so I sat down the tongs and made my way towards the front. Suddenly a warm hand slipped into mine and I came face to face with my wife. \n\n‚ÄúWhere you going?‚Äù she chirped, pressing a kiss to my cheek. \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äîdidn‚Äôt you just ask me to come to the front?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúNo,‚Äù her laughter filled my ears, ‚Äúyou always were a lightweight. Come on let me introduce you to my best friend Leslie.‚Äù \n\nI allowed her to lead me back into the crowd of people, but confusion still played at my mind the rest of the party. \n\nWhen the party began to wind down, I found myself nursing a bottle of water and staring into the slowly dying embers of the firepit. The chair next to me creaked as someone sat down. I turned my head to see Leslie whom I had met earlier. Leslie looked like all of the other women in my wife‚Äôs family: heart-shaped faces, golden eyes flecked with hints of green or blue, and dark brown hair life fresh ground coffee. \n\n‚ÄúHey. You okay? You looked very deep in thought,‚Äù she said smiling. \n\n‚ÄúYeah. Just‚Äî‚Äù I cut myself off, knowing how insane it would sound to say it out loud. \n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Leslie leaned back, the embers of the fire illuminating the curiosity in her gaze. \n\n‚ÄúEarlier I thought I heard Iris calling my name from the front of the house, but she said she didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs stupid, I was probably tipsier than I thought,‚Äù I sighed and took a deep swallow of water. \n\nFor a moment, Leslie didn‚Äôt respond, causing me to turn my gaze back to the woman. The look on her face was one of pure terror. At the time I shrugged it off, thinking that it was some trick of the dying light, but now I‚Äôm not so sure. Never the less she dismissed herself quickly from my presence and soon after she and all the other guest left in a rush. \n\n‚ÄúThat was a fun party,‚Äù Iris hummed, handing me another dried dish to place into the cupboard. \n\n‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I replied, focused more on watching our dogs happily playing outside, their energetic flips and pounces illuminated by the strings of light on our fence. \n\nIris‚Äô arms wrapped around me, bringing my attention back to her as she laid her head against the middle of my back. I sighed and closed my eyes, chastising myself for overthinking a trick of too much alcohol and hickory smoke. I turned, putting my hands on her waist before spinning us to press her against the countertop. She giggled; her eyes seemingly darker as I moved in for a kiss. At that moment every light on the fence went out. Almost simultaneously we heard a yelp and the slam off our dogs‚Äô bodies against the storm door. I threw the door open and both our dogs came racing in, immediately running to the living room. I stood there dumbfounded for a moment before a voice seemed to scream in my head. \n\nCLOSE THE DOOR!\n\nI slammed the both the storm door and wooden ones closed, locking them both. Iris laughed and reached for the lock. \n\n‚ÄúCalm down everyone, the breaker probably needs reset. I can get it,‚Äù she said her voice tinged with laughter. \n\n‚ÄúNO!‚Äù I shouted.\n\nMy yell brought her up short and she stared at me for a moment. I tried to find the words to tell her that something in the back of my mind was telling me that we shouldn‚Äôt go out there right now. \n\n‚ÄúThe boys seemed spooked by something. Colt and Hex aren‚Äôt easily frightened,‚Äù I finally said, using her soft spot for our twin dalmatians as leverage instead of saying that it seemed like there was a presence outside. \n\nI wasn‚Äôt sure how to explain to her that even then as we stood next to the door it felt like we were being watched, as if someone were standing in the darkened yard watching and waiting for us to venture out. \n\n‚ÄúTrue, but I could always just take the gun with me,‚Äù Iris offered. \n\n‚ÄúWe can go in the morning, besides one of the boys may be hurt. Remember the yelp we heard.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúMy babies!‚Äù she shouted then running off to the living room to check on the dogs. \n\nI double checked the doorknob pulling it hard to make sure it didn‚Äôt budge. It didn‚Äôt but as I leaned in it felt like the presence I mentioned earlier moved closer. I stared into the darkened backyard, squinting to try and force my eyes to adjust. I gave up and joined my family in the living room where our two dogs were now curled into either side of my wife as she reclined on the sofa. \n\nColt and Hex have been our fur babies for two years after adopting them both from an animal shelter in Atlanta. The two are pure breed dalmatians that were dropped off at the shelter after the mother rejected them. Iris jumped at the opportunity to take them in, having come from a firefighter family and having dalmatians as the family pet her entire youth. Our boys were fearless and had proven that they were willing to go toe to toe with anyone and anything that sought to harm us. They had proven as much when our apartment was broken into while we were away at dinner one night when we still lived in Georgia. They had confronted the would be robber and forced them to hide in our bathroom, then barked until our next door neighbor came to check out the commotion and called the cops.\n\nSo, seeing them cowering in Iris‚Äô lap disturbed me. Iris had shrugged it off saying that the power going out had probably startled them and that Hex only had a small cut on his paw. She also reminded me that she had grown up in this neighborhood and more than once she had found herself aimlessly roaming the darkened streets with her friends for fun. \n\n‚ÄúThere is nothing here that will hurt us,‚Äù she had said as we laid in bed that night. \n\nI wanted to believe her. I still want to believe her but a few nights later things got weird again. \n\nI awoke from my sleep with a jolt, my eyes unfocused in the dim light of our bedroom. Sweat drenched my brow and I figured that I must have been having a nightmare, but the dream was fleeting. It melted away from my conscious brain like ice cream in the Georgia heat. I stood, swung my legs over the side of the bed and trudged into the master bathroom. Groggily I clicked my phone to life. 7am‚Ä¶disgusting. After using the bathroom, I had lain back down, tucking the covers underneath my chin when I heard it. \n\n‚ÄúKyndra,‚Äù my wife‚Äôs voice broke through the fog of sleep that had begun to settle on my mind like fresh fallen snow. \n\nI groaned, swung my feet back over the side of the bed and walked towards the bedroom door. \n\n‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù I asked reaching for the handle. \n\n‚ÄúKitchen.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù \n\nI bolted fully awake, my mind registering that I had heard overlapping voices. Slowly I turned to see my wife still lying in bed, but her gaze was fixed on me, her brow furrowed. \n\n‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù She asked, yawning then sitting up to wipe sleep from her eyes. \n\n‚ÄúI‚ÄîI was going to check on the boys,‚Äù I lied, I‚Äôm not entirely sure why. \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure their fine. Come back to bed,‚Äù she purred, inviting me over with the coil of her finger and a soft smile. \n\nI returned to bed and later that morning I awoke to our dalmatians asleep on the hardwood outside our bedroom door instead of on the couches in the living room where they had slept since we moved in. As I made my way downstairs, my gaze drifted to the front door. It was still locked, but there was a soft breeze coming from somewhere, making the floor cold under my feet. A window in the kitchen was open. The one that gave the view of our backyard. \n\nSince that night I have heard the voice three more times and each morning I find the dogs outside our door. Once their insistent scratching to be let in jolted me from sleep, and once they were inside our bedroom an insistent nagging at the back of my mind told me to lock it. I haven‚Äôt told my wife about this. I‚Äôm afraid that she will think I‚Äôm insane, but something is out there stalking my family and it‚Äôs getting bolder. \n\nAny ideas of what it could be and how do I stop it?",

Maybe it's because I'm afraid of what will happen if I don't.\n\nIt all started a few weeks ago, when I moved into a new apartment. It was a nice place, spacious and modern, with a balcony overlooking the city. The rent was affordable, and the location was convenient. It seemed like a perfect deal.\n\nBut there was something wrong with the apartment. Something very wrong.\n\nI noticed it on the first night. As I was lying in bed, trying to fall asleep, I heard a faint scratching sound coming from the wall behind me. It sounded like nails on wood, or maybe teeth on bone. It was rhythmic and persistent, like someone or something was trying to get in.\n\nI got up and turned on the light, hoping to scare away whatever was making the noise. But as soon as I did, the scratching stopped. There was nothing on the wall, no sign of damage or intrusion. Just a smooth white surface.\n\nI thought maybe it was a rat or a mouse in the wall, or maybe some pipes or wires making noise. I tried to ignore it and go back to sleep.\n\nBut the next night, it happened again.\n\nAnd the night after that.\n\nAnd every night since then.\n\nThe scratching never stopped. It only got louder and faster and more desperate. It sounded like whatever was behind the wall wanted out badly. And it knew I was there.\n\nI tried everything to make it stop. I banged on the wall with my fist, hoping to scare it away or at least make some noise of my own. But that only made it worse. The scratching became more frantic and angrier, like it was taunting me or challenging me.\n\nI tried covering my ears with pillows or headphones, but that didn't help either. The scratching seemed to penetrate my skull and echo in my brain.\n\nI tried calling the landlord and complaining about the noise problem in my apartment. But he said he couldn't hear anything when he came over to check it out. He said maybe I had tinnitus or some other ear condition that made me hear things that weren't there.\n\nHe said maybe I should see a doctor.\n\nBut I knew he was wrong.\n\nBecause one night, when I couldn't take it anymore,\n\nI decided to see what was behind the wall. What did I find behind the wall.\n\nI wish I could tell you. But I can‚Äôt.\n\nBecause I don‚Äôt remember.\n\nAll I know is that I grabbed a hammer and smashed a hole in the wall. And then I saw something. Something horrible. Something that made me scream and drop the hammer and run out of the apartment.\n\nAnd then I blacked out.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was in a hospital bed. The doctors said I had a seizure and collapsed on the street. They said they found me covered in blood and dirt and scratches. They said they didn‚Äôt know what caused it.\n\nThey said maybe it was stress or trauma or some kind of infection.\nThey said maybe I should see a psychiatrist. But I knew they were wrong. Because when they left me alone in the room,\n\nI HEARD THE SCRATCHING AGAIN!",

After the shit Annie and I had to witness today, I‚Äôm no longer sure we‚Äôll be able to return with our story. Maybe all we‚Äôll be in the end are faces printed on paper posters, piled up in a dust-ridden cabinet with the rest of them. I‚Äôm compelled to write these, so that at least someone out there will know where we went and what‚Äôs happening here.\n\nOkay, just needed to get that out there. Here‚Äôs the events of today.\n\n.\n\n‚ÄúHey, good morning. You sleep okay?‚Äù was my first sentence of the day, knowing full-well that neither I nor Annie got any sufficient rest. I don‚Äôt think anyone could after watching a mountain lion be torched into a mass of blackened flesh and bone by a giant spotlight in the sky.\n\nAfter we got up, I hesitantly went over to the remains of said animal to get a closer look. As a journalist, you have to overcome even the most repulsive of details for the sake of having an accurate write-up.\n\nAs I‚Äôd expected, the mountain lion now more resembled a flaky hunk of charcoal, completely burnt out. But even in this state, tiny flickering sprites of those pale flames danced around the edges of its frame, as well as inside its mouth. I took pictures, of course. All the more resources to use later on, however morbid.\n\nAnnie stood at a distance, letting me do the examination. She crossed her arms, each grasping the other, her face painted with a pitied grimace. She was most definitely reluctant, but her interest was stolen away after I pointed out the peculiar structure a mile or so up ahead. That isn‚Äôt to say she‚Äôd brushed off the situation though.\n\n‚ÄúWhat is that architecture? It‚Äôs so‚Ä¶ familiar, but not exactly,‚Äù Annie said, bemused, still with some lingering anxiety.\n\n‚ÄúReminds me a little of those Hindu temples. You know, the, er‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the word? Recursive?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI think the right term is ‚Äòtiered‚Äô, but yeah. If that there is an entrance, though, it looks more fitting for a Buddhist monastery,‚Äù replied Annie.\n\nI searched for the structure she was referring to and quickly came to a similar conclusion. We were still too far away to make out any finer details, but a large doorway on its left side was embraced by a curving, frame-like structure, accented with red and gold.\n\n‚ÄúWell? Should we go and check it out?‚Äù I asked.\n\nAnnie went to speak but hesitated, and the words sat on her tongue. She breathed, then said shakily,\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where that‚Ä¶ that *thing* was above there, right?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI mean, yeah, but it couldn‚Äôt penetrate a simple rock, let alone a whole building ‚Äì plus, it doesn‚Äôt seem to like the daylight. Come on, Annie. This could be the biggest scoop of our lives.‚Äù\n\nAdmittedly, I cringed a little at that last statement, but it seemed to lighten her mood a bit. It still took some more convincing, but eventually she acquiesced.\n\nGod, how could I have been so stupid. It wasn‚Äôt worth it. It REALLY wasn‚Äôt worth it.\n\nWe made it to the slope below the building in good time, but the climb was definitely the most challenging. The loose rocks and grass provided poor footholds, and I became confused as to how anyone was intended to travel to and from this place.\n\nBy the time we reached the top, we were both coated in sticky burrs from the knee down. Those spiky little balls, I mean, that cling on for dear life, no matter how you try to brush them off.\n\nIt was even more beautiful up close, intricately carved supports lining the outside, and the gold paint which glimmered with pride. We stood outside for a while, and I took some photos, obviously. During that time, we neither saw nor heard any signs of life at all ‚Äì while this eased us into entering, it also had a vaguely sinister undertone. All that was just feelings from first impressions, but we should have listened to our guts.\n\nEntering, we made it a short distance in before a robed figure revealed themselves from behind a pillar, with such elegance that the lustrous fabrics seemed to dance. Annie was startled, but I jumped backwards at least 3 feet.\n\nThe person, who we found was a man, was dressed in blue, red and white robes, and had a slightly off-putting haircut ‚Äì concentric rings of shaven hair centered around the top of his head. He looked between us once, twice, and his mildly irritated expression grew into a knowing smile.\n\n‚ÄúWelcome, friends. You understand this is trespassing, yes?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ yeah, um, sorry. We were hiking through the area and saw this place up above. Decided to check it out. We‚Äôll leave if it‚Äôs causing any trouble,‚Äù I apologised.\n\n‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt fret. This is a place of peace. If you‚Äôd like, I can show you around this haven; all I ask is that you not raise your voice.‚Äù\n\nI looked over to Annie, then back to the man, and nodded in silent agreement.\n\n‚ÄúWonderful. My name is Domimokah. I am a priest, of sorts.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNice to meet you,‚Äù we said in unison. I might have butchered the spelling of his name, but it‚Äôs correct, phonetically.\n\n‚ÄúPlease, follow me this way. There is much for you to see.‚Äù\n\nThis was crazy. What religion was being practiced here, I wondered. There weren‚Äôt any giveaways in particular, but my attention was quickly drawn to the bizarre layout of the place. We turned and snaked through narrow corridors, like navigating a maze. The thought occurred that, in an emergency, we might not be able to find our way out alone, but I pushed that notion away after Domimokah led us into a long room, wider than the passages before.\n\nThe sides of the chamber were carved into large steps, upon which sat several monks, appearing to be deeper in meditation than I thought possible. I could just barely make out the gentle rising and falling of chests, but no other movement otherwise.\n\nEach monk wore a strangely shaped hat. They were shaped like a funnel, one end wider as to fit over their heads, and the other, upper end also fanned out into a smaller, open mouth. I stealthily snapped some pictures of the scene, hoping our guide wouldn‚Äôt notice. He didn‚Äôt. Thought so, at least.\n\nAnnie piped up, intrigued,\n\n‚ÄúSo, how long do these guys stay like this? Per day, I mean.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh, it varies much. We have no desire nor need to rest in this state. Some have been communing here for months, others a year or more.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúA- what? A year? No one can meditate for that long, can they?‚Äù\n\nAnnie‚Äôs confused barrage had no effect on Domimokah, as he continued his slow strides down the length of the room.\n\n‚ÄúAs I have said, they commune, not meditate. You are indeed correct, even the most dedicated are unwilling to empty their mind for such long periods. That is not what our practice entails.‚Äù\n\nI was hooked now.\n\n‚ÄúCommuning? What do you mean?‚Äù\n\nHe did not reply, instead beckoning us to follow him to the next location of interest.\n\nAfter more of the same coiling tunnels, we emerged out into the biggest room yet. The outer walls were lined with small carved pillars which segmented the view of the scenery, and the floor was so polished I could practically see the pores on my face when I looked into it. Incense burners littered the area, and what appeared to be brass tools of some kind were hung on the pillars.\n\nBut, by far the most staggering feature, was the gargantuan object that rested in the center of the room. Dozens more monks encircled the object, all still and silent statues. The more I tried to work out what this thing was, the more I was pulled to it. There was some allure to it which transcended any rational explanation.\n\n‚ÄúAh, here we are. This, my friends, is our connection to the great Well, stalwart and steady.‚Äù\n\nAnnie was trapped in the same trance as I, and slowly circled the artefact in awe.\n\n‚ÄúIs it a tree?‚Äù she asked.\n\n‚ÄúDear me, no,‚Äù chuckled Domimokah, ‚Äúno. This is what remains of one of the nine beings. It is how we are able to communicate and weave our minds into the great Well.‚Äù\n\nUpon processing his words, I came to the realisation that we were standing before a skull of immense proportions. The symmetry gave it away, but it didn‚Äôt resemble any species I could think of, especially any of that size. The thing was bigger than a schoolbus.\n\nScaffolding adorned one side, with steps leading up to the top. The square plate on its crown looked out of place ‚Äì it looked like a wooden hatch, with a brass handle affixed.\n\nI thought back to what Domimokah had said, and a question came to mind.\n\n‚ÄúYou keep talking about this ‚Äòwell‚Äô, I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs metaphorical? Like, it‚Äôs not an actual well, where you‚Äôd bring out water from?‚Äù\n\nBefore I could get an answer, two others entered the room. The simple notion that there were more people here that weren‚Äôt among the unmoving monks shocked me, if only for a moment. Domimokah‚Äôs face lit up at this.\n\n‚ÄúGood morning, Yerhemmi! I see that this one is ready. Marvelous!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIndeed, his affinity for the Well is exceptional. I am sure of this,‚Äù said the man called Yerhemmi in a rather breathy voice. He escorted with him a monk of younger age, leading him to the wooden steps beside the great skull. They ascended, and upon reaching the top, Yerhemmi gently grasped the young man‚Äôs head and muttered something to him, in a whisper I couldn‚Äôt quite make out. His face was solemn in that moment, but that quickly fell away to a blank expression.\n\nThe man then turned and knelt down over the hatch, reaching out his hand and pulling it open. He remained on his knees, and bowed his head forward, where he remained still. At this point I started recording a video of the ordeal. This was way too interesting to pass off.\n\nYerhemmi then produced a metallic object from somewhere. I didn‚Äôt see how he could have stored it within his robes, but, nonetheless, there it was. It was a large, flat band shaped into a ring, bearing tiny mechanisms on the interior. Slit-like holes with thinner protrusions emerging from them.\n\nI began to grow concerned when he leant down and carefully fitted the object onto the young man‚Äôs head. Then, he‚Ä¶ fuck, it all happened so quick.\n\nYerhemmi engaged a lock of some kind, then with great force pulled out a lever from the ring I hadn‚Äôt noticed before. The switch was flipped 180, and the band was then twisted around the monk‚Äôs head.\n\nSo much blood gushed down the man‚Äôs face, it was a spilled paint can of crimson hue. He shuddered, whimpered, and cried all the while, struggling to stay in place as Yerhemmi performed one final twist. With it came a repulsive sound of suction as he pulled the tool up and away, taking with it the top of the monk‚Äôs skull.\n\nMy legs felt weak, and all I could muster was a frail whimper in response to what just happened. Annie, wide-eyed, had one hand on the wall behind us, steadying herself. I forgot my phone was still recording, only capturing my feet on the shiny floor, before I realised and stopped the video.\n\nSliding my phone away, I stammered out to no one in particular,\n\n‚ÄúI- uh, we, I think we should go now. Annie, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù\n\nDomimokah interjected,\n\n‚ÄúMy apologies, but I cannot allow that. You agreed to see all that is here, yes? You haven‚Äôt yet witnessed the full ceremony.‚Äù\n\nI made a move toward the doorway, and he brought his fingers to his lips in response. By blowing through his fingers, a high-pitched whistle rang out, and at the exact same moment four of the previously dormant monks shot up and walked toward us with purpose. In groups of two, they held Annie and myself by the arms and turned us to face the grotesque ritual once again.\n\nThis time, Yerhemmi held a pair of long-handled scissors, and inserted them into a slit made at the base of the young man‚Äôs skull. He snipped once, twice, three times, then removed the instrument.\n\nNext in the horrifying slideshow of surgical operations, he used what I presumed to be the same scalpel that had made the previous incision, and began to slice away at the edges of the exposed grey matter. Off peeled the translucent veil from the brain‚Äôs folds, and Yerhemmi allowed it to slide out into his hand with a wet slap.\n\n‚ÄúPlease, please, I don‚Äôt want to look, let us go!‚Äù I yelped, as Yerhemmi once more held the bloodied scissors. Reaching down into the vacant cranium, he went on to cut twice, severing what I can only imagine to be the poor man‚Äôs optic nerves, and I heard the monk whispering, ‚Äúdark, it‚Äôs dark‚Äù.\n\nI felt hot vomit churn in the back of my throat as the freed brain was held up, like Simba in the Lion King, before it was dropped into the open hatch, and it was gone.\n\nThe hatch was closed, and Yerhemmi returned to the monk with the circular instrument, still holding the skull‚Äôs upper half. He placed it back onto the man‚Äôs head, and fastened it with a twist of some dial or knob.\n\nBy this point, the monk whose body had been so violated now looked calm, serene. No more did agonised gasps escape his mouth, and his shivering slowed to a stop.\n\nYerhemmi bent down, then rose again holding a metal jug of some kind. He opened the lid, allowing steam to billow out, and plunged a brush inside. Bringing it out, I could see it was now coated in hot, melted wax, which he then painted around the head of the newly thoughtless monk.\n\nFinally, he produced another of those funnel shaped hats, and pressed it firmly onto the man‚Äôs head, holding it for several moments until the wax had set. It was over, thank god.\n\nThe monk rose to his feet, and was escorted back down the scaffolding. After reaching the floor, he paced out into the room on his own, and sat down amongst the others, in silent communion.\n\nI could only repeat, ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù, though the more pressing question that didn‚Äôt occur to me at the time, was *how*?\n\nAfter a deep inhale, Domimokah declared,\n\n‚ÄúGlorious, it is. Today, a person was lost, but a receptor gained, who will one day be accepted by the vast Well, and guide us, in the forthcoming days!‚Äù\n\nI was dumbstruck at how the man in front of me saw joy in whatever the fuck just happened. Still, a false hope grew that we had been subjected to all he intended us to see.\n\n‚ÄúO-okay, that was definitely something‚Ä¶ can we go, now?‚Äù Annie said in a weak and croaky voice.\n\n‚ÄúI implore you, stay. If your thoughts are of pain or worry, dispel them. We have no intent on harming you or your friend here.‚Äù\n\nWith that, the false hope was shattered into a thousand pieces, and we were practically carried by the robotic monks to a room up in the next floor. They shut us inside, and left us. The far side bore the same ornate pillars, though much more closely packed together, so that they more so resembled cell bars than anything.\n\nI waited for a few minutes, then tried to leave. The door wasn‚Äôt locked, but swung open to reveal two of the stone-faced monks, as if they were waiting for me to try it. In perfect synchrony, they stepped forward and shoved me back inside, pulling the door firmly closed once more.\n\nSo, yeah. As of now, we‚Äôre being held against our will in some temple of an indiscernible faith. I said it once and I‚Äôll say it again: thank fuck for the internet. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do if I couldn‚Äôt communicate what we‚Äôre going through right now. I don‚Äôt trust the priest, but I can only hope that he is no liar.\n\nI would say pray for us, but I doubt God‚Äôs grace covers this domain. If I still have the means to update everyone by the end of tomorrow, I‚Äôll be doing just that.\n\n[Good night.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rephlect/comments/11egv7i/theres_a_deceiver_in_the_hills_of_utah_3/)",

        "text": "#Part 1:\n\nNamaste, my fellow Reddit users. I have a experience to tell you, a story that will send shivers down your spine and make you question everything you thought you knew about the paranormal.\n\nYou see, I have always been fascinated by the supernatural, especially the darker side of it. I grew up listening to tales of ghosts, demons, and otherworldly beings from my grandmother, who was a firm believer in the supernatural.\n\nAs I grew older, my curiosity turned into an obsession, and I started exploring abandoned buildings, dark alleys, and cemeteries, searching for signs of the paranormal. I even started watching TV shows and movies about ghost hunting.\n\nBut my obsession soon turned into something more sinister. I became consumed by the idea of communicating with the dead, of crossing over to the other side. I started experimenting with Ouija boards and seances, always seeking that elusive connection with the afterlife.\n\nOne day, I heard about a baba (holy man) who could communicate with the dead and perform miracles. Intrigued, I decided to visit him. The baba lived in a small village, deep in the heart of the forest.\n\nAs I made my way to the village, I felt a strange energy surrounding me. It was as if the forest was alive, and it was trying to warn me of something.\n\nWhen I finally reached the village, I was greeted by the baba, who had a wild look in his eyes. He promised to show me the way to the afterlife, but warned me that the journey was not for the faint-hearted.\n\nHe led me deep into the forest, where we came across an ancient temple. The baba performed a ritual and opened a portal to the other side.\n\nAt first, I was hesitant, but then I saw it - a ghostly figure that floated just above the ground. I was terrified, but also exhilarated. I knew that I had stumbled upon something incredible.\n\nFrom that moment on, I was hooked. I spent every spare moment trying to capture ghosts on film or record their eerie whispers. And I found them, again and again, in the most unexpected places.\n\nBut my obsession soon turned into something darker. I started hearing voices in my head, and I felt a cold hand brush against my cheek. I started seeing things, shadows moving on their own and objects flying across the room.\n\nAnd then, one night, it happened. I made contact with something, something that was not of this world. It spoke to me, in a language that I couldn't understand, and I felt a chill run down my spine.\n\nThat's when I knew that I had gone too far. I had opened a door that I couldn't close, and I was in too deep to turn back now.\n\nBut I couldn't help myself. The thrill of the unknown was too strong, and I needed to know more. I started spending my nights in cemeteries and abandoned houses, trying to provoke the spirits into revealing themselves. I would shout curses and insults into the darkness, hoping to draw out a response.\n\nAnd eventually, it worked. The spirits started speaking to me, but their voices were not comforting or friendly. They were filled with anger and malice, and they demanded that I do their bidding.\n\nAt first, I resisted. I knew that I was in over my head, and I was afraid of what might happen if I gave in. But the spirits were persistent, and they started appearing to me in my dreams. They showed me visions of unspeakable horrors, and promised me power beyond my wildest dreams.\n\nI could feel the darkness closing in around me, but I couldn't stop. I was addicted to the rush, the thrill of the unknown. And then ..............",

        "text": "Darkness falls over a small North American town; no light exists on this moonless night, only shadow. The once thin white clouds from above are now a dark almost black purple and rapidly descending into a thick fog. Wind, shrieking like crazed banshee‚Äôs, roll out of the woods, over the sinister hills that hold shadows of things that only the mind can see, and into the small spaces in between old shutters and underneath the doors of those unlucky enough to not have their ancient homes sealed. This is a night when no one should be outside, yet there is one freckled teenage boy, curled up on a park bench in the center of town. Over the sound of the banshee-like wind is heard the toll of a primeval clock tower striking two. Upon the final toll of the clock the freckled teenage boy stirs and wakes. \n\nOpening his eyes he sees nothing. Sitting up he tries in vain to see into the darkness, but the fog had descended so far into the town‚Äôs labyrinth of alleyways and clearings that one of his five senses was useless. Pulse quickening, the boy immediately lays his hand on the decrepit bench, searching for some sort of familiarity or comfort. Finding none, a feeling of distress overwhelms him. Sticking his hand in his pocket he blindly searches for what he knows is there. Finding the one significant item in his pants pocket he removes it. Flicking off the top of the old lighter he spins the decades old wheel and strikes the flint. Momentary light, then darkness. The wind was too great for the minute flame to stay lit. Closing the aged lighter and clenching it in his hand he becomes aware of movement a ways off to his right. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù this was barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù this time a little louder. Yet there was no response. There, there was the noise again. Lighter still in hand he unconsciously slides his thumb over the front. Carpe Noctem. Seize the night. This is the sole gift from his grandfather that he still owns; because it was his grandfathers it is the boys most cherished belonging. Even with ligher in hand the feeling that there is something out there persists. The hair on the freckled nape of his neck stands on end. \n\nThere, the feeling once again, but this time it was out in front of him, and from the sense he got, whatever it is, it is within an arms reach. Deciding to give it one more try he flips off the top of the lighter and flicks the decade old wheel, light. Upon doing this the howling wind stops and all becomes quiet. With the small light that he has, he could see there was nothing in front of him. Whirling around it becomes apparent that whatever he sensed, whether real or not, was gone. The wind once again picks up, his lighter goes out, and with a gasp the freckled teenage boy is smothered in darkness once again. The fear that now fills him is overwhelming. Every hair is on end. Every fiber in his body is telling him to run. \n\nReaching for his neck he felt his left hand close over the recognizable shape of a cross his mother had given him. Wide eyed and horror stricken he begins to run. Sprinting with all of his heart, mind, and soul he once again has the feeling there is something next to him. Upon realizing this he stops, the fierce banshee-like wind immediately ceases and all is quiet again. He becomes aware of something near him. This time it isn‚Äôt just a feeling, he can distinctly hear the sound of foot steps walking toward him, one slow scraping step at a time. Instinct taking over he becomes dreadfully aware that he needs to see. Pulling out his old lighter he prays to all of the greater beings that his lighter will light. Flicking off the top, spinning the wheel, and igniting the flame. There is light, a great deal brighter than before. \n\nAs the clock tower strikes three he can see that not only is there no primeval clock tower, but there is no ancient town with old homes and aged shutters. I stand alone, in the middle of a field, surrounded by the sounds of a primeval clock tower and of banshee-like wind rolling over the sinister hills that surround him. My lighter goes out, I am alone.",

        "text": "Since the James Webb Space Telescope launched, we have been seeing images unlike anything witnessed before.  These snapshots of space are so clear, showing places so distant, that they reveal the beginnings of galaxies.  Through this tool we can see the past, and the hope is that one day we can observe the beginnings of our universe.  What that might look like could unlock mysteries, and answer questions we haven‚Äôt yet imagined.\n\nBut there has been another startling discovery which the general public has not been made aware of yet.  \n\nWe found something in space which scared the living hell out of me.  \n\nAnd the worst part is, now that I've seen it, there‚Äôs no going back.  \n\n*\n\nThe images coming in from space were beautiful and I was one of the first to have the opportunity to examine them.  I was going over one image recently under intense magnification when I noticed something peculiar.  \n\nIt was a section of space which was unusually dark, lacking any light whatsoever, and some calculations showed that it was headed our way at an alarming rate.  The cause of the light obstruction was within the Milky Way, and we had chalked it up to fine dust particles which absorbed light.  Those would potentially account for the black blob floating towards Earth from the stars, which made no real sense.  \n\nBut when I examined the image more closely, I realized that I could see something in this new image.  Something which our old Hubble Telescope would have been unable to make out.  \n\n‚ÄúNo, it can‚Äôt be‚Ä¶‚Äù I muttered to myself in my home office, where I was looking at the picture.  \n\nIt was late at night and the wind was howling outside as a storm raged on.  It was raining and the occasional clap of thunder was so loud it felt like the house shook with each blast.  The power had flickered off and on once and I was just waiting for it to happen again.  \n  \n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way.  It has to be an artifact.‚Äù\n\nI downloaded a new copy of the image, in case something had been corrupted during the file transfer.  With such large images it was always possible, though extremely unlikely.  \n\nWhen I received the new image I zoomed in on the section once again.  I had saved the coordinates on the picture so I knew exactly where it was.  \n\nOnce again, there was the same distinctive shape, a dark blob swirling among the stars in our galaxy.  But within it were familiar dark shapes resembling worms or millipedes.   \n\nI picked up my cell phone, ignoring the time of night, and phoned another astronomer who had access to these preliminary images.  They hadn‚Äôt been released to the public yet, and were classified and only available to a few of us.  \n\nHe picked up the phone and I was worried he would be annoyed with me calling so late, but he was up looking at the new images as well.  \n\n‚ÄúDo me a favor,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúCheck out image two five four and zoom in close at X1.202-Y5.200 and tell me what you see.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù he answered.  ‚ÄúZooming in on X1.202 and Y5.200 and‚Ä¶  Whoa‚Ä¶  What is that?  An artifact?‚Äù\n\nI let out a deep exhale.  \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not crazy.  You see them too.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt be real.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI wish it wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù\n\n*\n\nThe next day, the two of us set to work, trying to figure out what exactly our theory was before we could try to prove it.  This hypothesis could cost us our careers, even if we were right.  \n\n‚ÄúThose things‚Ä¶  What exactly are we looking at?‚Äù David asked, leaning in close to the giant computer monitor in my home office.  \n\nI let out a sigh.  I was hoping he wouldn‚Äôt make me say it out loud.  \n\n‚ÄúThey look like worms,‚Äù I admitted.  ‚ÄúYou see that too, right?‚Äù\n\nHe nodded reluctantly, but didn't say anything.\n\n‚ÄúThey would have to be huge.  Bigger than stars.  Bigger than solar systems.  Nothing like that exists.  At least, nothing we know of.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúRemember Galactus?  The planet-eater?‚Äù He asked.  I tried to smile but couldn‚Äôt.  \n\n‚ÄúWe need to get another image.  Maybe more than just one.  But first let‚Äôs show Scott what we‚Äôve got here so far.  Let‚Äôs outline the shapes and try to present this as cogently as we can.  Our careers are on the line here.‚Äù\n\nDavid didn‚Äôt sound too enthusiastic.  I knew he was a skeptic and would find a way to explain whatever this was, no matter what.  Still, the two of us set to work, outlining the shapes in the darkness among the stars.  He kept muttering that it was just an artifact, and we were wasting our time.  But I found that not only could I see dark worms, but legs underneath them.  Many, many legs - like enormous, star-eating millipedes.  I shuddered at the thought, recalling the calculations which showed the dark blob was heading toward Earth at alarming speed.  \n\nEventually David went home, and I got the feeling he was starting to think I was crazy.  But if I was wrong, then what was the alternative explanation?  He didn‚Äôt seem to have an answer for that.\n\nThat night I went to sleep and had a terrible nightmare, after staring at the computer screen all day.  \n\nI imagined those dark millipedes squirming and wriggling their way out of my computer monitor.  Their fat bodies dropping on my desk as they began to feast on our world, starting with my home office.  \n\nLike termites, they began to eat my desk, starting with the wooden desktop and then quickly devouring the legs, and moving onto my chair next.\n\nTheir bodies grew fatter as they consumed everything in the room, revealing only darkness behind the facade of my furniture.  And pretty soon it was impossible to distinguish the millipedes from the blackness all around me.  I was floating in space, with no stars.  And the millipedes had run out of food.  \n\nThere was only one thing left to eat.  \n\nMe. \n\nAs they surrounded me on all sides they began to crawl from the darkness onto my fingertips, onto my nose and onto my eyelids, skittering across my skin with their innumerable legs, and finding their way into any opening they could.  \n\nOnce they had eaten my eyes, I was left floating in darkness.  Cold, impenetrable blackness which pressed in on me like a million tons of weight, compressing me, as my body was consumed by a galaxy of worms.\n\nI woke up with a gasp, nearly screaming until I realized an instant later that it was all a dream.  No, not a dream.  A horrible, surreal nightmare.  The worst one I‚Äôd ever experienced in my life.  It felt too real.  \n\nScared to go back to sleep, I got out of bed and went to the kitchen to make coffee.  \n\nThe computer was sitting in the corner, dark and silent.  I wandered over to it and turned it on, inhaling the smell of freshly brewed coffee while I waited for it to boot up.  \n\nOnce I was logged into the server, I pulled up that same image again.  \n\n‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nMy heart skipped a beat as I stared at the screen.  \n\nThe black blob in the image was bigger than before, by almost double.  But it was the same picture, that was impossible.  \n\nI looked through the archive and checked to see if another image had been taken of that same quadrant, but there was nothing.  The telescope had moved on to capturing other images, redirecting its cameras to observe a black hole in a completely different section of space.  \n\nZooming in on the image, I saw the black millipedes even more distinctly now.  \n\nPicking up my cell phone, I called David immediately.  \n\nHe picked up, sounding groggy and annoyed.  \n\n‚ÄúWho is this?  Do you know what time it is?‚Äù he slurred.  \n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me.  Listen, you need to do something for me.  Pull up that image again.  The one with the worms.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúUgh, not this again.  You really need to drop this, man.  I‚Äôm trying to be nice here but this is getting to be too much.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDavid!  You need to listen to me!  You need to look at it again.  It‚Äôs bigger!‚Äù\n\nBut he‚Äôd already hung up on me.  \n\nI realized then that I was on my own, and I‚Äôd have to present this information to the bosses myself.  It would be up to them what they decided to do with it.  \n\n*\n\nUnfortunately, David beat me to the punch.  \n\nBy the time I got to the office, he was already in with Scott, our boss.  They were looking at the image together and David was saying something quietly behind the desk to him when I came in.  \n\n‚ÄúAh, you‚Äôre here,‚Äù Scott said.  ‚ÄúDavid was just showing me what you found.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd?  What do you think it is?‚Äù\n\nThe two of them eyed me up and down, making me feel small.  \n\n‚ÄúYou know this is just an artifact, right?  I mean, it‚Äôs pretty clear.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think they look like‚Ä¶ Worms?  Millipedes?  Trust me, sir, I know how crazy this sounds.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure that you do.  David says he tried to explain this to you, but you‚Äôre not getting it.  We can‚Äôt have analysts on the team who can‚Äôt tell the difference between the plausible and the impossible.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSir?  What does that even mean?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt means you‚Äôre fired.  Your access to the JWST images has been revoked.  From now on you can see whatever we release to the public, just like everybody else.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSir!  Please!  I know how this sounds but you have to believe me!  I‚Äôm a rational person, but those worms are getting bigger!  Just since yesterday, they‚Äôre fatter, and larger, and they‚Äôre eating the fucking stars while we sit here and talk about whether they exist or not.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSee?  This is what I‚Äôm talking about,‚Äù David said.  \n\nHe didn't need to say it, though.  I cringed at how deranged I sounded.  \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling security.  Leave your badge with them.  Feel free to get the hell out of my office, Grimes,‚Äù Scott said, looking back down at the screen again.  \n\nA few minutes later I was out on the street.  No job.  No car - since that was a company lease.  And pretty soon I would have nowhere to live either, since nobody was likely to hire me after my dismissal.  Especially given the reasons why I was let go.  \n\nThis field is a very small one, and word gets around fast.  \n\nAll I had left of my previous life was the image on my computer.  The screenshot I had taken of the ‚Äúwormhole‚Äù as I had come to calling it.  \n\nWhen I pulled it up on my computer again, the dark spot at the center of the image was even more pronounced than before.  I zoomed in on it using the highest level of magnification possible.  \n\nAnd I let out a soft gasp of horror when I noticed something for the first time.  I could actually see the worms moving now, within the image.  I could see them feasting on the glow which surrounded them, consuming the light from nearby stars. Eating planets and entire galaxies with each swift snap of their jaws.  \n\nI closed the image suddenly, my heart jackhammering in my chest.  Suddenly I wanted to get rid of the computer, to throw the whole thing in the dumpster outside.  \n\nBut I knew that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep if I did that.  I knew it would only fester and boil inside of me if I couldn‚Äôt see the progress of those universe-consuming worms.  \n\nAnd so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done.  \n\nEvery day I wake up and look at that image, and stare in horrified wonderment at what is coming for us all.  \n\nI‚Äôm sure my boss must know by now, and David as well.  But they haven‚Äôt reached out to apologize or to say anything to me.  \n\nPart of me wonders‚Ä¶  No, best not to think of those things.  \n\nBut still, part of me wonders if the worms can consume thoughts.  If they are not limited in their ability to digest the universe, but can also consume things more metaphysical than stars.  Can they eat our memories?  Can they make us blind to them?  How else can I be the only one who sees? \n\nMaybe the worms are laughing at me, knowing that only I can see them.  They make others see what they want to see, all the while consuming the stars and growing larger and fatter, getting closer to us by the day.  \n\nI wish that was my biggest concern right now.  I really do.  \n\nIf that were the case I'd still have time.  Years, maybe decades.\n\nBut there‚Äôs a bigger problem.  \n\nI should have thrown out the computer.  \n\nOne day I pulled up the image and the worms had consumed all of it.  They had reached the furthest margins of the massive image, feasting on every star and galaxy along the way.  \n\nI tried to close it quickly, seeing them squirming and wriggling their way across the borders of the image, but it was too late.  \n\nThe fat black millipedes made it across the screen onto my desktop.  Where the corners of the image met my computer monitor, they wriggled over and began to multiply immediately.  \n\nThe main image was closed, but I could still see the worms, feasting on the edges of my desktop screen and clambering over the side of the flat surface.  My desktop background was a serene landscape of green rolling fields with a sunny blue sky dotted with clouds above.  But now it looked infected with a swiftly spreading black plague that multiplied with each passing second. \n\nI screamed, turning off the monitor as quickly as I could, hoping that would get rid of them, hoping they would be limited to existing inside of the flickering screen, but instead they persisted.  \n\nAnd worse yet, I looked down to see one or two were on the finger I‚Äôd used to push the power button.  I tried to wash them off, but they are tenacious and refuse to leave my hand. They spread across my skin and I can feel them taking over.\n\nI can still use my phone with my other hand.  I‚Äôve been debating calling family or friends, to tell them what, I don‚Äôt know.  But instead I‚Äôve chosen to spend my last remaining hours typing this to share with all of you.  Maybe this is all my fault.  Maybe I should have just left well enough alone.  If I hadn‚Äôt looked so closely into the darkness, I might not have seen what truly was lying within it. \n\nBut now that it‚Äôs done, I need to be straight with you all.  You need to know.  You deserve to know, so you can make your peace with loved ones, with family and friends, and those you‚Äôve wronged.  \n\nOnly so much time remains.  \n\nThey‚Äôre here.  The worms that feast on light and leave only darkness in their wake.  They are here.  \n\nAnd they‚Äôre multiplying [quickly.](https://youtu.be/rumiJJyA2FM)\n\n[JG](https://www.reddit.com/r/JGcreepypastas?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n[TCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)",

        "text": " My name is Sara, I live alone in a house in Ohio. I work as a software engineer in a small start up company. This incident happened to me when I moved into my new home near a small suburb . It has been just 3 days since I moved to my new home and I was just settling in with the neighborhood . To give you some context of the house I live in, It is a two store house with a small basement. One night while I was sleeping in my room after a long day of work, I heard some noises coming from upstairs . At first I brushed it off since I was living alone in a big two storey house and the house was not new and it is a common occurrence to hear light rumbling noises as wind passes through the ac vents. \n\n However, after a few more minutes I heard the sound again. This time it was a bit louder. It was like someone was moving a large piece of furniture from one side of the room to the other side. Naturally I woke up since this time the noise was a bit louder. I turned on the lights to the living hall and made my way upstairs.\n\n Once I reached upstairs, I got a bit hesitant to move forward. It was like my gut feeling telling me that something sinister is waiting for me. The darkness of the hallway did not help the situation either. However I was determined to find out about the source of the noise. I proceeded to slowly walk along the dark hallway leading to the master bedroom. As I slightly opened the door, I could see that the chair in the room in a tilted state....like somebody had flipped it upside down which was strange. I went near it and put it in the right position.\n\n Confused and a bit nervous, I did a small inspection of the room and the top floor to see if there was any sign of intrusion or breaking in . Not that I could do much if there was somebody else in the house but a normal check and the feeling of not getting bumbed on¬† by the attacker gave me a small sigh of relief . As I was exiting down the staircase I heard a light thud noise. This time it was like something falling down like a small rubber ball or something like that. However what was strange and kind of terrifying was that the noise came from the master bedroom.\n\n As I slowly turned my head around to see what was making the noise, I truly got chills. The door to the bedroom was wide open, I could see the chair again. However, this time there was someone sitting there... with their head turned around facing the wall. My body just froze for a second.¬† I could literally feel the sweat dropping from my forehead despite the ac working in full capacity. I slowly backed down from the hall way without making any noise and I ran down the stairs and then rushed to my room.¬† I hurriedly got my phone and called 911.¬† While on call with officer, I made sure to exit the house. I didn't feel safe going back to my own house so I stood on the side outside the house till the police arrived.\n\n \n\nonce the cops arrived at my place , they did a thorough check of my house to see if the intruder was still inside or not. After 30 minutes, one of the police officer came to me and said they could not find any one inside. They reassured me to give them a call if any such incidents happen again. I stayed at one of my friend's house that night.\n\nI don't know if what I saw that night was real or not. but I did not stick long enough to find out. A couple of days post that incident, I moved out of the house and to my friend's place. I have since moved to a new apartment.¬† But I still get nightmares of that incident as it still haunts me to this day .\n\n[https://youtu.be/XqJiiDwUCno](https://youtu.be/XqJiiDwUCno)",

        "text": "¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Tristin found it hard to leave everything behind, to move to the Greenhouse. Somehow he found it exciting, imagining his new school, his new town, and the friends he might make. Still, Tristin's heart hung heavy. He left behind everyone he knew. What felt like every memory he had ever made was in that town. Suddenly a flashback of him learning how to ride a bike in the driveway, followed by another when he was around 3, or 4. Mom was trying to explain to him what the moon was one night when he couldn't sleep. Tristin's eyes began to water, but he refused to cry though. He didn't want to upset his parents. \n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \n\nHis dad said, \"we're here, champ.\"\n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Tristin snapped out of it. Getting out of the car and standing in front of The Greenhouse for the first time, an unsettling feeling came over him. The house looked smaller in person. It looked older than in the pictures on the List-A-House Buy-A-House app. Even the green seemed more depressing it was darker and less appealing. Maybe it was bigger inside. NOPE. Now looking over the house with the app open on his phone Tristin could see how they used angles to make everything look bigger. Of course, his parents came and looked at the house in person, which was nice. He figured he just needed time to settle in. \n\n¬†\n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The family had spent the rest of the day moving furniture and unpacking. Tristin thought his room looked like his room, but it didn't feel the same. Tristin flopped down on his bed exhausted mentally, emotionally, and physically. \n\n¬†\n\nHis mom peeked in the door.¬† \"you okay, bud?\" \n\n\"yes, mother.\"¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mom \"Mother? That sounds weird, don't call me that.\"¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"As you wish, mother.\"¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \n\nMom sighs, \"Ok, you goofball, we're gonna hit the hay, we've got an early start tomorrow.\"¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \n\n\"I love you, mom.\"¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \"I love you too honey, goodnight.\"¬† ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬† \"Goodnight.\"\n\n¬†\n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† He had a restless night lying awake with his thoughts. He had seen it right when he started to drift off to sleep. What was it he thought? \n\nA MAN! There's a man in the corner of the room! \n\nTristen jolted to his feet. \"What the f\" ‚Ä¶. \"Where am I?\" He said out loud. Am I dreaming he thought?¬† Everything is so Realistic. It looked to be a post-apocalyptic wasteland, but in black in white. Upon closer inspection Tristin realized no not in black in white, everything is covered in dust or ash. The wind suddenly hit Tristin in the face. It was freezing and smelled of rot and decay. The sky began to clear.\n\nTristin was on a bridge in a small town overlooking a bigger city. The sky was a weird mix of red, purple, and green. He had no idea if the sun was setting or rising.\n\nIn his mind, Tristin already knew he wasn't dreaming. After all, when do you smell things in your dreams, see things vividly, and have cold air? No, this was nothing like a dream he had experienced before. On the other hand, there were no other reasonable explanations. He had to be dreaming. \n\nHad I woken up to the world's end? Am I ... dead ... is this hell?\n\n¬†Tristin wasn't perfect, but the worst thing he had ever done? Getting into a fistfight with Dax Johnson in the 8th grade. Everybody knew Dax deserved it. He had been picking on Tristin since the 5th grade. Dax hit his growth spurt early, and Tristin was an easy target. Nobody expected Tristin to hit his growth spurt over summer vacation, but when he did. Dax was small compared to Tristin. Tristin just ignored Dax, and Dax did the same. One day Tristin saw Dax picking on a 7th grader, and well long story short, everybody learned that day, Tristin was a force to be reckoned with.¬† \n\nTristin snapped back. I gotta be dreaming, he thought. Alright, focus. Wake up, Wake up. \"WAKE UP!\" he screamed. He tried hitting himself, pinching himself. Nothing ‚Ä¶ nothing? NOTHING! What the hell was this? Tristin was infuriated now. What is this? How is this? Where is this? Tristin's thoughts raced. The man in the corner of my room. Did he have something to do with this?\n\nTristin stood on the edge of the bridge. The river bed lay dry below. Tristin thought if I jump I ought to wake up right? Right? Just as Tristin mustered the courage to jump, a beastly voice came from behind. \"I Wouldn't do That.\"¬† Wa-wa-What?¬† Silence‚Ä¶ Okay, I've gone crazy that's it. Complete batshit. Tristin believing that he was hearing voices now readied to jump again. Out came this beastly snarl \"Your funeral kid.\" Tristin now knew he heard a voice. \n\n\"Who's There?\"\n\nBeastly \"You don't deserve to know my name.\"\n\nWhat the actual fuck is that supposed to mean, Tristin thought to himself.¬† \"Okay?... What do I call you?\"¬†¬†¬† More silence \n\n\"Look I don't want to talk to you either. I just want to know, Where I am, or what this place is. How did I get here, or why do you care if I jump?\"\n\nBeastly \"I don't care if you jump, go along little one jump.\"\n\nTristin now more confused than angry began to look around to try and pinpoint where the voice was coming from. \"Then why would you stop me?\" More silence. \n\n\"What happens if I jump, will I die? At least tell me that much!\" \n\nBeastly \"Yes.\"\n\n¬† \"How about Asshole? Yes. I'm Going to call you as-\"¬† Just then Tristin's mouth disappeared. Completely disappeared he couldn't speak. Everything went completely dark. He couldn't see, but he could sense that there was something or someone directly in front of him. He felt like he was suspended in space.¬† You could now feel Beastly's voice rumbling across the land. \"I wouldn't do that.\" Tristen could pick up from how the sound echoed that he was still on the bridge.\"Compared to you, I am a god.\"\n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Tristin hit the bridge's asphalt hard, knocking the wind out of him. Gasping for breath he now realized his mouth was back. \n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cold and terrified Tristin ran to the closest building. once inside, he realized that it was a house. He immediately began scanning the room for anything or anyone. I need to hide he thought. Tristin dashed for the nearest door and flung it open. It was a closet. No no no, I need a weapon. I need to put some space between me and whatever the hell that thing is. Thinking quickly Tristin grabbed an old tattered coat from the closet and put it on. He ran outside and began running as fast as he could away from the bridge. \n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A few blocks away and after a left turn, Tristen was out of breath. His lungs burned. He stopped and sat within an entry archway of an old brick building back against the door. He needed to recoup his energy. \n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Something flew fast over the building. It screeched as it went by. Tristin began pushing himself to his feet and then froze. sitting silent. That wasn't Beastly, no this was something entirely new. A whisper came from behind the door \"don't move\". It flew by again.¬† Just as it completed the pass the door opened and a hand pulled him inside.",

        "text": "I don‚Äôt know where else to turn.  I need your help.\n\nI am a lonely man.  I don‚Äôt get along well with other people and they always seem to misunderstand me.  My family has told me I am too literal and have no sense of humor.  I don‚Äôt agree with the humor part.  But my opinion has never really mattered.\n\nWhen I graduated from college I got a tech job.  It paid well.  I was able to get a moderate apartment in an older building.  I liked it because it was quiet.  Not a lot of loud young people or kids.  I was content to have my own little place, my own job, and my own life.\n\nI just accepted that some people are lonely.  And I was one of those people.\n\nBut then Herman showed up.\n\nIt started small.  Items would be moved around.  Lights would turn on or off.  I‚Äôd find a specific sweater set out on the bed that I didn‚Äôt remember putting there, but that perfectly fit the weather.  I chalked it up to me being forgetful.  That‚Äôs what made sense, right?\n\nThe biggest thing that should have clued me in was that every morning, like clockwork, my favorite mug would appear on the counter with a teabag in it.  The mug was clean and the teabag was different each day.  Earl Grey, Irish Breakfast, Jasmine, or Orange Blossom.  My four favorites.  I couldn‚Äôt have put out the mug.  I was asleep.  It had to have been someone else.   \n\nI didn‚Äôt believe in ghosts at the time.  Supernatural stuff seemed ridiculous.  I was a fan of logic and facts.  If there was no evidence, then it might as well have not existed.  But seeing that mug every morning made me feel something I couldn‚Äôt explain.\n\nThis went on for months.  I didn‚Äôt tell anyone.  Who could I have told?  I was alone.\n\nBut I wasn‚Äôt really alone.\n\nI remember first seeing him sitting on the couch, one of my books open on his lap.  He looked like a man slightly older than me, dressed in suspenders.  He might have looked alive if he wasn‚Äôt see-through.  Why was a transparent man in my apartment?  And why was he reading an outdated coding manual?\n\nI was stuck in place, terrified.  Ghosts didn‚Äôt exist.  Couldn‚Äôt exist.  It made no sense.  But here he was, soft features clearly visible.  I put a hand on my chest, my heart pounding against my palm.\n\nHe looked at me.  His expression was sad.  Something bigger than fear began to fill my chest.  I was a lonely person.  And this man, this ghost, was the same.  He patted the cushion next to him and nodded his head.  \n\nIt was a nod of understanding.\n\nI hesitated.  But there was something about him that appealed to me.  Maybe it was the way his transparent pants were a little too short for his long transparent legs.  Or maybe it was the soft curl of hair that just brushed his cheek.\n\nSlowly I walked towards him, ready to run if I felt threatened.  But nothing happened.  He just looked back at the book.  I sat next to him, nervous.  He pointed at a page.  It was a diagram of a computer.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the motherboard,‚Äù I said softly, kind of embarrassed at the situation.\n\nI figured I was probably going crazy.  But I leaned into it.  I was talking to a ghost.  \n\nHe pointed at something else and looked to me, a slight smile lighting up his face.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the disc drive.  A lot of laptops don‚Äôt have that anymore.  This book is pretty old.‚Äù\n\nHe turned the book over to look at the date.  He pointed at it and cocked his head.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 2018 now.‚Äù I responded.\n\nHe looked sad again.  \n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù  It was a foolish question.  But this was the most contact I had with a person in a long time.  \n\nHe pointed at his mouth and shook his head.  \n\n‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt talk?‚Äù\n\nHe nodded. \n\n‚ÄúCan you write it down?‚Äù\n\nHe rose from the couch.  Instead of walking, he hovered above the floor about five inches.  Without me telling him where to find it, he went to my desk and selected a pen and paper.  He knew exactly where it was.  How long had he been here?  Did he know everything about my apartment?\n\nHe scribbled on the paper and held it up to me.  It said, ‚ÄúHerman.‚Äù  \n\nI liked the name.  I smiled.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Gil.‚Äù\n\nHe smiled back.\n\nI called in sick that day (for the first time in my life) and spent hours with Herman.  I told him about my life.  He was a good listener.  I asked him about himself as well, but he could only respond with a few words.  He knew he was dead.  He died in the apartment in the 1930‚Äôs and couldn‚Äôt leave.  He said he lost track of time a lot.  He smiled with his eyes.\n\nSometimes during the day he would fade and need time to come back to his form.  I didn‚Äôt mind.  I would listen to music or read while he rested.  It was nice to have him there.  \n\nI wasn‚Äôt used to company.  But I could get used to living with Herman.\n\nAnd so began my new life.  I went to work, counting the hours until I could come home and be with him.  When he laughed, I swear I almost heard it.  When he grinned I felt a warmth in my chest.  When I went to sleep, he would hover next to me on the bed, his translucent arm almost touching mine.  It was heaven.  Five years flew by with him.  \n\nAnd of course, like clockwork, every morning he would set out my mug with a teabag.  \n\nUntil yesterday.  Yesterday, Herman was gone.\n\nHe wasn‚Äôt allowed to leave the apartment.  It wasn‚Äôt my rule, it was a rule he had learned through living there for decades.  He sometimes faded, sure, but he was never absent.  I woke up yesterday and went about my typical routine.  I called out to him a few times, wondering if he got distracted by taking care of the plants or reading one of the new books I brought home for him.  But he never responded.  I scoured the house.\n\nAs I did, I realized that there was no mug on the kitchen counter.  No teabag deliberately picked out for me.  \n\nAnd that‚Äôs when I knew something bad had happened.\n\nI have to find him.  Please, if you know anything, reach out to me.  I will try anything.  I won‚Äôt just let him slip away.  I can‚Äôt.  [I would do anything to bring him back.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EZmisery/)",

        "text": " I am sure many of you are familiar with the concept of closed cities, particularly as part of the Soviet Union or to some extent even current Russia. But for those who are not, they are (as a quick Wikipedia search would also tell you or as their name quite explicitly suggests) cities, that hold a particular statute because of their strategic importance, which can stem from various resources such as uranium and nuclear power or production of different goods like weaponry and heavy machinery. Logically, there is a need to protect these cities mainly from foreign threats (or from secrets getting out). Therefore, these cities hold a particular statute and there is restricted access to them and in most cases, for those inside, restricted access outside. \n\nEven if you have heard about these places, I am sure that you are most likely not aware that some existed also outside of Soviet Russia, or at least mine did (it was still in a communist country though). It is, however, not the only special thing about my city. What was also special about my former home (for merely 10 years preceding the fall of the Berlin Wall) is the fact that almost nobody knew that it existed and the majority of the people that did, were not aware of its precise location, including my humble self. Again logically, this city was shut down after the iron curtain was lifted, but as far as I know, it is still standing not so tall hidden somewhere within the Carpathian mountains. \n\nBy now, if you have at least a tiny bit of curiosity encoded within your fragile DNA, you must be asking, what was the purpose of this city and what was the writer of this story doing there? Well, I will tell you at least a fraction of it before I join the great majority (or simply put, die). So quite likely this will be a series, but there is a small probability that it will not be so. \n\nI will not prolong this any longer and just get to it straight. The purpose of our facility was to create an obedient nation. You see, in the seventies, the supreme leaders were well aware that even with their greatest attempts at social engineering there will still be a rebellious spark among their people making them thirsty for freedom, democracy and capitalism. So in desperation, they turned to a different kind of engineering (calling it this way for metaphorical reasons, what we did was sometimes related to engineering, other times less so). Our goal was to basically create a citizen that wakes up, goes to work where they do not necessarily need to be that productive, comes home, eats some potatoes with cabbage and perhaps some meat from a can, watches the national television, on special occasions joins a parade to celebrate the regime, before Christmas stands in the queue for oranges and is content doing all that. \n\nAs I already suggested, we experimented with a lot of different means to achieve the set goal. This required the involvement of a significant amount of experts ranging from various kinds of biologists, and chemists to, believe it or not, historians and mythologists. Being a neuroscientist, I could consider myself one of the few lucky people that got to participate in most of the experiments. The reason for this universal need for my expertise is simple. Whatever we did, the most important outcome was the impact on the nervous system of the subjects and subsequently on their behavior. You may have deduced that we experimented also on human subjects (all dissidents of the regime), but most of our work did not reach the level of human trials. However, this story is not about the horrors that those people experienced. This is a story about three of our experiments that got horribly wrong and frightened me to my core. Also, these stories will go from the least frightening one to the most frightening one at least from my subjective point of view. Just because I like building up expectations. \n\nSo, the first of these three experiments (which certainly is no surprise for at least some of you) concerned parasites. Our amazing parasitologists and geneticists managed to take the best of a lot of worlds and put together a behavior-altering parasite (out of other parasites usually preying on various animals, mainly insects) creating a new species that was supposedly fit to help us achieve our goal on humans. Please, don‚Äôt ask me how they managed to do that. Either way, this project got to an advanced stage, and therefore, I was brought to observe the brain activity of our human subjects and everything looked absolutely perfect. Well, until it didn‚Äôt. \n\nBecause of my detailed notes, I know it was a stereotypical summer day that some people may call beautiful and we thought we were lucky because it was supposed to be the first day of our field trials. Our chosen subject was a woman, and if I may express some pure subjectivity, an absolutely beautiful woman. She had the kind of fair skin and soft features typical for a lot of Slavic women. But especially those eyes I will never forget, green, just like the thick forests encompassing our city. However, it was not important as at that point there was not a single original (or perhaps even autonomous) thought behind them. She was perfect. \n\nWe took her (the subject) out to the city, which despite being closed, could still perfectly provide the semblance of real life. From the start, everything went well. She was not interested in anything outside the formal schedule that we presented her with a schedule which was identical to the daily routine of the ideal citizen. She followed it to the latter and did not interact with anyone outside the small talk about the beautiful weather. \n\nIt all went wrong when we walked past an artificial lake serving as the water reserve for our facility. After we got close to the water, the subject started sprinting towards it. A few members of our team, including the lead scientist on the project, Mrs. Horvath, went immediately after her. I, on the other hand, was doing my job and observed her behavior from a safe distance. When they tried to pull the subject out, she became very aggressive, or if I dare say, almost ferocious and managed to free herself while slightly wounding Mrs. Horvath. Afterwards, the subject swam away with an Olympic athlete speed only for her body to be washed up dead and cold a while later. \n\nLater I learned that her dead body contained no more parasites. At that time, I assumed that Mrs. Horvath would look into that as it was her job, but apparently she did not do so and there is a simple explanation of why I know that. Just a few days after this incident, our entire staff except me and Mrs. Horvath met the same fate as the subject as apparently the parasites managed to get into the facility‚Äôs drinking water. Those that saw it happening said it was a maddening scene. I am somewhat morbidly sad that I did not get the chance to witness it as it certainly falls under the category of frightening, yet intriguing human behavior. I also acknowledge my luck of having an unhealthy obsession with imported sweet (having access to them was one of the conditions of me working at the facility) drinks at the time. \n\nUnfortunately for Mrs. Horvath, she was not as lucky, the parasites were transmitted to her already when she was wounded by the subject. She somehow managed to block the suicidal tendencies, but while focusing on saving her own life, she became indirectly responsible for deaths of dozens of others. However, it was no use to her as she was executed some weeks later in front of our new staff to serve as an example of possible consequences of doing a bad job.",

        "text": "  \n\nIt started in autumn last year. \n\nAfter our student flatshare was dissolved, I moved my furniture into another room in my parents' house than what had been my children's room. My new room was now on the ground floor instead of the first. But it was not used often, as I now had a flat where I live with my boyfriend. Nevertheless, every few weeks, about once a month or so, I visited my parents and slept in said room.\n\nOne cool autumn night, I was woken up by a soft knock. It sounded like someone knocking on wood. At first I heard it only very softly and irregularly, but I could make out that it must be coming from the direction of the window. At that time, I didn't think anything of it, it was probably just our neighbour, a gifted tinkerer, once again assembling something.\n\nOn my next visit, I was awakened by these knocking noises again. This time it was louder and more regular. It would be a strange coincidence if our neighbour was again the source of the knocking. I listened a little closer and concluded that the noise must be coming from our garden. Sleepily I got up and went to the window, opened the blinds and risked a look outside. No one was there, the knocking had stopped. Maybe it was a woodpecker that had been startled by the sound of the blinds and had fled. Or I had only imagined the noise anyway, I thought to myself as I lay back in my warm bed.\n\nThe next morning, while having breakfast with my parents, I asked them if they had also heard that knocking last night. They both replied in the negative, which confirmed my assumption that I had only imagined the noise.\n\nThe next time, the knocking had become louder again. I tried to ignore it, but when I couldn't fall asleep even after what felt like an eternity, I decided to check again, hoping this time to find the source of the noise. So I got up again, opened the blinds and froze for a second: the knocking had stopped like last night, but this time I saw a black silhouette standing by our fence. It stayed there for a few seconds, seemed to be watching me and then disappeared into the corn field that bordered our property. I don't think I need to mention that I didn't sleep a wink that night.\n\nOver dinner, I asked my friend what he thought of my story. He said it was probably just my imagination and that the stress also contributed to it. It was true, I was really stressed at the moment, but was that why my mind was playing such tricks on me?\n\nSome time passed before I stayed overnight with my parents again. Partly because of the above-mentioned incident. After my evening routine, I went to bed and tried to sleep, still thinking of the dark silhouette. When I woke up, the first rays of sunlight were already greeting me through the gaps in the blinds. Apparently, the events of the last few times had indeed been imaginary. \n\nRelieved, I got up and looked forward to my breakfast after this restful night. On my way to the kitchen, I glanced around the garden. My name had been carved into the tree. I rubbed my eyes, somewhere inside me still slumbered the hope that I was imagining it. All at once, my joy after the quiet night was gone. The writing was still there. I called my parents to me. After they were finally at the window and I had prepared them for the sight, I myself turned my gaze back outside. The writing had disappeared.\n\nSince it was a long weekend, I decided to spend another night here. Against all expectations, I was able to fall asleep quickly. This night the knocking had returned. It was again louder than last time, but the frequency was lower and the sound was different. This time it wasn't wood, it almost sounded like... glass? I went to the window and opened the blinds, hoping that this would stop the knocking again. A mistake, as I then realised. In one leap I was back in my bed and pulled the covers over my head. There clearly was a face right at the window! I couldn't see all the details, I had hidden myself too quickly. But the... thing, it didn't stop knocking on the windowpane. After a few minutes, which seemed like hours, I pulled the blanket off my head and dared to look towards the window. The knocking had stopped, but the face was still there. Because of the darkness, I couldn't make out much, except its deep black eyes with red pupils and his broad grin, which revealed his long pointed teeth. But as abruptly as the knocking had stopped, the face disappeared. During that sleepless night, I vowed never to sleep over at my parents' house again, at least not for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis all happened a few weeks ago. I'm writing this story down because last night I heard that knocking once more. It was on glass again, I suspect it was the balcony door. My boyfriend couldn't hear it when I woke him up. But this morning we found fingerprints on our balcony door that weren't there yesterday. Outside. On the seventh floor. Anyway, my boyfriend believes me now. But neither he nor I can imagine what this creature wants from me. I don't know how much time I have left. I don't know where I'll be safe from the creature. If there is a safe place anywhere at all.\n\n\\---------------------\n\nEDIT: My girlfriend asked me to let her write this post on my account (she doesn‚Äôt have one of herself) and I only found the time to read it today. She has been missing for two days now. I should have just believed her from the beginning. But even if I did, was there something we could have done to prevent the creature from getting her? Maybe there is someone here, who experienced something similar and got away. I won't give up hope until I find her again.",

        "text": "I had spent a loving six weeks with my baby boy Jasper before I received the letter in the mail. It came in a fancy light blue sealed envelope, with the simple words ‚Äúnew mom‚Äù. It didn‚Äôt display my address nor a return address. ‚ÄúHuh, weird?‚Äù I thought to myself, ‚Äúmust be from one of my neighbours‚Äù. I opened the letter to reveal an invitation to a free trip for new mom and baby. The letter described that a research company, FetaTech, has been interested in studying the effects of time zone changes, on maternal/baby sleep cycles. In order to make volunteers more enticed,  a free vacation to an ‚Äòisland getaway‚Äô was offered. The letter continued to state that during this vacation is when the research would be conducted. A phone number was provided to call to receive more information. \n\nMy initial reaction was to throw away the letter. It wasn‚Äôt uncommon to receive spam mail that ended up being a scam or something along those lines of: ‚Äúcome on this free trip, once purchasing this overpriced/unnecessary item!!!‚Äù. However, something intrigued me to look into it further. A quick google search yielded no results. I decided to call my girlfriend who had had a baby a few months prior to myself, to see if she had received something similar. ‚ÄúYeah, I got the same letter! Weird there was no address, but I called the number and it sounds legit‚Äù Jen said, ‚ÄúLittle Luke and I plan to attend, because if you‚Äôre as tired as I am, getting away somewhere sounds amazing. Even if it‚Äôs with the baby!‚Äù. I told her I would think about it and get back to her, she was right though, travelling away from home for a bit would be nice. Although I love Jasper, getting out of this house would be a good change of scenery. \n\nWhen my husband returned home from work, I showed him the letter. He looked over it with skepticism, but seeing how tired I was from taking care of Jasper, he softened a little. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre tired hun, but this letter is just a little sketchy‚Äù Oliver stated, ‚ÄúI can take you on a trip with the baby in a few months! Just give me time to save‚Äù.  Oliver wasn‚Äôt wrong that the letter came at random, but I pushed harder, ‚ÄúJen called the number and she said it sounds legit! Please Oliver, I‚Äôve thought this over all day and I‚Äôd really like to attend. It would be nice to be in a place where people understand the great, yet overwhelming experience of becoming a new mom‚Äù I pleaded. Oliver looked hard over the letter again, and with a sigh told me to call the number. \n\nThe next day I called, and Jen was right, it did sound legitimate. No purchase necessary. I provided my address and they would send the plane tickets in the mail in two weeks time, and we would fly out two days after. A private island off the coast of Mexico owned by the company, would be our destination; I could hardly wait and began packing that night. \n\nTwo weeks dragged on before I received the plane tickets. Jen and I had gone shopping to purchase some new outfits for ourselves and babe. ‚ÄúMexico, I am SO excited‚Äù exclaimed Jen. I agreed with her, I had never been to Mexico before and felt this was a much deserved reward for carrying my little munchkin for nine months. Jen and I carpooled to the airport two days later; a sea of moms and babies met us with a deafening roar. ‚ÄúWow, they really wanted to fill this plane,‚Äù I thought. While Jen and I waited for the flight, we met a few other mom‚Äôs and began to socialize. \n\nOnce we boarded our flight, a woman in a light blue pant suit greeted us at the front of the plane, ‚ÄúWelcome new moms, and thank you for the sacrifices you have made to become a Mother. I am Denaida, and will be hosting this trip on behalf of FetaTech. Please, if you have any questions or concerns, don‚Äôt hesitate to come talk to me‚Äù. The plane took off, while Jen and I chatted away about what we would do on our trip. ‚ÄúWhen I phoned, they said they had a daycare so we could spend some time away‚Äù Jen said ‚ÄúWe are definitely having drinks if that‚Äôs the case‚Äù. I laughed, it had been so long since I had had any alcohol. \n\nThe flight went by quicker than anticipated and we finally arrived at our destination. We were greeted right off the plane with a line of staff all dressed in light blue. Each member helped us to unload our babies and without hesitation began wheeling them towards the resort before I even had a chance to grab my luggage. ‚ÄúUhm, what are you doing?‚Äù I said rather panicked to one of the staff rolling Jasper away. ‚ÄúWe take the babies to your room, so you can grab your luggage‚Äù they exclaimed. ‚ÄúOh‚Äù is all I managed to get out, tucking the mama bear instinct away. \n\nThe resort sat right on the beach, with a view of the ocean that seemed to expand on forever. The rooms were quaint but perfect and once we were settled, Jen and I put the babies down for a nap and finally sat down. As we were taking a moment to enjoy the beauty of the island, a knock on the door snapped us out of our trance, Jen answered. ‚ÄúTwo drinks for two lovely ladies‚Äù as a staff member held two champagne glasses filled with a blue liquid, ‚Äúan island special. Dinner will be served promptly at 7pm‚Äù. Jen grabbed the two glasses and brought one over to me. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to us!‚Äù As we clinked glasses; the drink had a fruity flavour, that went down a little too easy. \n\nDinner time came, as Jen and I prepared our boys to join us. A staff member, Phoebe, saw us carrying Jasper and Luke, ‚Äúoh ladies, tonight is your night off. We have a nursery to put the babies in while you two enjoy your evening. It‚Äôs right this way!‚Äù.  Phoebe led us to a room filled with bassinets, toys, and all the necessities. A group of women in light blue outfits greeted us. All of them appeared tired, with dark bags under their eyes. ‚ÄúThese ladies will take excellent care of your children while you enjoy dinner! Here is the childcare itinerary for your viewing‚Äù stated phoebe, which included story time, sensory play and finally an evening beach walk for the children. ‚ÄúExcuse me a moment, I see some other ladies looking for the nursery‚Äù as Phoebe walked back to the dinner hall to greet them. \n\nOne of the nursery employees approached us, ‚ÄúBella‚Äù she introduced herself. She looked worried, her eyes darting back and forth to the door and back to us. She looked at both Jen and I, and stated one simple word ‚Äúrun‚Äù. Confused by this, I asked her ‚Äúwhat do you mean?‚Äù. Bella began whispering fast in Spanish, before Phoebe entered the room again. ‚ÄúOh Bella, she‚Äôs our newest employee here. English isn‚Äôt her first language! She tries out new words and phrases with all our guests to better her English. Right, Bella?‚Äù Bella looked down at her shoes, and wouldn‚Äôt meet Phoebes gaze. Bella carried both Luke and Jasper away. ‚ÄúCome along ladies, dinner is about to begin!‚Äù. I began feeling unsure about leaving, but Jen quickly reassured me that we are not far away if we need to see our little ones. This put my mind at ease, and we walked back to the dining hall. \n\nDinner was served in a twelve course style; each plate was decorated beautifully and absolutely delicious. The same island drink was served to us, until the last course. A spectacular orange drink, decorated with flowers and fruit was apart of our last plate. While reaching for her own, Jen knocked my drink all over my lap. ‚ÄúI am so sorry!‚Äù Jen said, as I excused myself back to our room to change. I was stopped at the door by two employees, ‚Äúsorry ma‚Äôam, you cannot leave until you have finished dinner.‚Äù I explained my predicament, and both employees looked at each other, ‚Äúdid you at least get to enjoy the last drink?‚Äù One employee exclaimed. ‚ÄúOh yes, it was wonderful‚Äù I lied, not wanting to offend them. ‚ÄúOkay, well be quick, we have a special show after dinner for all our guests!‚Äù.\n\nAfter cleaning up, I stopped by the nursery to check in on Jasper. Upon entering the room, I noticed it was empty. ‚ÄúHuh, they must have already started the walk‚Äù I thought. I quickly changed and returned to the dining room. I sat back down beside Jen, ‚ÄúHope I didn‚Äôt miss anything‚Äù I said, but Jen just stared forward, appearing miles away. Too much to drink I guess, ‚ÄúJen? You okay?‚Äù As I placed my hand on her arm. Her skin was cold and clammy to the touch. Jen slowly turned to me ‚ÄúSorry, the person you have spoken to is unavailable‚Äù she said in a monotone voice. ‚ÄúWow Jen, you really can‚Äôt handle your alcohol‚Äù I exclaimed with a slight chuckle. But as I began to peer around the room, I noticed each mom had the same expressionless face. \n\n‚ÄúThank you ladies, for your wonderful sacrifice‚Äù a booming voice said. My head snapped to the center stage, Denaida had begun to address the group. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know how special our project is, and because of you and your babies, we will finally be able to conduct our research‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome, Denaida‚Äù each mom chimed in unison. ‚ÄúJust wait and see what we have for all of you, today we begin to rewrite history‚Äù Denaida exclaimed. The pit in my stomach grew and grew until I couldn‚Äôt sit still anymore, I felt sick. A cold sweat broke out over my entire body and my brain began to scream ‚Äúleave while you can‚Äù. \n\nWhile Denaida rambled on, I planned my escape. I looked around the room for an empty exit, but each door was guarded by an employee in light blue. I continued to scan the room until I saw an open window behind one of the tables of women. I slowly slunk down my chair unnoticed and began to crawl towards it. As I was about to climb out I looked up and noticed the entire table was looking at me, their faces stretched into a horrific expression. Each woman began to point at me and scream. This drew attention from the employees who began to charge in my direction. I quickly slipped through the window and landed in the sand. I looked behind me and watched as the other employees began to follow me through the window. Alarms all around the resort began blaring. I ran as fast as I could, the only thing on my mind was finding little Jasper. \n\nI managed to give the employees following me the slip by hiding in a large patch of seaweed I found along the beach. My heart pounded as their flashlights scoured the beach. Once they passed and I felt confident they would not see me, I snuck around the resort building to find a way back in. ‚ÄúWhere could Jasper be?‚Äù As panic began to truly set in. As I was exploring, I saw a large white building separate from the resort we were staying in. I could hear the screams of several babies coming from it, and began to run towards it. What if that was Jaspers cry? \n\nAs I walked around the building looking for the entrance, I peered through the building window. Every baby that was brought to the island lay in this large building. Rows upon rows of bassinets separated the infants. People in white lab coats went from baby to baby, injecting them with a similar looking orange liquid that we were served with dinner. I frantically scanned the babies and noticed Jasper near the back. It appeared as though the people in white lab coats had not made it to him yet. \n\nDesperate to get into the building, I looked around for anything that could get me inside. I settled on a rock to smash the window, it was a risky chance but fear and adrenaline began to cloud my mind. I was about to smack the window when I noticed Bella, the original employee who had told me to run. As she walked by the window I lightly tapped on it hoping to get her attention. Her solemn gaze met mine and suddenly she lit up. She pointed to a door near the back of the building and swiftly walked there to meet me. As I approached the door, she opened it a crack. ‚ÄúPlease, Bella, please I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with this island. I just want my baby back‚Äù hot tears began to roll down my cheeks. ‚ÄúBaby name?‚Äù she stated, ‚ÄúJasper‚Äù I sobbed. Bella calmly walked over to where Jasper was laying and began to pick him up. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù another employee in blue demanded. ‚ÄúChange, baby needs to be changed‚Äù I heard her say. The other employee watched her sternly before walking off to the other babies. \n\nOnce the other employee was distracted, Bella brought over Jasper and handed me him, ‚ÄúBoat‚Äù is all she managed to say to me. She pointed over to the pier, ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù I said, ‚Äúyou have no idea what you have done for me‚Äù. Bella smiled a sad smile before gently closing the door. \n\nI did my best to sneak over to the pier, unseen by the other employees. Large search lights lit up the island in a sterile white glow. Jasper was nuzzled into my chest fast asleep as I searched the pier for a boat. I found a small row boat hidden under a black tarp. As I lowered myself into the boat, I stepped on something that crinkled beneath my foot. I realized it was a set of instructions, a flare and a small compass, it read as follows:\n\n1. Row boat to nearest buoy, about half a kilometre north. \n2. Once at the buoy, light the flare provided and help will come. \n\nI did as instructed and began rowing, Jasper remained asleep the duration of the trip to the buoy. Once there I lit the flare and waited. It felt like an eternity before another boat appeared in the distance, I prepared myself for the worst as I wiped my clammy hands on my pants. A young man pulled up beside me, he had a striking resemblance of Bella. I realized quickly this must be her son, as he helped Jasper and I onto the boat and tied off the row boat to the buoy. He introduced himself as Sam, and as I had thought, he was Bella‚Äôs youngest son. \n\nAs we made it back to the mainland of Mexico I learned  that Bella had been helping people escape the island for the last couple of months with help from her son. ‚ÄúEven if she can save just one, that‚Äôs why she stays there. To try to warn and help‚Äù Sam explained. I also learned about FetaTech and their actual intentions with us and our children. FetaTech was never interested in learning how our sleep cycles were affected by the time change, but rather how to override maternal/infant instinct and control the hosts conscious state. The orange drinks provided had the FetaTech virus-based serum and once ingested, began to act upon its host almost immediately. As the company realized that their product had worked, the next step was to test it out on the mother‚Äôs offspring which happened to still be in their infancy. Through this, they wanted to learn if they could alter the attachment between both mom and baby. ‚ÄúWhat do they gain from this?‚Äù I asked Sam, still confused. ‚ÄúMind control, if you will. They want people who are unattached to the things that mean the most to them. Less attachment equals easier to control. In this case, the bond between mother and child is so strong, that if they were able to alter that, it meant controlling and weaponizing the primitive nature of humans‚Äù. \n\nI sat there stunned, unable to comprehend what had just happened. It was nearing dawn, and we had almost made it to the mainland. I watched as Jaspers chest rose and fell as he slept. I had saved my baby and escaped that dreadful place. My heart became heavy as I imagined Jen and Luke still there. Once I was home, I would contact the proper authorities. Sam helped me acquire a plane ticket home, and I thanked him again. I told him to thank Bella as well, she truly saved my family. \n\nOnce we landed back home, I decided to take a taxi home in order to prevent Oliver from having a panic attack. He had already had reservations about my trip, and would worry as to why I was home after only 2 days spent away. I wanted time to prepare what I had to tell him, and to compose myself after such an experience. \n\nAs the taxi pulled into our driveway, I breathed a sigh of relief. With my hands still shaking, I fumbled to knock on our front door. The door pushed open, appearing to never be locked in the first place. Oliver made no reaction to the sound of the door opening and sat on the couch watching TV as I approached him. He often listened to it so loud, I wasn‚Äôt surprised when we didn‚Äôt hear me. ‚ÄúOliver we are home, and we need to discuss something‚Äù I said. Oliver gave me no reaction, ‚ÄúOliver?‚Äù I said again. He slowly turned his head towards me with that same look in his eyes as Jen had at dinner ‚ÄúSorry, the person you have spoken to is unavailable‚Äù he said in a dull tone. I began backing away in horror as he stared into nothing.\n\nI grabbed Jasper and ran, fumbling with the car keys and dropping them in the process. Oliver began to get up from the couch, as I stared in horror. Jaspers wails brought me out of my frozen state. I grabbed the car keys, and put Jasper in his car seat, buckling him up faster than I ever have before. \n\nI drove and drove until I was too exhausted to see, finding a motel off the main drag. I‚Äôm currently typing this on my cell phone in our motel room; if I don‚Äôt provide an update, please know I didn‚Äôt make it. Please spread this story to prevent other moms from making my mistakes. \n\nI‚Äôm so sorry Oliver, I love you.",

        "text": "*‚ÄúPride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.‚Äù*\n\nThat‚Äôs how the quote goes, but for me, my greed led to my destruction. In 1748, I along with my family and other members of my village fell ill to a plague. I knew I was bound to die like the others in my village. It was then that a strange man visited me, and he offered me a gift.\n\nA gift no one in my predicament could refuse; immortality. I was delirious from the plague and agreed to his terms without even listening to him. I didn‚Äôt want to die and the thought of immortality sparked a feeling of greed within me. As soon as I agreed to his terms, he vanished into thin air. I had almost thought I hallucinated the whole incident, but my rapidly improving condition proved it actually happened.\n\nNeedless to say, I was gleeful of it and went to see my family. My joy lasted for a short while until I realized this gift was in fact a curse. I watched my family die one by one; each suffering in their last moments. I watched as they each suffered, not being able to do a thing. No matter how much I prayed, that strange man did not return. \n\nThe last of my family to go was my baby sister, who I held in my arms as she breathed her last breath. I wept for days and wandered around the village not bothering to eat or drink. What was the use? I couldn‚Äôt die, so what was the point? I would call out to the strange man to come and retract his ‚Äògift‚Äô but nothing worked. \n\nIt wasn‚Äôt long before the survivors of the plague grew suspicious of me. They wanted to burn me at the stake even though the witch hunts from years prior had calmed down. This prompted me to leave the village and travel. I traveled to multiple places until I settled down in a small town. I tried to enjoy my life there as much as I could, and I did find some peace of mind.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt long before I met the person who soon became the love of my life. She was as beautiful as a flower and as gentle as the sunlight. Despite the curse of immortality, I found myself falling for her charm. After weeks of getting to know each other, we were together. Like a fool, I placed my immortality to the back of my mind.\n\nMonths after we were together, we were engaged and planning to be married. Twas the night before our wedding day that I was jolted from the paradise I foolishly placed myself in. I received word from my lover‚Äôs brother that she had suddenly come down sick. I rushed to their home and to her bedside. I held her hand as the village physician checked her worsening condition. His face was grim as he told us the dreadful news.\n\nHer family and I wept at her bedside. I held her hand tightly as I constantly told her how much I loved her and what she meant to me. With a hoarse voice, she whispered words of endearment to me before she passed. The cause of her illness was unknown but I just knew it was because of me. That suspicion was confirmed when I looked up and spotted that same strange man standing on the other side of her bed. \n\nI fell back in shock; startling her family. My shock soon turned to rage as I belittled him and asked what he wanted from me. Her family looked at me as if I was crazy, but I didn‚Äôt care.\n\nThe man stared at me before responding, *‚ÄúYou should have listened to my terms.‚Äù*\n\nThis put the fire in my heart out as I was dragged out of the room. I was thrown out and told to get my head together. Apparently, they couldn‚Äôt see the strange man. Once again, I wandered around the town and into the woods, wishing more than ever to die. I barely had the energy to lift my feet from the ground and tripped on a tree root. \n\nI fell and laid there for what seemed like hours. I heard a sinister laughter and looked up to see that man again. I didn‚Äôt even have the energy to yell and curse him, I just felt hollow.\n\n‚ÄúCan you take your ‚Äògift‚Äô back?‚Äù I asked instead.\n\nHe laughed, *‚ÄúOnce the gift has been given, it can‚Äôt be returned. You should have listened to my conditions before agreeing.‚Äù*\n\nI cursed myself, ‚ÄúCan you at least tell me what the conditions were?‚Äù\n\n*‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see the harm in that, so I might as well. There were three conditions. The first of the three provided you with a perfect memory, making you unable to forget a single thing. The second of the three; if you are to receive a fatal injury to mortals you will die momentarily and experience that pain ten-fold. And finally the third condition, anyone you love will die.‚Äù* he responded after much contemplation.\n\nI pulled myself up to my knees as my stomach twisted. I felt sick just listening to the conditions. I couldn‚Äôt even get mad at him because it was my own fault this has happened. He vanished into thin air once more leaving me to my own devices. I curled up as small as I could as sobs racked my body.\n\nAfter this, I moved from place to place, never staying for long. I kept my distance from people as much as I could, fearing that I might bring about their death as well. I continued like this until 1823. In 1823, I experienced the second of the three conditions. I was roaming the woods somewhat close to a town, but I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to it. I had just passed behind a large tree when I was struck in the neck by a bullet. \n\nIt shattered my esophagus and blood gushed from my neck. I grabbed at my neck to stop the bleeding, but it was too late. I went unconscious and continuously experienced that pain ten-fold. It was like my very own personal hell. It was then that I developed a fear of death even though I couldn‚Äôt die. \n\nI wasn‚Äôt sure how much time had passed when I regained consciousness, but the sun was rising once more. The last I remember before I fell unconscious is that it was midday. My neck ached as I remembered the pain and I immediately grabbed it. Thankfully, everything was healed up as if nothing happened, but I couldn‚Äôt forget it. Even to this day, I can vividly remember that pain, but it was not the worst I experienced. \n\nIn 1940, I was in England when the bombing, The Blitz, occurred. I was close to where a Fire Bomb hit. Not only was I burned alive but I was hit by debris and broke many of my bones. I was out more than a week and experienced that pain ten-fold continuously with no break. After that, I experienced night terrors, reliving that pain all over again. \n\nThe night terrors continued on for months after the bombing. It was so bad that I opted to not sleep. Due to this, I decided to go into hiding from the world. I didn‚Äôt mind traveling around previously, but technology was quickly advancing. The possibility of me being suspected weighed on me. \n\nAfter that, I watched as the world around me advanced to where it is now. I still traveled from location to location, but I tried to make it as discreetly as possible. This didn‚Äôt work out in my favor as an unnamed organization caught a whiff of my existence. It was mainly my fault, I stayed in a city longer than I should have and I got unwanted attention.\n\nI won‚Äôt go into all of the details of how I was kidnapped by the organization as it really isn‚Äôt necessary. Anyways, fifteen years ago I was kidnapped and tortured by that organization. Naturally, when I was kidnapped, I put up a pretty good fight and one of their agents ended up ‚Äòkilling‚Äô me. Even though I was ‚Äòdead‚Äô they took me with them to discard my body only for me to wake up a few hours later. \n\nThis prompted them to run various experiments on me to uncover the secret of my immortality. From electrocuting me, to poisoning me, to decapitating me; they tortured me in the name of science. They claimed they were doing this for the betterment of humans, but I highly doubted it. \n\nEach time I was ‚Äòkilled‚Äô I relived that torture for countless years. I was their test subject for a good four years. I only escaped because my body finally gave out from all of the various torture. They killed me via lethal injection and because of the constant torture I experienced, it took longer than they expected for me to heal and wake up. I guess they decided to discard me since none of their research proved fruitful.\n\nSo they disposed of my body and I woke up about a month later. Through out that month, I relived all the torture I experienced. Upon waking up, I refused to sleep for months and I avoided people all together. I lived in the woods as I thought of ways to destroy the organization. Thankfully, the organization was shut down by the government after it was discovered they experimented on humans. \n\nWhile I felt at ease not having to worry about that organization, it still took me years to be able to go out in public. Even now, I still tremble in fear from the thought of being discovered again, but that is why I move so frequently. A new city, new job, and new name. While I try to go on about my life, I still catch glimpses of that man out of the corner of my eye and hear his sinister laugh echo in my head. I‚Äôm not sure of who or what he is, but I do know he isn‚Äôt some nice, helpful person.\n\nI‚Äôm sure many of you reading this will feel pity more than being scared of my story, but I didn‚Äôt come here for pity. I‚Äôve made my peace with the decisions that I made that led me to this point and regret them. I was foolish and now I‚Äôm suffering the consequences. You don‚Äôt have to believe me, I don‚Äôt care, I‚Äôm merely writing this to be a warning to others. If you are ever in a dire situation and you meet a strange man offering you a gift, refuse it.",

        "text": "I had spent a loving six weeks with my baby boy Jasper before I received the letter in the mail. It came in a fancy light blue sealed envelope, with the simple words ‚Äúnew mom‚Äù. It didn‚Äôt display my address nor a return address. ‚ÄúHuh, weird?‚Äù I thought to myself, ‚Äúmust be from one of my neighbours‚Äù. I opened the letter to reveal an invitation to a free trip for new mom and baby. The letter described that a research company, FetaTech, has been interested in studying the effects of time zone changes, on maternal/baby sleep cycles. In order to make volunteers more enticed,  a free vacation to an ‚Äòisland getaway‚Äô was offered. The letter continued to state that during this vacation is when the research would be conducted. A phone number was provided to call to receive more information. \n\nMy initial reaction was to throw away the letter. It wasn‚Äôt uncommon to receive spam mail that ended up being a scam or something along those lines of: ‚Äúcome on this free trip, once purchasing this overpriced/unnecessary item!!!‚Äù. However, something intrigued me to look into it further. A quick google search yielded no results. I decided to call my girlfriend who had had a baby a few months prior to myself, to see if she had received something similar. ‚ÄúYeah, I got the same letter! Weird there was no address, but I called the number and it sounds legit‚Äù Jen said, ‚ÄúLittle Luke and I plan to attend, because if you‚Äôre as tired as I am, getting away somewhere sounds amazing. Even if it‚Äôs with the baby!‚Äù. I told her I would think about it and get back to her, she was right though, travelling away from home for a bit would be nice. Although I love Jasper, getting out of this house would be a good change of scenery. \n\nWhen my husband returned home from work, I showed him the letter. He looked over it with skepticism, but seeing how tired I was from taking care of Jasper, he softened a little. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre tired hun, but this letter is just a little sketchy‚Äù Oliver stated, ‚ÄúI can take you on a trip with the baby in a few months! Just give me time to save‚Äù.  Oliver wasn‚Äôt wrong that the letter came at random, but I pushed harder, ‚ÄúJen called the number and she said it sounds legit! Please Oliver, I‚Äôve thought this over all day and I‚Äôd really like to attend. It would be nice to be in a place where people understand the great, yet overwhelming experience of becoming a new mom‚Äù I pleaded. Oliver looked hard over the letter again, and with a sigh told me to call the number. \n\nThe next day I called, and Jen was right, it did sound legitimate. No purchase necessary. I provided my address and they would send the plane tickets in the mail in two weeks time, and we would fly out two days after. A private island off the coast of Mexico owned by the company, would be our destination; I could hardly wait and began packing that night. \n\nTwo weeks dragged on before I received the plane tickets. Jen and I had gone shopping to purchase some new outfits for ourselves and babe. ‚ÄúMexico, I am SO excited‚Äù exclaimed Jen. I agreed with her, I had never been to Mexico before and felt this was a much deserved reward for carrying my little munchkin for nine months. Jen and I carpooled to the airport two days later; a sea of moms and babies met us with a deafening roar. ‚ÄúWow, they really wanted to fill this plane,‚Äù I thought. While Jen and I waited for the flight, we met a few other mom‚Äôs and began to socialize. \n\nOnce we boarded our flight, a woman in a light blue pant suit greeted us at the front of the plane, ‚ÄúWelcome new moms, and thank you for the sacrifices you have made to become a Mother. I am Denaida, and will be hosting this trip on behalf of FetaTech. Please, if you have any questions or concerns, don‚Äôt hesitate to come talk to me‚Äù. The plane took off, while Jen and I chatted away about what we would do on our trip. ‚ÄúWhen I phoned, they said they had a daycare so we could spend some time away‚Äù Jen said ‚ÄúWe are definitely having drinks if that‚Äôs the case‚Äù. I laughed, it had been so long since I had had any alcohol. \n\nThe flight went by quicker than anticipated and we finally arrived at our destination. We were greeted right off the plane with a line of staff all dressed in light blue. Each member helped us to unload our babies and without hesitation began wheeling them towards the resort before I even had a chance to grab my luggage. ‚ÄúUhm, what are you doing?‚Äù I said rather panicked to one of the staff rolling Jasper away. ‚ÄúWe take the babies to your room, so you can grab your luggage‚Äù they exclaimed. ‚ÄúOh‚Äù is all I managed to get out, tucking the mama bear instinct away. \n\nThe resort sat right on the beach, with a view of the ocean that seemed to expand on forever. The rooms were quaint but perfect and once we were settled, Jen and I put the babies down for a nap and finally sat down. As we were taking a moment to enjoy the beauty of the island, a knock on the door snapped us out of our trance, Jen answered. ‚ÄúTwo drinks for two lovely ladies‚Äù as a staff member held two champagne glasses filled with a blue liquid, ‚Äúan island special. Dinner will be served promptly at 7pm‚Äù. Jen grabbed the two glasses and brought one over to me. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to us!‚Äù As we clinked glasses; the drink had a fruity flavour, that went down a little too easy. \n\nDinner time came, as Jen and I prepared our boys to join us. A staff member, Phoebe, saw us carrying Jasper and Luke, ‚Äúoh ladies, tonight is your night off. We have a nursery to put the babies in while you two enjoy your evening. It‚Äôs right this way!‚Äù.  Phoebe led us to a room filled with bassinets, toys, and all the necessities. A group of women in light blue outfits greeted us. All of them appeared tired, with dark bags under their eyes. ‚ÄúThese ladies will take excellent care of your children while you enjoy dinner! Here is the childcare itinerary for your viewing‚Äù stated phoebe, which included story time, sensory play and finally an evening beach walk for the children. ‚ÄúExcuse me a moment, I see some other ladies looking for the nursery‚Äù as Phoebe walked back to the dinner hall to greet them. \n\nOne of the nursery employees approached us, ‚ÄúBella‚Äù she introduced herself. She looked worried, her eyes darting back and forth to the door and back to us. She looked at both Jen and I, and stated one simple word ‚Äúrun‚Äù. Confused by this, I asked her ‚Äúwhat do you mean?‚Äù. Bella began whispering fast in Spanish, before Phoebe entered the room again. ‚ÄúOh Bella, she‚Äôs our newest employee here. English isn‚Äôt her first language! She tries out new words and phrases with all our guests to better her English. Right, Bella?‚Äù Bella looked down at her shoes, and wouldn‚Äôt meet Phoebes gaze. Bella carried both Luke and Jasper away. ‚ÄúCome along ladies, dinner is about to begin!‚Äù. I began feeling unsure about leaving, but Jen quickly reassured me that we are not far away if we need to see our little ones. This put my mind at ease, and we walked back to the dining hall. \n\nDinner was served in a twelve course style; each plate was decorated beautifully and absolutely delicious. The same island drink was served to us, until the last course. A spectacular orange drink, decorated with flowers and fruit was apart of our last plate. While reaching for her own, Jen knocked my drink all over my lap. ‚ÄúI am so sorry!‚Äù Jen said, as I excused myself back to our room to change. I was stopped at the door by two employees, ‚Äúsorry ma‚Äôam, you cannot leave until you have finished dinner.‚Äù I explained my predicament, and both employees looked at each other, ‚Äúdid you at least get to enjoy the last drink?‚Äù One employee exclaimed. ‚ÄúOh yes, it was wonderful‚Äù I lied, not wanting to offend them. ‚ÄúOkay, well be quick, we have a special show after dinner for all our guests!‚Äù.\n\nAfter cleaning up, I stopped by the nursery to check in on Jasper. Upon entering the room, I noticed it was empty. ‚ÄúHuh, they must have already started the walk‚Äù I thought. I quickly changed and returned to the dining room. I sat back down beside Jen, ‚ÄúHope I didn‚Äôt miss anything‚Äù I said, but Jen just stared forward, appearing miles away. Too much to drink I guess, ‚ÄúJen? You okay?‚Äù As I placed my hand on her arm. Her skin was cold and clammy to the touch. Jen slowly turned to me ‚ÄúSorry, the person you have spoken to is unavailable‚Äù she said in a monotone voice. ‚ÄúWow Jen, you really can‚Äôt handle your alcohol‚Äù I exclaimed with a slight chuckle. But as I began to peer around the room, I noticed each mom had the same expressionless face. \n\n‚ÄúThank you ladies, for your wonderful sacrifice‚Äù a booming voice said. My head snapped to the center stage, Denaida had begun to address the group. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know how special our project is, and because of you and your babies, we will finally be able to conduct our research‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome, Denaida‚Äù each mom chimed in unison. ‚ÄúJust wait and see what we have for all of you, today we begin to rewrite history‚Äù Denaida exclaimed. The pit in my stomach grew and grew until I couldn‚Äôt sit still anymore, I felt sick. A cold sweat broke out over my entire body and my brain began to scream ‚Äúleave while you can‚Äù. \n\nWhile Denaida rambled on, I planned my escape. I looked around the room for an empty exit, but each door was guarded by an employee in light blue. I continued to scan the room until I saw an open window behind one of the tables of women. I slowly slunk down my chair unnoticed and began to crawl towards it. As I was about to climb out I looked up and noticed the entire table was looking at me, their faces stretched into a horrific expression. Each woman began to point at me and scream. This drew attention from the employees who began to charge in my direction. I quickly slipped through the window and landed in the sand. I looked behind me and watched as the other employees began to follow me through the window. Alarms all around the resort began blaring. I ran as fast as I could, the only thing on my mind was finding little Jasper. \n\nI managed to give the employees following me the slip by hiding in a large patch of seaweed I found along the beach. My heart pounded as their flashlights scoured the beach. Once they passed and I felt confident they would not see me, I snuck around the resort building to find a way back in. ‚ÄúWhere could Jasper be?‚Äù As panic began to truly set in. As I was exploring, I saw a large white building separate from the resort we were staying in. I could hear the screams of several babies coming from it, and began to run towards it. What if that was Jaspers cry? \n\nAs I walked around the building looking for the entrance, I peered through the building window. Every baby that was brought to the island lay in this large building. Rows upon rows of bassinets separated the infants. People in white lab coats went from baby to baby, injecting them with a similar looking orange liquid that we were served with dinner. I frantically scanned the babies and noticed Jasper near the back. It appeared as though the people in white lab coats had not made it to him yet. \n\nDesperate to get into the building, I looked around for anything that could get me inside. I settled on a rock to smash the window, it was a risky chance but fear and adrenaline began to cloud my mind. I was about to smack the window when I noticed Bella, the original employee who had told me to run. As she walked by the window I lightly tapped on it hoping to get her attention. Her solemn gaze met mine and suddenly she lit up. She pointed to a door near the back of the building and swiftly walked there to meet me. As I approached the door, she opened it a crack. ‚ÄúPlease, Bella, please I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with this island. I just want my baby back‚Äù hot tears began to roll down my cheeks. ‚ÄúBaby name?‚Äù she stated, ‚ÄúJasper‚Äù I sobbed. Bella calmly walked over to where Jasper was laying and began to pick him up. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù another employee in blue demanded. ‚ÄúChange, baby needs to be changed‚Äù I heard her say. The other employee watched her sternly before walking off to the other babies. \n\nOnce the other employee was distracted, Bella brought over Jasper and handed me him, ‚ÄúBoat‚Äù is all she managed to say to me. She pointed over to the pier, ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù I said, ‚Äúyou have no idea what you have done for me‚Äù. Bella smiled a sad smile before gently closing the door. \n\nI did my best to sneak over to the pier, unseen by the other employees. Large search lights lit up the island in a sterile white glow. Jasper was nuzzled into my chest fast asleep as I searched the pier for a boat. I found a small row boat hidden under a black tarp. As I lowered myself into the boat, I stepped on something that crinkled beneath my foot. I realized it was a set of instructions, a flare and a small compass, it read as follows:\n\n1. Row boat to nearest buoy, about half a kilometre north. \n2. Once at the buoy, light the flare provided and help will come. \n\nI did as instructed and began rowing, Jasper remained asleep the duration of the trip to the buoy. Once there I lit the flare and waited. It felt like an eternity before another boat appeared in the distance, I prepared myself for the worst as I wiped my clammy hands on my pants. A young man pulled up beside me, he had a striking resemblance of Bella. I realized quickly this must be her son, as he helped Jasper and I onto the boat and tied off the row boat to the buoy. He introduced himself as Sam, and as I had thought, he was Bella‚Äôs youngest son. \n\nAs we made it back to the mainland of Mexico I learned  that Bella had been helping people escape the island for the last couple of months with help from her son. ‚ÄúEven if she can save just one, that‚Äôs why she stays there. To try to warn and help‚Äù Sam explained. I also learned about FetaTech and their actual intentions with us and our children. FetaTech was never interested in learning how our sleep cycles were affected by the time change, but rather how to override maternal/infant instinct and control the hosts conscious state. The orange drinks provided had the FetaTech virus-based serum and once ingested, began to act upon its host almost immediately. As the company realized that their product had worked, the next step was to test it out on the mother‚Äôs offspring which happened to still be in their infancy. Through this, they wanted to learn if they could alter the attachment between both mom and baby. ‚ÄúWhat do they gain from this?‚Äù I asked Sam, still confused. ‚ÄúMind control, if you will. They want people who are unattached to the things that mean the most to them. Less attachment equals easier to control. In this case, the bond between mother and child is so strong, that if they were able to alter that, it meant controlling and weaponizing the primitive nature of humans‚Äù. \n\nI sat there stunned, unable to comprehend what had just happened. It was nearing dawn, and we had almost made it to the mainland. I watched as Jaspers chest rose and fell as he slept. I had saved my baby and escaped that dreadful place. My heart became heavy as I imagined Jen and Luke still there. Once I was home, I would contact the proper authorities. Sam helped me acquire a plane ticket home, and I thanked him again. I told him to thank Bella as well, she truly saved my family. \n\nOnce we landed back home, I decided to take a taxi home in order to prevent Oliver from having a panic attack. He had already had reservations about my trip, and would worry as to why I was home after only 2 days spent away. I wanted time to prepare what I had to tell him, and to compose myself after such an experience. \n\nAs the taxi pulled into our driveway, I breathed a sigh of relief. With my hands still shaking, I fumbled to knock on our front door. The door pushed open, appearing to never be locked in the first place. Oliver made no reaction to the sound of the door opening and sat on the couch watching TV as I approached him. He often listened to it so loud, I wasn‚Äôt surprised when we didn‚Äôt hear me. ‚ÄúOliver we are home, and we need to discuss something‚Äù I said. Oliver gave me no reaction, ‚ÄúOliver?‚Äù I said again. He slowly turned his head towards me with that same look in his eyes as Jen had at dinner ‚ÄúSorry, the person you have spoken to is unavailable‚Äù he said in a dull tone. I began backing away in horror as he stared into nothing. I noticed movement in the kitchen and my head snapped towards the dinner table. Calmly sitting, Denaida‚Äôs smile stretched a little too wide ‚ÄúHello new mom and Jasper, I was hoping you‚Äôd arrive soon‚Äù.",

        "text": "My wife and I were both in our late 20‚Äôs. Our relationship was no different to most couples that age. \n\nWe loved each other wholeheartedly. We had our issues sure, but what couple didn‚Äôt?\n\nOne of our couple issues that we had was a disagreement over moving house. You see, we bought a little apartment when we were in our early twenties with the money we had. \n\nIf I‚Äôm being honest, it was a total dump but it was cosy and perfect for just the two of us. \n\nSkip forward a few years my wife Sarah wanted to move to a more expensive house a few streets away. \n\nYou see, Sarah‚Äôs sister Angie lived only a few doors away from this house. When Angie was 6 she fell from the second story of her home and landed poorly. This led to her being stuck in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. \n\nI always understood that Sarah wanted to help her sister as much as possible. They had always been really close after the accident according to her. Lurking a few doors away would allow Sarah to engage with her family significantly easier. \n\nSadly, we just didn‚Äôt have anywhere near the money to buy the house. \n\nSarah however, refused to take no for an answer, even though it was literally impossible for us to buy the house. \n\nThe weirdness started one night when I was home from work early. I decided to treat us both to some chicken teriyaki. I was a terrible cook but I wanted to do something sweet for her. \n\nNormally she‚Äôd make me the dinner as I was often home later so I thought I‚Äôd surprise her with my atrocious cooking.\n\nIn the middle of making our meals I remember glancing over my shoulder towards the hallway. \n\nI jumped back in fear as I saw Sarah standing in the open hallway glaring in my direction. \n\nIt was odd as I hadn‚Äôt heard the sound of the door opening. Almost as though she was sneaking up on me. \n\n‚ÄúJesus you scared the hell out of me‚Äù I shrieked. \n\nSarah didn‚Äôt respond. \n\nInstead she just stared at me from the luminous hallway. \n\nI could tell she was annoyed with me, she often gave me the silent treatment if I‚Äôd messed something up. \n\n‚ÄúOkay what‚Äôs this about then?‚Äù\n\nHer expressionless face suddenly changed. All of a sudden her eyes widened and mouth swung hung open. \n\n‚ÄúPlease help me‚Äù she muttered. \n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù I asked now feeling guilty about not asking her day. \n\nSarah then made a bizarre little twitchy movement with her face. Her expression then changed and the frown on her face somehow twisted into a broad smile. \n\n‚ÄúCan we please go visit that house?‚Äù \n\nThe way she said it was almost like the way a kid that had just seen a toy through a store window. \n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 6:46PM. I said no before. You know we can‚Äôt afford it too Sarah. I‚Äôd buy it if we could!‚Äù \n\nSarah then ushered backwards whilst still peering into my eyes before she jolted up the stairs away from me. \n\nFrom that point onwards, Sarah began acting extremely weird.\n\nShe became very emotionless. Whenever I‚Äôd ask her questions she‚Äôd often ignore me or answer with as little effort as possible. \n\nPhysically she was emotionless too. I‚Äôd catch her sometimes just standing still around random parts of the house. After saying her name a few times it‚Äôs almost like that would reboot her back into existence. \n\nSometimes during the night I‚Äôd be awoken and look over at her. I‚Äôd see Sarah‚Äôs eyes wide open staring at the ceiling. Like she hadn‚Äôt been sleeping at all and was on 500mg of caffeine. \n\nEvery single day, multiple times, Sarah would say the same things. \n\n‚ÄúPlease help me.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúCan we please go visit that house?‚Äù \n\nEvery time after I said no, she‚Äôd walk away from me and go do something else. \n\nThis went on for a while but on one night there was a tipping point. \n\nWe‚Äôd both gone to bed on one late Thursday night after not talking much following the work day.\n\nIn the middle of the night I awoke to the sound of rustling coming from across the room. My blurry sleep-deprived vision could just about make out the silhouette of my wife.\n\nFor some reason she was standing in the open doorway to the bathroom. As my eyes adjusted to the dull darkness that consumed our bedroom I could see my wife‚Äôs face more clearly. \n\nYet again, she was staring directly into my eyes. \n\nI froze with fear as I began to make out more of her facial features. \n\nHer hair was partially frizzy almost as though she‚Äôd been in a fight with another woman.\n\nShe looked really pale as though she had suddenly become deeply ill. \n\nHer eyes were what made me almost run out the house. They were wide and her pupils had dilated to a size I didn‚Äôt even think was possible. \n\nShe looked at me as though she genuinely wanted to murder me. \n\n‚ÄúWh‚Ä¶what is it Sarah?‚Äù I nervously asked. \n\nShe asked me in a sinister tone. \n\n‚ÄúCan we PLEASE go visit that house?‚Äù \n\nAt this point my fear was now conflicted with anger. This had gone on for too long. Why did she so desperately want to visit a house she knew we simply couldn‚Äôt buy? \n\n‚ÄúSarah NO! I‚Äôve had enough of this every day. Just SHUT UP!‚Äù \n\nSarah‚Äôs expression dampened a little however the stood firm. Suddenly, I noticed a tear begin to the edge of her right eye. \n\nI could see she was about to begin crying. I felt awful. It was always difficult for me to see her upset. \n\n‚ÄúOkay look Sarah I‚Äôm sorry I shouldn‚Äôt have yelled. If you really want to, we can go visit that house tomorrow after work. I‚Äôll try set something up with the estate agent.‚Äù \n\nI thought that after all this buildup up and persistence, me succumbing to her questions would‚Äôve brought about a reaction. \n\nNothing. \n\nShe didn‚Äôt react to it at all and just got into bed. I was disappointed but hoped that after we visited the house she would go back to normal. \n\nThe next morning I tried to make a call to the estate agent we‚Äôd previously learned about. Sarah had gotten his number before as I remember she said she wanted to ask the man some questions about the house before. \n\nI called the number a few times and received no answer. \n\nLater after work I told Sarah about this hoping she wouldn‚Äôt react in a dramatic way. \n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go visit anyway‚Äù she expressed. \n\n‚ÄúBut we won‚Äôt be able to get inside? We will only see the exterior of the house?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúWe can get inside‚Äù she said before poorly attempting to wink at me. \n\nShe surely wasn‚Äôt suggesting we break inside of the house. I brushed it off and decided to drive her to the house. Maybe if she just saw the outside of it she would be content. \n\nI made the short drive with Sarah giddy in the passenger seat. We arrived at the house and before I could say a word Sarah got out the car. \n\nI looked at her and said. \n\n‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶that‚Äôs the house!‚Äù \n\nShe gazed at it before her eyes darted back to me. \n\n‚ÄúNow‚Ä¶go inside‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat? We don‚Äôt have the key? The estate agent didn‚Äôt even answer our calls?‚Äù I asked bemused. \n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unlocked‚Äù she said with confidence. \n\nI started to creep up to the creamy wooden door. I then attempted to open it and to my shock it was indeed unlocked. \n\nAt this stage my curiosity was overcoming all my other emotions and I entered the house before Sarah had even taken a step away from the car. \n\nUpon opening the door, the most disgusting smell I‚Äôd ever experienced swarmed me. \n\nIt was unlike anything I‚Äôd ever smelled before. It made me gag but fortunately I didn‚Äôt vomit. \n\nI slowly moved into the relatively empty house before taking a left turn towards the living room. \n\nThe smell grew stronger. \n\nAs I now looked into the living room I could now see the source of the smell. \n\nMy heart dropped. \n\nI could see a human arm sticking out from my viewpoint in the hallway.\n\nThe large couch obscured the view to the rest of the human body. I felt suddenly extremely ill. \n\nCautiously I tip-toed into the living room to see behind the furniture. \n\nMy heart dropped as I could now see the full body. \n\nIt‚Ä¶was Sarah. \n\nShe was laying with her eyes and mouth partially hanging open. Her skin had turned a disgusting grey. \n\nI couldn‚Äôt fathom what I was looking at. I began to hyper-ventilate as I turned my head to the window. \n\nOutside I could still see what I thought was my wife, now a couple steps closer to the house. \n\nI looked her in the eyes before she then seemed to let out a faint smile in my direction. I then saw her slowly fade until she eventually completely disappeared. \n\nI burst into tears as I called the police.\n\nAfter months of depression and constant panic attacks the police were able to finally comprehend the full situation and explain it to me. \n\nPreviously, Sarah wanted to visit the house even though we couldn‚Äôt afford it. I said no to her as I thought it was a waste of time back then. \n\nIt turns out, that behind my back Sarah booked an appointment with the estate agent to visit the apartment and see how much she liked it. \n\nShe took a day off work to do this. \n\nOn that day she met up with the estate agent who was a man in his mid 30‚Äôs at the house. \n\nThe police told me that the estate agent appeared to have made a move on my wife Sarah. My wife rejected the approach which caused the estate agent to react angrily. \n\nThe police believe that the estate agent choked my wife to death as they found hand marks around her neck. \n\nHe was arrested fairly quickly after I discovered her body. \n\nIt was all my fault. \n\nI didn‚Äôt go with her. \n\nIf I was there I could‚Äôve saved her life. \n\nIf you can somehow hear this Sarah, I‚Äôm so sorry. \n\nI will always love you. \n\nI hope you can forgive me somehow.",

        "text": "I woke up [lying on my back](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11bst8c/voices_in_the_mist_the_bar_at_the_edge_of_reality/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), a cold, hard surface under me and silver mist floating lazily above me. My mind cleared surprisingly quickly, and the memories of what had just happened flooded back: the antlered wolf, the attacker, the voice beckoning and carrying me into the mist.\n\nHow long had it been? I had no idea. The fog made it impossible to tell what time of day it was. \n\nI slowly sat up, instinctively wincing at the pain I expected to feel‚Äîbut to my surprise, there wasn‚Äôt any. I looked down at my shoulder, only to find that it was fine. No blood. The hole in my sleeve where the wolf‚Äôs fangs had pierced through was still there, but all it revealed was my pale, unbroken skin.\n\nI tried to move my arm. No pain. Like it had never been dislocated at all. \n\nCurious, I reached up to my neck and felt the skin of my throat, where the ashen handprints had been aching since Orion‚Äôs first attempt to strangle me. The lingering soreness was gone. I didn‚Äôt have a mirror to look, but I suspected the handprints had also vanished.\n\nAll in all, I felt better than I had in days. For a second, panic flared in my chest as the thought crossed my mind that maybe that meant I‚Äôd been unconscious for a long, long time‚Äîlong enough to heal all my injuries.\n\nBut then I remembered that, you know, even time won‚Äôt un-dislocate a shoulder. *Duh,* Ian. Which meant that someone or something had healed me. \n\nSo where *were* they?\n\nI slowly got to my feet, turning around in a circle. While I was still surrounded by the endless fog, it felt different. Like it *wasn‚Äôt* endless, but rather contained in a finite space. Even though I couldn‚Äôt see a ceiling or walls, I could sense them somehow; they were there, just hidden by the swirling silver mist. As if I was in a large cavern.\n\nThere was something else, too. Whispers in the shimmering light, and as I watched, a shape flickered into existence near my feet: a marble headstone. Confused, I crouched down to read it. \n\nI didn‚Äôt recognize the name, though it was clearly the name of a dragon (trust me, they have very distinctive names). My heart immediately seized. Dragons don‚Äôt die often; if this was a real headstone‚Äîand to be fair, I had no idea if it was‚Äîthen it must be indicative of another murder.\n\nI reached out to touch it, to see if it was corporal, but before I could, the headstone shimmered and faded away, and something bright and silver, hot and flickering like a flame, rushed past me. I twisted to watch as the fragment of vivid, burning silver, much brighter than the surrounding fog, flew upwards and disappeared. \n\nThen I realized that it wasn‚Äôt the only one. Overhead, there were flashes of silver, varying in shades from nearly white to almost charcoal, some dull like iron, some shimmering like diamonds, and each rushed by before fading into the mist above.\n\nWere they‚Ä¶souls? Where the hell was I?\n\n‚ÄúBeautiful, aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù The voice seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere all at once. It reverberated around the cavern-like space, but also felt like it echoed within my chest. It was the same voice as had called to me earlier: old, powerful, magical. It held all the possible qualities at once somehow‚Äîdeep but high, quiet but booming, fragile but rich. \n\nAnd then something shifted in the mists ahead of me, something far above my head, and the fog seemed to part like it had been cut by a knife as a massive figure emerged.\n\nI can‚Äôt really do it justice in describing it to you. I don‚Äôt think anyone could. But I‚Äôll do my best.\n\nIt had four faces, arranged in a kind of diamond configuration, their edges blending together around the curves of its head. One looked relatively human, though its features seemed to shift every time my eyes moved; one was certainly inhuman, though it too seemed to change between races each second‚Äîfirst I thought it was a dragon, then a fairy, then an elf, and my brain couldn‚Äôt even register each species fast enough before its features shifted again; one was utterly discernable, because it seemed to be simply *light* in the rough formation of a face; and the last was simply a skull, plain bone with its skin stripped off and darkness swirling within its eyesockets like a living essence.\n\nAnd that was only the faces. The top of its convoluted head seemed to brush the just-barely-visible rocky ceiling of the cavern; its body was proportionally enormous, similarly composed of an incomprehensible array of elements that changed constantly. I saw skeletal arms, stark white; human hands with weathered skin; talons thicker than my legs; the decaying, rotting skin of a corpse; feathered wings stretching grander than its arm span; a shimmering green mermaid tail in place of legs; and everything in between. Each moment, each blink, the features and formation of the creature before me changed, seemingly making a new mix of human and inhuman, alive and dead, every single second.\n\nAfter a few seconds, I had to close my eyes. My brain couldn‚Äôt take it; trying to comprehend the shifting forms was impossible. It was physically hurting‚Äîmy head felt like it might explode.\n\nAs soon as my eyes closed, the pain vanished. It was like ancient stories of angels, then: its true form incomprehensible. I realized something else once I could focus, though. I realized that it felt‚Ä¶familiar. Even the few seconds I‚Äôd glimpsed had brought a sense of peace, of connection that I‚Äôd never experienced before, despite the utter chaos of its structure.\n\n‚ÄúMy apologies,‚Äù said the Ancient One. ‚ÄúI do not get a lot of visitors.‚Äù\n\nThere was an awful sound of bones snapping, of flesh squelching, and a moment later I felt a hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúYou can open your eyes.‚Äù\n\nI did. The Ancient One‚ÄîI knew it had to be the same being, because I felt the same connection to it as before‚Äîhad taken a more humanoid form, though it wasn‚Äôt *quite* human; something felt off. I think it was its aura; I could still sense the immense power at its core, so strong that the air around it seemed to quiver, making the edges of its humanoid figure almost blurry. Its form was about my height, a middle-aged man who looked‚Ä¶kind of like an older me, actually. It was smiling. And I sucked in my breath at its eyes: silver eyes, as shimmering and mysterious as the fog around us. \n\nSilver eyes, just like I‚Äôd seen in my unconscious dream. The same one where the attacker had appeared. What did it mean that I‚Äôd dreamed of them both before meeting? What did it mean that its human form resembled an older version of me?\n\nAnd how did I even get answers here? There was so much to ask. \n\nWell, I had to begin somewhere, and I figured it was best to start with the obvious. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the Ancient One,‚Äù I finally said. \n\n‚ÄúYes,‚Äù it agreed good-naturedly.\n\n‚ÄúWhere are we?‚Äù\n\nIt looked around the cavern slowly, at the appearing and quickly-vanishing headstones, at the flashes of silver flying overhead. ‚ÄúOn the edge,‚Äù it said. \n\n‚ÄúThe center of the planes,‚Äù I said, as everything I‚Äôd seen so far clicked into place in my brain. ‚ÄúWhere they all meet. Human and inhuman, alive and dead. The edge of reality. This is it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúThe only place I can exist. I am bound here. To watch, but never leave.‚Äù Its silver eyes seemed sad.\n\n‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked. \n\n‚ÄúI always have been,‚Äù said the Ancient One. ‚ÄúI bring balance to the universe. But such balance does not come without a price.‚Äù\n\nThere was a long pause. I didn‚Äôt really know what to say next. I had countless questions, piled in my head like snowdrifts. But how did I possibly sort through them quickly enough to know which ones to ask? What if the Ancient One was only willing to answer a few of them? Did I have a time limit for my presence here? I could barely even *think* through the madness of curiosities pressing against my brain, let alone process them enough to vocalize them.\n\nApparently, my crisis was more obvious than I‚Äôd thought, because the Ancient One said, ‚ÄúYou must have many questions. I know you have been trying to find me. Sit, and let me tell me what you need to know.‚Äù\n\nI stared at it. ‚ÄúJust like that? No, I don‚Äôt know, *trials* or something?‚Äù\n\nIt chuckled. ‚ÄúOf course not. I would not have brought you here if I did not want to talk.‚Äù It gestured for me to sit.\n\nWell, I supposed that was true. The Ancient One had carried me to its doorstep. I lowered myself to the ground, only to find that it was no longer the cold, hard surface that I‚Äôd woken on. Instead, it was soft and comfortable, as if I was sitting on invisible pillows. The Ancient One sat beside me, legs crisscrossed like the two of us were about to participate in an elementary school story time.\n\nI guess it *was* kind of like that. For me, at least. Bring on the stories.\n\nThe Ancient One sighed, a deeper sigh than I‚Äôd ever heard in my life, even deeper than Henri‚Äôs *Ian, shut up* sighs. It felt like that sigh carried the weight of the world. Maybe it did.\n\n‚ÄúOnly two other beings have ever visited me,‚Äù began the Ancient One. ‚ÄúOne was very recently, and you have already met her. The other was a long, long time ago, and it is the reason you are here now.‚Äù\n\nI was burning up with questions and remarks already; I literally bit my tongue to keep from letting any of them spill out. Interrupting might only annoy it, and I didn‚Äôt want to ruin my chances of hearing its stories.\n\n‚ÄúI suppose I should start from the beginning,‚Äù it said with another deep sigh. ‚ÄúForgive me. As I said, I do not get a lot of practice in storytelling. Listening and watching to others is not the same as doing it myself. So perhaps I should show you instead.‚Äù\n\nI looked at it with wide eyes. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù\n\nIt chuckled. ‚ÄúTrust me, you will be safe.‚Äù And before I could object, it reached forward and touched a finger to my forehead. \n\nImmediately the Ancient One and its cavern dissolved around me, giving way to infinite darkness. It wasn‚Äôt like passing out, though; I was still fully conscious. I think I was just seeing what the Ancient One wanted to show me.\n\nI heard its voice echo around me in the darkness. *I have existed as long as the world has,* it said. *I have always* been. *I was not born. I simply came into being when the worlds formed.* The darkness around me exploded with light, and I sat mystified as I watched, well, the building of everything I‚Äôve ever known. I can‚Äôt really describe it other than to say it was a blur of colors and shapes, sped up so I could watch hundreds of years in seconds, nothingness yielding to grass and mountains and oceans. I saw the development of Neverland and the human dimensions side by side, and I sensed the Ancient One‚Äôs presence there in the background, as it watched it all.\n\n*I am not a god,* whispered the Ancient One. *I did not build it. I merely watched, as I always do. I can watch, but not influence. A timeless curse.* I swear I heard it sigh again, from far away and somehow also right by my ear. *I was thrilled when beings developed. Beings I could observe, guide, and protect‚Äîif only from a distance. Humans and inhumans alike.* The side-by-side views of the dimension zoomed in so that I only saw Neverland. *Allow me to focus on the inhumans, for it is from them that my first visitor came.*\n\nI couldn‚Äôt believe it; the scenes around me had evolved into displays of what must be early towns and villages of Neverland. They played like videos, showing a quaint fairy town full of flittering pixies; an underground community of dwarves, built in tunnels and caverns; and then‚Äîand then!‚Äîa village I‚Äôd heard of since I was a kid, but never seen. A village in a valley, small but beautiful, inhabited solely by griffins.\n\nI saw griffins of all ages, walking the streets and having conversations. It made my heart ache, and only after a moment did I realize that the scene was narrowing still further, focusing on a blond teenager, who sat in an upstairs window of his house, writing in a journal. And as he glanced up to look outside, I couldn‚Äôt help but gasp. I‚Äôd know those lilac eyes anywhere, even if the years had caused crinkles at their edges. This was Henri, before he‚Äôd ever left home.\n\n*You know this part,* whispered the Ancient One, and the images before me sped up again, showing my uncle‚Äôs love story in fast forward: I watched him leave his village, pausing at the top of the hill to look back; I watched him meet Lucille, saw his joyful face as he fell in love at first sight; I watched the first city blossom in seconds, its vivid colors blinding against the stark landscape. I watched Henri and Lucille move there, watched Henri work his way up through the government. I dreaded what was coming.\n\nBut the movie never got there; it paused when Henri was promoted to a position on the city council. A few weeks, I knew, before Lucille died.\n\n*His isn‚Äôt the only story that imploded that day,* said the Ancient One. *Surely you‚Äôve wondered about the harbinger.*\n\nAnd the scene dissolved, immediately reforming into a dark town on a clifftop. Pale beings with dark eyes wandered its streets, and my field of view narrowed in once again until I was seeing one harbinger in particular, a tall, young man with glossy black hair. *They prayed to me then,* said the Ancient One. *They always knew of me more than most, since they walked the line between the living and the dead. They worshipped me, and I spoke to them in return. I tried to guide them, to help them help others. After all, the path their kind walks is not an easy one.*\n\nI thought of Asher and Acacia, of what Henri and Asher had told me about the ostracization they‚Äôd dealt with since the beginnings of Neverland, of Sky nearly killing Asher just because he‚Äôd dared to exist, of their fear not of the monsters in the dark forests, but of leaving its borders. The Ancient One was right; the harbingers had never had an easy path. \n\n*One in particular grew to worship me perhaps too much,* it said. The scene sped up again: I saw the glossy-haired harbinger praying at an altar, over and over again, multiple times a day; saw him spending hours buried in books, looking frustrated. *He sought to find me, to talk to me face-to-face.* Another sigh from the Ancient One that echoed through the visions around me. *And I, desperate for his attention, for someone to talk to, led him to me.*\n\nThe video showed the glossy-haired harbinger trekking through the silver fog, and then he was in this very cavern, talking inaudibly with the Ancient One in its silver-eyed humanoid form. I could make out only the faint echoes of their words, but the emotions were clear: at first reverent, then angry. The harbinger clearly wasn‚Äôt happy with the Ancient One‚Äôs words, and he began to yell, shouting and pointing fingers furiously. I gasped as he pulled a glinting sword from his belt and sliced at the Ancient One.\n\nI felt the Ancient One‚Äôs pain more than I saw it; the pain seemed to echo through the air, even its memory heavy enough to weigh on my soul. The harbinger slashed at the Ancient One‚Äôs hands, getting in several hits before the Ancient One‚Äôs eyes flashed silver, and it swept him away with a gust of mist-filled wind. The harbinger faded into the fog, and only once he was gone did the Ancient One sink to the ground, clutching its hands to its chest‚Äîwhere one finger on each hand was missing, dripping silver blood.\n\nThe image paused there. *He wanted to work with me, to be a prophet of sorts,* said the Ancient One, its voice twisted in pain and regret. *But he wanted power in return. Some of* my *power. And I couldn‚Äôt give it to him, even if I wanted to. It does not work like that.* This time, its sigh was sorrowful. *He did not believe me. He vowed that he did not need me to keep the balance, that he could do it himself, and that he would decide who died when. He wanted to make the rules. And I believe you already know how that turned out.*\n\nThe scene began to play again, in fast-forward. And thank God for that, because it showed the part I‚Äôd known was coming: the harbinger murdering inhumans‚Äîsome randomly, then ending up in the griffins‚Äô village, because it happened to be closest to where he‚Äôd emerged from the fog. No other reason. Pure chance. Somehow that made it even worse. \n\nIn rapid speed, I saw him kill more and more of Henri‚Äôs village, saw Henri show up, saw the confrontation‚Ä¶saw him kill Lucille. And then saw Henri kill him. \n\nI didn‚Äôt know if the scenes were going to pause after that or not, but it didn‚Äôt matter. I had to squeeze my eyes shut to slow the silent tears streaming down my cheeks. Deep breaths. I knew this already. \n\nBut it was still so much worse to see it firsthand. \n\n*No one came to see me again for hundreds of years,* said the Ancient One quietly. *No one knew he had met me, and it was best that way. Once the harbingers were exiled, many of them lost faith in me. My existence was doubted, though I could not have stopped the exile. I have always watched over them, however.* \n\nWhen I opened my eyes, the movie-like scenes had disappeared, and I found myself sitting in the cavern again, face-to-face with the Ancient One‚Äôs sad silver eyes. It held out its hands, and my heart seized when I saw the missing fingers. It had no ring finger on its left hand and no pinky on its right. \n\nMy throat felt very, very dry. I swallowed hard before trying to talk, but even then, my own voice came out cracked. ‚ÄúSo why now? Why the visitors?‚Äù\n\nThe Ancient One sighed yet again. ‚ÄúAs I said, the first was the reason for the others. You see, cutting off a piece of me is not so simple as a physical wound. It also separates a piece of my essence. Such a piece cannot be reattached‚Äîbut it cannot die either. No. It can, over many years in the fog, exposed to the energy of souls, absorb enough to become a new being of its own.‚Äù\n\nA slow, creeping suspicion was beginning to emerge in the back of my brain, but I was almost scared to say it out loud. ‚ÄúTwo pieces of your essence were lost.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes,‚Äù agreed the Ancient One. It said nothing else, just watched me with intent eyes. I got the feeling it was waiting for me to continue.\n\nOkay. Deep breaths. ‚ÄúAnd now there are two beings who can exist in both dimensions. That‚Äôs not a coincidence, is it?‚Äù I was holding my breath. I felt like I was standing on the edge of a cliff, about to leap off, never able to go back. The answer didn‚Äôt change who I was. It shouldn‚Äôt.\n\nSo then why did I feel like my entire identity rested in the balance of its reply?\n\nThe Ancient One‚Äôs face broke into a small smile. ‚ÄúIt is not a coincidence,‚Äù it confirmed. ‚ÄúAfter hundreds of years, those two fragments became souls of their own, and found their way to the edge of the fog. One was picked up by a human visiting your uncle‚Äôs bar. The other‚Äî‚Äù\n\n‚Äú‚ÄîWas found by Henri,‚Äù I finished, heart beating wildly. My palms felt sweaty. I‚Äôd wanted an answer for so long, but now I had no idea how to feel. ‚ÄúWas me.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said the Ancient One. \n\nI could deal with my existential crisis later. As tempting as that cliff looked, I had bigger things to deal with. More important answers to get. I took a deep breath, trying to slow the racing of my heart. ‚ÄúThe other was the murderer, right? You said they found you recently. How? Why?‚Äù\n\nThere was a long pause, like the Ancient One didn‚Äôt want to talk about it, but had to. ‚ÄúShe was not so lucky as to grow up somewhere that stabilized her existence,‚Äù it finally said. ‚ÄúLike yours, her body is not meant to live in one dimension alone. She traveled between them multiple times a day. I could do nothing to help. I had been weakened by the injuries, and even the guidance I had once provided was impossible. I could only watch and regret.‚Äù\n\nI thought of my jumps. I supposed I‚Äôd always known that they increased the further I got from Griffin‚Äôs Edge. They didn‚Äôt happen when I was at the bar; it‚Äôs why Henri had confined me there when they got bad. I had never thought about what my life would have been like if I hadn‚Äôt had a safe, stable home to return to. Jumping multiple times a day since I was little, unable to exist somewhere consistently? That would have been terrifying. Not to mention deadly. \n\nI almost felt sorry for them‚Äî*her.* Apparently the murderer was a she. But that‚Äôs the thing: I couldn‚Äôt *quite* pity her. Not after all the innocent beings she‚Äôd killed. I might be insane or dead if I‚Äôd jumped that much my entire life, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd become a serial killer. \n\nI mean, I hope I wouldn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs thinking too highly of my morals, considering how low a bar *not murdering people* is on the moral ladder.\n\n‚ÄúIt hardened her heart,‚Äù continued the Ancient One. ‚ÄúShe was angry. She wanted answers. And one day a few years ago, purely by chance, she ended up in the dark forests, as you so often have, and came across a harbinger. One of my last followers, and he was praying to me. She thought, as you did, that I might have answers. So she questioned him. She questioned him until he could tell her no more, and she did not believe him when he said that was all he knew. So she killed him. And she used what he‚Äôd told her to find me.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúOne of your last followers,‚Äù I echoed. Why did that ring a bell? \n\nLuckily, the Ancient One seemed to guess my question. ‚ÄúI believe you know his children,‚Äù it said quietly.\n\nIt all clicked. Asher and Acacia‚Äôs father‚Äîhe hadn‚Äôt just died. He‚Äôd been murdered by the very same murderer who was active now. The very same murderer I shared my origins with. And he, accidentally, had led her to the Ancient One.\n\nBut that didn‚Äôt answer what had happened in the years since. Had her conversation with the Ancient One led her to murder? \n\nI was about to ask just that‚Äîto ask about its meeting with the murderer, to try to find out exactly why she was doing it and how I could stop her‚Äîand to get somewhere. I felt like I was finally receiving answers, like there was some hope of ending this nightmare after weeks of fear and death.\n\nIt‚Äôs never that easy, though, is it?\n\nSuddenly the Ancient One went still, and its silver eyes shifted to look at something to my right: another marble headstone. I glanced at it and immediately turned back, because headstones had been appearing and vanishing the entire time we‚Äôd been sitting here, and flashes of silver soul had continued to whirl past us and spiral up into the fog. Surely this one would do the same.\n\nBut the Ancient One stared at it in reverence, its face fallen into sorrow. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù it said softly. Its voice creaked, not with age this time but with pain. ‚ÄúOh. A true loss. Not just for you. For the world. I am so sorry, Ian.‚Äù\n\nMy heart stopped. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù\n\nThe Ancient One finally ripped its eyes from the headstone to meet mine. Even when recalling its past, its gaze had never looked so sad. I think I knew what it was going to say a second before it said it, and I was already on my feet and sprinting into the fog as it whispered the name, the single word echoing around me. *Henri.*\n\nAny thoughts of hope I‚Äôd had moments before had vanished, replaced with sheer, unbridled panic. My brain reverberated with a desperate chant of *no, no, no, no, no.* The Ancient One, luckily, must have helped out, because I ran blindly in the fog and would have gotten lost if it hadn‚Äôt made sure I suddenly appeared on the paths outside the bar, much quicker than I should have. \n\nAt the time, of course, I didn‚Äôt even notice. I didn‚Äôt notice much of anything. Still chanting *no, no, no, no, no* mentally as if that would be enough to make the Ancient One realize that it had made a mistake and that Henri was completely fine, I barreled into [Griffin's Edge](https://www.griffinsedgebar.com/).\n\nI shoved through the crowd roughly, ignoring sounds of protest from the patrons. Henri wasn‚Äôt behind the bar, which meant he would be in his office.\n\nI took the stairs two at a time, nearly tripping over the crooked piece of wood on the top step. Henri‚Äôs office door was open. He never left it open. My blood had turned to ice.\n\nI rushed into the familiar office, only now everything familiar about it was ruined. The fire was out, leaving only smoldering ashes; Henri‚Äôs beloved books were ripped from the shelves, pages torn and strewn across the floor and desk; and worst of all was Henri.\n\nHenri, my uncle, my father in every way but blood, my only family‚Äîwas on the floor, lilac eyes staring up at the ceiling, glassy and lifeless. I fell to my knees beside him, desperately feeling for his pulse, whispering his name over and over, pleading for him to be alive even if I knew he wasn‚Äôt. His eyes didn‚Äôt look like his anymore. Their soul, their deep intelligence and love and everything that made him Henri, was gone, leaving only a shadow of who he had been. \n\nBut it didn‚Äôt stop me from crying his name as I took his cold hand in mine and laid on the floor beside him. I cried and cried until I had no more tears left, and then I whispered to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, Uncle Henri,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI never meant for this to happen. It‚Äôs my fault. I‚Äôm so sorry. I love you.‚Äù I choked over every other word. It felt all too real, and yet not real at all. \n\nI don‚Äôt know how long I laid on the floor with him, alternating between whispered apologies and resurgences of tears. It could have been forever or only minutes. I‚Äôd venture to guess it was closer to *forever,* though. Turns out I could cry an ocean and still not have cried enough to honor Henri like he deserved, or to fill the hole in my heart his comforting presence had occupied.\n\nFinally, sniffling back a fresh wave of tears, I reached out to close his familiar lilac eyes for the last time. There. Now at least, I could imagine that he was only sleeping, that he‚Äôd wake up to comfort me if I came running in after a nightmare, like I had every other night when I was five and terrified of vampires.\n\nHe would never do that again. How was I possibly supposed to go on existing when he would never be there to hug me again?\n\nIt was another eternity before I managed to get up onto my knees, then slowly make it to my feet. Countless monster fights, jumps between dimensions‚Äîand somehow standing up to face the world after Henri had been taken from me felt like the hardest thing I‚Äôd ever had to do. \n\nIt was then that I noticed something else unfamiliar out of the corner of my eye. Blinking back more tears‚Äîyou‚Äôd think I‚Äôd be dehydrated by now, but they just kept coming‚ÄîI made out that someone had carved words into Henri‚Äôs beloved desk: *You should have listened.* \n\nThe heartbreak and sorrow in me immediately turned to anger, fiery hot, drying any tears I had left. I didn‚Äôt care if she and I *were* the same; I wanted to kill her. Murdering innocent beings was already unforgivable. But murdering my uncle because I‚Äôd wanted answers? That was a whole different level of unforgivable. \n\nI knelt by Henri. ‚ÄúI know you taught me that revenge isn‚Äôt worth it,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúI know you regretted your actions against the harbingers. But this isn‚Äôt like that. She *is* a murderer. I know who I am, and I know who she is, and we are not the same. I‚Äôm going to end this. For all of the innocent souls who have died, and especially for you. Because I‚Äôm not like her. I‚Äôm like you. And I‚Äôll be proud of that every minute of every day.‚Äù\n\nI straightened up and headed for the door. If I didn‚Äôt leave now, I never would.\n\nI looked back one last time, swallowing yet more tears at the sight of Henri and his office. He would have hated the mess. I‚Äôd clean it up when, or if, I came home.\n\nThen I closed the door and walked towards the stairs, down the hallway that had once felt like home but now felt foreign, vowing to avenge my uncle‚Äîno, scratch that, my *father:* Henri, the very last griffin in the world.",

        "text": "[**CAMERA: ON**](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11d1f96/a_barista_an_overworked_daycare_attendant_a/)\n\n\"Alright, hoping this ol' camera is working. My name is Doctor Matthew Andrews, the coroner here at Millsview Hospital. I'm currently going to be accessing the body of a... Mr. Will Cheng. Ah, I actually know this boy, he's the son of Ms. Cheng, very sad to see him go. No matter, on with the log.\"\n\n*Shuffling heard in background, sheet moving heard in background.*\n\n\"Okay... Mr. Cheng here died due to a seizure that occurred while he was in a coma, time of death around six in the morning. If I could only find my scalpel, I should really just keep that in my coat pocket.\"\n\n*Chuckling from Dr. Andrews is heard.*\n\n\"We'll be making the first incision around his chest area, in a \"Y\" shape, like usual.\"\n\n*Humming heard in background from Dr. Andrews.*\n\n\"Well, it's sort of nice, it's like I have someone to listen to my banter... although instating this whole policy due to the lawsuit last month is a bit... overkill I'd say. I mean, recording every single one of my coronary reports? Absurd!\"\n\n\"You see, last month I had a young girls body come in, died after being impaled by a kitchen knife her father laid carelessly about... she fell directly onto it. Idiotic behavior resulted in the death of the girl, obviously. The girl might've lived if she had just grabbed onto something. But of course, it's the father's fault. I don't know how anyone could live with themselves knowing they'd essentially killed their own daughter. Monsters, I tell you.\"\n\n\"The girl's father sued, saying *I* hadn't recorded enough information on the report, and that I was jumping to conclusion off of bias, can you believe it? Man was insane, I tell you, insane.\"\n\n*Sound of liquid in background*\n\n\"Ah, shit, accidentally spilt my drink... I better clean that up later. Ah, great, and my lab coat is all dirty. How... annoying.\"\n\n*Groan heard, following shuffling of clothing, inferencing based off text being Dr. Andrews lab coat.*\n\n\"Bit unsanitary, but I can't work in a wet lab coat, can I? I got to remind myself to repair that old coat rack, the damn thing is constantly tipping over, such an annoyance!\"\n\n\"Alright, taking a sample of Cheng's blood here, and now placing it in one of these handy dandy machines that analyze the blood, it's quite interesting actually, it tests the blood in such a short amount of time, the entire toxicology department has been downsized to one person, showing how good these machines are! Hopefully they don't take *my* job.\n\n*Chuckling from Dr. Andrews is heard.*\n\n\"While that machine does its thing, I'll be continuing the incisions in Cheng. So far, it doesn't seem as if the seizure was related in any way to his nerve system, which is a bit odd. Just finished the incisions, now starting the investigation into the organs.\"\n\n*Humming head in background from Dr. Andrews.*\n\n\"Today's Martha's birthday, she would've turned sixteen today, she would've been able to drive! I still think about that day every single day.\"\n\nTone and volume of Dr. Andrews voice gets less bubbly, more \"sadder,\" and quieter.\n\n\"Martha was nine years old and desperate to fit in... she was invited to this girl, Josephine Stuart's birthday sleepover. It was supposed to be *\"all the rave, Dad!\"* I was supposed to be at home, watching the game, on my fifth beer. It was supposed to be a good night, the fire was roaring, and the cold couldn't get inside. But of course, I *had* to drive Martha, Lauren said it was *\"good bonding time with your daughter!\"* I told her I didn't want to do it!\n\n\"I brought a beer with me to the car, to try and savor the night, you know? Martha put her sleeping bag in the back, along with her bag, and I drove her over to the house, but of course the damn intersection stopped us. The light... the light was green; I know it was. The camera in that area was broken, so there wasn't any proof that it wasn't green. It had to have been green, my memory is just cloudy from that night.\"\n\n\"Martha was complaining about how she forgot her stuffed animal, and to... to teach her a lesson I swerved the car around, took a U-turn, nothing crazy, it's not even that illegal.\"\n\n\"Ford hit us straight on, some fucking crazy person didn't see the red light. Because the light was red, not green. It had to have been red for him. The car apparently tried to stop, but there was ice, and he wasn't able to. The Ford collided with my car, and the ladder on top of the Ford flew off, right into...\"\n\n\"Right into Martha's car seat. It's all that man's fault, and God knew it, so he punished the man. The man's seat belt stopped working, and he got flung out that God damn windshield. He deserved it, he killed my daughter.\"\n\n\"No other cars were there that night except for mine, the Ford, and a dozen police officers. I'm great friends with the police officers, I know everyone in town! They all helped me out of the car, gave me their condolences... those officers are great people. Especially Officer Victor. God, that man did so much for me. He helped me through tough times, pointed me in the way of pastors who could help me through my situation.\"\n\n\"It's not like it mattered, but he even threw away the beer bottle in the cup holder for me. We never really spoke of that, though. It's not like it was my fault, though.\"\n\n\"Goodness, I probably sound insane talking to myself in here, there's no one even here, just this dumb camera footage no one will ever review.\"\n\n*Light chuckle, still quieter and \"sadder.\"*\n\n*Dinging noise heard in background*\n\n\"Ah! Toxicology report is back, let's see... according to this Cheng was... hm.\"\n\n\"This can't be right... the toxicology report has some... concerning details in it, I'm going to quickly write them down on a sticky note and review them later so the body doesn't get too warm.\"\n\n*Quick scribbling noise heard.*\n\n\"Alright, getting back to the body...\"\n\n*Sudden banging noise heard, presumably from morgue freezer door.*\n\n\"What in the world, the freezer door just swung open, how odd.\"\n\n*Shutting of freezer door heard.*\n\n*Sudden banging noise heard, presumably from morgue freezer door.*\n\n\"Hm. Seems as if multiple doors in here are broken.\"\n\n*Liquid noise heard, and yelp from Dr. Andrews.*\n\n\"Oh goodness, almost slipped on the flask, I seriously must clean that up.\"\n\n*Shutting of freezer door heard.*\n\n*Sudden banging noise heard, presumably from morgue freezer door, followed by multiple other freezer doors banging open, and closed.*\n\n\"Alright, this is odd.\"\n\n*Sound of computer suddenly turning on, playing news clip. Each highlighted word was louder than the others.*\n\n*\"Today, tragedy struck in the small town of Millsview yesterday at around 7:00 PM, after beloved doctors' daughter, Martha Andrews tragically dies after being struck in head by a loosely secured ladder on top of a Ford truck that collided with Dr. Andrews car, reports here are saying-\"*\n\n*Sound of computer switching audios, this time to the \"Mom Spot\" blog.*\n\n*\"Managing children is hard, especially with that phrase. \"****It's your fault****, not mine!\" Well, today-\"*\n\n*Sound of computer switching audios, this time to a computer ad.*\n\n*\"It's hard breaking a habit, but people want to support you.

Each highlighter word was louder than the others.*\n\n\\*\"\\****It's*** *the pulmonary vessel that-\"*\n\n*\"I kept on trying to tell him it was* ***your***\\*'s, not mine!\"\\*\n\n*\"You see, the incision here clearly shows Dr. Edmont was not at* ***fault.\"***\n\n\"WHO THE FUCK IS DOING THAT? WHO'S THERE?\"\n\n*Dr. Andrews is now telling, loudly, loud foot steps are heard in background.*\n\n*A creaking noise is heard, and Dr. Andrews footsteps suddenly stop, and are replaced with a quick yelp, and a \"squeaking\" sound, something light then falls to the floor, following something louder, and then a finally yelp is heard from Dr. Andrews before the audio stops.*\n\n**CAMERA: OFF**\n\n*Based on the video from Dr. Andrews report, Dr. Andrews was quickly walking toward his wallet, keys, and phone, when suddenly one of the freezer doors opens up and hit him in the back, causing him to take a quick step forward. That step forward was directly in a puddle of alcohol, leaked from a flask Dr. Andrews had dropped earlier during the report. Trying to catch himself, Dr Andrews grabbed onto the nearest object, a coat rack, however the coatrack was not able to support him, and cracked in half, causing the coat rack to tip over, along with Dr. Andrews coat, and Dr. Andrews. In Dr. Andrews pocket was his scalpel, which slipped out of his pocket as he fell, causing him to fall directly on top of it. Dr. Andrews was impaled at around 7:00 P.M. by his own scalpel, resulting from the accident that took place.*\n\n*The camera oddly turns off without any interaction from outside forced.*\n\n*The camera is not turned on again until a few hours later, this time by a panicked Aiden Walker, a barista employed at the hospital's \"Mocha Cafe.\"*",

        "text": "CHAPTER 1: Monday\n\nMaggie had been practicing for months for the upcoming cheerleading competition. It was in exactly a week, next Monday, and it was the only thing on her mind. She had been dreaming of winning the trophy for years and was determined to make her team the best in the state. But fate had other plans. \n\nThere was a growing pathogenic threat which was already widespread across the planet. It was caused by a neuro-parasitic infection that spread through bodily fluids, and it had unique mechanisms to ensure its continued spread. \n\nScientists were still working toward developing treatments, and schools were closed down for two years. But last year, schools reopened. Capitalism required parents to be at work, and for parents to be at work they needed schools to be open so their kids had somewhere to go all day. Also, kids really needed to prepare themselves for the real world, to support themselves financially through the apocalypse. \n\nSure, half the population died and the undead wandered the streets, but things had to go back to normal eventually. Anyway, the infected didn't like sunlight, so they weren't really a threat on a sunny day, and with any common sense they were easy to avoid. Some privileged people who could afford to remain quarantined also viewed the pandemic as a form of Social Darwinism. They'd just wait it out, have their groceries delivered to their gates, and attend a few Zoom meetings a day, no problem.\n\nAs Maggie walked home from school on that warm spring afternoon, she decided to take a shortcut through a dark alley. It was a mistake that would change her life forever.\n\nOut of nowhere, an infected jumped out from behind a dumpster and lunged at her. Maggie screamed and tried to move out of the way, but the creature was too quick. It sank its teeth into her arm, and Maggie felt a searing pain shoot through her body.\n\n\"What the hell! Get off me!\" Maggie shouted, trying to shake the infected loose. But it was no use. The infected had a firm grip on her arm, and it wasn't letting go.\n\nMaggie struggled to get free, but it was too late. It had already infected her. As she watched in horror, the infected creature's eyes began to redden.\n\n\"Um, excuse me, can I help you with something?\" Maggie said sarcastically, trying to lighten the mood.\n\nThe infected just growled and continued to gnaw on her arm. Maggie knew she had to act fast if she wanted to survive.\n\n\"Okay, okay, I'll give you my allowance money. Just let me go, okay?\" Maggie pleaded, hoping to reason with the infected.\n\nBut the infected was beyond reason. It was now fully focused on turning Maggie into one of its own kind. As she felt her body starting to change, Maggie knew she had to get help fast.\n\nMaggie used her free hand to jab the infected in its sunken eyeball and stumbled out of the alley, clutching her wounded arm. She could feel the infection spreading through her body, slowly turning her. She had to find a way to stop the transformation, or else she would be doomed to roam the earth as one of the undead forever.\n\nAs she stumbled down the street, Maggie caught sight of her reflection in a shop window. Her eyes were turning bloodshot, her skin was starting to peel around the wound, and her arm was covered in a thick layer of pus and gore. Also, her hair was a mess. She stopped for a second to fix her long blonde ponytail. She was turning into a monster, and there was nothing she could do to stop it. But she wouldn't be a monster with bad hair.\n\nMaggie's thoughts turned to the cheerleading competition. She had been practicing for months, and now she was changing into an undead monster just a week before the big event. She couldn't let her team down. She had to find a way to stop the transformation, no matter what it took.\n\nMaggie stumbled down the street, her arm throbbing with pain. She knew she had to find her uncle Jerry, the mad scientist, er, freelance biochemist who lived on the other side of town. He had been working for years on an inoculation to prevent infection spread, and he was her only hope.\n\nAs Maggie approached her uncle's lab, she could hear strange noises coming from inside. She hesitated for a moment, wondering if she was making the right decision. But then she reminded herself that this was her only chance to save herself and her cheerleading team from a fate worse than death.\n\n\"Uncle Jerry, it's me, Maggie!\" she shouted, pounding on the lab door.\n\nA few seconds later, the door creaked open, and a cloud of smoke billowed out. Maggie coughed and waved her hand in front of her face, trying to clear the air.\n\n\"Hey there, kiddo. What brings you to my neck of the woods?\" Uncle Jerry said, grinning from ear to ear.\n\nMaggie glared at him. \"I got bit by an infected, Uncle Jerry. I need your medicine to stop the transformation.\"\n\nUncle Jerry's eyes widened. \"Whoa, whoa, slow down there. You got bit? How the hell did that happen? Did you go in the dark?\"\n\nMaggie rolled her eyes. \"It just happened. Can you just give me it or not?\"\n\nUncle Jerry stroked his chin, looking thoughtful. \"Well, I do have a treatment that might delay the transformation. But it's not foolproof, and it might have some side effects. It's still in development.\"\n\nMaggie didn't care. She just wanted to stop the transformation before it was too late. \"Give it to me, Uncle Jerry. I don't care about the side effects. I just need to make it to the cheerleading competition.\"\n\nUncle Jerry nodded, pulling a vial of cloudy liquid from his refrigerator, and filling a syringe. \"Okay, hold still. This might sting a bit.\"\n\nMaggie gritted her teeth as Uncle Jerry injected the fluid into her arm. She felt a strange tingling sensation spread throughout her body, and then everything went black.\n\nWhen Maggie woke up, she was lying on the lab floor. She looked around, feeling disoriented. \"Uncle Jerry? What the hell did you do to me?\"\n\nUncle Jerry chuckled. \"Relax, kiddo. You just passed out for a minute there. It's a common side effect. \"\n\nMaggie groaned, rubbing her head. \"Great. Just what I need.\"\n\nUncle Jerry patted her on the back. \"Hey, at least you're not turning anymore, right?\"\n\nMaggie had to admit, he had a point. She felt a little better already, like the medicine was fighting off the infection inside her. She knew she wasn't out of the woods yet, but at least she had a fighting chance.\n\n\"Thanks, Uncle Jerry. You're a lifesaver,\" Maggie said, getting up from the floor.\n\nUncle Jerry grinned. \"Ah, no biggie. Just doing my part to keep the world safe from zombie cheerleaders.\"\n\nMaggie couldn't help but laugh at that. \"Yeah, I guess I owe you one for that.\"\n\nAs she walked out of the lab, Maggie knew that her life would never be the same. She had been bitten, injected with a mad scientist's concoction, and she was soon competing in the cheerleading competition of a lifetime. She had no idea what the future held, but she knew one thing for sure - it was going to be a wild ride.\n\nMaggie stumbled into her bedroom, exhausted from the day's events. She couldn't stop thinking about the strange side effects that Uncle Jerry had warned her about. She hoped that they wouldn't be too severe.\n\nAs she crawled into bed and closed her eyes, Maggie felt a strange tingling sensation in her limbs. She brushed it off as fatigue and drifted off to sleep.",

        "text": "Part 1\n\nMe and my friend got bored one day around 11 at night but we remembered something we could go to there was an abandoned house it must have been. Abandoned no longer than 40 to 50 years, we got In after a long walk that lasted 20 minutes to get there when we saw the house. It looked really beaten up plants was over grown all over the house. The red paint was almost nonexistent, the wood on the door. And the house was chipped, and Rowlett it looked like it was going to fall at any moment, but being dumb bored teenagers, we still went into. The house first thing I felt there was something or someone was watching us and then the smell of the inside of this house hit us. It smelled like rotting food and must have been like the people who lived here didn't take anything but a few things with them before they left in a hurry the. Shoes jackets hoodies just left a few feet a away from the door and the fridge and the furniture was left and the house made creaking noises almost ever step into the kitchen and the hallway into the living room. The house looked a lot better on the side , and the outside wasn't as broken down. we started to wonder why this place was. Abandoned than there was a sound upstairs. Sound it like something fall we looked at each other then he started walking out to the hallway then I started to follow him all the way.\n\n\n\n\nTo the stairs and walked up the stairs hearing every crack and creek all the way up the stairs. It looked nowhere near as good as it did downstairs there was 2 hallways and 6 doors and we went down the hallway in front of us we went in each door we split off to one side each of the hallway. To make the looking around faster, there were 4. Room 1. Bedroom 1. Bathroom 1. Spare room and 1. Master bedroom.  They looked like the hallway but just with more stuff in them, but then we heard something that. Stock me to my very core it was a deep dark laughter from the hallway we didn't go down, yet we went by the stairs and seemed the thing that made this laugh it had red eyes. And a black figure, but it didn't look transparent like a black mist it disappeared around the doorway. For some reason, we didn't leave then, and there we just had to go see. What it was we went into the room there was nobody in there no way out but the door then we heard the laugh in the hallway I seem only. For a moment before it went downstairs, we wanted to go to leave right then and there, but it was at the. Bottom of the stairs and all I felt was a deep hatred then the laugh and it was gone just like that we didn't wanna stay there for any longer. We started to run down the stairs out the door into town, and we both went home after and talked. About what happened the next day, but it didn't stop there for me.\n\n\n\n\nThe dreams the laughs the sounds the whispers the dreams didn't stop until my friend went back to the house when I seem him the next day he looked like a shell of himself but he wouldn't tell me what. Happened to him, but after that was the last day anyone.  Had seem of him, but I know he's in that house, and I will get him out of there, but I know that red eyed thing is not the only thing in that place\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\nAlmost four weeks of my friend being missing and no one knowing where he was except me from thinking he's in that house. With the red eyed thing and whatever else is going to be there. I knew it was going to be one hell of a night trying to get him out of there. I didn't even know if he was still alive, but I was going either way. The sun was starting to go down around 9. I was getting ready with whatever weapons I could find that may be able to help in this crazy night that was sure to come. I found a bat and a pretty big knife and lighter and a spray can, hoping this stuff was going to help me. Now I was really to go to the house it around 10,30 at night it was pretty much pitch black when I got to the house. It still looked as broken down from the last time I was here, but maybe just a little more this time, and I already felt something bad was going to happen tonight before I when In I was questioning was some really bad fever dream.\n\n\n\nBut I put that feeling down and got my bat out and put my knife in my waistband and opened the door and didn't even hear the laugh from the red eyed thing. I still didn't really know what it really was, but it was pure evil than something I was hoping wasn't going to happen. There was more than one of whenever was in this house it wasn't what the eyed thing was it was more a transparend mist. I looked in the hallway, the kitchen, and the living room. There was nothing in here until I heard a muffled yelling from the basement. I looked at the door, knowing I had to go down there, and then the feeling I had before I came into this house hit like a freight train, but I knew I still had to save my friend he was down there he had to be I walked to the door with a. Pit in my stomach it wasn't as bad when I got to the door it doored with a loud creek the stairs were no better with sounds but what was heard the most was the muffled yelling he was in the middle of the basement. Tied up in a chair and gagged, he was yelling something to me. I took the gag out, and he yelled behind you. I turned around to see the red eyes right in front of my face. I could almost feel its cold breath on my skin, but I was able to get my knife out of my waistband and slash at the black mist, and it disappeared for enough time for me to set my friend free but I heard the same laugh I heard when I come in from up the upstairs I got really with my knife and my friend with the bat and we started walking up the stairs and when I went through the doorway and all I felt was a deep crushing pain and I fell to floor and saw blood my nose was broken and than my friend was thrown across the room I got my lighter and spray can really to turn around nothing was there but than I looked where my friend was thrown then the red eyed thing was getting closer to him I had get up fast. \n\n\n\nAnd I ran to it and started to light it up it worked, but I knew that wasn't going to my last problem before I left this house, and my friend wake-up groaning in pain I helped him up and started walking to the front door than a black mist came in front of us and I knew those things wasn't going to let us leave easy I put my lighter and spray up and for some they disappeared it was weird but there was no time to think on it so we ran out door. But before we left I heard the laugh knowing I will hear that laughter again soon then we kept on running away from that house but then there was deep earth-shattering scream that came from deep in side the house we just kept running until we got to town he went home and I did to the next was great the town through a party for his re turn he didn't tell them what really happened and where he was he just told everyone he got lost in the woods and everyone was happy with that answer I don't think anyone believe him. They we're just happy he was safe after the party I was in my room thinking about that scream I heard before we left then I realized how tried I was I close my eyes about to fall to sleep then I heard the laugh knowing it wasn't over just yet",

        "text": "I'm not popular at school. My area of town is super upper class, making me the black sheep of the school. And kids are mean. I know, that the truth is it was never really personal. They just found a reason to dislike me, and put all their anger into it.\n\nMy particular bully, Skye is the type of bully you'd expect. Shes pretty  and athletic and her only real flaw is her unbelievable privilege. Maybe if she'd ever had to work a day in her life, she wouldn't turned out the way she did.\n\nI walked into class, settling into my seat and putting my head down to rest my eyes for a minute. I whipped around, upon feeling someone tapping my shoulder to see Skye walking away snickering at me. I just turned back around, continuing my little nap.\n\nI, along with being bullied was also shy. I'd never confront her, afraid of the further torment that would follow.\n\nAs I was dozing off, waiting for class to start I was quickly jolted awake as the class erupted in giggles. I turned around, feeling my face turn flushed as I met the eyes of the whole class.\n\n\"On your back.\" The quiet girl, directly behind me whispered sheepishly. I pulled a piece of paper off my back. \"Trailer-trash\" was written across the paper with a caricature of me drawn poorly. Mortified, I excused myself to the bathroom.\n\nI sat in a stall on my phone, texting my mom telling her I had a stomach ache and needed her to come get me. I wanted to sink into the floor, through the earth's crust and curl up in its warm center and just sleep forever.\n\nScribbled across the bathroom door, \"RAY IS SUCH A SLUT\" The idea came to me, a I grabbed a sharpie out of my bag and wrote \"SKYE IS A STANK ASS BITCH.\" on the wall of the bathroom. I knew it wouldn't help anything, but it felt good to take my anger out on something.\n\nI composed myself, and returned to class. The entire room smelt putrid, like something crawled into the walls and died. \"God what is that smell? It must be Marie, she probably doesn't have water running in her trailer home!\" Skye remarked, giggling.\n\nThe next day, the bullying continued. Including by the boy I had a crush on, Kai. We used to get along really well before Skye spread rumors about me sending nudes to him. Of course, this drove him away from me.\n\nI walked into class, yet, for once the attention was not on me. \"Dude, Skye, you reek!\" Her best friend, Naomi blurted out covering her mouth. \"I'm sitting by Ray, it stinks over here.\" The class, for once, erupted with laughter but not at me.\n\nI was in the bathroom, washing my hands later on the day when the same girl who alerted me about the note on my back stomped into the restroom. She was paper thin, and so pale she was almost translucent. Her appearance was all to similar to a ghost, and I wondered deeply how she was never targeted or bullied either.\n\nI could her the squeaks of her sharpie, as she furiously wrote on the wall, sniffling. Moments later, she came out puffy eyed. Once she left, out of curiosity, I peeked into the stall. \"SKYE IS A WORM.\"\n\nI laugh softly, the insult was sort of funny. I wonder what Skye did, as I never knew they had any sort of complications let alone even acknowledged each other's existence.\n\nScreams blare from my classroom right as I step into it, everyone crowded something in the corner of the room. I notice her, the quiet girl Leah stood in the opposite corner of the room watching silently. Eerily unbothered.\n\nI step into the crowd, getting a better look at what it was they were all staring at. On the floor, was a worm the size of a cat or dog. It writhed and wriggled around, emitting wet slopping sounds as it did so. A girl stepped back, bumping into me and another guy before throwing up on the floor right in front of me.\n\nThe worm lurched forward, suctioning itself onto Ayden, Skye's boyfriend. He wailed, kicking his leg back and forth. \"Shit, guys get this thing off me holy fuck!\" He yelped, falling to the floor.\n\n\"She really is a parasite.\" A soft whisper came from behind me. And that's when it hit me, I turned around, face to face with Leah. I pushed her to the side, making my way through the small crowd and rushed into the bathrooms, wetting a paper towel and scrubbing the marker off the wall.\n\nIt took me a good few minutes, before it was totally gone. I panted, and sat down on the toilet afraid to go back to class and face it again, if it hadn't worked.\n\nThe stall door opened, and Leah stood in front of me. \"Oh my god, you knew didn't you?\" I scream.\n\n\"Mhm. I did. Sort of, I guess. I didn't know if that would work, exactly. But I've used the wall before.\" She said, stepping into the stall and closing the door behind her.\n\n\"Wait-- please don't do anything to me, I won't tell anyone I really wont--\" I begged, watching her pull a sharpie out of her pocket and begin to scribble something vigorously on the wall. She raised her two bony fingers to her lips, shhing me and winking.\n\nShe turned and left the stall, without saying another word revealing what she'd wrote. \"No one can save you.\"\n\nThose words sunk deeply into my mind, as I recounted the torture she'd put me through. The mental torment, as she slowly and meticulously derived plans to isolate me from everyone. The after school beatings that no matter how much I'd report, they'd go unnoticed due to her \"bright future.\" I thought of every student who aided her in her bullying, who turned a blind eye, who watched her beat me.\n\nI then thought of my mother, at home drunk on the couch with an empty pill bottle at her side barely alive and my father in some new city with some new girl in some new apartment, with an eviction notice hanging from his door.\n\n\"SKYE IS A PIG FACE, AYDEN IS A COWFACE, NAOMI IS A RAT FACE, KAI IS A DOG FACE,\" and I continued my list, as I listened to distorted versions of snorts, moos, squeaks, barks, meows, a grotesque mix of human screaming and animal. \n\nI believe I am doing them a favor. There is no place for any of us in the world, I truly believe. I think we are all evil. And I won't stop until every last one of us is what we were supposed to be from the very begining, savage animals.",

Abandoned no longer than 40 to 50 years, we got In after a long walk that lasted 20 minutes to get there when we saw the house. It looked really beaten up plants was over grown all over the house. The red paint was almost nonexistent, the wood on the door. And the house was chipped, and Rowlett it looked like it was going to fall at any moment, but being dumb bored teenagers, we still went into. The house first thing I felt there was something or someone was watching us and then the smell of the inside of this house hit us. It smelled like rotting food and must have been like the people who lived here didn't take anything but a few things with them before they left in a hurry the. Shoes jackets hoodies just left a few feet a away from the door and the fridge and the furniture was left and the house made creaking noises almost ever step into the kitchen and the hallway into the living room. The house looked a lot better on the side , and the outside wasn't as broken down. we started to wonder why this place was. Abandoned than there was a sound upstairs. Sound it like something fall we looked at each other then he started walking out to the hallway then I started to follow him all the way.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo the stairs and walked up the stairs hearing every crack and creek all the way up the stairs. It looked nowhere near as good as it did downstairs there was 2 hallways and 6 doors and we went down the hallway in front of us we went in each door we split off to one side each of the hallway. To make the looking around faster, there were 4. Room 1. Bedroom 1. Bathroom 1. Spare room and 1. Master bedroom.  They looked like the hallway but just with more stuff in them, but then we heard something that. Stock me to my very core it was a deep dark laughter from the hallway we didn't go down, yet we went by the stairs and seemed the thing that made this laugh it had red eyes. And a black figure, but it didn't look transparent like a black mist it disappeared around the doorway. For some reason, we didn't leave then, and there we just had to go see.

        "text": "This happened around 3 to 4 months ago when I was on the bus ride home from school, me and my friends were at that time talking about Call Of Duty. Randomly this other kid came to the back of the bus, we thought nothing of it. Around 5 minutes later the same kid got in a big argument and threatened a kid with a knife, then just continued to curse him out like nothing happened. The crazy thing was that this kid's foster brother heard him and started yelling \"Aye don't call him that,\" and \"chill out bro.\" Then the brother of the kid came to the back, this was a bad idea on his end. They got in an even bigger argument that we had to break up, everybody was screaming \"Chill the F out,\" my friends and I will never forget the moment this dude jumped out the back emergency door. Everybody went crazy as we say him go into the ditch right next to my Rhett's house, the bus driver tried to calm everybody down but to no avail. The craziest thing on this bud ride however was 5 minutes later, my friend Rhett was getting dropped off and we saw the kid on the sidewalk. We all told Rhett to capture him and make sure he doesn't go missing or anything. The next day we saw Rhett and the crazy kid at school with bandages, black eyes, and swelling. Rhett told me that he had to practically fight him and then call the school for the school police to get him. We thought this was all over after that but no, 2 weeks later we think it was just an insane moment and not like him but this kid proved us all wrong. This kid got in another massive argument that again had him jumping out the back door, but this time this psycho decided to headbutt the Emergency Door glass and he actually broke it after 3 headbutts. Everybody went crazy and were screaming horrified, the worst thing is my friend porter was doing a joke and was behind the seat so he had to crawl out onto the broken glass. Me and a few other guys, a passerby, and the bus driver restrained him but he was still kicking windows and got loose after about 30 seconds. The kid jumped out the back and started circling the until he found another striking point, the entrance of the bus. He started to punch, kick, and ram into the door until it broke and he was back in. Thankfully I called the cops 10 minutes earlier and the kid was caught. We started to evacuate the bus while me and Rhett comforted a kid who was crying and trembling with fear, then in my right ear I heard this from the insane kid \"I'll kill all of you!\" The kid rolled down a window and said that. Then people started pulling up, more police, ambulance, Principle, Vice Principle, and the crazy kid's homeroom teacher. Now this time we really thought it would be over, but no 1 month later the kid has his own private bus with a police officer escorting him around, and mental health counseling all day while inside of the school.",

        "text": "It was a typical day at work for me. Being a park ranger where part of the land is a swamp is a unique job. Because then certain things need to be done, no different than a fish tank or aquarium. Water is an entire ecosystem all by itself.\n\nI was halfway through my shift, and so far, it had been a routine day. All the rangers had their typical route or routes, and I was in the middle of mine. When minding your route, it‚Äôs not exactly an exact science. It‚Äôs more along the lines of something you get incredibly familiar with, then you notice when something is off. That‚Äôs when it‚Äôs your job to check it out or keep an eye on things. \n\nI was just about to keep on driving when I saw something peeking out from behind a cluster of trees. It was early afternoon, so there was plenty of light to point out that it was some kind of vehicle. So once I radioed in what I found, I switched off my car, and started walking towards it. \n\nThe air was thick with humidity, and moss was strung around the trees in thick clusters. The humidity around here can take some getting used to, and while I‚Äôm mostly used to it, there are some times when it‚Äôs intense, even for me. Today was one of those times. The promise of a dense rain hung in the air, and it was badly needed. Even the few bugs flying around seemed to be lacking their usual enthusiasm. \n\nBut one thing that didn‚Äôt fit was the vehicle, which I could see was hidden away between a bunch of shrubs. How did it get here? And even better, how did no one spot it? I could see even from the road that it wasn‚Äôt a sedan or something that could be easily hidden. As I got closer, I could see it wasn‚Äôt just a vehicle, it was an RV. And not a modern one either. This was an old one, easily a few decades old. The paint was badly faded, which went a long way to help it blend into the background. That‚Äôs the thing about nature. Given enough time, it‚Äôll reclaim anything that‚Äôs there. It doesn‚Äôt matter if the environment is forest, swamp, desert, or beach. Nature is nature. Which meant I wasn‚Äôt surprised that all signs pointed to nature making good progress at reclaiming the RV. It was covered with vines, and as I got close enough to see it in detail, I could see numerous scratches on the side. They were varied in size and length. Some were very shallow, barely making a mark, while others went very deep. They were all over, but most were centered around the front door by the driver‚Äôs side. \n\nWhat happened to this RV and how did it get here? It wasn‚Äôt huge, but it wasn‚Äôt small either. There was an enormous amount of water around here, and it could‚Äôve conceivably floated in from somewhere, as the beginning of the swamp that went on for miles was right here. The other possibility, that the RV had just been placed here, was a lot more difficult to believe. For starters, there were no tracks leading either to or away from here, and we would have noticed someone bringing it in. So that meant it must‚Äôve been slowly making its way through the swamp and connected water for a long time. But RVs, even back when this thing was made, were not cheap. So someone had to part with it, either willingly or unwillingly. And it was our job to figure out what this thing was doing here.\n\nJust looking at it gave me the creeps. There was no telling what lurked inside. Fortunately, I was saved from further speculation by my fellow park ranger and good friend Trent, who had just pulled up in his truck. He‚Äôd been on the job a year longer than I had, which meant he‚Äôd been here five years. \n\n‚ÄúHey Charlie,‚Äù he said to me as he stepped out of the truck. ‚ÄúIs this it?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúSure is. You ever seen it around here before?‚Äù \n\nHe shook his head. ‚ÄúNope. Have you?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNever.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs weird. You‚Äôre pretty observant, just like a few others are.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúThanks. You‚Äôre no slouch yourself.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAppreciate it. So how did we not see it?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúBest I can think of is that it floated down here. You could see it happening by how the land slopes down. Something that size, plus filled with who knows how much water? I could easily see it.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúRight.‚Äù Trent put his hands on his hips and stared at it.\n\n‚ÄúBut something like that doesn‚Äôt just get rid of itself. There‚Äôs gotta be some objective reason and motivation to dump it.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúI see what you‚Äôre saying.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúUh huh. The only question is why.‚Äù \n\nI took a step closer to the old RV, and for the first time, I was able to see through the front windows. That was when I realized why the bugs around here seemed to be lacking their usual enthusiasm. I could see them crawling on the windows from the inside, and those that were outside were floating around it in a thick layer. That was all the cue I needed to radio in for even more rangers to help investigate whatever was inside. Because bugs just don‚Äôt swarm somewhere for no reason. \n\nWhen the other rangers showed up, they slowly opened the RV door, and the smell hit us like a truck. It was so bad it made my eyes water, but Max and a few other rangers put on bandanas and looked inside. The rest of us stayed outside and kept watch until they returned a few minutes later. They wasted no time in shutting the door again before they get rid of their bandanas and took deep breaths of fresh air. \n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing inside but some weird writing on the walls and some candles that were used once for something, but are now just small stubs of wax,‚Äù Max said.\n\n‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù Trent asked. \n\n‚ÄúSomeone used this camper for something. Nothing good I‚Äôd imagine. That smell doesn‚Äôt come from nowhere.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúNo doubt.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúI have no idea what‚Äôs written inside the camper, but it didn‚Äôt exactly seem like something pleasant. I won‚Äôt lie, I didn‚Äôt like being in there for one minute, and that‚Äôs not even because of the smell.‚Äù \n\nMax took out his phone and swiped through it before he held it up for us to see. There were pictures of the RV's interior, which was just as old and faded as the outside. Definitely a throwback. Ancient carpets, cabinets that were older than I was, and curtains that were probably last in stores decades ago. But there was something more than that. The strange writing dotting the walls in several places made me feel weird. Uneasy. \n\nIt didn‚Äôt take me long enough to have enough of a look at the place, and Trent felt the same way. Once the team finished logging the find and reporting it to the authorities, we put a barricade up around it and went back to the ranger station. After enough time, the smell that had seemed to cling to everything began to dissipate. But I also began to feel slightly chilled. Not freezing, but like the temperature had dropped a few degrees. I chalked it up to the storm system rumored to be coming in later. \n\nWhen I was about to take my lunch, I grabbed my stuff from the fridge and looked for Trent, so I could let him know what was up.\n\n‚ÄúTrent?‚Äù I called out. \n\nNo response. \n\n‚ÄúTrent?‚Äù I raised my voice louder. \n\nStill no response. \n\nI started walking around to look for him. He wasn‚Äôt anywhere in the ranger station, but he couldn‚Äôt have gone far. I had no reason to think anything was amiss, but after finding the RV, I was a tiny bit wary. Because even after all these years, I couldn‚Äôt shake the old feelings that anyone raised around here inherited from a thousand campfire stories. And they all had the same message; be careful of the swamps, or better yet, stay out altogether. Part of it is just tradition. For centuries, people warned others about venturing into a swamp. And as someone who has spent a lot of time in one as part of his job, I won‚Äôt deny that a swamp can seem a bit otherworldly at times. Especially if it‚Äôs a huge one filled with water. It‚Äôs certainly captivating, but it can also be a bit overwhelming. Because if the woods can be both majestic and intimidating, a swamp is in a whole league of it‚Äôs own. There‚Äôs nothing like being in a boat and seeing an alligator sitting or swimming nearby. And there‚Äôs certainly nothing like being out here at night, and seeing nothing, but hearing a huge splash in the water. \n\nI stepped back outside into the thick humidity and called Trent‚Äôs name again.\n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù That was when he came around the side and looked at me. \n\n‚ÄúThere you are.‚Äù I sighed. ‚ÄúI just wanted to tell you I‚Äôm grabbing my lunch.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúOh. Thanks. I‚Äôll grab mine too if you don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúNot at all.‚Äù \n\nI turned and held the door as he stepped inside and I followed. He grabbed his lunch, and we settled down. \n\n‚ÄúI stepped outside for a moment because I thought I saw someone lingering outside,‚Äù he said before he took a bite of his sandwich.\n\n‚ÄúAnd did you?‚Äù I asked while I used my fork to scoop up some potato salad.\n\n‚ÄúNo, but I swear I thought someone was out there. Watching us from down the road.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúIt happens.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúYeah. That RV we found is creepy.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúSure is.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúAll the info is going to the appropriate agencies, to see if they‚Äôre looking for anything like it. If they are, they‚Äôll take it, and if not, it‚Äôll be disposed of. Either way, I won‚Äôt be sorry to see it gone. The smell alone is awful. I‚Äôve never smelled anything like that in my life, and you know I‚Äôve spent my entire life outdoors and in nature.‚Äù \n\nI nodded. ‚ÄúI do.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve smelled plenty of bad stuff, but that was different.‚Äù He paused while he picked up a few potato chips. ‚ÄúThis is gonna sound weird, but I don‚Äôt feel good after being around it. Not like I feel ill or something, but like I feel off. Know what I mean?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù \n\nTrent leaned in closer, like he was worried about being overheard. ‚ÄúDo you feel the same way?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúA little bit. I don‚Äôt disagree that thing was beyond disturbing. Something about it just rubbed me the wrong way. It‚Äôs all too weird.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúExactly. Listen, I don‚Äôt blame you for being a little nervous when you couldn‚Äôt find me. So let‚Äôs stick together for the rest of the day. No going anywhere alone. Just as a precaution.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúSounds good to me.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúCool.‚Äù \n\nSo we did just that for the rest of the day, which turned out to be slow and uneventful. But as we were closing up to leave, the storm that had been lingering finally started, and rain started to come down in thick sheets. \n\nTrent and I briefly looked at it before we glanced back at each other. \n\n‚ÄúWell, hope you have a good night,‚Äù he said. \n\n‚ÄúYou too. Drive carefully.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúYou as well.‚Äù \n\nThen we both ran to our respective cars, started them up, and pulled out of the lot and down the road. I was in the lead, and when I reached the road, I took a left, Trent went to the right, and we each gave the other a farewell honk before parting ways. \n\nThe rain came down in heavy waves, and in no time at all, the road was drenched. It came down heavily for about 15 minutes, which meant it had lightened up considerably by the time I got home. As I opened my window to use my pass to get inside, the smell of fresh rain hit me, and I felt immediately invigorated. The humidity had also considerably lessened, which meant it felt like it was at least 15 degrees colder from earlier. \n\nWhen the gate to my apartment building opened, I pulled into the garage, and parked in my reserved spot. Then I headed to the elevator and rode it to my apartment, which was on the fifth floor. Once inside, I flipped on the TV. After about an hour of that, I heated up some leftover chicken and mashed potatoes while I watched a movie. Although the rain had slowed down somewhat from earlier, it still came down steadily all night, so it pounded on the building in a rhythm I‚Äôve always found calming. \n\nSince I was in the mood for some ice cream, I eventually headed to the kitchen to grab some from the freezer, and on a whim, I decided to look outside the window. My kitchen overlooks the main road, and it gleamed in the night on account of the rain. There were several street lights outside, which gave the area some illumination. \n\nI was just about to turn around and get my ice cream when I saw it. From across the street, near an abandoned strip mall, stood a figure. I couldn‚Äôt make out exactly who it was, but the shape was tall, in all black, and stood there watching my apartment. It was the last one that unsettled me. The figure stood there, looking straight up at my apartment. I had no idea if I‚Äôd been seen, but it didn‚Äôt matter to me. The only clothing I could make out was a jacket complete with a black hood, which was hiding the face of whoever it was. \n\nI took a deep breath and tried to think logically, while ignoring the panic flooding through my body. After a minute or two, I took out my phone, and dialed the only number I could think of. \n\n‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs watching your apartment,‚Äù Trent said without hesitation when he answered. \n\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù My stomach clenched as he spoke. Because I knew what it meant. ‚ÄúSame thing there?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúYeah. Just standing there, watching.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúSame here.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúWhat do we do?‚Äù \n\nHe paused. ‚ÄúWhat can we do? Nothing‚Äôs going on. So all we can do is sit and watch, and if something happens, act accordingly.‚Äù\n\nTrent was right. Nothing was going on. And I was never more thankful I lived in an apartment building on the fifth floor. \n\n‚ÄúI suppose I should say good luck.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúYou too. You know where to find me in case.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLikewise.‚Äù \n\nThen I hung up. Then I grabbed my chair, set it up, and watched. And watched. And watched some more. But the figure didn‚Äôt do anything. Didn‚Äôt even seem to move. Eventually, I dozed off, but woke up several hours later, having temporarily forgotten what I was doing and why I was sitting there. \n\nThe figure was gone. I didn‚Äôt know if that was good or bad. So I quickly got up and went to every window to look around. Nothing there either. Then I called Trent. \n\nHe answered on the second ring. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúWhoever it was is gone.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúReally?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo sign of anything or anyone anywhere. What about you?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúA semi-truck just drove past and blocked everything from view. Give me a moment.‚Äù Then I heard a sharp intake of breath. ‚ÄúNothing here either.‚Äù \n\nThen I heard him move around, no doubt to check the other windows. \n\n‚ÄúNothing?‚Äù I asked after a minute. \n\n‚ÄúNo. All gone.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúNice. Well, I suppose we should try to get some sleep. But you know where to find me.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúBack at ya. Goodnight.‚Äù \n\nThen I headed to bed, taking care to put my phone close by. To my surprise, I actually slept well. So well, I almost forgot what had happened and drove to work in a good mood. The rain was gone, and everything felt crisp and bright. When I saw Trent at the coffee shop we both stop at before work, he had the same upbeat attitude.  \n\nBut then we arrived at the park and saw numerous fire department vehicles around. Once we showed our IDs, we were let in, and it didn‚Äôt take us long to find Perry, our boss, lurking around the station with the other rangers. Perry approached us with a weary expression. The smoke was dense, and the entire place smelled like ash. \n\n‚ÄúSomeone made the call early this morning at about 3. Smelled smoke, and they figured out it was coming from here. That old RV you guys found? Someone set it on fire late last night. Dumped gasoline on it and lit a match. All that‚Äôs left is a few bits of metal and a lot of ash.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding,‚Äù Trent said. \n\nPerry shook his head. ‚ÄúWe have some camera footage of a figure or two in black walking around, but that‚Äôs it. The funny thing is, we heard back, and no one needs the RV for anything. Not in connection with any important matter. We might as well head inside. It‚Äôll be a while.‚Äù \n\nWe followed Perry inside the ranger station, and once he headed to his office, we saw Max and a few others who had been there yesterday, and they looked exhausted. And Trent and I both said so. \n\n‚ÄúI had the worst night‚Äôs sleep ever.‚Äù Max mumbled while rubbing his eyes. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt get comfortable, and every time I did doze off, I had weird hazy dreams. Can‚Äôt remember anything, except I woke up nervous and panting. Like I‚Äôd been running from something.‚Äù \n\nFrom the expressions on their face, I could tell without asking that the others had a similar experience. \n\n‚ÄúOh well,‚Äù Max continued. ‚ÄúAnd between us, I‚Äôm not too upset about someone using that RV as firewood.‚Äù \n\nI nodded. ‚ÄúMe either.‚Äù",

        "text": "I never thought of myself posting here, but I have a story to share with you guys; just promise me that you‚Äôre not going to laugh. There‚Äôs not a lot I know about this situation, and I can‚Äôt process anything, so if I have bad English or anything else, I apologize. I‚Äôm shaking right now, so I can hardly write, but here‚Äôs a sentence to describe it to you, and it‚Äôs not very good.\n\nSo, you know those shows we like to watch on television? like SpongeBob SquarePants, The Amazing World of Gumball, and others? I‚Äôm bringing these shows up because these are examples of shows that you and I used to watch. Have you never found anything weird or creepy about these shows? Admit it, you certainly did, and I did too, but it wasn't as bad as others think; it was just for the comedy.\n\nAside from those shows, let‚Äôs get to the story I‚Äôm about to tell you all. Again, I‚Äôm sorry if I don‚Äôt describe my thoughts and feelings about this; this show just fills me with dread, anyway. Here goes nothing.\n\nIn late November, I inherited a home and was in the process of clearing out what was left of the estate of my great-aunt, who had passed away, when I stumbled upon a very odd DVD of an obscure show. The box was badly damaged, but the disc was in a seemingly perfect condition. The mystery had piqued my interest, so I loaded it up in my DVD player to check it out. There were no problems with starting the DVD, except for a black screen that lasted for 30 seconds.\n\nAfter about 30 seconds, the text \"Sammy the Cat\" slowly rolled across the screen, followed by the year 2019 in a smaller font. This was dumbfounding because my great-aunt passed away in 2020, and we were only recently granted access to her estate. I‚Äôm told many of these DVDs were watched by a child she would babysit when she still lived at home. She was at a nursing home from 2017 until her passing; I was interrupted, and the show continues.\n\nAfter the title card, the screen quickly fades into white; the white fades into a shot of a lightly furnished, mostly empty room with a door to the left. Rather quickly, however, a large cat enters the frame. The cat is prominently white but has black patches and spots. The screen was very blurry, so it's extremely hard to make out, but it appears to be a person in a cat costume. As it turns around, I notice the large cheeks, googly eyes, and stitches on the front portion of his body; the odd proportions of the costume lead me to believe it to be homemade. After turning around, the cat proceeds to stare in the direction of the camera for what felt like minutes until, again, the screen goes white, which lasts for a good minute.\n\nAfter a few minutes of white screen, the costumed man is seen eating from a bowl‚Äîa bowl of what appears to be raw meat. The source is unknown; I will leave it up to you to determine what the meat is. After emptying the bowl, the man leaves the frame, only to return about 30 seconds later holding the hand of a masked woman. The woman was silent and frozen, and I‚Äôd almost assume she was unconscious if not for her footsteps alongside him. The man leads her to the bedside and sits her down. He sits down next to her, until he eventually starts to shake, and the shakes start to get worse and more aggressive, and the man is now slightly turned away from the woman and is, once again, sitting completely still. This must have lasted for multiple minutes until he reached back and grabbed the woman by the neck. The woman lets out a blood-curdling scream that is so loud that the camera audio struggles to pick it up, and the man covers his ears and starts yelling. The man stands up, also pulling her up involuntarily. The woman is dragged by her neck and then dropped.\n\nBy this point, my heart is racing, and I am confused and in shock at what I am afraid I‚Äôve found. This felt too real and unhinged to be some indie film, but filled with dread, I continued to watch it unfold. Little do I know, however, that I will soon wish I‚Äôd turned it off.\n\nAfter dropping the woman, the man frantically runs through a door to the left side of the main room, perhaps a small closet, because his right leg is still sticking out. When inside, he shuffles around for about 10‚Äì20 seconds until he suddenly turns around to reveal a long-barreled shotgun pointed directly toward the woman. The woman, still blindfolded, is sitting on the floor, unsettlingly silent. There is an overwhelming sense of hopelessness that flows through my body as I watch her exist, completely oblivious to what‚Äôs pointed at her. She isn‚Äôt allowed to see it coming. After standing for a moment, the man lowers the gun and casually walks over to the camera and turns it off. The screen goes dark, and that is the last of the contents of the DVD. The woman was presumably killed in this scene because I heard a gunshot during it, and what followed was the blood-curdling scream of the woman; the show then ended.\n\nAfter the show ended, after a few days of boredom and some hesitation, I decided to report the disc to the local police department. They took it for evidence, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I‚Äôd heard anything back. I became concerned about what had happened to the woman, and I would prefer the closure of knowing rather than the uneasy ignorance that I've been living in for the past few weeks. I've been terrified of something I hoped wasn't true but was afraid might be. It was eating me alive, so yesterday I decided to reach back into the box where I found the original disc because I knew I hadn‚Äôt looked very thoroughly the first time. After anxiously sifting for about 30 seconds, a convulsive shock is delivered through my entire body when I see it. To my dismay, I spotted yet another unlabeled, damaged disc container sitting along the border of the box, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to touch it, much less open it, and ever since then, I‚Äôve been feeling uneasy. I‚Äôve thought about disposing of it so I don‚Äôt have to deal with it, but I don‚Äôt want to get rid of something that may potentially be the solution to a case. However, there was more than I thought.\n\nWithout hesitation, I grabbed the DVD and inserted the damaged disc. I was hoping for more evidence, and these were the events that occurred after the first disc: The disc was broken but started with the cat again, and he was talking to a 5-year-old boy, and he asked the boy to follow him to the same blender that was in the previous disc, and he picked up the boy and turned him into a smoothie, and the cat came back to his closet and put the long-barreled shotgun into the closet, letting out a huge sigh as though he regretted what he'd done, and the entire thing was cut, and the DVD ends.\n\nI started questioning this show and the fact that this man didn't even put it in the nearby shop for DVDs except for my great-aunt‚Äôs house that I inherited, and I can understand why. It seems very unrealistic for some anonymous person to put their snuff film in a public store for others to watch. I turned off the DVD, took it out of my player, and reported it to the police department. I shared some evidence with them, and I have many questions after sharing the evidence.\n\nThis is up to you to answer: who was the man in the cat costume, and is the man related to my great aunt, and why was he killing people? I will allow you to figure it out; as for the second DVD, I ended up reporting it to the police as well. Upon again visiting the PD, I found out he was already serving time in prison on unrelated charges. They are now investigating the content of the second DVD of the show.\n\nAs for the man, I hope he stays away from me and never steps foot near this house again.\n\nThis is the end of this post.",

        "text": "  \n\nI don‚Äôt know why I went to Mount Rainer . . .\n\nI mean, I know *what* I went to Mount Rainer for, but to this day I don‚Äôt really know *why* I felt so compelled to go. \n\nI‚Äôve always been ‚ÄúObsessively curious‚Äù. I think that‚Äôs probably the best way to describe it. I get these fascinations for things out of seemingly nowhere, and once that fascination lodges itself in my head it quickly starts to take over every waking aspect of my life It seems. Thinking about it turns into reading about it, reading about it turns into researching it as thoroughly as possible, research leads to investigation, and the rabbit hole of my obsessions just goes and goes, and then as suddenly as this obsession starts. It‚Äôs gone. Complete and total disinterest, just like that. \n\nEver since I was a kid it‚Äôs been this way. I kind of compare it to an itch, and ultimately the only way to really stop an itch is to scratch it. Right?\n\nI remember laying on my couch on a rainy off day from work and scrolling through YouTube while I waited for the Dominos guy to drop off some buffalo wings when a strange title I‚Äôd never heard of came up and caught my eye. \n\n**Missing 411: Strange and Unexplained Disappearances In Americas National Parks.**\n\nAs soon as I clicked on that video, I knew I‚Äôd found my newest obsession. The Dyatlov pass incident I had been researching for months now was gone and out the window. \n\nHindsight‚Äôs always 20/20, as the saying goes. I had no idea that I was about to set an unchangeable course that led me to the horrifying reality I was soon to discover.  .  .\n\nThree weeks and probably a hundred videos, a handful of ordered books, and an endless scrolling through every forum and internet thread I could get my hands on, and I was still just as enamored with these ‚ÄúMissing 411‚Äôs‚Äù as I‚Äôd been when I first clicked on that initial YouTube video. \n\nI‚Äôd be genuinely surprised if there were a lot of people reading this who didn‚Äôt know about David Paulides, the missing 411s, and all of confounding mysteriousness that surrounded these matters, but for those who might be out of the loop I‚Äôll do my best to sum it up in few little bullet points for you. Cliff notes or whatever. \n\nI. There have been a disturbingly large number of unexplained disappearances in Americas‚Äô national parks, and by large number I mean two THOUSAND. That‚Äôs more than everyone in the North tower on 9/11. 2,000 people just vanishing in the woods with no explanation whatsoever.\n\nII. A lot of these people are never seen/ heard from again. That in its own right is insane given the technologies that we have, and the massive searches that are sometimes carried out for these people, but what‚Äôs even weirder is that the people that are eventually found leave us more questions than answers. Kids go missing and are found miles and miles away from the initial search zone. Way further than even top survival experts are able to walk. People‚Äôs bodies turn up in super obvious areas that have been searched multiple times by search and rescue teams. Search dogs will have a good obvious trail on the missing person and then just lose it. Sometimes all they find are the person‚Äôs shoes, sometimes they find the person with no shoes at all, sometimes the bodies look like they‚Äôve fallen from a great height despite there being no high ground to fall off of. Etc.\n\nIII. The number of times military units have been deployed to go and search for missing people is eyebrow raising to say the least. The military is very effective, but they‚Äôre not search and rescue. They‚Äôre trained to seek and destroy, not really search and save. \n\nIV. The National Park service gets very, VERY sketchy when it comes to any kind of further inquiry. This has led a lot of people to believe that they‚Äôre covering something up.\n\nNow, me being the obsessive person that I am immediately started trying to sleuth around for some kind of conclusion. What was the overall theory? What did people think was going on here? I guess because the speculation can go on forever. The theories go on forever too. Everything from rich megalomaniacs on ‚ÄúHunting trips‚Äù, Aliens, Wendigos and Skinwalkers, Aliens, Bigfoot abductions, parallel universes. The list is truly endless. So many different theories, and as wild as some of them might sound at first. It‚Äôs beyond eerie how quickly they begin to sound more than rational, and even possible with just a little bit of explanation.\n\nBut as I poured through the seemingly endless accounts and rumors. There was one theory that hit a stronger chord with me than the rest.\n\nFeral people . . .\n\nIn a nutshell, the theory is that during the Great Depression, maybe even earlier. People took off with their families deep into these wilderness regions to live off the land and get away from the crippling poverty of the cities and towns during that time. Generations of incest and isolation resulted in their ancestors being what we would consider ‚ÄúFeral‚Äù completely hostile, incapable of reasoning that we can comprehend, with a multi-generational knowledge of the land they lived in and how to survive it. Paired with a relatively untouched (Government protected after all) access to a virtually endless number of resources. Other humans. If the opportunity presented itself. Could not only be a decent food opportunity, but they were also food opportunity with extremely valuable tools just ripe for taking. Like cereal with a fuckin prize in the box Can you imagine how valuable a water bottle would be to a caveman? How wildly priceless a fishing pole would look? The national park service knows about these feral people, but they also know it‚Äôd be a huge risk to go traipsing in the wilderness looking for bloodthirsty cannibals that are more competent and dangerous than even the most apex predators they live with. They also provide an extremely valuable insight for scientists to study all sorts of things about human nature, but from time to time they get a little too close, or they get to bold and give their locations away, the military gets called in to dispose of these ‚Äòtribes‚Äô in a discreet and efficient manner before more people disappear, and as a result more people take to the woods to find their missing people.\n\nFor whatever reason this theory made perfect sense to me . . . Well, almost perfect sense. It checked almost all the boxes. Children and elderly people go missing because they‚Äôre the easiest to overpower. Hikers who are by themselves go missing because they‚Äôre by themselves and can be ambushed quicker than a group of hikers could, Hunters go missing because they‚Äôre far off the beaten path, and they have weapons that are worth the risk. It even explains why bow hunters tend to go missing more than gun hunters. Bows are easier to figure out, and lower matinence. We already know people go missing without a trace and are never found again. Would it be so wild to say in the same breath that people are never found in the first place for the same reasons? \n\nEven most of your ‚ÄúBigfoot‚Äù sightings in these national parks could be explained with the feral people theory. Imagine what you would look like if you had never had a haircut, if you‚Äôd never taken a shower, or clipped your nails, or combed your hair or shaved your beard. Throw a Hapsburg jaw or a heavy brow in the mix from years of intrafamilial breeding and you‚Äôre pretty much the perfect definition of a sasquatch at that point.\n\nBut for all the information and cross examinations that I would read about to seemingly prove this theory. There were admittedly a few glaring loopholes that with a bit more thought would very quickly start to pull the whole idea apart. \n\nHumans are truly a scourge on this planet. Anywhere we go we leave a mess, we make smoke from fires, we burn things down accidentally, we cut down trees and leave bones lying all over the place. The very steps we take kill the forest floor. Leaving huge patches of dirt wherever we stay for more than a few days. We are hands down the easiest animal to find. Every human that‚Äôs ever walked the earth inherently believes that the earth is theirs. I guess that manifests even in the most unconscious of ways.\n\nNot to mention the scientific probabilities; infertility that comes with incest. Crippling genetic mutations, etc. For all the positive evidence I‚Äôll be the first to admit there were some serious holes in the theory. \n\nSo around and around I went with this concept. For months. Ruling it in and ruling it out. Until one day I was given what I can only describe as a divine revelation. Like the conspiracy Gods took pity on my slow decay into insanity and threw me a nice big bone to chew on, and this one actually had some meat on it. . . \n\nI had fallen asleep on the couch amidst another bout of determined research. YouTube was once again in the background. When I woke up from my nap I went for the remote when the narrator of the video caught my attention. Missing 411‚Äôs had rabbit holed into unexplained mysteries in general, and unexplained mysteries had rabbit holed into crazy discoveries made by scientists and historians.\n\nThe narrator was talking about this skull that had been found. The picture of it was posted up for the viewer to see while he talked about it. It was an old weathered looking skull that had puncture holes in the cranium part, because of these holes scientists thought for a long time that this child had been the victim of a human sacrifice, but through a series of discoveries it was made apparent that this child in actuality had been picked clean off the ground by a Crowned eagle.\n\nSuddenly it hit me. I sprang out of my seat like a mad man as all the pieces began to fall together like an arubix cube that was all but solving itself. \n\nGiant. Fucking. Eagles!\n\nI know, I know. It sounds ridiculous. On the surface more ridiculous than any other theory brought forward, but like my dad always said, the difference between batshit and guano is the stuff that‚Äôs inside it, and this was no different. \n\nI‚Äôm not going to get into every painful detail here, but I do have to point out a few just to show you where I‚Äôm coming from here. \n\nI. Eagles eat take- out. They swoop in. Snatch and kill their food, fly it back, and eat in the nest. This explains why people go missing and are never found again. They‚Äôre being looked for somewhere on the forest floor. When they‚Äôve actually been carried up a mountain and dropped in a nest somewhere. This also explains why the people who are found are way further out than they by all rights should be, and why so many seem to have fallen from a great height. The eagle takes someone who‚Äôs a little too heavy, takes someone who doesn‚Äôt die right away and squirms a bit too much, gets spooked or startled and needs to fly faster, and they drop their meal.\n\nII. Eagles are ambush predators. They hang out on a perch, and as soon as they see a tasty snack, they swoop in pin it down, kill it, then swoop back with their newly acquired meal to wherever it is they nest at. This explains why so many lone hikers go missing off a trail. Just like a hunter would babysit a game trail for deer, an eagle babysits a foot path for humans, and speaking of deer . . .\n\nIII. An eagle large enough to swoop up with a human would more than likely have a reliable food source of deer, and there are a crap ton of deer. In Yellowstone alone there are over 2,000 mule deer running around, and that‚Äôs just mule deer, and this is the very reason why hunters go missing. If you‚Äôre out hunting a deer then chances are you‚Äôre wearing scents, and making deer calls. In other words, you are actively trying to convince deer that you are in fact, also a deer, but the same artificial smells and bleats that would attract a nice big ten point would just as easily be a ‚ÄúFREE FOOD‚Äù sign for a large bird of prey.\n\nIV. This also explains why so many times only aspects of the missing person have been found. Shoes, backpacks, cameras, hiking sticks, bows, etc. Eagles are smart creatures. They probably learned pretty quickly that there‚Äôs a lot of stuff on these humans that aren‚Äôt edible. Clothing can be torn through easily enough, but the thicker more durable stuff gets ripped off and discarded. Like a deer‚Äôs antlers. The feet are torn off by the ankles and smaller animals eat whatever is left inside. \n\nNow, I know if you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôre probably thinking one glaring thing. \n\n‚ÄúCome on Saint\\_Circa. You‚Äôd think someone would notice Giant eagles flying around.‚Äù \n\nBut they have. \n\nThat‚Äôs why the National Park Service gets so shady when people try to investigate further. They are well aware that there are giant eagles living in the hundreds of miles these national parks reach out to sometimes, and considering eagles only hunt in a roughly 15‚Äì20-mile perimeter around their nests. They know exactly where to find them as well.\n\nAmericas National bird is the Bald Eagle. It‚Äôs been that way since 1782. By 1963 there were only 400 nesting pairs of bald eagles in the entire country. Why? Because people shot them out of the sky in droves. Not for their meat, not for their valuable talons or beaks. Researchers say that these eagles were killed mainly to ‚ÄúSee them up close.‚Äù That‚Äôs it. Do you think for half a second there wouldn‚Äôt be a thousand hillbillies with birdshot scouring the entire countryside the second it was discovered that there were giant eagles flying around??  My best guess is that the National Park service works in tandem with wildlife conservationist groups to keep these endangered animals as secret as possible, but you can‚Äôt just let giant man-eating eagles fuck each other willy nilly and fly around eating whatever they want whenever they feel like. No one‚Äôs going to go spend money to hang out at a natural park they‚Äôll be killed and eaten at. That‚Äôd be horrible for business.\n\nIn comes the military. \n\nYou see. It‚Äôs not just ‚ÄúThe military‚Äù that‚Äôs sent out to find these missing people. It‚Äôs one particularly small, but highly effective section of the military, and that section is the Green Berets. Green Berets have a large set of skills, but two of their main purposes are ‚ÄúSpecial Reconnaissance‚Äù and ‚ÄúUnconventional warfare.‚Äù And almost all their operations fall under the category of ‚ÄúClassified.‚Äù\n\nIn layman‚Äôs terms. They specialize in ‚ÄúFinding things, and reporting information on it.‚Äù And ‚ÄúKilling things in very unique and creative ways.‚Äù And then of course they‚Äôre not allowed to talk about any of it. Total secrecy. \n\nYou think these guys get called out because Tiny Tim got turned around in the woods? Bullshit. The government can‚Äôt even send a real HazMat team to Palestine Ohio when a chemical fire radiates the entire town. No, they go out there when park rangers suspect Tiny Tim got turned into a giant eagle‚Äôs lunch, and they need the best of the best to identify If that is indeed the case and take it down/ dispose of it properly if it is, and keep their mouths shut about it afterwards. They get sent out when scientists speculate that the giant eagle population has grown too high and is risking compromise. The green berets go out and depopulate a bit. Keep the population under control, and keep their mouths shut about it afterwards. They get sent out when one dies so they can collect the body for research, and keep their mouths shut about it afterwards.\n\nI was absolutely sure of it, but even after this certainty cemented itself into everything else I knew to be true. A new dangerous itch began to invade the back of my mind. You can‚Äôt just ‚ÄúKnow‚Äù that a house is haunted. You have to actually see the fucking ghost, don‚Äôt you? I fought it for longer than I thought possible, but within seven months of watching that first video I found myself driving to Mount Rainer. I had to complete the experiment. I had to be sure that I was sure that I was sure. \n\nHow‚Äôs that song go? The old 80s one? \n\n*Blinded with Science!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTook forever to plan the trip. I‚Äôd already been spending weeks studying things about eagles, but now I had to reorient and study how to spot eagles. When they hunted, how to watch them without spooking them etc. \n\nBut after four deep diving months I had my plan, and everything I needed to carry it out.\n\nI chose Mount Rainer for two reasons. The first being it was close, the second being that there have been an unusual number of disappearances not only on the mountain itself, but in the entirety of the national park that surrounded it. Even by National Park Standards. \n\nIn the small hours of the morning, as the sun was just beginning to rise. I took off down the trail and began looking for the perfect spot to set up my blind. \n\nSee normal eagles hang out in big trees, or on the sides of cliffs, but my hypothesis was that a giant eagle would probably be hanging out in crevices against cliffs. When something it could eat walked into its radar it would swoop out and ambush it. About four hours into my trip, I found a spot I thought was ideal. A small hilltop with trees, but not too many trees. At the bottom of the hill to my left a large cliff wall could be seen. To the right was relatively flat land with enough space in between for a large bird to fly through unhindered. \n\nAnd so, I waited, and waited, and waited. For three days I sat in that fucking blind. Watching the deer. Eating cold MRES and trying my hardest not to doze off. \n\nAt the beginning of day four, however, it would all change. I was just considering leaving. When you‚Äôre alone in a ramshackle tent it doesn‚Äôt take long for your mind to convince you of what an idiot you are. Giant eagles? Come on Saint\\_Circa, look at all the time you‚Äôve wasted. Why can‚Äôt you get hooked on something productive? As a big 10 point stepped out of the brush into the area just in front of me, I watched it with a sort of boredom. Deer are cool the first time you see one, but this had to have been the 100th deer in three days that I‚Äôd seen, and at the end of the day they‚Äôre just horses with antlers. They mosey, they eat. They poop and leave. \n\nI guess in my boredom I didn‚Äôt really notice how quiet the forest had gotten. The deer did though. It stopped mid bite and perked its head up, locked rigidly into place with a big mess of grass hanging out of its mouth.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs when it happened. \n\nIt was so fast my mind hardly had time to process it. One moment the deer was standing there, and the next it was pinned to the ground. I sat there wide eyed and in shock from the hidden barrier of my blind. Standing over this thing was the largest animal I had ever seen. Its huge wingspan seemed to stretch endlessly, it had to have been forty feet from end to end. The forest floor was shaded almost completely as its outstretched wings blotted the sun from the sky. Even without the wings it was almost too large to comprehend. At least eight feet off the ground on its two taloned legs. Its dinosaur-like eyes gazing emptily into its prey like huge orbs of golden fire. \n\nThe poor animal let out one bleated scream before the eagle‚Äôs large beak tore into its neck. Sending streams of blood and tissue across the forest floor like something out of a slasher movie. I could hear bones crunching violently even from the distance I was at. \n\nSuddenly I realized I had to take a photo. No one would believe it if I didn‚Äôt show them firsthand. Even then they‚Äôd have probably thought it was just a hoax. Green screens and CGI and Photoshop, all that shit. I raised the lens of my camera towards the creature with shaking hands and snapped a shot. \n\nHuge . . . huge mistake. \n\nAs soon as the camera made that stupid little fluttering sound the eagles‚Äô head snapped instantly in my direction. It‚Äôs lifeless eyes staring with pure instinct straight through the camouflage of my structure. It saw me. Before I could react, there was a sharp blast of wind. In less than a moment the entire blind was ripped off of its stakes and thrown into the woods around me. As I recovered and looked around, panic stricken. I could see the horrible thing tearing into the remnants of the plastic structure some fifteen or twenty feet in front of me. Trying to find me inside of it. With everything I could muster I took off in the direction of my car. I‚Äôve never ran so fast in my life. It took a long time to get back to my car, and the few times a stopped to try and catch my breath or dry-heave I was all but sure would result in me being another missing 411 on Mount Rainer. After what felt like days of almost endless running, I made it back to my car. Exhausted and frightened for my life.\n\nAs I sat in the driver‚Äôs seat of my car hyperventilating from exhaustion and weeping from fear I couldn‚Äôt wrap my mind around what I‚Äôd just witnessed, or how I was still here to think about it. The only thing I could think about was getting the hell as far away from Mount Rainer as possible. As I made the long drive home, and my thoughts began to somewhat return to me I concluded that the eagle must‚Äôve gotten itself trapped in the blind just long enough for me to get away. It was either that or the deer it had killed had way more meat than I did, and it was already dead. I guess it‚Äôd be pointless to chase a smaller prey. Eagles are wicked smart after all. \n\nI tried to contact several authorities afterwards, but surprise surprise. No one believed it. \n\n‚ÄúYou know sir, Eagles are a lot bigger than people initially think they are.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAre you sure you weren‚Äôt using any illegal substances?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOkay, well we‚Äôll send someone out to look at it and tell you what we find. . . Uh huh, we‚Äôll let you know if we find anything. We‚Äôll let you know. ‚Äú\n\nThat camera is still out there in the woods with the rest of my stuff . . . I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever be brave enough to try and go back for it. Maybe someone will find it and the truth will be that much harder to dismiss.\n\nFor now, I only have you guys to tell. \n\nThe National Park is hiding something big in the mountains and forests of the United States, and if you ever go hiking in one of these remote places. Make sure you are never alone.",

        "text": "Growing up in Arizona, myths and legends are a part of life. Native traditions, mystic places, vortexes, ufo abductions, and dozens of other stories of the unknown that I always found fascinating. I grew up spending a lot of time wandering around the desert and the mountains, hunting, camping etc so I felt very at home in the wilderness. \n\nOne late spring day on one of my many hiking adventures, I wandered off trail and after several hours came upon a small group of old mud adobe houses. A few people heard me coming and came out of the houses to investigate, and after apparently making the collective decision that I was not a threat, one of the elders dressed in old style traditional native clothing and a headdress came over to greet me. The man spoke slowly and told me that I had wandered onto a Navajo reservation and asked me if I was lost, or if I needed help. When I told him no I was lost but intentionally, he chuckled and invited me in to eat with his family. \n\nThe next several hours were one of the great experiences of my life, the whole thing was like being thrown back in time. While we ate and talked, others from the surrounding houses began coming over to join us and I got the feeling they didn't get many outside visitors. We shared stories for hours about life, family, thier history in the area and time spent in the wild, and the longer we talked, the more they opened up and the more interesting the elders stories got. Throughout the time, there was one man who never spoke, he just sat out of the circle listening and watching me. \n\nAt one point, I told them I did what I called my walkabouts every year around September, where I would go out by myself into the wilderness for 2-4 weeks at a time, and this got the attention of the one silent old man. When I finished, he came over to the circle around the fire, sat directly on the ground in front of me and asked me to join him on the ground. He told me that years ago he used to do the same thing, and went on to tell me about the canyon he went to. He described it as a dangerous but magic place, and that I would see the world differently if I came back. If? Must be for dramatif effect. \n\nWhen he finished, he invited me over to his home. The house was small, and through an open door in the back room, I could see it was filled with various animal pelts, coyotes and wolves mostly. He walked over and closed that door, then picked up and handed me an old map and some written directions that seemed like he had been holding on to them for a long time, and just walked away into that back room and closed the door behind him. It was late, and one of the families had invited me to stay the night, which I gladly did. The next morning as I prepared to leave, one of the old women came over to me with something in her hands, handed me a talisman and simply said \"dip your bullets in the white ash at the hottest part of the fire.\" then just walked away. \n\nSeptember came, and as I packed for my walkabout, I saw the talisman in a drawer and something felt right about taking it with me. After a beautiful drive, I was very happy to find the forrest service road marked on the old map. The entrance to the area was remote and overgrown, and tough to get to even in my Jeep and took me much longer to get to than expected, so I decided to make camp and start the hike in the morning. \n\nAfter a few hours on a trail that looked like it had been forgotton, I came to a stream, and the entrance to the secret valley. It was a narrow crack in the tall cliffs with about 4 feet of water running gently through, but too narrow for a kayak or canoe. I hoisted my gear over my head and began the wade sideways through the chest deep water. The crack in the cliffs seemed to go on forever, but after almost two hours I came to the place where it opened up into a small lake in an incredible valley surrounded by tall rock faces. This may have been the most remote place I have ever been, in the sense that there was no sign that people had ever been there. No trash, no bullet casings, not even the evidence of campfires. \n\nMy first night there was the quietest night I have ever spent in the wild, no birds, no frogs, not even crickets, but I didn't feel like I was alone there. In the morning, after breakfast, I headed out on my first exploratory hike to explore my new home for the next couple weeks. After being stalked by a mountain lion on a hike about 10 years ago, I make a point of now bringing a pistol with me when I'm out wilderness hiking. After some looking around, I found a narrow path that appeared to be a game trail that lead up the side of one of the cliffs and towards what looked like caves from the canyon floor. I made my way up to them and came upon an entrance that was much larger than it appeared from below. I made some noise to alert any possible animals I was there, and made my way inside. \n\nThe cave was an expansive single chamber that went back a couple hundred feet. As I walked, I inspected as much as I could see with my light, but there was no tracks of any kind in the dirt besides mine, so I decided I was alone in there and pushed on towards the rear of the cave. As I came around the last bend in the cave and approached the end, my headlamp panned across a large pile of bones, some animal, some human, and a very old looking, small candle sitting on a natural stone shelf. This is the first thing that has scared me in as long as I can remember, but focusing my wits I remembered that there was no other tracks in the cave and figured it was all from a long time ago. \n\nI was still a little uneasy as I exited the cave, and was ready to get back to camp. As I came out into the light, about 75 feet away, there was the largest wolf I have ever seen that looked like it was coming down from standing on it's hind legs. It dropped down to all fours on a rock just began staring at me, not growling or bearing its teeth, just staring. I pulled my .45 and fired two shots of to the side of it to scare it away, but it didn't even flinch. Not only have I never seen a wolf in this part of northern Arizona, but I have never seen a wild animal that did not at least flinch at the sound of a gunshot. We both stood there staring at each other for a moment, I turned and set my backpack down to grab my binoculars and get a little closer look, but when I turned back, the wolf was gone. \n\nI made my way cautiously down the path back towards camp. I have encountered wolves before, and usually it's not the one wolf you can see that should worry you, it's the ones you can't see, so I was extra cautious for the return trip. Back at camp, I made sure my gun was fully loaded, and got my recurve bow strung just in case the wolves came back. I have seen plenty of predatory animals on my adventures, it's a part of being in the wilderness, so I wasn't too worried, just prepared myself the best I could and went over to the lake to go fishing. \n\nWithin about 20 minutes, I caught 2 of the biggest brown trout I've ever caught, so I decided to stop fishing for the day and take a swim. Back at camp, I made a fire, cleaned my trout and made dinner while the sun went down. As soon as the sun went down, all of the life in the canyon seemed to go silent again. As I put out my fire and prepared for bed, I noticed there was a small flicker of light coming from the area where the cave I had explored earlier up the cliffside, which didn't make sense. It was a moonless night, and stars don't reflect that way. It couldn't have been the candle I had seen, it was too old and would not have burned so bright. I decided to keep my gun close and try to get some sleep. I would investigate the cave again the next day. \n\nWhen I woke at sunrise, there was a haze along the ground throughout the whole canyon floor, but as the sun rose it disappeared quickly, and the area came back to life. I made my breakfast, gathered my gun and bow, and headed back up towards the cave. When I reached the entrance, I saw there were still no tracks besides mine around the entrance and decided to push up the hill further. Just a little further up, I came upon the entrance to another cave, much smaller than the first one. There was a small flat landing with a large, heavily twisted juniper tree that to my absolute surprise had many small objects hanging from thin, old looking ropes tied to the branches. There were bones, but there were also old things definitely made by humans, and looked like they were old Native American artifacts. Thinking I might have found the spot where the old man I met on the reservation had stayed when he was there decades ago, I went into the cave. \n\nThis cave was much different from the first one. Just a few feet in, I noticed the walls were covered in what looked like ceremonial cave paintings. As I pushed further back, the cave got dramatically colder, much colder than it should have been, and the walls were completely covered with the paintings the entire way. When I reached the back of the cave, I was not prepared for what I saw. There was what looked like an old altar made of wood and bones. As I looked around, I saw that a little before the back of the cave, there was another shaft in the ceiling that went up, and on a ledge about 25 feet up sat the small figure of what appeared to be a woman. \n\nShe was small and pale with her face painted white, and wearing something like a crown made of woven branches with two small antlers at the front. I stopped and stared for a few minutes, and the figure did not move so I assumed that it was mummified remains from a long time ago. Not wanting to disturb a burial site, I turned to walk back out of the cave, but I began to walk, I heard what sounded like a faint voice in an unknown, ancient language. I instinctively looked back up towards the figure, but it was gone. I was immediately terrified, and ran from the cave as fast as I could get out, but my headlamp flickered and died. I made my way out, feeling along the wall to find my way, and the whole way I felt like there was something right behind me. \n\nWhen I saw the first light from the cave entrance I began to sprint towards it. Just before I made it out, I looked back and there was nothing so I slowed down, but I could still hear the faint voice and the volume never changed. When I got outside, all the bones and artifacts hanging from the tree were gone. I ran down the path as fast as I could, headed back to my campsite by the lake. Just as I reached the floor of the canyon, I noticed the large wolf at the treeline to my left, but this time it stayed standing upright on it's hind legs. I stopped running, hoping to not initiate it's preditory response to chase me, and again, it just stood ther staring at me. \n\nI reached my campsite safely and immediately began packing up. It was too late in the day to make it out before dark, and I did not want to make the hike out at night with all that was going on. I moved my tent so it would back up to the canyon wall by the crack in the cliffside so I didn't have to worry about anything sneaking up behind me. I built my fire much larger and knew I wasn't going to get any sleep that night. \n\nJust as the sun was going down, I began to hear noises coming from the trees, and I felt like I was being hunted. Finally, in the last light of day, I saw the wolf slowly walking around by where the path lead out of the trees and it began to slowly walk towards me. This time I drew my gun and fired towards the creature intending to hit it, and while I saw a couple hit the dirt around it, several bullets hit it. Several rounds from a .45 will at least slow down anything I've ever encountered, but this giant wolf kept walking towards me like nothing had happened. I continued to fire at it until the inevitable click of an empty magazine. \n\nI reached down and fumbled around in my backpack looking for my other magazines to reload, and as I lifted it, the talisman the old woman gave me fell out onto the ground. I picked it up and put it around my neck and immediately remembered what she had told me; \"dip your bullets in the white ash\". I looked around, but didn't see my backup magazines, so I grabbed my bow, pulled an arrow that was tipped with a hunting broadhead and dipped it into the white ashes, drew and fired. I hit the creature just in front of it's right hip and it let out a noise somewhere between a growl and a person screaming that made my blood curdle, I can hear that noise in my head to this day. It immediately turned and ran back to the trees, and in the flicker of the fire light I saw the small women with the antler crown standing there waiting for it. \n\nThey both retreated into the trees and for the rest of the night, I could hear the same faint voice I had heard in the cave. I spent the night outside of my tent, as awake as I have ever been, but no longer afraid and at dawn finished packing up so I could get out of that canyon. \n\nThe next spring, I went back to the small group of houses on the Navajo reservation I had found the year before. I was wearing the talisman as a necklace, and the first person to greet me was the woman who had given it to me and she ran up to give me a big hug. \"You heard me.\" was all she said. I asked the group about the man who had given me the map as I was almost desperate to talk to him about the experience I had so I could compare it to his own. They told me that he had disappeared shortly after I had visited them the first time and had not been back. Strangely, when I tried to tell them what had happened to me, no one would let me tell the story, and the oldest man there who sat in the corner kept mumbling the words \"yee naaldlooshii\". \n\nWe all once again sat and shared other stories of life and a meal. Before I left the next morning, I found the old woman who had given me the talisman and offered it back to her. She smiled and told me I had a good heart, then just closed my hands around it telling me to keep it to watch over my next walkabout. I went back to that small villiage on the reservation several times over the next 10 years or so till I moved to Oregon, but they never let me tell them what happened. I never went back to the canyon and while curiosity sometimes gets the best of me, I don't think I ever will.",

        "text": "  \n\nI‚Äôm not proud of it but yeah, early in college, I drove home plenty of times while impaired. Sometimes I would wake up not knowing how I got home. I was out of control. I never drank in high school so when I started living on campus, I had the freedom and curiosity to explore the hazy, mind-boggled world of constant inebriation. Beer, liquor, beer mixed with liquor, liquor chased with soda, funnels full of beer, funnels full of beer with a shot of vodka, every possible combination imaginable, cooked up in a dorm room full of brain-dead engineers and at least one English major. \n\nOne night I was driving home from a house party. We first went to a little dive bar to see a local band, the drummer whom we knew, was in our Political Science class. After the bar, we went back to my friend‚Äôs house. He was a local, who commuted to the campus. His family owned a tire store, and they were more than middle-class well off. Their house was a gorgeous cabin with dark exterior wood, but the inside was white pine, the contrast was shocking when you first stepped through the front door. I left the party about one in the morning. I wasn‚Äôt smashed, but I damn sure wasn‚Äôt in any state to drive. I didn‚Äôt know the area too well and missed the right turn I was supposed to take to get back to the interstate. The right turn lane was a yield lane, so I thought it would be fine just to wait on the green light and turn from the straight lane. As the light flashed green and I made my right-hand turn blue lights began to flash. I hadn‚Äôt even noticed but on the opposite side of the intersection was a police car. \n\nI pulled over onto the shoulder of the road, while at the same time trying to gather my composure. I was already chewing on some cinnamon gum, but to be safe I unwrapped a couple more pieces and shoved them into my mouth.\n\n‚ÄúLicense and registration.‚Äù It was a female cop. I couldn‚Äôt really see her with the flashlight shining in my face and the lights from the squad car flooding through my back window. So many lights.\n\n‚ÄúYes mam.‚Äù After I fumbled through the glove compartment, I handed her my crumpled-up registration and got my license out of my wallet. \n\nShe went back to her squad car and sat there for a while. I remember thinking that I‚Äôve never had a warrant out on me before and this was taking a while. Had I been an asshole to someone, enough to want me arrested. Finally, she came back to my car. \n\n‚ÄúHave you been drinking tonight?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI had two, maybe three beers earlier tonight.‚Äù A slight underestimation. \n\n‚ÄúCould you step out of the car?‚Äù\n\nI don‚Äôt remember everything I had to do, but she administered a field sobriety test, which I felt like I passed with ease. I was actually surprised at myself, because I was a little unbalanced when I got in the car earlier that night. When we finished, she started talking. I‚Äôm not for sure what she was saying. My attention had been captured by something in the woods behind her. I heard a flutter of wings and then a blast of white light sped towards the officer, hitting her in the back. \n\n‚ÄúWhat the hell.‚Äù She stretched her neck, trying to get a contorted peek at what had collided into her backside. She looked back at me with a questioning look. \n\n‚ÄúIt looked like a moth.‚Äù\n\nShe squirmed a little and reached back into her pants to try and flush it out, but she couldn‚Äôt reach it. She turned her back towards me.\n\n‚ÄúCan you get that out of there?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat, me?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah, can you get Mothra out of my pants?‚Äù\n\nI walked closer to her and looked down. Sure enough, there was some sort of bug tunneling down her pants towards her ass, and not far from her gun. Was I really going to shove my hand down this lady officer‚Äôs pants, with her gun well within my reach. Either this lady had some brass balls, or she was that confident in her abilities to turn me over like a child. \n\n‚ÄúI got to reach down your pants.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOk, can you hurry before it burrows up my ass!‚Äù\n\nI reached down her pants, making slow progress since her utility belt was so damn tight. I thought about asking her to loosen her belt but then thought better of it; a request she may not interpret in my favor. I finally grasped the little turd, pinching its barbed insect leg with my index and middle finger. I pulled my hand up slowly so as not to tear its leg off and lose it for good. I was determined to capture my quarry. In my mind, if I was successful, then surely this cop would let me go home without any trouble. \n\nI pulled the bug from her pants, and it immediately flew out of my hand. It was a bright white moth with a red glowing thorax, and extremely long antennae. It hovered, facing me, as if staring at me in anger for pulling it from its warm comforting shelter, blocking its access to safety. Its wings made a high-pitched hissing sound, growing louder and increasing in pitch. I felt nauseated. The officer had turned, and she was looking up at it when I finally noticed how nice she looked. I was thinking to myself. ‚ÄúMan, I had my hands down her pants.‚Äù At that moment, there was a flash of light, and I felt a sharp pain in my right forearm. It felt like I had been shot in my arm, and yes, I know what it feels like to be shot. Let‚Äôs just say my brother is an idiot when it comes to guns. I looked down and the moth was halfway in my forearm, head buried under my skin and its body vigorously shaking from side-to-side, slowly pulling the rest of its body inward. I could see the red glowing head under my skin, and my arm burned with pain. The moth‚Äôs abdomen was swelling. I sensed that it was feasting on my blood, and the more it consumed the more violent it got. It was growing underneath my skin. \n\nThe officer ran over and grabbed me by the wrist. By this time the moth had completely submerged itself under my skin. It looked like a fleshy baseball sized growth, a tumor with a mean disposition. For whatever reason, she just started pounding on the growth, like she was a toddler demanding ice cream at the dinner table. She slammed her fist down several times. The moth struggled to escape the beating, pushing and tearing through muscle and tendons. Finally, I felt a razor-sharp cutting from the inside, blood spraying forth, and then a burst of flesh, the moth flying free. It no longer had any agility, looking like a fat full tick with tiny wings, barely able to keep its fat ass afloat. The officer pulled out her gun and shot it, exploding blood all over our faces. \n\nThe officer radioed in for an ambulance. While we were waiting on the ambulance, another police car pulled up. \n\n‚ÄúBreathalyzer? 10-55‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, did I say that. I‚Äôm sorry. This gentleman was attacked. The assailant ran off into the woods. He has a knife wound.‚Äù\n\nShe looked at me and shrugged her shoulders, as the other officer walked back to his squad car. ‚ÄúWell, it's not a total lie.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not taking me in for a DUI?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, I think you‚Äôve sobered up. Whatever alcohol you had in your system has been properly evacuated,‚Äù saying this as she pointed down at my pants. I had pissed myself. \n\nI couldn‚Äôt have agreed more. I was never more sober than at that very moment. The ambulance finally arrived, and I didn‚Äôt wait on them. I walked directly to the back door, knocking, asking them to hurry up. Back behind me, in the woods, I could hear a cacophony of katydids buzzing, bullfrogs croaking, and a faint high-pitched fluttering of wings.",

        "text": "Rykar Valley gets its share of strange events, though most don't pay her stories any mind. Would you believe your neighbor if they told you they had seen a looming figure outside their apartment complex, beckoning them to come outside from the shadows? Penny didn't believe us when we told her that our caf√© was haunted, the new hires never did. Her first week, however, saw tourists torn to shreds in our parking lot. A giant by the name of Tall Ben gave her [a quick introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/113xpzs/i_work_at_an_overnight_caf%C3%A9_we_are_not_a_tourist/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to the violence that the supernatural could offer.\n\nI've been here a few months and seen about the same on a regular basis. Everyone reacts differently, so I wasn't surprised when Penny began avoiding the drive thru and, when she had to take an order, she stared hard at the drive thru camera to ignore the face that stared at her behind the glass pane. Her only protection was a thin window and her own willpower, which the giant so wanted to break. It was easy at first, for all of us to ignore that stare, the constant waving over, even his voice muffled by the glass snaked into our ears in a whisper. It was a slow breaking that would drive anyone mad, and for Penny it had only just begun.\n\nThat is why we spotted it in the first place, though. The thing in the drive thru, that is. She was staring at the screen. We take signatures through the drive thru on receipts, there is a little spot to leave a tip and you'd be surprised what our more... unnatural customers leave us. It isn't always money, and it isn't always useful, but in order to remain safe I'll say it is always appreciated. Well, twice a day (or night, since we are an overnight caf√©) we have to input the tip amount that is on each receipt into our system. Penny had to do it since she was still training and it was slow. So, desperate to ignore the shadow-lit face that stared at her through the drive thru window, she stared at the camera that would show the cars lined up to order at our menu, were there any.\n\nThe drive thru is weird. It connects to a road that leads to some apartments behind the caf√©, which makes it appear very long. Of course, that road sees little traffic aside from our customers. Again, however, there was no one in line. The only thing on the camera was a figure in casual attire. A dress shirt unbuttoned and untucked from jeans, occasionally caught in the wind to show a white undershirt.\n\nIt (or he, I guess) was turned around so we could only see his back. \"Hey guys?\" Penny called us over and, seeing as we were already dreading to bring out the deep cleaning list, we leapt to action when she called us over. \"Do you see that too?\"\n\n\"Is he just... standing there?\" Em asked. \"I've never seen someone... just stand there. Not next to the woods.\"\n\n\"So he isn't human, then, right?\" He couldn't be. \"Something would have grabbed him if he was.\" I voiced what was obvious; the forest is where most of the worst things slip out of. At night, it was the most dangerous place in all of Rykar Valley. Maybe even the entire state.\n\nBarrow shrugged it off. \"I mean, it isn't really our job to make sure people don't go out there. If it was, we failed miserably.\"\n\nA little over a week ago, two people went outside when they shouldn't have and got themselves killed. Was I going to have to watch that again on our camera?\n\n\"Should we... I don't know, go tell them to come inside?\" Penny saw the person as a human, that was probably a mistake. \"Or holler at them at least?\"\n\n\"Over the speaker?\"\n\nI clicked the button without thinking, channeling my voice to the back of our store. \"Hey, can you hear me?\"\n\nNothing, just silence.\n\nPixels adjusted slightly, but I couldn't tell if that was just the wind catching his shirt again. Had he... moved? Swayed? It was impossible to see.\n\n\"Can you hear me?\"\n\nEm slapped my hand away from the speaker. \"Don't do that!\"\n\n\"Why?\" I asked.\n\n\"Is he moving?\" Penny still had her eyes on the screen and it was then that I also noted Tall Ben was gone, his visage not even visible in the distant shadow. \"I think he moved.\"\n\nNo, he was standing still. The wind was picking up, little bits of rain starting hitting the window outside. It often sprinkled here in Rykar Valley, the weather was ever overcast. Thankfully, our camera still had a high visibility in the dark. We all stared so hard at the screen that we were blinded when a car came around the corner to stop at our menu with brights in full exposure.\n\nIt had blocked our view of the person down the road for only a moment and I was certain he would be gone when the car finally pulled around. But, when the vehicle stopped at the menu they turned off their high beams and I could see past it, the man stood there just as he had before. Unmoving.\n\nThen, for whatever reason, the truck turned back on their brights. I couldn't see the guy anymore.\n\n\"Thanks for choosing The Drowsy Spectre, take a look at the menu and order when you're ready.\" Penny recited.\n\n\"I'm ready.\" The customer replied over the speaker, then silence.\n\nPenny hesitated, then clicked the button to speak again. \"Okay, order whenever you're ready.\" She repeated.\n\n\"Do y'all have cappuccinos?\"\n\nThat was, depending on the size, two shots of espresso and steamed milk made mostly of foam. No sweetener, no flavors. Just foamy espresso. A caf√© staple. \"Yes, we do.\"\n\n\"Oh good because that is what I usually get from Tom Thumb.\" The customer replied. I sighed loudly. Tom Thumb (well, I guess it is Cumberland Farms now, but I am going to resist that change like the stubborn i is a gas station, for those of you that don't know, and most gas station coffee titles their sweet coffee flavor as \"cappuccino.\" It isn't a cappuccino though, not even close.\n\nSo the customer did *not* expect a foamy espresso, but a sweet drip coffee of some kind. Penny didn't know that. \"Awesome! What size?\"\n\nDamn. Too late. I would have to explain things at the window. \"Regular.\"\n\n\"Like a medium?\"\n\n\"Yeah, a regular.\"\n\nGod dammit, I felt Penny's pain. \"Okay, so a medium cappuccino.\"\n\n\"Yeah with some creamer if y'all have it.\"\n\n\"$4.36 at the window.\" She watched the car pull around to the building's north side, we all did. When the lights were away from the camera, we all saw the man on the road.\n\nHe was a lot closer. Not quite at the store, but... closer. It was definitely a dress shirt that was blowing in the wind, just like I thought. Untorn jeans, dark hair. I couldn't be sure about much detail because the night contrast on the camera drowns out colors pretty heavily. He just sort of stood there, not even swaying in the wind. Completely still.\n\nI explained to the customer at the window that he would likely *not* enjoy a cappuccino and rectified his order. He was happy anyway, it was a whole dollar cheaper. With him on his way, we returned to watching the man on the road.\n\nOriginally I assumed Tall Ben left because of the customer in the drive thru, but he did not return when the car left. Then we all saw where he went. From the shadows around the man in the woods, a figure loomed in the trees. I would have thought it a tree in the wind if it weren't for a large hand that crept from the forest's edge, over the road.\n\nIf that was a person, they would be meat for his next \"[product](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/znz6xr/im_a_barista_at_a_caf%C3%A9_that_serves_the_odd_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).\" If it wasn't, Tall Ben was about to find out for them.\n\nI clicked the drive thru speaker to life, earning a confused glance from the others.\n\nBut now we could hear. It was quiet and distant, but we could hear.\n\n\"Hey... do you...\" Tall Ben was trying to talk to him. \"Come... if you...\"\n\nThe rain was falling too hard and the speaker was overwhelmed with static. We all leaned in close, trying to catch anything over the storm. All of us had our eyes away from the screen and I regret that. I want to know what happened.\n\nA boom shook the store, knocking us all away from the speaker. It wasn't thunder, no. It was a roar of anger, or pain, or perhaps even fear. When I finally got my head up to look at the screen, the man still stood where he had.\n\nThere was no Tall Ben.\n\nAnother car pulled around, but they didn't have their bright lights on. We could still see the strange man. \"Thank you for choosing The Drowsy Spectre. Take a look at the menu and order whenever you're ready.\"\n\n\"Yeah, thanks.\" Silence. They would need a moment.\n\nI saw it, though. I don't know if the others did because no one said anything, but I swore I saw the guy take a step. Not a lunge, or a run, just a single backwards step. Now, if a customer is taking too long looking at the menu, we might assume they need help.\n\nIn that case, we say \"if you have any questions, just let me know.\" Penny then waited for a reply.\n\nThe guy, he took another step. Maybe two, I couldn't tell. I know Barrow saw it because he gave me a look. One that said we had an issue, but none of us knew what it was.\n\n\"Can I just get a caramel latte but can I get that iced? A small?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. Anything else for you?\" Two more gentle steps.\n\nAfter a long moment of silence, the customer replied. \"Nope, that'll be it.\"\n\n\"$5.06 at the window.\"\n\nI knew he was moving. A puddle rippled as his foot struck it so carefully. Nothing happened, however, then Penny spoke to the lady at the window. Maybe he couldn't hear them? He was still a bit far away from the shop.\n\nBarrow leaned forward and pressed 'speak.' \"Are you a customer? Do you want something?\"\n\nThree more steps. He was close enough to enter the light out back. \"I could peek out and see if I can see him off-camera.\" Em offered. \"I don't have the same effect on these things.\"\n\nUsually only humans did. \"Alright, just don't go outside.\" Barrow watched the camera as Em went to the back door. The way the camera is angled, we can see the door as it is perpendicular to the drive thru road. It opens so that she could see out without having to leave. We couldn't see *her* though, the door blocked Em.\n\nWe watched it open, but the door was sort of reflective so it shined on our store's light out back and the camera caught that. The contrast was way too high suddenly.\n\nBarrow clicked the speaker on again so we could hear, but the rain was coming down pretty hard. I think I heard Em talking, but we really couldn't make anything out. Because of this, I was going to go back and see what she was up to, but right before I did the door slammed shut. Em came running up as if something was fixing to bite her butt.\n\n\"Okay it doesn't care that I am a pixie it doesn't care about that at all! Absolutely not!\"\n\n\"What did you do?\" I asked.\n\nShe looked towards the back door.\n\nBut Barrow gestured at the camera. \"Look.\"\n\nThe guy was a lot closer, actually in the drive thru itself. At the very end of the drive thru, seen even through the rain, was a figure that was getting soaked by the downpour. He didn't care, didn't even move, didn't flinch as a bolt of lightning brightened the forest up.\n\nAnother customer, more steps. Penny noticed and started to keep her word count low, but the guy was still making a steady approach. He was a lot closer now, which was concerning as when Penny opened the window and cashed out the customer we saw the guy outside take a few steps. Not quite as many as when we were talking directly to him, but a few; it was as if he heard bits and pieces of something and that was enough to follow whatever rules he was bound to.\n\nCrap. Usually Heartmin comes inside, but she doesn't have to. Even the supernatural doesn't always like the cold rain. There was a rule about her, one that required us to make her order in two minutes once it was placed. That seems like a lot of time, but for her order it really isn't.\n\nHeartmin also asked the *same* questions every time.\n\n\"Do you have heavy cream?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do you have a panini press?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nYou get the picture. Each answer came with a step from our new friend, though he didn't respond to our customers at all. Not at first, anyway.\n\n\"I don't like this guy out here.\" Heartmin complained, not having finished her order. \"Who is he? Why is he here?\"\n\nThe moment she acknowledged his presence, he turned slightly to put his back to her. Then, he took a step.\n\n\"Seriously. Tell him to leave or something.\" He got closer. \"Get out of here, you bum!\" Two more steps. \"If you don't get him away from me, I will leave right now! I'll-\" She put her car into gear and started to leave.\n\nThe guy was already at her window though. She had spoken too much.\n\nWhen Heartmin doesn't get her drink in two minutes, or it is made wrong, or she *really* doesn't like something, she screams. Like, really screams. I had to go to get my hearing checked out last time that happened.\n\nEven the walls of the store weren't enough to mute her banshee cry.\n\nI had to get on the ground, to cover my ears, to *protect* myself. I think one of our thin glasses broke, I heard something shatter. A lightbulb blew up. The lights flickered too.\n\nThen it went quiet. We looked back up at the camera, but her car was gone. In its place? The man, with his back to the camera, soaked from head to toe. Our store was still open, however, and a customer came in.\n\nWe turned from the drive thru to see a familiar, yet confusing face. Well, confusing and *confused.*\n\n\"Dr. Fields?\" Some of you long time readers might recognize that name. He's the one that was hunting that pest Bilgoth. Then I saw him at the Headsman's, but he wasn't right.\n\nThen he was there, in our lobby, raggedy and skinny. Completely unlike the man I had seen months ago, but I knew that face shape. I knew those weighing eyes.\n\n\"Me?\" He asked. \"You *do* know me?\"\n\n\"Don't I?\"\n\n\"Where did I go?\" What sort of question was that? \"How did I get to Texas?‚Äù We aren‚Äôt in Texas, but I guess he had been. ‚ÄúAll of you vanished! I was here, but then I was there!\"\n\nLike I always say, it is a [long story](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zu5pm6/im_a_barista_at_a_caf%C3%A9_that_serves_the_odd_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). \"You mean at the Headsman's?\"\n\n\"How did I get there?!\" He shouted.\n\nThe guy at the camera was at the wall. He could hear Dr. Fields, but could he get in? \"What do you remember?\" Barrow asked Fields.\n\n\"Nothing!\" The shouting, it was too loud.\n\nI approached Dr. Fields. \"Hey, we don't know much about you either. You came in looking for something, then left. Next time we saw you, you had no idea who you were.\"\n\n\"Why are we whispering?\"\n\nHe was cautious. \"Because there is something that might kill us if it hears.\"\n\nFields swallowed, but understood. That he had no questions for, the supernatural was still ingrained in his mind. \"But what happened to me? What is this place?\"\n\n\"This is just a caf√© that gets some weird customers.\" Well, they were a lot more than weird. \"Whatever happened to you, it didn't happen here.\"\n\n\"Guys?\" Penny pulled our attention back to the camera. \"Its gone.\"\n\nI went back around the counter and, sure enough, the guy wasn't there anymore.\n\n\"Did he go back in the woods?\" Em asked. \"Did you see him move?\"\n\nPenny shook her head. \"No, I was listening to you guys.\"\n\n\"You weren't the only one.\" Barrow muttered, then he nodded towards the kitchen. He shushed everyone just as we turned to see the backwards guy standing in the back of the lobby, by the bathrooms and towards the back door. How had he gotten inside?\n\nWater dripped all over the floor. He was, as expected, soaked.\n\n\"Selene!\" Barrow shouted, causing the guy to rotate away from him and take a backwards step.\n\nOur manager opened her office door. \"Yeah?\"\n\nThe thing then turned towards her, facing us.\n\nMy own teeth hurt when my eyes fell on it. It was... teeth. Wiggling, like maggots in a skin suit. Little ones, as if from rodents, humans too, and sharper from predators. All teeth, clicking and chittering ever so silently. Still, the thing didn't move as everyone stayed quiet.\n\nSelene caught on fast.\n\n\"H-help.\" A voice came from the teeth. No, from inside the teeth. They scattered like bugs to reveal an all-too-human face underneath. \"P-please...\"\n\nIt wasn't just water on the floor. The thing was dripping blood.\n\nBut there was another one, in the shadows behind the first creature. Another figure covered in teeth. If each of them had someone inside, that meant that the second one could only be one ‚Äúperson.‚Äù Heartmin.\n\nIt was... eating them. Teeth were eating them, munching away of their own accord. Crunching, clicking, clinking away as they slithered about by some unholy magic. Heartmin was sobbing, but she did not dare scream again. The teeth moved with each breath, with each soft cry, as if it were their heartbeat. Even their victim's *heart* seemed to make them ripple ever so slightly, taking just a little bit more flesh.\n\n\"P... p.... please...\" The guy begged again. Each sound, each letter, brought with it a squishing sound until blood burst from where his eye should have been. He screamed, the teeth moved faster. He screamed so much.\n\nThe blood that poured from between the teeth would be enough to kill anyone, but the teeth still stood. Their victim was silent.\n\nWe were all silent.\n\nOne by one, the teeth fell from the corpse onto the ground. They scattered across the floor in all directions, not by magic but just gravity. Where they landed, they stayed.\n\n\"N... n... no...\" Heartmin whispered. Then she grunted, then she gurgled. Her death, for all her power, was ever so silent.\n\nHer killers also toppled to the floor to reveal a mooshy corpse, organs half chewed and bones exposed. Her skull was on full display, but not her teeth. No, those belonged to something else now. Those were on the floor, and they would be hungry.\n\nAt least, I thought they would be. But we stood there, in silence, until a customer walked in.\n\n\"Uh...\" The lady seemed normal. Looked human, I mean. \"Teeth?\"\n\nThey didn't respond to her voice.\n\nAnd we learned nothing else of it. Heartmin is dead, we know that. She hasn't been seen since that night. The other guy? We don't know either. Tall Ben has been absent as well, but I doubt some teeth could kill that giant. Oh, and I am talking to Richard about hiring Fields for the kitchen. Some of us would like a day off sometimes. Since that night, however, we have not had a similar issue.\n\nRegardless, I left a new rule on the list and crossed out an old one.\n\n\\- Rule 11. If you see someone standing in the drive thru, don't make a sound. The store is closed.\n\nAnd go [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/AHauntedBarista/comments/11dsc3v/the_drowsy_spectre/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

        "text": "I keep having recurring dreams, and I am glad about it\n\nThe snow surprised us all today; just two days ago we kept our windows opened and were glad about having a nice, sunny day after months of vitamin D deficiency. However, the temperature suddenly dropped, and now I cursed myself for having to go grocery shopping while wind hurt my face. \n\n\nFinally, I entered my building and turned left towards stairs. Living on fourth floor is something I got used to, but today I decided to take an elevator, even though I hate the stomach drop feeling when stepping into one. My building is relatively small and so is the elevator - maximum four people are allowed in it, and luckily I was alone.  For some unknown reason, I pressed the button leading to 13th floor instead of 4th.\n\n\nOh, you dumb fuck, I thought to myself, now you will have to wait and go on 13th and come back in this stupid, old, tiny death trap. I felt the usual stomach drop as the elevator started going up surprisingly fast. Too fast maybe. I put my bags on the floor and leaned for a quick rest. While trying to catch my breath, I got this nagging feeling, similar to one when you are trying to recall the thought you had just seconds ago. What was it, what did I forget? I started using the old reliable technique of tracking back the steps that lead me to my current thoughts, re-calculating how I got here and what I needed to do next. \n\n\nWait, how can I go on 13th floor when this building only has four floors?  Suddenly I realized something is not right. Why were there so many buttons for just four floors? How is it possible the elevator is even going up now? Where the fuck is it going? Panic started to rise, and I found myself out of breath. I looked at the board and saw the lights blinking: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13; 12, 11, 10, 9 and so on. The elevator kept going from first floor to the last one without stopping. Lights kept blinking frenetically while I pushed and pushed the stop button, but nothing happened. The air felt thinner and thinner by every second, and I could feel sweat dripping from my armpits to my waist. I started to feel dizzy as the motion of going up and down in a matter of seconds did not stop. \n\n\nFinally, the elevator stopped. To my dismay, one of my worst fears came to life- I was stuck mid-floors. There was a small opening between floors and I started to scream for help. After a few moments I saw a man wearing suit and tie as he crouched and looked at me through the opening. \n\n\n- Quick, give me your hand, he said weirdly calmly.\n\n- I can‚Äôt fit through that, I replied desperately and angry at myself for eating too much during holidays.\n\n-Wait here, I‚Äôm going to get some help, he said and disappeared, quickly as he appeared.\n\n\n\nGreat, now I have to wait here for God knows how long. In the elevator. Which is open. Between floors. The air felt damp and musty. It reminded me of exciting days when I was younger and enjoyed urban exploring. Except there was nothing exciting about this situation, and my claustrophobia was getting more severe with every second.\n\n\nHowever, after no longer than a minute, the suit guy returned with a man who looked like your stereotypical handy man: stained uniform, gray hair, mustache, belt with tools and a red toolbox. Without any words, he pulled out some tools I have never seen in my life and started trying to completely open the elevator doors. I stood there quiet, nails clawing into my palms, and waited. You are fine, everything will be okay. He will open the doors, they will somehow pull you through the tiny opening, and you will continue to take stairs as always. Of course this is happening to me with my shitty luck, the first time in a year of living here you took the elevator and it broke. Huh, Alanis Morissette song at best. \n\n\nThen there was a sound you never want to hear in this situation: the wires. I could feel the elevator is slowly starting to move and go down again. Eerily slowly, clunking and screeching of wires. \n\n\n-Hurry up, I exclaimed in sheer panic that I never felt until this moment.\n\n- Sorry kid, you will have to lay down and wait for it to drop on the first floor, said the handy man, taking his tools back and putting them into the red box.\n\n\nBefore I managed to tell them to wait, the elevator suddenly dropped. I laid on the dirty floor in fetal position and just waited for what felt like forever. Well, this is how I die, I guess, was my last thought when I jerked and woke up in my bed.\n\n\nFucking hell. I was drenched in sweat as my cat was suffocating my with its fur furnace. I was in my room, in the dark, safe and sound and most importantly- away from the elevator and non-existing heights. How many times will I have this dream, I was wondering. With small variations, I could recall at least four times of having this particular dream, and it was always the same: same building, same elevator and floor plan. This time the handy man was a different one, but still the dream was more or less the same. \n\n\nI was still in a half sitting position, I noticed something weird. At the end of my bed, where I usually put my bags and purse on the floor, something moved. My eyes were still adjusting to the dark, but I started to see shapes. There was something there: something squatting and looking at me. Its hands were very lanky and long, skinny as the rest of its body. They were just resting and hanging from its body, right \nnext to its scrawny knees. Never in my entire life I felt so frightened, and yet I could not take my look away. I was not sleeping; I was not having sleep paralysis. I was completely and painfully awake. \n\n\nThe thing kept looking at me with its red dot of eyes, still in squatting position, still only inches from the tip of my toes. And just as I prepared to let out the loudest scream of my life, it said:\n\n\n- Be happy you are still having them.",

I join the line of caffeine addicts and quickly spot the woman I‚Äôm hoping to find ‚Äì Akasha‚Äôs friend Liza, whose picture I saw in the journal. \n\nPierced, with a streak of red dyed in her hair, she strikes me as the type of girl to attain besties status with Akasha. Liza hands a middle-aged man his change, and then her eyes find me. \n\n‚ÄúHow can I help you?‚Äù she asks.\n\nI tell her. \n\nFortunately she is open, maybe even eager, to talk about her friend. I use the same story I did with Mrs. Samona ‚Äì I‚Äôm doing a piece about missing teens. It makes my purpose for being here seem more noble and selfless, like I‚Äôm trying to make a difference in the world. I hate to lie to people, but I need answers. \n\nLiza informs me that she‚Äôll be off work in fifteen minutes. I order a coffee and find a table. I take a deep swig of my scorching hot brew and burn my tongue. I welcome the pain. It reminds me that I‚Äôm alive. \n\nFifteen minutes turn into half an hour, and time slows. My eagerness to pick Liza‚Äôs brain grows with each passing second. I try to distract myself by checking my email but fastidiously avoid Facebook. As I scan my favorite news apps, the irony is not lost on me that all this started with an app. Tinder. Shit, Josh, why couldn‚Äôt you stick to the good old-fashioned bar scene?\n\nThinking about my brother drives the loss home. I‚Äôve pushed a lot of my emotions aside but as I wait here for Liza to join me, they sneak up on me full-force. Finally Liza arrives, iced tea in hand. She is still wearing her work uniform as she sits down in front of me.\n\n‚ÄúSo you're writing a story about Akasha?‚Äù\n\nThe lies continue. \n\n‚ÄúYes, I was hoping you could give me a sense of what she was like. I understand you and Akasha were pretty close.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe were best friends,‚Äù she confirms. ‚ÄúWe had something in common ‚Äî crazy parents. Only difference is, her folks are loaded and I'm supporting mine.‚Äù\n\nThis revelation is communicated in such a casual, offhand manner that it‚Äôs easy to ignore the weight behind the words. We‚Äôve barely started this conversation, and I already feel sorry for her.\n\nLiza wipes a few tears and continues to tell me about her missing friend. Akasha may be destroying my life, but this girl still cares for her.     \n\n‚ÄúAkasha had a tendency to date guys who weren't available,‚Äù Liza explains. ‚ÄúBad boys, dudes with girlfriends, married men. She‚Äôd obsess over people who could never love her back. She‚Äôd always get her heart broken.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWould she meet some of these dates on Tinder?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAkasha loved that stupid app. She was addicted to the attention. She‚Äôd hook up with guys and then wonder why none of them called her back after getting what they wanted.‚Äù\n\nI consider this. It certainly explains Akasha‚Äôs rage.\n\n‚ÄúTheir first date would always be at this Starbucks. I was her lookout. My job was to swoop in and save her if the dude turned out to be a weirdo or some loser who had posted a fake pic.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhere do you think she is now?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHer mom believes she ran away. That she‚Äôs living some crazy party life in Miami or stripping her way across the country.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou don't believe that?‚Äù\n\nLiza takes a deep gulp from her drink.\n\n‚ÄúI was Akasha's best friend. If she was still around, she‚Äôd be in touch.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSo what do you think happened?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI think she met the wrong guy.‚Äù\n\nLiza doesn‚Äôt come right out and say it, but the message is clear. She thinks Akasha is dead. \n\nI immediately dismiss the idea. I‚Äôm a physical therapist student. I believe in science. Ghosts don‚Äôt have a place in my perception of the world.\n\n‚ÄúWho was the last person Akasha met on Tinder before she vanished?‚Äù  \n\n‚ÄúHe was some Manhattan lawyer. He picked her up in his BMW. Pretty hot in a late-thirties, GQ kind of way.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúCould he be‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen Akasha first went missing, cops came to talk to me. I told them about the lawyer. Guess what they said?  They already checked out that lead and the attorney, I think his name is Darryl or Derek, turned out to be a dead end. Know why?‚Äù\n\nThe question hangs there for a moment, but I can guess the answer. \n\nLiza leans closer, her face masklike as she speaks. ‚ÄúDarryl died in a freak car accident. Lost control of his Porsche, hit a median and the gas tank blew. He was burned to a crisp. They had to identify him with dental records.‚Äù\n\nA chill travels up my spine. Followed by a question. *Was Darryl/Derek Akasha‚Äôs first victim?*\n\n‚ÄúWant to hear the best part? The creep had a wife and kid. Akasha sure knew how to pick them.‚Äù\n\nI spin these new facts around in my head, hoping to make sense of the senseless.      \n\nLiza takes a final swig of her drink and rises. ‚ÄúSorry, but I need to get back to work. It was good chatting with you. Email me when the article hits the Web.‚Äù\n\nLiza turns away. I stare after her, pensive.\n\nIf Darryl had something to do with Akasha‚Äôs disappearance, the knowledge of her fate died with him. I‚Äôve reached an impasse and have no idea what my next move is.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe icy road unfurls before me, as perilous as my own future. I view a news report of Darryl Kelly‚Äôs accident and recognize the man. Was he her first victim?\n\nAt this point I only have one lead, and it‚Äôs a longshot. Darryl‚Äôs younger brother Adam works as a freelance editor in Manhattan. I already made up my mind not to approach Darryl‚Äôs wife. She‚Äôs been through enough already without me digging up a possible infidelity in her late husband‚Äôs past. My plan is to pay the brother a visit and see if he can be any more helpful than the other people I‚Äôve interviewed. \n\nMy chirping cellphone derails this train of thought. I scan the caller ID. It‚Äôs Lynn. My heart misses a beat. I‚Äôm both relieved and anxious as I press the answer button and Lynn‚Äôs voice fills my car.\n\n‚ÄúMark, I need to see you. We have to talk.‚Äù\n\nThe voice is businesslike, determined. She must‚Äôve rehearsed this call numerous times. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs meet at the diner across from your place in an hour?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I say robotically. Her mission accomplished, Lynn ends the call without further comment.\n\nMy mind is churning. I was hoping Lynn would break the silence and reach out to me, but this chilly communication has unnerved me further. Has Lynn made up her mind about me? Is she about to officially dump me? I take the fact that she is coming to my neighborhood as an ominous sign. Sounds like she‚Äôs making sure I don‚Äôt get any funny ideas about spending the night at her place. She finds my man cave endearing in an anthropological way ‚Äî she prefers to experience it from a distance. Sleepovers tend to happen at her place, where we don‚Äôt have to worry about Cyrus disturbing our privacy. \n\nAnxiety spreads from deep inside the pit of my stomach. \n\nI can‚Äôt let Akasha tear us apart. \n\nI can‚Äôt lose Lynn.\n\nDoing my best to manage my growing unease, I turn the wheel and head to Briarwood.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAs I pull into the diner‚Äôs parking lot I know I‚Äôm running about five minutes late, but Lynn isn‚Äôt there yet. This seems out of character for her ‚Äì not only is she incredibly organized (to an almost scary degree), she‚Äôs rarely late for appointments. \n\nI seat myself at a comfy booth in the ‚Äò50s style diner and inhale the scent of sizzling comfort food that wafts through the air. The corned beef and hash is amazing here, but my frayed nerves have robbed me of my appetite. This isn‚Äôt a date, and I prefer to receive bad news on an empty stomach. I order a Diet Coke but after two sips of my artificial treat, I switch to beer. I don‚Äôt want to be drunk when Lynn shows up, but I need something to take the edge off while I wait. \n\nThirty minutes and two beers later, I conclude that Lynn has had a change of heart. I pay my check and walk across the street. The cold air diminishes the alcohol‚Äôs effects but I still have a buzz going when I step into my apartment. I have the place to myself and the loneliness immediately makes me melancholy. Lynn has been such a big part of my reality for so long that I feel lost without her.\n\n*Goddammit, I want my old life back.*\n\nWho knows what made Lynn blow me off, but I don‚Äôt take it as a good sign. I slip off my jacket and decide to take a shower. Moments later, a stream of hot water is warming my frozen limbs. I‚Äôm been out and about all day and this winter weather is getting old. I close my eyes and bask in the soothing sensation. That‚Äôs when I hear a familiar voice.\n\n‚ÄúMark‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nStartled, I open my eyes and find Lynn standing behind the shower curtain. The plastic distorts her form. I pull the curtain back a few inches and realize she‚Äôs naked. My body immediately responds to the sight of her lithe, shapely figure. *God, she‚Äôs beautiful!* I‚Äôm flooded with relief. Lynn is back and that‚Äôs all that matters. \n\nWordlessly she steps into the shower and joins me under the hot stream. Steam wafts around us. We hug and I don‚Äôt want the moment to end. What does it mean? Is all forgiven? Has Lynn figured out that Akasha was lying? \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you, Lynn, this girl set me up.‚Äù The words sound lame the moment they leave my lips, but I have to explain my actions. \n\nI can‚Äôt allow Akasha to tear us apart.\n\nI have to fight for the woman I love.\n\nSuddenly, I realize that the shower is becoming hotter...unpleasantly so...\n\nI run my hands down my girlfriend‚Äôs bare back, bury my face in her smooth shoulder. Lynn leans forward to kiss me and I gladly accept. Our lips find each other and lock with hunger. \n\nMy passon cools in a hurry. \n\nSomething is wrong. \n\nThe woman I‚Äôm making out with doesn‚Äôt taste like Lynn. I once kissed a girl in high school who was a chain smoker, and this is about ten times worse. It feels like someone emptied out an ashtray in my mouth. As I pull back, my gut clenches with terror and a knot forms in my throat. \n\n*It can‚Äôt be...* \n\nThe woman staring back at me isn‚Äôt Lynn, it‚Äôs Akasha. Empty eyes fixed on mine.\n\nI slip in the wet tub and fall backwards. Pain flares up my shoulder as my 180-pound frame hits the fiberglass edge. Hard. \n\nDazed, I squint through the steam and water and realize that I‚Äôm alone in the shower. \n\n*Was it all in my mind?*\n\nI dismiss the thought. I know what I saw. And touched.\n\nSuddenly the shower-head turns toward me and the hot-water knob turns by itself. Instincts take over and I react without thought. I snatch the shower curtain and pull it off its hooks to shield me. It‚Äôs not a moment too soon as a jet of boiling water blasts down on me. The heat singes my fingers and the super-heated tangle of plastic is painful to the touch, but at least it‚Äôs deflecting most of the suddenly scalding water. \n\nAnd then the sizzling spray dies down, becoming a mere trickle. \n\nI gasp for air and scramble out of the tub. My naked flesh smacks against the cold floor tiles. My body has turned crab-red, skin inflamed from the hot water‚Äôs assault. I leave a wet trail on the hardwood floor as I stumble into the kitchen. My gaze locks on the gallon of mineral water sitting on the kitchen table. Without hesitation I pour the bottle‚Äôs soothing contents over my body. I remember my first aid training. *Cooling the burn reduces swelling by conducting heat away from the skin.* \n\nDread bubbles up and I let the truth reach the surface of my mind. \n\nI‚Äôm being stalked by a dead woman.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI do my best to contain my increasing anxiety. Akasha‚Äôs advances are growing more insistent, and I sense that time is running out. As I get dressed, I receive a call from Lynn. \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry I stood you up,‚Äù she says, and I know she‚Äôs fighting back tears. ‚ÄúI got off the train and was all ready to head to the diner‚Äî‚Äù She breaks off. ‚ÄúI was scared of what I would do if I saw you.‚Äù \n\nI read between the lines. \n\nLynn‚Äôs plan was to end our relationship. But she couldn‚Äôt go through with it. This gives me hope. Hopefully we can fix this and put it all behind us. But first I must resolve the Akasha problem.\n\nI know I‚Äôm grasping for straws here, but I decide to reach out to Darryl‚Äôs brother Adam. Adam works as a freelance editor at Visual Aid, a post-production house that cuts commercials and movie trailers. I look up his work number and make the call. The receptionist picks up after a couple of rings and with some prodding, she tells me that Adam quit several weeks ago. I look up his home address online.\n\nAdam lives in Greenwich Village ‚Äì editing must pay well. I arrive around five o‚Äôclock just as a cold, gray day becomes an even colder night. As I walk up to the majestic brownstone, I feel like a peasant visiting royalty. A week ago I was thinking I‚Äôd have my own sweet pad somewhere in Manhattan, down the road a bit. Now I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll see tomorrow.\n\nI‚Äôm reaching out to ring the buzzer when an elderly lady emerges from the front lobby, about to take her Cocker Spaniel for a walk around the neighborhood. She‚Äôs in her own little world and before the door can close, I slip into the hallway. \n\nA few minutes later I‚Äôve located Adam‚Äôs apartment. I press my ear against the heavy oak door. Based on the muted shuffling of feet and the low drone of the TV, I can conclude that someone‚Äôs home.\n\nI knock on the door.  \n\nThe television turns off and someone approaches. I go over my pre-rehearsed spiel in my head. Adam and I share something important in common ‚Äì we‚Äôve both lost our brothers to Akasha. I‚Äôm banking on this connection to make Adam talk, assuming he knows anything. The lock snaps back and the door swings opens, revealing Adam.\n\nHe wears ragged sweats and heavy bags ring his hollow eyes. It looks like he hasn‚Äôt shaved, or even bathed, in days. I catch a glimpse of his apartment behind him and it mirrors his sorry state. Empty boxes of takeout and crushed beer cans litter the dwelling. I‚Äôm still debating my next move when I notice the burn marks on his hands. They‚Äôre identical to the ones Akasha left on my neck a couple days ago. \n\n*I‚Äôve come to the right place.*\n\nMy presence unnerves Adam and he shoots me a suspicious look. ‚ÄúWho the hell are you?‚Äù\n\nI avoid the question and cut to the chase. ‚ÄúWe need to talk.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúTalk about what?‚Äù\n\nI had planned to be subtle about this, but instead I just come out and say it. ‚ÄúAkasha.‚Äù\n\nHis expression goes from annoyed to outright hostile. But I press on. ‚ÄúAkasha Samona vanished six months ago. I know she was dating your brother Darryl...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNews flash, pal ‚Äî Darryl was married, and he‚Äôs dead now. You don‚Äôt look like a cop. So why bug me with this shit?‚Äù\n\nHe leans closer. ‚ÄúI told the cops everything I know, which isn‚Äôt much. Now get the fuck out of my face.‚Äù\n\nI remain frozen in place. \n\n‚ÄúWhat are you waiting for?! Get the hell out of here before I kick your ass!‚Äù \n\nI‚Äôm about to comment on the burn marks but decide against it. Instead I grab his arm and push him into the apartment. He‚Äôs a big man but too drunk and surprised to put up much of a fight. I‚Äôm not sure what has gotten into me. The pressure, anger and loss of the last few days must have made me snap.  \n\nI‚Äôve lost my brother.\n\nI might be losing my sanity.\n\nBut I‚Äôm not going to lose Lynn.\n\nI can‚Äôt allow Akasha to go after my girl. Adam is hiding something and I will make him talk. One way or another. \n\nI slam Adam against the wall. He catches his bearings, pissed now. He takes a swing at me but his punch is alcohol-sloppy and misses. I fire back, landing two quick punches that topple him onto the couch. My eyes land on a small fire extinguisher resting on the couch. Looks like someone is taking his safety seriously. \n\nA moan escapes Adam‚Äôs mouth and he rubs his jaw, spits blood on the floor. After two punches, my hands feel like they‚Äôve been pounding a brick wall. It‚Äôs been quite a while since I‚Äôve been in a fight.\n\n‚ÄúWhat the fuck do you want, man?‚Äù Adam asks, half confrontational and half afraid.\n\n‚ÄúAkasha was seeing Darryl when she disappeared. Tell me what happened.‚Äù\n\nAdam only glares at me. \n\nMy rage detonates and I pull the collar of my jacket back, exposing burn marks identical to his. \n\n‚ÄúShe's been coming after you too, hasn't she? That‚Äôs why you quit your job. Why you‚Äôre trying to hide in a bottle. What did you and Darryl fucking do to her?‚Äù\n\nStill no response. \n\nMy anger drains and turns into desperation and fear. \n\n‚ÄúTalk to me, goddammit.‚Äù \n\nAdam lets out a deep sob. ‚ÄúShe can't hurt you! She can't hurt anyone anymore.‚Äù \n\nMy eyes bore into him and I say, ‚ÄúTell me everything.‚Äù \n\nAdam does.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe words come haltingly as Adam dredges up a past he prayed would remain forgotten. \n\n‚ÄúDarryl was getting antsy during Megan‚Äôs pregnancy. Their sex life was suffering, and he started looking at other women.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHe started hooking up with women on Tinder,‚Äù I say.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my fault. He saw me using the app, meeting new girls all the time. I guess one day he downloaded Tinder and met up with someone.‚Äù\n\nI process this. Darryl had money, a cool career, a beautiful wife. But it wasn‚Äôt enough.\n\n‚ÄúHow often?‚Äù\n\nAdam shakes his head. \n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. It happened a lot. Darryl was out of control. It became an addiction, I think. Don‚Äôt need to be a shrink to know he was trying to destroy his marriage. I told him he was playing with fire.‚Äù\n\n*And he finally cam too close to the flame.* I keep this though to myself.\n\nAdma pauses and downs a shot of Jack Daniels before continuing. ‚ÄúHe would take his dates to our parents‚Äô cabin in Long Island. Mom passed away a little over a year ago and the place has been empty ever since. We were thinking of putting it on the market, but it needs a lot of work...‚Äù\n\nAdam‚Äôs voice trails off for a second before he says, ‚ÄúDarryl‚Äôs wife was eight months pregnant and he was meeting women online and taking them back to the lakeside cabin we spent our summers at.‚Äù \n\nAdam‚Äôs voice trembles with anger. ‚ÄúI knew it wouldn‚Äôt end well. One night I got a call. Darryl was freaking out on the other end, begging me to come to the house. He refused to go into detail on the phone, but I knew something terrible had happened. The panic in his voice...it wasn‚Äôt like anything I‚Äôd ever heard before. God, how I wish I‚Äôd never answered the phone that night.‚Äù\n\nAnger is making way for another emotion: deep remorse. Tears well up in Adam‚Äôs eyes. Suddenly I‚Äôm not so sure I want to hear the rest of the story. But no turning back now.\n\n‚ÄúYour brother had murdered Akasha.‚Äù\n\nThe words slip out because by now I know Akasha must be dead, and I‚Äôm tired of Adam dwelling on the details. I want...no, *I need* to know what happened to the woman who has turned my life into a waking nightmare. \n\n‚ÄúDarryl didn‚Äôt say a word when I pulled up. He just walked into the house. I followed him into the living room and that‚Äôs where she was. Sprawled out on the floor, her neck twisted... I just knew she was dead.‚Äù\n\nI can vividly picture the scene in my mind. I can almost see Darryl‚Äôs panicked, ashen features and the numb shock Adam must‚Äôve experienced when he first laid eyes on the woman on the floor. \n\n‚ÄúWhy did he kill her?‚Äù I ask.\n\n‚ÄúHe said it was an accident. He was trying to break it off with Akasha. He told her he had a wife and kid.‚Äù\n\n*Maybe he should‚Äôve mentioned that before he contacted her online*, I think, but keep my mouth shut.\n\n‚ÄúAkasha threatened to tell his wife everything. That‚Äôs when he snapped. He gave her a shove, she lost her balance... Hit her head on the chimney.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you call the cops, if it was an accident?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI told him he should. Darryl said nobody would believe him. He figured they‚Äôd take one look at a high-paid lawyer with a baby on the way and a dead nineteen‚Äìyear-old in a remote cabin turned fuckpad... A jury would send him away for good.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúWhat then?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGod forgive me... I decided to help him destroy the evidence.‚Äù \n\nAdam wipes away the tears that keep welling up. I know he wants to stop talking about this ‚Äì reliving that night must be torturous ‚Äì but I need him to finish his story.\n\n‚ÄúYou became an accomplice to murder.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI figured she was dead already. We couldn‚Äôt bring her back, couldn‚Äôt change what happened. What was done was done. I kept thinking about Darryl‚Äôs wife, the baby on the way... Lot of fallout, man. Didn‚Äôt want to see more lives be destroyed in the process.‚Äù\n\nAdam stares a hole in the carpet, shaking his head. ‚ÄúI felt responsible, you know? I introduced Darryl to that stupid app. If it hadn‚Äôt been for all my bragging about banging chicks that I met on Tinder...‚Äù \n\nI don‚Äôt want to hear apologies and excuses. ‚ÄúWhat did you do with the body?‚Äù I ask, curtly.\n\n‚ÄúI told Darryl we‚Äôd take care of it, and we did. We buried her in the woods a few miles from the house.‚Äù\n\nI imagine being dumped into a shallow grave, the world unaware of what happened to me. Just another missing person in a long line of missing people. I know I‚Äôd want my story to be told and for the truth to come out. \n\nWill Akasha stop seeking retribution if we find her body? Will she accept that she‚Äôs dead and move on to whatever‚Äôs next?\n\nI notice a strange look of determination in Adam‚Äôs eyes. Then it hits me ‚Äî he hasn‚Äôt finished telling the story. There‚Äôs one final part of Akasha‚Äôs dark tale that remains untold. Having come this far, he wants to go all the way and get it off his chest. \n\n‚ÄúSomething else happened that night,‚Äù I say, to prompt him.\n\n‚ÄúI was worried that someone might find the body and be able to identify Akasha‚Äôs remains. After we put her in the ground, I went back to my Jeep and got the emergency gas tank.‚Äù\n\nDread spikes inside me. I‚Äôm about to receive the chilling final piece of the puzzle. \n\n‚ÄúDarryl dumped the gas all over her body. I was going to use my lighter, but I quit smoking a couple months earlier. There were some matches in the glove box, though...‚Äù\n\nAdam takes a deep breath. ‚ÄúDarryl was too much of a mess at that point, so it was up to me. This was a cold, windy night. The first couple of times, the match didn‚Äôt stay lit. You know what they say ‚Äî third time‚Äôs the charm.‚Äù \n\nOnce again I can vividly picture the scene. I see the match catching fire as if I‚Äôm standing next to Adam. I see it falling into the open grave. Flames ignite on Akasha‚Äôs gasoline-soaked body... \n\n‚ÄúShe went up almost instantaneously.‚Äù Adam lets out a heaving sob that shakes his whole body. The next words come sudden and sharp. ‚ÄúAll of a sudden she was screaming! I can still hear her. Oh my God, I swear we thought she was dead‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nAdam‚Äôs hands are trembling now and his face has turned to marble. A shudder ripples through me as the full horror of what happened that night is finally revealed.\n\nNo wonder Akasha is torching men like Adam.\n\nShe was burned alive.",

        "text": "\n\nYears ago, when I still went to school my parents used to move around a lot. My mother had to  change jobs often and it was my dad's fault , due to his own job. At the time the story happened, we were looking at yet another relocation, planned months in advance. \n\nI was a not very successful 9- grader. In total we have been staying at this place for 4 years, living at the 6th floor of a 9 -floor building.\n\nThings would have been doable but in the apartment above us there lived an old woman, a hag if you will. At first glance you could think she had gone entirely insane. In the summer the window of my room was always open and due this our entire family could hear her talk all the time. She would spontaneously start monologuing and just as spontaneously she would stop. She would start talking in her apartment in the middle of the night and as if to piss everyone off she would do it more often than during the day. Her day didn't have any structure, she was free to do as she pleased. She would talk about things no one understood, trying to get someone to understand her in her own very confusing way. The locals didn't pay attention to her at all, force of habit, I think. But I woke up a few times in the middle of the night, that's how loud she was talking.  I have to admit I was really scared because she changed her voice a lot and you could have the impression that different people were upstairs.\n\nOne evening I was at home alone, killing time in front of the PC as usual. I was lost in thought as I suddenly heard scratches on our front door. Confused, I approached our door and looked through the spy. There stood the old woman from upstairs. I slightly opened the door but couldn't say a word as she interrupted me.\n\n\"You stole from me! Return my gold!\" She spoke with a voice full of malice.\n\nI wasn't sure what to reply to this, it happened so fast. She on the other hand kept talking as if having forgotten what she said a few seconds ago.\n\n\" My little son Alex, where have you been?\" She inquired, her face assuming an entirely different expression.\n\n\" I'm sorry but my name is Eugene!\"  I replied. But she just kept talking as if she knew what I would say.\n\n\" I have several of you, I can't remember everyone!\" She squeezed the words from her barely parted lips before turning around and walking back upstairs. I did not understand what she came for but I have to admit I felt uncomfortable after that conversation. There was something in her eyes that was beyond insanity, as if something from within her consciousness was successfully manipulating her. Forcing the philosophical thoughts out of my mind I returned to my PC. Strangely, there was nothing to hear from her till the evening.\n\nI couldn't fall asleep for half the night. At one moment,  silence descended upon the room as if someone had cast a spell. But it was not a normal silence. I had the feeling that I got tossed in a vacuum or worse, had gone entirely deaf. As if nothing has changed but the silence was entirely within my head. I kept listening intently but didn't pick up any sounds except my own breath which for some reason annoyed me immensely. Those moments felt like a calm before the storm, as if something was bound to happen any moment.\n\nFrustratingly my expectations came true, I heard steps upstairs and the woman started to speak.\n\n\"You will kill me! I know! Leave me alone, I am fed up with this!\" she spoke with a voice that grew ever louder.\n\nHaving barely finished the sentence she continued in a changed voice .\n\n\" Why do you act this way around us dear, your dad is still with us, I'll tell on you and he'll punish you!\" she spoke in a slightly lisping voice.\n\nBut all those changes faded to nothing as she, after standing there in complete silence for a minute suddenly started yelling loudly and incomprehensibly. She was either threatening someone or trying to scare something off. Despite all her quirks I have never experienced her acting like this. After the yelling I heard a loud thud as if something fell onto the floor, something very heavy. After this the night was quiet again. I kept trying to listen to something but all I heard were some light steps and I have never heard anything of the kind before. I must have dozed off at some point.\n\nIn the morning I woke up with a horrible headache. For the first time I felt happy going to school. I didn't tell my parents because I knew they have other things on their mind right now. I also knew that my dad hated talking about these things. I wasn't paying attention as I gathered my things and left. Strangely I felt better after a few steps away from the house. Maybe the fresh air did me good or the change of scenery.\n\nThe day went by without anything strange happening, aside from the fact that time somehow seemed to pass way quicker. I was so distracted by my studies that I barely noticed that it was time to go back home. Usually I would be the first one out of the school door but not today.\n\nWhen I returned home I was greeted by deadly silence as usual. Only the clock  in the hallway kept counting down seconds. I caught myself wishing for a cat so I wouldn't be so lonely.\n\nEntering my room I noticed with surprise how messy it was. My things were thrown all around, the bedsheets  crumpled up, some kinds of strange marks everywhere. I didn't pay it much attention, instead thinking \"challenge accepted\" and shifting into cleaning mode. To not get bored I put up music on my PC and pumped up the volume. During my cleanup I was confused several times as I kept finding my things in such spaces that it seemed as if someone was deliberately hiding them from me.\n\nAfter a few minutes I heard loud knocking from above. Apparently the woman disapproved of the loud music. To get back at her, as form of petty revenge I turned the volume up even more. It felt good getting some payback for the night plus I wasn't doing anything illegal.\n\nAfter a minute the knocking stopped and I figured she got tired. Having pity on the old lady plus having finished the cleanup I turned off the music and decided to rest.\n\nI laid down on the bed, having put my phone on charge and got lost in my thoughts. After a while I noticed that it was time for the old woman's talk again but she was silent . My window was open but instead of her gibberish I heard children playing outside and people talking. It was a welcome change I thought as I drifted off to sleep.\n\nI rarely dream but maybe because of last night or some other reasons this was one of those rare occasions. In my dream I was going on about my day, seeing glimpses and bits of it. But in the entire dream I was not alone. It is a feeling I have difficulties to express. As if some unknown entity was following me from a distance. And as the day progressed the world around me kept getting smaller , effectively bringing the observing entity closer to me. I was really scared, especially when in my dream I entered my room I got this overwhelming feeling that I was caught in a trap and someone has been waiting...\n\nI woke up to the entrance door to our apartment slamming. Struggling to open my eyes I looked at my phone and wondered about two things. Number one: apparently I slept for several hours which means I will be having difficulties falling asleep again. And number two: my phone was disconnected from my charger and the charger was lying in the corner of the room.\n\nGetting up I felt how cold it was in my room. I blamed the open window yet as I moved to close it I felt the warm breeze of wind from outside. It was warmer outside than in my room. I have no idea why it was cold in my room specifically but as I went to my parents I felt warm again.\n\nMy mother and father were fighting about something and it has been a while since such heavy conflicts occurred in our family. They never led to anything good anyway. After a few more words my father left the room, preferring to withdraw from supper and my mother's company. My mom warmed up the food and we set down. I tried to tell her about what happened today but she just kept showing her disinterest in listening to me. I finished my supper in silence, thanked my mom and went to my room.\n\nI decided to spend the evening preparing for the math exam tomorrow. I did a few math exercises and solved some equations. Having finished that I laid down and tried to sleep and to my surprise I fell asleep very quickly..\n\nI don't remember the dreams I had but I only remember it was unpleasant. A persistent and somehow strange sound from upstairs woke me up. Again I had difficulties opening my eyes, my entire body was shivering. Touching my forehead I felt it was wet and immediately thought that I am drenched in sweat due to my nightmares. Yet as my eyes adjusted to darkness I noticed a big wet spot on the ceiling directly over my bed.\n\n\"The old hag has forgotten to turn off the faucet and is ruining our ceiling!\" I exclaimed before stumbling towards the light switch, my entire body aching and exhausted. As I flipped the lights on , my attention focused on the wet spot on the ceiling..there was nothing! I stood there, staring at the space where the spot used to be and couldn't believe my eyes. I was sure I saw it. I was shocked but after a while I laid back down on the bed without turning the lights off. I kept staring at the ceiling and the second I closed my eyes the woman started talking again.\n\n\" Leave me alone, you bastard! You killed me! Go to hell!\" Her voice sounded somehow unnatural, hoarse and malicious.  I was scared of the words she spoke and debated with myself whether I should tell my parents about it. But I was convinced they wouldn't believe me and didn't want to hear what my father would say. After some time of lying there indecisively  I must have fallen asleep again.\n\nThe next thing I remember was the annoying melody of my alarm. I had a horrible headache and wasn't sure if any of it was real. Despite feeling awful I decided to go to school and skipped breakfast to get out of the house quickly . Contrary to my expectations the day went by fine, I did good on the exams and met up with some friends for a few beers later.\n\nAs I came home it was dark. I was steeling myself for the atmosphere of discord between my parents and was pleasantly surprised to find them together and not fighting. We even had a visitor, a neighbour lady who liked to gossip.\n\nI barely closed the door behind me when they called me to them. After a pause, my father told me that the neighbour upstairs died a few days ago, directly in her room. Apparently some of the people who looked after her now and then became alarmed and discovered her. I wanted to tell them about what I heard and experienced but decided against it.\n\nA month later I was at home again, minding my own business. There was no more talking or noise upstairs. Also no new neighbors, the apartment remained empty. I was exiting the kitchen when I heard scratches at the front door.\n\nI was feeling uneasy as I peeked through the spy. In front of our door was the old woman who immediately turned around and went upstairs. I have never been so afraid before or after than in this moment. I felt hot and cold as I heard steps in the apartment above and they stopped directly above my room.\n\nUp until us moving out I kept hearing the scratches on the front door.

        "text": "What is a home [anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/111mjb1/my_wife_wont_stop_licking_the_walls_of_our_new/)? Is it just four walls and a lock? Is it a crippling financial obligation under the promise that one will stay still? Is it the place where you can hang up your hat and feel loved? Could it be a terrible amalgamation of al ofl the above?\n\n*Home is where I feel safe*, reads the ever-changing definition projected onto the wall of the gallery. *Home is where I feel loved*.\n\nHome is decidedly not where I feel safe. There is no love in my home.\n\nOnly lust.\n\nThe name of the exhibition is *Prague of Tomorrow ‚Äî Houses and Apartments*. Images of what was, what is and what could come flash across the walls. Above me, in a language I cannot comprehend, a dozen voices discuss the housing crisis. Had I known the topic of the installation I would have stayed out on the street. As convincing as the graphs projected onto the walls are, the concept of a looming housing crisis seems impossible to grasp.\n\nThere‚Äôs a more intimate crisis that my mind is occupied by ‚Äî The crisis of my marriage.  \n\nOne of the exhibition employees comes to ask me if I have any questions. He speaks to me in English without asking me where I‚Äôm from. He‚Äôs friendly enough, but when I tell him that I recently bought property in Prague his eyes narrow. He asks me if it‚Äôs an investment apartment or if I plan to live on the property. When I tell him me and my wife live in the apartment he smiles and nods and walks off to question other guests.\n\nI don‚Äôt mention the third occupant of our home. The mere thought of the third member of our relationship drives me to the brink of madness.\n\nThe wall clears again. Pictures of homely apartments are replaced by smashed up beer bottles and drunk tourists and genitals keyed into ancient stone. A young couple stands next to me, quietly chatting in Czech. As the images of destruction on the wall turn more and more dire the couple goes quiet.\n\n‚ÄòFuck Airbnb,‚Äô the woman finally mumbles when a map of apartments where the locals can‚Äôt live glows red on the wall.\n\nThe man notices me watching them. He says something to me in Czech. When I tell him I don‚Äôt speak the language he says something else to me in Czech, something considerably less friendly. Just as I fear a physical confrontation my phone rings. I excuse myself and scurry out of the exhibition space.\n\nI have seventeen missed calls from my wife since I fled our home this morning. I stare at my phone until the total turns to eighteen. After three years of marriage, I know that talking to her is a bad idea. I know she would calm me down and make me think that my fear of the apartment is just a gross overreaction. I know she could make me forget and relax and ignore the lunacy that exists beyond our front door.\n\nThe lingering taste of plaster on my tongue reminds me that my fear is no simple hysteria. The taste of plaster reminds me that I am in danger.\n\n‚ÄòJim?‚Äô a familiar voice calls from the gallery‚Äôs workspace, ‚ÄòWhat are you doing here?‚Äô\n\nJana stands behind me, laptop bag across her shoulder, smiling. I try to speak, but my words turn to babbles. All I manage to get out of me is my wife‚Äôs name. Jana‚Äôs shoulders slump and her smile fades. She asks me if I want a drink.\n\nThere‚Äôs some obscure saint on my cider bottle but he doesn‚Äôt last long. As I tell Jana of the previous night my fingers work independently of my mind and strip the bottle bare. When we first sit down in the garden area outside of the gallery, I promise myself that I‚Äôll keep my composure but after only a handful of sentences my eyes fill with tears.\n\nI tell Jana everything. I tell her I think my wife is being unfaithful with a ghost that has possessed our home.\n\nHad Jana laughed, had Jana showed the slightest bit of skepticism about my theories ‚Äî my mind would calm. Yet she doesn‚Äôt, as I talk about the horrors of my homelife she simply nods in understanding. When I finish my story, she offers me tissues and a cigarette and then Jana asks me the question that has been haunting me ever since I fled our home this morning.\n\n‚ÄòWhat are you going to do?‚Äô\n\nI suck on the rest of my bottle like a thirsty infant, hoping that the cider will blossom answers in my head. It doesn‚Äôt. Instead, another question manifests itself. A thought just as vile as the visions of the tenderness my wife has shared with the apartment walls. A thought so dark and discomforting that merely giving it life with my lips makes my hands shake.\n\n‚ÄòI think she wants to get rid of me,‚Äô I say.\n\n‚ÄòLike, get divorced?‚Äô Jana asks.\n\nI shake my head.\n\nHer immediate response, again, doesn‚Äôt calm me. At the assertion that my wife might be planning to make me disappear Jana furrows her brow and thinks hard. It is only after a couple drags of her cigarette that she shakes her head.\n\n‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think she would do that,‚Äô Jana finally says. ‚ÄòI couldn‚Äôt imagine her killing a person. Animals, yes. They killed animals in the sacrifice circles all the time. People, no. That would be too much, even for her‚Ä¶ Even for Bo≈ôivoj.‚Äô\n\nJana saying his name sends a shiver down my spine. Her half-hearted presumption that neither my wife, nor her dead lover, would be capable of murdering me doesn‚Äôt make the situation any better. \n\nMy phone rings. I stare at the screen.\n\n‚ÄòYou should talk to her about it,‚Äô Jana says. ‚ÄòIn person,‚Äô she adds, when my phone screen goes dark.\n\n‚ÄòWhat if she‚Äôll try to kill me?‚Äô I ask.\n\n‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think she will,‚Äô she replies, without much conviction. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sure you two can talk it out and come to some sort of an arrangement. What else is there to do?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòI could find some sort of ghost hunter.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt do that here.‚Äô\n\nFor a split second I consider checking Google, but I‚Äôm too ashamed to do it in front of Jana. Instead, I ask for a cigarette. The crisis of my marriage drains away any chance of small-talk.\n\nAs I sit on the subway on my way back home, I can‚Äôt help but to feel that the dark tunnels of wire and metal are closing in on me. Barreling through the underground in a metal tube filled with strangers, I feel like I‚Äôm on the edge of a mental breakdown. The tightness in my chest reaches even greater heights when I get past the doors of the apartment complex and enter the elevator.\n\nScarcely clothed and with her skin wet with sweat, she greets me at the door. My wife doesn‚Äôt mention my disappearance, or the twenty missed calls on my phone, or any of the maddening things that happened the night prior. She simply kisses my cheek, grabs my hand and leads me to the bedroom under promises of pleasure. The lights of our bedroom are off and the blinds are pulled. \n\nThe room is dark, yet even in that darkness I can see the dirty walls shifting.\n\nWhen I first protest, she acts like she can‚Äôt hear me. When I tell her I am certain that the apartment is being haunted by her dead lover and that she has been unfaithful to me with his ghost, she laughs. It‚Äôs not until I flick on the lights in the bedroom that my wife‚Äôs tone changes.\n\nThe walls are covered in splotches of wetness that constrict and expand to the rhythm of foreign sluggish lungs. When I point at the madness surrounding us and demand answers, all the humor drains from her face. She demands I either let go of my bizarre paranoia and get into bed or that I spend the night theorizing on the couch. Then, without either of us touching the light switch, the room goes dark.\n\nHearing her be displeased with me hurts on a level I cannot articulate. I briefly make an attempt to evacuate all theories of infidelity or danger out of my skull. It is futile. No amount of mental gymnastics can make me blind to what is obvious. Our bedroom smells of fresh sex and I share no responsibility. With molten lead dripping down my throat, I retreat to the couch.\n\nThere‚Äôs still a little bit of whiskey left in the bottle and in the incense holder that has been demoted to an ashtray sits a half-smoked cigarette. The alcohol and nicotine numb my mind somewhat yet all my progress towards sanity is undone by a forceful slam of the bedroom door.\n\nI did not hear my wife get out of bed. There is no draft that would move the doors so violently. I have no doubts about who shut me off from my partner. I clutch my drink and fill my lungs, knowing that I am not welcome in my own bed. The pit of despair I am sinking into is bottomless, yet in the calm stillness of the night a gentle sound rips me from my paralysis.\n\nI hear her moan. She sounds like she‚Äôs in pain.\n\nI hear my wife moan from the bedroom and long dormant parts of my brain light up in feverish primordial instincts to defend. I leap from the couch and dash towards the door, but I do not get far. Just a couple steps from the couch I crash to the floor, ruining the coffee table we received as a wedding gift from my brother.\n\nI try to get up, but I cannot.\n\nFrom the wall, throbbing with the same measured pace like the wet blemishes of our bedroom, extends a horrid tentacle of soft cement. After my fall, for a mere moment, my wife‚Äôs moans go silent. I call out to her, I beg her to help me, to be witness to the horrors which the apartment has unleashed on me. \n\nShe does not respond. Instead, she starts to moan once more.\n\nI try to rip myself free of the eldritch appendage which holds me to the ground. At first the task seems possible; the strands of the incomprehensible tentacle are slick and give away to my fingers. Yet just as I am about to free myself of the maddening embrace, the tentacle hardens into stone.\n\nI scream as I feel the bones in my wrist start to give out. My wife too, screams in the bedroom. Yet as the shock of sudden agony clears from my mind, I realize her screams are not ones of pain. \n\nI hear her moan his name. I hear her moan the name which my tongue cannot pronounce.\n\nWhen I stop resisting the tentacle, it grows soft once more. It grows gentle. The horrid strand of living cement is still my captor, yet it touches me with the tenderness of a lover. It rubs my wrist in delicate circles as I weep to the sounds of pleasure echoing through my apartment.\n\nWhen the deed is done, gently, I am pulled back onto the couch. In sheer terror I keep my eyes shut. Soft hands brush through my hair, as if I was a bedridden child in desperate need of sleep. I do not resist them. I am incapable of opposing the forces which have stolen the reigns of my life.\n\nWhen I wake, I wake in pain. My body is more sore than the night before, the horrid artificial taste of plaster is on my tongue once more, the hangover I developed is amplified. When I wake, I wake in pain, but I wake to her smile.\n\nShe brings me coffee and breakfast to the couch and apologizes for acting so strangely over the past couple of weeks. She provides no explanation and the tenacity of her apology is leagues away from her sins, but I accept it. I accept her apology because there‚Äôs something in her voice, something in those beautiful piercing eyes and heavenly smile that I cannot resist.\n\nWarm morning light fills the room and for a moment it feels like things are as they were back home. My wife does not comment on the broken coffee table or the black bruise on my wrist, she simply talks about how happy the two of us will be in Prague. Deep inside I know that there is a cancer growing within our relationship that is terminal. I know that we are well past the point of no return, but I cannot bring myself to put an end to the tranquil moment.\n\nInstead of asking my wife about the ghost which haunts our apartment, I get up to make myself a second cup of coffee. From the kitchen, I ask her if she wants another cup as well. \n\nShe doesn‚Äôt answer. Instead, she saunters over to the kitchen and plants a kiss on my lips. She holds me tight and shows me more affection than she has since we reached Prague. Only then, in our tight embrace, does she tell me that she would like a second cup of coffee, but that she would rather abstain.\n\nOnly then, does she tell me that she is [pregnant](https://www.reddit.com/r/MJLPresents/comments/11dqjap/i_think_my_wife_might_be_being_unfaithful/).",

        "text": "January 18, 2023\n\n Something's wrong with my friends Bill and Rob. They're cousins, or maybe brothers-in-law; I'm not totally sure. They don't seem like either though; they seem more like old buddies who've known each other since they were kids.\n\n   Lately though, Bill and Rob haven't been acting right. It's not as if they're not themselves. Bill is still sweet, kind, quiet Bill, and Rob is still funny, excitable, smiley Rob. Bill is just quieter and more tired, and Rob is a bit louder and more excitable. I'm just worried because every time I see them they're like this. They also seem to get more easily annoyed with each other.\n\nJanuary 19, 2023\n\n Today I saw Bill and Rob in a shouting match. They've never done that before. Usually their arguments and disagreements are kept quiet and just talked about, but today they were screaming at each other. I don't have second hand embarrassment from everyone staring at them, far from it actually. I'm far more scared because I thought I heard Bill whisper to Rob (after their fight) that he was going to skin him and wear him as a coat.\n\nFebruary 16, 2023\n\n I'm really excited! I have a race soon on the 18th and 19th. I get Friday off of school too to travel up to Priest Lake. I like getting days off of school. I hope Bill and Rob figured out whatever was going on with them. It's kind of scary, them yelling at each other. I think I misheard what Bill said though, he's really not like that. It just wouldn't make sense.\n\nFebruary 18, 2023\n\n Bill and Rob are both here; it seems like they're doing better too, mostly at least. I think Bill had another spat with his wife. That happens sometimes. It worries me, though, that Rob seems to be a bit out of sorts. He's less excited than usual; more sad even. Blue isn't his color, but red is! He was wearing his signature San Francisco's 49er's hat. I think I might ask him what's going on tomorrow.\n\nFebruary 19, 2023\n\n So I asked, because of course I did. He would only say he's going through a bit of a rough time. I asked if he and Bill were doing okay. He just looked at me and shrugged. Maybe they're not doing so good after all. I don't know what I should do. Anyway, I asked if they were gonna go to the Sumpter race in a couple weeks. Bill said sure, and Rob smiled and said maybe. I hope they show up.\n\nFebruary 24, 2023\n\n Bill's here, but Rob's not. He said Rob couldn't get the time off of work. That's okay though cause Bill's here! He seemed excited to be at this race. I sure hope his sleds don't break, they have a tendency to do that.\n\nFebruary 25, 2023\n\n Today is race day! I'm here with my 78‚Äô Yamaha Exciter 340, and I am so ready to win.\n\n Okay, so it's the end of the day now, I did the math, and I went around that track 51 times. Six races. Three laps in heats, five in mains. Oh, and an LCQ. That's double my usual amount of laps. Bill was really tired this morning; he almost didn't go to tech check, which was weird, but I guess he's more old and tired without Rob to keep him jumping around? Maybe that's why he's been getting so mad at Rob; he just doesn't want to run around that much. I'm not sure. I talked to him and he said he'd see me next year so that's cool! I told him to say hi to Rob for me, and he said he would. So maybe they're doing better? I hope so.\n\n‚Äî\n\n Bill's here. Rob's not. Bill's coat looks weird today. It's thin and a weird grayish-tan color. It's also got a very gray, fluffy hood. It's kind of a weird hood. It looks like Rob's hair when he puts it on. Bill's still old and tired, but now he's got this weird look in his eyes. I can't pinpoint what it is.\n\n‚Äî\n\n He just came up to me. I feel disgusted. He put the hood and Rob‚Äôs 49er's hat on his head and said hi. He was still Bill, but it felt like he was pretending to be Rob. \n\n Oh God. I just looked at the sleeves. They have the fingerless hand things on the end. They look like real hands. I don't think I misheard him last year. I think his whispered threat wasn't a threat at all: It was a promise. I think he skinned Rob and made him into a coat.",

        "text": "We never thought our daughter would be capable of harm. \n\nThat doesn‚Äôt excuse our actions. What we‚Äôve willfully ignored over the years, that‚Äôs unforgivable. But I hope any parent reading this can at least relate to the overwhelming feeling that your child, no matter how monstrous, will always be innocent in your eyes.\n\nWe‚Äôd been trying for years to have one of our own. My husband, Dave, and me. So long, in fact, that sex had become like another occupation for us. We tracked my menstrual cycle. Waited for ovulation days when I‚Äôd pee on a stick and get a positive result. Then we‚Äôd make our way to *pound-town*, revisiting as often as we could to cut my dodgy egg off at the pass, until we were both wholly exhausted from the effort.  \n\nIt was like that, every month, for at least a year and a half. It took as long for us to accept that we couldn‚Äôt get pregnant on our own. Our sex, our bodies, would not be enough. \n\nDave found us a fertility clinic. A friend of his who‚Äôd also struggled recommended it. I felt relieved to finally acknowledge we needed the help. Answering those questions during our first consultation at the clinic was like a confessional. \n\nYes, I did have an STD once. *Okay*, twice... Yes, I am not getting enough exercise during the week‚Ä¶ Yes, my diet is heavily carb-based. And yes, I would do anything, change anything, be anything, to have a baby.  \n\nWe held nothing back. We did all their tests. Explored every option. Spent all of our savings. And two years later, after pouring all of us into the pursuit of a baby bump, nothing. \n\nI remember Dave holding me the day the IVF didn‚Äôt work, the two of us standing in the corridor of the clinic just holding each other. I remember repeating the words we‚Äôd said so many times together‚Äì*this isn‚Äôt our fault*‚Äìwhile still feeling like an absolute fucking failure. \n\nThat‚Äôs where she found us, our fertility specialist, at the bottom of a well. She offered her sympathies there in the corridor.  Her eyes glassy, voice tight in her throat. She‚Äôd been with us through so much the loss had impacted her as well. \n\nWe thanked her for her condolences, then started for the exit. There was no more emotion left in either of us, no more tears, just cold acceptance. We were officially an *infertile couple*. \n\nAs we neared the exit, our specialist called out after us. \n\n‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt need to be the end.‚Äù \n\nI stopped while Dave kept on, either not hearing or not wanting to. The specialist was still standing right where we left her. So I let go of Dave‚Äôs hand and wandered back over to her. \n\n‚ÄúI appreciate all you‚Äôve done,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI really do. But we‚Äôre completely out of money, and honestly, I don‚Äôt think this was ever going to happen for us.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúI know of a place,‚Äù she started, her voice just above a whisper. ‚ÄúAn institute that might be able to help with your situation.‚Äù\n\nDave was waiting at the exit, ready to leave. I signaled for him to wait just another minute. He shook his head, frustrated, ready to move on. \n\n‚ÄúHelp us, how?‚Äù I asked. \n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs highly experimental. The consent forms are insane. NDAs, all that kinda stuff. But the procedure worked for another infertile couple of mine. It actually worked, Elle.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúThey got pregnant?‚Äù \n\nShe paused for a moment, then chose her words carefully. ‚ÄúThey have a child, yes.‚Äù \n\nThis jolted me. I was so sure at this point that I didn‚Äôt have any hope left, and yet, at the very mention of another chance, I was back at the poker table, ready to go all in again. \n\nDave took more convincing. I think in his mind he‚Äôd moved on a long time ago without telling me, so he wasn‚Äôt all that interested in trying another route, especially one that would require an NDA. But the longer he sat in the possibility of it - *a baby of our own* \\- he was willing to quiet his reservations and give this experimental hail mary a shot. \n\nWe arrived at the address. It was one of those generic office buildings you see off the freeway, just another glass monolith that held a variety of businesses inside. We took the elevator to the seventh floor, and opened the doors to The Nova Institute.  \n\n*Ectogenesis*. An artificial womb outside of the body. What NVI offered us, *the infertiles*, was the possibility of successful reproduction. \n\nWe took the informational packet home in a state of disbelief. After years of grasping for an ounce of control, suddenly we had control over everything. They even had a section in the packet where you could list the traits you‚Äôd like to see most pronounced in your offspring.\n\nWe laughed at the absurdity of it all. And then we drank. And drank some more. \n\n‚ÄúShe should have your nose,‚Äù I said, slurring a bit. ‚ÄúNot my goblin hook.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúWhat, no, I love your goblin hook,‚Äù Dave responded. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs also getting your teeth.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShe can have my teeth, but not my nose.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúHow do you feel about freckles?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúYours are adorable.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúLike a full body spread or just sprinkled around?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúMaybe a darker pigmentation in general to lessen the chance of melanoma?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSo fucking smart, yes!‚Äù \n\nBack and forth we went, designing our baby together, like we were suddenly in that 90s Ethan Hawke movie. We wanted our baby‚Äôs traits to resemble ours, for the genetic similarities to be obvious to family and friends, but we also wanted her to have her own unique attributes. A body lovingly designed by us but one that belonged entirely to her. \n\nHarper. Her name would be Harper and she would pluck every chord of our heartstrings. All we had to do was to sign on the many dotted lines. The absurdity waned at some point and all we were left with was an inevitable choice. \n\nHarper was pulled from her artificial womb on a Tuesday morning in late December. \n\nWe were going for a Christmas baby but circumstances pushed the due date up a week. According to NVI, she developed faster than anticipated and was starting to tear the uterine tissues with the powerful strokes of her sport-ready limbs. \n\nI was the first to hold her. Her eyes held the emerald glow of my late mothers. In my arms, my history, my future - all of it, all of me. I couldn‚Äôt stop the tears if I tried. And as I leaned back into Dave‚Äôs chest, we both witnessed the most incredible thing. Harper‚Äôs eyes, they locked onto mine, and filled with tears of her own. Our baby, we were so connected already. \n\nWe left their neonatal ward with the contractual understanding that we would only contact the pediatricians in their network should anything be out of the ordinary. Though that line between ordinary and atypical proved difficult to identify, especially considering we‚Äôd  just walked out of a lab with a baby hatched from a biobag. So we were pretty much off book from the jump. \n\nOn the first night in her nursery, Harper slept nearly fifteen hours straight without moving once. Even after repeated assurances from NVI that this kind of comatose state was perfectly normal during the first phase of an *ecto‚Äôs* development, several times throughout the night, Dave and I found ourselves hunched over her crib, our hands inches from her nose to feel the wisp of warm breath against our knuckles. \n\nShe was fine. This was all fine, we tried assuring ourselves rather aggressively.  \n\nSomehow, we‚Äôd managed to convince our family and friends that Harper had been born from a surrogate mother. It was a lie, sure, but one we could live with. It was that or try and wade into an ethical minefield with the people we love. Everyone was just so happy for us anyway they didn‚Äôt bother to ask many questions. When Dave‚Äôs mother finally got a chance to hold Harper, I remember her saying the word, ‚Äúperfect,‚Äù over and over again. \n\nAnd to us, Harper was perfect. We were both on leave from our jobs for those first few months, so our baby girl was our entire world. Our friends had warned us that month one through three came at you like a wrecking ball, but that wasn‚Äôt our experience at all. \n\nHarper took to the bottle of NVI-engineered formula immediately. Gained enough weight to get those adorable baby rolls. Slept through the night. And never, ever cried. \n\nThat last part was a bit uncomfortable at times. But again, we‚Äôd been assured that her development would not be like other children, so as strange as it was, it still felt right to us. \n\nIn full transparency, there were some other early warning signs I actively chose to ignore. Moments with Harper during her first years of her life where I felt this lurking sense that something might be very wrong with our daughter.\n\nOne night, for example, and I‚Äôm not proud to admit this, I pulled Harper roughly out of her crib hoping she would fuss or cry in my arms. Up until that point, I‚Äôd been able to let go of most parental expectations, but I couldn't surpress the desire for her to need me, and that started to come out in weird ways. Like waking her up in the middle of the night just to rock her back to sleep. \n\nHarper‚Äôs eyes peeled open. They found mine. Instead of fussing she just stared back at me without expression as if she understood exactly what this late-night intrusion was all about.\n\nI felt a coldness dig into my chest. It rippled through my body, swirling up to my head, wrapping around my brain, like the tendrils of a vine. \n\nAnd that‚Äôs when I heard it, a voice booming inside me. Piercing. Spiteful. \n\n‚Äú*RELEASE ME.‚Äù* \n\nI immediately stood from the chair. Set Harper down in her crib with odd, jerky motions. Then staggered off toward the door, bumping into walls, as if walking for the first time. \n\nIt wasn‚Äôt until I was halfway to my bedroom that I started to wonder what exactly had just happened. I slipped into bed beside Dave and decided not to wake him. Instead, I closed my eyes and willed myself to forget the whole thing. \n\nBut the frequency of these kinds of occurrences become difficult to ignore. \n\nOne night, as Dave tells it, while I was out for work drinks, he was deciding between *Giving Tree* and *Rainbow Fish* for a bedtime story, when he was struck by a sudden desire to introduce more complex ideas to Harper. \n\nHe carried her into his study and pulled down an earmarked, heavily-noted copy of *The Fountainhead*. They stayed awake hours after her bedtime, Harper unmoving in his arms, while Dave read the chapters aloud, entranced by the act of revealing an individual‚Äôs true worth to our daughter‚Äôs developing mind. \n\nThat‚Äôs where I found him, working his way through the final chapters with Harper sitting up in his lap. I grabbed Dave‚Äôs arm when he wouldn‚Äôt respond to my voice. After some vigorous shaking, he finally snapped out of it. I asked questions he couldn‚Äôt fully answer. \n\nAnd then there was the incident of the popsicle in the park. \n\nWe agreed on no sugar for the first few months of her development. We had even signed a form that we'd keep her diet to the NVI-formula until she was at least six months of age. But while walking through a local park with Harper strapped to my chest, I found myself inexplicably drawn to an ice cream cart. \n\nAfter unwrapping a rainbow-colored frozen treat on a bench, my thoughts turned to Harper, and only her. I wanted her to partake in the joy of tasting a popsicle on a warm summer afternoon. Screw the contracts, I wanted my baby girl to devour the damn thing whole. \n\nWhen Dave found us, returning from his tennis match in the park, I was seated on a bench absently holding the popsicle out for Harper to eat. Her face and onesie stained red.\n\n‚ÄúI thought she wasn‚Äôt supposed to‚Äì‚Äù \n\n‚Äú*FUCK OFF,*‚Äù I yelled in a voice I didn‚Äôt recognize. \n\n‚Äú...What?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúOh god. Why did I just‚Ä¶ What am I doing, Dave?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just get her cleaned up. We have our appointment in an hour.‚Äù  \n\nFor as often as we were caught in these uncomfortable situations, the short explanation, the one that stuck most often, was that neither of us knew what parenting would be like, so maybe grappling with these powerful, irrational desires was familiar to all who raised a kid.\n\nOr maybe‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it going?‚Äù the Nova pediatrician asked, during our appointment. \n\n‚ÄúWonderfully,‚Äù I responded. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs everything we hoped she would be. And more.‚Äù \n\n*‚ÄúAnd more,*‚Äù Dave parroted, giving my hand a loving squeeze. \n\nBoth of us were a little terrified of what might happen if we were honest about our experiences with Harper, so we focused on the positives and shared only what painted our family in the best possible light. \n\nAfter a brief physical during which Harper lay motionless on the examination table, the pediatrician was satisfied with the results. So satisfied, in fact, that they wanted to introduce us to other couples who were also raising ecto children. \n\n‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre learning,‚Äù started the pediatrician, ‚Äúthere are tremendous benefits to socialization between ectos. Both for the children, as well as the parents. What you are going through, each of you, is truly unique. I mean, there hasn‚Äôt been anything like this in human history. So, yeah, we‚Äôre recommending play-dates.‚Äù \n\nShe winked at us with a smile. And we smiled back at her. Everything was exactly as it should be.\n\nThe drive to the house in the hills was unbearably tense. \n\nWe had received the numbers of other couples with ecto children. We started a group text and one of the parents eventually offered to host a meet-up. \n\nHarper had just turned three and was selectively mute. She only used language to underscore a point she was trying to make with nonverbal cues. There were other anomalies about her. In truth, they seemed to metastasize by the day. We worried she would be the odd ecto out. \n\n‚ÄúHere we are,‚Äù Dave said in an overly chipper voice.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the one,‚Äù I responded, my voice shaky. ‚ÄúWhat a beautiful home.‚Äù \n\nLater in the day, several parents circled up around a sandbox shaped like a turtle, watching our kids stare at each other with quiet stoicism. \n\nI found it comforting to know that Harper wasn‚Äôt the only one uninterested in playtime. I could tell the other parents in our huddle felt exactly the same. Turns out, we were all comparing our children to each other‚Äôs, and that did normalize it some, at least for me. \n\nOne of the other moms turned to me during a lull in the conversation. We had bonded earlier over a youtube channel we let our children watch against regulation, admitting we even spoke in the voice of the host at times at home, so she was ready to get a little more personal with me. \n\n‚ÄúCan I ask you something about Harper?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúAnything,‚Äù I said, unconvincingly. \n\n‚ÄúI know this is gonna sound completely bananas, but‚Ä¶ have you ever heard her say something to you without, like, using her voice?‚Äù\n\nI felt the blood immediately leave my head. My breath locked in my chest. \n\n‚Äú...Have you ever heard your daughter speak to you inside your head?‚Äù \n\nHer eyes were searching mine. Desperate for someone to tell her she was not alone in this. Of course I knew exactly what she was talking about, but all I wanted to do at that moment was tell her she was *bananas* and probably just needed more sleep.  \n\nAs I fumbled to find the right words, several feet away from us a child suddenly shrieked at her mother who was trying to coax her into the pool, drawing all of our attention. \n\nThe bony woman in a flower print dress waited until her child stopped screaming, then fell to her knees, clenched her fists, and started hitting herself in the face, one fist after the other, deliberate and robotic, like a windup toy. \n\nI stood there, stunned, as the woman continued to pummel herself. Through the pain, she held a vacant gaze I immediately recognized. Within that look, I saw myself. All the moments when it felt as if I'd been ejected from my body while something else took hold.\n\nComing to my senses, I ran over to her, along with Dave and a few other parents. By the time we all got there, the woman‚Äôs face was already a bloody mess. I held her arms back while Dave tried to help bring her back to consciousness. \n\n‚ÄúStop - stop hurting yourself!‚Äù \n\n‚Äú...My baby doesn‚Äôt want to swim,‚Äù the woman managed to say at last, several teeth tumbling out of her mouth as her body went limp in my arms.\n\nI noticed then that the backyard was oddly quiet. I looked up and realized it was suddenly only me and Dave there with this bloody-faced woman. The other parents had wandered off somewhere. \n\nA fleshy *smack* echoed nearby. I turned and there beside a bed of lilacs stood the woman I was just in conversation with. She was now standing over her husband who had removed his pants and was on all fours in the dirt. She pulled her arm back and smacked his bare ass  with that same absent look in her eyes, over and over again. \n\n‚ÄúWhat the actual fuck‚Ä¶‚Äù Dave rightly said. \n\nI was about to tell him we needed to leave immediately, when I noticed he wasn‚Äôt actually watching the public spanking. Instead his eyes were on something else confounding. \n\nOne of the other couples was standing off by the snack table, stuffing each other's faces with handfuls of vegetables. They forced the raw carrots and broccoli down, gagging from the effort. They seemed to be entirely unaware of their actions, like puppets on strings.\n\nAnd beside them, near a fountain, I found our hosts - the husband, who admitted to being a Crossfitter earlier, had his thick arms wrapped around his wife in a hug, squeezing her so tightly I could hear the bones of her ribcage snapping one by one. \n\nI couldn‚Äôt move. Couldn‚Äôt breathe. I felt a familiar tingling sensation against my back. \n\nBehind me, the children were standing in the sandbox, staring at us with impassive faces. Harper‚Äôs eyes were set on mine. They seemed to glow. \n\nThe sensation against my back spread through my body. I could feel the icy tendrils worm their way into my brain. Digging deeper, in search of control. \n\nMy head suddenly spun toward Dave on its own. \n\nI stared at him blankly, as a voice from deep within commanded me to - \n\n‚Äú*EAT YOUR DINNER.‚Äù* \n\nThe last thing I remember is my eyes being directed toward a carving knife on the snack table behind Dave, and feeling compelled to use it to carve my husband into ribbons of flesh that I would then slurp up like spaghetti noodles. \n\n‚ÄúElle‚Ä¶‚Äù David said, noticing me. ‚ÄúWhy the hell are you smiling like that?‚Äù \n\nI couldn‚Äôt respond. A fog had flushed my senses. My body was no longer mine.  \n\nHours later, a woman in a black pantsuit shook me awake. \n\n‚ÄúMrs. Parker?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAre you here with me?‚Äù  \n\nIt took a minute to orient myself. My hands were restrained in chicken wire. There was blood on my dress. The backyard was teeming with police and paramedics. Some of the parents were being treated for wounds, others wheeled away on gurneys. Dave among them, alive, *thank god*, receiving bandages for several knife wounds - his face pale, aghast. \n\nI would later learn from him that while I was under the control of our daughter, I had picked up a serving knife and tried to plunge it into his chest. He fended me off but we were both cut up badly in the process. \n\n‚ÄúI'm a contractor with The Nova Institute,‚Äù the woman said, her eyes hidden behind reflective aviators. ‚ÄúI have some questions for you about Harper.‚Äù \n\n‚Äú...Where is she?‚Äù I asked, trying unsuccessfully to stand, my feet also bound in wire. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my baby?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I want to talk to you about. We recovered the other children, but Harper wasn‚Äôt among them. Now I need you to be very honest with me, Mrs Parker, because this situation is not good for either of us‚Ä¶ Do you know where we can find your daughter?‚Äù \n\nI glanced over at Dave just as he turned my direction. We traded a brief look and in that look I knew that Harper was now in possession of him. She was somewhere nearby, using him to avoid detection. \n\n‚ÄúI have no idea,‚Äù I told the woman. ‚ÄúBut my daughter had nothing to do with this.‚Äù \n\nThe woman sighed. She rose to her feet, and looked down at me. \n\n‚ÄúI hate to break it to you, ma'am, but your fucking kid is not all right‚Ä¶‚Äù \n\nShe wandered off to speak to Dave as a paramedic swooped in to help me out of my restraints. I watched as Harper used Dave to explain that he had seen her leave through a side gate, so she would be far away by now. \n\nMy heart swelled. Our sweet baby girl realized she did need us after all. \n\nHarper‚Äôs in our care now. We‚Äôve moved several times since these events, so it won‚Äôt be possible to find us. We have our differences, like any family, but we‚Äôre working through them. Most importantly, we know what our daughter is, and what she‚Äôs not. \n\nOne day, when we release our baby to the world, I hope you are just as accepting as we have been. Otherwise, well, she does have a way of commanding a room.",

Putting a name to it was funny. Werewolf, vampire, the terms conjured goofy Halloween costumes, embarrassing to even say out loud. And yet here was one of them before me, helping me search for the other.\n\n‚ÄúCan you smell that awful stench?‚Äù  He asked, wrinkling his face in disgust.\n\n‚ÄúNope. Not at all.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGood,‚Äù he coughed, putting his hand over his nose. ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm on the right track.‚Äù\n\nHe meandered around, following the scent around the property, muttering to himself about the uncouth hygiene habits of the *loup garou*. I followed him to the best of my abilities, but he clearly wasn‚Äôt expecting me to be able to keep up. Finally, the trail ended at the bank of the river, almost a quarter mile down from my dock. \n\n‚ÄúThere.‚Äù He pointed to a small, heavily forested island across from us in the river.\n\n‚ÄúHow did he get over here? Don‚Äôt tell me the werewolf has a boat.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI have no idea.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWell, however he got over here, I‚Äôll have him pay you directly for the repairs to the damage he caused on my property.‚Äù\n\nHe chuckled. \n\n‚ÄúYou have a grudge against this creature, eh?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHe was particularly vindicative towards Martina. Total asshole.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThey all are, trust me.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAm I detecting some sort of vampire snobbery?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo! Well, perhaps a little. But I assure you the primary source of my distaste comes from the fact that our mutual enemy is far too fond of them. She always has to have one by her side, and when they grow too old, she discards them for a new one. So, the lycanthropic pest prowling your cottages is only the latest in a long line of lapdogs.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf the werewolf is the witch‚Äôs pet, why would he want to speak with us?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI do not know. I hope he can be persuaded. Even assholes can chafe on the leash of their masters.‚Äù\n\nWe stood together staring at the dark island. There was no sign of habitation that was visible to my eyes. I made a mental note to consult some of my uncle‚Äôs old nautical charts in my cottage to see if this place even had a name. Luckily, according to the notebook, I had some days before the next payment was due. Good timing for a field trip.\n\n‚ÄúThe night grows late and we are going to need all of our strength,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMeet me tomorrow at the docks, and bring your pretty silver bracelets.‚Äù He smirked, clearly remembering my awkward maneuver with the bangles the first night we met. \n\n‚ÄúI know, I know.  It was awkward.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI found it rather charming.‚Äù\n\nI blushed.\n\n‚ÄúOkay, stop flirting. What time are we meeting tomorrow?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúTwo hours after sunset?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDo I want to know what you‚Äôll be doing from the time you awake until you‚Äôre meeting me?‚Äù\n\nHe frowned.\n\n‚ÄúNo.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll pretend it‚Äôs not murder.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGood.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhere are you staying anyway? The cemetery? A friendly hole in the ground?‚Äù\n\nHe rolled his eyes.\n\n‚ÄúNot if I can help it. I‚Äôve actually had quite the grand stroke of luck. My old place was actually up for rent.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou mean the place you lived in *one hundred years ago*?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes. It only took a bit of persuasion to get the landlord to agree to a highly discounted rent.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPlease, don‚Äôt you dare say‚Äî‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúRelax. Just a bit of mental fog, the power of suggestion. No harm.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou know if that falls through, you‚Äôre welcome to a non-cursed cottage.‚Äù\n\nHe smiled.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre very kind. Goodnight, Nora.‚Äù\n\nHe took my hand in both of his and squeezed it. As he turned to leave, I stopped him with a hand on his shoulder.\n\n‚ÄúRen√©, you told me some things today that I‚Äôm sure were deeply painful for you. And I also realize that you don‚Äôt need to be here. You could be in Bora Bora by now, enjoying that eternal youth. So, thank you.‚Äù\n\nHe held my gaze for a moment and nodded.\n\n‚ÄúWhatever we will do, we will figure it out together.‚Äù\n\n\\++\n\nThe following evening, I waited for Ren√© at my dock, silver bracelets on my wrists. In my pocket, I had carefully torn out the relevant page of the nautical chart from my uncle‚Äôs library. It was a bit yellowed‚Äîlike everything around here‚Äîbut it was sufficiently detailed for our purposes. Our destination was hardly more than a speck, labeled ‚ÄúGlendon Island‚Äù in tiny, almost microscopic print. \n\nI‚Äôve never driven a boat before, despite spending nearly every summer of my life on them. My dad or Uncle Jimmy were always the pilots. I tried to remember only the good times, the times when we‚Äôd sail out to a hidden island and swim all day, eating sandwiches in wet bathing suits in the sunshine that always somehow tasted better than at home. I didn‚Äôt want to think about their accident, how those memories were poisoned so soon. I tried to push down the dread that rose unbidden within me when I thought of stepping foot in a boat.\n\nI was grateful to see Ren√© walking up the gravel pathway that led from the motel parking lot to the dock. He looked exceedingly‚Ä¶vibrant.  A wave of dismay passed through me when I noticed he was wearing a different parka, this one a much plainer black and gray. He had an extra-large thermos with him. The whole thing was just so macabre and yet somehow also hilarious. I couldn‚Äôt help but begin to laugh.\n\nRen√© seemed mildly offended.\n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so funny?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNothing, nothing. What happened to the green jacket?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI thought it made you upset.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhere did you get the gray one, then?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat is equally disturbing!‚Äù\n\nHe shrugged.\n\n‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù\n\nI closed my eyes and sighed. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just get on with it, shall we? I have the silver.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAs do I.‚Äù He pulled out a thin silver chain from his pocket. I nodded. He approached the boat left behind by the man who had the misfortune of arriving at my motel on the night our taxes were due. ‚ÄúCan we use this boat?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI guess. I don‚Äôt think the owner is coming back for it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSeems like it is in fine working condition.‚Äù He hopped in and retrieved a pair of paddles. ‚ÄúI do not think it is wise to use the motor. Too much ice and besides it‚Äôs far too noisy.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAre we concerned about noise?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe should probably not announce our arrival with much advance fanfare.‚Äù He raised his hand to me to help me down. I hesitated, heart leaping, remembering the phone call from the police telling me my dad wouldn‚Äôt be coming home. *Freak boating accident.* I shook away the memories and took a deep breath of bracing cold air. I took Ren√©‚Äôs hand and stepped inside, steadying myself against the slight lurch as I sat.\n\n‚ÄúAre you alright, Nora?‚Äù\n\nI shuddered and nodded.\n\n‚ÄúFine, thanks.‚Äù\n\nHe sat, grabbed a paddle, and tossed me one.\n\n‚ÄúI can handle it myself, if you don‚Äôt feel up to paddling. This boat is not much larger than the canoes I used as a child.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThanks, but I can pull my weight.‚Äù\n\nWe began to paddle carefully, but with steady speed. Ren√© was able to pilot and steer with ease, even in the dark, icy conditions. A perk of heightened senses, I suppose. His obvious happiness at being on the river was infectious and I found my initial anxiety melting away, the rhythm of my breathing returning to normal. \n\n‚ÄúWhat else do you know about werewolves?‚Äù I asked, voice barely above a whisper.\n\n‚ÄúNot much to know. Full moon, silver, pervasive stench‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúCan they change into wolf form at will, or only during a full moon? Probably something good to know given the purpose of this excursion.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDuring the full moon they must transform, willing or no. Those in the service of the witch would also transform at her will, and she could force the transformation if she sensed any hesitation. This was something I witnessed on multiple occasions and it was never pleasant. Poor beasts. Left to their own devices, I believe the werewolves could transform to defend themselves when threatened. All the more we must approach with caution.‚Äù\n\nI nodded. I glanced at the black depths below us. The cadence of my paddle hitting the water was almost pleasant. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught a pale form dart deeper and out of sight. With a chill, I remembered The Wet Lady slithering into the water, marble eyes glowing lifelessly in the depths. Would she be the one to bring me death this year, completing the task she had begun when I was a child?\n\n‚ÄúRen√©? What is it like to die?‚Äù\n\nHe frowned. \n\n‚ÄúI can‚Äôt rightly say. I‚Äôve never experienced a true death, the sundering of the body and the soul. Please, Nora, don‚Äôt think of it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat would cause you to truly die? Can you die?‚Äù\n\nHe grinned.\n\n‚ÄúAre you contemplating another attempt on my life? Because I promise, the gun is useless.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúStakes to the heart?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSunlight and fire. See? Now you know my secret. I‚Äôve armed you with the knowledge of my destruction.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôll store it away for future reference.‚Äù\n\nThe island loomed before us, wreathed in a mist that had not been visible from my dock. Jagged rocks sloped down to meet the river. As far as I could see there were thick growths of trees and bushes. We became silent, aware of every movement, our paddling slowed and Ren√© expertly guided our boat to an outcropping. He secured our rope around a large boulder and hopped out without a sound. He added some knots and reached out for me. Upon taking his hand he lifted me out of the boat entirely in one swift motion. *I suppose that was much quieter than my attempts at fumbling my way out.* \n\nRen√© contorted his face in disgust and nodded, indicating to me that we were in the right place for a werewolf. We began to explore, careful to avoid stepping on twigs or slipping on any patches of ice. When my eyes adjusted to the darkness of my surroundings, I noticed that among the natural debris of vegetation there was trash, piece of litter that on closer inspection appeared to be cigarette butts and flattened cartons. I tried to stifle the hot anger rising in my face. *Asshole and a slob.* I shook the bangles into the palms of my hands and gripped them tightly.\n\nThe island was much larger than I thought by looking at my uncle‚Äôs map. After making our way through the trees for what seemed like hours, we came across a clearing pockmarked by tree stumps. In the center was a twisted figure that at first glance appeared alive, but as we crept closer it revealed itself to be a towering structure made entirely of bones, piles and piles of bones. *Hopefully from animals*, I thought uneasily. The thing was crowned by the skull of what must have been a massive buck with enormous antlers draped with what appeared to be dry marine algae. \n\nThe thing was horrifying, but despite my churning stomach I felt compelled to take a few steps forward, to reach out my hands to touch it. I imagined my fingers caressing the smooth bones, cold and solid, so nice to grasp. I could lay down in the soft grass before it, under its watchful gaze. Yes, it watched, it would love to watch me, it would love to know me. Ren√© clamped his hands on my shoulders and I struggled against his powerful grip.  He turned me to face him, and lifted my face to his eyes.\n\n*Nora, you must stop.* His voice was in my head without moving his lips. *This thing no longer has any power over you.* I shook my head, dazed. Whatever spell that had momentarily held me was broken. I gazed at him in wonder, but he placed his finger over his lips and shook his head. Still holding me, he backed us away from the clearing and the figure within.\n\nAt a safe distance he released me.  Still a little dizzy, I steadied myself against a tree. I pulled out a notepad and pencil that I remembered I had in my interior coat pocket.\n\n‚ÄúWTF,‚Äù I wrote, handing it to Ren√©.\n\n‚ÄúA spy,‚Äù he wrote underneath.\n\n‚ÄúHers?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat was with your voice in my head?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúVampire persuasive technics, remember? Only for emergencies.‚Äù He underlined ‚Äúemergencies.‚Äù\n\nI nodded.\n\nHe continued to write at a frenetic pace and then handed the pad back to me.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to like this, but I think we‚Äôd have better luck splitting up. Continue to walk around the forest, but avoid the clearing. Do not be too worried about making noise, walk as you normally would. You will not see me, but I will be there. And I promise, on my life, that nothing will happen to you. Keep your bangles close.‚Äù\n\nI shook my head. He added two more words.\n\n‚ÄúTrust me.‚Äù\n\nDid I trust him? Did it matter? He was probably right. The werewolf would be more likely to approach, or at least allow himself to be spotted if I were alone. \n\nI bit my lip and nodded. He gave me a reassuring smile and quicker than I could react he had darted away, disappearing into the trees. *Toughen up*, I told myself, repeating Martina‚Äôs words. \n\nHeartened, I began to explore on my own, not too focused on avoiding sticks and paper and other things that crunched under my boots. I moved in the opposite direction from the clearing, towards the side of the island we had not visited before. After what felt like ages, the trees yielded to smaller shrubberies and I found myself staring at a lopsided log cabin, constructed in a very amateurish fashion. \n\n*I guess this is where the guy lives*. Part of me wanted to simply go knock on the door, but I decided to go around the back instead. As I approached, I suddenly sensed something behind me, the feeling of eyes on the back of my head. *Must be* *Ren√©*, I thought, engaging in a bit of wishful thinking.\n\nI turned around. Behind me was the beast, the size of a grown man, its gangly limbs pressed down to the ground, as though ready to pounce. It glared at me with frenzied yellowed eyes and sharp teeth, the face was not as sleek as that of a wolf, but rather misshapen for an animal, the snout was longer, the teeth more jagged and haphazard. \n\n*If I run, I am dead*. I took a step backwards, raising my hands clutching the silver to a position in front of me.\n\nThe werewolf snarled at the glint of silver, almost emboldened. A low, guttural growl emanated from its gaunt belly. Just as it tensed its back haunches for an attack, a white flash collided with it from seemingly out of nowhere. Ren√© tackled it to the ground, and buried his fangs into the beast‚Äôs neck, causing it to howl in pain and anger. It slashed his face, and the shock of the laceration momentarily shocked him enough for him to release the wolf, who was free to attack him with its full force. It pinned him to the ground.\n\nRen√© struck at the wolf‚Äôs face and bit down on its shoulder and the two struggled against each other, fighting ferociously. With a powerful kick, Ren√© finally flung the werewolf backwards, retrieved the silver chain from his pocket and wrapped it around the wolf‚Äôs neck with a hideous hiss.\n\n‚ÄúRen√©! Take these!‚Äù  I shouted, throwing him the bangles. He caught them with ease and pressed them into the flesh of its chest. The werewolf howled in agony, the animal sound rising into an ear-shattering crescendo before ceding to the screams of a human man. The claws had retracted into human hands.  \n\nI raced over to find that the beast was gone and in its stead was man in his mid-forties, with dark hair heavily streaked with gray. He was naked and writhing in agony under the silver, which clearly burned his flesh. The wounds that Ren√© had inflicted were raw and bleeding, though Ren√© had clearly avoided any major arteries. \n\nI turned to Ren√© who still glared at the man, fangs bared, panting. The lacerations inflicted by the werewolf had healed, but he was covered in blood from head to toe, newly acquired parka almost entirely shredded. I bent over to remove the silver, but his hand shot out to block me.\n\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs no good to us dead,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs what he‚Äôll be soon, by the looks of it, if we don‚Äôt remove the silver.‚Äù\n\nRen√©‚Äôs predatory expression didn‚Äôt change, he continued to stare at the man‚Äôs bloodied wounds. \n\n‚ÄúRen√©!‚Äù I slapped him across the face, surprising both of us with my strength. He blinked and shook his head.\n\n‚ÄúRight. Sorry. I‚Äôll take it off. Careful, he‚Äôs a tough bastard.‚Äù\n\nHe pushed me back but I didn‚Äôt move.\n\n‚ÄúWait, I just have to do something quick.‚Äù\n\nBefore he could stop me, I aimed the hardest kick I could muster into the werewolf‚Äôs stomach.  The man‚Äôs moan was so pathetic, I almost felt bad about it. *Almost.* Ren√© grinned.\n\n‚ÄúMay I?‚Äù \n\nI nodded. He bent over and carefully removed the silver, taking some skin with it. The man cried out, promptly turning over and vomiting. \n\n‚ÄúCan you do something to stop the bleeding?‚Äù I asked. Ren√© narrowed his eyes.\n\n‚ÄúWith what?‚Äù He asked sullenly.\n\nI crossed my arms and frowned.\n\n‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù\n\nHe made a sound of annoyance. He bit his wrist and suspended it over the man‚Äôs neck wound, allowing several drops to fall. The blood did its work and began to knit together the ragged wound until the werewolf was left with nothing but a crater of dried blood. Ren√© did the same over the man‚Äôs shoulder and when that too was healed he turned to me.\n\n‚ÄúSatisfied?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe silver wounds?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHe can live with those.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAgreed.‚Äù\n\nThe man grunted and attempted to sit up.\n\n‚ÄúNo sudden movements, wolf, or I‚Äôll put you back on your leash,‚Äù Ren√© said, brandishing the silver chain.\n\n‚ÄúRelax, jackass, I‚Äôm too weak to shift,‚Äù the man croaked in a voice that sounded like it didn‚Äôt get much use. He was pale with blood loss, but otherwise seemed to be in good physical condition. His eyes appeared sad and haunted, dark circles underneath, a stark contrast to the fierce yellow stare of the beast he had been only moments before. He gestured to the ramshackle cabin. \n\n‚ÄúYou mind if I put some clothes on?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôll forgive us if we insist on escorting you.‚Äù\n\nHe grunted a reluctant assent and struggled to his feet. He was perhaps an inch or so shorter than Ren√©. His body was laced by a web of thick scars from his back to his chest and on his limbs. He limped his way into the cabin with me and Ren√© following behind.\n\nThe place smelled of hearth and cigarette smoke, fire that was no more than embers burned under a poorly constructed chimney that look like it was threatening to give at any moment. An ancient looking metal bed frame bore a worn mattress with a few filthy flannel blankets. Some random pieces of furniture dotted the rest of the cabin:  a dented metal countertop perhaps salvaged from a restaurant, a pair of Adirondack chairs with flaking red paint, and a card table that teetered on uneven legs. A shabby rattan rug covered the dirt floor.\n\nThe man quickly threw on a pair of jeans at the foot of the bed and a sweatshirt. Like Ren√©, he didn‚Äôt seem to be that bothered by the cold. He pointed to the chairs with a gruff motion of his chin. I sat. Ren√© frowned, but joined me.\n\n‚ÄúThis place is appalling,‚Äù he said.\n\nThe werewolf shrugged. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what I got.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI think we may have gotten off on the wrong foot,‚Äù I began. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not here to hurt you or kill you. I know we‚Äôre trespassing, but we just wanted to talk with you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNora is being awfully nice,‚Äù Ren√© said menacingly. ‚ÄúI suggest you talk to her unless you‚Äôd like me to get involved again.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNora?‚Äù The man said, ignoring Ren√©, a look of recognition passing over his face.\n\n‚ÄúYes. My name is Nora Calnon. You know, the one whose property you seem to enjoy destroying? Although looking around me, I don‚Äôt suppose you appear in any position to foot the bill for that. By the way, I suppose I told a bit of a fib just now. That kick in the stomach I gave you? I definitely came here to do that. That was for a friend of mine you tortured for years. Her name was Martina.‚Äù\n\nAt the sound of Martina‚Äôs name, the man blanched. He stood and began to pace.\n\n‚ÄúMartina,‚Äù he repeated.\n\n‚ÄúYou killed a friend of hers.‚Äù \n\nThe werewolf stopped pacing and shook his head. He approached me in wonder and touched my auburn hair, haunted eyes wide and glistening. I felt Ren√© immediately behind me at my shoulder. \n\n‚ÄúI remember you,‚Äù he whispered in a reverent hush. ‚ÄúNora Calnon. Nora Calnon, I promise you I would never do anything to hurt Martina.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I asked, already beginning to suspect the answer.\n\n‚ÄúMy name? I don‚Äôt have a name anymore.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat was your name? From before.‚Äù\n\nTears sprang to the man‚Äôs eyes.\n\n‚ÄúMy name?‚Äù He repeated. ‚ÄúMy name is Jake Hubert.‚Äù\n\n[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wine_Dark_Sea_1239/)",

        "text": "I signed up as a DoorDash driver about eight months ago. Not much income, even compared to my crappy day job, but it helps pay child support and keeps the pantry stocked with Sprite and Cheez-its for when my son Andy stays with me on the weekends.\n\nI never thought there was anything special about Maple Green Road until about a week ago‚Äîat least, I think it was a week ago. It's been hard to keep track. Before this DoorDash order, I thought the street was nothing but your standard, outdated, 90s neighborhood, featuring houses with overgrown shrubs and trees decorated with tire swings and faded birdhouses. But the house belonging to \"The Johnsons\", according to their DoorDash account, felt wrong as soon as I drove up.\n\nIt was just a red-brick, two-story, cookie-cutter build like the rest of the street, with a lawn that needed to be mowed. But somehow, I didn't think I'd noticed this particular house before. Something about the architecture made the front windows look like a row of watching eyes, the porch‚Äîjust a couple of steps leading up to a stoop‚Äîlike a snarl.\n\nLooking back now, I should have driven away. But the delivery instructions had mentioned there would be a twenty-dollar tip, which was astronomical as far as DoorDash goes. I put my car in park by the curb, took my phone off its dashboard mount, and grabbed the oversized paper bag of Wendy's food from my passenger seat. As I stepped up onto the sidewalk, I hit the \"I've arrived at customer\" button on my Dasher app. \n\nI set foot on the path leading to their front door, blinked, and found myself no longer on the path. Instead, I stood on the other side of the road. And I mean *all the way* across the road‚ÄîI saw my car, flashers on, parked in front of the red-brick home, and I was ten yards away from it. I'd like to think that I'm a pretty level-headed guy, who isn't prone to exaggeration, but the feeling of *wrongness* intensified. On the peak of the roof, a weather vane shaped like a raven started to spin, flashing in the early evening sunlight. \n\nI didn't feel any wind that could've moved it.\n\nSomehow, even then, I thought I must have imagined it. I thought I must have gotten turned around getting out of the car. I shrugged off the weird feeling‚Äîit had been a long day at work. That was definitely it, I told myself, I must have gotten distracted and went the wrong way. \n\nComforted, stupidly, by my own rationalization, I walked back across the street and up the path. When I was halfway across the yard, a kid's face emerged in a window on the right side of the house.\n\nIt was a teenage boy wearing a baseball cap. I could see his face fairly clearly for how dark it was inside the house. He was looking at my car, his eyes narrowed in what seemed to be confusion, but when he saw me coming up over the curb again his expression gave way to excitement. Or maybe it was relief? He must've been pretty hungry.\n\nHe waved in greeting, but before I could wave back, he looked over his shoulder and stepped away from the window.\n\nI stepped up onto the porch, frowning, and my phone buzzed in my hand. A DoorDash notification popped up on the screen.\n\n*The Johnsons: The door is unlocked. Leave the food on the table. Thanks!*\n\nI looked up at the front door. It had a window in the center, granting me a view into the house. Straight ahead, I could see a dining room with a large table at its center, framed by another large window at the back of the house. All the lights inside were off.\n\nThe weird feeling I'd tried to push away came rushing back‚Äîeverything about this situation seemed very wrong. Huge tip or not, there was no chance I was going inside that house. I set the food down and opened my Dasher app.\n\n*Sorry*, I typed, *DoorDash policy says I can't go inside a private home to deliver orders. You'll have to grab it from the porch.*\n\nI wasn't even sure if that was true, but I didn't wait for a reply. I turned away from the door and headed down the steps, tapping the \"Complete Delivery\" button as I went. I was distracted enough that I walked right into something.\n\nThe door. I walked into the front door of the house. I had been heading towards my car one moment, and the next I my forehead bumped against that glass window set in the front door.\n\nMy throat felt tight as I stepped back. The house seemed to crouch over me, the stoop suddenly claustrophobic like the mouth of a cave.  \n\nMy phone lit up with another message.\n\n*We can't open the door from inside. Put the food on the table. Leave the door open when you come in.*\n\nI didn't bother to reply. I turned away again, refusing to stay here any longer. My foot almost reached the first stair, but landed on the stoop instead, the door only inches from my face once again.\n\n\"What is this,\" I breathed, my heart pounding so hard I could feel my veins pulsing in my neck.\n\nFour more messages came in then, one right after the next in a staccato series of buzzes. \n\n*you can't leave unless you put it on the table*\n\n*now that you're here it won't let you leave*\n\n*PLEASE*\n\n*please leave the door open*\n\nMy insides turned to ice as I read. \"It\" wouldn't let me leave? What the hell was \"it\"? I had no idea what was going on here, and all I wanted was to get away from this house. I looked over my shoulder at my car, the flashers still blinking where I'd left it, and somehow  knew I wouldn't be able to reach it, not unless I followed the instructions and left the stupid food on the table. \n\nI wish I'd tried anyway. Even if I was stuck in an endless loop of trying to get to my car, it still would've been better than sealing my fate by setting foot inside the house. \n\nNo point wishing for that now, though.\n\nI picked up the Wendy's bag from the porch, turned the doorknob, and stepped inside.\n\nThe house was quiet and dim, the only light coming from the windows shaded by trees outside. I found myself in a central hall that stretched forward to the dining room table. There wasn't much other furniture to be seen, just a grandfather clock that looked like it was manufactured in the 80s. The table didn't even have chairs. Over my head, a two-story alcove housed a simple chandelier, its metal frame glinting in the sunlight from a window near the high ceiling.\n\nI was scared. Looking back, I know that I was right to be scared, but I was still nowhere near as scared as I should've been. Was this some kind of haunting? Some kind of delayed acid trip? I had no explanation for my situation, despite my racing thoughts. \n\nWhatever it was, I just needed to put the damn Wendy's bag on the table. \n\nI left the door half-open and made my way deeper into the house, my sneakers squeaking on the tile floor. The table was framed by that window at the back of the dining room, making it seem like it was highlighted in a video game‚Äî*Here's your objective, reach it and move on!*\n\nThe entryway seemed to be stretching longer as I walked. Surely the people who'd been sending messages were around here somewhere‚Äîthe window where I'd seen the teenage boy had been on the right side of the house‚Äîbut for now everything was silent. Halfway to the dining room, another darker hall led off to my right. It seemed like it might lead to bedrooms or offices, but I couldn't see anything more than smooth walls and shadows. I couldn't even make out doors. \n\nI had almost reached the table when a scent caught my attention. I hadn't noticed it when I first came in, but it was a little sweet, a little metallic, and a lot like‚Äî \n\nSomething wet dripped against my leg. It slid from below the hem of my shorts, along my calf. In the dim light, the wet streak on my leg was a red so dark it almost looked black.\n\nIt was coming from the Wendy's bag. Blood, sticky and wet, and soaking the bottom of the paper bag. I knew there was normal food in there, I'd smelled it during the entire drive from Wendy's. The stuff dripping was probably a busted ketchup packet, or some burger grease, or‚Äî\n\nDeep in the house, a door closed.\n\nMy breath hitched in my throat. I ran the rest of the way to the table and tossed the bag onto it. It puddled onto the cherry wood surface, the bottom thoroughly soaked.\n\nThe light coming through the big dining room window was getting darker. I could‚Äîwere those stars in the sky outside? Hadn't it only been five-thirty? It was July, it shouldn't have been getting dark yet. \n\nIt didn't matter. I was leaving. I stepped back from the table, but couldn't pull my eyes away from the paper bag. The blood had spread, masking Wendy's grinning face in a film of red.\n\nFor the last time, my phone buzzed with a burst of messages.\n\n*leave*\n\n*run right now*\n\n*and leave the door open*\n\n*LEAVE*\n\nI shoved my phone in my pocket and ran. The front door was still half-open, giving me a clear path to my car where it sat, flashing its blinkers by the curb.\n\nThe paper bag crunched on the table a dozen steps behind me, and at the same time something else darted out from the hallway to my left.\n\nI yelped, but it was the kid I'd seen in the window, wearing his baseball cap. He grabbed my hand and pulled me towards the half-open door.\n\n\"Run!\" he said, his voice hoarse, as if he hadn't used it in months. \"While it eats the food! We have to go before‚Äî\"\n\nSomething plopped onto the floor in front of us.\n\nThe Wendy's bag. Torn, soaked with blood.\n\nThe kid ground to a halt and I nearly barreled over him in my attempt to stop. He was looking up. I followed his gaze.\n\nIn the dim light of the alcove above, where the window was now darkened and the chandelier barely visible, *something* was looking down at us. Something with a confusing mix of shapes‚Äîslick curves like the frames of chairs forming ribs, the bloated swell of overstuffed couch cushions forming lumpy sides, the glinting points of a dozen kitchen knives and silver forks forming jagged teeth. And bones. Human bones, sticking out at odd angles.\n\nThe kid had time to make a brief, strangled groan. That was it, and then the thing overhead moved in a flick of motion. A tendril made of twisted bedsheets snapped towards us and hooked the kid around the throat. He screamed as it yanked him up, and as I stumbled back, knives thunked into flesh. His screams stopped. \n\nThe entire house creaked. Somehow, it sounded pleased.\n\nThe thing began squelching and crunching over my head. \n\nEating.\n\nI darted for the door, but as I reached for the handle to pull it the rest of the way open, it slammed itself shut. The grandfather clock on the wall clanged once, somewhere deeper in the house I heard doors opening and slamming shut.\n\nThe house was laughing at me.\n\nI grabbed the handle and tried to turn, but it wouldn't budge. It wasn't even locked, I could see that the deadbolt was open, but the handle was just fixed in place. I was trapped.\n\nOverhead, the creature made a sound like chairs scraping across the floor. I made the mistake of looking up at it‚Äîthe thing's legs uncurled from the chandelier, made of wire hangers that seemed too flimsy to support its bulk. It stabbed its feet into the drywall and lunged towards me.\n\nI dove. Sheets brushed against the back of my calves, warm and wet and sticky. I scrambled into the dark hallway, and sprinted as fast as my legs would carry me.\n\nThe hallway seemed to stretch for dozens of yards, more distance than should've fit into the home that I'd seen from outside. My lungs burned, my breath rasping through my throat, but I ran until I crashed headlong into a door.\n\nI breathed a prayer of thanks as it opened, then slammed the door shut behind me. I looked around for furniture I could shove against it, but I was in a small bathroom, and nothing was here except the toilet and vanity anchored to the wall. In the space next to the toilet, a window looked out to a darkened street. I could see my car parked by the curb. Its flashers would keep going until its battery died, and it would sit there until some neighbor called a tow truck and had it pulled away. \n\nI think it's been a week since I got here. I'm not sure why that creature can't seem to reach me in this bathroom, but I've hardly attempted to leave‚Äîthe bathroom window won't open or break, and the only time I managed to reach the front door, the knob still didn't budge. I barely made it back to the bathroom alive, so I'm just hoping this post will make it out and catch someone's attention. My phone doesn't seem to be working right, and no one who's walked by the house has even seemed to notice that it's here. I think that's why they towed my car.\n\nMy phone is nearly dead, but if you see this post, the address is ¬°ÃõÃ®ÃµÃ°Ã®¬∂ÃõÃ∑ÃïÃ®0Ã¥Õò¬ßÃïÃ∏&amp;ÕÄÃ∑ÕÄ ÕÅÕ°Õ†Õ°ÕùMÕüÕ°Ã∑Ã®√•Ã∑ÕûÕ†œÄÃïÃßÃ∏Ã®lÃ∏Ã¢Ãß¬¥ÃßÕùÃßÃµ¬©Õ†Õû¬ÆÃ∂Õ¢Ã®eÕèÕúÕÄÕèe“ânÕùÃß ÕòÃïÕÅ‚Ä∞ÃµÕÄÕÅÕÅdÕûÕÅÃ°ÃïÃï,ÕùÃ¥Ã¢ Ã∑ÕûÃ∑√ÖÕ°ÕèsÕúÃ∂hÕùÃ°Ã¥ÕûÃ∂‚àöÃ¢Ã¥i“âÕúÃ¢ÕÄ¬¨Õ†Ã∏ÕÄÕ†Õú¬¥Ã¢Õ°Õ†ÃõÀúÃ∂Ã∑Ã∂CÃïÕÅÕ°Ã®Õ°,Õ°Ã∂Ã¢Ã∏ Õ°Ãï5ÃõÃ®¬∂ÃßÕûÕèÃï5Õ¢ÕúÃ¥5Õ†Õ¢“â√∏ÕüÕÅÃ°ÕÅ.

        "text": "**Day 1**\n\nSo it looks like Caitlin‚Äôs dad was right‚ÄîI *won‚Äôt* live to see 40. I suppose you‚Äôve gotta give credit where it‚Äôs due.\n\nAlthough, in fairness, that prick thought I‚Äôd wind up flatlining under a bridge with a needle sticking out of my ass, not stranded on a desert island.\n\nAnyway, my names George, and this is my diary. I always thought these things were a bit stupid and pointless (still do) but Catlin‚Äôs asleep and I‚Äôve run out of pebbles to skip across the water, so here‚Äôs the story so far‚Ä¶\n\nOnce the tide rolled in the boat drifted off and sank. Cat and I escaped by jumping overboard, but she landed badly on a rock, now her left ankle is an ugly purple bruise. She keeps insisting it doesn‚Äôt hurt all that much, but this is a woman who could look on the bright side of a black hole, so take that for what it‚Äôs worth.\n\nI salvaged some supplies from the wreckage, including a water bottle, the food we brought along (crackers, cheese, a pineapple, three bananas, some beef jerky), a knife, this little notebook, binoculars, and a flashlight. I also held onto Caitlin‚Äôs gift, although I can‚Äôt say more about that in case she reads this later (which if you are, Angelface, sorry for ruining your 31st birthday).\n\nEarlier, I joked about having the beach to ourselves, and how romantic the sunset looked. Caitlin half-laughed half-sobbed. I can tell she‚Äôs anxious the rescue mission might take a while since it‚Äôs unlikely anybody even realizes we‚Äôre missing yet. Call that karma for using her parent's summerhouse without permission.\n\nSo far, the weather‚Äôs great. Not too hot, not too cold. It‚Äôs the perfect time of year to get shipwrecked, I guess.\n\nAt low tide, red and orange crabs swarmed over the seaweed-covered rocks in the bay, but they scurried into the water whenever I got too close. The yappy seabirds are way too fast to catch as well. Still, if we‚Äôre careful we can stretch out our supplies to last a week or so. I think. I mean, I‚Äôm no Bear Grylls, but that‚Äôs how it looks.\n\nThe island doesn‚Äôt seem all that big, although it‚Äôs hard to tell because there‚Äôs trees and valleys everywhere. Tomorrow the plan is for me to head inland and see how ‚Äòalone‚Äô we really are. If I get lost, I‚Äôll walk until I hit the coast and follow it back here. It‚Äôs like keeping one hand against a maze wall. Best case scenario, there‚Äôs other people around‚Äîmaybe a lighthouse keeper or an eccentric billionaire who owns the place. If not, fingers crossed some passing fishermen spot Caitlin.\n\nAnyway, that‚Äôs all for now. Ciao.\n\n\\--\n\n**Day 2**\n\nOkay, so there‚Äôs some crappy news, some AMAZING news, and some seriously, seriously shitty news. First the crappy news‚Ä¶\n\nThe islands bigger than I thought. And theres bushes, ferns, and tall grass everywhere, which means it‚Äôs impossible to take more than twenty steps in a single direction.\n\nOut East, I found a rocky mound. It was eighty foot high and fairly steep but there were exposed roots and boulders I could use for grip, which meant I reached the summit before dusk.\n\nThat leads us onto the amazing news‚Ä¶\n\nUp there, I looked around through the binoculars and spotted a shack and a rowboat on the southern side of the island, way in the distance. They‚Äôre on a narrow stretch of beach surrounded by a cove.\n\nThe problem is, navigating the islands gonna be tricky. To cross it we‚Äôll need to march through a dense forest with bald patches covered in bumpy hilltops. Solo, I could make the journey in a day. I think.\n\nWhen Cat heard the news, she jumped up then grimaced while holding her ankle. Because of the limited supplies, time is against us. She suggested I go solo then, if the shacks unoccupied, row the boat around to collect her (without slamming into a rock this time), although I‚Äôm against this suggestion for two reasons.\n\nNumber one: that would mean splitting the supplies. And we‚Äôve only got one water bottle.\n\nNumber two is the shitty news‚Ä¶\n\nThere‚Äôs three crucifixes planted beside the shack, spaced out in the sand. That feels like an excessive amount. What if some recluse started a cult out here where they could perform crazy ritual sacrifices? Hell, maybe those crosses mark the graves of previous castaways‚Ä¶\n\nPart of me thinks we might not *want* to meet this individual (or individuals). That said, the alternative is dying of a painful thirst and getting our eyeballs pecked out by gulls. I suppose it‚Äôs possible whoever built the place is long gone, although I doubt they‚Äôd have left their boat in that case.\n\nCat got me laughing a while back. My hands look like they‚Äôve gone through a paper shredder because of the climb, which set her off grumbling about infections. I pointed at her inflated ankle and said I‚Äôd be a real asshole if I cried about some measly cuts. She‚Äôs always been like that‚Äîmore concerned about others than herself.\n\nNow I think about it, she‚Äôs in a weirdly upbeat mood. Even for her. She keeps joking about how we might wanna stay lost rather than have her dad find out what happened. It‚Äôs better than her writhing around in agony, I guess.\n\nSince she looked drained, I let her rest her ankle on my lap while I massaged her shoulders. I‚Äôd be lying if I said part of me didn‚Äôt enjoy being *her* guardian angel for a change.\n\nAnyway, that‚Äôll do for now. Adios.\n\n\\--\n\n**Day 2 entry 2**\n\nAngelface found her gift while I was off exploring. That‚Äôs why she kept making jokes‚Äîshe knows her Dad‚Äôs gonna have a stroke when he finds out I sunk his precious boat AND proposed to his daughter in the same week.\n\nShe slipped the ring back into the bag, but she couldn‚Äôt have been more obvious if she grew a tail and started wagging it. She says the rings perfect, which came as a relief (I can picture her dad casually mentioning the one *he* bought *his* wife cost ¬£25,000).\n\nTo celebrate our engagement, I went and picked some pink wildflowers. Afterwards, we had beef jerky, followed by pineapple chunks. To cap the evening off, we lay down and held each other. The warmth of her body felt nice.\n\nThis is so typical me: I get engaged to the most beautiful woman on the planet days before deranged cultists carve out my intestines.\n\nI shouldn‚Äôt make those kinda jokes. Think positive, George.\n\nAu Revoir.\n\n\\--\n\n**Day 3**\n\nLast night Caitlin heard a twig snap from out in the forest. She grabbed the flashlight but anytime she pointed the beam we only saw branches shake and dip. Neither of us moved or said a single word, just listened to the hypnotic ocean waves. Then, right as my eyelids drooped shut, Cat shrieked.\n\nShe insisted a tiny pair of arms wrapped around a trunk like somebody was hugging it from behind. For the next few hours, every minor sound‚Äîeven just the whistling wind‚Äîmade her yelp and waste more battery power searching the spaces between trees.\n\nAt dawn, I suggested a boar maybe picked up the scent of jerky and came sniffing around, and soon Caitlin had a purple face to match her ankle. She accused me of calling her delusional (which I didn‚Äôt).\n\nSince our stomachs wouldn‚Äôt quit grumbling, we finished the leftover jerky and washed it down with some water. Unfortunately, my blistered hands couldn‚Äôt hold onto the stupid bottle, so a portion of our reserve leaked into the sand, which made Cat snap and say her dad was right about me.\n\nWe tested whether she could walk alone. She barely managed ten steps in the sand, which means the islands gonna be borderline impossible. Problem is, my strengths dipping every day, the supplies are dangerously low, and unless the (potential) cult leader is both real and friendly, I‚Äôll need to haul Cat through the forest AND THEN paddle us both to the mainland.\n\nOh, I almost forgot: she INSISTED we waste even MORE energy by relocating to the far side of the bay. There‚Äôs a ridge against our backs here. After I laid out our supplies on a flat patch of rock, Cat apologised for her earlier jab. We kissed and made up and agreed we‚Äôll set off tomorrow, no matter what. Fingers crossed a single banana and some cheese keeps me fuelled up.\n\nAll we can do now is wait‚Ä¶\n\n**--**\n\n**Day 4**\n\nIt came back. Sometime after dark Caitlin pointed out a glowing set of eyes moving between trees. They slipped out of view when I shouted whos there.\n\nWood snapped, then the moonlight shining through the branches blacked out as something swooped from left to right. Caitlin screamed. I pointed the beam but only saw leaves floating down.\n\nTo preserve the battery, I only used the flashlight whenever we heard or spotted movement. Each time I flicked the switch twigs snapped, or footsteps trampled through dead leaves. This went on and on. By dawn, it felt like I‚Äôd doused my eyes with salt water.\n\nMy parched throat still aches from the big blowout Caitlin and I had about how much of the last banana I was eating. She only shut up when I told her she could have more if she carried herself.\n\nOur remaining supplies got crammed inside the pack. Together, they weigh between 10 and 15 pounds, which feels like a lot when you haven‚Äôt had a proper meal in almost a week.\n\nEven though I only half-carried half-hugged her royal heinous, it felt like hauling a boulder around on my shoulders. At one point I mentioned this and she shoved me away, and since then, she‚Äôs only answered my questions with childish, one-word responses.\n\nFurther inland, the ground got bumpy. Those hills weren‚Äôt steep, but they never ended. The amount of time we wasted catching our breaths is ridiculous. Every bird taking off made us jump. Also, we tripped on EVERY fucking tree root then we‚Äôd waste time fighting. Again.\n\nWe pushed on until my leg muscles started spasming then stopped inside a ring of trees. There‚Äôs crisscrossed branches everywhere plus a gap in the canopy.\n\nI napped so I can keep watch all night. If that thing followed us here we‚Äôre fucked.\n\nDad, if you‚Äôre reading this: sorry for being such a shit before. I always meant to repay your love and kindness when I started doing better financially.\n\n(P.S. you were right. I **SHOULD** have stayed in school)\n\n\\--\n\n**Day 6 (I think)**\n\nWe‚Äôre fucked. Last night that thing slipped between trees and bushes. I grabbed the knife and went over and kicked one but nothing happened. I waited a while. Then Caitlin screamed. There was glowing eyes above her in the canopy. The thing dropped on her and bit her. It looked pale and thin and small like a child. I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was a boy or girl. Its clothes were old and its skin peeled when I grabbed its head. There‚Äôs still wet chunks under my fingernails. It‚Äôs smells horrible.\n\nThe creature was small but strong. My feet lifted in the air as I stabbed it in the face and neck. Its lip was all sideways. I got it in the chest before it threw me off. I thought I landed on a stick but the snap was my ribs. Breathing isn‚Äôt easy now. The thing hissed like a snake. It‚Äôs teeth looked like needles. Or a porcupine. It ran off on all fours with the knife sticking out. Caitlins thigh looks like minced beef. Black veins are showing through. I put bandages on and she said it burns and kept swatting my hand away and calling me a useless fuck.\n\nAfter a while she said sorry. I told her sorry for fucking up our lives. I told her her dad was right. She said no her dads a cunt. We both laughed. Then she spat out a tooth.\n\nI fucking love her so much. She needs a doctor. I didn‚Äôt tell her carrying her makes it hard to breathe now. I found a blood trail and the knife. It was in a patch of red flat grass. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs good. The thing looked like a child. What if its parents live at the shack? We might be fucked. I‚Äôm a murderer. I carried her south until my feet hurt. Now we‚Äôre resting. A few minutes ago she spat out another tooth. The boat can‚Äôt be much further. I want to sleep but can‚Äôt in case Caitlin gets bad so I‚Äôll write instead.\n\nShe keeps talking about how we met. I remember it well. She found me overdosing in an alley and shook me awake and said the ambulance was coming. I could only make out her pretty features and copper hair. I was so fucked up I thought I was dead. I kept asking if she was an angel and telling her she looked like one.\n\nShe STILL looks like one.\n\n\\--\n\n**Day ??**\n\nWe found the shack. No one lives here. There‚Äôs water. Also jarred fruits. I ate and drank but I‚Äôm afraid to sleep. Caitlin might die. Theres way more crucifixes but theyd all broken because the rope rotten so they‚Äôre bundles of sticks really. Caitlin is on the beach. She‚Äôs pale and sweaty and doesn‚Äôt want the heat. Wont come inside either. Thrashes around whenever I try. Also, she‚Äôs spitting teeth. Lots. Her lips are flaky. She keeps complaining about how thirsty she is. I give her water but she couldn‚Äôt keep it down. Second time she grabbed the ring off her finger and told me to stick it up my ass because its cheap and shit. Whoever built this place is gone. All I found were framed photos of a man in glasses and a girl. Maybe his daughter. She looks about seven maybe eight. And I killed her maybe. There was so much blood.\n\nSoon we‚Äôre casting off.\n\n\\--\n\nI fell asleep after the last entry. When I woke up Caitlin had vanished. A sand trail led me South. I found her in a cave in the shadows. She was standing around like she never hurt herself. Kept saying she felt fine. Except she looked pale and washed out and her lips were all cracked. I didn‚Äôt like it. I didn‚Äôt like how she kept asking me to come inside the cave. Her voice sounded different.\n\nI went forward slowly. When we were close she grinned. Now I could see her eyes. They looked silver. And glowy. The second I stopped she hissed. Her teeth were sharp. I ran back here to the shack. It‚Äôs getting dark so I can‚Äôt cast off. Too risky. This is so fucked. Why is she better? How?\n\n\\--\n\nCaitlin keeps knocking the door. Asking if she can come in. I‚Äôm too afraid to answer. She keeps pawing at the walls and saying she‚Äôs thirsty. And asking if I remember how we met.\n\n\\--\n\nCaitlin‚Äôs on the roof. I can hear footsteps. She wants me to let her in. Before she asked nice but now shes screaming. She says I deserve to die for getting us stranded. She said she helped me through my relapses and got me clean and she didn‚Äôt list to her dad saying to leave me and I‚Äôm a terrible selfish person and she‚Äôs right. I can‚Äôt stop crying. This is so fucked.\n\n\\--\n\nThose silver eyes are watching me from a gap between boards. Cat still wants me to go outside. She keeps talking about how much she loves me. Says if I love her I‚Äôll go outside. Now she‚Äôs crying because the thirst hurts. I love her but I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm so fucking scared.\n\n\\--\n\nThis will be my last entry. Caitlin went back to the cave before dawn, then I accidentally slept leaning against the door. When I finally went out to look around there were silver eyes watching me from the cave.\n\nThe mainland isn‚Äôt far. I‚Äôm casting off. If you find this I‚Äôm sorry I killed the girl. And I‚Äôm sorry I left Caitlin. I can‚Äôt believe this is how I repay her for everything. I'm the biggest piece of shit on Earth. Angelface I‚Äôm sorry. I'm so fucking sorry. Please someone rescue her. It might not be too late. Also bury the little girl.\n\n\\--\n\n**Day 1 (since rescue)**\n\nWriting this down is a terrible idea, but I need to get my thoughts straight.\n\nAfter the last entry, I pushed the boat out to sea and paddled East. Every stroke felt like a branding iron between my ribs. The marina drifted into view around midday and then a yacht came speeding toward me. I waved it down, relieved, only to discover Cat‚Äôs dad was the skipper. I almost hurled myself overboard.\n\nHe hauled me up onto the yacht and drove his forearm into my throat, pinning me against the cockpit. It‚Äôs a miracle he didn‚Äôt suffocate me.\n\nWhile I gasped for air, my vision all blurred, he explained how he‚Äôd called his daughter to wish her a happy birthday one-week ago, and when neither she nor her ‚Äòjunkie boyfriend‚Äô answered their phones, he panicked. Three days later, when a neighbour called to say his boat had disappeared, he put two-and-two together.\n\nSince the coast guard were a shower of useless bastards (his words), he launched a one-man search operation.\n\nWith his story told, he eased some pressure so that I could answer one question: where‚Äôs Caitlin?\n\nWhen I begged for water, he drove his knee into my stomach. Breathless, I lay in the foetal position and explained how we capsized, and that I needed to leave a weakened Cat behind to go summon help. If not for my feeble condition, he probably wouldn‚Äôt have accepted such vague answers. Luckily, his concern for his daughter blinded him.\n\nHe let me devour chicken sandwiches and orange juice while we sailed back to the island, although I think that was more so I didn‚Äôt die of starvation before guiding the way.\n\nBy the time we arrived, it was late afternoon. Glowing eyes watched us approach from inside the cave. I pointed feebly and said Caitlin was in there. Her dad pulled up as close as possible and insisted I go with him, probably so I couldn‚Äôt leave him behind to die.\n\nWe climbed overboard, into the water, and past the beach. When I refused to cross the mouth of the cave, the bastard grabbed me by the throat‚Äîagain. I caught him off guard with a headbutt, then blood gushed from his nostrils.\n\nA knee slammed into my chest, then two kicks to the mid-section made me fall flat on the ground clutching my burning ribs. If my future father-in-law hadn‚Äôt spotted Caitlin lurking in the shadows, I‚Äôd probably be dead right now.\n\nHe rushed forward crying out for his baby girl, who flew straight at his chest the instant he charged beyond the light. She pinned him down, her needle-like fangs bared, then tore chunks of flesh of his neck. The anguished half-gurgle half-scream almost most made me feel sorry for the guy. Almost.\n\nCaitlin stood wiping blood off her mouth. Despite the red stains, she looked more like the woman I fell in love with. Less gaunt and washed out than before. She sounded like her old self, too. That sharp edge that crept into her voice after the attack had vanished.\n\nFighting back the tears, she looked over at me and asked if she was a monster. My eyes flicked toward her father‚Äôs remains, which were basically a withered husk by that point, before I held her in my arms and said no.\n\nShe kept begging for forgiveness. Said she couldn‚Äôt help the way she came after me before‚Äîthat her craving took over. A painful thirst, she kept calling it.\n\nI caressed the back of her skull, whispering this didn‚Äôt change anything.\n\nBecause the sunlight stung, Caitlin refused to come with me on the boat. I searched the shack for a white scarf and wrapped it around her skull leaving a narrow slit for the eyes, but before we even got knee-deep in the ocean, the scarf bloomed pink. Caitlin‚Äôs hands tightened into fists as fresh blood ran down her neck, and then she scrambled for the safety of the beach.\n\nShe kept insisting being in the water felt ‚Äòwrong‚Äô. She said that when I led her towards the cabin, too, until I invited her inside where she unwrapped her head.\n\nBeneath the scarf, her delicate features looked more beautiful than ever. Crusted blood and all.\n\nWe held each other, sobbing, until there were no tears left. Then, after we talked over our predicament, I set sail for the mainland to figure things out.\n\nAt the marina, my dishevelled appearance received some funny looks from other sailors, although nobody said anything. No doubt people are asking questions, though.\n\nNow I‚Äôm at Cat‚Äôs parents‚Äô summerhouse. I slept in her father‚Äôs bed, grilled myself a steak in his kitchen, and even drank his fancy, imported beer. Apart from the aching ribs, I‚Äôm feeling world‚Äôs better now.\n\nCaitlin‚Äôs gonna need fresh meat. Or a blood bank, whatever you wanna call it. I haven‚Äôt decided my next move yet, but no matter what I‚Äôm won't abandon her. Not after everything she‚Äôs done for me. Whatever else happens, I‚Äôm sticking with my guardian angel.\n\nCat, I love you. I‚Äôll always love you. And we‚Äôre gonna figure this mess out together.\n\n[No matter what.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)",

        "text": "I‚Äôve always been a bit of a thrill-seeker, and the idea of exploring the dark web has always fascinated me. I‚Äôve heard a lot of rumors about what goes on there, from illegal drug trades to human trafficking. But what really caught my attention was a game that was supposedly only accessible through the dark web. It was called ‚ÄúThe Last Game,‚Äù and it was said to be one of the most dangerous games out there. The rumors said that no one had ever finished the game, and that those who tried never returned.\n\nBut I was determined to try it out for myself. I spent hours searching the dark web for any sign of the game, and finally, I found it. The instructions were simple: I had to complete a series of challenges, each one more difficult than the last. If I succeeded, I‚Äôd win a grand prize of $1 million. It sounded too good to be true, but I couldn‚Äôt resist.\n\nThe first few challenges were easy enough, just simple puzzles and riddles that I had to solve. But as I progressed, the challenges became more and more sinister. I was forced to confront my deepest fears, and the game seemed to know all of my darkest secrets. I felt like I was being watched, like someone was always lurking in the shadows.\n\nAnd then the game started to bleed into my real life. I‚Äôd see things out of the corner of my eye, shadows moving in my peripheral vision. I‚Äôd hear strange whispers in the dead of night, and I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I was being followed. I tried to convince myself that it was just my imagination, that I was being paranoid, but deep down, I knew that something wasn‚Äôt right.\n\nThe more I played the game, the more I realized that it was not just a game. It seemed to have a life of its own, and it was alive. It was as if it was feeding off my fear and my terror, and it was getting stronger and stronger as I progressed through the challenges.\n\nI started to lose a grip on reality, and I became consumed by the game. I was no longer able to differentiate between what was real and what was just a figment of my imagination. The game had taken over my life, and there was no turning back.\n\nFinally, I reached the last challenge, and I knew that this was it. If I failed, I‚Äôd be trapped in the game forever. I took a deep breath and plunged in, ready to face whatever lay ahead.\n\nBut the game wasn‚Äôt what I thought it was. It wasn‚Äôt just a game, it was a portal to another world, a world filled with darkness and terror. And once I crossed over, I couldn‚Äôt come back.\n\nI found myself in a place that was beyond description. It was a world of darkness and evil, a place where nightmares came to life. The air was thick with the stench of death and decay, and I could feel the weight of the darkness bearing down on me.\n\nI knew then that I had made a terrible mistake. I had played with forces that I could not comprehend, and now I was paying the price. I was trapped in a place of eternal torment, and there was no escape.\n\nI can feel my sanity slipping away with each passing moment. The darkness has consumed me, and I'm now a prisoner of my own mind. I'm not sure how long I've been here, but time seems to have lost all meaning. Days blend into nights, and the only companions I have are the howling winds and the whispers of the dead.\n\nI've tried to find a way out, but all my efforts have been in vain. The game seems to have taken on a life of its own, and it's now beyond my control. I'm a mere pawn in its twisted game, a plaything to be toyed with and discarded at will.\n\nSometimes I catch glimpses of other players, lost souls like myself who have fallen victim to the game. They come and go, and I never know if they're real or just a figment of my imagination. But one thing is clear: they're all as trapped as I am, and there's no way out.\n\nThe game has become my entire world, and I'm now a slave to its dark whims. It's as if it's alive, and it's feeding off my despair and hopelessness. I'm no longer the person I was before I played the game. I'm now a shell of my former self, a broken and twisted version of who I used to be.\n\nThe darkness is all-consuming, and I can feel myself slipping further into its abyss with each passing day. The only thing that keeps me going is the hope that someday, somehow, I'll find a way out of this nightmare.\n\nBut for now, I'm trapped in this twisted game, a prisoner of my own making. And I know that there's no escape.\n\nSo please, if you're reading this, heed my warning. Stay away from the dark web, and avoid \"The Last Game\" at all costs. It's not worth the risk. The consequences are too great, and the price is too high. Don't make the same mistake that I did.\n\nRun. Run as far away as you can, and don't look back. Because once you enter the game, there's no turning back. The darkness will consume you, and it will never let you go.",

        "text": "The night was still and silent, and I was sound asleep in my bed when a sudden, shrill ringing jolted me awake. Groggily, I fumbled for my phone on the bedside table and answered the call from an unknown number.\n\n\"Hello?\" I said, my voice hoarse and scratchy from sleep.\n\n\"Is this Joseph?\" a voice on the other end asked. It sounded unfamiliar and sent a shiver down my spine.\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, rubbing my eyes to clear the grogginess.\n\nThe voice proceeded to ask me a strange question about the layout of my house. I found it odd, but I answered anyway, not thinking much of it.\n\nFor weeks after that strange phone call, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. Every creak and rustle in my home seemed louder, more sinister. Every shadow seemed darker, more ominous.\n\nThen, one night, I heard a sound that made my blood run cold. It was a scratching at my bedroom door, and I froze in terror. I lay there, paralyzed with fear, as the scratching grew louder and more insistent. Someone or something was trying to get into my room.\n\nI tried to shake off the fear, to tell myself it was just my imagination or some animal outside. But the scratching continued, as if whoever or whatever was on the other side was determined to break through. I could hear my own heartbeat pounding in my ears as the scratching went on and on.\n\nWhen it finally stopped, I lay there in silence, my ears straining for any sound. But there was none. I was left alone in the darkness, with only my fear and paranoia for company.\n\nThe next morning, I checked my bedroom door and found deep scratches in the wood. It looked like someone or something had been trying to claw their way through.\n\nI knew I had to take action. I installed cameras around my house, hoping to catch a glimpse of whoever or whatever was stalking me. But every time I reviewed the footage, there was nothing there. No sign of anyone or anything.\n\nAs the days went on, my fear grew to an unbearable level. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. Every time I left my house, I felt like I was being followed. I started to see strange figures in the corners of my vision, but when I turned to look, there was no one there.\n\nThen, the photos started arriving. They were pictures of me, taken from a distance. I couldn't see who had taken them, but I knew someone was watching me.\n\nMy fear turned to desperation, and I hired a private investigator. But even the investigator couldn't find anything concrete. It was like whoever was after me was always one step ahead.\n\nOne night, I woke up to find a figure standing at the foot of my bed. It was the same figure I had seen in my peripheral vision for weeks, but now it was right in front of me.\n\nThe figure was tall and shadowy, with glowing eyes that seemed to pierce my soul. I tried to scream, but no sound came out. The figure simply stared at me for a long moment then raised it‚Äôs long claw like  hands,\n\nI knew that I was going to die. I had felt it coming for weeks, and now it was here. I closed my eyes and waited for the end.\n\nBut when I opened them again, I was alive. The figure was gone, and I was alone in my room. I couldn't explain what had happened, but I knew that I had been given a second chance.\n\nThe next day, I received a package in the mail. Inside was a note that read, \"You got lucky this time. But I'm still watching.\" I knew that I had to leave my home behind and start a new life, I packed my bags and left the next morning.",

        "text": "\"Good morning class! I would like you all to welcome Mary Spencer!\"¬†\n\n\n¬†I looked up from doodling in my sketchbook. Mary looked like your typical 16 year old girl. Pretty, good looking.¬† She'll be popular in no time.¬†\n\n\n¬†I just sighed and went back to my drawings. I'm a artist. I'm not what you would say bad looking but I'm not that popular either. If she was another dude maybe I could've made a friend you know?¬†\n\n\n¬†Mrs. Kay tells Mary about finding her a desk. To my surprise she picked the one behind me while everyone else whispers to themselves.¬†\n\n\n¬†I quickly put my sketchbook into my backpack as to not let her see how lame I was.¬†\n\n\n¬†As she Sat down she past me a smile and I just nodded right back.¬†\n\n\n¬†The class went on with her talking about how Christopher Columbus wasn't the inly one to settle on America blah blah blah. When the bell rang I went to my locker. As I was changing books amd shut it I jumped cause she was literally close to me.¬†\n\n\n¬†\"Um‚Ä¶ can I see what you drew?\" She asks shyly.¬†\n\n\n¬†I was appalled. I thought that she didn't see me put the notebook into my bag but I guess I wasn't as discrete as i thought I was. I handed it to her and she pans through the pages. Other kids in the hallway just kept giving us weird looks as they were walking.¬†\n\n\n¬†\"Oh my god these are actually pretty good!\"¬†\n\n\n¬†My heart lifted. The fact that someone likes my drawings always gives me comfort to keep doing. I've grown a little bit of a following on Twitter doing commissions for people that like it as well.¬†\n\n\n¬†\"You think you can draw me something?\"¬†\n\n\n¬†I just realized that I haven't even said a word to her. \"Um, yeah sure. What would you like me to draw for you?\"¬†\n\n\n¬†In a quick motion she pointed her fingers at her. \"You can do self portraits right?\"¬†\n\n\n¬†Self portraits are the easiest kind of things that I can do. \"Yeah. It will probably take me a while though\". She nods her head excitedly. Then she reaches her hand flat out to me.\n\n\n¬†\"I'm going to need to see your socials that way I can keep in touch with you.\"¬†\n\n\n¬†Let me tell you I almost dropped to the floor at that moment. My hand shaking nervously I give her my phone. She then starts to add all her information on it. As she gives my phone back she says,\" I also gave you my number that way I can check on it ok?\"¬†\n\n\n¬†That made my heart sink a little as now I know she doesn't see me as a interest.¬†\n\n\n¬†When I got home and put my stuff up I went into my bedroom and set at my work desk and pulled out my sketchbook. Since all of the kids in my school get their school work done during the day we rarely have homework. I hear a notification from my phone.\n\n\n¬†Hey. Just want to know if you can have it done by Friday?¬†\n\n\n¬†I think about her face and hair style and think that maybe if I focused on nothing else I can do it in a week.¬†\n\n\n¬†Ok.¬†\n\n\n¬†:)\n\n\n¬†I started to work. I went through all her socials and picked the pictures that I thought was the best. I went and started working. After a while I realized I could be done by that night. So after dinner I just kept drawing and drawing.¬†\n\n\n¬†Next morning when she came to my locker she was suprised when I showed it to her. \"Oh my god you finished it in one night!\" She yells after holding up her self portrait.¬†\n\n\n¬†\"Yeah. I guess you were nust easy to draw.\"\n\n\n¬†She then frowned at my comment.¬†\n\n\n¬†I realized what I had just said. \"No. No, what I'm saying is that your face has a nice posture?\" I crossed my fingers behind my back hoping that she still wouldn't yell at me.¬†\n\n\n¬†Her face then calmed down. \"Ok!\" She said in a smile and went.¬†\n\n\n¬†Later that night I got another message from her. This is what it said:\n\n\n¬†Hey again! One of my family members really liked your drawing! They took it and shared it on Facebook. Now a few of my other family members want the same picture! Can you do that?¬†\n\n\n¬†I sighed. Didn't really know how to answer her on that. I mean. When people do stuff like this they get paid. I just thought of this as a way of her family members seeing how happy she is here. So I replied back.¬†\n\n\n¬†Hey. Yeah I'm down to do a few. How many pictures are you talking?¬†\n\n\n¬†It took a few moments until she sent me another message.¬†\n\n\n¬†Yeah sure! It'll only be 5. I promise that after that I will be done!¬†\n\n\n¬†That meant that after I do these she won't talk to me again.¬†\n\n\n¬†Ok. It will be a very long time before you get them.¬†\n\n\n¬†She replies.\n\n\n¬†Ok. :)¬†\n\n\n¬†I then spent many of my free time drawing her. At first I kind of thought of this as being creepy. But then thought again that she was the one that asked for them. I tried to get a different look for each drawing. Make them more unique.\n\n\n¬†So i really studied her Instagram, Snapchat and Tiktok for the following month.¬†¬†\n\n\n¬†I only noticed the changes after a couple of months. If any one else did this that wasn't an artist probably wouldn't notice at first either. In the third drawing her cheekbones were a little higher than usual. Then the color of her irisis started changing hues.¬†\n\n\n¬†I just couldn't comprehend it at first. My first logical conclusion is that it was because I was drawing her all of the time. Yeah, that must be it.¬†\n\n\n¬†So after a couple of days break from drawing I went to the next one. This time I was going to use the newer pictures that she post everyday. As I was drawing I got a sick feeling in my stomach. Something was telling me not to continue.¬†\n\n\n¬†But I did. Let me tell you it was getting stranger by the minute. Was her face a bit higher this time? It was. Everyday that i drew her more of the slight changes became bigger.¬†\n\n\n¬†I'm confused. How is this possible?\n\n\n¬†Whenever I finally got done with them drawings I gave them to her. She was so excited that she hugged me. What scared me though was what she whispered in my ear.¬†\n\n\n¬†\"You are a perfect artist. Maybe you should draw me everyday.\"¬†\n\n\n¬†She then let go of me and skipped down the hallway. I was shivering with fear. The coldness in her voice when she said that.¬†\n\n\n¬†After that instead of drawing more I spent days studying her pictures. I was right and wasn't going crazy. Every picture she took a slight change was wrong with her face.¬†\n\n\n¬†This creeped me out even more. I finally decided that she wasn't human. I looked online and concluded that she must be skinwalker. The reason I'm typing all of this now on here is because I recieved a message from her.¬†\n\n\n¬†Hey. You wanna come over to my house?

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11cnp47/theres_a_deceiver_in_the_hills_of_utah_1/)\n.\n\nHey all. A lot has happened during the past day or so. I‚Äôve calmed down a bit, so hopefully my writing will make some sense.\n\nMuch to my delight, Annie was enthralled to join me in this, and came over to my place pretty much as soon as the text appeared as read.\n\nI brought her up to speed on the info I‚Äôve gotten, thanks once again to Davis. Annie is much more tech-y than I am, so she took the reins in researching any possible leads concerning the kid‚Äôs online presence.\n\nAfter a few search queries and new tabs, she found a matching Facebook page for Aiden O‚ÄôLeary. Luckily for us, he seemed to be quite active on the site, posting pictures and videos of events and places he‚Äôd been to.\n\nOf course, what we were looking for was anything that could hint us to his last known location. And lo and behold, that‚Äôs exactly what we found. Well, we assumed that to be so, given his following radio silence.\n\nIt was a selfie picture of himself and a friend on a hiking trail somewhere up in the hills. Both were kitted out with the generic set of backpacks, cargo shorts, sunglasses, the whole package. The image was captioned,\n\n‚ÄúWhat a great day to be out in nature! Wish you guys could see the view from up here.‚Äù\n\nEven better, there was a location tag on the post. Nothing specific, of course, but it was labelled as being in or around the Salt Point trails, a network of time-worn paths hewn throughout an area of the local hill range. The place was almost a 50 minute drive away, which, on the scale of the country, is nothing at all.\n\nWith some additional link-clicking, we discovered that the buddy he‚Äôd been out with, along with himself, had been reported missing over 2 weeks ago. I don‚Äôt mean to be rude, Davis, but during that time I hadn‚Äôt even heard of this, let alone any efforts to track them down.\n\nAnyhow, Annie and I had a free schedule for a good few days, so we decided on heading out there straight away. We made sure to pack all the necessary things: food, hiking poles, a small tent, probably more power banks than we needed, you get the picture. I may be a journalist, but I‚Äôve gone on my fair share of treks living in this part of the country. I mean, how could you not? Sure, it can get sweltering in the summer months, but quite frankly that is easily ignored in favour of seeing the exquisite landscape. Besides, it‚Äôs spring anyway; not too hot, not too cold, but just right.\n\nI was relieved to find Annie‚Äôs backup screenwash bottle by the time we arrived. Must have used two thirds of the tank already washing away the orange dust, that gathered around the windshield the way iron filings would to a magnet.\n\nAnnie isn‚Äôt a small person by any means, but with myself being 6‚Äô1‚Äù, I was bestowed the burden of carrying the heaviest load. In other words, I ended up lugging the tent bag up rocky, arid slopes and through spiky tallgrass. No luck found us for over an hour as we plodded on through the heat.\n\nAfter summitting a particularly merciless hill, I was caught off guard by Annie pointing something out with an abrupt, ‚ÄúLOOK!‚Äù\n\nI came to a stop and dropped my pack, giving myself a breather.\n\n‚ÄúWhat? If you‚Äôre gawking at those trees over there, just keep in mind we didn‚Äôt come out here to absorb nature.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHuh? No, Lou, look at the ground over there.‚Äù\n\nI followed the direction of her outstretched finger to see what looked like heavy and rushed footprints in the sand ahead of us. They weren‚Äôt anything special, maybe left behind by a jogger or something. I didn‚Äôt really understand what had Annie so captivated.\n\n‚ÄúUgh, you really need me to point it out for you? An investigative journalist?‚Äù she gasped, still out of breath.\n\n‚ÄúYeah, actually. They‚Äôre just footprints.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, look. Clearly, whoever made these was running in the opposite direction to us, and they lead off the trail just over there.‚Äù\n\nI looked over in turn and she was right. It still wasn‚Äôt anything particularly noteworthy, but it did stir my thinking brain into wondering where this person had come from, out in the brush, and why they had been in such a hurry.\n\n‚ÄúNo stone left unturned.‚Äù Annie said smugly.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not even how you use that- ah, fine. Noted.‚Äù\n\nWe continued along the track, heads swivelled to the left to see if we could track the prints any further. To our surprise, the prints came back up onto the trail, at which point a large area of scuffed sand and rocks became apparent.\n\n‚ÄúHmm. A scuffle, looks like. What from, though?‚Äù I pondered. Annie simply nodded as she observed the surroundings, panning around for any further details.\n\nShe seemed to do a double-take, and stared at something.\n\n‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ does that look like a rock to you?‚Äù she said, her tone lowered.\n\nI gazed over to what she was seeing and was struck with a similar confusion.\n\nA football-sized stone lay beside the disturbed sand, but I‚Äôd never seen anything like it. Parts of it shined, glistened with an odd, desaturated hue. I say that because the stone here is generally orange or red, but the spots where the sun glinted off, almost dazzlingly, were much closer to grey in colour. On top of that, it had a bizarre texture to it, wavy and grooved, almost like‚Ä¶\n\nAnnie cautiously approached the foreign object, then crouched down, swiping brunette strands out of her face. She prodded it with her walking pole. My brow furrowed further when, in response, the thing *jiggled*. Like it was made of jelly.\n\n‚ÄúWait, no, it‚Äôs- holy shit. Lou‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a brain.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWh‚Ä¶what?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúA brain! I‚Äôm no anatomist, but that looks awfully similar to a- a *human brain*.‚Äù\n\nThe realisation made me recoil in disgust, and with morbidly comedic timing, the smell hit my nostrils. The sickly-sweet stench of past-fresh meat, festering in the midday heat.\n\nBut it didn‚Äôt smell like your bog-standard rotten flesh. No, there was an almost smoky hint to it. One could have chalked that up to the sun acting as an open cooker, but after willing myself to inspect the brain more closely, I realised it was covered in scorches and severe burn marks.\n\n‚ÄúHey, it doesn‚Äôt look like there was any wildfire here, right?‚Äù I asked Annie, who‚Äôd also noticed the oddity.\n\n‚ÄúIf there was, it was a stealthy one.‚Äù she half-heartedly joked. Not the time, Annie.\n\nWe should‚Äôve turned back, then. I don‚Äôt know why we kept going. Maybe because I‚Äôd been running dry on meaty stories, maybe to get to the bottom of this conundrum, I don‚Äôt know. It was irresponsible, yeah, but something deeper in the mountains was calling out to me, asking me to come and see what it‚Äôs hiding.\n\nThe terrain was more forgiving now, at the very least, and with the sunset came a cool blanket of dusk air, which felt great. We settled on walking for another 30 or 40 minutes before setting up camp and calling it a day.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt help but feel uneasy, hiking through the quickly darkening valley, though thankfully the right of the path was mostly clear, giving the growing moonlight a straight shot to illuminate our route.\n\nDarkness took residence in the shrubs and trees around us. At some point, I can‚Äôt remember when, I got the distinct feeling that we were being watched, from somewhere out of sight. A few times I thought I heard rustling nearby, but remained vigilant, keeping the lid on the creeping dread that wished to overtake me.\n\nI was so focused on settling my mind that I didn‚Äôt even notice Annie had stopped dead in her tracks, and I bumped into her back. I went to apologise, before seeing her frozen stance. Understanding it was best to keep quiet, I followed her gaze to see, to my horror, a hairy face peeking out from the bushes to our left.\n\nThe fluorescent green eyeshine from Annie‚Äôs torch betrayed a god-damned mountain lion. Of course. Just our luck. The bastard had probably only just now come out to hunt, and its eyes were set on us. If you ever come across a mountain lion out in the hills, you can be sure that it saw you a good while before you noticed.\n\nIt seemed to register its hiding place had been foiled, and it slinked out onto the path ahead of us.\n\n‚ÄúSlowly, back away,‚Äù I whispered. I remembered then the rule of making yourself as big as possible, but we had no coats to spread open. So, I came closer to Annie, and said,\n\n‚ÄúHey, get up on my shoulders, quick.‚Äù\n\nShe understood my intent and followed my instructions, after I had bent down onto one knee. I grasped her shins in my hands and stood back up with some effort.\n\nThe big cat didn‚Äôt seem to like this, and recoiled momentarily, before composing itself and letting out a low growl. If you‚Äôve ever heard the growl of a mountain lion, you‚Äôll understand the primal fear it instils.\n\nMethodically, it resumed its movement toward us, testing the limits to see how close it could get before striking. Panicking, I kicked a stone at it with as much force as someone carrying a person could give. It yowled in surprise for a second, but this one was determined, and continued its approach.\n\nIt was then that the rapidly forming cloud formation that smothered the moonlight came to my attention. Somewhere far above the peaks ahead, swirling grey clouds grew into a dense mass of mind-bending coils.\n\nIt happened so suddenly that I almost dropped Annie. An intense light flickered on from somewhere inside that murky nebula, before an intense beam of light erupted from within. It was the most powerful spotlight I‚Äôd ever seen, panning across the valley in saccade-like movements, searching for‚Ä¶ something. Every time it swivelled, a distant vibration could be heard, which I imagine is what also drew the mountain lion‚Äôs attention away from us.\n\nBefore it could even turn all the way to look, the white floodlight fell upon it. Instantly, the cat fell onto its side, yowling and screeching while it convulsed in pain.\n\nEven from a distance, I could see its hairs singe and smoke, its skin bubbling as if exposed to the surface of the sun, before pale white flames spewed out from its eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, and in an instant completely engulfed the wailing animal.\n\nThe poor creature screamed unrelentingly for what felt like hours, when in reality it was more like 20 seconds or so, until just as quickly as it had settled, the spotlight started its frantic motion once more.\n\nAnnie broke our shared stupor, and pushed herself off of my shoulders with adrenaline-fueled agility. She grabbed me by the wrist and hauled me over to a large boulder off to the right to take cover.\n\nMere seconds after we reached it, the gleam cast the rock‚Äôs shadow, which stretched out far behind us. There we sat, shivering in fear, contrasting the unmoving light that waited for us to emerge.\n\nFor the following five minutes, my heart yearned to leap out from my chest. So when we were once again plunged into darkness, the relief washed over me in waves. I waited another few minutes, looking into Annie‚Äôs wide, grey eyes, before daring to glance out from behind the rock.\n\nThose clouds were gone, but underneath where they once were I saw something that, somehow, I hadn‚Äôt initially seen. There looked to be some building higher up on the slope of a large hill ‚Äì it was dark, and distant, but even then I recognised the architecture to be unlike any other structure you might find in the state, hell, the country even.\n\nAfter feeling like I‚Äôd stared longer than considered safe, I returned behind the boulder and looked over to Annie, who was just as shaken as I. With an effort to ignore the smell of burnt hair and flesh, we set up our tent without a word, and climbed inside.\n\nThank god there‚Äôs reception out here. The sole fact of having access to the internet calmed my nerves enough for me to write this up.\n\nWe‚Äôre gonna sleep this feeling off, hopefully. I haven‚Äôt told Annie about that building up ahead. I‚Äôll show her tomorrow, but even then it‚Äôll take some convincing to get her to come. I know, I know, how could I possibly want to go any further after what I‚Äôve just seen? Call me crazy, but the events of today have only added more fuel to the fire of my intrigue.\n\n[I'll report back after whatever happens tomorrow. Stay safe, everyone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rephlect/comments/11di5jh/theres_a_deceiver_in_the_hills_of_utah_2/)",

        "text": "Randy and I are film students in Thailand. We‚Äôve been wanting to film a ride-along with corpse collectors for a long time. Corpse collectors are part of Thai first responders. They collect bodies and detached limbs from the scene and deliver them to a coroner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought they kept rescheduling until Randy finally admitted that he lied. He just wanted our ride-along to happen during a full moon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could strangle Randy. We were 3 days away from the due date. Randy‚Äôs excuse was that our seniors‚Äô videos were too tame. He wanted to film something shocking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur contact in a corpse collector foundation is Ben, who played CS:GO with us since primary school, but he didn‚Äôt follow us to college. I asked Ben if there was any truth that things will be more hectic during the full moon. Ben smiled and said that tonight wasn‚Äôt just a full moon. It was a Friday, and, more importantly, payday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first stop was at 6.00 PM. Ben and Sam had to dive into a small dirty canal to retrieve a murder weapon that a recently caught serial killer threw in. Since we can‚Äôt dive down with them and film we just waited.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the second stop, Ben and Sam had to comb the kitchen floor of a house, trying to find and collect all of the fingers that belonged to the homeowner. His wife had accidentally chopped all of his left-hand fingers off as they were arguing over a TV remote. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I was filming Ben and Sam on all fours, I could tell Randy started to get bored. That‚Äôs when he started pushing for ‚Äòbetter‚Äô content. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRandy stuck his camera in Sam‚Äôs face and asked how he feel about corpse collectors being hated by the Thai public. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe corpse collectors are funded by donations, not taxpayer‚Äôs money; so they are often rough around the edges, as they don‚Äôt feel like they owe the public anything. Stereotypes about them include driving like traffic laws are merely suggestions, getting into fights, taking selfies with dead bodies, and charging a still-living person for a ride to the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of the questions Randy asked Sam were so offensive I won‚Äôt type them here. Ben laughed and answered in Sam‚Äôs place. He said that the public‚Äôs hatred of them was understandable as they are the literal grim reapers. Some people think just seeing their car on the road was a bad omen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe arrived at our third stop and the air felt different. It was completely dark. No wind and no sound of insects. A dog could be heard howling in the distance. A police car passed us while we were walking to the scene. A cop rolled down his window, pointed to a small alley, and said, **your dead body walked that way.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll four of us were confused about what he meant. When we got there, we saw a crowd blocking a small alleyway between two apartment buildings. Ben and Sam pushed through, and we tried our best to pretend that we were one of them (we had a sticker of the foundation‚Äôs logo on our shirt).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we finally got a look, we saw him. He was an old man with a cleaver buried in his head. It was like he didn‚Äôt know he was dead and was still walking. He kept pushing people away from him. His strength was surprising. Two full-grown men fell to the ground from the force of his shoving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA woman in the crowd kept yelling, Where are you going? Please stop. The man with a cleaver in his head finally took a seat on the bench. According to one of the onlookers, that was where he fed the pigeons every evening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was so shocked at the sight, I didn‚Äôt notice Randy moved past me. Randy went right up into the old man‚Äôs face and just started filming. The man didn‚Äôt look into the camera. After Randy moved around him, trying to get a different angle, the old man slowly slouched over and passed away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to scold Randy, but the onlookers and the corpse collectors didn‚Äôt, so I thought I shouldn‚Äôt either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile Ben and Sam talked to the old man‚Äôs family, Randy and I got back to the car. Randy playback the raw clip he filmed on his DSLR, his face full of pride. When we got to the clip of the old man, it showed the old man staring directly right into the camera, right at us. I was so startled my heart skipped a beat. Randy almost dropped the camera. We both looked at each other. It was clear that both of us were sure he didn‚Äôt look into the camera at any point while Randy was filming. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile on our way to the coroner‚Äôs office, I looked through the rearview mirror and could have sworn I saw the old man sitting up at the back of the truck. It could have been the wind moving the bag, I told myself. I didn‚Äôt want the others to think I couldn‚Äôt take it and started freaking out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were at a traffic light in a still pretty remote area at the edge of the city, and a pack of stray dogs started barking at our car. Sam looked at the dogs confoundingly.  Suddenly Sam started freaking out when he saw Randy through the rearview mirror.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSam got out of the car, opened the passenger door, and dragged Randy out by his shirt collar. We were confused about what was going on. Sam showed Randy‚Äôs sticker to Ben. Ben closed his eyes and shook his head in disbelief. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEarlier, before we left the headquarter, we were given stickers with the logo of this particular corpse collector‚Äôs foundation. Sam and Ben made sure we put it on and took a look at us before they okayed us to get into their car. We just assumed they want people to think we belonged at the crime scene. But that was not the main reason.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are several corpse collector foundations, but if you look at their logos there was something similar in all of them. The logos all had a symbol incorporated into them, and that symbol served the function of warding off evil spirits. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took a look at Randy‚Äôs sticker and couldn‚Äôt believe it. **His sticker was upside down.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBen and Sam made sure we put our stickers on correctly. The fact that it was upside down must be deliberate. When Sam threatened to leave Randy in the middle of a road at night, surrounded by woods with no building in sight, Randy started to apologize profusely. He admitted that he put it upside down just to see what would happen because so far the night had been so boring.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSam yelled that the upside-down symbol is an invitation and that we were now marked. While Ben tried to calm him down, Randy and I looked closely at the stray dogs. I gasped when I saw that none of them have eyes. And, I thought I was seeing things, but I thought one of them that was furthest away looked like it didn‚Äôt have a head. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe dogs were not barking anymore. They didn‚Äôt even look at us. They were looking into the field next to us. And that was when we saw it. Pale naked people. They seem to be about 7-8 feet tall, judging from the distance. Standing in rows. Slowly marching towards us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to tell Ben and Sam, but when I turned, I was shocked to see the cleaved old man clutching onto the side of the cargo bed like it was a side pillow. He was not moving, but he had a grin that he didn‚Äôt have before. I felt my soul leave the body. I wanted to collapse on the ground so badly and just weep. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turned to look at Ben and Sam to gauge their reaction. Ben just sighed and shove the old man‚Äôs body deeper into the bag and tie it up completely. Sam finally allowed Randy back into the car but said that they will drop Randy off at the dorm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked at the row of pale naked people and was creeped out by how much closer they were to us now. Like the dogs, none of them have eyes. It was so surreal to me that Ben and Sam were not panicked, though they do seem frustrated. I was so scared I could throw up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBen saw that I was fixated on the figures. Ben told me to remember the old Thai adage. I knew he was talking about an old Thai saying: do not call out anything that looked like a ghost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile inside the car, several calls were coming in. The dispatcher asked Ben and Sam to go to a nearby school where a drunken man with a gun climbed onto the cell tower demanding to see his wife. Ben, however, radioed in and said they have to make a detour and dropped one of us off at the dorm first because we were all marked by evil spirits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought for sure the dispatcher was going to yell at Ben. But, he just told Ben he was sorry that happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the way back to our dorm, while in the car, I saw a reflection on the glass window of a building. A man was standing on top of the roof of our car. I almost said something. My mouth was opened, but then I remember the adage and thanked god no sound came out. In the next window, the man disappeared. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRandy himself was quiet. He knew that Ben and Sam didn‚Äôt have to drive them back to the dorm, but they did anyway. Once we were on the road that lead right to our dorm, however, Randy became braver. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe asked what it meant to be marked, and if there was something he could do. Ben said that their boss could cleanse him, but he won‚Äôt do it tonight. Not on payday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRandy became agitated. He begged for their help. Sam taunted that he could drop Randy off at the temple if he wanted. Randy started cursing at them. Claiming that they are abandoning him because of the question he asked earlier while they were collecting fingers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBen gave Randy a sticker with their foundation‚Äôs logo on it and told Randy to put it on the door of his room and not open it for anyone. That should help him survive the night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRandy was jumped by the sound of the dog howling and he started crying. Benand Sam were unmoved. I told Randy I would collect plenty of footage for our movie, and I could tell Randy couldn‚Äôt care less. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe finally made our way to the coroner‚Äôs office to drop off the old man. The coroner's office was conveniently right next to the headquarter of the corpse collection foundation. Sam radioed a security named Rita who was guarding the gate. He asked her how many people she sees inside our car. She said five. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBen turned to me and said two extra people came with us and that Rita could see them. Normally the logo would prevent any spirit from attaching itself to our car, but some of them are powerful enough to override it. They still could not get inside the car though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs Ben and Sam took the old man‚Äôs body to the coroner, I waited outside. I suddenly felt like I had to use the restroom. I could see that the men‚Äôs room was at the end of the a hallway. But, lights were coming out of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I moved closer, I could hear people talking, and laughing, almost like they had a party in there. I thought, well, this was not that scary. Then I opened the door, and there was nothing. There was no one in there. I ran as fast as I could back to the central area where some other people were sitting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, on my phone, Randy sent me messages. He said that the abandoned half-constructed building opposite our dorm suddenly have a bunch of people standing on them looking right into his dorm room‚Äôs window. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI messaged him back saying to follow Ben‚Äôs advice and not open the door, but Randy just swore at me and said that this was all my fault. I didn‚Äôt know what to say.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe dispatcher, who was also Ben‚Äôs boss, came to pat me on the back. He was scary looking but seemed like a nice guy. He laughed like a jolly Santa, and asked me if I had fun and if I got enough footage for my assignment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI nodded, then took out my camera, hoping to show him some footage. My heart dropped when I saw that all the 100+ video clips had a thumbnail of the old man looking into the camera. And the files all have 0 bytes of memory. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe dispatcher closed his eyes and nodded in understanding. He then casually told me that he knew some people who were marked and ended up gouging their own eyes out, couldnt take what they were seeing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWishing he didn‚Äôt tell me that, I sat down on the curb and wiped my face with both hands, telling him that it has been a long night. The dispatcher laughed, patted me on the back again, and told me that it was only 8.00 PM.",

Rats the size of dogs scurried to safety inside metal trash bins or the sewers, junkies with their veins hanging from their arms barely held on to life, and I, a nobody, crumbled away under the weight of this monotonous, bleak life.\n\nIt didn‚Äôt bring me comfort thinking about tomorrow, no. *Alarm, wake up tired, mutter bad words, drink coffee, eat breakfast, take cold shower, brush teeth, dress nicely, put on a fake smile, and things would be A-okay*. Another day, another demise. One step closer to the end of the charade. What a spectacle! The crowd goes wild. Curtains fall. Lights out. Absolute silence.\n\n‚ÄúWatch where you‚Äôre going, asshole!‚Äù a madman from a car yelled at me. I stopped and realized I was in the middle of the street. The car had hit the brakes a few inches away from my legs. The man continued cussing and honked. ‚ÄúYou wanna get yourself killed, dickhead? Move out the fucking way!‚Äù \n\nI raised my hand and whispered sorry. He drove past me in a rush, the tires screeching violently. Lucky me.\n\nI walked, the dark thoughts beginning to fog my mind again with each step I took. The air smelled like piss and rotten eggs. It made me feel sick to my stomach. \n\nTime passed, and I became lost once again inside my head. After going where my feet took me, I found myself in a part of town I didn‚Äôt know. It seemed off-place, almost as if an unknown constructor took a part of a strange city and moved it here with its residents. Yet, the putrescence had not vanished. \n\nI glanced around the tall, undulating buildings. They all looked abandoned and inhabited at the same time. Some of the apartments had the lights turned on, and behind each window, I could see a shadowy silhouette studying me with wonder. Hundreds of eyes inspecting me as if I didn‚Äôt belong there. Whenever I looked at one of the windows, the person inside waved at me. Slowly, left and right, left and right. They all looked like human clocks, counting each second in that place.\n\nI wanted to turn back. But, instead, I glanced behind and saw that the street stretched out into the blackness, seemingly with no end. This place had me trapped there.\n\nA maelstrom of fear and despair began taking shape inside my heart. The more I stayed there, the more it felt like nothing was what it seemed. The mystery of this side of town extended its black and slimy tentacles at me, trying to wrap around my sanity and squeeze it until it would suffocate and leave me utterly mad.\n\nWith extreme caution and heightened senses, I moved forward into the strip of blackness. The stars above stared at me with contempt and disgust. They blinked as if an invisible hand of doom clicked them on and off. \n\nThe fear inside my chest spread its tiny claws, trying to grab whatever it could find. It screamed as if it wanted to shatter my heart into a million little pieces. A heart made of obsidian, its sharp parts collapsing on the floor of my soul as if a morbid symphony creaked its tune for the end of the world.\n\nApart from the people in the windows waving at me, I had seen no one else. Not a single soul, not even a car moving, nothing.  I walked for a few more minutes. Again, nothing moved, nothing breathed.\n\n*You‚Äôre trapped here, man. What the hell is going on?* I whispered to myself.\n\nI heard a buzzing sound growing louder as I approached a back alley. A man soiled in grease, wearing only a pair of black shorts, stood before an old TV set. I heard him muttering some words but didn‚Äôt understand what he said. At first, I was excited to see and hear from another fellow human being. However, he didn‚Äôt even acknowledge my presence as I approached him. \n\nI stood for a few moments behind me as the TV hypnotized him.\n\n‚ÄúYes, I am. Yes, I am. I am here. I am yours. Forever in your service, forever in your debt. You have made me what I am. Your child, your creation. You showed the true colors of this world. Master, I thank you for my life. Master, I will endure. I am nothing without you. My Master, My Lord, My God. I bow down to you forever,‚Äù he said, swaying to and fro like a puppet made of flesh and bone with no soul or mind.\n\n‚ÄúHey, can you hear me?‚Äù I asked.\n\nNothing. He just repeated all those words over and over and over again. He chanted them like in a ritual. Then he stopped all of a sudden. He froze, his gaze still on the TV.\n\n‚ÄúNo one is here. No, I didn‚Äôt betray you. Behind me? A man?‚Äù he said. I stepped back as the man rose and turned to face me.\n\nHe had static in his eyes. The buzzing was nauseating; behind all the crackling noise, a voice whispered terrible things to him. An evil agent that fed the poor man‚Äôs mind with toxic, infectious thoughts.\n\nThe man lunged at me. He grabbed my shoulders and squeezed hard. I froze as the static in his eyes grew louder. I didn‚Äôt feel in any danger, but the fear remained. Apart from his body, what he had inside was long gone and replaced with something artificial.\n\nThe supernatural was present in this man. An evil, powerful force twisted his mind and played with his soul until there was nothing. The puppeteer pulled the strings carefully until the man crumbled and served his master‚Äôs will.\n\n‚ÄúYou need to go now. Master Leonardo is waiting for you. He will give you the gift of knowledge. He will make you see beyond the veil of human perception. Right where this world ends, you will feel extraordinary sensations. Yet, Master knows how to make it all work. He can tap into that world and make you see amazing things. Just go,‚Äù the man spoke like a robot. He lifted his right hand and pointed upwards on the street.\n\nAfter my heart rate settled down, I looked at the end of the street. There I saw a flickering streetlight in front of what appeared to be an abandoned small house.\n\nThis, of course, felt unnatural to me. It seemed like that house had just manifested itself out of thin air. I was sure that in that place where only tall concrete apartment buildings seemed to exist‚Äîthey felt more like prisons to me‚Äî a house would be the last thing anyone would build. Why would they? The whole scenery would suffocate it out of existence, infect it with the desolation of that place, and make it fade away and die.\n\nThe man returned to the TV set and began muttering the words in an unknown language. I walked the street until the end. Then, the flickering lamp post stopped working, and everything went pitch black. I heard the house creak and a door close shut. The lights turned on inside the house, and a tall silhouette stood behind the window. I couldn‚Äôt see who it was.\n\nA purple light buzzed and made the house come to life. The words LEONARDO SORPRENDENTE‚ÄôS BOUTIQUE OF WONDERS appeared on the roof.\n\nThe front door opened.  The silhouette in the window waved its hand at me, then invited me over. I could make out a thin man wearing a top hat as I approached the house.\n\nI entered, the entrance bell chimed, and a bubblegum smell permeated the air. The man looked at me with black eyes and greenish-yellow teeth as if he had brushed his teeth with radioactive toothpaste. \n\nHe stood there motionless and smiling. The ravenous smile that spread from ear to ear had to be the most frightening thing I had ever seen. He wore a purple and orange pinstripe suit that made me dizzy. His long black hair hung on his shoulders in wet strands as if he had just emerged from a long-forgotten underwater cave. \n\n‚ÄúWelcome to Leonardo Sorprendente‚Äôs Boutique of Wonders! You arrived just in time for our latest auction. Our lots this evening are of the rarest form, and I am sure you will be delighted to see them. Remember that all sales are final, and payments must be made at the end of the auction,‚Äù the man said. \n\nIn all this time, he didn‚Äôt move. Not even his lips moved when he talked. He stood there like a mannequin, and the voice came from a deep, dark place at the world‚Äôs end‚Äîhis goddamn smile just never left his face.\n\n‚ÄúWhere am I?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhat is this part of town, this place? What‚Äôs all of this? Who are you?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThis place is hardly ever found by people. The lucky few here live happy lives and are cared for by me. I take care of everything and everyone. I am the master of this place you will call home. The man you met works for me. He is the only one allowed to roam the streets at night. You should have known that we have a curfew here. After 10 pm, no one is ever allowed outside except the Man with the TV. So that means you broke the only rule here,‚Äù the man with the funny suit said.\n\n‚ÄúWhat? What the hell‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I replied. My head spun around, and dizziness took hold of my body. Then, I heard the door lock by itself.\n\n‚ÄúYour unwillingness to follow the rules is infuriating. You will be punished accordingly, but first, you must participate in this auction.  It is of the utmost importance that you do so‚Äù, the devil-man reiterated.\n\n‚ÄúLet me out of here. I want to leave,‚Äù I said. I tried to run for the door but couldn‚Äôt move. \n\n‚ÄúStop resisting. You will not leave here if you continue disobeying what I say!‚Äù the man shouted. His voice deafened me. It felt like he threw broken shards of glass into my ear, making it bleed inside.\n\nHis arms suddenly extended toward me. Monstrous claws replaced his fingernails, and his once pale cancerous skin turned a dark gangrenous hue.\n\nLike tentacles from hell, they grabbed my head and squeezed. I could feel the life flying away from me, and death‚Äôs cold embrace was the only logical outcome. The last thing I saw before my mind went black was his demented grin, but this time a bloody crimson hue painted over his face. The small rivers of blood that came from my eyes made me feel like some stigma in reverse.\n\nI woke up in a glass tank, like a live human exhibit. The man sat behind an old mahogany desk. It smelled like incense, the heavy aroma making me sick to my stomach, even more than I already was. I regained my consciousness but couldn‚Äôt just open my eyes yet. The air reeked of incense, the heavy aroma making me sick to my stomach, even more than I already was.\n\nWelcome to Bizzarro World.\n\nI opened my eyes and saw the man standing behind an old mahogany desk. Black candles adorned the rims of the desk. The man hit the surface of the desk with a wooden hammer.\n\nI screamed and banged against the glass. The man just looked at me with his enormous evil grin. His eyes told me that help wouldn‚Äôt come. \n\nI saw a few empty chairs in front of me. This insanity kept growing like a tumor.\n\n‚ÄúGood evening, ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to this year‚Äôs auction!‚Äù he shouted, standing up.\n\nNow, on the chairs, plastic mannequins appeared out of thin air. Some stood with their arms up, others seemed to worship their master, while I, captive inside my glass prison, watched all the events unfolding before me. \n\n‚ÄúAs you can see, this year‚Äôs lot is this young man right here ‚Äî our newest citizen is up to you to bid as you see fit. Starting at $10000!‚Äù the man shouted.\n\nNothing came from the room.\n\n‚Äú$10001! Going once, going twice, and sold to myself! Hahahaha!‚Äù the man burst out laughing. ‚ÄúWelcome, young man, to your new home!‚Äù\n\nThe glass broke, and millions of tiny pieces hit my face and skin. The bleeding lacerations disfigured me. The man shattered my soul, an empty void now growing inside me. All faded to black. I woke up in a room with cracked walls and giant bugs walking around slowly. For a brief moment, I thought I heard a chainsaw-like noise. The bed was filthy, and water dripped in the mold-infested bathroom. It felt like a countdown to the end of my days. A dying rat convulsed in the corner of the room.\n\nI exited the room and saw that I was in Apartment 23. The building felt deserted as I was the first and last tenant there.  Descending the stairs of this hellish place, I managed to get out outside. A chair and TV guarded the night in the middle of the street. \n\n‚ÄúSit down,‚Äù an ethereal voice instructed me. With no will left to live, I followed the order. I was too afraid not to comply.\n\nThis place sunk its teeth deep inside my heart, and its claws ripped the flesh off my bones. \n\nI stood on the chair, watching the TV in all its static glory. \n\nIt feels good here. Maybe more people will move to this part of town.\n\nIt feels good to be home again. \n\n*Master, I will endure. I am nothing without you. My Master, My Lord, My God.*\n\n[.... . .-.. .--. / -- . -.-.--](https://www.reddit.com/r/PostMortem33/comments/gpnh5h/story_masterpost/)",

        "text": "From as far as I remember, she was always there. She never ages; she never smiles; she never looks away. A constant of about six foot six, and scarf-styled trench coat, ever looming and present. Wherever I go, watching me are hollow eyes set in a perfect porcelain face. I‚Äôve taken to calling her Sarah.\n\nShe was there in the neighbour's yard, sheer heigh towering over white picket fence, idly watching as I played by myself swinging from the tyre on the tree. I didn‚Äôt understand much when I was a kid to be honest, in that I was stupid, so honestly, I was what you would call, unbothered by the whole affair.\n\nMy parents, child behaviourists, thought there was something wrong with me when I didn‚Äôt outgrow my imaginary friend. I suppose my mom found it much more disturbing that instead of a talking moose, I had a 6 foot 6 mother figure. I fail to see how imagining a spectre of bone white vigil could be a subconscious critique on her motherhood, but women eh? \n\nI guess if little David told me he saw Che Guevera as his imaginary friend well past 6, I‚Äôd be a little insecure too though. Mostly pissed at Claire for reading him the entirety of Latin American history when he was in the womb.\n\nI suppose it would be a little off putting for most to have an unknown body, only visible to you, watching over you like a hawk. At least to the few friends and family I tried to explain it to. Even my wife thinks I‚Äôm putting up an incredibly long bit. Perhaps you think she‚Äôs never always there, and you‚Äôd be right to an extent.\n\nShe looms in and she looms out. \n\nEvery examination season she‚Äôs right behind me, so I would feel her breathing up against my neck. Unfortunately, the SAT does not accommodate for ‚Äòanxiety caused by an imaginary lady standing right behind me‚Äô. Real non-inclusive of them, honestly. \n\nOther times she maintains more than her recommended social distancing policy. Sometimes out of sight, but never more than around the corner. Something I‚Äôm especially grateful for. Imagine getting it on with your girl while having a dynamic version of the Virgin Mary watching you? You‚Äôre gonna need more than a little blue pill that‚Äôs for sure.\n\nI don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs actively debilitating. I‚Äôve always been good at being alone as a result, because I‚Äôm never really alone. When my mom passed, she was there. Closer than ever, as I listened to my mother‚Äôs final words telling me how she loved me more than anything else in the world.\n\nShe was there as I cried my voice hoarse, begging to a foreigner‚Äôs God, to bring her back. That was when she offered me her hand, and said, in a voice distorted and damned, ‚Äòfor a price.‚Äô\n\nThe only time she was tangible, and the one of two times she‚Äôs ever spoken.\n\nThe next day, my mom was fine. The doctors called it a miracle. 20 years later, and she‚Äôs still kicking. \n\nShe positively loves raising David though. Says he‚Äôs nothing like me growing up, much more handsome. \n\nThey go to the park, and watch the geese. \n\nSarah was looking at my son, as she raised her arm‚Äìimpossibly long‚Äìto point with bone thin fingers directly at him, as she spoke again,\n\n‚ÄúThe price‚Äù",

        "text": " \n\n \n\nI always knew that I was different from the other children in my neighborhood. While they played football and climbed trees, I preferred to stay indoors and play with my dolls. My parents didn't understand my fascination with them and often scolded me for being too girly. But I didn't care. I loved my dolls and cherished each one like they were my own children.\n\nAs I grew older, my love for dolls didn't waver. Rather, it only grew stronger. I began to realize that there was something special about each and every one of them. I would spend hours examining their unique features and imagining the stories behind them. I even started researching the history of dolls and found that they have been around for centuries, serving as important cultural and religious symbols in many societies.\n\nI started collecting dolls from all over the world, each one with their own story and significance. I found solace in their company and felt like I had a purpose in life. As my collection grew, I began to see the beauty in the art of doll-making. I started attending doll-making workshops and learning new techniques to create my own dolls.\n\nHowever, there was a dark side to my obsession with dolls. I had an urge to kill that I couldn't control. It started with small animals like birds and mice, but soon escalated to human beings. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't help myself. The thrill of taking someone's life was addictive, and I craved it more and more each day.\n\nIt was then that I got a job at the local day care. It was the perfect cover for my true intentions. I could be around children all day, without arousing any suspicions. And the best part was, I could add to my doll collection.\n\nEvery time I took a life, I would create a doll in their image. It was my way of immortalizing them and keeping them close to me forever. I would dress them up, talk to them and even sleep with them, feeling their presence all around me.\n\nBut as time passed, my killings became more frequent and more daring. The police were closing in on me, and I knew my days were numbered. But I couldn't stop myself. The urge was too strong, and I was too far gone.\n\nI would watch the children at the day care with a sense of detachment, knowing that they were just pawns in my game. They were innocent, but to me, they were just objects to be used and discarded. I would lure them into the storage room, under the pretense of playing a game or giving them a treat. And then I would strike.\n\nEach time I killed, I felt a sense of satisfaction that was unparalleled. And then I would create a doll in their image, adding it to my growing collection. It was a sick and twisted cycle, but I couldn't help myself.\n\nAs the police closed in on me, I knew that my time was running out. But I didn't care. I had my dolls, and they were all that mattered to me. They were my children, my companions, my everything.\n\nAnd so, as I sit here, surrounded by my dolls, I can hear the sirens in the distance. It won't be long now before they catch me. But I'm not afraid. I know that my dolls will keep me company, even in death. And that's all that matters.\n\nPerhaps one day, someone will find my collection and understand the beauty behind it. Or perhaps not. But to me, it will always be a symbol of my love for dolls and my need to take life.",

        "text": "[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11c68fl/a_new_room_just_appeared_in_my_house_something/) - **Part II**\n\n‚ÄúI suppose I should‚Äôve pulled you aside for this chat five years ago,‚Äù Terrence sighed. ‚ÄúTruth is‚Ä¶ I used to live at your place.‚Äù\n\nThe greying, middle-aged man scooped up his mug of coffee with two unsteady hands. He concealed his pale, fearful face in the steam plume erupting from the drink, as he greedily lapped up the liquid. We were the only early-morning customers at the local caf√©. The shop‚Äôs atmosphere was uncharacteristically still and sombre.\n\n‚ÄúWhy did you never tell me?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve talked in here so many times. Usually, you can‚Äôt stop talking.‚Äù\n\nTerrence sheepishly scratched the nape of his neck, averting my gaze. The non-committal disposition of an often-jolly town resident was filling me with deadening dread ‚Äî I had hoped Terrence would be my saviour. After all, wasn‚Äôt that what the abomination had said? Terrence, save me.\n\n‚ÄúSomething happened that prompted my move away from that house,‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúI had a wife. Molly. She was a deeply disturbed individual, battling demons. I tried to help her with her mental illness, but she was never the same after she tried to‚Ä¶ end things.‚Äù\n\nTerrence paused to dab a solitary tear, trickling down his cheek. ‚ÄúAnd then one day, seven years ago, she left. Vanished without a trace. Nobody‚Äôs seen her since. I pray that she‚Äôs safe out there.‚Äù\n\nI consoled the man whilst he sobbed profusely, and he offered me a meek smile, clutching at a glimmer of his usual jovial self.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for dumping that on you, Ethan,‚Äù He sighed. ‚ÄúNot our usual brand of conversation, eh?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut do you believe what I said?‚Äù I asked.\n\nTerrence frowned. ‚ÄúAbout a ghost? I mean‚Ä¶ Like you, I‚Äôve seen things in my time. Things I couldn‚Äôt explain.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd do you think the woman I saw could have been‚Ä¶‚Äù I trailed off.\n\nThe man‚Äôs eyes widened with terror, as he finally appeared to comprehend my implication. A hypothesis which seemed to devastate Terrence Brown to his very core.\n\n‚ÄúMolly?‚Äù He whispered. ‚ÄúNo, it couldn‚Äôt have been‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShe spoke your name,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúShe begged you to save her.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSave her?‚Äù He gasped. ‚ÄúDo you‚Ä¶ think I still can?‚Äù\n\nI hung my head dejectedly. ‚ÄúTerrence, I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs still alive. What I saw in that room‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt human.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Terrence mumbled. ‚ÄúSometimes, I‚Ä¶ I think I see her. Hear her.‚Äù\n\nAs if to affirm the man‚Äôs point, a rattling noise jolted me upright. The sound, like an old door wrestling with its hinges, came from a distant spot. My eyes were immediately drawn to the road outside the coffee shop. And there, standing on the pavement, was a haunting apparition ‚Äî the woman from the chest of drawers. Molly.\n\nI soundlessly screamed as the woman raised a finger to her lips, warning me to not utter a sound. I complied, though my mouth was agape as the dead woman took sinister strides towards a nearby bus stop, vanishing behind it and not re-emerging.\n\n‚ÄúEthan? Are you okay?‚Äù\n\nTerrence wrenched me from my silent nightmare, and I saw recognition in his eyes. I think he knew what I‚Äôd seen. I‚Äôm sure the age-old words played on his lips that it looked as if I‚Äôd seen a ghost.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I eventually lied. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôd better head back home.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou do look a little pale,‚Äù Terrence said, nodding. ‚ÄúGive my best to Kate, won‚Äôt you?‚Äù\n\nI smiled and promised to do just that. After shaking the man‚Äôs hand, I strolled home, thinking back on the conversation. There was so much to unpack, and my frazzled brain wouldn‚Äôt complete the mental jigsaw until later.\n\nWhen I arrived home, I was frustrated to see another car on the driveway. The BMW with tinted windows could only belong to one person ‚Äî Ryan. And when I stormed into my house, that horrifying prospect was confirmed.\n\n‚ÄúDad‚Ä¶‚Äù Kate quietly said, as I found them talking in the kitchen. ‚ÄúThis is-‚Äù\n\n‚Äú- Ryan,‚Äù I coldly finished.\n\nThe young man gulped, extending a shaky hand for me to receive. I unleashed a wicked little grin and pointedly looked at the hand, keeping my own firmly by my side. Then I moved onwards, changing the conversation.\n\n‚ÄúKate, can we talk about the room?‚Äù I asked.\n\n‚ÄúSure,‚Äù She replied. ‚ÄúBut we can do it here. I‚Äôve just filled in Ryan on what happened the day before yesterday.‚Äù\n\nI squinted disbelievingly. ‚ÄúYou told him‚Ä¶ everything?‚Äù\n\nShe nodded, and I moved my attention to Ryan, who had finally returned his outstretched hand to his side, wearing a wounded expression on his boyish face.\n\n‚ÄúAnd what do you think, Ryan?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúA lot of superstitious nonsense?‚Äù\n\nRyan vehemently shook his head. ‚ÄúNo, sir. I believe in that stuff, and Kate‚Äôs no liar.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd we all aspire to be so honest, don‚Äôt we?‚Äù I asked.\n\nRyan gulped, and Kate shot me a look that told me, without need for words, to drop it. Not wanting to upset my daughter, I groaned and begrudgingly obliged. Silently, the three of us walked up to the upstairs landing and eyed the ominous purple door at the far end.\n\nThis time, I led the way. When I opened the door, finding the room to be much the same as last time, I shuddered at the prospect of reliving those dreadful events again. But I needed answers. I needed to know about the woman, Molly. If Terrence couldn‚Äôt save her, I decided that I could.\n\n‚ÄúThis is really fucking weird,‚Äù Ryan whispered.\n\nWe scoured the room from top to bottom, but there were no clues. I was partly relieved, especially to see that the door wasn‚Äôt shrinking into the carpet, but the lack of answers was disconcerting. If I couldn‚Äôt save Molly, would her vengeful spirit exact its fury upon me? I trembled at that thought.\n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù Kate asked.\n\nMy daughter was pointing her quivering index finger at a spot on the wooden floor ‚Äî one of the boards was slightly damper than the others and, by the looks of it, looser.\n\n‚ÄúGood find,‚Äù I said.\n\nI knelt on the bedroom floor, inspecting the suspect plank of wood. It required little exertion to prize the board free from the floor. I exhaled deeply upon finding nothing but an empty black hole beneath it. I‚Äôd feared that I would find a body part of something unimaginably macabre.\n\n‚ÄúWell?‚Äù Kate pressed.\n\nI smiled. ‚ÄúNothing to worry about. It‚Äôs just-‚Äù\n\nI yelled in horror as a lifeless hand emerged from the darkness, stretching its bony, emaciated extremities towards me. Before my daughter or Ryan could leap towards to save me, the fingers had seized a handful of my T-shirt. It tugged, and I inexplicably tumbled into the tiny chasm beneath the floorboard ‚Äî my body flattened, squeezing through the narrow slit.\n\nAfter a few terrifying moments of screeching in an endless void of blackness, I eventually returned to the mortal realm. Cold, unforgiving concrete smashed into my face, torso, and knees. I cried, nursing numerous aching joints and potential bone fractures.\n\nRolling onto my back, I absorbed my surroundings. Boundlessly bewildered, I failed to grasp how I had fallen through to the basement ‚Äî the basement I didn‚Äôt even know my house had. Rickety stairs led up to a doorway filled with bricks. The basement had been sealed off from the outside world, and I would soon discover why.\n\nOn the wall behind me was something that filled me with fright unlike any that can be put into words. I was looking at a purple door. The same purple door as the one on the upstairs landing, and yet this one was much more tangible. I couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on why that was so. But when I placed my hand in the dusty, long-neglected brass handle, I was horrified to see that it did not open onto the room I had come to know.\n\nAnd then I realised that wasn‚Äôt true. No bed, no chest of drawers, but I recognised the oak wardrobe ‚Äî it was rotten and missing its doors, but it was unmistakable. And I finally understood that the bedroom window had always been a basement window, which explained why it had been at such a low level. It was the same room, but I was looking at it in the present day. The real purple room. Not the apparition that came and went as it pleased. I realised I had been stumbling into a ghostly flashback on the upstairs landing. Molly‚Äôs ghostly flashback.\n\n‚ÄúWhat the fuck happened down here?‚Äù I whispered.\n\nAnd that was when I saw something in the present-day room which differed from the magical one. There was writing on the wall. Scratched into the cream colouring, presumably with a sharp nail, were the following words:\n\nMy name is Molly Brown. I‚Äôm going to die down here. Terrence locked me in this room.\n\nMy heart sunk, and everything suddenly made sense. Terrence‚Äôs evasiveness. His wife had died down here, the captive of a sadistic tormenter, and her husband had sold the town a twisted tale of an unstable woman who ran away. But Molly had finally shown me the truth.\n\n‚ÄúRyan!‚Äù Kate screamed.\n\nI turned to the wardrobe, the source of my daughter‚Äôs wail, and saw my only exit from that dungeon prison. A supernatural gateway from the wardrobe of the real basement room to the false one on the upstairs landing. Kate saw me through the wardrobe and gasped.\n\n‚ÄúDad?‚Äù She cried.\n\nWhilst she sobbed ‚Äî blood staining her skin and clothes ‚Äî in the corner of the room on the other side of the wardrobe, like a demonic version of Narnia, Terrence had pinned Ryan to the floor. He was twisting a knife into the boy‚Äôs shoulder, and the kid was screaming in agony.\n\nWithout a moment‚Äôs thought, I flew through the wardrobe doorway and entered the magical upstairs room. My body collided with Terrence, and I realised that I had no idea how to fight. I‚Äôd never laid a hand on anybody. As we both sprawled across the floor, the snarling man, who was no longer Brown the Clown, loomed above me.\n\n‚ÄúYou three just had to go looking for answers, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù He spat. ‚ÄúWell, the mystery has been solved. And now you can join Molly, the ungrateful little bitch, beneath the very foundations of this house.‚Äù\n\nRyan crawled on his back towards Kate, and the two of them ‚Äî coated in blood ‚Äî embraced in the corner of the room. My only focus was to keep Terrence away from them. I had to keep his attention fixed on me. I had to stop him. And that was when I saw the key to ending that night of horror.\n\nThrough the wardrobe gateway, back in the real basement room, that ghoulish contortionist crawled through the cracks between the floorboards, slinking into a painfully paper-thin form. When she had fully emerged, she bulged into the same corpse-like entity I had seen two days prior. She stood in the basement, waiting with open arms.\n\nI finally understood.\n\nScrambling to my feet, I rugby-tackled Terrence towards the wardrobe. When I took a step back, my heart dropped ‚Äî he had braces himself on either side of the wardrobe, preventing himself from falling through to the basement room. His victorious grin was utterly horrifying.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôll look after Kate when you‚Äôre gone, Ethan,‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúI have a spare room downstairs that I think would be absolutely perfect for her.‚Äù\n\nAs the malevolent man lunged towards me, I braced for death. But death didn‚Äôt come. Terrence looked down, as did I, and we both saw two ghostly-white phantom limbs wrapped around his waist. His eyes grew teary and feverishly fearful.\n\n‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù He sobbed.\n\n‚ÄúYour turn,‚Äù Molly eerily whispered.\n\nThe undead apparition hoisted Terrence backwards, and he screeched in horror as he disappeared into the basement room. The doors of the wardrobe slammed shut behind him, sealing him in that bricked-up coffin forever.\n\nI helped Ryan and Kate out of the upstairs purple room, and the door vanished as soon as we were back on the landing. After ambulances had been called and the day finally wound to a horrifying close, I started to document my events in this closing post.\n\nI keep thinking about things I missed. Signs that Terrence was an abhorrent monster who meant my family harm.\n\nGive my best to Kate, won‚Äôt you?\n\nI never mentioned my daughter was visiting ‚Äî I don‚Äôt think I even mentioned her name. Anyway, he‚Äôs rotting away in the basement now. He won‚Äôt last long down there. The basement doorway is concealed by brickwork and plaster in the ground-floor lobby. Nobody will ever find him.\n\nI suppose Molly will keep him company.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

        "text": "The person in the mirror is a stranger. These hands, this face, they are not mine. I find them familiar, like an echo of a child's song that I have forgotten the words to.\n\nI woke up in a small white room. The wall to my right is a window. The wall to my front is a mirror. The length of the room is twice my height. The width of the room is the width of my arms outstretched.\n\nThere is no door.\n\nWatching the stranger in the mirror, I hold his gaze. His eyes are blue. A vibrant blue like sea glass.\n\nThe eyes I remember are not the blue of sea glass. I cannot recall the color of my true eyes, but I know they are not blue. These blue eyes are foreign to me.\n\nI touch his face. I feel the bridge of his crooked but upturned nose. My fingertips roam over the high flat cheekbones. The chin juts out, but the teeth are aligned. It is a handsome face, but it is not mine.\n\nThe stranger's hair is long and brown with flecks of gray at the temple. I run my finger through the hair. The hair feels coarse and thick, and in the mirror, I cannot see the scalp. My true hair did not feel like this.\n\nA memory kindles in empty spaces of my mind. I remember clumps of hair between my fingers. I remember anxiety, sadness, and sickness.\n\nThe clothes on his body are loose white cotton. Not pajamas but a linen Henley and pants.\n\nHis feet are bare, and his toes are straight.\n\nI look down at the feet. The feet seem so far away. Is the stranger taller than me?\n\nThis stranger looks like he should be running along a beach with wild horses.\n\nI turn away from the mirror. I turn away from the stranger in that mirror.\n\nThis room has no doors.\n\nThe walls are soft rubber, like a playground floor. I run my hand across the spongy plane, looking for marks or bumps indicating a hidden door. I trace each wall but find nothing.\n\nTurning to the window, I knock on the glass. The ground is so far away. The room I am in is approximately ten stories above the ground. The window overlooks a meadow of swaying tall grass. I consider breaking the window. If I shatter the window, could I survive the fall?\n\nThe sleeping pad is the only piece of furniture in the room. It is made of thick foam, comfortable dense foam.\n\nMy thoughts seem stilted. I may be in shock. I am tired. I should sleep.\n\nI lie on the foam pad and breathe deeply. This cannot be real, I tell myself. I will sleep. I will wake up from this dream and not see a stranger in the mirror.\n\nThat is not what happens, no matter how hard I wish it.\n\nI do not sleep, and I do not return to my body. I am stuck in a room without doors in a stranger's body. Standing, I take a step and try to pace the tiny space.\n\nThe room is too tiny to pace in. I end up spinning in place. I turn myself faster and faster and faster until I fall against the mirror wall.\n\nWhat if I need to pee? A thought strikes me, and I peek into my pants. That is different too. Bigger.\n\nI laugh at the ridiculousness of it all, but the laughter is fuller and deeper, and I clasp my hands over my mouth.\n\nSomething inside of me is breaking. The scream I am holding inside is trying to tear its way out of my chest. I pound on the walls. I call for help until my unfamiliar voice cracks and fails. Finally, I scream until my voice is completely gone.\n\nEverything is wrong. I am not me.\n\nWho am I? What is my name? Where is my body? My name and my shape in this world are gone.\n\nI wreck my already broken voice and scream until I pass out.\n\nIt is the night when I wake. The meadow is dark.\n\nI lift my eyes to the heavens. The constellation Orion is continuing his hunt high in the night sky. The moon is a sliver, and beyond the moon, I can see the jagged tear in the stars.\n\nI can see the galaxy. The purples and blues are only visible in the absence of artificial light. I begin to weep, but I don't understand why.\n\nThe constellations creep by, and I am content at this moment. I sleep.\n\nDays pass, and my only diversion is the window. I cannot bear to see the stranger, so I keep my back to the mirror.\n\nI have not felt hungry or needed to use the toilet. The lack of bodily functions is an oddity that I'm confused about and thankful for.\n\nMy mind is foggy, broken in some way. Flashes of insight are followed by confusion. Not much of me remains. Glimpses of a life once lived are cherished and held onto as tightly as possible.\n\nI do not remember being religious, but I think I am dead and in some sort of purgatory. How did my life measure up? Am I being judged?\n\nWatching the unending meadow is my primary diversion during the day. Eddies of wind swirl the tall grass and create enthralling geometric patterns. I watch until it is night, and then I watch the stars.\n\nI sleep for days.\n\nI wake again. It is night.\n\nThe wall is gone.\n\nThe small wall opposite the mirror is gone. The entire wall has swung open, exposing a massive room beyond.\n\nThis room is large, dim, and white. Cautiously I enter. I see many doors to many cells. A flat wooden bench stands in the center of the room, and a large canvas duffle rests on it.\n\nI pull on the doors to the unopened cells. Are others trapped? Why have I been released?\n\nI examine the duffle. Inside the duffle is a black shirt, gray khakis, a pair of black socks, running shoes, a wallet with a class F license with my photo and the name Astor Vang, a large sum of money, and a card that reads \"This is all I can give you. Hurry!\"\n\nI change into the clothes and stuff the white Henley and pants into the duffle. As I zip up the duffle, a second door opens. Hastily I heft the duffle and step through the door into‚Ä¶ daylight.\n\nThe sudden change from night to day is surprising. I turn to the door. There is only a wall. A tall gray wall. I am in a city.\n\nWhere is the meadow? Where are the night sky and the stars?\n\nThis is too much. I twirl in place as I try to see everything. It is all a blur, and I lean against the wall, my breaths quick and shallow.\n\nI hold my head in my hands and try to calm myself.\n\nA prominent metal arch peaks between the tall buildings. I have been here before. I know this city.\n\nStanding, I take a deep calming breath and walk away from the arch.\n\nI walk for days and nights. I walk until I can see the stars and the purple and blues of the galaxy again.",

        "text": "Have you heard of the game \"Bitlife\"?\n\nIt's a text-based game that you download on your phone, that lets you make choices and develop your 'bitlife' by aging them up. I found it while looking for a game to occupy myself during a 6-hour flight, and against all odds, I got hooked to it.\n\nI‚Äôm not much of a ‚Äògamer‚Äô, unless you count Candy Crush, but for some reason this game really drew me in. All the options and unique scenarios just kept me coming back for more.\n\nMy first ‚ÄòBitlife‚Äô died as a mid-level salesman. The next was a famous musician. The one after was a notorious serial killer. Every new ‚Äòbitlife‚Äô was different, and every one more interesting than the next.\n\nOne day, I was lying on my couch, sipping on a vitamin water as my latest bitlife lived out his final years. He was a very successful CEO, married to his partner for 40 years, and was the loving adopted father of two boys.\n\nThe black ‚Äòdeath‚Äô screen popped up, as I aged him up one last time.\n\n‚ÄúGary Newell died at the age of 82.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHe passed away peacefully in his sleep.‚Äù\n\nI let out a satisfied sigh. Gary lived a very fulfilling, very successful life. I took another sip of my water, letting the silence of my apartment envelop me for a few moments.\n\nI checked the time. 9:18 p.m. Enough time for me to start a new life.\n\nI clicked the little sperm icon to start again. My phone froze, the screen becoming unresponsive for a few seconds. Frustrated, I locked and unlocked the screen to try to get it to work again.\n\nIt flickered back to life, the app opening again.\n\nI gasped as double-checked the new name.\n\n‚ÄúRita Thatcher‚Äù.\n\nThe exact same name as me!\n\nI let out a laugh, trying to imagine what the chances are that the random name would be mine!\n\nI decided I was gonna give little Rita the best life possible. Make her a CEO, or a famous painter. Maybe even a movie star.\n\nFeeling excited, I took a look at the information screen.\n\n‚ÄúI was born a female in Glasgow, UK.‚Äù\n\nMy eyes went wide as I double-checked the location. I was born in Glasgow.\n\nMy excitement slowly faded to a dull sense of dread as I continued to read.\n\n‚ÄúBorn 28 November.‚Äù Same day as me.\n\nThe feeling of dread grew as I read the names of the parents.\n\n\"David Thatcher, writer. (age 29)\" \"Willow Thatcher, police officer. (age 27)\"\n\nThose are my parents names.\n\nMy dad was a writer, and my mom was a police officer back in those days. I quickly did the math, and the ages also matched.\n\nWith shaking hands, I clicked \"Age up\".\n\n\"Age: 1 year. My mother and father had a baby boy named Jenson.\"\n\nMy blood turned to ice as I read the text again.\n\n\"No way.\" I said to myself over and over, unable to believe that this is really happening. My stomach wrenched itself into knots as I thought of my poor, sweet brother.\n\nI clicked \"Age up.\"\n\nNothing showed up for Age 2 and 3. With each blank screen, the feeling of dread that sat inside me eased up just a little. I tried to imagine what the odds of all this being a coincidence was. Probably impossibly low.\n\nI clicked \"Age up.\"\n\n\"Age 4: your parents want to buy you and your brother a pet spaniel named Daphne!\"\n\nI let out a shriek as I dropped my phone and scrambled to the other side of the couch. I fell off the edge, my butt hitting the cold, tiled floor.\n\nI sat there for a bit, curled up and taking deep breaths. I remembered Daphne's sweet, brown eyes and golden coat. My parents got her for Jenson and I when I was four. She was my sweet angel, my best friend for five years.\n\nI sat on the floor for a few seconds more, as the weight in my stomach eased up enough for me to get up. I went to the kitchen, grabbed a glass from the cabinet and poured myself some water.\n\nI leaned against the counter, taking slow sips as the feeling of dread faded little by little.\n\nI placed the empty glass in the sink and turned the hot water on, grabbing the sponge and dish soap as the water heated up. Still in a daze, I cleaned the glass, rinsing off the suds and placing it on the rack to dry.\n\nI think I'm just tired. Overworked and delusional from working a double shift. I'll just turn off the game and go to bed.\n\nI jumped as a 'Ping!' sounded from the lounge. It's my phone, letting me know I had a message.\n\nI made my way to the lounge, sitting back on the couch as I picked up my phone and glanced at its screen.\n\nBitlife was still open, it's text waiting patiently for me as I swiped down and checked the notification.\n\nIt was from Bitlife. \"Don't leave just yet!\" it said.\n\n\"You must be losing your mind, Rita.\" I told myself, as I clicked \"Age up\", bracing myself for whatever came next.\n\n\"It's just a game.\" I tried to tell myself. It didn't help.\n\n\"Age: 6 years. My dad is now addicted to alcohol.\"\n\nI tried to lock the phone, my hands fumbling over the button over and over in a panic. The screen refused to lock, the text becoming blurry as I started to cry.\n\nIn frustration, I threw my phone across the room. It gave a loud Crack! as it bounced against the wall, it's screen ripping off and hanging from the main body.\n\nThe phone started pinging. Slowly at first, but picking up speed until it became a torrent of noise.\n\nMechanically, I made my way over to it, delicately picking up the screen as its cabling snapped off and left the main body behind.\n\nImpossibly, notifications flooded across the top of its lit screen. \"Don't leave just yet, Rita!\" it said, all from Bitlife. I watched as they flickered by.\n\nSuddenly they stopped, one final message popping up from the Text app.\n\nIt was from my dad.\n\n\"Keep playing, Rita.\"\n\nI clicked \"Age up.\"\n\n\"Age: 7 years. My brother Jenson died at the age of 6.\"\n\nMy eyesight became more blurry as tears flowed down my face.\n\n\"He died in a car crash.\"\n\nMy dad was driving that car. He picked him up from nursery school and was on his way to pick me up from my school when it happened. It was a head-on collision.\n\nThe police found my dad over the limit, and halfway across the other lane.\n\nAnother notification, this time from my mom.\n\n\"Keep going!\"\n\nNumbly, I clicked \"Age up.\"\n\n\"Age: 8 years. My mom died at the age of 35.\"\n\nThe phones speakers came to life from the other side of the room, giving me a start. Two voices flooded out of it.\n\nIt's been years, but I recognized my parent's voices.\n\nIt started out hushed, both of them whispering to each other so as to not wake little Rita. Soon the voices grew louder and louder, filling the living room as they screamed angrily at each other.\n\nI cupped my ears, trying to drown out the sounds. It grew louder, the noise filling the room until I screamed, trying to drown them out.\n\nSuddenly it stopped. A door slammed and the sound of heavy footsteps marched away.\n\nI heard someone open a kitchen drawer, the utensils clanging together inside it as someone rifled around.\n\nThey pulled something out, slamming the drawer shut as they made their way back to where they came.\n\nI heard another 'Ping!' come from my phone.\n\n\"She was stabbed by my father during an argument.\"\n\nThe screaming turned my blood to ice.\n\nIt started off loud and shrill, the sound reverberating throughout the house. It started becoming hoarse and choked, before cutting off to a gargling silence.\n\nI cupped my hands over my ears, dropping the screen as I curled into a ball.\n\nI began screaming, telling it to stop as the sounds of my dad's labored breathing joined the sounds of his knife.\n\nSuddenly it cut off with another 'Ping!'. As my vision returned, I looked up at the screen.\n\n\"Keep playing, Rita.\"\n\nI clicked \"Age up.\"\n\n\"Age: 9 years. My father committed suicide in prison at age 38. I've been sent to an orphanage.\"\n\nI clicked again. \"Age up.\"\n\n\"Age: 13 years. I was adopted by Adam Whiteley and Sarah Whiteley.\"\n\nAnother 'Ping!'.\n\n\"Almost there.\"\n\n\"Age: 15 years. My adoptive father hit me for not finishing dinner.\"\n\n'Ping!'. \"Age up.\"\n\n\"Age: 18 years. I ran away from home.\"\n\n\"Age: 19 years. I got a job as a barista.\"\n\n\"\\*Age: 20 years.\"\n\n\"22 years\"\n\n25.\n\nMy breathing is shallow, my head is fuzzy and my hands are shaking as I stare at the screen.\n\n25 years.\n\nI turned 26 today.\n\nI jumped as I heard another 'Ping!'.\n\n\"Almost there.\"\n\nI clicked \"Age up.\"\n\nThe black 'Death' screen popped up. \"Rita Thatcher died at the age of 26\"\n\nI screamed as I heard my front door creak open.\n\n\"She was killed while at home.\"",

        "text": "My older sister and I used to venture through the forest behind our house at least 4 times a week. She loved to build dens and shelters, whilst I preferred climbing and manoeuvring my way up trees. Both of us shared adoration for exploration. It was the perfect hobby for us to bond, and the memories I collected there growing up remain my fondest, even well into adulthood. The family house is now just my own. My sister used to still visit frequently, though, and we would wander through the woods together if the weather was kind enough.\n\nLast year, everything changed when my sister stopped visiting. She doesn't talk much to anyone anymore - She's so reclusive. She broke up with her girlfriend and forced her to move out. It means that she lives alone now, and trying to talk to her is difficult if not impossible at times. In the past year, I have spoken to her 4 or 5 times, and it has always been the same. She will immediately say,\n\n\"You are not allowed to wander the woods. Not anymore.\"\n\nBut whenever I asked her why or tried to get her to explain further, she would just stare at me. She wouldn't say a word. The last time I saw her, she even got angry at me, insisting I already know why. She called me delusional for not understanding. But telling me I'm not allowed to enter the forest behind my own house? I could not understand why she thought she had that authority, or why she would even want to command me about that in the first place.\n\nI never really entered the woods without her anyway, so it was never an issue. Until last week. I missed having a sister. I missed the adventures we used to go on. I wanted to go and re-live some memories, even if it meant going in alone. So I did exactly what she told me not to do - I wandered the woods. I live in a small town; passing by someone on the streets is rare enough, and it only becomes rarer in the forest. You can almost guarantee that you will be alone every time you walk through it. I wish that were true this time, too. I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw it.\n\nI don't know how long I froze there. What felt like minutes was probably closer to seconds. If it had truly been minutes, I think I wouldn't be here to even tell this story. No, it must have been the shortest amount of time before I ran. Running away is a basic human instinct. I'm lucky they didn't notice my eyes, or they'd be out of my skull. I'm even luckier that I didn't accidentally think about them too hard. We all know what would happen if I did.\n\nOnce I got home, I locked all the doors and windows, and hid in the basement - The only room with no view outside. It's the only way I could ensure my safety. I stayed in there with my eyes closed for exactly 17 minutes, just to be sure that they would not take them. Once I opened my eyes again, making sure not to look up for too long, I phoned my friend and told him about this encounter. I tried my very best to explain it to him, but he just kept interrupting me and asking me to continue. Whenever I try to describe the events that occurred, he cannot hear me.\n\nEventually, he hung up and drove to my home. He smashed a window to get in after realising I wasn't going to let him in. As long as I don't listen to the wind coming in through the shattered pane, I should be okay. He found me in the basement and tried to console me. I tried to describe the events again. He could not hear.\n\nMaybe I'm going insane, and keeping my mouth closed when I think I'm talking.\n\nMaybe his brain can't comprehend such horrors, and won't process what I'm saying.\n\nMaybe they don't like to be talked about.\n\nWhatever the reason, I just know that I cannot share this traumatic day with anybody.\n\nMy friend went upstairs to get me a glass of water. He must have listened to the wind, because he never came back down.\n\nI've called other friends and family, but none of them can hear what I have to say. I've texted people, yet nobody replies. I have written physical letters, only for people to ask me why I have mailed them a blank piece of paper. I do not know how to convey what I saw, and I do not know how to forget it myself. I just want to forget it. I haven't slept in days.\n\nI still remember them so vividly, with their .\n\nThe way they would .\n\nThe noise they made when .\n\nI think they're coming for somebody else next. I think they're coming for .\n\n[===](https://www.reddit.com/r/BriteWrites)",

        "text": "Ever since June of 2022, I had been having these terrifying nightmares. I would be in this house, running from something... Someone... And as soon as I'd turn around to look, they were gone. These nightmares keep waking me up, sweaty and as though my breath has been taken out of me. It feels as though I was actually running, with my lungs burning and my legs aching. Tonight was different. \n\nI was having the same nightmare, only this time I actually saw the monster. A tall, shadowy creature with very long arms and legs. Where it's eyes would be, were bright red eyes that were glowing and pierced through your soul. And it wasn't running. It was... Crawling. The creatures eyes looked like they became more enraged as it let out a shattering screech. I woke up sweating, and heaved in a huge breath of air. I adjusted my eyes and stared at the ceiling, and realized I had to use to bathroom. I went to get up, and was held down to the bed. I was spread out and unable to move at all. I couldn't speak or scream. \n\nThat was when I saw him, standing in front of my door. My eyes grew wide as I tried to yell out for help, but all that came out was a weak, pitiful cry. The creature moved closer to my and slowly lowered one of his scrawny fingers down to my chest. A pain surged through me, and I was finally able to sit up. I frantically looked around, but the creature was gone. I slowly got up and peeked out my door, looking for any sign he had been here. As I made my way towards the bathroom, I realized any sign he had been here was gone. \n\nI used the bathroom and slowly made my way back into bed. I drifted to sleep, and actually had a normal dream for once. After waking up, I checked my reflection in the mirror. It was then I noticed the dark spot on my chest, with black lines almost like veins spreading out from it. As I looked in the mirror, my eyes began to glow a dull red. I saw him in his world. He came to mine to mark me. \n\nAnd now he wants me to stay in his world. \n\nPanicking, I immediately grabbed my laptop and tried looking up what this creature could be. I tried to figure out why he would appear to me, how he could, and what he was to no avail. I tried to talk to my friends, but they all think that I'm losing my mind. \n\n\nI don't know what to do. Is there anything I can do‚Ä¶? I don't think I can escape. I feel as though it's better just to accept that he will always be there, trying to capture me. He's never going to let me go, now that I've seen what he is. He will always be haunting me, until I come back to his nightmare he's created.",

It didn‚Äôt display my address nor a return address. ‚ÄòHuh, weird?‚Äô I thought to myself, ‚Äòmust be from one of my neighbours‚Äô.

A phone number was provided to call to receive more information. \n\nMy initial reaction was to throw away the letter; it wasn‚Äôt uncommon to receive spam mail that ended up being a scam or something along those lines of: ‚Äúcome on this free trip, once purchasing this overpriced/unnecessary item!!!‚Äù. However, something intrigued me to look into it further. A quick google search yielded no results. I decided to call my girlfriend who had had a baby a few months prior to myself, to see if she had received something similar. ‚ÄúYeah, I got the same letter! Weird there was no address, but I called the number and it sounds legit‚Äù Jen said, ‚ÄúLittle Luke and I plan to attend, because if you‚Äôre as tired as I am, getting away somewhere sounds amazing. Even if it‚Äôs with the baby!‚Äù. I told her I would think about it and get back to her, she was right though, getting away from home for a bit would be nice. Although I love Jasper, getting out of this house would be a good change of scenery. \n\nWhen my husband returned home from work, I showed him the letter. He looked over it with skepticism, but seeing how tired I was from taking care of Jasper, he softened a little. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre tired hun, but this letter is just a little sketchy‚Äù Oliver stated, ‚ÄúI can take you on a trip with the baby in a few months! Just give me time to save‚Äù.  Oliver wasn‚Äôt wrong that the letter came at random, but I pushed harder, ‚ÄúJen called the number and she said it sounds legit! Please Oliver, I‚Äôve thought this over all day and I‚Äôd really like to attend. It would be nice to be in a place where people understand the great, yet overwhelming experience of becoming a new mom‚Äù I pleaded. Oliver looked hard over the letter again, and with a sigh told me to call the number. \n\nThe next day I called, and Jen was right, it did sound legitimate. No purchase necessary. I provided my address and they would send the plane tickets in the mail in two weeks time, and we would fly out two days after. A private island off the coast of Mexico owned by the company, would be our destination; I could hardly wait and began packing that night. \n\nTwo weeks dragged on before I received the plane tickets. Jen and I had gone shopping to purchase some new outfits for ourself and babe. ‚ÄúMexico, I am SO excited‚Äù exclaimed Jen. I agreed with her, I had never been to Mexico before and felt this was a much deserved reward for carrying my little munchkin for nine months. Jen and I carpooled to the airport two days later; a sea of moms and babies met us with a deafening roar. Wow, they really wanted to fill this plane, I thought. While Jen and I waited for the flight, we met a few other mom‚Äôs and began to socialize. \n\nOnce we boarded our flight, a woman in a light blue pant suit greeted us at the front of the plane, ‚ÄúWelcome new moms, and thank you for the sacrifices you have made to become a Mother. I am Denaida, and will be hosting this trip on behalf of FetaTech. Please, if you have any questions or concerns, don‚Äôt hesitate to come talk to me‚Äù. The plane took off, while Jen and I chatted away about what we would do on our trip. ‚ÄúWhen I phoned, they said they had a daycare so we could spend some time away‚Äù Jen said ‚ÄúWe are definitely having drinks if that‚Äôs the case‚Äù. I laughed, it had been so long since I had had any alcohol. \n\nThe flight went by quicker than anticipated and we finally arrived at our destination. We were greeted right off the plane with a line of staff all dressed in light blue; each helped us to unload our babies and without hesitation began wheeling them towards the resort. ‚ÄúUhm, what are you doing?‚Äù I said to one of the staff rolling Jasper away. ‚ÄúWe take the babies to your room, so you can grab your luggage‚Äù they exclaimed. ‚ÄúOh‚Äù is all I managed to get out. \n\nThe resort rooms were quaint but perfect. Once settled, Jen and I put the babies down for a nap and sat down; taking a moment to enjoy the beauty of the island. A knock on the door snapped us out of our trance, and Jen answered. ‚ÄúTwo drinks for two lovely ladies‚Äù as a staff member held two champagne glasses filled with a blue liquid, ‚Äúan island special. Dinner will be served promptly at 7pm‚Äù. Jen grabbed the two glasses and brought one over to me. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to us!‚Äù As we clinked glasses; the drink had a fruity flavour, that went down a little too easy. \n\nDinner time came, as Jen and I prepared our boys to join us. A staff member, Phoebe, saw us carrying Jasper and Luke, ‚Äúoh ladies, tonight is your night off. We have a nursery to put the babies in while you two enjoy your evening. It‚Äôs right this way!‚Äù.  Phoebe led us to a room filled with bassinets, toys, and all the necessities. A group of women in light blue outfits greeted us; all of them appeared tired, with dark bags under their eyes. ‚ÄúThese ladies will take excellent care of your children while you enjoy dinner!‚Äù Exclaimed phoebe, ‚Äúexcuse me a moment, I see some other ladies looking for the nursery‚Äù. Phoebe walked back to the dinner hall to greet them. \n\nOne of the nursery employees approached us, ‚ÄúBella‚Äù she introduced herself. She looked worried, her eyes darting back and forth to the door and back to us. She looked at both Jen and I, and stated one simple word ‚Äúrun‚Äù. Confused by this, I asked her ‚Äúwhat do you mean?‚Äù. Bella began whispering fast in Spanish, before Phoebe entered the room again. ‚ÄúOh Bella, she‚Äôs our newest employee here. English isn‚Äôt her first language! She tries out new words and phrases with all our guests to better her English. Right, Bella?‚Äù Bella looked down at her shoes, and wouldn‚Äôt meet Phoebes gaze. Bella carried both Luke and Jasper away. ‚ÄúCome along ladies, dinner is about to begin!‚Äù. I began feeling unsure about leaving, but Jen quickly reassured me that we are not far away if we need to see the our little ones. This put my mind at ease, and we walked back to the dining hall. \n\nDinner was served in a twelve course style; each plate was decorated beautifully and absolutely delicious. The same island drink was served to us, until the last course. A spectacular orange drink, decorated with flowers and fruit was apart of our last plate. While reaching for her own, Jen knocked my drink all over my lap. ‚ÄúI am so sorry!‚Äù Jen said, as I excused myself back to our room to change. I was stopped at the door by two employees, ‚Äúsorry ma‚Äôam, you cannot leave until you have finished dinner.‚Äù I explained my predicament, and both employees looked at each other, ‚Äúdid you at least get to enjoy the last drink?‚Äù One employee exclaimed. ‚ÄúOh yes, everything was wonderful‚Äù I lied, not wanting to offend them. ‚ÄúOkay, well be quick, we have a special show after dinner for all our guests!‚Äù.\n\nAfter cleaning up, I stopped by the nursery to check in on Jasper. Upon entering the room, I noticed it was empty. Huh, they must have moved the kids elsewhere, I thought. I quickly changed and returned to the dining room. I sat back down beside Jen, ‚ÄúHope I didn‚Äôt miss anything‚Äù I said, but Jen just stared forward, appearing miles away. Too much to drink I guess, ‚ÄúJen? You okay?‚Äù As I placed my hand on her arm. Her skin was cold and clammy to the touch. Jen slowly turned to me ‚ÄúSorry, the person you have spoken to is unavailable‚Äù she said in a monotone voice. ‚ÄúWow Jen, you really can‚Äôt handle your alcohol‚Äù I exclaimed with a slight chuckle. But as I began to peer around the room, I noticed each mom had the same expressionless face. \n\n‚ÄúThank you ladies, for your wonderful sacrifice‚Äù a booming voice said. My head snapped to the center stage, Denaida had begun to address the group. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know how special our project is, and because of your babies, we will finally be able to conduct our research‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome, Denaida‚Äù each mom chimed in unison. The pit in my stomach grew and grew until I couldn‚Äôt sit still anymore; a cold sweat broke out over my entire body and my brain began to scream ‚Äúrun‚Äù. \n\nWhile Denaida rambled on, I planned my escape. I looked around the room for an empty exit, but each door was guarded by an employee in light blue. I continued to scan the room until I saw an open window behind one of the tables of women. I slowly slunk down my chair and began to crawl towards it. As I was about to climb out I looked up and noticed the entire table was looking at me, their faces stretched into a horrified expression. Each woman began to point at me and scream. This drew attention from the employees who began to charge in my direction. I quickly slipped through the window and landed in the sand. I looked behind me and watched as the other employees began to follow me through the window. I ran as fast as I could, the only thing on my mind was little Jasper. \n\nI managed to give the employees following me the slip by hiding in some underbrush along the beach. Once they passed, I snuck around the resort building to find a way back in. As I was exploring, I saw a large white building separate from the resort we were staying in. I could hear the cries of several babies coming from it, and began to run towards it. What if that was Jaspers cry? \n\nAs I walked around the building looking for the entrance, I peered through the building window. Every baby that was brought to the island lay in this large building. People in white lab coats went from baby to baby, injecting them with a similar looking orange liquid that we were served with dinner. I frantically scanned the babies and noticed Jasper near the back. It appeared as though the people in white lab coats had not made it to him yet. \n\nDesperate to get into the building, I looked around for anything that could get me inside. That‚Äôs when I noticed Bella, the original employee who had told me to run. As she walked by the window I lightly tapped on it hoping to get her attention. Her solemn gaze met mine and suddenly she lit up. She pointed to a door near the back of the building and swiftly walked there to meet me. As I approached the door, she opened it a crack. ‚ÄúPlease, Bella, please I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with this island. I just want my baby back‚Äù hot tears began to roll down my cheeks. ‚ÄúBaby name?‚Äù she stated, ‚ÄúJasper‚Äù I sobbed. Bella calmly walked over to where Jasper was laying and began to pick him up. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù another employee in blue demanded. ‚ÄúChange, baby needs to be change‚Äù I heard her say. The other employee watched her sternly before walking off to the other babies. \n\nOnce the other employee was distracted, Bella handed me Jasper, ‚ÄúBoat‚Äù is all she managed to say to me. She pointed over to the pier where a small boat was gently riding the waves. ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù I said, ‚Äúyou have no idea what you have done for me‚Äù. Bella smiled a sad smile before gently closing the door. \n\nI did my best to sneak over to the boat, unseen by the other employees. Large search lights lit up the island in a sterile white glow. Jasper was nuzzled into my chest fast asleep as I lowered myself into the boat. I stepped on something that crinkled beneath my foot and realized it was a set of instructions, it read as follows:\n\n1. Row boat to nearest buoy, about half a kilometre north. \n2. Once at the buoy, light the flare provided and help will come. \n\nI did as instructed and began rowing, Jasper remained asleep the duration of the trip to the buoy. Once there I lit the flare and waited. It felt like an eternity before another boat appeared in the distance, as I wiped my clammy hands on my pants. A young man pulled up beside me, he had a striking resemblance of Bella. I realized quickly this must be her son, as he helped Jasper and I onto the boat. He introduced himself as Sam, and as I had thought, he was Bella‚Äôs youngest son. \n\nAs we made it back to the mainland of Mexico I learned  that Bella had been helping people escape the island for years with help from her son. ‚ÄúEven if she can save just one, that‚Äôs why she stays there. To try to warn and help‚Äù Sam explained. I also learned about FetaTech and their actual intentions with our children. FetaTech was never interested in learning how our sleep cycles were affected by the time change, but rather how to override maternal instinct and control the hosts conscious state. The orange drinks provided had the FetaTech virus-based serum and once ingested, began to act upon its host almost immediately. As the company realized that their product had worked, the next step was to test it out on the mother‚Äôs offspring which happened to still be in their infancy. Through this, they wanted to learn if they could alter the attachment between both mom and baby. ‚ÄúWhat do they gain from this?‚Äù I asked Sam, still confused. ‚ÄúSuper soldiers. They want people who are unattached to the things that mean the most to them. Less attached equals easier to control. In this case, the bond between mother and child is so strong, that if they were able to alter that, it meant controlling and weaponizing the primitive nature of humans‚Äù. \n\nI sat there stunned, unable to comprehend what had just happened. It was nearing dawn, and we had almost made it to the mainland. I watched as Jaspers chest rose and fell as he slept. I had saved my baby and escaped that dreadful place. Sam helped me acquire a plane ticket home, and I thanked him again. I told him to thank Bella as well, she truly saved my family. \n\nOnce we landed back home, I decided to take a taxi home in order to prevent Oliver from having a panic attack as to why I was home after only 2 days spent on vacation. I wanted time to prepare what I had to tell him, and to compose myself after such an experience. \n\nAs the taxi pulled into our driveway, I breathed a sigh of relief. With my hands still shaking, I fumbled with my keys and finally unlocked our front door. Oliver made no reaction to the sound of the door opening and sat on the couch watching TV as I approached him. He often listened to it so loud, I wasn‚Äôt surprised when we didn‚Äôt hear me. ‚ÄúOliver we are home, and we need to discuss something‚Äù I said. Oliver gave me no reaction, ‚ÄúOliver?‚Äù I said again. He slowly turned his head towards me with that same look in his eyes as Jen had at dinner ‚ÄúSorry, the person you have spoken to is unavailable‚Äù. I began backing away in horror as he stared into the abyss. I noticed movement in the kitchen and my head snapped towards the dinner table. Calmly sitting, Denaida‚Äôs smile stretched a little too wide ‚ÄúHello new mom and Jasper, I was hoping you‚Äôd arrive soon‚Äù.",

        "text": "If Bethany hadn't decided to play the stupid game, none of us would have been in this situation in the first place.  \nThat's how simple life was, really.   \nOne decision, just one wrong decision, and everything was changed.   \n\\-  \nIt started out small and insignificant, as most big things do.  \nBethany came home from work in a flurry, dumped her handbag on the coffee table, unwrapped her bright red scarf and excitedly told us all about this new game she'd heard about that day.   \nJonas and I listened half heartedly, more nodding than actual hearing as there was a game playing on TV.   \nWe both were much more interested in keeping score than hearing about some game our roommate had found out about.  \nShe asked us if we were keen to play later on that evening, and without even taking my eyes off the screen, I had nodded, yeah.  \nI really wish I'd been paying more attention.  \n\\-  \nIt was Jonas' turn to cook, which meant I would be heading to the shops later for a little midnight snack.  \nIt wasn't that he couldn't cook, he just wasn't good at it.   \nAnd by the looks of what he was preparing, it would be the same thing as he made last week, and the week before that, and every single week since we had been living together.   \nChicken lasagna.   \nI loved Jonas, he had been my friend for so long, but I was so sick of his food.   \nI never had the heart to tell him, though.   \nSomethings were just better left unsaid.   \n\\-  \nThe game was simple, according to Bethany.  \nShe gathered us into the loungeroom, where she'd moved the couch to the wall, making the loungeroom space so much larger.   \nA bunch of pillows were arranged on the floor, a few wine glasses and a glass decanter were perched atop the coffee table.   \nShe handed us both a wineglass, full of a shimmery red liquid, wine by the look and smell.   \nI shot a glance at Jonas, who was holding the wineglass away from his body in disgust, as if it got to close to him, he would be poisoned.   \nBethany didn't seem to notice, she just hummed along as she slowly savored and sipped her own drink.   \nI suppose she had just somehow forgotten that Jonas was sober 5 years now, he never drank, staying totally free of alcohol.   \nJonas raised his eyebrow to me, and I shrugged kindly back in response.   \nWhen Bethany's back was turned, I swapped my empty glass with Jonas full one, and downed his in one quick gulp.  \nHe thanked me with an appreciative smile.   \n\\-  \nThe game may may have been simple, but it was honestly weird as fuck.   \nFirst, we did some sort of bizarre chant with Bethany leading the way and us repeating the words she spoke, all of us three standing around in a makeshift circle, holding hands.  \nIt really felt like more of a way to summon an actual demon, than play what was meant to be considered a 'fun game', but I knew Bethany hated being the only female in the house, and felt left out of Jonas and I love for football, so I guess I just wanted to accommodate her into feeling comfortable and having fun.. Her terms of fun, anyway!   \nAfter the chanting was done, Bethany sat down on the floor, indicating us to follow her lead.   \nShe held out her hands, and begrudgingly we took them again.   \nJonas and I sat, glancing at each other awkwardly, wondering if this was the game what was the point of it all?   \nWe hadn't asked many questions about this so called game, infact we hadn't asked anything at all, we'd just gone along with whatever Bethany had placed infront of us.  \nFor a moment I considered asking what the hell this was all about, but it hardly seemed to matter at that point.   \nWhat was done, was already done.   \n\\-  \nI broke the silence after a few moments longer. I felt bad for Bethany not fitting in, but this was just getting ridiculous now.  \nGiving alcohol to a recovering addict?  \nMaking us stand around and say nonsensical words over and over?  \nI was tired, and thanks to Jonas mediocre cooking abilities, I was also starving.  \nI was getting irritated. I'd had enough of this game.  \n\"Look, it's been fun and all, but I probably should get down to the shop before it closes. I'm all out of smokes.\"  \nI pulled my hand out of hers, and stood, while Jonas mumbled something about a big day helping his dad tomorrow, he better be getting to bed himself. I heard his bedroom door clicking shut before I even had time to put my jacket on and do it up.   \nBethany didn't seem to mind, she watched and gave us both a sweet smile, and that was that.  \nThe game, whatever it was meant to be, was over.  \n\\-  \nThe fresh air on my face felt like a slap back to reality.  \nI pulled my jacket hood up around my head, struggling to find warmth against the icy cold wind.  \nThe walk to the shop was quick, taking about 10 minutes at best.  \nI usually enjoyed the late night stroll, but I wasn't feeling it tonight, I just wanted to get something greasy to fill my belly, and my smokes and go back to my warm, cozy bed.  \nThe shopkeeper greeted me by name, giving me a friendly wave as I stepped inside the convenience store.  \nI was making my way back to the register, my hands full with extra snacks id picked up along my trawl down the isles, when I heard the shop door chime open again.  \nI waited for the owners friendly hello, but it never came.   \nInstead, there was a cry, a quick and sudden gasp.   \nI paused, feeling my heart hammering in my chest. Something wasn't right.   \nWithout further thought, I dropped my groceries where I was standing and ran towards the front counter.   \nThe owner was cowering down, crying as he stumbled his way through pulling notes out of the cash register and stuffing them into a black backpack.   \nA man with a balaclava stood there watching.  \nI dont know how it happened, I've never been a fighter. I'm not trained in any self defence.   \nIt was over in what felt like a minute, somehow id managed to wrestle the gun off the dude in the balaclava, without even breaking a sweat.   \nI aimed his own gun at him, with a confidence I never knew I possessed.   \n\"If you ever come here again, you won't be walking back out that door. Get out of here, before I call the police.\" inside I felt nauseated, shaky with anxiety but on the outside I was cool, calm, collected. My voice was strong, serious.   \nThe man ran, he did not look back.   \nThe owners sobs were louder now, his gratefulness so apparent. He gathered a bunch of notes to give them to me, but I shook my head. I grabbed a pack of cigarettes off the counter, flashed them at him as if to say that was all the payment I needed.   \n\"Look after yourself.\" I said, and I left.   \n\\-  \nThe walk home was more of a run.   \nI was full of energy, almost buzzing with electricity it felt like.   \nI couldn't wait to get home and tell Jonas about what had happened. I knew it was a crazy story, I could hardly even believe that it had happened and I was the one there,   \nBut Jonas was a good friend, he could tell when I was being truthful and when I wasn't.   \nThe front door was unlocked, but I wasn't surprised. In my haste to get out of the place I'd probably not even bothered to double check I'd locked it. Not that it mattered, apart from what had just transpired with the hold up at the convenience store, our neighborhood was generally pretty safe.  \nI knew Jonas would probably be asleep by then, but I didn't care. I needed to tell him my story, i had literally saved the day, something I'd dreamt of doing since I was a little kid.   \nI mean, who didn't want to be a hero, right?   \n\\-  \nI knocked softly to start with, and then louder.   \nI called out to let him know it was me, incase he thought it was Bethany and he was pretending to be deep asleep as if to ignore her.   \nNo repsonse came.   \nI tried the handle, and it was unlocked.   \nIt felt wrong to let myself in to Jonas room, but my excitement overtook it and I found myself opening the door and stepping inside.   \nI didn't know a human body could bend the way his was. In fact, I didn't actually know it was a human body.. Jonas body, for a moment to begin with.   \nIt was mangled, the only word I can think of to somehow explain the carnage. \n\nI opened my mouth to scream, but managed to stop myself before I made any noise.  \nI stood silent and thought about what I didn't hear, and that was Bethany.  \nWith baited breath I made my way out of Jonas room and down the hallway towards her bedroom.  \nI didn't knock, just turned the handle and let myself in, bracing for the scene I was expecting to see set out infront of me.  \nBut Bethany's bedroom was clean. There was no body, managed or otherwise, on her bed. Or anywhere else in the room, for that matter.  \nI pulled my phone out of my jeans to call the police, tears forming in my eyes, as my reality slowly sunk in.   \nMy best friend was dead. And my other roommate was missing.  \nAs the call dialed, I noticed something on the printer of Bethanys computer desk.  \nA single page, in what appeared to be freshly printed ink. The writing smudged when I touched it, smearing the start of the letter.   \nI began to read.  \n\\-  \n\"Marc, I'm sorry.  \nI guess that's how this letter should start, an apology and an explanation, of sorts.  \nI heard about the game at work, and if you had of just listened when I explained it, you would of understood better what was going to happen.   \nIt wasn't meant to go like this though, it was supposed to be so different.  \nThe game, all that chanting and holding hands, well it was supposed to make our utmost desires come true.   \nI've never told anyone, but I am failing in science and I just wanted to make my dream of being a marine biologist a reality..  \nInstead, and regrettably, I found out that wasn't what my heart truly desired.   \nI'm ashamed and humiliated to admit, I was the one who did that to Jonas, I was the one who.. hurt him. I suppose it turns out you weren't the only one who despised him cooking that awful lasagne every single week.   \nI had to leave, I can't face going to jail, not for something that wasn't in my control.   \nI swear.. It was like I had no idea what I was doing, it all just happened.   \nI hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me, I was really only trying to help when I suggested the game.  \nI wish I knew more about how long this.. Curse or whatever is, will last. But the truth is I don't. I don't know if it's temporary, and we will go back to normal, and be in control of our actions.. I don't know Marc, it may be forever.   \nI'm sorry.   \nI didn't mean for any of this to happen.   \nBethany.   \n\\-  \nThe police are sending a car out and I don't know what's going to happen from here on out.   \nI couldn't form words on the phone, I was too shocked at what I had read, my head was spinning remembering the way Jonas body has been splayed.. Trying to imagine that Bethany was responsible for that.. It was difficult.   \nAnd also, for the fact my utmost desire had always been quite simple - I wanted to be a hero, I wanted to save the day.   \nI hated Bethany for bringing the game to us, and I hated even more that I understood exactly what she meant.  \nSame as me fighting off that would be robber, I had no idea what I was doing, it was just happening, and then it was done.  \nThe worst of it all, and I wish I could change this, I really do.. is that I feel an overpowering sense of protection towards Bethany.   \nPart of me, the logical part, wants her to be punished, as I know she deserves to be.   \nBut I know that I won't be able to make myself tell the police the truth about what happened.   \nAgainst my own will, as if being controlled by something else, I ripped up the letter she left, and flushed all the teeny, tiny pieces of paper down the toilet, crying as I watched evidence against her go down the literal drain.   \nI truly can't imagine her going to jail for something that wasn't technically her fault.   \nShe's so smart, she's going to be a marine biologist one day.  \nI guess my deepest desire is to protect the vulnerable, no matter the cost to myself.   \n\\-  \nThe police sirens are getting closer, I know there's not much time left where I'm a free man.   \nI have already decided to admit to the murder of my friend, Jonas.   \nIt's my duty to be the hero in this situation.  \nIt's also my duty to try and help others, if I can..   \nI want to warn others. Please, don't make the same mistakes as me.   \nIf someone wants to play a game with you, just take the damn time to understand what you're truly getting yourself into..  \nRemember, one mistake could change your life.. Forever. And not for the best, either.   \nAs for me, I'm waiting, and I'm pondering.   \nI wonder if I will like jail, if I will flourish in there.   \nI think there will be a lot of people that will need protecting.   \nMaybe it isn't going to be so bad, after all.",

He grabs it off the receiver.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*His ex-wife Ellen replies. During their conversation a pounding similar to a beating drum is detectable.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ellen:** ‚ÄúHey, Gerard.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúOh, Ellen. Uh, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ellen:**  ‚ÄúAnson wanted me to call to make sure you didn‚Äôt forget to see him, again,‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúWhat? Of course, I‚Äôll see him. I‚Äôve been getting ready. Where do you want to meet?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ellen:**  ‚ÄúThe park is fine. I‚Äôll be there in an hour.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard**: ‚ÄúSee you then.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Upon the call concluding, he opens a bottle of Ibuprofen and takes a pill. The footage cuts to him arriving at Stone Plaza Park. He approaches Ellen who is sitting on a bench and watching Anson play. Gerard gets their attention. Anson, smiling, runs up and hugs him.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Anson:** ‚ÄúI knew you‚Äôd come!‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Gerard hugs him back and ruffles his hair.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt miss seeing you for the world.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*He looks up from him to Ellen. She isn‚Äôt smiling.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúSo, I guess I‚Äôll meet you back here same time on Sunday?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ellen:** ‚ÄúYeah, but I want to talk for a little bit before you leave.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúHuh? Oh, sure. Just let me put Anson in the car first.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*They walk together back to his car. Gerard puts Anson in the back and tells him he‚Äôll be right back.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúWhat did you want to talk about?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ellen:** ‚ÄúI hope the hangover didn‚Äôt hit you too hard this morning,‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Gerard remains silent.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ellen:** ‚ÄúDid you really think I wouldn‚Äôt notice? For god's sake, I could smell you from the entrance.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been trying to do better.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ellen:** ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to try, Gerard. You need to actually do it and I‚Äôm sick of dealing with it and if you don‚Äôt shape up, Anson is going to get tired of it too.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, but these things don‚Äôt just happen overnight. It takes time. Look, I‚Äôve been seeing a professional and now I‚Äôm in the process of weaning myself off the stuff. Eventually, I‚Äôll be off it completely. I promise.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ellen stares at him for a brief moment before replying.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ellen:** ‚ÄúJust remember that trust is a hard thing to earn back.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*She seems to be staring past him so he looks too and sees Anson playing with some action figures. He turns back to Ellen who walks away without saying another word. He sighs and then gets in his car. He smiles at Anson.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúSo, are you ready to have some fun? How is school?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Anson:** ‚ÄúGood! I got ten gold stars!‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúTen? Wow! That‚Äôs a big number. Have you and your mom been doing good?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Anson:** ‚ÄúYeah, but she works a lot.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúI know she does. Once I‚Äôve gotten things back on track I‚Äôll help you both out more. Now, to celebrate you doing so well in school, why don‚Äôt I let you pick where we go?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Anson thinks for a moment and grins.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Anson:** ‚ÄúSix flags!‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúOkay, we‚Äôll go there right after we get something to eat.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Gerard takes Anson to Mcdonald's and gets him a happy meal. After which, they head to Six Flags. There, Anson gets several photos with the mascots and prizes from games. Most notably, a stuffed Bugs Bunny from a mallet game. While their options for rides are limited, they do make the most of it.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Gerard watches Anson get on the kids‚Äô roller coaster. During this, Anson is noticeably less energetic on the ride compared to the other children. In fact, he almost seems to nod off at several points. When he gets off, he walks as if severely disoriented and almost falls, but his dad catches him.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúHey, buddy, are you alright?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Some of the park staff come up to check on them and ask if everything is okay.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúYeah, he‚Äôs probably just tired.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*He picks up Anson and carries him back to his car. He murmurs to him.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Anson:** ‚ÄúI want‚Ä¶Other rides.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúI know. You‚Äôll get to them next time I promise. Besides, the park will be closing soon anyway so why don‚Äôt you have a nap and then we can see a movie? A new one came out last week, right? I think it was called Roger Rabbit. It has Bugs Bunny in it. Do you want to see it with me?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Anson:** ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*He falls asleep. Gerard puts him in the back and straps him in. The footage cuts to them sitting down in the theater to see the movie, Who Framed Roger Rabbit? At first, Anson is excited, seeing all his favorite characters on screen. As it goes on, though, he is again fighting not to fall asleep.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** \"Hey, you'll miss seeing Bugs if you fall asleep. Here, have some of this.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*He offers Anson some Coke and he takes a sip. This gives him a brief energy post. Gerard offers him some popcorn. He eats several handfuls. Time passes and Anson laughs at several points during the movie.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*All appears to be well. Then he groans.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** \"Hey, what's wrong?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Anson:** \"I don't feel‚Ä¶\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*He vomits.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** \"Shit!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*A theater employee comes to check. He apologizes and is told that they'll take care of it. He picks Anson up.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** \"I think that's enough for one day. Let's Get you home.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The footage cuts to him tucking Anson in with his stuffed Bugs Bunny. He exits the bedroom and goes downstairs to call Ellen.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ellen:** ‚ÄúGerard, it‚Äôs after midnight. Why are you calling?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúSorry, I was just kind of concerned about Anson.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ellen replies, sounding more alert.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ellen:** ‚ÄúHow come?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúDid he ever tell you he wasn‚Äôt feeling good before you gave him to me or maybe did he look like he was acting strange?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ellen:** ‚ÄúNo, not that I can remember. Has something been happening with him?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Gerard explains what happened that day.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to take him to the doctor tomorrow. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs just dealing with a bug or something.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ellen:** ‚ÄúOkay, let me know how it goes.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúSure thing.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The footage cuts ahead to the inside of a hospital room where Anson sleeps in a bed, Ellen is also present. During this, there is a thumping noise. A doctor walks in and introduces himself as Wilber Ochoa. The parents introduce themselves as well.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ellen:** ‚ÄúSo, did the scan show anything?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Wilber:** ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to bring this up until we were sure. However, it seems like a pretty clear diagnosis at this point.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Gerard speaks up, sounding as if he‚Äôs straining to keep his voice level.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard**: ‚ÄúTell us why he‚Äôs sick.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The thumping grows louder.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Wilber:** ‚ÄúWe found a tumor in his brain and unfortunately, it‚Äôs malignant, severely malignant.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The thumping stops.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ellen**: ‚ÄúNo, that‚Ä¶That can‚Äôt be.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Wilber:** ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but that‚Äôs what everything seems to be pointing to.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúWhat can we do for him?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Wilber**: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no easy way to say this. I‚Äôve never seen one this bad in my thirty years of working in this field. We can try some treatments. It‚Äôs just that with a severe case, it‚Äôll have to be exceptionally strong, and I‚Äôm not sure if your son could handle it. We can try it, but I can‚Äôt guarantee it‚Äôll be effective.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard**: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll try to take it one step at a time then.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I‚Äôve seen awful things, Yet,  I know this is the kind of thing that makes someone feel especially powerless.  Seeing someone you love suffering and not being able to do anything about it is a horror I do not wish on anyone. God, if it‚Äôs that bad for me just watching the tape, I can only imagine what it was like for them. With tapes such as these, there‚Äôs an atmosphere to them that makes you feel as if you are in the footage with the people shown. In a way, you feel as if you‚Äôve already known them for a while\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat‚Äôs why I find Ludus to be the most dangerous entity we‚Äôve ever come across. It‚Äôs clear that it‚Äôs familiar with the emotional side of humanity and how to manipulate it. What it‚Äôs trying to gain by doing so we still have yet to figure out. Hell, I‚Äôm not sure if it even has a higher purpose beyond sadism.  At least I know what it is, a predator plain and simple, one I intend to eliminate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The tape does something unusual at this point. Instead of going forward in time, it goes backward, showing three events, two of which take place prior to Gerard and Ellen‚Äôs divorce. The first shows him throwing up in their bathroom.  He stumbles out, not seeing Anson running past him to go downstairs.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*In the process, he accidentally knocks him down the steps. Hearing this, Ellen immediately rushes to their son‚Äôs aid as Gerard also runs to him. Ellen screams at Gerard.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ellen:** ‚ÄúWhat the hell is the matter with you?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard**: ‚ÄúI-i‚Äôm sorry! I didn‚Äôt see him!‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ellen**: ‚ÄúMaybe if you cut back on the beers, you would have!‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*She decides to take Anson to the hospital, leaving Gerard behind. He groans.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard**: ‚ÄúFucking hell‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The second event this time has him alone with Anson during his bath. The footage goes in and out of focus. Anson is playing with some toys. Gerard tells him he‚Äôll be right back. He passes out in the hallway and wakes up to Ellen shrieking at him from the bathroom.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ellen:** ‚ÄúGerard, get in here now!‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*He stumbles up and dashes to her where she finds her kneeling above an unconscious Anson, pushing on his chest. Gerard speaks in a shaky voice.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter with him?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ellen:** ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter? You were supposed to be watching him!‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*She continues pushing on his chest. He coughs up water. She cries and scoops him up in a towel.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard**: ‚ÄúEllen, I-‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*She interrupts him, her voice sounding icily calm.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ellen:** ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking him to my parents. I've been meaning to spend a few days out of the house anyway.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúYou mean away from me?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*She leaves without saying anything else. The final event shows them both in court. The judge, a woman by Janice Larsen gives her verdict.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Janice**: ‚ÄúAfter seeing the evidence presented before me, it is this court‚Äôs decision that sole custody of Anson Valdez be granted to Ellen Hill. Mr. Valdez, you will get him two weekends of every month.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*It cuts back to Gerard back in his son‚Äôs room.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúPlease, I can‚Äôt lose him. I can‚Äôt lose the one thing I‚Äôm doing right.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Unknown Voice:** ‚ÄúGerard‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*He looks up. His name is said again. follows the voice to the radio on his kitchen table.  His name comes from it. The voice is later revealed to be Ludus.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Unknown Voice:** ‚ÄúNo, this isn‚Äôt your imagination, Gerard, I can assure you that. Haven‚Äôt you been clean for over a month now? Give yourself some credit.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*He glances around, presumably trying to find an intruder. He grabs a knife.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúLook, I don‚Äôt know who you are or how you‚Äôre doing this, but get the hell out of here before I have to hurt you!‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Unknown Voice**: ‚ÄúThis is no trick. It‚Äôs all real regardless of whether or not you believe it and I come offering you a chance to save your son.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Hearing this, Gerard gave his undivided attention.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Unknown Voice:** ‚ÄúYou can call me Ludus. How I know so much about you is something you do not need to concern yourself with. All you need to know is that I‚Äôm the only chance your son has of living.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúWhat do you want? Money?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** ‚ÄúOh, please, such things are of no value to me. No, what I want from you is to play a game.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúA game? What kind?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** ‚ÄúIt will be one of tolerance. Should you win, your son‚Äôs health is guaranteed. If you lose, well, let‚Äôs just say you won‚Äôt be far behind him. You are free to refuse, however. You can walk away and cherish the time you have with him. Then move on as best as you can.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúLike hell, how do we play?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLudus: ‚ÄúIf you insist. All I‚Äôll need to participate is something shiny.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Gerard holds up his knife.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGerard: ‚ÄúOkay, what now?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ludus doesn‚Äôt reply. He glances at the eyes of his reflection in the blade. They wink. He yells and drops the knife to the floor. A hand seems to reach out from inside the blade. However, it‚Äôs thin and stretched out in a way that‚Äôs similar to old cartoons.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelieve me when I tell you that when we watched this it was like there were spiders crawling down my back. It‚Äôs as if something that was never meant for our world was squeezing its way in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*A second hand follows it. They flail around until grasping the counter and sink. The head squeezes out, looking like Gerard‚Äôs face if it were stretched out. Soon, the rest of the body emerges, being so tall its head touches the ceiling. Gerard, staring up at it, scoots back on the floor.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** ‚ÄúNow then, are you ready to play?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*It offers Gerard a hand up. He refuses to take it and stands on his own.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready when you are.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ludus‚Äôs face stretches into a smile. It reaches down, picking the knife off the floor.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** ‚ÄúThe rules are simple. Whoever gives out first loses and we can‚Äôt leave this room.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Still grinning, takes the blade and stabs it into the palm of its hand. Blood seeps from the wound when it yanks it out. Then it extends the handle to Gerard who is hesitant to take it. He draws in a breath and takes it. Knowing what is expected of him, he raises the blade above his hand and murmur*s.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúGod help me.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*He brings the knife down, stabbing the blade into his palm. He lets out a stifled scream as blood also pours from his wound. Much like its game with Gwen, it seems that those participating are granted the ability to survive otherwise fatal injuries. Gerard twists the knife, freeing it. His breathing is rapid.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your turn to pick what we go through.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Gerard‚Äôs eyes fall on his garbage disposal.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre going to win?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*He flips the switch, causing it to whir.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wipe that smirk off your ugly fucking face.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*He thrusts his hand into the drain. His yells of pain fill the kitchen as blood shoots up from his hand. After about half a minute, he finally pulls his hand free.  What‚Äôs left of it is some meaty knarled stubs.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself to have a pretty strong stomach and yet I wanted to throw up when I saw that. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôve come across some gory shit, but the fact Gerard did that to himself is what makes it so much worse for me and the glee Ludus got from seeing his pain. It‚Äôs the kind of thing that stays with you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Gerard collapses to the floor, out of breath.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúBeat that‚Ä¶Mother fucker.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus‚Äôs expression is neutral. Then it breaks into an even wider smile than before.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** ‚ÄúWith pleasure.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*It does the same as Gerard. Despite its enjoyment, it is clear that the pain is taking a toll on it. This is evidenced by it staggering back upon freeing its hand.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do whatever it takes.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ludus stares down at its finger stubs and then back at him.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** ‚ÄúI must admit your conviction is something to be admired. Perhaps in other circumstances, things would have worked out in your favor. Unfortunately, while the soul may be willing, the flesh is weak. This time, we‚Äôll be sharing in each other‚Äôs pain.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*It points to the stove. The knobs on it turn and the oven door falls open.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI swear I could smell the gas that was filling the kitchen in that video. Knowing what was coming twisted my stomach.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only from ashes that potential can truly rise.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Fire erupts from the oven, covering the kitchen in flames, accompanied both by Garard‚Äôs screams and Ludus's laughing.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I could feel the heat seeing that footage. It was like standing next to a roaring campfire. Unfortunately, it was clear who the winner was.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*After several minutes, the flames seize and the room clears. The view indicates that Gerard is lying on his back. He raises his hands, seeing them charred. Meaty footsteps can be heard. A scorched Ludus leers down at him. Its lips were entirely burnt off.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** ‚ÄúI know you must be disappointed right now. If it‚Äôs any consolation, you were quite entertaining and you will be able to guide your son through his final moments.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ludus walks away. Gerard yells both for help and in pain until he passes out. He wakes up later in ICU, covered in bandages with Ellen sitting in the chair beside his bed. She explains that she came by to get a toy of Anson‚Äôs from him but called an ambulance when she found him on the floor.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ellen:** ‚ÄúWhat were you doing in there?‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how I can explain it. Listen, I don‚Äôt know how much longer I‚Äôll last so it‚Äôs  important you do something for me.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ellen nods. Gerard tells her to ask that he be put in the same hospital as Anson. His request is granted and the footage cuts to him there in another bed beside Anson‚Äôs. Ellen is also there. Her eyes are red and puffy. Some family and friends are also present.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Anson:** ‚ÄúDad, I‚Äôm scared.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gerard:** ‚ÄúI know. I am too so let‚Äôs go together.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Gerard takes his hand. The video concludes by fading to black with the noise of flatlining beeps in the background.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis kept me up for a few days. Every time I closed my eyes, I would somehow find myself going through what Gerard did. Hell, I still have that nightmare sometimes among others. Therapy has helped somewhat at least. I need to wrap up this post, though so I‚Äôll explain what we found by going to the town the events took place in. We managed to get in touch with the family and friends of the victims.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThrough them, we learned that Ellen moved away a year after the death of her ex-husband and their son and has since gotten remarried, having three more kids. That‚Äôs some good news at least. I sincerely hope she is doing well. As for Ludus, my fear and hatred of it only grow stronger by the day. I know the threat it poses and I will not stop until this monster is ended.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is [Zane,](https://www.reddit.com/user/RoseBlack2222/submitted/) logging [out.](https://twitter.com/RoseBlack2222)",

        "text": "One night when i was driving home from a late night shift at my wor., I was on a high road normally filled with traffic at that time of night but there was no car but mine, i was almost out of fuel and spotted and my gps showed a gas station a mile away so i drove above the speed limit to reach it before my fuel ran out. When i reached it all the lights were on inside but nobody was there i thought maybe the worker was in the restroom so i thought nothing of it, i filled up my car and went in so i could pay and grab a drink and some stuff to eat, once i had entered there was still nobody in but there was a ATM so i went to it and pulled out around ¬£60 so i could pay for the gas and a snack i grabbed a pack of crisps, chocolate and a bottle of cola i went up to the till and i put the money on it and as i was about to leave i saw a shadow behind me it‚Äôs arms were the same height as me it was towering over me it had talons. \n\nI quickly turned around to see what it was and when i saw it i felt like i was paralysed it had no eyes instead it had holes where they would normally be the holes were deep going right through its head i could see the gas station wall through it. It‚Äôs neck was slit open bleeding out and it‚Äôs mouth was wide open with a grin and it‚Äôs sharp blood stained teeth, it had a old stained uniform on with rips in it and through the rips you could see it‚Äôs ribs bulging out looking like it hadn‚Äôt ate for years. I was horrified just standing there paralysed holding my stuff and out of nowhere it said ‚ÄúERDAN FORTIF NORAFI KERIF‚Äù it pulled its arm it and its talons that were atleast 4 inches looking like a knife moved to my throat as if it was going to slit it out of nowhere i no longer felt paralysed and my fight or flight kicked in, i punched it as hard as i could and it didn‚Äôt move a muscle it then said in a angrier tone ‚ÄúMERKAF MOFIAS GORIAR.‚Äù i ran as fast as i could. \n\nNot even going to the door and just jumping out the glass windows feeling the glass seep into my skin as i ran for my life to my car with it slowly chasing after my lifting it‚Äôs arms getting ready to grab me. It almost grabbed me but i just got out of its reach and when i had got to my car i didn‚Äôt even put my seat belt on. I just put my key in and it wouldn‚Äôt start i tried and i tried. \n\nIt then worked but by that time IT Had put it‚Äôs arm right through the window almost grabbing my neck but instead it cut my neck with its talons and i pushed down the acceleration with all the force i could. i had got away from the gas station thing i was safe then i heard a thump on top of my roof, It caught up to me i thought if i went as fast as my car could go it would fall of but it didn‚Äôt it put its hand through the hole in my window it left earlier and grabbed me by the throat and pulled me out of my car but luckily because the car was speeding it pushed forward knocking it off while i was in its hand it had let go and i thought it was dead so i ran as fast as i could to my car got in and went as fast as my car could go and got way from it. I am now in my house hopefully safe from it as i am writing this it is currently 3:56am and i live by myself i am praying that it doesn‚Äôt know where i live but if anything happens and i live i will update you",

        "text": "When people talk about the Mandela Effect, they usually mean a small change to a logo or something in pop culture. I have distinct memories of my old timeline being destroyed by parasites. \n\nIt would have been more merciful for them to just kill us. What they did was far more malicious.\n\nThe invasion was traced back to the Moon landing. When Neil Armstrong and his companions landed on the Moon, they brought back hitchhikers. Microscopic aliens that thrived in small colonies, taking over the minds and bodies of the infected, essentially killing them. Their bodies were piloted by colonies of millions of spores, completely unaware that they were long dead from brain rot.\n\nOne minute there was a corpse clawing at my window while muttering incoherently, the next my roommate was asking me if I wanted some coffee. \n\nIt was a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. When we landed on the Moon, they saw it as an opportunity. They knew a good thing when they saw it. They lay dormant there for who knows how long.\n\nWe were the perfect victims for the invasion. The economy was thriving, and the parasites found a foothold in our society. They made themselves right at home. It took decades for anyone to realize that something was wrong. \n\nThey incubated their eggs in asbestos, infecting millions of people in schools and businesses. To them it was a perfect way to hide in plain sight since asbestos was used in insulation everywhere. Nobody was the wiser until these buildings began to be torn down.\n\nErratic behavior as people aged was the first sign that something was wrong. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre from a different time.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just how they were raised.‚Äù Something more sinister was below the surface, and nobody was the wiser.\n\nThen came the incident with the urban explorer.\n\nA man in his early 20s was exploring an abandoned elementary school with some friends when the ceiling collapsed, pouring dust and old insulation into a classroom he was photographing. He had removed his mask to drink from his water bottle just before, and he got a lungful of spores.\n\nHis wife found him later that night staring out a window, swaying and humming. He turned to her and said, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre hungry.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat the hell are you talking about?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs hungry?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe colony must feed. They‚Äôre hungry.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 3 am. Quit being silly and come back to bed.‚Äù \n\nHe smiled. That was when she noticed the gun he was holding. He lifted it to his temple and pulled the trigger.\n\nAs time passed, the younger generations were less susceptible to the madness. They fought it off, and it destroyed many of them in different, more sinister ways. People spread it to their kids like a generational curse. However, the aliens were not prepared for how little interest some people took took in their own children. Many would not even speak to their kids, let alone hug them. This made growing the colony much more difficult, and as a result they began to die off.\n\nThe colony fed on brain matter, taking up permanent residence in the brain of the host. While the host could continue living for quite some time with the colony running the show, eventually their bodies aged and died. In some cases the colony had died off too, but in others they were able to continue piloting the corpse of the deceased. The host was not the same though, and even their families knew something was wrong.\n\nEventually, they drained us dry. That‚Äôs when things got worse.\n\nThe colony itself went mad. Without an adequate food supply, they couldn‚Äôt control their hunger or their hosts. More and more incidents started happening.\n\nThe infected were essentially zombies, some of them long deceased, lumbering around with the remnants of a once thriving colony of spores piloting their piles of mush brains.\n\nReports of the elderly clawing at windows in middle of the night started occurring. The reports were always the same. The intruder seemed disoriented and confused, and they almost always attacked.\n\nOne infected man wandered into a grocery store and stared blankly at the stocked shelves until an employee cautiously approached him. He tackled the employee and pinned her to the ground. The man bit off two of the fingers a customer who tried to help, making an unearthly shrieking sound the entire time. The employee luckily survived.\n\nAnother report was of an elderly woman standing outside the kitchen window of a young couple, staring in. The young woman who lived there was startled by the pair of eyes glaring at her at 3 a.m. The elderly woman started scratching at the window, a sneer on her face. ‚ÄúIs anyone going to let me in? Huh? Is anyone going to let me in?‚Äù The woman was gone by the time the police arrived.\n\nThe most horrifying was the incident at the retirement home, where a group of elderly turned on the staff. The scene was kicked off when an elderly man stabbed a nurse with a fork after telling her, ‚ÄúYou dress like a slut.‚Äù Three nurses and five residents died before the situation was brought under control. A witness said it was a bloodbath of clawing and biting, kicking and screaming.\n\nMore attacks happened, and chaos broke out. People panicked and began hoarding essential items, hiding inside their homes. Streets were filled with boarded up windows, residents attempting to keep out the rogue lumbering zombies that passed through their neighborhoods. Those who ventured out were careful to remain in the shadows and hide if they saw one of Them in the distance.\n\nThe infected muttered to themselves as they walked, so it was difficult for them to sneak up on anyone. They could be anywhere though, and they often caught people by surprise. By then it was too late. \n\nThis had become the new normal. People were still being infected and getting attacked. More and more infected invaded the streets, trying to find ways into strangers‚Äô homes at night when victims could not be found outside. Stores stopped opening. \n\nNot all of them behaved violently, but their deception was their strength once their bodies started to rot along with their minds. They could take the form of an elderly woman claiming to be lost. ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt you give your Granny a hug?‚Äù Spores were spread, and the madness continued.\n\nAutopsies were performed on some of the infected dead, and scientists attempted to create a vaccine. But any cure would kill the host, and the research was eventually abandoned. One scientist became infected during his research, spread the spores to his colleagues, and together they destroyed their lab before jumping out of their 10 story window. Nobody knows what exactly happened that day.\n\nThere was no end in sight. The destruction could not be stopped. Some believed that eventually the infected would die off on their own once the spores inside their heads no longer had any brain material left to eat. Nobody knew how long this would take, or what would be needed to restore order. Hope had all but been lost.\n\nThen, like it was all a bad dream, I was launched back into normalcy. Everyone I knew who had been infected was magically unharmed. Everything was the way it has always been, except a few minor differences that only a few people seemed to notice. No one knew what I was talking about when I asked about the invasion. I eventually stopped asking out of fear that I‚Äôd land myself a grippy socks vacation.\n\nI hope they never find this timeline.",

I'm thinking, why is there a marine walking around in full cammies when it isn't during the work week, at about 3:30 am on a Sunday, in the rain. He passes us and I say \"Hey man, what are you doing?\" Loud enough so he could hear. No response, I then yell \"Hey dude, what's your issue.\" Nothing again.

My heart sinks to my stomach. \"What the actual fuck dude, there's no way.\" we split up and jog around the area in case this guy was somehow able to make a 50 to 75-yard dash to the back of either of the buildings. Nothing.

Me and my buddy kept talking to a minimum the rest of the night because we were both creeped out from what we just experienced. He goes to every single door and window on the floor and checks that they're locked. He sits back down and goes back to whatever he was doing on his phone. something is fucking with the door on the outside of the laundry room, somehow the motion lights don't activate. the wind isn't blowing that hard, and last time I checked. Wind doesn't jerk on doorknobs. I creep over and throw the door open. sure enough, the motion lights turn on. Nothing. Back to the desk I go. Ready to nope the fuck out of there.

        "text": "I‚Äôm a detective and yes I know this should not be what I‚Äôm doing doing but I need to get this off my chest. I‚Äôve worked for years and I‚Äôve experienced something unlike anything you‚Äôll have ever heard of. It still makes no f***ing sense. \n\nYears ago a friend of mine who also worked at the police station informed me of a case. \n\nNAME: EMILY RHOADES\n\nA 32-year-old woman had gone missing in her home in the south-east side of the town. \n\nMissing peoples cases were rare for me in  town but not entirely uncustomary. \n\nMy colleague however stated that the woman‚Äôs husband wasn‚Äôt making any sense with his statement. \n\nMe being me, I decided to go see this man for more clarity on the event even though it wasn‚Äôt my case. I approached the door of the man‚Äôs house and knocked firmly. \n\nWhat greeted me was a slow uneasy opening of the door and a middle-aged man who looked like he hadn‚Äôt showered in weeks appearing. \n\nI told the man that I‚Äôd heard about the disappearance of his wife and wanted to ask a few simple questions. \n\nHe took me into his living room and as soon as I stepped in the room I noticed something strange. There was a mannequin of a blonde woman with glasses sitting on his couch. \n\nI tried my best to ignore it and sat on the single-seated couch adjacent to the mannequin.\n\nI didn‚Äôt want to be rude and ask but the man didn‚Äôt seem to act like anything was unnatural. \n\nThe man made us both a cup of tea and came and sat right next to the mannequin. \n\n‚ÄúSo, when did your wife go missing?‚Äù I queried. \n\n‚ÄúIt happened 3 days ago, I tried to look for her myself and I couldn‚Äôt find her anywhere. On the morning she went missing I came downstairs and I saw this mannequin here. \n\nIt‚Ä¶looks just like her? I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs happening. Where is my wife? How did this get here?‚Äù\n\nI looked into the eyes of the mannequin and something felt really off about it. For something that was mostly just plastic it looked extremely human-like. I felt very confused about the situation initially. \n\nMy rational mind then started to click. In an attempt to make sense of the encounter I assumed the man was crazy. The mannequin was perhaps some sort of coping mechanism after losing his wife who left him. \n\nI explained to him we would try everything in our power to find his wife and that we would try to follow any leads that came our way.\n\nShortly after leaving the man‚Äôs house and his creepy mannequin we did all the regular searches in the local area to find his wife. \n\nSadly we found nothing. Not a single trace. \n\nA few days pass and another case falls on my lap. \n\nNAME: KEVIN SANDERS \n\nIn this instance a 14-year-old boy is reported missing. I thought this was just another missing person case until I read more about the details of the report. \n\nIt stated that on the morning of his disappearance his mother tried to wake him up for school. \n\nShe entered his room and repeatedly said his name. \n\nNo answer.\n\nShe could visibly see a lump in the covers so she knew her son was there. \n\nWhen she went over and pulled the covers off her son, she found that a mannequin that looked just like her son was laying in a sleeping position on his bed. \n\nAgain, we did all the standard searches and we could not find the 14-year-old boy. The only thing left was this mannequin that appeared in his home. No explanation of how it got there. I checked everything, if there was a break-in, If the mother had spare keys someone might‚Äôve found. \n\nNothing.\n\nNaturally, we took the mannequins in for evidence. We had 2 of them in our ‚Äúcollection‚Äù now. \n\nThe most disturbing thing about these mannequins were just how much they looked like the missing person they‚Äôd replaced. They were practically a 1 for 1 look-a-like. \n\nThe most notable difference was that lights reflected off the plastic distinctly differently the way it does to human skin. \n\nIt made all of us at the station feel incredibly uneasy. We were now definitely aware that something stranger was going on. \n\n2 people gone and 2 mannequins that look like them appearing in a relatively similar part of town. \n\nObviously not a coincidence.\n\nA week later and we couldn‚Äôt fathom what was happening. What started as a few of these cases had grown into a large number very quickly. \n\nI trembled as I flipped through a sizeable pile of files that ended up on my desk on Monday morning. \n\nNAME: BETH HIGGINS \n\n72-year-old woman reported missing by her family. A day later a mannequin that looks just like her was found sat on a bench of the local park she used to visit frequently.\n\nNAME: JUDE LAWRY\n\n41-year-old man reported missing by his brother. Later on this same day, it‚Äôs found that there is a mannequin that looks like the man located underneath the truck in the garage. This man was a mechanic and was apparently in the process of repairing his brothers truck which had broken down recently.  \n\nNAME: JOSH SOUTTAR\n\n6-month-old baby missing. A mannequin of a baby is found in the crib by the infant‚Äôs parents. \n\nAfter a 3 week period, we found that 9 people in the same town had disappeared and were replaced by a mannequin version of themselves. \n\nWe were dealing with a kidnapper. A serial kidnapper who was clearly messed up in the head. Creating mannequins of people‚Äôs loved ones to give to their families after abducting them. \n\nSeriously what the f*** was going on?\n\nWe tried so hard to find anything about these disappearances and we found nothing. Not a single lead. \n\nIt was genuinely just like 11 people were replaced in an instant by a mannequin version of themselves. \n\nNow here‚Äôs where this gets really bizarre.\n\nYou see, where I‚Äôm from we can only hold evidence for 6 months after the time of an offence. In that time period, we found nothing of importance regarding the mannequins. No fingerprints, no loose hairs on them. Nothing ultimately useful to us. Therefore they had to be returned to the place we‚Äôd found them. \n\nThe dozens of mannequins that had collected up dust in our evidence room therefore had to be given back to their ‚Äúowners‚Äù. \n\nDo you have any idea how f***** up it is to return a mannequin of someone‚Äôs loved one after several months when YOU are supposed to be the one helping to return their real loved one? \n\nWe had to return dozens of mannequins to the people who found them. They reacted to this as you‚Äôd expect with a lot of sadness. Anger. Puzzlement. \n\nWe didn‚Äôt really know what they‚Äôd do with the mannequins but we expected that most of them, if not all of them, would simply get rid of them. \n\nA month after returning the mannequins to the victim‚Äôs loved ones I received a call from an unknown number. \n\nIt turned out to be the man from the first case who‚Äôs wife was still missing. \n\nHe sounded rather panicked and was mumbling every other word conveyed. \n\nHe told me that he put the mannequin in the attic as he understandably couldn‚Äôt stand the sight of it. \n\nOn one night, he went into his kitchen before he was about to sleep to get a glass of water. He entered the gloomy room and promptly turned on the lights. \n\nWhen he looked across the kitchen he jumped backwards and fell to the floor.\n\nThe man said that the mannequin of his wife. The mannequin that he put in the attic, was standing over the kitchen sink. \n\nIt just stood there utterly lifeless however it‚Äôs arms had changed position and it somehow had a cloth in its hands. It looked like the plastic humanoid figure was about to clean some dishes. \n\nStupidly, I downplayed this as at the time because I thought this man was just insane. When I visited him everything about his mannerisms told me this was the case. \n\nA day later I get another call. This time it‚Äôs from the mother of the 14-year-old boy who informed me she did something similar with her mannequin. \n\nIt was put away in the garage with the intention of destroying it as it reminded her of her missing son which made her extremely depressed. \n\nOver time, she‚Äôd forgotten that she‚Äôd even received the mannequin again as she almost never went into her garage for anything. \n\nShe came home one evening and opened the door to her lonely house.  \n\nThe mother screamed as she was greeted by the mannequin of her son standing right behind the front door. \n\nAgain, the mannequin had seemingly changed its figure. The mother said that when she opened the door, the mannequin of her son was stood in the open hallway pointing directly at the door.\n\nDirectly at her. \n\nShe looked into it‚Äôs eyes and said that she felt a level of fear she‚Äôd never experienced before. When I interviewed her after she said it was though the spirit of her son was shaming her. Shaming her for letting him get abducted at such a young age. \n\nWhen we checked her home the mannequin was indeed in the position she claimed it was. \n\nAll of a sudden it was like these pieces of plastic had minds of their own. \n\nMultiple people from previous cases said that the mannequins of their loved ones were moving on their own accord. \n\nIn the police station we now believed that the kidnapper, after many months of inactivity, had returned to yet again mess with the loved ones of the victims. This was a trend in the actions of this deranged psychopath. \n\nOne of the people said to us that they were in the kitchen making a late evening meal. Halfway through making some chicken teriyaki they glanced over at the open door to the living room. \n\nTo their horror, they saw the tilted head of the mannequin of their own sister peering around the doorway. The only thing they could see was the head of the mannequin leaning around whilst the rest of the body was concealed.\n\nIt was like the mannequin was menacingly watching her sister cook this meal. This made her scream and run out the back door before she told us about this. \n\nThe last call of the week was perhaps the most dangerous and unsettling of all the stories we‚Äôd heard about the mannequins. \n\nRemember the brother of the mechanic I mentioned earlier? He too found that the mannequin of his brother was moving around their home when he wasn‚Äôt looking. It scared him so much that he took the mannequin outside and tried to burn it. \n\nBurning plastic isn‚Äôt exactly effective however he was able to completely disfigure the mannequin and left it‚Äôs tatters in garden. \n\nDuring the night the man awoke in his bedroom and felt something poking against his chest. He reached over to his bed-side light and turned it on with the flick of a switch. \n\nThe man yelled and frantically pushed as he ran out of his house with only his pants on. \n\nThe man claimed that when he turned on the light, he saw the mannequin of his brother standing over him in his sleep. \n\nThe mannequin that was previously left in tatters was somehow completely repaired. \n\nIt had a knife going through its hand and it was holding it against the man‚Äôs chest. \n\nThe scariest thing, was the reported facial expression of the mannequin. \n\nYou see, the mannequins all had a tone deaf expression, as you‚Äôd expect. When the man turned on the light he said that the mannequin had lowered its head and looked directly into his eyes with the knife on his chest. \n\nIt didn‚Äôt have a tone-deaf expression. \n\nInstead, it displayed an emotion of anger. \n\nThe man saw the plastic face of his own brother looking down on him as though he despised him more than anything else in the world. \n\nAlmost like it hated the fact the brother tried to burn the mannequin and wanted revenge. \n\nWe knew that we needed to take the mannequins back into evidence as soon as possible. The cases were officially being reopened. Before we could do this, all of the mannequins on what appeared to be the exact same day had disappeared.\n\nThey were never seen again.\n\nWe had just set up a variety plans to catch the kidnapper too. This included newly set-up CCTV footage to capture who this person was. \n\nThe disappearance of the mannequins however meant that the kidnapper also went back into hiding. \n\nTo this day I‚Äôm left with night terrors about these cases. You have no idea how much it hurts to see these people so upset and you essentially can‚Äôt do anything. I‚Äôll never be able to shake this feeling off for the rest of my life. \n\nThe people who disappeared before the arrival of the mannequins have been missing for years. \n\nGod bless their souls. \n\nWherever they are.",

        "text": "Before I had a chance to ask her what she meant, she signaled that she was moving on to the next person in line. Dressed in a mish-mash of colorful clothing, with the kind of crazy eyes that dart out wildly, she didn‚Äôt exactly radiate authority which made it hard to take her seriously. On the other hand, what if she was right? \n\n‚ÄúDo you mean I‚Äôll get diabetes?‚Äù I asked. I closed my eyes as a memory surfaced from six months earlier: a navy Mercedes crookedly parked across from the office building where I worked, with the front door eerily open for days, as if begging to be stolen. The owner never did come back, after suffering a diabetic episode which ultimately claimed his life. The car was eventually impounded.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs absolutely *imperative* that you keep away from sugar,‚Äù the fortune teller repeated, without answering my question. Before I could try again, she had already turned her attention to the next client.\n\nThe prediction creeped me out enough to make an appointment with my PCP and ask for a comprehensive blood test checking my glucose level. Then I spent the rest of the day shaking, until I learned the results.\n\n‚ÄúIt's slightly elevated,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust avoid sweets and get more exercise.‚Äù \n\nFast forward to a month later, and I did everything possible to eliminate sugar from my life. I cleaned up my apartment, throwing away any remaining candy, cookies, and packaged goods. I spent lengthy shopping trips, carefully studying the ingredients label of every item I purchased. But gradually, refusing sugar became harder and harder. \n\nIt wasn‚Äôt just my urges to nibble on chocolate whenever I was depressed or anxious (which became a frequent occurrence after I failed my bar exam, lost my best friend Georgina to her new husband, and got dumped by my boyfriend Ryan who had passed the same bar exam that I failed‚Äîall in the span of two weeks). It was the way I was surrounded by sugar: driving past a busy Starbucks everyday on the way to my secretarial job, avoiding the office vending machines like the plague, and cancelling my cost-saving ‚Äúwith ads‚Äù streaming plan after the same commercial for Godiva chocolate seemed to stalk me every time I tried to watch something. \n\nBut the more I fought it, the worse I got. There was my grandmother, who got offended when I turned down her homemade brownies. My sister Kylie, who threw me a surprise birthday party and then got pissed when I refused to eat the cake. And finally, my favorite law professor Mrs. Gatsberry, who invited me out for coffee and became mystified when I refused to touch the donuts she had ordered to go along with it. By the end of our coffee date, she walked back her offer to help tutor me for the bar exam. \n\nThe thing was, I didn‚Äôt lie about why I avoided sugar. I mean, I didn‚Äôt tell anyone about the fortune teller because they‚Äôd think I‚Äôm nuts, but I did tell them about my elevated glucose levels. \n\nMy sister and grandmother didn‚Äôt get it. \n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like you *have* diabetes,‚Äù my sister said. \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve had higher glucose levels ever since my stress over a miscarriage almost killed me, *and* I still eat sweets,‚Äù my grandmother said. \n\nThen there was Mrs. Gatsberry‚Äôs reaction: a faint shake of the head, followed by a sour expression. After eating the box of donuts all by herself, she hadn‚Äôt spoken a single word to me since.\n\nFast forward a year and I got engaged to Ty, who I met online. As luck would have it, he was an aspiring pastry chef. He knew my anti-sugar position, though was still visibly hurt that he couldn‚Äôt get me to try any of his mouth-watering desserts. Every night he would lock himself in the kitchen and spend hours experimenting with them, on his way to achieving his dream of opening his own coffee shop. \n\nFast forward another year, and my now-husband used our newly purchased house as collateral to finance his coffee shop, which he named ‚ÄúSweet Life.‚Äù A small crowd gathered for the grand opening, which finished with free pastries and coffee for all. I took small sips of the coffee and stayed away from the pastries altogether, ignoring the raised eyebrows. Right before everyone dispersed, one of the attendees pulled me aside and loudly asked if the pastries were bad. Surprised by the question, I told her that I was on a sugar-free diet and that it had nothing to do with Ty‚Äôs pastry skills, which were divine. In response, the woman‚Äôs eyes narrowed. She didn‚Äôt believe me. \n\nMonths later, we had to shut down Ty‚Äôs coffee shop. After the grand opening when everyone had complimented his pastries, the coffee shop became a ghost town. Ty blamed me. The woman who had taken me aside to ask why I hadn‚Äôt eaten the pastries myself turned out to be a gossip machine, and spread rumors that there must be something seriously wrong with Ty‚Äôs pastries if his own wife refused to touch them. When we tried to confront her lies, the city‚Äôs mayor paid us a visit and threatened us with legal action if we didn‚Äôt leave ‚Äúhis daughter‚Äù alone. After that, the few customers that we had managed to accrue stopped coming once and for all.\n\nDays after the coffee shop‚Äôs doors shuttered for the last time, Ty filed for divorce. If his wife had been anyone else, he told all his friends and family members, the coffee shop wouldn‚Äôt have become the disaster that it was. As if that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, after losing Ty and the coffee shop, I then lost my house, which had been used as collateral to finance the opening of Ty‚Äôs coffee shop.\n\nAvoiding sugar had ruined my life. For the first time since the fortune teller had made her prediction, I began to wonder if any of it had even been worth it. Since when did some random lady become my go-to authority anyway? For all I knew, she might have been a fraud and not even a real fortune teller. Fuck her. \n\nAs I returned to the dating scene and began studying for my second attempt at the bar exam, I began to gradually return to sugar. Nothing crazy. Just a candy here or there. Sometimes even a mini-cupcake, or half a donut. Each time, I waited for something horrible to happen. And each time, nothing did. \n\nI went back to my PCP and demanded another blood test to check my glucose level. After all this time of staying away from sugar, it was completely normal. \n\n‚ÄúYou can have all the sweets you want,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have anything to worry about.‚Äù\n\nAs the date of the bar exam approached and I became frantic over not failing it again, I devised a new strategy to cram as much studying into my days as possible. Up to now, I had been avoiding coffee because I hated its bitter taste. But since sugar was no longer banned from my life, it stopped being an issue. Every time I felt sleepy, I gulped down the coffee and became alert once again. Gradually, I stopped sleeping altogether, using the time to study instead. \n\nAfter taking the bar exam for the second time, I passed it with flying colors. Shortly afterwards, my ex-boyfriend Ryan reappeared in my life. Now that I had passed the bar exam, he was interested in me once more. Fast forward to four months later. I accepted a six-figure position as an associate lawyer in a law firm that did business with Ryan‚Äôs law firm, after which Ryan proposed. We got married a year later, on the grounds of his wealthy family‚Äôs estate. \n\nInstead of ruining my life, sugar had actually *saved* it. Soon, my old pattern of depression and anxiety gave way to unexpected happiness.  Ryan and I honeymooned in Paris, spending every morning eating crepes, alternating between Nutella and whipped cream for toppings. In the back of my mind, I kept waiting for something bad to happen. At that point, the habit had become so ingrained in my mind, that it was almost impossible to get rid of. But as we toured the Eiffel tower, visited the Louvre, and took photos beside the Champs-Elysees, it couldn‚Äôt have gone better. \n\nAfter we safely returned to the U.S., Ryan bought us a chocolate Labrador he named Candy. And, okay, I loved Candy. The most loyal, friendly dog I had ever come across. But in the back of my mind, I wondered if Ryan was now taunting me. After all, he could‚Äôve just as easily purchased a golden retriever and named him Frank or something. \n\nRegardless of Ryan‚Äôs intentions, Candy was a sweetheart, no pun intended. I would walk her each morning at five a.m., shortly before waking myself with a cup of coffee and getting ready for work. Even though the vast volumes of documents got old fast, I gradually worked my way up in the law firm, and started getting assigned to more important clients. In my free time, I found myself taking up baking. I had never been much of a cook, but found the activity unexpectedly relaxing. Ryan praised my efforts, and before I knew it, we got into a habit of finishing our days with cake and tea. Once again, I waited to see if something bad would happen. And once again, nothing did. Well, nothing apart from a few cavities.\n\nFinally, I decided to put the fortune teller out of my mind once and for all. Clearly, her prediction had not come true and I had overreacted, squandering my first marriage and almost ruining my life in the process. I would not make that mistake again. Especially when everything was going so well. \n\nOne day, Ryan told me his parents had thrown a party to celebrate their fiftieth wedding anniversary and would ‚Äònever forgive him‚Äô if we didn‚Äôt attend. And so, after buying some commemorative jewelry and a bottle of vintage whiskey, we arrived on the designated date. \n\nThe party was held at Ryan‚Äôs parents‚Äô home. James and Janice had been inseparable since high school, and a full house was assembled for their special evening, complete with a live band and waiters. Janice‚Äôs best friend made a tearful speech, followed by James‚Äôs brother roasting the couple. There were lots of hors d‚Äôoeuvres and toasts to the happy couple, with their photographs projected all over the walls. The guests argued over who they loved more‚ÄîJames or Janice‚Äîand kept telling Ryan how lucky he was to have them for parents. By the end of the evening, everyone was out on the dance floor, with the couple of the evening taking center stage to the sound of jazz music.\n\nIt was a lovely evening and by the time the guests began to leave, I told Ryan how much I had enjoyed it. Ryan told me ‚ÄúI knew you would,‚Äù and gave me a little kiss, before excusing himself to go to the bathroom. After the rest of the guests had left, followed by the waiters and the live band, his parents and I were left alone in the room. I congratulated them, and said how much I hoped to one day celebrate my own fiftieth wedding anniversary with Ryan. Janice gave me a wink, before excusing herself to go to the kitchen, where the remains of the evening‚Äôs feast had been moved. That left just James and me. I looked at my watch. Ryan was really taking his time in that bathroom.\n\n‚ÄúCan I show you something?‚Äù James asked pleasantly, tearing me away from my watch. ‚ÄúIt will only take a moment. Follow me.‚Äù\n\nI nodded, intrigued. We walked to the other end of their mansion, and before I knew it, we were in the basement. \n\n‚ÄúIt will only take a moment,‚Äù James repeated.\n\n‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre not gifting us anything,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúRyan said you can sometimes be too generous.‚Äù\n\nBut instead of responding, James locked the door behind him. A minute later, he turned back to me with an odd expression I had never seen before.\n\n‚ÄúGood, glad Ryan has finally decided to keep it in the family. Something he should‚Äôve been concerned about *before* he married you.‚Äù\n\nUp until now, James had never been anything but nice to me, so his sudden coldness didn‚Äôt make sense. I tried to rewind my actions during the evening, trying to guess if I could‚Äôve unknowingly offended him in some way. But try as I might, I couldn‚Äôt come up with anything. \n\n‚ÄúI beg your pardon?‚Äù I said, hoping I misheard him.\n\n‚ÄúYour parents spent part of your childhood on welfare. You went to public school and had an unimpressive academic record. The fact that you failed the bar exam was no surprise. The surprise was that you managed to pass it the second time around.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù I felt myself growing hot like a volcano.\n\n‚ÄúAfter marrying a fellow loser, you lost your house to his ill-conceived business which went bankrupt a few months after its grand opening. Then, after parting ways with him, you clawed your way back into the good graces of my son, even going as far as passing the bar exam just so he could override any objections that I had against you.‚Äù\n\nHis words were like knives, biting me with each syllable. And yet, I couldn‚Äôt stop listening to them.\n\n‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve left Ryan alone, but no, you just *had* to have the ring.‚Äù James made a sigh, a sound that was not unlike that of a hissing snake. ‚ÄúBy the way, your law firm is about to fire you, did you know that?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù For a second, I snapped out of my trance, trying to recall how I had left work the day before. There had been nothing unusual in the air. No major problems either.\n\n‚ÄúOh, so it‚Äôs news to you,‚Äù James continued, curling his lips into a smile. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre downsizing and can‚Äôt afford your services any more. And no, I‚Äôm not willing to talk to one of the partners on your behalf again. That‚Äôs how you got that job in the first place, you know. Don‚Äôt look at me like that. Surely you don‚Äôt think that any law firm worth its salt would‚Äôve hired someone who failed their bar exam the first time around? These jobs are already competitive as is.‚Äù\n\nMy jaw dropped, when I realized what he was saying. While my employer did business with Ryan‚Äôs employer, it had never entered my mind until now that it had been anything but a coincidence. \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to let my son subsidize you,‚Äù James said, ‚Äúand I know you won‚Äôt be able to find a good job on your own that was as well-paying as your old one. Which leaves us with‚Ä¶a very expensive divorce, since Ryan was dumb enough to marry you without a prenup. Not an option either, as far as I‚Äôm concerned.‚Äù\n\nI stared at James, trying to figure out where he was going with this. I didn‚Äôt have to wait for long. By the time he pulled out a gun with a silencer, I was too stunned to even scream, unable to believe what I was seeing.\n\n‚ÄúJust a robbery gone wrong,‚Äù James continued. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, it happens. Especially with someone wealthy like us.‚Äù\n\nAs he pointed the gun at me, I heard his wife‚Äôs voice above us, coming from somewhere in the house:\n\n‚ÄúSugar, where are you?‚Äù",

        "author": "Southern_Bathroom_89",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11d278z/i_am_a_psychiatric_nurse_working_in_the_hospital/",
        "text": "As the title explains, I work as a Psychiatric Nurse in the hospital. Although a little green in my career, I have my fair share of different experiences working with mental illness. \n\n\nThe hospital I work at has a small mental health unit (often referred to as the psych ward). It is located in the basement of the hospital with 25 beds; there is one 4 bed men‚Äôs ward and one women‚Äôs dorm with 5 private rooms within this unit. The unit is L shaped, with the nursing station positioned in the middle to be able to see down both hallways. Since we do get a lot of patients certified under the Mental Health Act, this unit is locked at all times. Access is granted through a swipe card system. Any names or places to be mentioned have been changed/redacted due confidentiality. \n\n\nMy day began as any other would, by taking report from the day shift nurse. Seeing as I am still fairly new to this hospital, I predominantly pick up night shifts (730pm-730am) as they are generally the only ones available. The day shift nurse debriefed me on my patient load, and what the day had looked like. ‚ÄúHonestly, I think you‚Äôll have a relatively chill night‚Äù Rebekah said, ‚Äúnot much went on today. The new guy in room B17 came to us yesterday and is currently waiting on a confirmed diagnosis from the psychiatrist; he has mostly kept to himself. I haven‚Äôt had a chance to look up his history yet, so I don‚Äôt have much to give you‚Äù. As I settled myself into my station, a small elderly man with brown hair appeared at the desk. ‚ÄúHi, are you stacey, my nurse?‚Äù He asked nervously. He stated that his name was Eric and is currently in room B17. ‚ÄúYes I am! It‚Äôs lovely to meet you; let me organize myself, and I will come and have a chat with you, okay?‚Äù I said, he just nodded and walked away. \n\n\nOnce organized, I made my way down to Eric‚Äôs room. He sat on the edge of the bed looking rather nervous. This wasn‚Äôt unexpected as the unit can be overwhelming to be on. ‚ÄúWhat brings you into our care, Eric?‚Äù. Eric began telling me how he had been apprehended in the community for disturbing behaviour. It all started with having gaps in his memory; chunks of time he had no recollection of what he was doing. ‚ÄúSome days I‚Äôd come to in a strange house. It was often turned upside down, like it had been trashed by teenagers; other times it would be something as simple as being completely naked and covered in dirt in my backyard‚Äù he said. \n\nWhile talking, I felt the sense of familiarity with other patients I had taken care of previously. Having gaps in memory is not uncommon when patients are living with a mental illness, or on certain medication. Heck, I had a patient who slept-walked all the way to the grocery store and bought a pint of ice cream, only to come to with melted ice cream in their bed. We chatted for awhile longer, offering him reassurance that he is in the right place to help sort through what he is experiencing. After we were done chatting, it was about 8pm and it was time to begin my medication round. \n\n\nWhile beginning my med  rounds, I noticed a foul smell coming from Eric‚Äôs room; it reminded me of sulphur mixed with vomit. When I approached the room, Eric was no where to be found. I notified my colleague Sarah and began to search the unit frantically. It had only been about 20 minutes since I had left him to pour medication. After a full sweep of the unit, all we found were the hospital pajamas strewn across the room floor, that we had provided Eric upon admission. Closer inspection revealed a strange black liquid staining the collar of the shirt. This liquid was responsible for the awful scent I had experienced. \n\n\nAfter I called security, we sent out a warrant to the police to detain him on sight and bring him back into our care, incase he had managed to get out into the community. While waiting for a call back, I began to review the door camera feed. From the start of my shift to the time Eric went missing only two patients had exited the unit (with permission from their nurse) with no trace of Eric. The evening paced on without a word from security or the police; I began to feel frantic as losing a patient does happen, but does not look good for a new nurse. \n\n\nBy 11pm there was still no word from anyone regarding Eric‚Äôs whereabouts. I called security to check back in, but no one had answered. Sarah and I began our first round of checks to ensure patients were safe and sleeping, I walked by Eric‚Äôs room again. That awful smell still penetrated my nostrils. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you mean ‚Äòawful‚Äô smell‚Äù Sarah stated, ‚ÄúI think it kind of smells like fresh rain and cut grass‚Äù.  I ignored her comment and decided to do another sweep of Eric‚Äôs room, while Sarah continued with the night checks. While inspecting the bathroom, I noticed more of the black liquid found on his pajamas, was now dripping out of the vent above the toilet. ‚ÄúStrange‚Äù I thought, ‚ÄúI never noticed that before when we checked the bathroom‚Äù. \n\n\nAs I continued looking at this black liquid I began to feel a sense of dread creeping up my spine. I walked back out into the hall, and the sense of unease continued. The unit was generally filled with sounds of call bells, patients getting up or quiet chatter from the nurses, but at this moment it was as silent as the morgue. I stepped back out into the hallway and noticed the nursing station lights had been turned off, which was a big no-no due to safety of the staff. \n\n\nAs I began to walk towards the station I heard a sick squelching sound behind me, coming from the 4-bed room at the end of the hall. I turned off my flashlight and tiptoed down the hall. For whatever reason, I felt safer inspecting the sounds in the cover of darkness. The squelching sound got louder as I entered the room, and the overwhelming sulphur/vomit smell entered my nostrils; as I scanned the room each bed was empty. \n\n\nWhen my eyes had finally adjusted to the pitch black, I noticed the curtain at the back of the room began to waver slightly. As I approached the movement, my eyes could make out 4 outlines of what appeared to be people crouching beside the bed and curtain. The patients, I assumed, had gathered together sneakily to talk at night. This wasn‚Äôt an uncommon occurrence as the unit could get lonely at times. ‚ÄúHey gentlemen, I just have to let you know it is time for bed. Socializing can continue tomorrow, I promise‚Äù I said, as I went to turn on the light. ‚ÄúI will rip you limb from limb, if you turn on that light‚Äù a voice hissed at me. I froze, that same sense of dread came back immediately. Quivering, I took out my flashlight and turned it on; the 4 crouching shapes dashed out of view of the light, and I finally noticed what they were standing over. Sarah lay there lifeless, blood pouring out from a wound in her chest. \n\n\nI gasped, nearly tripping over my own feet as I began backing up. Keeping my flashlight on her lifeless body, I began to see her arms twitch; slowly, she rose to sit up. As she turned to face me, her mouth began to stretch open to the point I thought her jaw might come unhinged. She let out an ear piercing scream. Her body began convulsing and sizzling as the same foul-smelling black liquid seeped from his mouth. I froze, my legs wouldn‚Äôt cooperate to run. Suddenly, a black silhouette ran past me and knocked the flashlight out of my hand and sent me flying back towards the door. With this sudden occurrence I felt my legs begin to gain feeling again; my brain screamed at me to run. \n\n\nI sprinted out of the room as fast as I could, running towards the nursing station. ‚ÄúWhere is everyone?‚Äù My frantic brain tried to process. I leapt over the desk and made my way to the staff bathroom. As I got there the door was locked, I began frantically knocking until the door opened and an arm pulled me into the bathroom. Rebekah put a hand over my mouth and told me to be quiet; why was she still here? She looked at me with her flashlight shining in her face ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make a noise‚Äùshe said, ‚Äúthey can hear it‚Äù. Without talking, she quickly typed up on her phone her reason for being there. She attempted to text it to me, but the service on the unit is terrible, ‚Äúfucking basement‚Äù I thought.  Instead, she showed me and her phone screen read:\n\n\nWhen I went to leave from day shift, I had gone to the cafeteria to meet with a couple girlfriends for dinner. About an hour in the cafeteria closed, and I was getting ready to leave. I noticed Eric wandering the halls by the cafeteria with a blank stare in his eyes. He was completely naked. I went out to ask him how he had gotten off the unit when he just turned to me with his mouth stretched open. Black liquid began to seep from his mouth and eyes as he screamed. His skin began to sizzle as he became enraged with the lights in the hall. He began to climb the wall, and crawled along the ceiling, smashing lights. He scurried along and began to charge me; I panicked and opened the door to the janitor closet to hide. He screeched at the light from the janitors closet and scurried into a ceiling vent. I hid there for a couple of hours, until I thought it was safe. When I re-entered the hallway everything was dark and there were no sounds. As I began to walk, I heard footsteps running towards me. I ran to this unit because of the locked doors, I thought it was safe in here. When I didn‚Äôt see any of you, I ran to the staff bathroom to take cover. \n\n\nI couldn‚Äôt believe what I had just read, what was going on with Eric? How could such a small, elderly man scale the walls like that?\n\n\nAs I handed back the phone to Rebekah, I noticed black liquid falling onto the phone screen. Rebekah and I both froze; turning her flashlight upwards, we saw Eric dangling out of the vent with a sick grin on his face, ‚Äúnow what did I say about lights being used?‚Äù He hissed again. In a matter of seconds, Eric jumped onto Rebekah, smashing her phone in the process. I watched in horror as he began tearing at her chest, exposing her rib cage. He sank his teeth into her sternum before violently ripping it out. \n\n\nI ran, I just ran. I didn‚Äôt know what else to do. Rebekah was gone. No where felt safe, until I remembered our storage room at the end of the hall; I sprinted for dear life. As I did, I began to hear rapid footsteps coming at me from all directions. \n\n\nI barely made it to the storage closet. Upon closing it multiple bodies rammed themselves into the door. I cried silently, as the noises began to decrease until it was dead silent again. \n\n\nThis is where I have been for 2 hours now, and I managed to connect to the hospital wi-fi. It keeps cutting in and out and I haven‚Äôt been able to send a text or call due to same. I‚Äôm not sure if this will even post, but I don‚Äôt know what else to do. I found a flashlight and scoured the ceiling for vents, but there‚Äôs only one small one about 6‚Äùx6‚Äù. Although the sulphur/vomit smell still emanated from it, I felt safe as no human, regardless of how unwell they were, could fit through that. I haven‚Äôt heard any commotion since. Please pray for me. I will update if I can. \n\nUpdate: it has been another hour now, and the strangest thing has happened. The sulphur/vomit smell is gone from the vent, and has been replaced with this wonderful scent of fresh rain and grass. I think they‚Äôve finally left, and I am safe to go back out. I unlocked the storage room door to make sure rescue can find me. Thank god this nightmare is over.",

        "text": "On the drive home from my boyfriend Evan‚Äôs funeral, his car tried to kill me. I suppose I should have been suspicious when he left it to me. He had never given me a gift without strings attached. And I guess I shouldn‚Äôt have taken it personally. After all, plenty of other people died that day.\n\nBut I was the one trapped inside.\n\nFirst, I watched helplessly as it mowed through the crowd of mourners as they crossed the street. Elderly grandmothers and grandsons alike bumped beneath the wheels as the car accelerated from zero to eighty in a matter of seconds.\n\n‚ÄúStop!‚Äù I shouted at the car. ‚ÄúManual override!‚Äù\n\nBut the car‚Äôs AI didn‚Äôt obey.\n\nThe dashboard flashed with the words, ‚ÄúRequiem Mode‚Äù as the car sped out the cemetery and onto the city streets, weaving through traffic and ignoring traffic signs. I tried to jiggle the door handle and manually pull the locks, but it was no use. The car wasn‚Äôt letting me out.\n\n‚ÄúWhy are you doing this?‚Äù I screamed.\n\nThat‚Äôs when I heard Evan‚Äôs voice playing over the car audio.\n\n‚ÄúHey, Naomi. If you‚Äôre hearing this, I guess I didn‚Äôt survive the surgery. Huge bummer for both of us. You may not have known this, but if I‚Äôd made it, I was planning to propose. There‚Äôs this beautiful bluff overlooking the pacific over in Half Moon Bay. Man, you would have definitely said yes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù I shouted. ‚ÄúI was going to break up with you. I just couldn‚Äôt find a way to do it after you got a goddamned *brain tumor.* I was trying to be nice!‚Äù\n\nBut of course, Evan didn‚Äôt respond back. The whole thing was just a recording. The AI driving the car could respond to a few basic commands, but it wasn‚Äôt exactly equipped to have a conversation.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a diamond ring in the glove compartment if you‚Äôd don‚Äôt believe me,‚Äù said Evan. ‚ÄúWe would have been so happy together. I had so many plans for us. So many! I‚Äôm sure by next year, I would have made director at CarBrain! And then you could have quit that stupid job at the library and gotten to work on our family! I know, I know. I‚Äôm sure wedding planning would have taken up a lot of your time, but I was totally willing to knock you up first!‚Äù\n\nI kicked at the window, but it was no good. The glass were made of some kind of nearly unscratchable material, the same kind they used on iPhones. There‚Äôd been so many nights in bed where Evan had droned on and on about the project. Maybe I should have paid better attention. \n\nBut he just made it so hard. Sometimes I‚Äôd play a game with myself where I‚Äôd set a timer to see how long it took him to ask a single question about my day. Sometimes the answer was all night.\n\n‚ÄúI was never going to marry you!‚Äù I screamed helplessly as the car swerved around a blind corner, hitting a boy riding a skateboard. The impact was so rapid that the boy practically exploded. The windshield wipers came on automatically to wash away the red spray.\n\nI was breathing so hard I thought I might pass out by that point. I tried to think back to some mindfulness exercises I‚Äôd learned in my Yoga class, but I came up blank. Of course, that stuff had never worked for me.\n\nThe only place I felt calm was in the library. If Evan had ever bothered to ask, I would have told him about that. How when I was twelve and my dad would come home drunk from his shift, I‚Äôd bike over there and bury myself in books until closing, how even when the rest of my world was falling apart, I knew I was safe there.\n\nThe car merged onto the coastal highway, clipping a bicyclist as we accelerated. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to look back at what we‚Äôd left of him.\n\n‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I told the car, trying to calm down. ‚ÄúPlease just stop. Please just let me out.‚Äù\n\nAnd all the while, Evan still wouldn‚Äôt shut up. Even in death. As his monologue continued, I looked all around the car for some kind of tool that would let me out. I tried clutching a key in my fist and stabbing at the glass, but I didn‚Äôt even nick it.\n\n‚Äú...which I guess brings us to now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI guess I figured in case I kicked the bucket, I needed to make sure I brought you with me. I know you‚Äôve never believed in all this god stuff, but I *know* there‚Äôs some kind of afterlife. And I‚Äôm just no good without you. So‚Ä¶ I figured I‚Äôd kind of bring you with me after the funeral. Sorry if that's a little faster than you wanted, but compared to eternity, what are a few years of life, right?‚Äù\n\nI couldn‚Äôt panic. I had to think. \n\nAnd so I went to the library.\n\nI closed all of my senses as best I could, covering my eyes with my arm and trying to ignore the sound of Evan‚Äôs voice. \n\nI was twelve again, and walking through the library stacks, carefully reading the dewey decimal numbers. I was looking for a book whose number I‚Äôd written with a tiny pencil on a notecard. What had it been about?\n\nI passed history, biography and finally ended up in the geology section. There, I flipped through books on volcanoes and the history of the planet, none quite the right match for my card. And then finally, I found the one I was looking for: precious stones.\n\nI flipped through the dusty pages, the musty smell of age filling my nostrils. And finally I saw it, the page on diamonds, a perfect 10 on Moh‚Äôs scale of hardness. Perfectly capable of breaking glass.\n\nAs I snapped back to reality, I realized the car was slowing down slightly, veering off the road onto a grassy field that seemed to crest up into the sky. And as I looked toward our destination, my stomach sank. These were the cliffs Evan must have been talking about, a two-hundred foot drop straight into the Pacific. \n\nI reached for the glove compartment, scrambling to open it. A teal box tumbled out onto the floor, opening as it landed. For a second, I thought the ring had fallen beneath the seat, never to be seen again. Then I caught the glint of it on the floor mat. Thank god Evan had been such a status whore: the diamond was huge. \n\nThe car was screaming up the hill toward certain doom, picking up speed. I didn‚Äôt have a moment to spare. I slipped the ring on my finger, pulled back my arm, and punched forward with everything I had. The glass shattered into a thousand pieces. \n\nThen, without another thought, I hoisted myself out of the car, rolling as I hit the soft grass. Two more seconds, and the car was gone, carrying Evan‚Äôs final words with it as it disappeared into the ocean.\n\nAnd as I lay there, I just started laughing, thinking of his voice still droning on underwater, lecturing the fish and mermaids with his last, stupid thoughts. \n\nAll around, it was quiet as a library, and Evan was [silent for good.](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)",
